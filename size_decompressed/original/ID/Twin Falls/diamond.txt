15 amber colored lights flew in formation.  ((anonymous report));2018-03-06 21:15:00;10 minutes;15 amber colored lights flew in formation. After just turning eastbound on Idaho 74 from Mt. Olympus Way, I witnessed an awesome display of fourteen or fifteen diamond shaped lights.  The lights were amber in color and were slowly rising into the night sky, climbing out over the fields, heading towards the southeast. Lights were grouped into a loose formation, several in front, a large group in the middle, followed by several in the rear.  I watched the formation from the driver’s seat of the truck. They couldn’t have been more than 3,000 feet in front of me, and 300 feet or less in altitude and climbing. I’d say they were all about the same size, fifteen or so feet in the middle and a little higher length-wise.  Many of them were a translucent amber color in the midsection, tapering to a hazy brighter white color at the edges. In all my years driving 74, hauling scrap from the shop, I’ve never seen anything like them.  Watching them drift away, it was as if I had startled them.  All of a sudden, they were just there, like they had just risen from the ground. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

When I tried to take a photo or video it was on screen for a brief second then disappeared completely yet I could still look in the sky and see it.  Sorry if this didn't help just figured this information could be useful.;42.5581999999999;-114.465865517241
