Huge bright light shaped as a tear drop with two tentacles changing into the color red;2015-06-08 23:00:00;1.5;huge bright light shaped as a tear drop with two tentacles changing into the color red I looked out the window at 23:00 and I saw a bright light, shaped into a teardrop, with what It seem like two tentacles moving back and forth.   So, I immediately wake up my boyfriend and he says, “Wow, that is strange!”   I couldn’t stop looking at it and I wanted to get closer to it.  I grabbed my keys and started to drive towards it, and then it disappeared and reappeared on my right side.  It just looked like it was hovering over something and after driving for 15 minutes I decided to turn back.   When I arrived at my home, the light was gone, and right when I was going to turn away, it reappeared and changed into a blood red color.  It seems to change shapes from an oval to a perfect circle.   After staring at it for about an hour and a half, looks like the mysteries object is fading away, it just keeps getting smaller and smaller.;42.5581999999999;-114.465865517241
