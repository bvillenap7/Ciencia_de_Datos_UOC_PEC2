3 orangish-red oval fireballs above Castleford;2015-02-10 21:10:00;35 minutes;3 orangish-red oval fireballs above Castleford As I left my mothers home and headed West into Twin Falls on Kimberly road I noticed 2 white light orbs in the sky above the tree and town skyline.. they were separated by 14 inches in the sky distance and the one on the left was quite a bit higher than the other. I continued to drive and pulled over 6 different times as I thought I was chasing them or getting closer to them to the West.  At the first stop the left object appeared to seperate into 2 white orb objects.  As I drove West all 3 objects were moving slowly in a low atmosphere orbit. Before my third pullover the objects were changed into orangish-red oval orb fireballs.  At that point there were 2 objects on the right..(one above and to the left of the other one.)   As I continued with my drive and stops the objects would start by being fairly dim..then brighter to bright, then fade out..they showed them selves on 4 minute intervals,, the last 2 pullovers I watched in the dark sky until they reappeared..  At my last stop they were just above the horizon to the West. There were a few other cars on the road and I hoped one would come up on me so I could get confirmation but I ended up way out in the dairy farm area with no others around. The night was crystal clear,,a bit breezy and around 40F.  Someone else had to of seen these lights from the Interstate or somewhere.  I thought they were over the Castleford area, but could have been as far west as the MHAFB or out over the the Pacific.;42.5581999999999;-114.465865517241
After taking a picture of the sunset using the zoom feature on smart phone camera, I discovered a bright green oval.  ((lens flare??));2019-05-06 20:45:00;60 seconds;After taking a picture of the sunset using the zoom feature on smart phone camera, I discovered a bright green oval object in image. I am an educated female of 57 years old who often takes in the happenings of the sky and on 5/8/19 around 8:45pm I endeavored to take a few shots of what was an aurora-like sunset (towards the Snake River Canyon in Twin Falls, ID, Latitude 42.562786,  Longitude 114.460503) and after returning to the shop where I work to take a better look at the pictures I noticed a bright green oval-like object in the upper center top part of the image.  I went back out to the same POV and zoomed in on same subject of clouds and tree framed in the earlier shot and was unable to see the same green object. ((NUFORC Note:  We haven't seen the photo, but we suspect that the green thing may be a lens flare, caused by pointing a camera at a bright source of light.  PD));42.5581999999999;-114.465865517241
