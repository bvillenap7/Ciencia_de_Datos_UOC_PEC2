White, triangular object over Twin Falls, ID;2008-07-15 16:00:00;2 minutes;White, triangular object over Twin Falls, ID I was driving on I-84 eastbound when I briefly saw a white, triangular object in the sky (fairly distant). There were no clouds, and the object left no con-trail. When I looked at the road to pass another vehicle and looked back, the object was gone. I had my attention off the object for less than 30 seconds, and there was no way a conventional aircraft could have disappeared so quickly.;42.5581999999999;-114.465865517241
Dull nosed, triangle object with no lights going slightly west of straight south at a fast speed.;2013-11-11 06:25:00;5-7 seconds;Dull nosed, triangle object with no lights going slightly west of straight south at a fast speed. Object seen was tiangular, about 140 degree front--wider than it was long.  No lights, moving very fast,  No sound, could not tell how high up it was, going south south west.  Slightly lighter than the dark sky (light from the city showed it up).   I am a carpenter, 75 years old, taught school (industrial arts--wood shop) for 5 years and have never before seen anything like this.  Stealth B-2 Bomber has more of a sharp nose.  It was going in a straight line--on an angle--like towards Jackpot, Nevada.   Viewed for only 5 to 7 seconds across the sky!!!!;42.5581999999999;-114.465865517241
