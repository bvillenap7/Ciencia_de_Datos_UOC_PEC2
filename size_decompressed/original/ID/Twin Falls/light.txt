UFO outside Twin Falls- 2002;2002-08-19 23:00:00;appr. 15 min.;UFO outside Twin Falls- 2002  500 Lights On Object0: Yes In August of 2002,  my husband and I were on the first leg of our roadtrip honeymoon.  We left Seattle in the morning, and around 11 p.m. we decided to look for a motel in Twin Falls, ID.  We saw road signs indicating that Twin Falls was within a few miles, so we began looking for the exit.  And we looked.  And we looked.  And we realized we had driven way too far, and must have missed it somehow, so we turned around and headed back the way we’d come.  Ahead of us, we saw something that at first appeared to be an airplane in the distance, but its flight pattern and speed seemed off.  The light came close enough for us to see the underside of the object, and we both knew instantly that it was a UFO.  The lights on the underside were rotating.  The object never got close enough for us to determine its shape.  We parked on the side of the road and watched as the object moved across the sky and disappeared behind some mountains.  Then we got in the car and continued to drive towards Twin Falls.  It turns out we had indeed missed Twin Falls, and we had also somehow failed to see 2 exit signs.  We weren’t paying close enough attention to the time, so I’m not sure if we were missing time, but we could never figure out how 2 people who were looking could fail to see 2 exit signs.

The blue light light up the sky and then disappeared as if it came out of nowhere.;2003-02-24 21:45:00;30 sec;The blue light light up the sky and then disappeared as if it came out of nowhere. This blue light that was unremarkably beautiful filled a small area of the sky. It came so fast and I just happened to look up and see it. I didn't here any sounds that would have encouraged me to look up into the sky. I was just driving home and for some reason I did. The light didn't seem to stay in one place, (it kinda grew and then shrunk) and then it just disappeared. At first I thought perhaps I was seeing things, but my friend said that they had seen it too. I have never seen anything so beautiful that sends chills up my spine at the same time.;42.5581999999999;-114.465865517241

A bright summer night, sitting outside spotting the stars and communication satellites. Companion was focusing a home telescope as I pointed to various bright stars, and then noticed a particularly bright white one that I had not previously seen in that area of the sky.  It began to grow steadily larger and brighter until I realized it was actually coming closer!  The bright white light seemed to be coming directly toward me for about 5 seconds and then it streaked off at a 90-degree angle and was gone in an instant.

Balls of light appeared in the sky and started moving in a way a airplane,  helicopter or meteor could not the crafts appeared in different parts of the sky disappearing and reappearing, in the south hills, and then zoomed behind us and followed us until we were almost to town.

Two amber/orange lights speed into the Northwest night sky.;2019-01-29 19:40:00;10-20 seconds;Two amber/orange lights speed into the Northwest night sky. On the night of January 29th, 2019, I was driving home from a private tutoring session when in the sky I saw two solid orange lights flying through the night sky at matching speeds,one light lower and more to the right than the other.  At first I thought it was just an airplane but then I quickly realized there was no way that was possible, it was moving too fast  and the two lights were too far apart to be an airplane.  They were flying towards the Northwest with one lower and further away from the other.  After about ten to twenty seconds they disappeared into the sky.  I being a avid fan of reading about UFO's and conspiracy theories have always enjoyed the topic but been a skeptic about it all.  Skepticism aside, I thoroughly believe that what I saw was some sort of a UFO.;42.5581999999999;-114.465865517241

An extremely bright white light followed the drivers side of my truck for almost 20 minutes.  Every 2 seconds the light would flash on, like a camera flash, then off again, then 2 seconds later flash again. Like a strobe light.  When I sped up, it sped up - to 70 mph.  When I slowed it slowed.  It went off into the adjacent field and then came back again and continued to follow.  Eventually it was right behind the truck canopy and followed for several minutes before it faded into the distance behind me and I could no longer see it.;42.5581999999999;-114.465865517241
