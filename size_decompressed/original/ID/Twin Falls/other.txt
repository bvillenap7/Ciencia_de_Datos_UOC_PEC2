The time of the year is approximate. Being that the only thing I can remember as far as the month would be arround September or possibly even October. The area I lived in was mostly farmland and the fields got plowed just before winter after the crops were harvested. I lived on route 2 Twin Falls,Idaho in a big two story home surrounded by bean and lettuce fields. It was arround 8 o'clock or so when my two brothers and myself went out to go clobber each other with dirt clots in the bean field just left of the house. The sun had just barely set wit hjust a hint of purple left in the sky. That was when the low hum and the mistlike clouds came. Kinda like a fog. We all looked up and saw a craft right above us in the field. It was about 100 feet or so high. Again this is an approximation, being I was only about 8 years old when this happened so it could have been lower. It had one main large light which made a beam shooting straight down. It didn't burn or make us feel weird or anything it was not brilliant. The beam was about the strength of a good maglite flashlite. There were off center on both sides of the light in the middle a row off smaller colored lights which changed color. We were in awe as I can remember just standing there looking at it. Off in the distance we heared sirens and soon we heard my Father pull up to the house in quite a hurry. We looked away from the craft to see our Father and the flashing lights comming down the road. When we looked back and I know it was very quickly looked back. The craft was gone. Now the strangest thing is that my Father saw this craft near the south hills as he was comming back from a customer sight, he leased farm equipement, he called the air force and they were chasing this thing. How it came to be coincidentally above us when he got home is odd. We do recall that there was some time loss because when we got back inside it was 10:45. We were not outside that long, there is just no way. The air force did investigate this sighting and questioned us and my Father the next day. I have yet to get any information from the air force on this investigation. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));42.5581999999999;-114.465865517241

And 1 above the four, as the first 4 disappeared another single light appeared south of but at the same altitude as the previous lights. Then the remaining lights disappeared like the first four .( Clear night no clouds ) I have observed this twice in the last two three months. The first time it was only 6 lights, same type of formation and as near as i can tell same spot in the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

The undidentified object materialized to the northeast of our position at approximately 22:14 PM Mountain Time.;2017-09-29 22:00:00;1:45;The undidentified object materialized to the northeast of our position at approximately 22:14 PM Mountain Time. I began recording the object at 22:15 Pm.  The object moved rapidly from its Northern position, to a position to the south.  The craft hovered in place for about 3 to four seconds, before rapidly returning to its previous location to the north. Once again the craft stopped for roughly 2 seconds, it emitted green and blue lights. A purple flash was visible each time the craft rapidly changed position (Possibly Plasma)  Could not be ruled out as a light source since we only witnessed it when the craft would move. The object than rapidly shot to the south. In the video, you can see it disappear behind my chimney, and then reappear it rapidly moved to the south and stopped again. The craft than began lowering towards the ground. I lost visual from behind my home, so I ran through my home into the drive way to see if i could capture it again. The yellow lights are nothing but street and porch lights, but for a brief period, the craft is seen once again at a different altitude heading back to the North, once again emitting what looks to me like bursts of Plasma. It disappeared,  Failed to capture anymore footage.;42.5581999999999;-114.465865517241
