I went outside to be sure of what I was seeing and sure enough it was.  After a few minutes I realized it was moving very slowly to the East.

I continued to observe as the object slowly moved East until I lost sight of it.  It was clearly some typ of craft illuminated.;42.5581999999999;-114.465865517241
