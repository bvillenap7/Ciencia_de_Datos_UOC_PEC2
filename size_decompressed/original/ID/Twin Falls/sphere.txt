Low flying green orbs;2003-07-18 22:00:00;30 minutes;Low flying green orbs I was riding my motorcycle east when out of the corner of my eye I was a flashing green light.  I turned to my right and saw a green flashing orb of what looked to be a half mile away.  Actually there were 2 or 3 of them.  They were moving away from me but thinking maybe the local airport had some type of runway approach lights I didn't think too much about it.  A few minutes later I was coming back on the same road and I saw them again.  This time they were on the other side of the road from before and coming towards me.  They passed to the right of me about 150 yards away.  They were about 20 to 30 feet above the ground and were green in color and flashing like a strobe about one flash every two seconds or so.  They looked to be traveling at about 75 to 100 mph.   I stopped to get some gas while keeping an eye on them.  One stopped about a half mile away.  It was hovering and flashing.  After I filled up I went toward it and it started moving again but was gone by the time I got into position.  I called the 911 center to inquire if anyone else had reported seeing these things.  The dispatcher told me no one had called that night but about a week earlier a policeman reported seeing the lights and just as he was about to point them out of a fireman the lights disappeared.;42.5581999999999;-114.465865517241
