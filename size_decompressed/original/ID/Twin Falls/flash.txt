Orb emitting ultra bright orange light sitting on the horizon.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus??  PD));2016-10-15 11:00:00;15 minutes;Orb emitting ultra bright orange light sitting on the horizon I was sitting outside my house in my friends car just talking and I just randomly happened to glance up toward the horizon and as I did I noticed an orb emitting a very bright solid orange light encasing the entire craft.  It was just floating in place not making any advancemt in any direction.  I know this was not a star in the sky because it was a very windy and cloudy night and you could see the clouds moving behind it plus stars don't sit that low on the horizon to begin with.  I starred at the object with my two friends for what seemed like only a few minutes and as though it noticed us watching it, it literally de-materialized and then instantly re-materialized about 250-500 yards to the left of its original position.  It floated there for a few more seconds and then literally faded into the darkness as though the craft was dimming down the external lights of the craft like you would with the light dimmer in your living room.
