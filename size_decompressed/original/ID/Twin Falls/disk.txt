I was outside having a smoke and seen a craft that was very bright pass over from West to East at the time above.  I didn't think to much of it at first, I thought it was an airliner but there was no trails and no sound.   I ran and got a spotting scope, (x50), because I didn't have a camera with film, and caught it just before it went behind the tree's. There were no wings and it was very, very bright.   I'd like to know if something was reported by anyone else.;42.5581999999999;-114.465865517241

While I was driving a bright flash caught my eye that I noticed with my peripheral vision through the driver side window.  This flash started going insane, going from almost invisible to almost moon bright in max 3 sec.   I decided to pull over and snap a picture before I could do so, the cluster of lights in round or disk figure brightened and then disappeared.   I watched the sky in shock when another brightening figure appeared, only this time there was a red glow that appeared on the center bottom of the disk like figure.  I donâ€™t know how I managed this, but I caught it on camera, one picture, one set of eyes, one crazy experience.  The photo is unedited and the only photo that was captured.;42.5581999999999;-114.465865517241
