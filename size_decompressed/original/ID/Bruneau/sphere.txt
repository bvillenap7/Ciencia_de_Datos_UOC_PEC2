Green Orb falling from sky;2003-08-12 02:30:00;10/20 seconds;Green Orb falling from sky My friend and I were traveling W. on Warm Springs Rd. which is located near Bruneau, Idaho, after providing night fire support at a USAFB bombing range in the Owyhee Desert, which is located S.E. of Bruneau Idaho. At approximatly 02:30 we noticed a large bright green orb, or sphere, similar to a round Christmas tree ornament, falling straight down from the sky to the N. of our location. It fell below horizon, and the glow from it remained for a few seconds until it died out. My friend reported this the following day by calling into the Mtn. Home AFB.  He was told by an Air Force Offical that the base landing observation tower normaly closed down at 24:00 and they had no aircraft in the area. Yeah right we new that was a lie, otherwise we would not have been providing night fire support at the Juniper Butte Range for the bombers, and fighters that fly out of that base.   Not to mention it is a strategic base, and I would think because of this alone the tower would be maned 24/7.....;42.614;-115.8419
