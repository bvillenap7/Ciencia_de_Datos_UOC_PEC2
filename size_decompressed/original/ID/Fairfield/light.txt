Row of lights headed Northeast.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-24 23:00:00;10;Row of lights headed Northeast Saw a row of perfectly straight lines headed in a north east direction.  Went to grab my camera and a second row of perfectly straight lines were heading in a north west direction between 20 or 30 lights.  Saw a bright light flash in between then vanished.   I have a video but it's not very good as the light was really dim and my cell phone isn't that sensitive.;43.3681;-114.7931
