Six orange lights with no sound in formation over Bellevue, Idaho.;2014-02-01 21:00:00;15 minutes;Six orange lights with no sound in formation over Bellevue, Idaho. My wife and I were walking our dogs at approximately 9 pm towards Bellevue, Idaho, when I looked to the southwest and saw 6 orange lights/fireballs in what could be described as an upside down cross-like formation.  They had no sound and they appeared to pulse.  They faded out at different intervals with the lowest light remaining the longest and brightest.;43.4408;-114.2474
