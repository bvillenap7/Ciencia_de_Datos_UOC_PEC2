Electric Blue EMP in central IDAHO.;2006-12-27 07:40:00;2 Seconds;Electric Blue EMP in central IDAHO I was driving to work about 6 miles south of Bellvue, Idaho and for about a period of 2 seconds the sky lit up a electric blue.  There were about 20 cars in front of me and i could see all their tail lights.  All the lights in my car plus the radio shut off and all the tail lights of the cars in front of me shut off.  Also all the snow that had collected on the power lines all fell of at once.   This event was obviuosly some kind of EMP but the question is: From What???
