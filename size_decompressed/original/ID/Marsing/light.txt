Red lights over Snake River near Marsing, Idaho;2007-08-28 21:30:00;25 minutes;Red lights over Snake River near Marsing, Idaho On 8-28-7, while fishing on the Snake River along Map Rock Road between Marsing, Idaho and Walters Ferry, Idaho, my wife notice an occasional red light slightly above the horizon to the south of our location. When I first saw it, I thought it was fireworks in the distance.  After watching for a while, I noticed that the red light would only stay on for about 3-5 seconds or so and they would all be at about the same altitude.  They would appear 1 to 3 at a time and the interval of occurrence would be every 2-4 minutes.  The lights started to appear somewhat more to west and closer in our direction.  This went on for about 20 minutes and then I noticed a horizontal line of lights appearing to the southwest of our location.  They started appearing at about 1-2 second intervals going from left to right.  After 4 or 5 lights appeared, a new light to the right of then line would appear as the one to the far left would disappear.  This continued for a total of 16 lights.  No other lights appeared after that occurrence.  The sky was clear and the moon was almost full.;43.5399;-116.824
