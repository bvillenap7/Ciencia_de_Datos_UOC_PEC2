Spotted UFO in the clear autumn night traveling across the sky in a SE direction toward an Air Force Base;2004-09-22 22:10:00;45 min;Spotted UFO in the clear autumn night traveling across the sky in a SE direction toward an Air Force Base The craft was spotted at around 10:10pm near Homedale,Idaho.  My son spotted it first because he has seen them before around the Jordan Valley, Oregon area and reported it on this site earlier this year. The night sky was clear and no other air craft was seen.  It was moving in a SE direction at a low altitude but at some distance away. It had flashing lights in sequence but they couldn't distinguish the shape.  Once my son and husband and hired hand arrived home here in Marsing, they called me outside to witness it.  When it lit up again it was still headed SE towards Mountain Home Air Force Base and that was the last time we saw it.  It was incredible to see such a site.;43.5399;-116.824
