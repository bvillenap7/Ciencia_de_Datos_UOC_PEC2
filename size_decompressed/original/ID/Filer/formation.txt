Silent, dim lit, flying stadium lights?;2020-08-13 00:58:00;15 seconds;Silent, dim lit, flying stadium lights? 00:58   08/12/2020. While sitting outside in my backyard with one other person to observe the meteor shower (which was awesome). I was the first to notice 1 set of 2, rectangular shaped lights (similar shape description of an led lightbar) gliding parallel to one another in complete silence. Dim glowing, at the same time also very pro dominant in color, at a steady almost a translucent.  The fast moving object(s) seemed to be too low, and almost too big to be quiet and too “out of place”  to compare to anything I’ve ever seen in the sky before.  I observed the formation(s) shortly after clearing the shadows of the treetops in the west at approximately 280 degrees.  I pointed it out to my family member as it glided in a straight line across the entirety of the nights sky, completely parallel to each other and seemed to glow more contrast to the sky the more it traveled toward the horizon. We watched it until we lost sight at approximately 82 degrees East.  Du! ration of the event was about 10- 15 seconds.;42.5664;-114.6177
