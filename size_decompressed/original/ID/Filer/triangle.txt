Two possible triangle objects hovering over near Highway 93/;2020-11-10 07:35:00;5 minutes;Two possible triangle objects hovering over near Highway 93/ I was driving home from work, turning west off of N 2500 E and onto 4000 N. I look in the distance and see two sets of white lights seemingly just down the road from my house. Curiosity got the better of me and I drove further down the road, realizing these things were not hardly moving. I get ready to hit Highway 93 and realize both objects were dark triangles. A police cruiser was parked at one of the sideroads, so being that morning traffic was just started I took my eyes off the objects and focused on the road, trying to find a spot where I could get a better look. I looked back at the spot I spotted them and they were both gone.;42.5664;-114.6177
