I looked up to admire the stars and noticed a stationary light formation that seemed too solid to be a regular star, especially with the smoke and haze from the nearby wildfires, sitting roughly 80 degrees into the sky from my position facing South by Southeast. Taking a moment to study it, I noticed it appeared to be an almost cylindrical shaped object that sat vertical in the air. There were four different color lights attached red on the top, darker orange in the middle, and white on the bottom. The orange lights seemed to change intensity like something small was partially blocking the light as it moved around. I pulled out my Samsung Galaxy A50, set the camera to the highest resolution settings and began taking photos. This is the moment the object began to move roughly northeast in relation to its position. A streak of light, akin to a distant passing meteor, s! hot right in front of it and made the object immediately change direction. I checked the time on my phone, realizing I was running late for work at 0046. I drove eastbound on Highway 30 going into Twin Falls to get to work by 0106. I got out of my car and found that the object was almost directly above me and managed to take a quick video of it before it suddenly went brighter and disappeared. I'm including a map photo which shows my exact positions for both sightings and exact route of travel.;42.5664;-114.6177
