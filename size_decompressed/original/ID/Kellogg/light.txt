My wife and I were on the front deck when she said, Did you see that?  I said What?  She then told me two large round lights just flew past the house (from east to west).  Ok?.... Just then 4 large lights went from north to south.  They were in pairs, two together, moving together.  Swirling back and forth with the other two.  From north to south it took them seconds when it takes jetliners 15-20 mins to do the same.  THERE WAS NO NOISE.;47.5421;-116.1294
