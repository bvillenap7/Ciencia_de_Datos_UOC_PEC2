While walking with my girl ((name deleted)) on montour rd in Emmett, Idaho, we both at the same saw plain as day something that looked and most of all moved like nothing we know of in the world.  It was low enough to the ground so it came into our view as it moved from behind the small butte down the street.  This was close, as it moved from our right to left across the edge of the horizon.  On its path it stopped and wobbled a bit then back tracked for a short length till it continued.  The color was white when going but red when it stopped or backing up.  We lost site of it as it went behind another hill across from the butte.  So much more but can't text all that i have to tell.;43.9106;-116.489
