Bright, white, blue and red flashing lights above Quigley Canyon in Hailey, Idaho.  ((anonymous report));2016-07-16 03:00:00;hours?;Bright, white, blue and red flashing lights above Quigley Canyon in Hailey, Idaho. noticed one bright semi flashing lights high above the mtns on the north side of quigley canyon. After watching through binoculars and a spotting scope, I noticed at least four other shapes flashing the same red, blue and bright white.   The closest one was the brightest, but through the Binos each one stood out.  It was almost like a police helicopter but the strobing of lights was too quick and varying, sometimes it would really get bright.  From a distance it looked like it had a pyramid shape of light around it.  Moved some at the begining, but then seemed to stay in the same place.  Too high up for a helicopter and also way over the middle of nowhere, also hovering in the same place for at least an hour.  No sound.
