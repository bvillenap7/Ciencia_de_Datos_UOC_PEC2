Several orange spheres hovering over Hailey, Idaho.;2014-01-08 18:20:00;3-5 minutes;Several orange spheres hovering over Hailey, Idaho. Heard a loud noise like a sonic boom, dogs went nuts barking.  So I went out the front door to see what was going on and up in the sky above Della and Carbonate mountains were about six orange spherical lights floating in the sky,  Called my wife to see the lights, was thinking maybe an aircraft had crashed due to the loud noise then realized the lights were hovering.  No noise at all.  Two larger than the other three or four.  They hovered for several minutes and then several of them moved off and faded away. The two larger orange lights hovered near each other and then moved in close to each other almost touching and then moved away - then they were gone.
