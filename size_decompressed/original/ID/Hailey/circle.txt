We were startled to see a black hole in the center of the round light with a band of black protruding from the left side and which changed to the right side, and on the opposite side of the black circle was a slight bulge.  We also viewed the moon to make sure our telescope was working correctly and it was.  If this is Venus, why does it have this peculiar black circle in front of it?  Has any one else seen this object tonight? ((NUFORC Note:  Description seems consistent with the location and appearance of Jupiter.));43.5236;-114.2967
