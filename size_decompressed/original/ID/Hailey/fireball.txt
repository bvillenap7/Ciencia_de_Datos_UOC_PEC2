While visiting with my neighbor on the road next to our homes last night, we looked up into the evening sky (still light out and clear sky), and an orb of light appeared and traveled about 100 yards directly above our heads from south west to north east at a very slow and steady rate.  It eventually burned out and disappeared with no trace.  Like a very large, up close shooting star traveling slowly through the sky.  Too low to be a satellite or airplane. Literally just above our heads.  Took our breath away.  There is known to be ufo activity in our canyon and perhaps we have now witnessed them up close and personal.;43.5236;-114.2967
