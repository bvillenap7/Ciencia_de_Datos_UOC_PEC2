I saw a string of lights in the sky that looked to be the same size and brightness as the stars. They were in a diagonal line, straight line perfectly spaced out. I went to get a person close by to come and see what I was seeing. As I looked back to the sky, the lights were leaving one by one and disappearing until none were left.;43.5236;-114.2967
