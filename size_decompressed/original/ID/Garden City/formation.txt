The object contained about 50 discrete lights that move gracefully along almost right above me.  At any given time, I could only see about 10 lights spaced equally part.  The object or objects appeared to be part of a single string because they did not appear to move independently from each other.  After about a minute I could not see the lights anymore either because they were obscured by clouds or because they moved beyond my range of vision.  They did not simply turn off all of a sudden.  Rather, they seemed to flow away from my vision to a point where I could no longer see them.;43.7308;-116.281
