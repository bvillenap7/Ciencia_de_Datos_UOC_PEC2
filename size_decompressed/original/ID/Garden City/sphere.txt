3 Bright Hovering Spheres in night sky;2021-01-31 23:50:00;>20 minutes;3 Bright Hovering Spheres in night sky As we were driving into our apartment building near midnight on 1/31/2021 I looked up to see the stars.  I immediately noticed a very bright light and asked my son if he could see it. I was driving and pulled over so we could both look.  I observed at least 2 and possibly 3 of these lights. The objects seen by using the zoom of my camera were not recognizable as an aircraft or helicopter. The objects were not moving in any direction but occasionally would seem to move very quickly laterally and then return to the prior position.  Sometimes it seemed like the object would get dim and then get bright again.  We sat and watched them and decided to park in our stall and get out of the car.  I got my camera and started to video one of the lights. It was spinning and changing colors and it appeared some type of discharge was coming from the object.  I was able to video 2 of the objects.  I then called my daughter who lives 30 miles away and she went outside and also can! see them.  Also her husband and 3 children watched the objects as they hovered. I am a 60 year old retired church going woman raising my 16 year old son. I have my Bachelors degree in computer science and worked at Microsoft for 8 years. My daughter who also saw this is a former 911 operator for the local sheriffs office, and currently getting her Master's degree in criminal justice.;43.7308;-116.281
