Quick Flashing Object Ascends Over Fair Grounds And Pulses Motionless In Sky;2010-08-24 16:05:00;4 minutes;Quick Flashing Object Ascends Over Fair Grounds And Pulses Motionless In Sky Went outside to the back of my work building to have a smoke and was looking north towards the fair grounds.  I was looking at one of the amusement park rides and noticed ascending right above it was a silver flashing metallic object that appeared at first glance to be a (chrome)  mylar balloon rising up.   The object then began to rise at a much faster rate and the flashing of silver light became brighter not dimmer with altitude gain.  The object rose straight up at least 500 feet from where I first saw it and was not affected by any winds aloft that would usually sway a balloon horizontally.   The object than became fixed in the sky in a perfect stop/non swaying motion and continued to pulse with flashes of silver going dim to very bright.   Some employees from a neighboring business had just come out the back of their building and I pointed the object out to them, the three of us watched for a few more minutes as the object continued to stay fixed in the ! sky as it pulsed.    Then the pulse stopped and the object was completely gone.;43.7308;-116.281
