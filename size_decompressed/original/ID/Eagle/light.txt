Changing lights on rapid ascent and descent;2015-02-26 20:50:00;30 seconds;changing lights on rapid ascent and descent There was a light in the clouds tonight.  I observed a bright red light moving quickly In a horizontal ascent, on a rapid descent the light changed to light blue.  It was moving up and down in rapid and erratic fashion.   I watched for about 30 seconds on the last descent it left vertically and was quickly out of sight.;43.70584;-116.358912857143
