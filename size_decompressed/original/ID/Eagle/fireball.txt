A bright fire ball light hovering in the lower sky over Boise Eagle  area.;2009-10-05 20:10:00;4 minutes;A bright fire ball light hovering in the lower sky over Boise Eagle  area. I was just leaving Albertsons at about 8:10 Pm when in the North east lower part of the sky by Boise's foot hills I could see a strange light that I thought looked like a fireball falling out of the sky. The only thing is that it seem to stay in the same place for a long time. I knew it was not a airplane, because they can't stay in the same spot.  I was sure it could not have been a helacopter either. I still drove toward it thinking maybe it was a tall, bright street lamp. It then started to move across the sky toward Boise, to the South east. I followed for a few miles trying to get a better glimpse of it, then it was gone. I drove back in to Eagle when either the same one or another went across the sky again. We had a better look at it, and still could not figure out what it was.;43.70584;-116.358912857143
