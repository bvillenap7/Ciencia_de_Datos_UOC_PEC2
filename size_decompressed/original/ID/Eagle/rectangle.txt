We were facing south when we noticed a bright, light green, square object crossing the sky horizontally, travelling west to east.  It moved very quickly, faster than a jet but slower than a shooting star.  We watched for about 10 seconds before the houses and trees obstructed out view of it.  It was quite large, about the size of the moon from our vantage point.;43.70584;-116.358912857143
