After I gave my speach and then I telepathically contacted them and the great start appeared 1/3 up from the horizon as a big bright start as it approached us we could see that it was round, glowing, very large and very slowly passed over us to the east.   That was in confimration fo Mr. Solem's Hopi message and flying saucer warning at Jensen Lake in Blackfoot, Idaho, that confirmed teh subject matter.   The host was former personal secreatary and advisor to the Hopi Indian Chiefs, the only white man given that postition and calling.   The next lecture will be held on August 27th and September 3rd at dusk, if weather is clear, at Jensen Lake in Blackfoot, Idaho.;43.1943000000001;-112.3615
