I'm not one who believes in UFO's but what I saw last night gives me pause.   We were on our way to the symphony in Pocatello and as we drove by the Blackfoot airport on Teeples about 5:45 PM give or take a few seconds straight away and somewhat to our left (southeast) we saw partially hidden in relatively low clouds a series of golden yellow lights in pairs.   They would have had to be fairly large, just sitting in the sky motionless.  They were grouped in such a way that at first I thought someone had erected a huge crane with scattered lights on the metal framework but then I realized just how far up they were and I was struck by the lack of motion.   They lasted about 90 seconds and just faded away never changing their formation.   Kind of creepy.  I've heard of theories that these are reflections from earth but these didn't look like any reflection I know of because the clouds were passing by them partially hiding them so somehow the reflection would have had to pass to the other side of the clouds and not be obscured by the cloud formation.   Additionally these were very bright lights well circumscribed unlike any reflected light I've seen.  Have you ever seen anything like this?;43.1943000000001;-112.3615
