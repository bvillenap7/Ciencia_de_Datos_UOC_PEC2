Four lights in two sets, each set rotating/spiraling going north and changing red and white.;2000-06-23 00:15:00;15 sec.;Four lights in two sets, each set rotating/spiraling going north and changing red and white. I just got out of my pickup and I was facing west.  I looked straight up and noticed four dim lights at first (north bound)I thought that they might be an aircraft but they were too dim and didn't flash.  I spun around so that I was facing east to get a better look at the lights.  I noticed that the four lights were in two sets.  The four lights were flying in a square formation.  The best way to describe the two sets is one set of two lights was east and the other set of two lights were west.  Each set looked like it was rotating/spiraling and changing red and white.  Their direction didn't change and continued to go north. I tried to point them out to another person but they were unable to see them and they faded from my view.  I waited for about two minutes to see if there was any sound that would help identify the sighting but there was none I could hear of.;43.1943000000001;-112.3615
Saw orange glowing balls in the sky, created a formation and disappeared.;2012-12-08 17:45:00;5 minutes;Saw orange glowing balls in the sky, created a formation and disappeared. We saw about 13 orange glowing balls staggered in a line in the sky.  They were floating very slowly towards the ground.  Then they started going up at an angle and turned into a formation and started slowly vanishing.I did get a picture of one glowing ball, once my camera unfroze. I google what I found and found a ton of people have seen the same image.;43.1943000000001;-112.3615
