At the speed it was traveling, It was extremely quiet.  We grabbed the binoculars and It appeared to be an asteroid.  He noticed that the object (traveling from the west to the east ) suddenly turned south east direction.  There was no sound at all coming from the object.  The light very quickly grew dimmer and awe saw 3 aircraft behind the first object.  Two had flashing green and red lights and the other had amber lights flashing.  They appeared to be chasing the first object.  None of the aircrafts we witnessed produced any sounds.  The first lighted object was incredibly fast and was almost instantly (within 15 seconds) gone from view.;42.3528;-111.3244
