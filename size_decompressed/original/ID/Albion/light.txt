Possible mother ship launching smaller crafts;2019-12-22 15:45:00;30 minutes;Possible mother ship launching smaller crafts Albion ID - Last night(12/22/2019 at about 6:45 PM there was a super bright light above the Albion mountains to the west.  I would guess above Willow Creek.  I at first thought it was a snowmobile on the ridge but I then seen it was above the mountain.  Very bright light.  Then all these star looking objects came from it in a perfect straight line heading east overhead. Way way up there.  They looked like stars but all were moving in a perfect line. When they got right above (straight up) they disappeared.  They kept coming and coming...probably 30 to 50 of them.  Then the light just disappeared from the western horizon and they quit coming.  After the last one was gone I started to see a few returning but going slower and heading more SSW than where the bright light was at. Almost like they were returning from a mission.  My thought are that I seen a mother ship of some sort and it sent out a bunch of smaller cra fts.  A few airplanes went by while I was watching these UFO's and the planes were wa! y below them.  I kid you not they looked like stars except they were is a perfect straight line moving east and very evenly spaced apart.  This whole episode lasted about 25 to 30 minutes.  Surely someone else must have witnessed this phenomenon as can offer an explanation.  Nothing on the news about it this morning.  Did anyone else see this awesome sighting?  BTW I do not drink or take drugs so I was not hallucinating.;42.3885;-113.5516
