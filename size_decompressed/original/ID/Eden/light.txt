Got a call from my stepfather telling us his friend noticed a weird object with red, blue and white lights on it.  The lights made up the entire object.  It was pretty far off but with binoculars we could tell that the lights resembled the color of cop car lights but in the air.  They did not move at all for the course of time we saw them besides the flicker of the lights together.  The blue and red are the ones that seemed to flash, the white didn't that we know of.;42.5884;-114.2518
