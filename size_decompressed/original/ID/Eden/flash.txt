Large short duration flash of lightly green tinted light that brightened the entire horizon 10 miles away.;2016-12-22 03:00:00;flash;Large, short duration flash of lightly green tinted light that brightened the entire horizon 10 miles away. 10 miles north of Eden, on the night of December 21, or specifically 3 am on Dec. 22, 2016 two very large green tinted flashes occurred in the eastern horizon and large scale in nature...approximately 5 to 10 miles wide.  It lighted up the eastern horizon and I tried to video it.   I was working in the desert all night for two nights on a scientific study.  I watched intently and it again occurred at 6 am.   The next day when I was listening to the radio station 98 FM The Snake, they announced that other people had witnessed this too.  I don't know if it was a UFO, but it was the closest thing I've ever seen to something related to UFO's...it was really amazing.;42.5884;-114.2518
