We spotted two light objects parallel just as the sun was setting.  It was still light and the objects were very bright.  As it got dark we noticed more lights in pairs parallel to each other.  We counted 12 pairs.  They set in the sky at the same position for approximatly 30 mins.  They started to move in different directions.  They would be bright as they went across the sky and then would go dim and then a large flash of white and disappear.  For over two hours we have witnessed numerous solid white lights moving different directions for considerable distance across the sky.;43.9308;-112.1872
