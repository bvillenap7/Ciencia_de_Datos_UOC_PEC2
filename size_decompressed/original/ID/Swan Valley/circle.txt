Circle of light falling.;2014-07-28 23:55:00;5 seconds;Circle of light falling. It lasted only several seconds.   It was a light circle falling from the sky like a meteor, but with no tail.  And it fell straight from the sky!  It was dark out so.  It sort of looked like the moon was falling.  I only saw it.  So I took my dad outside and there was no fire or more lights just that.;43.4556;-111.342
