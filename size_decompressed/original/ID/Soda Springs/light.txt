At 0422, I stepped out for a cigarette break at work.  I am a sidereal astrologer and frequently observe the night sky to familiarize myself with constellations. Upon looking up from my phone, I see a bright, I mean bright, light that could be no less than 55 degrees in altitude.  I appeared to be the brightest satellite I had ever witnessed. Intrigued, I continued to watch.  Crouching a using a tree as a point of reference, I noticed it wobbling from side-to-side.  Furthermore, its speed was constantly changing: speeding, and the slowing (to nearly a halt).  It then proceeded to deviate from its original apparent orbital path, heading more South, rather than East (as originally).  It began fading and varying in its luminosity. In a clear sky.  Now, extremely attentive, I watched as it totally faded from the sky.  Only to reappear to the far south, in a span of seconds - much too short for that of a satellite to travel within - Not to mention it was heading a completely different path by this point. Satellites do not deviate from a fixed orbital path so quickly or noticeably.  Satellites do not wobble.  Conventional aircraft do not have a fixed, steady lighted vehicle that seems to fall side-to-side like a feather.;42.6707;-111.5736
