White light instantly darting and stoping multiple times;2018-09-13 22:30:00;2-3 minutes;White light instantly darting and stoping multiple times Looking East towards American Falls, ID, from the Crystal Ice Cave area of Craters of the Moon, I saw what looked like the bright white hunting light of a small plane heading in my direction.  I estimated it to be approximately 10-15 miles away.  It then turned to my right, so I was seeing the light from the side I judged it to be flying about 60 miles per hour.  Nothing but the one light was visible.  It moved slowly South for 10-15 seconds.  I could not hear it. It then made a series of 3 or 4 short darts forward, stopping for a second or 2 each time.  It instantly moved about a quarter of a thumb width at arm's length each time it jumped.  That was followed by two longer jumps, each more than a thumb width.  Each of the jumps was almost instantaneous,, but I could always see the light.  It did not blink out and reappear but rather just a very quick dart.   About 5 seconds later it moved into the clouds and never reappeared.;42.6352;-112.9458
