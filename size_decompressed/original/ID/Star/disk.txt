We grabbed some binoculars. Through the binoculars you could see that it was a saucer with lights in the middle of the craft and the entire craft was spinning. It when from north west and continued to the north east before I could not longer see it. I tried to get video but it did not turn out. There where four of us that seen this.;43.7013;-116.4967

While sitting outside in our backyard, my wife noticed something high in the sky and asked me if it was a drone.  I looked toward Northwest to see a glimmering light high above our backyard slowly moving toward the North. The object looked metallic and made no noise.  I pulled out my phone and began to take photos to see if I could zoom in for a better look.  After reviewing the Live Photoâ€™s, I was surprised to see it as a shining metal disc reflecting the sun.  I was expecting a drone but after review it had me scratching my head.  I saved the photos in hope someone else witnessed the same event.;43.7013;-116.4967
