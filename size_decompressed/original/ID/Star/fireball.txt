We (5 of us in our driveway - and about 15 people in the driveway across the street) were right in the middle of lighting fireworks.  Of course there were sky rockets and mortars going off all over the place,  HOWEVER.   At about 10:45 pm a fairly bright (3 on a scale of 5) Orange Reddish light (which appeared to be pulsating slightly) SUDDENLY APPEARED IN THE SKY AT ABOUT 25 DEGREES ABOVE THE HORIZON,   It came from the direction that dozens of small, medium, and very large Aircraft per hour do on approach to the BOISE Airport.  BUT LANDING LIGHTS ARE WHITE, THIS WAS A BRILLIANT REDDISH ORANGE. out of the NNE and headed slowly and silently to the SSW and then CHANGED COURSE to a more due S direction.   It was hard to determine the altitude.  IT WAS DEFINITELY NOT ANY KIND OF FIREWORKS, HELICOPTER, AIRCRAFT, there were no strobing running lights at all.  IT COULD HAVE BEEN A SATELLITE AS THE SUN HAD JUST DROPPED BELOW THE HORIZON ABOUT AN HOUR AGO.  BUT IT WAS TOO BRIGHT AND SEEMED MUCH CLOSER.  It could have been a chinese lattern that some Yahoo let loose.  HOWEVER - IT JUST APPEARED IN THE SKY ALL OF A SUDDEN - NO CLOUDS.    My step daughter tried to get a video on her phone but couldnt really get a lock on it.  But everybody witnessed it and went Hmmmm. That is no airplane. or firework or satellite.  And it deviated in its flight path. Over the years, I have observed several anomolies.  Just being in the right place at the right time, I suppose.   And paying the slightest attention to the sky, its not that unusual.  This was not the spookiest or the hardest thing I have seen.   There was another sighting back in 1999 when I lived in Boise that was a formation of little red lights moving in spiral pattern silently overhead maybe 500 ft. (2 witnesses) I could give the details on that one sometime if your interested. I am VERY familiar with Aviation and space technology,  I can identify most commercial and militray Aircraft.  Aircraft and theory of flight, running lights on aircraft.  I watch satellites all the time.  I know how they track across the sky typically, etc. Thank you.,  Robert in Star;43.7013;-116.4967
