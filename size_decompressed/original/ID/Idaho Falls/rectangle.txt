I was driving on a remote streach of road when sudenly out of nowhere a blinding light came up behind me and seemed to be right on my bumper. having a fast car i speed up to 85mph then 100mph then 125mph but it was still right on my bumper I mean 6 off my bumper. well I had some protection with me so I slowed down to 20mph and it didnt pass so I being mad at this point puled over to confront it. as soon as i opened my door it vanished, I could see 5 miles in all directions and there was nothing anywhere. Its apperance was a 12'x8' rectangle with 25 bright lights on it. OH I forgot to mention I did seem to loose about 2 hrs ((NUFORC Note:  Witness identifies himself.
