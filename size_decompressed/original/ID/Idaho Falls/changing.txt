All except ((Name deleted)) were about 13.  ((Name deleted)) was 15.  We are sisters and ((Name deleted))  was our friend.  The 4 of us were lying on the trampoline.  Suddenly ((Name deleted)) sees something.  It appeared from behind the large pine tree.  We were looking East, it moved from North to South.  It was sort of shaped like a slanted T.  It had little orange cicles along it.  It was very dark.  It was an outline, really, with circles on it.  It changed shape, which frightened us.  It glided very smoothly.  It was too low to be any kind of aircraft, too quite too.  It made a slight pulsing humming sound.  It eventually disappeared out of view.  We stayed outside.  A few minutes later another one flew by.  It was sort of H-shaped.  The circles blinked lighter and darker, and some blinked on and off.  It came from the same place and moved the same.  It gave a high-pitched beeping sound.  It followed the other's path and was out of view in a few minutes.  We were spooked enough, s!o we went inside.;43.5063128919861;-111.977410801394
