3 lights above a well known park;1999-06-25 22:00:00;10 seconds;3 lights above a well known park I was playing a night game with some friends at Tautphaus Park (a well known, very large park) and I was running away from friends across a large field.  I looked up as I was running and saw 3 lights moving in a consistent formation.  They seemed too low to be an airplane and too high to be a toy.  As they moved along they began to weave and zoom among each other.  There was no pattern to how they were moving.  They were moving short distances really fast.  After a few seconds of this movement they shot off out of sight.  This is the only sighting I have had.  I am not a sci-fi freak.  I am a reliable college grad.  This is not a hoax.

Strange blue light lite up the inside of my pick up truck while driving back roads to my house.;2004-12-24 23:00:00;2 minutes;Strange blue light lite up the inside of my pick up truck while driving back roads to my house My wife and I were driving our 1992 Toyota Truck from Idaho Falls to Shelley, traveling the back roads to get to our home.  It was winter and just happened to be Christmas eve.  The roads were covered in snow, but it was not snowing, but it was cloudy out.  We turned right at an intersection and began traveling due west, when the inside of the cab of the truck began to light up with a soft glowing blue light.  It was a dim light, but visible.  I could not see the source of the light, but both my wife and I saw the blue hue reflecting off the dashboard, radio and interior space of the truck cab.  I immediately stopped the truck on the road and asked me wife if she saw the light and she confirmed she did.  I looked behind us, to the side and front and saw no person, no other vehicles or anything that might have caused this to happen.  I did a u-turn and slowly drove back to the area on the road this happened to see if a house light, laser pointer or possible flood light from properties close to the road, but saw nothing.  The closest house, was a n outbuilding about 200-300 feet away from the road.  We were confused and drove back to the west again and proceeded home.  We did not see a craft, we did not hear a noise, or anything out of the ordinary outside of this singular blue light seemingly terminating from the inside of our truck from an unknown source.  A few days later, my wife recounted this event to her sister who lives due north in Sugar City ID.  This same sister, the same night and time, was driving home and experienced the exact same light in her own car.  Seems too good to be true, but it happened and we all stand by it.;43.5063128919861;-111.977410801394
Bright lights unlike any traditional aircraft.;2007-08-19 10:30:00;30 sec;Bright lights unlike any traditional aircraft. Objects were moving in a large triangle formation. The leader's radience of light was far suppior than the other two following behind. They seemed to move at the same rate of speed. Moving from the west in an eastward path over Idaho Falls. I have seen similar lights in the past, but they were always solo. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

5-6 Shapeless floating lights.;2012-12-31 20:00:00;5 minutes;5-6 Shapeless floating lights. My husband and I were headed east out of a subdivision when I looked up towards the sky and noticed several red lights floating. The lights were headed north and were in no particular shape. Once my husband noticed them we pulled over and turned off the car to hear any noise, there was silence. At first we thought they were the windmills on the foothills in the horizon but the lights were too close and almost right above us. Once they started moving north they hit a patch of clouds and completely disappeared.;43.5063128919861;-111.977410801394
Extremely fast, faint lights traveling away from very bright flash in sky.;2014-05-20 23:26:00;40 seconds;Extremely fast, faint lights traveling away from very bright flash in sky. I was outside stargazing and I noticed a bright flash to the east and slight north of my driveway.   After looking for the location of the lash i saw a very faint light, very high in the sky traveling incredibly fast, headed away to the south east from where the flash of light was.  I followed it until i could no longer see the object.   I then focused my attention to where the flash was and i saw 2 to 3 more faint lights traveling unbelievably fast across the sky, with one of them sort of zig-zagging in the same direction as the first.   They were all travelling so high and fast when I stopped looking I realized this was almost science fiction to which i had just witnessed.   To this I swear is truth on my name and my children, as happend on 05/20/2014.   I hope to find what these strange sky phenomena are.

I could only see the lights and it's possible they were Chinese lanterns but not sure.;43.5063128919861;-111.977410801394
