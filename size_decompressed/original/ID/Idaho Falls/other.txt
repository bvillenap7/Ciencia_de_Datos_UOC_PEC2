WHAT APPEARED TO BE A DUAL ENGINE PROP JET FLEW OVER MY HOUSE AT NIGHT, HAD NO LIGHTS AND THERE WAS NO SOUND;1997-08-15 22:00:00;5 seconds;WHAT APPEARED TO BE A DUAL ENGINE PROP JET FLEW OVER MY HOUSE AT NIGHT, HAD NO LIGHTS AND THERE WAS NO SOUND I am not sure of the exact date or even the correct year, but it is safe to say it was within the last 5 years and it seems like it was in the summer because i remember it being warm at the time. I woke up in the night and looked out the north window of my house in Idaho Falls, Idaho, about 2 miles south of the Idaho Falls Airport and I saw what appeared to be a dual engine prop jet flying directly over my house. It wasn't a very dark night, but what was weird about this whole thing is that there were no lights on this aircraft and it made no noise. If anyone else saw this I would like to hear about it.

Very large wedge (flying wing) with tall winglets (Looked to be about 15 to 20 feet tall)at each wing tip. There were what looked to be;1998-09-06 22:15:00;1 to 2 Minutes;Very large wedge (flying wing) with tall winglets (Looked to be about 15 to 20 feet tall)at each wing tip. There were what looked to be virtical windows or lights about 16 X 60 in the winglets and several across the bottome of the wedge. The craft appeared in the south and flew to the north.  It took about 2 minutes from the time I first saw it until it was completely out of sight.  The wedge was flying about 500 to a 1000 feet above the ground and made no noise. I live near the southern end of the local airport.  We only have a couple inbound night flights.  I went out to get some air and look at the stars.  I looked up at the dig dipper then looked to the south.  I thought the 10:30p.m. flight was comming in a few nimutes early.  I noticed that the plane had on what seemed to be landing lights.  I also noticed that it seemed to be comming in pretty darn fast.  It did not slow down when it should have nor did it desend as it got closer.  The object was not following the normal routeen.  It Passed almost directly overhead so I was able to get a very good look at it.  As it approached I could see it was not shaped like the 737 that normally came in at 10:30 p.m.  The wingletts at the located at the tip of eash wing looked to be about 20 feet tall and had 4 virtical lights or windows on each side of the winglett.  These lights or windows looked simular to a two tube, four foot, floresnt light. There was a row of these lights or windows on the under side of the leading edge of the flying wedge.  I tried to call the control tower to ask if they had seem it.  They would not take any calls, the next day I went over to the control tower to ask if they had any notification of the craft and was told NO!  I have not talked to anyone else who say it.  The craft was about 500 to a 1000 feet of the deck it made absolutely NO sound as it spead up to the north. I watched it from horizen to horizen and it only took about 2 minutes do disapera into the northern sky.;43.5063128919861;-111.977410801394
It looked like a ring with no lights....;2014-03-26 21:14:00;7 seconds;It looked like a ring with no lights.... My husband I were driving down Woodruff going north and we saw a circle in the clouds. I was on the phone and when we saw it my phone call dropped.   At first we thought it was just the clouds till we saw it moving. It looked like it was vibrating, or doing what teenagers do swerving in a car driving down the road. It was heading southeast. It looked like a ring.  There were no lights on it, and all aircraft has to have lights.  It was as close as the clouds were to the ground, and was about 150-200 ft in diameter.   The color of it was almost like the clouds, camouflage, but the clouds were moving so fast it couldn't mask itself.   We immediately pulled over and got out to look but it was gone.;43.5063128919861;-111.977410801394
