Beauty in the sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly a sighting of Sirius.  PD));2013-10-30 05:00:00;90 minutes;Beauty in the sky. I happened to look out my bedroom window at 5 am I could not help, but to notice all the stars in the sky were gone, but one that looked like the brightest star I have ever seen, I stared at it for a minute than something didn't seem right, it started to move slowly to the west, this was in the south west also, it only moved a few times than stopped,  I watched it for a good hour and a half until the morning rise came up, than it vanished and was not visible to the eye. It was too high to be a plane, and it was to low to be a Russian satellite.   I was intrigued by it, I have never seen such in my entire life, it reflected like a Diamond does, there is no way to explain this, it was just a beautiful sighting, it was much brighter than a star, but it also could have been there longer,  I just did not see it because it blended into the stars that were their earlier.  I thought I was going crazy so I had someone else look at it also, at first they did not see it I ! had to point where to look, the brightness of it was enough for them to also see it, but the brightness was faded a little, but still visible for them to see. The next evening I looked in the same direction and it was not visible then. ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Sirius, we suspect.  PD));43.5063128919861;-111.977410801394
