Fast, low flying, Boomerang, no sound!;2000-09-15 22:45:00;2 to 3 minutes;Fast, low flying, Boomerang, no sound! I live 1/4 mile East of the South end of the local airport, there was a 22:25 evening arrival every night.  I was standing on my driveway looking South when I saw what looked like the landing lites of the evening flight of a Boeing 737.  As the object continued in from the South it was not decending as it normally would so I watched to see what was going on (at this time I looked at my watch to see if it was the regular flight at 22:25 P.M.) After checking the time (now 22:45) I was courious as to what was flying so low but not continuing to decend as usual.  As the craft approached I began to see its shape, it was a Boomerang or Delta wing shape.  I looked to be no more than 500 or 600 feet off the ground, the wing span was about 200 feet and each wing tip was fitted with a winglette which extended 90 degrees virtically maybe 10 or 15 feet. Each winglette was fitted with what looked like little windows or lites simular in size to a 1 ft by 4 ft floresent lite.  The leading edge of the underside of the wings on each side had 3 rowes of simular windows or lites the first row had 4 end to end the second row had 3 end to end, row 3 had 2 end to end.  The craft was flying about 10 degrees West of due North and eventually disappeared from view.  The craft had no markings, no blinking lites on the wing tips or the under side of the craft only two forward facing lites that appeared to be landing lites.  I watched it fly from South to Notrht for 2 to 3 minutes.  This craft made no sound and flew very fast!  I would venture it was Military.  Since I hang out with the Delta ground crew I ask them if they had seen it, they said they were busy with the evening flight and didn't notice it.  I tryed to contact the FAA tower people but they did not return my calls.  It was very interesting to see, I wonder if anyone else has seen something simular? ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Fast moving boomerang shaped.;2013-05-04 02:00:00;1 hour;Fast moving boomerang shaped. Several sightings of boomerang shaped flying objects at different elevations throughout the sky. Silent and extremely fast moving.  Would appear out of nowhere and would glide across the sky for a couple of seconds before disappearing.   The close ones resembled a flock of white birds flying in triangular formation.   The smaller and ones further away looked like a hazy triangular cluster of moving stars.  Have witnessed these same flying objects on a couple different dates as well;43.5063128919861;-111.977410801394
