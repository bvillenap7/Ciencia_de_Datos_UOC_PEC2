Straight Formation of Lights - Disappearing in Sky.  ((Starlink satellites??));2019-12-22 19:30:00;10 minutes;Straight Formation of Lights - Disappearing in Sky Looking up at Southwest Sky, saw a straight line formation of lights spaced perfectly apart.   Lights moving towards the Northeast however the lights disappeared, one by one in the middle of the night sky.   No clouds, no sound, clear night sky.   Saw plenty of stars and incoming planes but these lights were way higher than the local incoming and outgoing plane route.;43.5063128919861;-111.977410801394
