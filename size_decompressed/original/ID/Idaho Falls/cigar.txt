My initia;2005-03-17 08:30:00;20-30 minutes;From my driveway, due South, I observed a jetstream in the sky and saw a plane descending rapidly straight down vertical.  My initial thoughts were that it was an airplane that would veer out momentarily.  When it didn't happen, I thought the craft was going to crash and I was growing very concerned when suddenly, the speeding plane just stopped and was vertically suspended in the sky.  It was then I noticed that the plane was shaped like a long missile, I checked cigar shape.  It could be clearly seen though it did appear to have some haziness around it.  I was mesmerized and watched the craft just hang there, vertically, for quite some time.  After 10 minutes, I wanted to get a better view, so I went into the garage and got my binoculars and stepped out on the back deck.   The craft was still there and though I was able to see it better, I saw no unusual markings.   After quite a while, the craft suddenly shifted from vertical and took off leaving a jetstream behind, vanishing into the east sky.   Awesome. ((NUFORC Note:  We presume the witness means a contrail, rather than a jetstream.  The latter is a meteorological phenomenon.  PD));43.5063128919861;-111.977410801394
