I soon r;1998-07-13 23:05:00;20-30 Seconds;Saw two triangular objects in near proximity of each other with circular white lights near the points of each of the objects.  I soon realized something was out of the ordinary after viewing the objects for a few seconds. I was letting my dog outside just before I was going to go to bed. It was just after 11:00 PM and I opened the back door and looked up at the big dipper thinking to myself how clear a night it was.  I then something moving that caught my eye.  About 35 degrees up from the horizon I noticed 2 triangular objects in close proximity of each other with dull white circular lights close to the point of each object. As soon as I realized what I was seeing, one object moved off to my right and faded into the backgound of the sky.  I quickly focused on the other object and tracked it as it moved to my left.  While trying to keep track of where it was in the sky I called out to a family member to quickly come and look at the object.  We both stood in the door way looking at it for a few seconds.  The white circular lights on each of the points then independently converged in toward the center while the object was still, as a whole, moving to the right.  It then faded out of sight. There was no sound and I estimate that they were a couple miles southwest of Idaho Falls.  The triangular shape of the objects stood out since the bodies of the objects were darker than the background sky which was partially illuminated by city's lights.;43.5063128919861;-111.977410801394

I saw it come out of the clouds.  It was a black equal sided triangle.  ((anonymous report));2016-10-15 18:00:00;6-7 seconds;It was a cloudy day when this happened.  I was in the back yard jumping on the trampoline when I heard a really loud boom in the sky coming from the West.  My dog was very spooked and he ran under the trampoline and whimpered.  I looked up into the cloudy sky and heard a faint whoosh sound in the clouds.  I heard it turn and head North.  Then I saw it come out of the clouds.  It was a black equal sided triangle.  It left no jet stream behind and it went back into the clouds.  It was very very fast and this whole sighting lasted for about six seconds.
