Witnessed 1 object large in size (can not approx. how big) approx. 3/4 mile away hovering approx. 1000-2000 feet  high. There was telephone pole, and the object was behind the pole.  The pole was approx. 20-30 feet away. First saw the object mid to high side on the pole. The object rose and hovered Apr 15 sec before shooting across the sky in a rainbow fashion ( in approx. 1 sec) to the left and hovered for 2 min on the left side approx. 1/2 mile away. Could see it through the tree that was in the back yard. The object was orange, red, yellow, with a dome shape on top and a think band in the middle with no definition of a bottom. It made a low hum sound as it flew across over head in a rainbow fashion. It was brighter on the left than on the right by the telephone. After approx. 2 min it just disappeared.;43.5063128919861;-111.977410801394
Strange Sighting over Taylor Mountain, Idaho Falls, Idaho 8/28/2019;2019-08-28 00:00:00;10 minutes;Strange Sighting over Taylor Mountain, Idaho Falls, Idaho 8/28/2019 Driving to Taylor Mountain just seeing how rough our little Jeep is on backroads.  I took a video of odd shape in sky.  It was quiet and hovering then slowly disappeared like it was becoming invisible. Taylor Mountain is a short distance South and East of Idaho Falls.  Many people have reported strange sightings even moving lights I tried several ways to add contrast and isolate the pictures in my video.  I will include. I thought very interesting. Not frightening just fun to imagine.;43.5063128919861;-111.977410801394
