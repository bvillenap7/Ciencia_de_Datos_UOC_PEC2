Large black triangle at high altitude moving NW to SE at slow rate.;2004-05-14 22:38:00;8 minutes;Large black triangle at high altitude moving NW to SE at slow rate. Just now my wife and I were out in the front yard trying to locate Comet NEAT with the naked eye. We couldn't make it out, but what we did see was a very large deep black triangle with a light at each tip that looked like a star, or in other words 3 stars in a triangle shape, moving slowly NW to SE. It took about 7 minutes for the craft to move out of my sight. I had time to run into the house and grab the video cam with nightshot, but am uncertain if anything showed up on it as I haven't yet viewed the tape. It was difficult to try to acquire it in the viewfinder as it was way up there and I had to keep looking from the camera to acquire it visually and then attempt to get it in the camera frame. I know it wasn't three satellites moving in tandem as stars that it passed over were blocked out from view. My wife could see it at first, but then lost it as she has difficulty with her contacts at night, but is a security officer at the toxic waste facility here and has reported to me that she has seen this object before during night shifts. This is my first siting of this nature.;42.988;-116.0894
