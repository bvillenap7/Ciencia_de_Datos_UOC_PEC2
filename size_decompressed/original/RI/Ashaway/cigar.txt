I turned right into Rt 3 and finally a few minutes later I saw it again. Right before I saw it the second time I drove by a solar power field and a worker was by his truck looking up into the sky. I'm pretty sure he was looking at it. My hubby was driving so he couldn't see it and he was gonna pull over but there was to much traffic.;41.4222;-71.7862
