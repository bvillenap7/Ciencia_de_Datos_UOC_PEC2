Four or five chevron type craft flying at night.;2012-02-21 18:45:00;about 1 minute;Four or five chevron type craft flying at night. While heading South bound on Rt. 95 at the Rhode Island and Connecticut line I noticed two low flying objects.  It was foggy with a light rain and all I could see was three lights in a triangular formation.   At first I thought maybe these were two C 130 Hercules from the Quonset Air Guard.  Then I realized how close they were to each other, I then noticed as I was driving now into Connecticut two or three other crafts making a staggered formation with the first two craft.    I opened my window to try and hear engines and heard non.  However, I was on a highway with typical road noise.  I could not make out any standard aircraft form, from what I could see they were a chevron or triangle shape.   There were lights at all three points, if I recall there was a red strobe at the front point, a green light on the left point, and a white light on the right point.;41.4222;-71.7862
