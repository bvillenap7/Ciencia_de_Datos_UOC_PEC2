At 3AM on Fathers Day of 2018 myself and my friend witnessed a star-shaped UFO travel across the sky over us, after we both declared out loud we wanted to see a UFO.   We both witnessed this star shaped object at the same time, moving faster than a Satellite but not as fast as a comet or shooting star.  When we noticed it, I spoke to it saying Show us something and at that point it began to change colors as it moved, but left no trail.  The other witness at that exact moment saw a white flash in the sky, as well.;41.7439;-71.3179
