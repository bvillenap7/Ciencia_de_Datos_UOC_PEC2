I was looking down and my wife suddendly said Oooo, look at that.  I looked up (looked north and maybe slightly west) and saw a brillant fireball heading nearly straight down.  I could only perceive a slight arc.  While probably not a extra-terrestrial space craft, it was still enough to make my heart skip.  I had never seen a metor during the day - what it must have looked like at night!  I was shocked at how long we could observe the object since most metors last just an instant.;41.7439;-71.3179
