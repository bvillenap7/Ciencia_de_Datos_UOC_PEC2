White cylinder with orange flames hovering at rooftop height.;2013-08-02 22:00:00;30 seconds;White cylinder with orange flames hovering at rooftop height. It was  a very dark night without a moon.  I looked up to admire the bright stars, turned and noticed a white cylinder hovering over a tennis court 100 yards away.  It was upright like a big coffee can with orange flames coming out of the bottom.  It hovered back and forth for a few seconds and moved away and seemed to disappear.  I wish I had time to take a picture, but I was in shock and trying to rationalize that it was some kind of remote control toy.  I decided that it was not a toy since there were obvious flames coming out of the bottom.  I wish someone had seen this with me....I was not drinking, but I am a skeptic about these things...or I should say I was...I can't get the picture and experience out of my mind.;41.4016;-71.6663
