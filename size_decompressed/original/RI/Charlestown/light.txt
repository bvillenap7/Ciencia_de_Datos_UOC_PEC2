Light over submarine base, Groton, CT.;2000-02-28 21:30:00;30 min.;Light over submarine base, Groton, CT. This sighting is submitted by the UFO LAB in Richmond, RI. On the night of Monday Feb. 28, 2000 at approximately 9:30 pm we were called by two of our members.  They had spotted a strange light hovering over some turf fields next to the Chario High School.  We called a friend and the three of us headed for the area of the sighting.  Upon arriving, we spotted the light hovering above the submarine base at Groton,CT. The light was very bright and unchanging.  The light then moved up and down.  It then bounced to the left and bounced back to the right.  The base at Groton, CT is a nuclear submarine base.  We watched it for approximately 5 minutes then it faded and disappeared.;41.4016;-71.6663
Basketball size yellowish light crosses my field of vision near rural road intersecion.;2016-11-05 19:35:00;30 seconds;Basketball size yellowish light crosses my field of vision near rural road intersecion. As I was driving down a dark back road, not far from my home,  I saw a round, yellowish-white light, about the size of a basketball, cross my path, east to west.  The ball of light was about 15 feet in the air as I approached an intersection (4 way stop).  The speed of the object I would guess was about 25mph.  It went beyond my sight to my left.   My former girlfriend told me several years ago about a similar incident regarding an identical object that crossed in front of her field of vision at a rural intersection near the RI/MA border late one night.  That object, she related, was at 4 foot height, then crossed the road to climb over a church steeple, and disappear.   I called the local TV station WJAR the next day to report her sighting and the news station manager acknowledged that three other reports of that object in MA were received by the station.  He seemed unconcerned about it, not surprisingly.  I believe that these 'probes' are more prevalent than is being reported.;41.4016;-71.6663
Light moving at a high rate of speed.;2020-02-24 05:30:00;2-3 minutes;Light moving at a high rate of speed. I was standing outside my office looking at the stars, when a light was moving across the sky at a high rate of speed, to high to be a plane heading south west from the North east.  It slowed down to a complete stop.  It was hard to see it when it changed direction and headed south east at a high rate of speed until I lost sight of it.;41.4016;-71.6663
