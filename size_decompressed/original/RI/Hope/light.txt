Bright red stationary light, low in sky, never moves and inch, then disappears.;2014-10-14 22:30:00;6 minutes;Bright red stationary light, low in sky, never moves and inch, then disappears. Sitting inside at the window I glanced out to see a stationary ball of red light to my southeast. Living on a hill overlooking the valley of West Warwick, I am quite familiar with common lights of the night sky such as stars, planets and many different types of aircrafts. This red light was none of those objects. It never moved the whole 6 or so minutes I was watching it. It was very low in the sky, much lower than any aircraft. It also was not more than a couple of miles away from me in the Southeast sky. The light stayed in place for 6 minutes, then began to move away from me at a very high speed towards the south and disappeared in a matter of seconds. I have lived in this room on top of this hill for 20 years and I have never seen anything like this.;41.7527;-71.5659
