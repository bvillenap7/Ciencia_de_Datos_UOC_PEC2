Flew 50 feet in air, one after another, came back towards us, and then went back into the opposite direction.;2006-10-21 00:00:00;4 seconds;Flew 50 feet in air, one after another, came back towards us, and then went back into the opposite direction. I was walking down the street near the EWG, north kingstown border with my friend late at night. We were walking from another friends house back to his house. It must have been 11pm to 1am. It was a few months ago, i don't remember the date. 3 circles of lights flashed through the sky, extremly fast, and low. About 50 feet in the air. They did not go in a triangle pattern. They flew one after another. Then they came back towards us, as we ran into the woods. Then they went back into the other direction. It was the strangest thing i have ever seen in my entire life. We ran back to my friends house.  Two weeks later the same friend and I were in the same area walking a friend back to her house. My friends ran ahead of me, and i saw the lights by myself. On the way back to our house, both my friend and I saw these lights again, but they only flew over us once.;41.5921;-71.4641
