Two bright yellow/orange lights moving Northwest to Southeast over North Kingstown, RI;2013-03-30 20:20:00;10 minutes;Two bright yellow/orange lights moving Northwest to Southeast over North Kingstown, RI On the evening of March 30, 2013 my wife, brother in law and I were sitting in our backyard.  At approximately 20:20 PM I looked up and noticed a bright yellow / orange light moving from the Northwest to the Southeast.  I noticed it when it was above our location.   The light was very bright, much brighter than any surrounding stars and much brighter than the landing lights on a commercial airliner.  It did not blink, but had a slight flicker.  We also did not hear any sound.   As it passed our location, at about 45 degrees from the horizon, the light began to fade and we could not see it any longer.   Approximately 8 minutes later another object of the same color and brightness passed overhead and followed the same direction as the first. It too faded as it approached the horizon.
