Bright light, sunny afternoon sky, Aug. '89. Stationary for 2 hrs. plus, highly visible, eerie.;1989-08-20 14:00:00;2 1/2 hours;Bright light, sunny afternoon sky, Aug. '89. Stationary for 2 hrs. plus, highly visible, eerie. This is in response to a query 1/18/05 about a brightflashlite type light in the sky, which remained for duration of two hours. This occured in Aug.1989, about the 20th+ or -.  Was with a disabled friend in an East-facing enclosed porch with a very large glass wall/ window.  Bright sunlight.  A very bright occasionally flashing object suddenly appeared in the Southeast at about 70 degrees above the horizon-- it was larger than a dot-- about the size of a pea held at arm's length.  It remained clearly there for about 2 1/2 hours, and was stationary.  It brightened and dimmed periodically, then suddenly blinked out.  Never saw it again.  Because of the date, and the memorable sighting of the object/light-- when I read the GA report-- I found a remarkable connection/coincidence.;41.5921;-71.4641
blurry bar of light in western sky ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch from Cape Canaveral.  PD));2004-08-31 21:00:00;5 minutes;blurry bar of light in western sky In Rhode Island at about 9pm EST on 8/31/2004, we saw a horizontal bar of white light in the western sky, just over the treeline. Initially, the bar was bright with two brighter areas at each end and the light was compact.  As it slowly and steadily moved upward toward the eastern sky, it dissipated into a fainter cloud til it was no longer visible (~30 degrees above the western sky). The night was clear with many stars visible. No sound was heard.  Another description I found on the net matched what we saw. That description (at http://www.fftimes.com/index.php/7/2004-08-27/18127/554) I've patsted below  in the night sky over southern maine 8/31/04 2004-08-31 22:35:38  anyone else see something wild tonight (at first like a glowing bar with a brighter orb-like forms at each end, then morphing into an amoeba-like form as it moved eastward) in the southern maine sky to the west low over the horizon and moving slowly toward the east before dissipating?

I saw this same object with a friend driving in north smithfield a different part of the state at the exact same hours at 1:00 AM and it's yhe second time within 4 months seen by someone else other then me which is the weird part that freaks me out. Only seems to be seen while driving home because I go to my friends house every weekend to watch sports and have to drive home at 1 am. Object fazes into a ball of light around 8 or stories above the highway and flies at a stalkish slightly faster speed then the car and after 5 seconds fazes out of visibility and disapears. Goes in a really odd looking super straight line that looks unreal. No other concerning observations about the object rather then it keeps appearing around the state at a similar height around 1 am only when almost no one is on the roads.;41.5921;-71.4641
