I was about to go to bed around midnight, when I heard what sounded like a low flying jet -- which prompted me to look out the front window of our apartment... when I looked up, to the right, very high in the sky, I could see lights... I thought, oh there's the jet... as I kept watching, I noticed it really wasn't moving... just kind of hovering, and there were colored lights pulsating around it, green, red and white. I grabbed my camera, but the pictures were coming out blurry. I got the video camera, and took some footage with that, hoping we can enhance it later on the computer. I also grabbed my camera again, and took a short video with that too. I watched this thing just hang there in the sky, pulsating, for over 40 minutes... around 12:50AM there was cloud cover and I could no longer see whatever this was. Also, as an added twist to this story, my ten year old Son had told me, and my Husband that he kept seeing a flashing light out side. He seen this flashing light out side the same room I seen my sighting from later that night. Our Son told us this at about 10PM just as my Husband was about to leave for work. We have reviewed the video footage, and indeed there is three different colors of light at this one point in the sky.;41.3709;-71.8141
