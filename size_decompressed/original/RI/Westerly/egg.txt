Dark cloud followed by 5-6 chrome egg shaped crafts;2014-07-07 13:00:00;30-45 seconds;Dark cloud followed by 5-6 chrome egg shaped crafts My wife and I were out on are boat enjoying a wonderful afternoon and she suddenly saw a dark spot in the sky just above the horizon and when I looked at what appeared to be a dark cloud I noticed 5-6 shiny chrome egg shaped objects at a height about 50% lower than what a commercial aircraft would be flying at,  I worked hands on with airplanes for 7 years, these were not planes, balloon,skydivers ex.... The objects hovered perfectly still, I stopped my boat and I could not believe what I seeing, I saw one of these crafts make a maneuver  in a hook type move half way around the other objects at a speed that no man made craft could of possibly do, the objects remained absolutely still for another few seconds then they all started moving very very slow and suddenly dissapeared, the dark cloud was still present but with in mins was totally faded and gone the cloud was not black but almost like a dark storm cloud,;41.3709;-71.8141
