I was doing some light cleaning around my house and reached under the sink for dusting supplies.  At this point I heard a helicopter passing very low over my house. I knelt down in front of the window and looked up as an army type chopper was indeed in veiw,    I watched for only a few second before a second object passed (east) above the helicopter.  It inter my sight from a direction over my house and as crossed the path of the helicopter it switched direction (to north) and was lost behind a grouping of trees.  The object as I was looking up and at an angle was an unmistakable triangle.  It appeared black in color with a flashing light at the point facing the rear.  It had other lights along the bottom and sides but they were not as bright.  There was no sound apart from the noise of the chopper that I could detect.;41.3709;-71.8141

After about an hour, I happened to look up and saw a craft. It had lights, but they weren't flashing. It moved at relatively slow pace. Well this was going on, a friend came out of the house from using the bathroom. I pointing to him the craft. I asked if he noticed any lights blinking or flashing. He didn't. Then, the craft just disappeared. Vanished. About 2 minutes later and airplane with red flashing lights flew by.;41.3709;-71.8141
