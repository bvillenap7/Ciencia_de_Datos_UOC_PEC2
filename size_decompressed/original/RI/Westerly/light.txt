Fast light being followed by helicopter, darting all over the place.;2020-04-16 20:55:00;7 minutes;Fast light being followed by helicopter, darting all over the place. Saw an incredibly bright light moving fast and all over the place with a helicopter following its every move. Sitting near Watch Hill this thing started coming toward us, with the heli following, and then completely darted into the other direction faster than any craft I've seen. Clearly the helicopter was following it.  They were not search helicopters, and only one was a familiar looking light/aircraft.  Clearly officials noticed it too.  I sure doubt we'll every hear anything about it, but it was bizarre as can be.;41.3709;-71.8141
