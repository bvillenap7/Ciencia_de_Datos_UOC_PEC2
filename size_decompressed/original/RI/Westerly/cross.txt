I was sitting in my living room and I looked out my window and saw a cross-looking UFO with rainbow lights and the craft itself was black and small at least from my distance.  I saw it again a block away and have only seen it at night.  I believe that the possible aliens that are inside that thing know who I am because about four months ago I took a vacation to Florida and saw it again in the air at night each sighting looked the same.  And just 3 or 4 weeks ago I was sitting in my chair outside at dawn and when it turned dark I saw something moving in the sky and it looked exactly like a star and wasn’t a plane which is what I thought it was at first but this one had the same lights as a star and was identical to a star but didn’t have rainbow lights.  The first UFO that I had mentioned might have been a drone but I don’t think so since it followed me to Florida and also to a block away from my house.  I just looked at the pic/vid of mine that I remember catching it on camera in and right where it was was nothing it was like the aliens erased themselves from the photo/pic I think the aliens know me.;41.3709;-71.8141
