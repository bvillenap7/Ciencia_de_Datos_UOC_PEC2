I was looking out the window at 12:45 when I saw a plane flying in the direction from north to south at a high altitude.  I then noticed a small circular object flying along side it.  The circular object slowed down to a speed much slower then the plane and disappeared behind the clouds.  At this point the plane flew over head, and I went outside for a closer look.  About 5 minutes passed and I then noticed the same object emerged from the clouds, stayed at the high altitude and started to fly south west at what looked like at a slow speed.  I could see the object better when it was directly over my house because it was heading closer to the sun.  The object looked like it was rotating because every time it rotated there was a brief reflection.  The Object stayed at a slow pace for 5 more minutes heading south west until it was no longer visible.;41.3709;-71.8141
