craft blending in with the stars,  visits Rhode Island;2007-11-25 21:00:00;4;craft blending in with the stars,  visits Rhode Island while house sitting for a friend, I was on the porch at night observing the sky, with very little light pollution, the night sky is very clear.  It was a cold night with no cloud cover.  I observed a star like object come over the horizon (thought to be an airplane) traveling in a Northerly direction, except it never had any blinking lights (navigation lights), then it just stopped in the sky, and if you had not seen it move  into position, one could easily assume it was just another star in the sky.  Now thinking it was maybe a helicopter (no sound though) it just stayed in that position for at least an hour, then it would change it's position in very straight lines, then stop at intervals of 15 to 20 minutes, sometimes covering large distances.  Using a extremely bright LED flashlight, *in a joking manner* I tried to flash it with a morse code like pattern, and to my surprise it appeared to move no longer in straight lines but curved lines at a higher rate of speed.  then stopping to hold a position.  It appeared at this time to change it's shine pattern maybe changing the color of the light and even shape.  Eventually it went back to the star appearance held position, and eventually moved off in a NW direction in a slow straight line until out of view.  this all took place between 9pm and 1am.  In my personal opinion this behaved like no aircraft that I am aware of, as to what it actually was... your guess is as good as mine.
