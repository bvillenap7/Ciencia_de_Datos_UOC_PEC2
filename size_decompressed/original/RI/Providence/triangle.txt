Fleeting triangular object following a meteor path;2011-09-12 21:30:00;1 second;Fleeting triangular object following a meteor path My wife and I were walking our dog in the late evening.  We had just sat down on a park bench behind a building when I saw a falling star (meteor) fall quite brightly, appearing between the building and a tree line to our  left.  I asked my wife if she saw the meteor but she was looking in another direction.  Five seconds after that I saw what appeared to be three diffused light-colored spots (very close together) flying in the exact course the meteor had taken.  This only lasted a second, again my wife did not see this new thing.  While it might have been a bird (or birds) I am curious about the shape and manner in which it flew, but mostly the direction -- right behind the ‘falling star’.  It seemed to have been at a greater distance than if it had been a bird, possibly a large object of some kind.  This happened near the Providence/Pawtucket line: Rhode Island.

Objects flying over Providence, RI.;2014-06-06 23:00:00;3-4 minutes;Objects flying over Providence RI My finace and I went out to smoke a last cigarette for the night on our front porch.  While finishing up I looked up and saw a huge white glowing semi transparent rounded triangle fly at above tree level.  The object was below planes' levels as there were two up high in the sky at the time I noticed.   I jumped up and tried to convince my fiance to look up.  He refused and told me that I looked nuts!   I saw another smaller looking traingle follow after the object and was proceded by two orange/red smaller objects.  At this time my fiance saw the last one and made me go inside.  The first one was incredibly fast and the others were slower.   This is the first time i have ever saw or reported anything like this.  I reported this only because I googled this and found out that everyone else saw it too!   All I can say is, What the hell is going on?;41.8257073878628;-71.4163445910288
