Colorful lights seen over Providence/Warwick-did you see this?  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect Venus.  PD));2004-09-07 04:45:00;18+minutes;Colorful lights seen over Providence/Warwick-did you see this? I feel like a crazy doing this, but I want to know if anyone else saw this.  I woke up to nurse my baby (4:30am)and was looking out the window.  I saw some colorful and bright lights flashing, thought it was a plane, but they didn't move.  So, I went and got my glasses since I thought maybe it was a planet and wanted a better view, but it was too bright and close.  Got my husband up who is the worlds biggest skeptic and he thought it wasn't a plane or planet.  It sat there for quite some time and slowly started to move away.  Did anyone else see this?

Rhode Island, Providence, Nantucket, 19th January - formation flying craft of ther sky;2009-01-19 14:21:00;6 minutes 20 seconds;Rhode Island, Providence, Nantucket, 19th January - formation flying craft of ther sky We were driving home from a meeting of our local sports club when 4 bright lights passed in front of us, above us, following the path of the highway.  At first we thought they were aircraft but then we realised there was no noise and they seemed to be dancing around each other.  Then one of them suddenly changed direction instantly and flew off behind the tree line.  The others stopped, wiggled a bit in the air and then disappeared as if covered by cloud.  Birds looked quite confused.;41.8257073878628;-71.4163445910288
8 disc shaped crafts w/4 or 5 orange lights...they made no noise whatsoever and they should have if they were produced on this planet.;2015-07-04 21:00:00;5-7 minutes;8 disc shaped crafts w/4 or 5 orange lights...they made no noise whatsoever and they should have if they were produced on this planet. I happen to look out my front door at all the colored fireworks in the air and noticed at first 5 round shaped disc shaped crafts w/4 or 5 orange lights at the bottom of same.  They made no noise at all and they weren't that far, whereas I wouldn't hear the noise of a normal type craft.   The formation was not totally straight.  Five of them stopped for approx. 30 seconds and seemed to be observing the fireworks, then they continued to proceed south, they came from the north.  They were not going at a high rate of speed either.  They were at approx. 1 mile apart from each other.   Then as they seemed to disappear into the clouds another one showed up and then two more.  All crafts seemed to disappear into the cloudly sky.   I waited to see if they would reappear for quite a while, but they did not.  They weren't very far in the sky, no where near what a plane would be, yet not one noise was heard even when the fireworks stopped you still couldn't hear a thing.  They also seemed to have a top to the disc shape...it was rounded.  I'm unsure if I was the only one who saw these crafts but I think folks were more interested in the various colors in the sky which the crafts also seemed intereted in too.;41.8257073878628;-71.4163445910288
