Red circular object moving quickly, then stops and hovers over Providence, RI, changes colors and then disappears.;2016-08-16 05:30:00;10 minute;Red circular object moving quickly, then stops and hovers over Providence, RI, changes colors and then disappears. Around 5:30 this morning, my husband was out in the back yard with our dog, when he began to shout for me to come outside quickly. I worried something was wrong, so I immediately ran outside, as he pointed to the sky.   About a mile away I saw a very prominent red circle or orb like craft.  There could have been a haze around it but unsure if it was my eyes or not.  The orb was definitive and red though.  I observed it and watched it  in the sky as it was hovering.   Then, it very quickly zinged to the right and stopped again.  It turned from red to white, then back to red.  What I couldn't believe was the way it flew to the side and stopped immediately, not a gradual stop or eased stop, but a full on stop, like it hit a barrier and how fast it was moving.   It hovered a minute, then zinged left stopped, and it appeared to gain some elevation as it slowly proceeded to fly to the right and out of view for a few seconds, when I caught a glimpse of it through the houses.   I then observed it zing up into the sky so fast, I couldn't believe it, and it was gone.   I am a well educated professional and I am telling you there is nothing I have ever seen or heard of that:  1.  Is as precise in stopping as that craft was, it defied physics  2. Could move that fast, and still maintain such control and 3.  Could maneuver so quietly, no visible propellers or exterior engines were visible and without any vapor trail or exhaust.   It was scary and intriguing at the same time.  I have no doubt what I saw was not from here.;41.8257073878628;-71.4163445910288
Red orb moving quickly, then stops multiple times over Providence, RI.;2016-08-16 05:30:00;5 minutes;Red orb moving quickly, then stops multiple times over Providence, RI. At 5:30 AM this morning, I was in my garden with my dog, when I looked up to see a bright red orb moving at great speed. It came to a quick stop, hovered and stayed in the same spot.  It looked to be maybe a mile away but was very distinct in shape and no gas trail or anything surrounding it or following it when it moved. I was unsure what I was witnessing, so I shouted out to my wife to come outside. We then saw the orb move in a straight line to the left,it was moving not as fast as when it first came into view,it then moved quickly to the right,then changed from a bright red glow to a bright white glow then back to red. It then moved left again,and then right,it continued moving right, hovered and then continued as it went out of view. I know some very smart women, and my wife is right up with the best of them. She is a professional lady who has been in high position within her company for several years. When she told me that she had never seen anything move like that in her life, I knew I wasn't crazy!  I myself have never seen anything move as fast,and then stop so quickly in my life. It made no noise whatsoever,but the thing that amazed me is the immediate stopping and acceleration it did.  From a stand still, just hovering, to zipping across in one direction then stopping like it hit a wall, then zipping back in the other direction, multiple times, is impossible to believe. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he seemed to us to be quite eloquent and sober-minded.  We suspect he is an excellent witness.  We have requested that his wife submit a second report, as well.  PD));41.8257073878628;-71.4163445910288

November 29th 2020 9:50pm  I changed our names in my report for privacies sake  	I was laying in bed after walking my girlfriend to her;2020-11-29 21:51:00;2 minutes;November 29th 2020 9:50pm  I changed our names in my report for privacies sake  	I was laying in bed after walking my girlfriend to her car. Shortly after, I get a call from her. She says, “Shay, there’s something really weird in the sky, it’s bright and glowing orange”. I responded at first by saying Jupiter is visible from earth right now and maybe that’s it. She says no it’s moving! I believed her but asked her to take a video so she could send it to me. She asked I go look out my front room window in my apartment to look for it. I did. What I saw was unlike anything I have ever seen. I called her back. 	Two big round orbs glowing orange. Just floating over federal hill district of Providence, RI. If I had to guess the objects were about 3 or 4 times the size of a normal air plane you see in the sky everyday. At this point, I’m in a bit of shock. For about a minute I’m watching these things get closer to my apartment still on the phone with my girlfriend Lyla trying to make out what these things are. Still not able to make them out I hang up the phone to go outside and record. The video I sent is from the street my back door is on. 	These things continued to fly/float over my apartment towards I-95n and the mall. Thirty seconds into recording, one of the glowing orbs starts to dim like a controlled light switch in your house. The other object does the same about 2 seconds after. They both dimmed to the point they became invisible in the dark night sky. I then went down the street to the closest patch of grass to throw some in the air to check wind direction. The wind was blowing southwest and these UFO’s were headed northeast. This made me think it can’t be balloons of some sort. The way it was moving seemed like it was propelled by something. Both crafts moved at the same exact speed and in synchrony. I can’t explain what I saw. I just know I’ve never seen anything like it.;41.8257073878628;-71.4163445910288
