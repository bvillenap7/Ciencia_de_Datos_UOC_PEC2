I ran across information that seems to explain the beams.  ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));2009-09-19 19:50:00;20 seconds;how to retract a report?  (I just made it with the same information above).   After doing more research (I had already spent a couple of hours doing that before making this report) I ran across information that seems to explain the beams: a NASA launch at around the same time, with sightings up and down the east coast.

The object was extremely close to my car when driving and traveled at a high rate of speed when it was not idle.;2011-11-26 09:00:00;1-2 hours;the object was extremely close to my car when driving and traveled at a high rate of speed when it was not idle. i was driving on the highway and saw this object floating. it was a bright light that seemed to just stay there for about a half hour. i became fixed on it because i knew it was not a plane because it did not move, and not a helicopter because it did not move at all. it just hovered there. all the sudden it was right above my car i looked from the bottom at it and it looked like the shape of a plane. then my girlfriend in the passenger seat looked up when i was trying to drive and it was a disc shape she said. about 3 minutes later it was miles away where i could not see its shape anymore. then it came close again and started to turn on its side and fly away i said come back because i wanted to look at it and it flew at my car at an incredibly high speed and then vanished. i did not see this but my girlfriend was hysterical and scared because it came in our direction i have pictures and would like to;41.8257073878628;-71.4163445910288
Multiple reflective objects high in the sky.;2015-06-05 13:00:00;5 minutes;Multiple reflective objects high in the sky. Looked to be 15 to 20 objects reflecting light very high in the sky.  They reflected light like an airplane but there looked to be too many to be airplanes.   I took video that shows the flickers in the sky.   I do not know if anyone else saw this.

Extremely fast (hypersonic+) aircraft (UFO) captured on Live TV over Providence, RI....Please Help me ID this thing.;2016-09-26 23:26:00;3 seconds;Extremely Fast (Hypersonic+) aircraft (UFO) captured on Live TV over Providence, RI....Please Help me ID this thing. At exactly 11:22:16pm, while I was watching WPRI 12 channel news they cut to a live view facing the cameras East towards the Biltmore and Westin Hotels.  At this time some type of object coming from the North and heading South was flying past at a fairly low altitude but was going at what appears to me as an extremely fast (beyond Hypersonic speeds).  I needed to slow it down and watch it over again (which I did about 20+ times) at about 1/6 of the normal speed and pausing at different times.  I noticed at this 1/6 speed that it was on camera for less than 2-3 seconds total which indicated to me that its speed was unbelievably fast.  Upon watching it over and over again, at different speeds, different time frames etc, it appears to be as best I could make out some type of aircraft (of Unknown origin).  It honestly could have been some type of fighter jet at hypersonic speeds....but why so low? I tried to DVR this and my DVR said it was having difficulties at! this time. (&lt--Im not saying there is some conspiracy I am only indicating to you why I couldn't record and save this event).  I would ask for help in getting a copy of this from WPRI channel 12 news of this live broadcast, re-analyzing it, and then possibly contacting TF Greene Airport officially to see if they have record of what, if any, aircraft was flying through there. Unfortunately, yet very awkwardly, is the fact that this airport is approximately 10-15 miles from providence and in the same direction of this probable aircraft, however I do know for a fact that given its speed it was NOT coming in for a landing and it was definitely NOT some plane taking off as I have seen 100's of planes do both of these and this aircraft was flying at extremely High rate of speed that I can't even explain in words.  It almost looks like a streak across the sky like a meteor, but it was not at all bright like one, it didn't fizzle out like a meteor and it was clo! se by....like right over the city it appears.  The trajectory (! i.e. ang le) of this UFO is completely inconsistent with a meteor also.  I hope you don't think this is a joke, or just some crazy red neck farmer who had been drinking too muchâ€¦   I am a highly educated, liberal college professor and Registered Nurse from the Northeast who is 100% sober and yet dumbfounded as to what this could be/is.  Please help me if you can.  Thanks;41.8257073878628;-71.4163445910288
