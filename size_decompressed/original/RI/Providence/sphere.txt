I was walking the dog through the woods when all of the sudden I saw 3 sphere like shapes floating about 10 yds in front of me.   Then they spiraled upward to the sky and dashed out opposite of each other and disapeared from sight.

UFO Stuck within a Storm Cloud;2013-07-23 17:40:00;Unknown;UFO Stuck within a Storm Cloud I'm not sure if what I saw was an actual UFO, but I was able to snap a picture of it with my Iphone.   The object was inside a storm cloud but if you look at the picture there are white dots around it (it wasn't raining).  The color appears to blend in with the color of the storm cloud which is grey   Please see the photo I am submitting if you follow the beam of light up to the cloud you will see to the right of it the object I am referring.   I'd love to know if what I saw is in fact a UFO.;41.8257073878628;-71.4163445910288
Large, red and spherical object hiding behind the moon at night.;2014-03-18 23:00:00;Unknown, seemed to stay;Large, red and spherical object hiding behind the moon at night. When traveling across Providence I noticed a large, spherical and red object behind the moon.  I looked at many times in different locations and it was still there.  Seems to be a quarter to a half of the size of the moon.   Had other people look at it and noticed the object.  It wasn't far out, the outside of the object was seen.  The red object seemed to be hiding, and isn't obvious in plain sight.  The time I observed this was around 30 minutes.  The object seemed to be imobile at the time of viewing.   There might of been a small haze at the outline.   I searched sites about astronomy and astronomical calendars but found nothing like this.;41.8257073878628;-71.4163445910288
