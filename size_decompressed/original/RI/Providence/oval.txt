3 illuminated oval objects spotted flying closely together.;2008-10-04 23:15:00;Approximately 1 minute;3 illuminated oval objects spotted flying closely together. My boyfriend and I were at the Fleet Skating Center in Providence, RI, observing a chalk drawing art exhibit that was held earlier on. It was a perfectly clear nite, the stars were out and there were only a few clouds, if any. I happened to look up, and directly in my path of vision I saw 3 oval lights flying closely together. I alerted my boyfriend, who also observed the objects. I proceeded to point and shout, but others around us did not bother to look. The objects were visible for approximately a minute, and then disappeared into the nite.;41.8257073878628;-71.4163445910288
