I was driving down North Main Street in Providence towards downtown.  It was sunset so  the airplanes over the city had their lights on which attracted my attention to the sky.  All of the sudden I saw a silver diagonal line much like a backslash (\) zoom across the sky right over the city towards college hill.  It was moving faster than anything I had ever seen and as soon as I realized what was going on, it disappeared.;41.8257073878628;-71.4163445910288
Star slides to left in sky, then Disappears;2010-05-14 04:30:00;2 seconds;Star slides to left in sky, then Disappears I know this may be a bit late to report, but I just found this site. I apologies for my bad timing. On Friday, May 14th 2010, around 4:30 am., I saw something quite curious. I am a cab driver and I tend to sit at the same spot early in the morning.  For some time I had been watching what I thought was Venus, rising in the east.  I was informed later that it was probably Jupiter. Anyhow, being the star gazer I am, I have watched this same star, planet, for quite awhile. What made this morning different was the fact that while I was watching it definitely slid approximately 4 inches in my view to the left and then just vanished. It was a clear morning, no clouds.  I waited for it to reappear but it never did in that spot.  10 minutes later or so though, if it is the same star, it did reappear way to the right and a lot higher in the sky. It happened way to fast to capture on video.  Not to mention I just wasn't expecting it. A few weeks later I attempted to make a video of what I saw.  Have link if needed.;41.8257073878628;-71.4163445910288

I tried to find it by walking to other side of house, but could not see it.  As i got back onto porch and was looking up higher into the sky, a white shooting star type of light streaked at a low altitude and then just completely vanished.  There were no clouds in that area at that time.  There was no noises emitted by either object.;41.8257073878628;-71.4163445910288

One craft flew straight up and stayed still in that position for about 3 minutes, before resuming to fly.   After a few minutes of crafts flying around, what appeared to be a military aircraft flew between the other 4 crafts.  My attention was taken away for about a minute, and when I looked back up they were all gone.;41.8257073878628;-71.4163445910288
