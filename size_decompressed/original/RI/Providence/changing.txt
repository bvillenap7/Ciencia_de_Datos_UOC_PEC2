A jet went overhead and was turning slightly.  I happened to be looking up at this time and after it went by,  I noticed a small white object in the sky.  I watched for awhile and it didn't disappear or fall.  I grabbed binoculars. The object appeared to be solid white.  It changed shape a few times but was mostly tear drop shaped.;41.8257073878628;-71.4163445910288
