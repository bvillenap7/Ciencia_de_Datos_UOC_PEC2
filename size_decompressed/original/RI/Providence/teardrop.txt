It was being chased by a plane!;2006-01-13 02:20:00;Early Morning;It was being chased by a plane! This object was a sort of tear drop, a pewter color that was shining into my eyes. I had just gotten really wasted and had had an orgy so that is why i had two other people watching. The craft was moving east toward the rising sun and it looked like it was running away from a plane.;41.8257073878628;-71.4163445910288
UFO seen floating over providence, RI;2009-06-08 03:00:00;7 minutes;UFO seen floating over providence, RI I was looking up into the sky and i noticed this really bright object. I knew it wasn't a star because there wasn't any stars out and it was too cloudy.  I let my other two friends know what i was seeing. one of them even suggested that it was an object flying by the earths surface. but it wasn't moving.  it was shaped like a teardrop. after looking at it for 6 minutes it made a huge flash and flew out too quick to even see it. the flash was like a greenish color.;41.8257073878628;-71.4163445910288
Around 6 am I saw something in the sky  that looked like a silver teardrop.;2012-11-19 18:00:00;4-9 minutes;Around 6 am I saw something in the sky  that looked like a silver teardrop. While walking to the bus stop around around 6 am i happen to look up at the sky when i saw something that looked like a silver teardrop, very far up in the sky going down, it caught my attention because it didnt look like a plane flying forward, this was actually flying down, as if it was being dropped.  As it was going down it changed color from silver to black.  It became a dot and after about 2 mins it disappeared.  I ended up missing the bus, i didn't want to take my eyes off of it.  Very weird experience. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));41.8257073878628;-71.4163445910288
