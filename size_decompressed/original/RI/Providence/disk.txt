saucer with red and blue lights over providence, RI;2009-10-01 20:00:00;5 minutes;saucer with red and blue lights over providence, RI I saw a saucer shape moving slowly through the sky. At first I thought it was an airplane but than I compared it to another plane off in the distance and they just weren’t the same. This ship was moving smoothly and the lights on it were different. It had two red lights on the outside and blue lights coming from the inside. It looked like a shadow of a disk against the dark sky. I’ve never seen anything like this before.;41.8257073878628;-71.4163445910288
