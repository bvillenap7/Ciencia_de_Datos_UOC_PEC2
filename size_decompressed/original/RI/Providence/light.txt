Elongated yellowish bar of light which pulsated as it travelled;2007-11-06 18:00:00;one minute;Elongated yellowish bar of light which pulsated as it travelled In slightly overcast sky, sitting in my car waiting for my wife to come out of the grocery store -- observed slowly pulsating yellowish elongated light -- like a thin grain of rice at arms length.   I thought it was an airplane at first as it was traveling along the flight paths of other airplanes which I was observing out of boredom (roughly south to north) as if traveling along with them towards Boston (but it was at that time alone in the sky).  However the dim nature of the light-bar, and that it brightened and darkened slowly, without going on or off like typical airplane made me curious.  It reminded me of the behavior of a satellite, but the overcast sky would make that impossible. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
