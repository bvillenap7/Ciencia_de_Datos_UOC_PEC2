((HOAX??  STUDENT REPORT))  Cranston ri UFO sighting in sports field at Cranston West High School.;2000-06-25 02:25:00;few minutes;Cranston ri UFO sighting in sports field at Cranston West High School It was 2:25am ish and I was driving down phenix ave, I saw lights out of the right corner of my eye.  The lights were coming from ether the football field of Cranston West High School or the baseball field. It's hard to remember some parts of the sighting for some reason.  I slowed my car down a bit but didn't stop moving.  Just as my neck reached its turning point in toughs last few seconds of view I noticed it lift slowly off the ground and movie in the direction I was driving.  I took the first right turn I could which was the parking lot of Western Hills School and drove as fast as I could to try and get another glimpse of this thing.  As I got to the back of the school where the road goes over the small river in-between the two foresty areas, what ever it was it flew right over me...  I tried to see it better but my car has a small sun roof so it was hard to see.  Plus it moved fairly quickly out from behind the trees on my right, over the road and then over the trees on my left.  I continued to drive forward but didn't see it again.   As I got home (my home is right down the road) I heard the sound of jets fly by.  All I could think was, Did that just happen?   As a side note, I can't really describe the thing I saw because it happened so fast and my memory of the ship or what ever it was is a bit foggy.  But what I do remember is that it was black, like mat black. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous provides no contact information.

Loud noise like a jet engine that went off and on for an hour making strange sounds.;2004-01-20 14:30:00;1 hour;Loud noise like a jet engine that went off and on for an hour making strange sounds. Me and my brother heard a loud sound like a jet that was pulsing its engines. we live in the middle of a large neighborhood with the closest airport 2 cities away. The sound would stop and begin again off and on for about an hour, sometimes it would make a screaching noise and return back to a rumble. It was extreamly loud and unexplained. there was no events or anything in the area that would make this type of sound. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD)) ((NOTE FROM READER/UNCONFIRMED)) This is an explination in regaurds to the reports filed on 8/11/04 and 11/8/05 in cranston RI.  The jet sounds heard were comming from the Florida Power and Lighting Power Plant located on Shun Pike in Johnston RI.  On both nights posted the power plant experienced a large build up of steam pressure that had to be vented off. As steam passes through the relief valves it creates a loud jet engine like sound that can be heard many miles away. ((END NOTE));41.7692307692308;-71.4739009615386
