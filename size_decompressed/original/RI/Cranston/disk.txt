April 23, 2009  Approximately 7:10 PM Cranston, Rhode Island Area I was traveling South on New London Avenue, just passing the Army National Guard headquarters and the Shaw's Supermarket plaza.  My seven year old was riding with me when he pointed to a tall water tower that he thought was interesting to our left (Looking East).  The sun was just setting off in West.  My son looked in another direction and I happened to glance at the tower which was inside the states prison campus.  I noticed just above it in the sky near the tower and there were two shiny silver objects like what you see on TV (saucer shaped) shiny silver.  At first I thought it was planes because TF Green is nearby, but then I looked back at the road (because I was driving) for a second.  I turned back to my left (looking South Eastward) and the the two objects which were diagonal from each other jolted upward just a bit and shrunk out of sight vanishing into the blue sky.  It was a clear section of the sky too.  So there was really no clouds to hide behind.   They jolted upwards and vanished.  I watched this with my own two eyes.  I don't buy into much of this UFO nonsense, but after witnessing this bizarre account, I have changed my position on the matter.;41.7692307692308;-71.4739009615386
