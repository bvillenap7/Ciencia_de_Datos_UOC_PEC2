Bright spheres forming huge triangle.;2012-06-14 23:00:00;15 minutes;Bright spheres forming huge triangle I was with a friend driving near Narragansett Blvd and turned onto a street which faced the cove near the RI yacht club and was startled by 6 bright round fireballs in the sky that were in a huge triangle formation.   I stopped the car and got out.  As we watched the objects broke the triangle formation and proceeded to form a straight line across the sky traveling in unison with each other to the west.  After that the object in the front of the line gave a couple of bright pulses and would fade out only to be replaced by another one in the back of the line. This occured several times.   My friend who was with me said that the objects weren't far away and I should drive to get closer(I couldn't judge their distance).   We got into the car and proceeded an eighth of a mile up the boulevard and he was right, they wre right above us.  We got out of the car and looked directly up and there they were silently floating over us about 1000 feet up. They were perfect spheres with a bright gold center that was like a welding arc.  The light didn't travel outside of the sphere.  As they flashed out one by one I realized they were still there, only they were now dimly lit specks of light.   They all turned direction and were heading back over the port of Providence.  I'm reporting this now because I saw the report of another person about the same thing on that night in the same area.  He mustve just caught the tail end of it.   I'm so glad I found this sight, I feel relieved and validated.;41.7692307692308;-71.4739009615386
3 spheres in Cranston, RI.;2012-11-05 09:40:00;1 minute;3 spheres in Cranston RI In the morning of 5 November 2012 I saw two spheres traveling towards the west at high altitude.  They were bright and disappeared in the distance.  The sighting last less than a minute. It was definitely not a plane or helicopter was not similar to any known aircraft.  I saw the third one it was a bright sphere and some kind of light brown smoke wrapped it and disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

orange spheres moving side by side over rhode island;2019-03-16 20:50:00;10 seconds;orange spheres moving side by side over rhode island On 3/16/19 I was bringing in a load of firewood.  I thought I saw a meteor, when I looked up, there were 2 round lights side by side coming out of the south west sky.  Moving much slower then a meteor, and faster then a plane.  They were a dull orange color with a haze around them, which was odd because the night sky was clear and bright.  The 2 lights moved at the same speed and same direction, but slightly changed distance from each other.  They traveled straight and then turned 90 degrees to the north east, and a few seconds later were gone.  They made no noise, and the light was constant, not blinking like airplanes. I saw them for about 10 seconds.;41.7692307692308;-71.4739009615386
