Pulsating white, red, geen light in the Western Sky of Rhode Island.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of star.  PD));2010-07-27 00:15:00;20 minutes;Pulsating white, red, geen light in the Western Sky of Rhode Island I Noticed a bright pulsating star-like object in the West about 25 â€“ 30 degrees above the horizon at around Midnight (morning of July 27th, 2010).  To the naked eye, it was about the size and brightness of Jupiter, slightly less.  My attention had been kept because this star had a pulsating twinkle to it, where it would twinkle white, red and green colors while keeping a white color to it.  The twinkling was rather fast, not a slow changing in colors, but pulsating.  The object was always stationary and did not move.  The first 10 minutes I looked at it with my naked eye.  I then went in the house and looked at it again for 10 more minutes with 8 X 21 binoculars, no change in size but still had the same pulsation to it.  I then went inside and spent 10 minutes looking at online star maps and satellite tracking maps on Nasa.gov, went back outside and it was gone.  I never saw how it disappeared.  I will attempt to look again in the sky tonight at the same tim! e to see if it appears again. ((ADDENDUM TO REPORT FROM WITNESS)) Disregard last entry Followup on previous entry from day before.  I have realized that this is nothing but a star that was pulsating different colors due to pollution and it moving to a lower part of the horizon where there is more pollution.   The object didn't really disappear tonight, just became less bright...  Please Disregard.  Thanks! ((END ADDENDUM));41.7692307692308;-71.4739009615386

Its wo;2019-01-26 15:58:00;1 minute;Heading towards work in a Uber, i silently sat in the backseat of the car.  I notice a plane which seems low but nothing alarming.  Its worth mentioning in this part of Cranston it is one of the highest points in the entire state also has VERY heavy air traffic.  Now for what ever reason this plane keeps my attention, ill take it to my grave that this damn.  Thing looked like it wasnt moving?  And it most certainly WAS-NOT.  this huge plane which looked like a typical common large boeing was seeminly STUCK completely still in the sky!  I was heading north and the plane seemed to be heading south.  I could make out the side of the plane and the belly.  It was a large purple plane with a yellow stripe going down the middle, towards the end of the stripe it turned red and ends at a sharp point, i do not remember any writing or logos as my brain was melting.  I noticed my breathing was picking up and i found my self on my knees looking out the back window (i always sit in the rear passenger seat in ubers) im a grown man who had a grown man driving me, im sure i came off odd because the man eventually noticed me and awkwardly asked lots of good sights round here huh?... I didnt even reply as i couldn't wrap my mind around what i had just saw. I remember i desperately wanted to scream LOOK LOOK! or ask him to pull over but while im wathcing this i couldnt get anything out.  It may have been becaude this man was a stranger and i didnt wanna look insane or because i was in shock and or amazement. For those in the area the whole thing happened above the Dennys next to garden city.  The whole thing was seemingly harmless but ive been replaying it in my head over and over, i have googled it and some people have claimed to have captured exactly what i described on camera and its very eerie.  Its also propably unrelated but one thing i have found very odd is that ever since that day i have been having some very out of the ordinary good luck.!  Very minor things like finding 20 bucks, being gifted things, finding things, small coincidences that usually wouldn't go my way.  The weather was fine, nothing to note.  Very eerie and mind blowing, i WISH i could go back to that moment;41.7692307692308;-71.4739009615386
Object appears, moves, and disappears.;2019-07-15 00:45:00;3 to 5 secs;Object appears, moves, and disappears. I let my dog out the backyard.  While waiting for him to finish I noticed an exhaust trail in the sky.  I look at it until I see the direction the source of the exhaust was flying.  As I observe the this, an object appears over to right of my field of view.  The object appears, moves quickly to the right, and disappears again.
