In the sky at first looked like a regular airplane it had what appeared to me to be 2 lights  where the nose of the plane would be . There was also 2 white lights on the tip of the wings .  The lights were not blinking . The aircraft appeared to be heading in the direction on the Warwick state Airport .  But as it got closer it looked like  it was coming in for a landing too prematurely .   When it got over us it was about maybe between 30 to 50 feet over the tree line s.  The weird thing was it  seemed to ahve slowed down in speed . My girlfriend said it wasnt moving . I was driving the car so it was hard to determine its true speed . But it wasnt in the manner a aircraft would conduct itself . I am thinking it might be a stealth aircraft . But Stealth s do they or can they stay in one spot for a few minutes? The Experience was certainly strange .;41.7692307692308;-71.4739009615386
