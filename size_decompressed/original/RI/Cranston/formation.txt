Saw a formation of crescent-shapped objects over suburban neighborhood.;2004-08-15 03:30:00;20+ minutes;Saw a formation of crescent-shapped objects over suburban neighborhood. I was sleeping over at my friends house, when i woke up to a soft humming noise.  I knew i was awake because my arm, which i had broken a week before, was in pain. I looked around to see what the noise was, didn't see anything, and eventually fell back asleep. about 10 minutes later i woke up again, but the sound was much louder. Upon looking outside, i saw what appeared to be five crescent-shaped flying objects hovering and moving at an extremely slow speed (slower than an average walk, i would guess). They were about 70 feet above the house two doors down from where i was. They stayed there for a bout five minutes. Upon telling this to my friend, i learned that he saw a similar incident three nights before. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
