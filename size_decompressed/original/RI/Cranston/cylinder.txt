Orange fiery cylinder traveling slowly across the night sky.  ((anonymous report))  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible airliner in Sun?  PD));2016-06-25 21:23:00;5 minutes;Orange fiery cylinder traveling slowly across the night sky. I was outside with the dog and looked up to see an orange fiery looking cylinder shape travelling across the night sky very slowly, south to north direction.  Kept watching it trying to figure out what I was seeing...at one point while it was leaving my field of vision, it looked like something sparked off of itâ€¦  I watched it until I couldn't see it any longer.   Cannot make sense of it. ((NUFORC Note:  If this is a sincere report, which we question, the object may have been a high-altitude airliner, reflecting sunlight.
