religious connection;1975-07-22 21:00:00;20 min;religious connection I was driving my daughter and her friends home from roller skating and the rural area that I was traveling (no houses) there was the brightest light in the woods to the left of the street about 200' away, I told my children lets drive down the dirt road toward the light, they agreed but as we go to within about 75' they went hysterical and I had to back out.  Also if your interested two talkmasters on WRKO in Boston were going to RI about early in the morning and a strange lighted craft followed them, as they talked about it on the program the producer told them not to talk about it.  Then my last experience was with a group of monasteries From MA, Conn, to NH that I had to evaluate for insurance. This group was devoted to silance and prayer. They were all constructed of huge stone (like a castle) The last monastery I had to inspect this brother could talk. In addition to asking a lot of religious question, I finally got around to asking him what he thought of UFO's and if there was any religious conitation to them..he told me to follow him, which I did we went up on the roof and he showed me this large (about 3 acre) stone enclosure, simular to the others I saw at the other monasteries. He said these are the landing fields where they will eventually land..my hair stood straight up..I have never told anyone about these experiences untils now, I think I feel better..;41.7692307692308;-71.4739009615386

There were 2 lights in the southern sky, one following the other, then a 3rd light shot from one of them and headed towards the ground.;2007-08-19 22:00:00;2 min;There were 2 lights in the southern sky, one following the other, then a 3rd light shot from one of them and headed towards the ground. Two friends and I were looking up at the stars, and we saw 2 bright lights in the southern sky, not too far from the ground. One was following the other one and they were maintaining a very even distance. At first we thought that they were planes, but we noticed that they weren't blinking like planes usually blink. So we kept watching them, and all of a sudden, the one in the back appeared to divide into 2, and the second light separated from it very quickly and appeared to go towards the ground. We lost the third light in the trees, then very soon after the original two that we were watching disappeared behind the trees. ((NUFORC Note:  ISS in formation with Space Shuttle??

See's light over Cranston;2008-07-12 00:38:00;approx. 12 minutes;See's light over Cranston I saw a U.F.O. above my appartment building at about 12:37 am on july 12th. it was bright, and glowed a sunshine yellow. It had now descernable shape, though it seemed circular, and seemed to be spinning. The event lasted aproximately 12 minutes. The object hovered in the sky for about 7 minutes, staying in one spot. After about seven minutes, it began to shift left and right. I recorded two videos, one about 1 minute long, the other just under 3 minutes long, on my phone. the event ended at about 12:50, when the U.F.O. vanished when i looked away. It was far away, yet, since i could not see any specific features about the object and it had nothing except sky behind it, i could not estimate a distance from where i was. Stranger than the actual U.F.O were the things that happened during the event. First of all, i live just off of a major avenue, which is always being used all hours of the day. During the time i saw the U.F.O., i didn't see a SINGLE car pass bye. Second, i didn't alert either my sister or mother, whom i live with, because (and i am realizing this as i write) during the event, i felt separated from the world, like it was me, the thing in the sky, and the road below my window. it took me several minutes to gain my sences after the thing dissapeared. It might have been shock and even fear of seeing something i couldn't explain in the sky over my home, or something else. Either way, it was indeed freaky.;41.7692307692308;-71.4739009615386

I got out of my car and asked what they are looking at and I looked up and witnessed 6 bright red lights that sat in the area for 30 minutes.   A few of them would disappeared and then return seconds later. one or two of them would change to a very very bright white light and the light would move as if it was searching for something, the light moving resembled a lighthouse light.   They were all grouped together and disappeared out of no where at the same time.   About an hour later I went outside and looked and saw a really close bright red blinking it was there for a while and it was very low.  It barely moved.;41.7692307692308;-71.4739009615386
Nine bright orange orbs drifted over Cranston, RI.;2016-06-11 01:00:00;15 minutes;Nine bright orange orbs drifted over Cranston, RI. Over the course of 15 minutes starting at 1 am 9 bright round but fuzzy orange orbs drifted by S to N in the Eastern sky.  First, a cluster of 3 followed by two twice, and then 2 singles.  I could easily glance at Mars, which has been prominent in the South.  These appeared 5 to 8 times bigger.  They have a silent drifting quality but always in a straight line.  Movement is about half the speed of a small plane. I am a retired Psychologist and my wife is an airplane buff.
