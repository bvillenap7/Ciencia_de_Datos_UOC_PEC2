A silvery egg-shaped craft is seen over a highway.;1999-07-06 00:00:00;10 seconds;A silvery egg-shaped craft is seen over a highway. I was on the way to visit my grandparents in Cranston,RI,USA, when I spotted a egg-shaped object moving at an incredibly high speed(a good deal faster than a commercial jet).  I am very skeptical of any Ufo sighting, and I can usally tell what something is right after I see it, but this had me stumped.  It wasn't any aircraft I know of, and I know of a good amount of aircraft.  It was too small to carry humans( about 5 ft. in diameter and 7ft long), and I don't see how it could fly as straight as it did, or how it could fly at all. There was a haze around it, but this might have been shock waves( like those visible when the F/A-18 hornet is approaching and reaching the sound barrier.  There was no aircraft following it(I beive the closest Fighter base to the sighting is Ottis ANG base, which deploys F-16 fighting falcons) and it was too small to appear on radar, so obviously there was no way for fighters to be scrambled to trail it.  It was silver-gray, and egg-shaped as I said.  It had no markings visible to me, although I only saw the underside of the craft and there may have been markings elsewhere.  I don't think it was an alien space craft, but it could have been an experimental military drone, possibly based at Quonset ANG, which would be the perfect place to keep the vehicle,seeing as Quonset has not had at test or fighter sqaudron based there since the 40's and 50's, so noone would look there. this is not the only explanation and I'm open to suggestions and I would enjoy them very much. All of this is true.  I won' send any pictures for I am not a good artist, but I think the above descriprtions are sufficient. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness is anonymous.
