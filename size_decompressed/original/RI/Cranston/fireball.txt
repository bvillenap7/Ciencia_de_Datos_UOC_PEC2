Thursday, June 14, 2012, about 11:00 PM.  Cranston, RI (Edgewood section).  I was inside and walking up my stairs when a bright light caught my eye outside the window.  I looked out and saw two very bright, large, fireballs moving across the sky, one some distance behind the other.  They seemed to be travelling the same path, at the same speed, as if one was following the other and they were moving from away from my house, towards the southwest. Immediately, I thought they could not be planes.  They were both very bright – their interior color was white/gold and the outer part of the balls was bright red, with a star-like, flaming appearance.  They did not look in any  way how planes look in a night sky – no flashing lights, only one glowing ball, as opposed to several small lights, etc. Because they appeared so unusual, I wondered if the thick glass of my window was distorting the light and causing the flame-like appearance and the color separation of the white/gold and red.  I went downstairs to a window that I could open that does not have a screen in it, and the balls looked exactly the same – bright white/gold interiors and red flame-like edges. They continued to move on the same path, away from me, toward the southwest, one behind the other, and then the one in the front and furthest away from me just disappeared from view (as opposed to fading away as it got further and further away.)  Then the second one disappeared.;41.7692307692308;-71.4739009615386
Orange ball of light hovering at a low altitude in cranston, vanishes then reappears seconds later in diff location;2013-03-03 21:00:00;1 minute;Orange ball of light hovering at a low altitude in cranston, vanishes then reappears seconds later in diff location I was driving southbound from park avenue toward warwick avenue.  Prior to reaching the light at the intersection saw a orange glowing luminous orb which seemed to have a glowing aura around it. It was not moving and was at a low altitude, as i glanced to my cell phones screen to aim it for a picture it disappeared.  When i got the green light I drove past a stop & shop on my right side and was looking around the sky for it, and saw it once again at a low altitude, it appeared to be hovering again but just in a different location.  I was unable to pull over at the time but by the time i did it was gone again.  There was no sound from the sphere of light or fireball light.  It was definitely not a helicopter or airplane, as I am very familiar with what they look like in the sky as I live down the street from an airport.;41.7692307692308;-71.4739009615386

At first i thought &quotWOW&quot a shooting I was driving to work and i saw a ball of fire falling from the sky in the far distance. At first i thought WOW a shooting star but as I continued to look it didn't appear to be that at all. I'm no expert but I've seen falling stars before and this did not look like what I have seen before. whatever it was it was definitely on fire and it there were flashes of light as pieces were breaking of the object. Im sure that i couldnt have been the only one to see this.. believe me it was hard to miss. Maybe it'll make the news.. ??????;41.7692307692308;-71.4739009615386
