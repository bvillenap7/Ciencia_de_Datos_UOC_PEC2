Two hovering black disk's, no lights. Seen by 2 people and photographed;2014-01-30 17:30:00;1 minute;two hovering black disk's, no lights. Seen by 2 people and photographed I was driving down the the highway when I saw two hovering black disk's out the passenger window.  I told my boyfriend to look and he grabbed a series of pictures showing the objects stading still in the sky (hovering).  They were circular and had no lights, they were hovering next to eachother but one higher in the air at a slight diagonal angle. We took the next exit and headed towards where we saw them,  Over the West Greenwich Dunes.  We had lost them in the trees after taking the exit and by the time we reached the area they were previously above, they were gone.  We also noticed a Helicopter moving towards the dunes as we were trying to drive there. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
