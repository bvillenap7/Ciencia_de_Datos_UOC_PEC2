I woke my husband up and I told him somebody was outside but when we looked there was NO CAR there just these 3 round orbs of light floating around in the air.   My husband ran down the stairs and flew  out the front door and by the time he got out the door the lights had just vanished.

Bright light in sky seen by two sisters over East Greenwich, RI;2016-06-01 00:52:00;2 minutes;Bright light in sky seen by two sisters over East Greenwich, RI My sister and I were travelling on I-95 South and could see a very solid, non-blinking, bright light straight ahead, it moved from the middle of our point of view to the right then left side of the highway.  The sky was completely dark, aside from the stars.   We lost sight in the tree line, until taking exit 5B where once on the off-ramp it became a plane, flying so low that we could see both the underbelly of it and exactly how many lights were across it's wings, it was also completely silent.  The plane was way too low in this area to have been an actual airplane, considering any airport is more than fifteen to twenty miles away in either direction.   Once it had crossed over the top of our car and back over the tree line, it was gone.;41.64;-71.6435
