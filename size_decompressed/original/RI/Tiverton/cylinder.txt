While traveling north on Fish Road I observed what appeared to be a brilliantly lighted object against a clear blue cloudless sky. It was difficult to determine if the object was providing its own source of light or was merely reflecting sunlight as it seemed to emit a welding-arc type of brightness. The shape was cylindrical and it appeared to be in an upright position. The truck I was riding in was stopped behind a schoolbus picking up students. I observed the object remain stationary in the sky for a couple of seconds, then watched as it dropped at a 45 degree angle at a phenomenal rate of speed and simply disappeared from sight. There were no objects to obscure my line of vision as I observed this. The object for all intents and purposes vanished from sight. The driver of our vehicle, to my delight, also witnessed the event and expressed his surprise as well. It would be extremely difficult to not have noticed the object as its illumination was quite vivid. There were no interior lights on in the vehicle and as we were stopped for a schoolbus (as were other vehicles), no chance of another vehicle's movement reflected on our windshield. As someone with an interest in unusual phenomena, and trained to look for rational explanations before declaring anything to be beyond that - this was pretty breath taking.
