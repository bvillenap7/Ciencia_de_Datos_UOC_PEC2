5 oblong shaped fireballs seen in the sky over Tiverton, Middletown, RI 11-5-2015.;2015-11-05 16:30:00;45 minutes;5 oblong shaped fireballs seen in the sky over Tiverton, Middletown, RI 11-5-2015. We saw 5 of these oblong shaped fireballs in the sky tonight.  Each dropped out from within the clouds and went in a South Westerly direction.   There were planes in the area following these things so someone knows what they are or has seen them at a closer distance.  The planes and one helicopter are still out there searching at this time which is 17:30.   These fireballs seemed to almost stop at times, before moving along and through my binoculars they pretty much looked like a ball of radiated fire.   I took pictures on my cell phone and even though they're not that clear, you can tell that they're some sort of a flaming craft of some sort even though there is no visible structure to these things.  I'm stumped.;41.6361;-71.1808
