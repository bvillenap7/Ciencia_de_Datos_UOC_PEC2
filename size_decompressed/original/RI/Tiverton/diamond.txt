As I was closing my blind for the night, I happened to look up into the sky directly across from my window and noticed a huge craft shaped like a diamond  with lights on both sides and the object looked like a diamond shape.  The lights never blinked but it hovered over the trees for about 4 minutes, jerked forward a little then took off in a direction over my house.  I heard no noise and when it took off it seemed as though the lights went off.  The lights seemed to come down into a point from both sides.  There only seemed to be one large object.;41.6361;-71.1808
