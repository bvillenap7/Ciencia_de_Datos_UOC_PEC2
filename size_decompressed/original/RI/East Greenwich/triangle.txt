Triangular ship, stationary, black body, white lights on the three corners and a blinking red/white strobe dead center.;2005-04-14 20:30:00;1-2mins;Triangular ship, stationary, black body, white lights on the three corners and a blinking red/white strobe dead center. I was driving south on route 4 in East Greenwich by the Quonset Point exit.  I saw a Triangle craft (dark shape three lights on each corner (white) and a blinking strobe (redish /white) dead center.  There will 2 state policeman pulled off to the other side of the road (rt 4 noth).   There was no construction and no accident. They were side by side with there windows down.  I did not stop, but slowed to about 30mph and rolled my window down.  There was no sound coming from the craft and it was surely not moving.   I am very familiar with this road and I know that there is no tower there.  I continued driving and when I looked in my rear-view mirror there was nothing in the sky.  I am positive that this was not a helicopter and if it was a plane it made no noise what so ever and was hovering.  Can planes hover and not make noise?  The estimated height of the craft from the ground was 1-2000 feet.;41.6528;-71.4697000000001
Three bright white lights in a triangular shape - with a red pulsing light at the rear moving over highway - LOW;2010-09-15 22:45:00;1 minute;Three bright white lights in a triangular shape - with a red pulsing light at the rear moving over highway - LOW I was traveling home on 95 northbound out of East Greenwich Rhode Island last night after spending a few hours taking my jeep down 4x4 trails.  As RT.95 merged with RT.4 northbound, I noticed a strange arrangement of lights in the sky just east of me, prob. less than a mile away, and less than 1,000 feet above the tree line heading N.E.E over the tree line at Apprx. 10:45 p.m..  As being a Rhode Island resident all my life, and always living less than 12 miles from T.F. Green Airport, Im used to the normal Airplanes and Airliners either coming in on approach, or taking off from that airport - and seeing the normal navigation lights - the strobing blues or greens.  But this was different - It was a light arrangement of which i had neverseen before,  And It Shocked ME !!  Three Bright White Lights forming a triangular shape, with a pulsing red light at the rear of the object that directly in line with the two outer white lights which were actually strobing in sy! nc with each other !!!  I have never seen this kind of arrangement my entire life, and it baffles me ! I am so interested in seeing if anyone else had reported it, and i also felt so compeled by this event that i drew an exact picture as i remember it from the event using windows art. If you would like to view the picture i can email it upon request, and also if you could help me out on what this could be if it wasnt a ufo, I would really appreciate it. Thanks !!!;41.6528;-71.4697000000001
