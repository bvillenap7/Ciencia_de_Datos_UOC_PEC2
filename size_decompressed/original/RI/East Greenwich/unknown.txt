Super fast circular object zipped across the night sky;2019-09-13 21:37:00;4 seconds;Super fast circular object zipped across the night sky I witnessed a craft about a mile up with different colored lights zip through the sky faster than anything I’ve ever scene.  It didn’t make a sound and didn’t appear to put off any exhaust.  Faster than a shooting star and definitely faster than any military aircraft I’ve ever witnessed.;41.6528;-71.4697000000001
