The UFO was circular in shape, with three distinct propulsion units on the bottom,and several red rectangular lights around the perimeter.  I witnessed this UFO when I was leaving work to drive home.  It was travelling in straight lines, forming a triangular pattern, approximate airspeed was about 150 MPH as far as I could tell.  I had the impression that it was of the type described by Bob Lazar, UUP/element 115propulsion. After approximately 5 minutes,the UFO sped away to the north.  I believe that I was in some kind of mental contact with the occupants of the craft at the time,as the triangular course seemed to circle directly around me also. I am currentlyworking on some sketches of the craft, bu tI thought it important to report the event as soon as possible.  I will email the sketches in JPEG format as soon as they are complete.Perhaps they were interested in this location because it is in proximity to several of our National Guard military installations.;41.6528;-71.4697000000001

I watched for it for about 5-8 min to watch it rise back up without sound and veer off to the right as it rose and then had greenish blue, burgandy, and orange lights as well as u could clearly make the shape out with how bright the lights were. ((NUFORC Note:  We have amended the time, to reflect a morning sighting.  We have attempted to contact the source to confirm, but have not heard back from him.  PD);41.6528;-71.4697000000001
