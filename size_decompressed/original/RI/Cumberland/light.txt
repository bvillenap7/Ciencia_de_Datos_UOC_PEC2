I saw a bright light off in the distance in MA, to my right, come out of nowhere from the sky and shoot down toward earth at an extreme;2015-10-16 20:00:00;3-4 seconds;I was heading from Rhode Island toward Massachusetts on 295 on 10/16 between 7:30- 8:00 PM, when I saw a bright light off in the distance in MA, to my right, come out of nowhere from the sky and shoot down toward earth at an extremely high rate of speed.  I watched it and expected to hear or feel something when it impacted thinking it may have been a meteor.  But there was nothing.  It was quite a distance away while I continued to drive, I then saw three planes flying in the general area the light appeared.  They came from three different directions.  Then all disappeared heading in the same direction.;41.9511000000001;-71.413
Hovering and flashing light in night sky seen for 45 minutes.  ((NUFORC Note:  Cappella or Venus?  PD));2017-10-10 02:00:00;2:45;Hovering and flashing light in night sky seen for 45 minutes. At around 2am I laid down to sleep and noticed a bright light in the sky that should have been moving if it were an airplane or satellite.  Instead, it flashed/shimmered in one spot.  Sometimes the flash would be on the right side and then on the left later.  It just hovered in the same spot in the sky.  After about 45 minutes of watching it I finally fell asleep.  Initially, I thought it was a dying star, but it was exponentially brighter than anything else in sky.  Additionally, the flashing/shimmering wasn’t on side, then the other, not all over it.;41.9511000000001;-71.413
