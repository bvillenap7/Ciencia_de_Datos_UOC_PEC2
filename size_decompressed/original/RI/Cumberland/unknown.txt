In line strobe lights over Cumberland, RI;2005-09-12 22:45:00;2 minutes;In line strobe lights over Cumberland, RI Looking to the sky around 10:45 pm I noticed 2 very bright white strobe lights flashing at the same time, with about a 1 second interval between flashes.  They got my attention because they were in line with each other, not side by side as a typical aircraft would be.  There were no other distiguishable lights.  There was no noise heard during of after that I could attribute to the lights.  The lights moved SW to NE across the sky rather quickly and then got to a point where they seemed to become stationary, and continued to flash.  At that point I watched for about 45 seconds while the lights got closer together and then faded away while still blinking at what appeared to be the same rate.  When I could no longer see the lights, I turned back to the direction the lights were moving from and I could make out a contrail, howver it was quite far to the side of where the lights were.;41.9511000000001;-71.413

Most were hovering in the sky.  Looks like they were performing some sort of exercise.   I live in Cumberland Diamond Hill Road.;41.9511000000001;-71.413
