The lights were yellow orange, like a flame from a fire.  They appeared to be round with a haze around them so I couldn’t determine a shape. There was no sound and they seemed to be traveling at a steady rate of speed. They were following each other but were not close together. The night was overcast so they appeared to disappear once they got far enough away. The lights did not blink, they were steady, like a burning flame. As the 3rd light passed over, we lost internet connection  for a brief period of time. We believe that UFO’s probably exist, but until now, we’ve never seen anything to cement that belief.;41.9511000000001;-71.413
