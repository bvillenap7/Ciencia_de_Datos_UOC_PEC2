Walked outside to garage, immediately caught my eye sphere shape. Thought it was balloons at 1st because the way Sun was hitting it. Wa;2015-10-10 15:45:00;40-60 seconds;Walked outside to garage, immediately caught my eye sphere shape.  Thought it was balloons at 1st because the way Sun was hitting it.  Was not moving just rotating, if it was moving I couldn't tell but I opened back door, turned to call my wife, as she walked towards the door, I turned around to say look right there, it was gone. This was the size of half of a hot air balloon from the distance from me.;41.9734;-71.5457
Shiny sphere sighted over N. Smithfield farm.;2019-06-22 15:00:00;2 minutes;Shiny sphere sighted over North Smithfield farm. I was mowing a lawn at my mothers farm when it started to rain.  I raced back to the garage to get to a dry area and the rain started mixing with hail.  I stayed in the garage for 10 mins then went back outside and looked up at the clouds to try and see if more rain was coming.   That’s when I noticed a small circular object passing just below cloud level.  I think it was metal as when the sun reflected off it you could see it shine like chrome.   I squinted hard to see it as it was very small.  It moved slowly across the sky, sometimes dipping into the clouds. It left no chemtrails or smoke behind it and made no sound.  It definitely wasn’t a plane.  It definitely wasn’t a balloon either as its path was straight and deliberate.;41.9734;-71.5457
