Maybe they're satellites, I don't know, but they are there.  On this particular night, I was watching one of these star things when out of nowhere appear these two orange, dimly lit lights, traveling northwest in a parallel orientation. They were moving very fast, but were only visible for a few moments, then they were gone.  They were real. I saw them with my own two eyes.  What the hell is up there?;41.9734;-71.5457
