Driving north on route 102, Great Road, looked up at sky while driving spotted an extremely super fast object traveling left to right.  Direction towards earth was from 10 o'clock to 4 o'clock.  It was blue with hints of green toward tailend.  Shaped like an elongated tear drop with the bubble part of tear drop being the front traveling right,east.   It was bright like the moon and color encompassed the whole object.   The sky was clear because I could see stars but the object suddenly just disappeared.   I thought it may be a meteorite and reported there as well.;41.9734;-71.5457
Watching 2 sets of lights in sky when the 1st set flashed, became one single light & shot straight to the ground.;2015-11-04 09:02:00;35-50 seconds;Watching 2 sets of lights in sky when the 1st set flashed, became one single light & shot straight to the ground. Sitting on back steps using Tablet, looked up in sky to see what I thought was 2 planes because of typical blinking lights & I could hear the engine sound. Both approximately same altitude & about 300 yrds apart. Blinking lights further away was moving faster then blinking lights in front, I called my son to come outside and look at these planes. As we watched the two sets of lights getting closer to each other, we thought they were going to hit each other, just about 150 - 200 yrds apart the front set of lights made a big flash, became a single bright light (like a star in the sky) & shot straight to the ground extremely fast (My son & I both yelled at same time, Did you see that), while the other set of lights continued to move forward towards Lincoln, RI, airport. We could hear plane getting further away so the pilot of that plane 100% had to of seen this craft or what ever those lights were, impossible that pilot not to see, Too close together!!!;41.9734;-71.5457
