softball sized white orb, moving very fast.;2019-10-24 22:31:00;10 seconds;softball sized white orb, moving very fast Last night as I was driving home from work at 10:30pm, I turned onto the dark, somewhat rural road that leads to my own street, and I saw a large deer to my left.   I was thinking about the seer and using extra caution (going about 15mph) heading south when something flew up from behind me, also moving in a southern direction. A softball size, very bright white light flew from behind my car, approximately 20 feet above and moving at a very fast speed.  The orb flew under some low trees and then over the roof of a ranch style house on the corner of my street and disappeared from my view.  I did not encounter it again. What was remarkable to me is that my husband has reported seeing these orbs on more than one occasion since the middle of the summer.  He has seen them further away, north of where I saw the flying object.  I thought he must have been seeing commercial spotlights, but now that I have seen this orb I can characterize it only as an unidentified flying object.;41.7241;-71.2657
