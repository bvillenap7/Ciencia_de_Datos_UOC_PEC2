((HOAX??)) Triangular moving quickly over Warren RI and turned around when it was spotted.;2017-04-18 22:00:00;30 seconds;Triangular moving quickly over Warren RI and turned around when it was spotted. Headed out to sell a guitar at a local gas station and as I pulled to the end of my street to turn on the main road, I saw a very big, very low craft moving quite quickly but silently. Planes do fly low over here many times and this was no plane.   It was triangular in shape and moving too fast.  Directly across the end of my street is a large cemetery.   It was flying towards me and when I slowed down to get a good look at it, it quickly pulled a sharp U-turn and went the other way.  Planes do not do that either.   Very cool indeed! ((NUFORC Note:  We telephoned the witness, but he was not very co-operative.  We wonder whether this might be a hoaxed report.  PD));41.7241;-71.2657

ITS NOT A HOAX, BUT UNLESS I SPECIFY THAT I WILL TALK ON THE PHONE, IT IS NOT OK TO CALL ME. JUST BECAUSE I DO NOT WISH TO SPEAK ON THE PHONE DOES NOT MAKE IT A HOAX.  PERIOD.
