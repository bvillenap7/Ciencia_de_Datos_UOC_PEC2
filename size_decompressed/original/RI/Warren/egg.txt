While going out to dinner with my wife and daughter, I noticed an object hovering in the sky, west of my location. None of the stars were out just yet, it was dusk. The object was very bright, shaped like an upside down egg.  Both my wife and I got out of the car for a better look.  This is when I noticed, a blue glowing wispy tail made up of smaller blue glowing orbs that undulated, as if were blowing in a breeze.  The tail was 3 times longer than the main object, but in contained in its glow.  Between the main object and the base of the tail I could see 2 small red orbs that looked to be alternating on and off.  The main object seemed to glow with that shimmery soap bubble effect where you see a rainbow of colors. It made no sound that I could hear.  My house is in the flight path to the state's airport, so I'm use to seeing planes in the sky and very familiar with aircraft lights. This was not that. My wife who's skeptical of the whole UFO thing had to admit th! e object was strange and not a star or a planet. After getting back from our dinner we grabbed our binoculars to get a better look since it was still in the sky, but further away and more south. The stars were out now and we could see the big dipper.  This object was brighter than any of the stars visible. We checked the constellation maps and planet Venus was the brightest but it had already set. I kept checking throughout the evening and the object had drifted back to where I first saw it. By then the stars were clouded over, but I could still see this thing. So what ever it was it was below the clouds. Weird. I attempted to photograph with my cell phone, but the images captured looked like fuzzy blobs.;41.7241;-71.2657
