Light over T F Green Airport.;1978-10-17 15:00:00;1-2 minutes;Light over T F Green Airport This was my first UFO siting. I lived on Market St, Warren, Rhode Island.  I was walking to my friends home at 3 pm.  I looked up into the sky over the Bay and noticed a light. My first thought was that it was too early for the stars to be out.  I also knew that it was in our atmosphere as it was too close to be a star.  I watched it for about 30 seconds and then it shot downwards at a 30 degree left angle, stopped, and then shot upward vertically to a point like a reverse check mark.  It then disappeared.  This event was recorded by others because it happened over T F Green Airport and the event was printed in a book that I read in 1993.;41.7241;-71.2657
