There were absolutely no stars in the sky anywhere.  I saw this object just above the moon and slightly to the left and it changed from whitish to light bluish and back to whitish.  I took 2 pictures, batteries went dead in camera.  I went in the house and replaced the batteries, when I came back out about 15-20 minutes later it was gone.  I took 2 pictures while it was there and 3 pictures after it was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Two photos sent to NUFORC.  It looks to us as though it may be a bright star, but that is only a guess.
