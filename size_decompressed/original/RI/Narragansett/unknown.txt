Newton Ave/ Hazard Rock area- Huge hovering object with light formations dissapeared.;2011-09-03 22:15:00;2 minutes;Newton Ave/ Hazard Rock area- Huge hovering object with light formations dissapeared. Last night around 10:15-10:30 in my house I heard a strange noise that I could not identify. The noise sounded like someone throwing things around or hitting things and I could not determine whether or not it was from in my house or outside.  The noise persisted and I got a very strange feeling so I went downstairs and out on the deck to investigate more. My little brother said he did not hear anything, and as I was describing to him the strange feeling I had and noise I heard I looked out the window to my right.  The sky looked like it was flashing. I yelled to my brother to get up and come look and he replied that it was lightning, although it was only in one part of the sky (in the North East) directly out the second floor window we were looking.   As we kept watching the strobe-lighted sky, a strange formation of red, blue and white lights rose from behind the trees. It grew bigger, may have been spherical and was obstructed from complete view. we watched i! t silently as it appeared to hover tree level directly at us, its lights blinking in a strange formation.  Seconds later it was gone.  There was now nothing where we were looking, just the normal night sky. I don't know what we saw, and my brother agrees it was very strange, although is skeptical (There MUST be some explanation). I am especially freaked out because I just discovered this website randomly the day before. I had a wierd feeling and it led me to this window and what I saw I can not forget or ignore. We drove to where I thought it was but there was nothing there. I am going today to walk along the ocean shore and see if there is anything unusual.;41.4343;-71.4589
