Diamond Shape object with a yellowish orange glow or aura around it.Pitch black;2003-08-17 00:00:00;drive by;Diamond Shape object with a yellowish orange glow or aura around it.Pitch black I was just getting out of the Twin Willows restaurant   about 1130pm or midnight. I was travelling up tower hill road in Narragansett. I noticed a light in the sky at my left.  I was fixated on this object for about a minute or two while I was at a red light.  As the light turned green, I noticed to my right that there was a gold jaguar on my right waiting for me to pass.  I proceeded to go past the object. I noticed that it was a diamond shape. It was jet black like the night, and it had an orange yellowish aura around it.  As I passed it I was staring at it while I was driving, it must have been less than 200 feet in the air. I noticed as I drove by there was someone behind me flashing there light’s at me to get me to pull over.  I was really excited about seeing this object in the air. I said to myself I knew there was something out there.  My uncle renato niccolai from France saw one about 30 years ago. It landed in his garden and then took off.  I have always been fascinated by this subject since I was a little kid. As I drove by I felt excited and then I felt very afraid of what I was witnessing. I have never felt those emotions at the same time.  It was intense. I didn’t stop and get out of my car as I was confused about what it was.  I think about it all the time now. I wish I had some proof, but unfortunately I don’t. If you could ever find this guy from Rhode Island with a gold jaguar somehow. I’m sure He would tell you the same story If not more. He had stopped to look at the object. I continued driving..;41.4343;-71.4589
