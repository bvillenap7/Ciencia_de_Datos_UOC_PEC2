We thought at first it was a plane's headlight coming straight toward us but realized that it was stationary in that part of the sky an odd light due to brightness and amber color.  As we watched it for several minutes it slowly began to fade to a barely visible point of light, not moving from that location. At that time my friend said she saw an arc of light in that same area and afterwards a fast up and down shaft of light lasting a second. I was scanning the sky elsewhere so I didn't see what she saw. There were other traveling lights in that same area but they looked like far-off planes the sky was very clear.  We could not come up with any explanation for what we saw other than a UFO.;41.4343;-71.4589

It disappeared within a minute of appearing then reappeared several minutes later and zipped across the sky before vanishing.    Shortly after, planes stared flying the area the light was in.  I wouldnâ€™t have thought much about it until it shot across the sky..  It went from a sit still to the speed of a shooting star in a instant.  Pretty incredible.
