Large, silent, low, gliding craft over the RI shoreline;2007-06-07 21:15:00;10 minutes;Large, silent, low, gliding craft over the RI shoreline While riding my motorcycle along Rt.1A, heading south, I noticed what at first I thought was a large plane flying very low and slow to my left, that is along the shoreline.  I saw two large lights at either end, as in wingtips, but oddly they were not flashing nor were they the green and red normal flight lights. Rather, there was a large white light on one end and the other end was a very odd amber-tinged white light.  Most striking was the intense flashing white strobe light underneath the craft with another one, smaller, also white, in back of it.  Then, as I viewed the silent craft from behind I was stunned to see three oblong green lighted areas, subdued in color, but a lime green.  Never have I seen this type of lighting on any aircraft.  These lights, plus the odd gliding way the craft moved, convinced me that it was a UFO.   I turned my bike around and headed north to follow the craft.  I took a road down to the water's edge so I could view the extremely bright flashing strobes of the craft as it glided over the Jamestown bridge and watched it as it went toward the old Quonsett Naval Air Station area, now used by the Air National Guard and private enterprises.  The craft was far too big, too low, and too slow to be anything conventional, disregarding the odd lighting on it.   I saw a similar craft over the Perryville, RI, area two years ago, but the lighting was different on it.  The same low, silent, gliding motion was present.  Someone surely must have seen this object as there was lots of traffic, both cars and boats in the water.;41.4343;-71.4589
