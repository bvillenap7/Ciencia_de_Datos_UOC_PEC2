((HOAX??)) As my friend and I were driving home late one night, I was staring out at the window gazing at the stars when I noticed one.;2005-06-30 00:00:00;10 MINUTES;As my friend and I were driving home late one night, I was staring out at the window gazing at the stars when I noticed one particular one that was much brighter than the others.  I remember saying to myself Wow, thats a bright star.   Then we both noticed how much bigger and brighter was becoming and within seconds it was right over our head and hovering above a corn field we were driving by.  It was a black triangle. It was rather small and moved so quickly.  I remember it head green to red lights glowing around it...and as we turned onto the street it was lowering itself onto, we pulled up close enough to listen to it...but there was no noise whatsoever.   Right when I began to open my door to get a closer look it flew straight up and away as fast as it came. I was scared.  I screamed. ((NUFORC Note:  Date in 2005 is approximate.

Triangle aircraft moving in various patterns across the sky with pulsating lights.  ((anonymous report));2019-02-09 02:55:00;10 minutes;Triangle aircraft moving in various patterns across the sky with pulsating lights My wife and I looked up at the sky... saw a triangle shaped object in the sky that seemed to be moving in different patterns, zipping and moving up and down in the sky.  It was definitely some sort of aircraft.... it was triangle shaped, and seemed to have a pulsating light that would go off every minute or so.  The object would disappear, then show itself again, staying in the same part of the sky, but in the up and down pattern previously mentioned.  Never have seen anything like this before.  This was late at night with no airplanes known in the area at 3 am. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));41.8284;-71.5234999999999
