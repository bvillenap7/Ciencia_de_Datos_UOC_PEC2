I was walking up the street to my friends house and I felt leaves blowing up against the back of me, and a loud strong wind.  I looked back over my left shoulder and Frooze in fear.  The disc shaped object almost looked as if it was moving in a slow spinning rotation.   I ran as fast as I could into my friend's house and bursted into tears.  I know someone else must have seen it that day.   Now 15 1/2 years later I feel more comfortable to talk about this incident.  I donâ€™t care who is skeptical.  I know what I seen and the image is still clear as day in my head. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));41.8284;-71.5234999999999

4 objects seen in upper atmosphere maneuvering at high speed then up out of sight!;2013-09-29 18:00:00;90 seconds;4 objects seen in upper atmosphere maneuvering at high speed then up out of sight! My friend and I  were outside. I walked away for a minute. I came back and he said,  do you see that?  I looked up and saw 4 objects way..way up!  For about 30 seconds I saw them fly away and towards each other, a couple going up and down out of sight! Then all of them went out of sight!   We could see the sunlight  reflecting of them which makes me think they weren't military.  We watched a few planes pass over after for reference and these things were up there and moving very fast.;41.8284;-71.5234999999999
