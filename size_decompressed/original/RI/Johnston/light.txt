Red sphere in sky.;2014-07-28 22:00:00;7 minutes;Red sphere in sky. At 21:15 or so, I was in my kitchen looking out the window and noticed a glowing dark orange/red sphere in the sky behind the tree line.   The object seemed very odd so I made my way outside to observe it further.   Whatever it was, the object was heading Northeast at fair amount of speed.  I watched it for a good 7-8 minutes before it ultimately accelerated and was quickly out of sight.   My house is on a private driveway and the streets were also devoid of any vehicles, so it was very strange, as I have aircraft flying by routinely, but this one had no sound at all and there were no other lights on it.;41.8284;-71.5234999999999
