Cube haystack shape seen a between 1997-1998 (not sure of exact date)........;1997-01-01 15:30:00;1 min;Cube haystack shape seen a between 1997-1998 (not sure of exact date)........ It was an object thats was floating in the distance but not too far. from the place we were standing it looked like a haystack but it must have been big for the size it looked to us. I am not sure about the date but it was around 1997 - 1998. I never heard anything about it, but there was no chance it was a plane because of the odd cube shape and yello color. we watched it untill it floated down below the trees.
