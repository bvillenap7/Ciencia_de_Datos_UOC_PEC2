Bright greenish blue circular disc object moving over head leaving a white trail behind it.;2013-09-01 01:30:00;5 seconds;bright greenish blue circular disc object moving over head leaving a white trail behind it. I was Driving south on 146 south going towards Providence RI when in front of me I see this circular object moving at a very high speed flash by over head of my car heading north on 146.  The Object was a greenish blue light that was leaving a almost white trail behind it.  The light gave me the impression the object was spinning as it moved through the night sky.  My first thought was “Oh look a shooting star”, but I quickly detained that idea because of the flight the object was on and the color it radiated.  I would say the disc object was no more than 500ft in the air.  Also at the time I saw the object I got a great look at it because of the heat lightning that was occurring during my entire drive.  This is why I was glaring up at the sky on this night because of the beautiful lighting.  The lighting gave me a clear look at this object and all I can say is it was nothing I have ever seen before in my life.;41.8547;-71.4736
