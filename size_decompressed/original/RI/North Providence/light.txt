Read above.  ((NUFORC Note: We wonder whether the object might have been in the SW sky, therefore, Venus.  PD));2013-11-24 19:00:00;2.5 hours;read above Around appx. 7pm, my friend and myself had noticed a bright white light in the horizon southeast of State RT#44 we thought it originally was a star or planet butt the position seemed to near to our view to be either.   As we able to get a closer look at it i noticed it had some type of flashing light on the top center of the object.   As we proceeded west on RT#44 i noticed it moving as we arrived at the Smithfield Commons Target Plaza, in Smithfield RI.  In the parking lot i asked the people pushing the shopping carts what they thought it was, they said wow thats weird probably a secret drone or something.   then we left i arrived at home in N. Prov we noticed the object had moved to the northwest quite a distance as i staring at the object, another object shaped like a triangle with rouned edges kinda flew overhead dead silent and the entire bottom was illumating like trace lights red and greenish and even a purple shade.   that was it and i was wondering if anyone else saw it or if im nutts!!!!!!!!!!!!!!;41.8547;-71.4736
