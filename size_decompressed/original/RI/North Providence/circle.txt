They each had their own flight path in seperate directions and would meet together at a pinpoint.  One light would go up, one would go left, one would go right, and one would go down.   Together they were making one big, spinning, circular motion at a far distance from each other.  They each made that same pattern over and over which would last about maybe five seconds and then they would meet at that pinpoint.   This went on for a little over an hour.  Eventually they met together at that pinpoint and then simply vanished.  It totally blew my mind. ((NUFORC Note:  Advertising lights??  PD));41.8547;-71.4736
Bright light moving very fast in a pointed direction across the sky.;2015-09-14 23:45:00;3 seconds;Bright light moving very fast in a pointed direction across the sky. Driving north-northeast, I came around a bend in the road to see a very bright light travel at a high speed going due north.  It moved directly but there appeared to be a slight curve in its motion. It was too bright and moving too fast to be a plane, and also too low to the ground considering the relative lack of proximity of airports in the area.  It was also a single light and not a collection.  It would also have had to be the largest and brightest shooting star that Iâ€™ve ever seen.  The light only appeared for a few seconds before it disappeared behind the tree line. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

The lights appeared to be 1000 to 2000 ft above me and they were arranged in a zig zag, constellation like formation.;41.8547;-71.4736
