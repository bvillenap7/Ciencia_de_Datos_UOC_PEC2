((HOAX??  Obscene))  A life situation loke no other.;1996-06-01 23:00:00;16 seconds;a life situation loke no other As i observed the sky i saw a tiny object become larger and larger as it entered the earths atmosphere, amazing to me the white colored sphere speed deceleratered, slowing down at an rate that was controlled, the sphere stopped, and paused for about five seconds, best to my recollection, and it traversed in turn at a approx 45 degree turn, however it the speed of acceleration at an angle like that was once in a lifetime vision, the ufo's.  excelleration momention was at first enoormous momentum, however, the speed excellerated exponentially from the northern sky to the southern sky in about two seconds.   I stood up and yelled out, What ((deleted)) was that!  The object flew at an arch and not a straight line no meteor nothing like ive ever seen in my whole life no doubt, another life form;41.8547;-71.4736
Red sphere at a Fireworks display in Rhode Island 2013;2013-07-04 20:00:00;3 minutes;Red sphere at a Fireworks display in Rhode Island 2013. On 08/04/2013  ((sic.  July 4th??)) around 20:00hrs pm my son and myself were watching fireworks on the stairs at my house(Fireworks about 1 mile away south) when a red sphere like object seem to come out of the treeline under the fireworks. At first we were waiting for it to explode but it didn't, the object climbed to what I could tell was 100 feet off the ground then took a hard left turn west. My son and myself both realized it was not part of the firework display and I sent my son into the house for the camcorder. My son ran out of the house to the stairs with the camera running and pointed it at the object then recorded about 3 to 4 seconds before we lost it the treeline west when we first seen it. Note: the object made no sound, had no tail or markings and did a upward left turn. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));41.8547;-71.4736
