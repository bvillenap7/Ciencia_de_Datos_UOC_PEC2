Unknown red ball object in the sky near fireworks display.;2013-07-04 21:20:00;5 minutes;Unknown red ball object in the sky near fireworks display. On July 4th 2013 around 8.00 pm my son and myself were at the front of my house watching Fireworks from a church about a mile(looking south east)when after a large red air burst we seen a red ball seem to rise out of the treeline near the fireworks,we both looked at each other at the same time and my son said Dad Whats that red thing! We watched the object fly slowly at about 200 Ft off the ground and I would guess its speed was around 100 MPH moving North as it passed it made no sound.  It was 15ft around and had a red glow to it. My son ran into the house to grab the camcorder and recorded 10 seconds of video before we lost sight of it in the trees away from my house.we did not see anything on the video due to my son moving the camera around trying to record it. I've never seen anything like this and have no clue on what that was, I know this was not a Jet or a plane.;41.8547;-71.4736
Bright, white, low object split second gone.;2013-11-29 08:07:00;4 seconds;Bright, white, low object split second gone. I went outside to have a cigarette and not even after I lit it I looked up in the sky like I do every night and all of a sudden I see this large white round.  Thing zooming, loosing altitude  it was not high in the sky at all maybe just higher than a oak tree I ran out to the middle of my street and it was gone...  So weird it kinda looked like a bright white comet with a tail.  but left no trail.   Did anyone else see this?
