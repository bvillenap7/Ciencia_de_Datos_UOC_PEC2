Orange/Reddish light, a bit bigger than the north star, very bright, very star like glow from it.  It was still for a bit then hovered around like a balloon, then traveled slowly straight down past the tree line.   Immediately afterwards 3 airplanes passed, one from the west, two from the east.  Object was located in the north.  Movement was not hurried or erratic.  Smooth, small, hovering motion followed by smooth direct descent.   I saw this with my friend, 5min later my neighbor came over and reported that he saw it in the south doing the same thing.;41.9644;-71.7095
