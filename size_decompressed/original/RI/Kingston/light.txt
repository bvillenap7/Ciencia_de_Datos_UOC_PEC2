Red star weaving back and forth across the sky;2012-05-12 01:30:00;5-6 seconds;red star weaving back and forth across the sky i go to the university of rhode island, we have an airforce base about 5 miles from campus with constant low flying military planes so i was very hesitant at first to believe what i saw.  i was on the roof of the building i live in just looking at stars.at first i thought it was a shooting star, it would follow a shooting star comming from the south then would stop directly above me, weave in and out of the big dipper slowly, then speed up towards polaris and make a full loop and shoot back towards the west, weaving in and out of stars. it appeared each time as a red star. i thought it was a shooting star but it came back 5 more times, each time varying speed and changing its direction. the last time it appeared as a blinking star then when i noticed it was pulsating, it shot to the east, then immediatley back to the west. about 15 minutes after the sighting there were 1-2 , low flying military helicopters flying across the campus from the west to the east w! hich is EXTREMELY unusual, we have  low flying planes but never low flying helicopters.;41.479;-71.5327
