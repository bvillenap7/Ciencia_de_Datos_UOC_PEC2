Pinkish Red Fireball Flash Sighting.  ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  PD));2007-09-15 19:35:00;2 minutes;Pinkish Red Fireball Flash Sighting Me and my roommate were in our room when we looked outside and saw a pinkish red flash flying through the sky. Upon seeing this, we went out on our balcony and tried to get a picture of the object which shot through the sky, changing directions and then shooting off as it disapeared. We got a picture of it but it is blurry.  ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  PD));41.479;-71.5327
Fireballs all moving same direction.;2014-10-09 22:00:00;1/2 hour;Fireballs all moving same direction My Husband was outside letting our Dog out.  He called me out to look at something as soon as he pointed to the sky I saw 2 fireballs one right after another coming from the West then curving moving South.  A few minutes later a couple more came, I actually went inside to put on a jacket when I came back out there were 2 more.  And why I say there was 9-10 is that my husband had seen some before I even got out there.  They all traveled from and to in the same direction.  Very strangeâ€¦ ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));41.479;-71.5327
