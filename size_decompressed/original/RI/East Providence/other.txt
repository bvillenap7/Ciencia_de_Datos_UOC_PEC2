I, along with my girlfriend, witnessed what I initially believed to be an aircraft at high altitude when it stopped moving, I realized it was of an altitude far too high for a rotary wing aircraft.  It was my girlfriend who noticed the 2nd craft. The sky was clear, and sunny and as the craft were illuminating a bright white light, that also appeared rather odd.;41.815;-71.3663
