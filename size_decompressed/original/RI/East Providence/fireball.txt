Red and blue light UFO over Cranston, Rhode Island, landing vertically in Narragansett Bay.;2015-07-25 00:48:00;3 minutes;Red and blue light UFO over Cranston, Rhode Island, landing vertically in Narragansett Bay. I had just got back from my local 24 hour gym and parked my car in front of my house, when I saw a strange looking object flying over what would be Warwick, and then Cranston, RI.   This object was emitting red and blue lights pulsating lights, not the standard red and green lights you would see on a helicopter or airplane.  This immediately caught my attention since I'm an Airline Pilot, and knew that blue lights should not be on an airplane.   I got out of my car to watch this thing and it started to move really fast and at 90 angles. Too fast to be a helicopter because I estimated it moved from atop of Cranston to over Narragansett Bay in less than 10 seconds.  Too fast for a helicopter.   But then it stopped in Mid Air and started moving down vertically for a landing somewhere over the water of Narragansett Bay.  Something that an airplane can't do either.   I took a pic of it but I'm afraid it looks like just another airplane because of the quality of my camera phone, and the distance from the object.  I had to have been 10 miles or more from this object the entire time. I'm still submitting a pic to the site to give a frame of reference.  I also made an attempt to video tape the object. but a street light got in the way, and the object was in the process of landing vertically out of sight, before I could get the frame in focus. ((NUFORCC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be quite serious-minded and objective, in his description of the event.  We suspect that he is an excellent witness, in all respects.  PD));41.815;-71.3663
