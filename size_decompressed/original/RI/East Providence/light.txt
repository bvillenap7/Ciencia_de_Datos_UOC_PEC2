Orange lights formation speed fast low multiple ufo.;2014-01-05 18:45:00;10 minutes;Orange lights formation speed fast low multiple ufo Huge formation of orange glowing lights stretching from the east horizon heading west as far as we could see!   Craft moved at dufferent rates of speed and generally in the same direction.  Best way to describe the sight was as if a volley of rockets or missled had been launched from the horizon into the air.   Was an amazing site to see and I believe I will never see anything like it again.. all of my neighbors were outside their houses cameras pointed to the sky recording the event.. there will be ALOT of pictures or videos based on the turnout just on my street.;41.815;-71.3663
A light went in a Z pattern and disappeared.;2014-06-03 00:33:00;5 seconds;A light went in a Z pattern and disappeared. I was driving with four people in my car when my passenger and myself saw a flash of life, much like a streetlight moving in a zig zag pattern across the sky.   Only two of us saw it, we logically tried to think of anything that it could have been, especially living close to an airport.  But nothing I could think of could have made a Z pattern in the sky and disappear so quickly.;41.815;-71.3663

For ~2 mins., a low lying bright amber covered light hovered in the sky and disappeared without moving and in the area of a/c.;2016-08-23 21:30:00;2 minutes;For about two minutes, a low lying bright amber covered light hovered in the sky and disappeared, without moving, and in the area of aircraft.  I looked out my window abnormal saw a low lying amber bright light, the appearance of foil. Airplanes were noticeable in the area.  The light almost shimmered but did not move.   I asked my husband to look at it and to ask what he thought it was.  He also had no idea.  Without moving, only shimmering the light disappeared.  I have no idea what that was, but I feel very uneasy.  It was not necessarily airplane.  It was low, large and bright with no sound.
