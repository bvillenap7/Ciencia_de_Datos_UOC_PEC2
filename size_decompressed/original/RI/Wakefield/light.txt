I witnessed this aproximately the same time in the morning last time. Both times I woke my husband because I couldn't believe my eyes.  They orginally looked like stars.  I thought because it was windy that the trees were making these 5 stars move.  However I went upstairs and these stars were in view way above the tree line.  These stars? Moved!?!  They moved up down and side to side ever so slightly.  The closer I looked at one and stared I could see below the light a blinking red light. One of them looked like it was a plane on its'typical flight path to the ocean, but then it stopped.  I even witnessed another red blinking light flying to each of these 5 moving stars. I thought that it was perhaps an airplane from quonset checking these out for the government, but then it went away.  It was a sighting that was in great length and wasn't brief.  My husband tha I awoke said it was a star, but then I made him stare and watch, and then he was freaked.  We see many airplanes and stars on our 5+ acres, but this definitely wasn't either.  It was quite frightening.  He didn't want me to watch anymore because we didn't want to invite any danger.;41.4443000000001;-71.5316999999999

It was a rather large blue/greenish light that glowed for several seconds as it moved and abruptly faded out, not to be seen again.   Two of us witnessed the very bright light move downward and across the sky as we drove.;41.4443000000001;-71.5316999999999
