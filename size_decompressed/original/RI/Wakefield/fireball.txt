So last night, I'm outside in my yard and I look up and see this orange light approaching from the western sky.  I point it out to my buddy. This thing is flying at about 1500 feet and moving at maybe 50 knots.  The damn thing gets within 10 degrees of directly overhead and it's clearly on fire.  We could see the flames dancing like on a yule log. It was silent.  The winds were dead calm and we were both sober as judges.  The thing continued east for about four minutes before burning out over Rhode Island Sound.
