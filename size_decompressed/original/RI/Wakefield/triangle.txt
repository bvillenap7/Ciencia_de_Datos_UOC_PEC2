Approximately 10 pm, we were driving on Route 1 South in Wakefield.  We noticed a large object with 4 large white circle lights kind of hovering over the air.  The two of us both saw it at the same time and approximately 5 seconds after we spotted it, the 4 white lights went off and one of the lights turned green.  Then all lights disappeared and the 4 white lights came on again.  Although it looked like a rectangle from the side, when it started moving at a very fast rate, we saw it actually looke dlike a triangle.  It started to go over some trees then just completely disappeared.;41.4443000000001;-71.5316999999999
Bight ball of light in the sky trailed by a more diffuse morphing cloud of light.  ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));2009-09-19 20:10:00;1minute;There was a bight ball of light in the sky trailed by a more diffuse morphing cloud of light and then it was extinguished. There was a very bright circle of light in the southern sky a little smaller than a dime.  At first I thought it was an airplane headlight, but then I realized that the triangular beam of light was behind and slightly above the ball and not in front of it as an airplane head lamp would be.  The diffuse beam behind the bright ball began to change shape.  For about a second it was heart shaped and then more triangularagain.  It looked as though it was passing through a cloud, but the sky was cloudless.  The ball of light in the front went out and then within about 30 seconds the entire thing was gone from the sky. There was no associated sound or explosion, no falling debris. Don't think it was necessarily a space ship, but it was definitely unlike anything that I have ever seem. Very curious..
