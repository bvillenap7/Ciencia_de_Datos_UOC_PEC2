Moved slowly, we ran outside in excitement but it had started moving away from the house.  It was large but not sure of exact size.;41.9853;-71.5183999999999

This sighting that occured was the most frightening.  I was looking out of my window when I saw the bright lights in a tree on the side of my home.  At the same time a dog started barking.   This light changed shape from a diamond to a circle.   There was no sound other then branches breaking.  Also there was a blue amd white color coming from the bottom I watched it slowley move towards the side of my house.  This light was hovering and I was blinded by the light.   It hovered for 15 minutes and i was able to grab my camera.  I took a sequence of photos in which shows the exact movements.  After i took the photos it vanished.;41.9853;-71.5183999999999
