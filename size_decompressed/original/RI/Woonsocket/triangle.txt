It was very dark and we we're standing on the back porch.  First we saw a triangular object not moving but with white lights coming down in an angled line on each side.  It was also flashing or changing colored lights in the body of the object.   We hurried and got the camera but the object was so far away you can't really see anything.  As we we're watching we saw a similar object hover by slowly in the same area but the first one didn't move.  After a few minutes the first one start slowly moving but it was so slow.  When the lights flashed it was so triangular like shaped on both objects and not like a plane.  I have never seen anything like that before.  We got in the car to drive to see if we could get a better view. We did see lots of planes in the area as well but nothing like the objects.  These were spotted in the west direction.   When we got back to the house the objects were gone.   There were no sounds coming from them either.;41.9853;-71.5183999999999
