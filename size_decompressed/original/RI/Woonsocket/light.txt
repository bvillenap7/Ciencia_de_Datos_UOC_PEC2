At first it caught my eyes because the circular light was shifting its lights around, something like turning on another light source on the bottom of the object and then off, just for a second or so, and then remain a steady single light[fire orange] that was a perfect circle, moving north from woonsocket,RI. to blackstone,MA. very slowly and seemed to slowdown just a bit, here and there,,,it was a steady stright line path without any noise going from south to north.;41.9853;-71.5183999999999
