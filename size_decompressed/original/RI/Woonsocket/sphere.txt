Orange sphere than blinking lights to slow down craft until stopped.  ((anonymous report));2012-05-09 09:15:00;5 minutes;Orange sphere than blinking lights to slow down craft until stopped I've wrote this on this site many times and just having it removed.... I came outside at 9 15 p.m. to see a large orange sphere falling fast [ONLY 3 houses away from us stright up] when suddenly 7 very white,very bright WHITE[ very WHITE] lights came on under the craft blinking very fast, then the craft slowed and as the craft slowed the blinking lights slowed , and slowed until full hover above a house [only 3 houses away ,about 10 feet above the house and just hovered there for 5 min. then slowly moved to due North to a military base 5 miles away...  THIS was OBVIOUSLY LIFE..  LIGHT tech.. is going to be our future... I think this is U.S.A. gov. tech..Not alien..  This was just so much more than just seeing a light moving this is something that takes brains to make and ride in, what else came turn on blinking light to slow down a craft.........besides us 5 people, others seen this all over the city ,somebody wrote it here too,but, that is also deleted;41.9853;-71.5183999999999

My CRAFT was light tech...7 white lights came on blinking very fast [as the craft decended, very fast,,then the craft slowed down with these lights] I believe its USA , with LIGHT TECH, from where they found it will never know.];41.9853;-71.5183999999999

Orange orb moving in the sky silently.;2013-08-16 20:15:00;2 minutes;Orange Orb moving in the sky Silently Hi,my son was outside already when I went out, and he tells me, I just seen a orange ball floating around I said to him Where do you see it and he pointed up in the sky at a big clowd and said. It was just under the cloud and went that way until it disappear into the clouds...I was like WOW!  I looked all around to see if there was anything else that was outside the clouds that may be with what my son seen....I had no doubt that my son seen something very unusual for him to tell me about it,,,when suddenly my son says, look there it is again, pointing to the same direction as the first one he seen,,I look up and sure enough there is a deep orange [FLYING] ball/sphere just slowly moving around like without a [care in the world] on who can see it.  It moved like a ball on the ocean just weaving and bobbing along in one direction fron the East to SW and then S and out of sight.. When I first seen it, it wa! s or seened much larger than when I GOT my Butt to go get my camera I bought just for this REASON, [After my First sighting in 5/19/12 MOST awesomest and VERY informative sighting 3 houses away at roof height,  NOTHING will ever be awesome as that, and I had no CAMERA]] So I did get about 2 minutes of this Orange Sphere until out of sight..No sounds at all and was very clear to see because of the dark skys.   Oh, this ORB was ONLY the size of a large BASKETBALL,,,HOW??.  I have seen a Asteroid come right towards me and a friend coming home from work at 2:00A.M. and went just to my left VERY low to EARTH, this was a Giant fireball with crackling noise], That was one of the most Incredable sights I have ever seen back in Winter time in 1991-92....Since I have been a sky watcher and Very good at describing what I see without exaggerating or getting to and over excited, my Dad trained me since I was young to Always be aware of your surrounds,, and he was always a ufo believer, so , I've always liked up to see what Strange and unusual! things I can see in the sky..  I've see and understand airplanes flights and all its ways of flight, there are about a dozen flights paths in the skys over head from me,, so I know what planes are...I will give video if theres a way.....;41.9853;-71.5183999999999
2 Orange balls that have came out of cloud and moved west slilently...Second time I seen,1 in front of me,above a home.;2014-06-21 20:03:00;1 1/2;2 Orange balls that have came out of cloud and moved west silently...Second time I seen, 1 in front of me, above a home. My son seen the first one, he said, I seen a red light moving across the sky,  I figured it might have been a firework, but, 3 minutes later, it came back in the same spot my son seen the first one [thats why I'm not sure if its the same one or another] At first it looked like it was on first, thats when I ran in my house to get my camera and got 1minute+15 seconds, of a fire/orange ball, that made no sound and moved slowly....;41.9853;-71.5183999999999
