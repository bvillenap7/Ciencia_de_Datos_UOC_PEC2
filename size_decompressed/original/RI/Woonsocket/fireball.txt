A bright red circle/light/fireball in the sky that didn't blink and suddenly disappeared.;2013-08-03 22:40:00;~3 minutes;A bright red circle/light/fireball in the sky that didn't blink and suddenly disappeared. My friends, one of my cousins, and I were walking our friend to her work, which is approximately a half a mile away from my house.  As we were nearing the exit of my neighborhood, we all saw a red light in the shape of a circle, the easiest way to describe it would be a fireball. (Like the ones everyone have been reporting, it seems.)   At first we thought it was a comet or meteor of some sort, but comets and meteors usually leave trails if I'm correct. The ball of red light was a lot slower than a meteor, but it was slightly faster than a plane or helicopter.  It wasn't blinking, the light was constant. We watched it for approximately three minutes until it suddenly faded away, but I saw an outline around a transparent circle. The ball didn't seem like the fireballs described by other people, though. My friend who was going to work, my cousin and I are only upcoming sophomores in high school.  My other friend is an upcoming junior in high school, but my cousin is supposed to be a junior. There are two females and one male between us.  I was terrified, and I've been feeling paranoid ever since we've gotten home from the walk.;41.9853;-71.5183999999999
