At first they were stationary, but then they started moving back and forth and diagonal to each other, sometimes with great speed.  They appeared brighter than a star or planet. It Â was very mesmerizing to watch, because we had never seen airplanes move that way.  Helicopters don't move that fast. We checked the UFO reporting site, and checked with friends.  One friend in Rumford, RI saw a stationary object brighter than a planet in the eastern sky, but nothing moving.  But she was driving and couldn't take her eyes off the road to get a good view of it.  She said points of light were coming off the object in two places, and it was brighter than a planet.;41.8417;-71.3516
An apparent shooting star that had a U-shaped trajectory.;2014-12-14 04:33:00;2 seconds;An apparent shooting star that had a U-shaped trajectory. I was having a cup of coffee at my kitchen table, and went out to look at the stars. I found the Big Dipper and was looking at that.  Suddenly a white light, a little larger than a star, streaked  across the whole Big Dipper and disappeared.   I would've thought it was a shooting star, but its path swerved down and then up during its flight, as if to dodge an object.  The swerve was quite pronounced.  I have no measuring tool except the constellation itself, by which to measure the swerve.  It took up about one eighth of the size of the constellation.   Of the other shooting stars I have seen have had a straight path.  It vanished.;41.8417;-71.3516

They looked like stars or fireflies, in terms of size, but very far away and extremely bright,  brighter than stars.  They could be seen in the peripheral vision, which picks up light and motion better than straight-on vision does.;41.8417;-71.3516
