Chevron shaped object seen in Rhode Island sky on night of Vernal Equinox.;2001-03-20 19:30:00;30 seconds;Chevron shaped object seen in Rhode Island sky on night of Vernal Equinox. Observed by my husband (((deleted)) year old ((deleted)) for local city government) and myself (deleted)) at approximately 19:30 on March 20, 2001.  We were in the hottub in our backyard just doing some general stargazing.  The sky was very clear with a full blanket of stars.  Local aircraft traffic is prominent. This was not like that traffic. For less than 30 seconds an object appeared, chevron in shape, with (I believe) 6 unblinking lights along the perimeter.  From my perspective it appeared in the night sky to be a hand's breadth and length.  It moved swiftly and straight from the east-south-east to the north-north-west.;41.5964;-71.2565
