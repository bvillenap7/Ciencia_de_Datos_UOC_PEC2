Vary large glowing object with a red blinking light beneath the bright round yellow/orange glowing light;2003-03-16 21:00:00;five minutes;Vary large glowing object with a red blinking light beneath the bright round yellow/orange glowing light I saw the object from our home in Rhode Island. We have an unobstructed view of the Eastern sky looking from Aquidneck Island towards Tiverton, RI. I first saw the object's light coming from the South and heading North.  It caught my attention because the object was so bright and was moving slower than most aircraft I've seenm.  Using binoculars I was unable to distinguish what kind of aircraft it was.  It moved North and then appeared to hover and then move east, I lost it in the evening clouds over Fogland. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));41.5964;-71.2565

It looked like something caught fire almost.  This lasted 45 secs.  About 15 seconds later a second bright light appears, circles around in the same spot and then disapers into the night once again.  It was one of the strangest things ive seen in the night sky.  I'm stumped at what it could be.;41.5964;-71.2565
