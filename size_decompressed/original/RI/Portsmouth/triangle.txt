At first the object appeared to be a bright, slow moving plane. However, at closer and more precise inspection we noticed that it was changing direction quite frequently and at times seemed to almost hover. We followed it as it flew over a few farms (most had no produce, one had some livestock). At one point the craft flew very close to our vehicle (say, about 1000ft overhead) and you could clearly see two blinking white lights, a solid blue light and a solid red light ( one of each color in each corner and a white one in the middle). Eventually the craft flew directly over the airport behind Oliphant Lane,(this is when we became skeptical thinking it was a plane, however), it flew very low towards the landing strip but then immediately changed direction very quickly and headed back towards the farms where it almost appeared to land. It seemed as though it was surveying something. After about 5 more minutes the craft began to fly high west into the night sky until it was out of view.;41.5964;-71.2565
