At least 4 kite-shaped bright, stationary objects over Portsmouth, RI.;2016-07-05 21:46:00;continuous;at least 4 kite-shaped bright, stationary objects over Portsmouth, RI I see at least 4 kite-shaped objects, as if they had a small tail, in the sky.  Not blinking, and not moving.  Some very bright, some smaller and less bright.  Looking with the naked eye, they appeared to be one (star) color then with binoculars, they seem to be mostly star colored, but with 3 or 4 bright yellowish-orangey orbs on their lower portions.   Friends feel they are not stars because they are not blinking, and not satellites because they are not moving.  I had only seen one at first, and the other people who saw it thought it might be a planet, but the shape is like a diamond/kite pattern, so doesn't look like a planet to me.   We are all lay-observers, but often look at the night sky as we are on boats in a marina, with few lights disturbing the view.;41.5964;-71.2565
