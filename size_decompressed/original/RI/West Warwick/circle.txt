I was viewing the nite sky thru my skylite window when a large bright circular object with a define ring of about twelve flashing red and white lights suddenly appeared.  It seemed to zigzag right to left. I woke my husband up and he confirmed what I was viewing, at this time it seemed to becoming straight towards us. It was now very large.  Suddenly, it took a sharp, straight left turn and disappeared from view.;41.701;-71.5194

It was lit up all around in green flashing lights and one huge yellow light in the middle of it.  It took of extremely fast followed by another aircraft that looked exactly like it following this unidentifed flying object.  It was extrmely insane because they were both so huge and neither of them made a noise.  They were traveling extremely fast and went pretty far but the lights were so bright we could still see them.  They then shot into the air and the yellow light that wa sin the middle of it got tinier and tinier until it dissapered.;41.701;-71.5194
