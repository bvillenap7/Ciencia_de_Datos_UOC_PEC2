12 White Circles stationary in different formations for 10 to 15 min.;2000-10-08 16:00:00;15 Min;12 White Circles stationary in different formations for 10 to 15 min. While sitting in my step son's yard he told me to look up to check out the sky. We saw what at first appeared to be about a dozen white balloons that were released and floating across the sky.  As they drifted to the right some of them paired off and I have never seen balloons do that.  My step-son went for a pair of binoculars and returned with the only pair he could find which were a children's pair which did us no good at all.  By this time four or five of the objects went behind some clouds so we determined they were to big and far away for balloons.  The seven that were left formed into a triangle, a vertical row of three and a vertical row of two and stayed stationary for a few minutes.  I went into the house and got my wife and daughter-in-law.  We all saw the objects stay in the same formation for about another five minutes.  My daughter-in-law went next door to borrow another pair of binoculars and we watched her leave.  When we looked back up the objects were gone and did not reappear.;41.701;-71.5194
