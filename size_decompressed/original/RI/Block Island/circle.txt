My two cousins, boyfriend and I decided to go to the beach this afternoon.  After some delay, we made it, but the sun was close to setting.   We played a game of frisbee and ran the dogs to warm up, then my younger cousin and I decided to jump in the ocean before it got too late.  A few minutes after we had gotten settled, I saw something out of the corner of my eye.  It was a pink, circular object floating through the air, it seemed as though it were halfway between us and the mainland (we live on an island).   So- it appeared, about 40 degrees above the horizon, the craft being no more than five degrees across, went left (north) in a straight line for about five seconds and then all the sudden zigzagged back and forth (forward and back) a bit and then dropped straight into the ocean and disappeared.   As soon as it was gone, I looked to my cousin, standing five feet away from me, and asked him if he had seen it as well.  He had.   I called back to my boyfriend and other ! cousin on the shore, but neither of them had seen the event  I don't known how he dogs reacted- we were mesmerized until it was over.  I don't believe it sped up or slowed down at all, it moved very smoothly and consistently through the sky, and just dropped straight down into the water, but at the rate it was moving across the horizon it must have been moving very quickly.;41.1685;-71.5722
