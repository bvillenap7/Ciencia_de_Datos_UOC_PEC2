There were people on the side of the road taking pictures.  I would like to know what they were and I have beeb watching the news and going on the computer to see what it was.  It was amazing to see this. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));41.6927056338029;-71.5728774647886

A red light was flashing from them so they were not stars.   They all started to move and suddenly disappeared.;41.6927056338029;-71.5728774647886
