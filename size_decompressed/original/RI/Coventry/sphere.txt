Bright white light travels across the night sky and vanishes.;2013-11-29 20:00:00;1-1.5 seconds;Bright white light travels across the night sky and vanishes Friday, November 29th, 2013.   I was traveling south on Hopkins Hill in Coventry, RI, at approximately 8PM.   I was following a car driven by my wife with my daughter in the front passenger seat and her friend in the back.  The skies were extremely clear.   A bright white light came into view to my right at a slight angle upwards but well over the tree tops.  It moved very fast to the right and vanished.  Total sighting time may have been 1 to 1.5 seconds. I can’t be sure how far it travelled before it disappeared, but it was a good distance across the sky.  It didn’t make any sound that I could detect being in the car, and it did not leave any type of vapor trail that I could tell.  I cannot be sure how big it was only that it had to be substantial to give off that much light. When we reached our home on Mohawk Trail in West Greenwich, RI, my daughter ran from my wife’s car to ask if I had seen it and I told her I had.  My wife had also seen it but not my daughter’s friend in the back seat.   Later that evening, I mentioned the sighting to my neighbor who said that he had also seen a bright white light go across the sky while he was standing in his front yard.  He confirmed it to be right around 8PM.  He described its movement the same as we did, it seemed to appear move across the sky and vanished very quickly and made no sound.  The way he described it, it would have been travelling east to west in the sky.;41.6927056338029;-71.5728774647886
