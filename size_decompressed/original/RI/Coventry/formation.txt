red orbs 'dancing' around a central orb;1976-05-01 20:00:00;3min;red orbs 'dancing' around a central orb Since my sighting was nearly thirty years ago,my recollection is somewhat fuzzy,but i shall do my best to describe my experience. I and my 2 year-old son had gone shopping at K-MART.Upon leaving the shopping center i approached and stopped at a stop light.While waiting for the light to change,i observed a round red light approximately 100 feet above and behind the stop light.While looking at the light,it instantly became three red lights,which seemed to dance(for lack of a better word)around one another.The 'dance' seeemed to be well choreographed,one red light was stationary in a center position while two lights manouvered up,down,around,behind and in front of the center light.Then the two 'dancing' lights merged with the central light and were gone.That's it gone,no sudden taking off,no streaking of lights, just POOF, gone. All this seemed to occur within a 30 to 45 second time span,as the light changed from red to green.However,my observace of this spectacle, in my mind,was at least 3 to 5 minutes. As i recovered my senses,taking off from the light,i had an inner dialogue with myself, trying to reconcile what i knew i saw to what i thought could not be.Although i lived just one mile from K-MART,i passed up my house and went to my parent's home fifteen miles away.I didn't know why, i only knew i did not want to be alone.I was wired,i mean i was so up,so jittery,so energetic i could not be still. Once i was seated with Mom,i was immediately calm,even mellow.I had not recounted my sighting,but as we chatted,a replay of my sighting was constantly going through my mind,sort of like background music.I wanted and intended to tell Mom what i had experienced,however,i never did .I don't know why,it was an eerie feeling,my sighting being foremost on my mind and not speaking of it.Why was that???????? I know to this day that what i saw was real and not of this world.I sure would like to know if anyone out there has experienced similar sightings. My sighting occurred summer of '76 in Coventry,R.I.

It was scary!;2002-04-10 09:00:00;00:37;It was scary! It looked like f/a-18 super hornet, but was to fast to be anything Earthly. It also made a strange noise like noise from the ground was reflecting off the formation of ufos. Then a bang was heard and they disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous.

a triangle formation of crafts;2003-10-03 12:50:00;1 minute;a triangle formation of crafts my young daughter kept yelling -see mama, plane- as we heard a plane and saw it off in the distance, i scanned the clear blue sky and noticed in another direction VERY FAR off 6-7 craft in a perfectly straight angle line and then starting at 1 or 2 craft down the line was another line of 4-5 craft in a perfectly straight line.  i had never noticed such an odd formation of craft(i am always looking up to the sky)i watched for about a minute, as they did not appear to move, then walked quickly to my front door only 5 feet or so away to grab my digital camera which was inside right by the door, it only took 10 seconds or so and as soon as i came out with my camera they were nowhere to be seen.;41.6927056338029;-71.5728774647886
