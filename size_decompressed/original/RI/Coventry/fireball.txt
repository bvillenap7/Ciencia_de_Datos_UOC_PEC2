The object then stopped in mid-air and turned into this orange fireball.   Then another one appeared to the southwest of the first one.  They both just hovered.  No noise.  I noticed that it was very cloudy this night as I did not want to confuse these objects for planets.   As I was reaching for my camera phone, a long streak of light came down from the sky.  Assuming it was a meteor.  Had nothing to do with the balls of fire in the night sky.  It shot down approx. 100 feet in front of me into the woods.  A few minutes later, the balls of fire headed East then disappeared.   I did take a picture and there is an unexplained light in it;41.6927056338029;-71.5728774647886
