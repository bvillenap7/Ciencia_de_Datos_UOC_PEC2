Strange lights sighted above tree line just before sunrise;2019-12-19 06:15:00;2 minutes;Strange lights sighted above tree line just before sunrise On the morning of December 19, 2019 between 6:00 and 6:30 am EST, I was sitting at my kitchen table looking out the sliding glass door towards the southeast when I saw two lights resembling car headlights hovering just above the tree line.  The lights were whitish blue and slightly oblong horizontally.  I checked every possible cause for these lights (reflection, car headlights, streetlights) and could not explain them. I watched them for approximately two minutes and then I got the feeling that I was being observed.  As soon as I had that thought, the lights shut off like someone flipped a switch.  They didnâ€™t shoot off into the sky or slowly fade.  I am 60 years old and have never seen anything like that in my life!;41.6927056338029;-71.5728774647886
