Me and my family were driving home from the showcase theater, approx. 5pm on RT.95 south (right near SUPER WALMART exit 7)and there were 2 objects in the sky.  They were about 3 miles apart, and they were creating a missile shaped tail.  They were just sitting there one looked like it was traveling east < and the other looked like it was shooting up ^ but it was getting closer and closer to the ground. We took a picture of them on the cell phone, but it is very small.   This was not a plane. I have never seen anything like it.  I know there had to be others who were traveling on 95 south who saw this. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

A light over Rhode Island for more than 10 days.  ((NUFORC Note:  If the time is p.m., we suspect Venus.  PD));2013-11-23 17:30:00;days;A light over Rhode Island for more than 10 days My office, my partner, and our boys, have all been watching this light since November 15, 2013.  It is mostly over eth airport.  A light sitting, no movement, lower than planes. But shines like a huge light.   What I found most interesting is that other people are noticing it and talking about it. ((NUFORC Note:  If the time is p.m., we suspect Venus.
