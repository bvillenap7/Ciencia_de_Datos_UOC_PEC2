Looked at first like airplane landing lights.  Then it moved rapidly in random directions.  Moved laterally and up and down in a way an airplane could not move.  Moved much too fast to be a helicopter.  Was in the Northwest sky about 35 degrees above the horizon.  Upon inspection with binoculars, craft had one large amber light that had constant brightness.  Another large amber light had varying degrees of brigtness.  Craft also had a red blinking light.  It would hover for a few minutes and then rapidly dart about and hover again.  It gradually seemed to be moving away from our vantage point, disappearing behind the tree line after about 45 minutes.

Quickly Growing White Light in Rhode Island;2007-07-06 21:20:00;60 seconds;Quickly Growing White Light in Rhode Island Facing NNW about 55-degrees above horizon. Small very dim light traveling at a steady pace from west to east. About ten seconds into my observing its travel, it stopped and suddenly became very bright and white. It started growing into about the size of a quarter held at arms length. This lasted about 5 seconds. It then receded in brightness and returned to its dim state and continued traveling at its previous pace. Eventually it disappeared about 20 seconds later because of city light pollution I couldn't follow it any more.

Two white dots crossing paths around Lincoln and Providence RI.;2013-10-01 12:40:00;4 seconds;Two white dots crossing paths around Lincoln and Providence RI. I was driving along Route 146 going South near the exit for the Lincoln Mall.   Two small, bright lights were low in the sky, heading on a path to cross each other at an angle.   One going up at a 45 degree angle, one going down at a 45 degree angle.  After they passed each other it took about 1 second for them to disappear.;41.9073;-71.4351

Only saw it for maybe a sec.  Until it was too far away.   What makes me think about and even report this is that me and my father were working earlier during the day maybe around 11:00 and 4 us fighter jets came extremely low in formation over my house and that is the first time it has ever happened.  They were going almost in the exact direction that I saw the light originate from.   Never posted before but this was real.  I know what it was I have seen many comets and shooting stars this was no where even close to that.;41.9073;-71.4351
