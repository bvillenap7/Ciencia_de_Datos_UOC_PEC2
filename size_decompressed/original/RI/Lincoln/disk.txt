I was looking out my bedroom window when i saw across the street a bright white light behind  some trees. It was to left side of my neighbors house (from my point of view) and was almost down to the ground.  So I know it couldn't be a star or plane and I know it wasn't a car because you can't see the road behind my neighbors house from window behind the trees. So I watched it and it started rising in a diagonal moving left.  It went behind the trees and came out into clear view. It was going faster than a plane so I didn't have to time to check it out with my telescope so I used my binoculars. It was a disk shape. The bottom of it was just a big white light but around the perimeter was a single strip of colored lights blinking on and off in a pattern. It went out of view for a second but turned around and started moving right. But it was farther away now and it went behind some trees in the distance. (not next to my neighbors) I tried to keep an eye on it but it got smaller and smaller until finally it disappeared and I never saw it come out of the other side of the trees.;41.9073;-71.4351
