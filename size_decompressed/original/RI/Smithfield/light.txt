After ;2001-07-15 04:30:00;5 minutes;First noticed what appeared to be a very brilliant star in the western sky, reddish colored, like the planet Mars might appear.  After staring at this for about a minute, I noticed that the star was moving against the background of the night sky and other stars.  It did not have any flashing or pulsing lights, as might be seen on an airplane.  It had a steady and slow trajectory and was moving East from the western sky, but it was not moving even as fast as one might expect to see an airplane move.  It moved in its course in a straight line directly overhead and eventually disappeared into the eastern sky in about 5 minutes.  It appeared brightest from its first appearance in the West and then diminshed in brightness as it moved away into the East.;41.8979;-71.5165
