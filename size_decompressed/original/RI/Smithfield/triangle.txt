Red and Green blinking aircrafts flying fast and low;2006-07-16 22:00:00;15 minutes;Red and Green blinking aircrafts flying fast and low My boyfriend and I were walking outside to my car around 10 pm when we saw in the sky a large aircraft flying low and moving quickly.  It was blinking red and green lights very brightly.  We found it strange and continued watching.  We noticed that there were many more (apprx 6 others) flying at farther distances all going in different directions.  We could tell they were moving incredibly quickly because there was a normal plane in the sky and the strange blinking crafts flew straight past it (we thought they were going to crash) and was out of our sight range in a matter of seconds.  There was even one or two large crafts (flying low and quickly) that had a strobe light effect and were incredibly bright.  We are sure about what we saw and we found it very strange.;41.8979;-71.5165
Triangular lighted shape in the sky around 5 pm;2012-01-15 17:00:00;5 minutes;Triangular lighted shape in the sky around 5 pm I was on my way to work in Lincoln, R.I. and I looked up in the sky and I witnessed a triangular figure outlined in lights in the sky.  There were six lights in the shape of a triangle and it was moving with my car like how the moon moves with your car not how a plane moves with your car.  I'm not sure if any other people saw it, but people in front of me were braking and one person turned into a gas station and parked their car, so I'm not sure if they saw it also.   The object ended up going in the back of me so I wasn't able to see it again, but I know for a fact it was not a plane or an outline of stars, as it was only 5 pm.;41.8979;-71.5165
