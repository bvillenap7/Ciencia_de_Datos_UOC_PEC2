3 arrow shaped objects brown in color flying in a triangular formation moving very quickly.;2006-10-25 23:50:00;10 seconds;3 arrow shaped objects brown in color flying in a triangular formation moving very quickly As i was looking up at the sky, stargazing 3 arrow shaped objects flying very closely in a triangular formation flew directly over me on a right to left angle. They traveled very quickly, and if I was to guess I would say at least 2000mph and maybe around 2 to 5 miles up. They went right over providence airport and were a dull brown in color and made no noise. Also, there were no lights visible and it was a crystal clear night. The body and the (wings)were proportionally the same size. All 3 parts of each craft were the same color. Almost like if you put 3 pencils on a table and made an arrow shape. The 3rd craft on right rear flank strayed off slightly to right towards the end of the sighting. Also, A collegue of mine spotted 3 lights on the same night around an hour earlier but was driving around 15 miles north of me towards my direction. The 3 lights formed a triangular formation. We both drive for a living and we both have never seen anything like this. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

I knew it was not the moon because it began to move, while still moving through the sky I noticed the light went out.  then the craft came towards us, as it got closer, I could make out three dim lights on the bottom of the triangular shape with no distinct wings or features. we could at this point tell it was not an aircraft or drone.  as the craft flew past I could hear a quiet hum. the craft was about the size of a small fighter plane. then it flew off into the distance.;41.7149042857143;-71.4116592857143
