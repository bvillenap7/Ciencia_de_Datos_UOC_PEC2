Bright flat object moved upwards and disapeared behind cloads.;1998-10-15 18:00:00;5min;Bright flat object moved upwards and disapeared behind cloads. I was at Shaws Lakewood (a supermarket) when i was walking towards the west I saw a object. I thought first it was a plane becuase it was flat,and the light looked not like a light but more like sunlight reflecting off chrome. The reflection was the brightest yellow i have ever seen,just like the sun.The object stayed still for about 3 minutes then went upwards at a speed not to fast,but faster than a normal plane that would fly in the area.(Small planes at tf green airport -planes dont travel vertical).The object continued upwards for about 7 seconds and disapeared behind a cload.I kept looking towards the cload every 5 min and could not find the object.(If it was a plane it would have made itself visible after it exited the cloud.;41.7149042857143;-71.4116592857143
Large bright white UFO releasing smaller red/orange UFOs;2005-12-14 23:00:00;~1 hour;Large bright white UFO releasing smaller red/orange UFOs. I got out of bed to use the bathroom around 11pm-midnight in mid December 2004, and, while looking out the third story bathroom window (looking towards Rt 2, which is about 2 miles away), I noticed a strange (and very large) white plasma like light on the horizon (cigar/eye shape).  Due to its location on the horizon and apparent size, I estimate the object to have been 300-600 feet in length.  It was moving from my left to right very slowly, in a relatively straight line, but in a strange non-linear way (i.e. it appeared to skip/teleport forward).   After watching the object for about 5–10 minutes, it stopped moving and multiple orange/reddish spherical objects (much smaller) were released from the top/center of the larger white object.  I saw a few of these orange/red balls moving through the woods (they appeared to be searching for something or just gathering info), and one flew over my house (pretty close too, probably about 200–300 feet above).  It appeared to be more of a bucky ball shape (more like a boxy sphere), around 10–20 feet in diameter, and metallic, with multiple red/orange lights.  It made no noise at all and appeared to just slowly float by and slowly rotate in random directions.   After about 30 minutes, the smaller orange/red objects made their way back to the much large white plasma object (mother ship?) and re-entered through the top/center.  The large white object then continued moving from left to right (going roughly in the north direction) similar to how it was moving before it stopped, but slightly faster, until it was out of sight.   The sighting lasted for 45 minutes to an hour.   The next morning, the sky was covered in criss-cross streaks (commonly referred to as “Chem-Trails”), more than I had ever seen, even up to the present day (almost 13 years later). ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date is approximate.

Please make that correction if you can. Thanks!  ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM #1)) ((ADDENDUM #2 FROM WITNESS)) Hi Peter,  Thank you for the quick reply. I was thinking about it last night and my date may actually be wrong (it might have been Dec 2005 or even 2006 - I'll confirm with my mom - i know it was the final December before we moved out of my old house after my fathers death).  I'll confirm the date with her and email you back asap.  I came to the site mainly to see if anyone had reported a similar siting (as i find it unlikely that no one else would have seen that!).  The morning after the event the only person I spoke to about it was my mom and she thought I was crazy, on drugs, or possibly dreaming (i was not).   After being dismissed by my mom i kinda just brushed it off and put it on the back burner for a while.  I didn't really hear of these UFO reporting sites till later on, and even once I did, I was kind of embarrassed to talk about it/report it.  I feel like it makes me a crazy conspiracy theorist to other normal people and being labeled as a conspiracy theorist in my line of work (Engineering in the Biotech/Pharma industry) is almost like a death sentence to your career (more so conspiracy theories pertaining to natural health solutions though - such as articles from Mercola.com or alternative news such as Infowars.com, Drudgereport.com, etc). Anyway, thank you for taking me seriously and not making me feel crazy.  I'll email you back as soon as i hear back from my mom to confirm the date and i'd be happy to answer any more questions or help the cause in anyway. Thanks again,  ((END ADDENDUM #2)) ((ADDENDUM #3 FROM WITNESS)) Hi Peter,  I just confirmed that it was mid December (around the 14th) of 2005, not 2004. Sorry for the error! i'll look through the reports around that date and see if anyone did in fact report seeing something similar. Thanks / take care, ((END ADDENDUM #3));41.7149042857143;-71.4116592857143
Black bell kiowa sightings over 95;2012-02-05 14:00:00;8 minutes;Black bell kiowa sightings over 95 Heading southbound on RT. 95 at the RT. 4 split, a black helicopter was hovering over the highway.  Approximately 150 ft above the blacktop.  I was driving under it while engaged in visual contact the entire time.   Upon passing it, the helo re-positioned its AOA and began traveling parallel to 95 in a SSE direction.   Upon exiting the highway at exit 7 (center of New England blvd.), the aircraft maintained location.   I parked my vehicle in the super Walmart parking lot and observed the black helicopter continue its path at low speed in a SSE direction.  No identifying markings for a news station or sheriffs dept. where on the aircraft, only a yellow N number on the tail. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to provide no contact information.
