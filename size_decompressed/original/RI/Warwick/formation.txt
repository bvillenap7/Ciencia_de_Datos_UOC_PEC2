Silent orange lights in formation.;2013-09-10 23:00:00;10 minutes;Silent orange lights in formation. It was a cloudy night, no stars or moon at approximately 11 pm.   From the south, I noticed 3 orange lights in a triangular shape moving silently to the ENE.  It was followed by a line of orange lights in a single file formation.   I called my husband and 2 other family members out to observe.  The lights did not blink there was no sound.   We watched until they disappeared from view (about 10 minutes).;41.7149042857143;-71.4116592857143
