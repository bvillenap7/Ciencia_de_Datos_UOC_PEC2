We saw two slow moving triangle formations.;2015-10-10 20:00:00;2-3 minutes;We saw two slow moving triangle formations. We were on 95, headed south, at the Airport Rd exit.  We saw two distinct triangle/pyramid light formations.  They appeared to at first be hovering but then began to look like they were moving slowly northward in unison.  One formation vanished and the other one's light intensity faded out but continued moving northward.  It maintained a triangle formation but the distance between each of the lights expanded.  Once they got past us, they were more spread out but still maintained a triangle formation.  We heard no sound from them.  I called the Warwick police who said they had not received any reports and told me to call the RI State Police.  When I called them, I was told that they had not had any other reports but that they would send a trooper out to the location where we saw them.  They also suggested that since it was near the airport, it was probably just some airplanes.  But we also saw regular airplanes flying in the vicinity at the time and the other! lights did not look anything like airplanes (or helicopters).  If someone from your agency feels the need to contact us regarding what we saw, please feel free to do so but it is not necessary unless you as the experts think it is.  :-);41.7149042857143;-71.4116592857143
