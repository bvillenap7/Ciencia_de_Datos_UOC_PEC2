I saw a fast moving, brightly lit, huge object, within 25 ft of me for half an hour.;1976-07-12 18:01:00;30 min;I saw a fast moving, brightly lit, huge object, within 25 ft of me for half an hour. It was around 8PM and I took a drive down to a local park, to sit by the ocean. It was a hot night and there wasnt any wind. I was alone, but there was two other cars parked near me with people sitting inside. Off in a distance I saw a bunch of bright lights coming closer. The object darted suddenly up and down and sideways. There was red and green lights all around the base of the object, which flashed on and off. The object was moving extremely fast, and within a few minutes was within 40 ft. of my car. I look in total shock as I had a very clear view of the object, which looked like nothing Ive ever seen before. It stood in the sky maybe 75 ft. high and 40ft away from my car and just stayed there, totally silent. It looked made of metal, and was very shiny. It was weird shaped, and didnt look as if its huge size could fly, as there was no wings, like an airplane. Some white lights started to flash, brightly. I got out of my car and walked towards the object. I was within 25ft of it and it just stayed where it was. I knew at this time, it wasnt from Earth, but I felt no fear. Maybe 30 minutes passed as I stood there. Then all of a sudden it went straight up and enormous speed and went sideways and totally vanished within 5 seconds. As I drove away from the area, I looked into the other cars parked there with me, and saw very shocked faces inside. Later in my life, Ive seen many more sightings, but never saw this particular object again. I'd be willing to take a lie detector test! I'm also willing to be contacted by a researcher using email. I might also note, Im not sure of the actual date this sighting happened, as it was many years ago, but I'll never forget it!

Cigar shaped craft captured in photo off the coast of Oakland Beach RI;2018-02-18 18:15:00;2 minutes;Cigar shaped craft captured in photo off the coast of Oakland Beach RI I was taking photos with my Canon DSLR camera.  Shutter speed was 3.5 seconds due to low light.  Got home an hour later.  Upon editing my photos I was able to see a symmetrical cigar shaped craft in the photos upon magnification.  It had what looked like three white lights on the top.  One on each end and one in the center of what I took to be the top.  On the bottom there were two red lights positioned bisecting the lights on the top of the UFO. I was using a 3.5 second shutter speed and in that time the craft must have remained stationary because that shutter speed would blur anything in motion.
