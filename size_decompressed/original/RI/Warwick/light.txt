Blue ball of light arching in the sky in Warwick, Rhode Island;2011-01-21 17:11:00;10 Seconds;Blue ball of light arching in the sky in Warwick, Rhode Island Driving home from work at 17:11 hours, going East on Rt. 37 to Post Road.  I noticed a blue ball of light that turned white at the edges in the distance beyond the Toyota dealership.  I thought it was a plane (the airport is nearby), but the ball of light fell quickly, in an arching motion, in a southerly direction and disappeared behind trees/the horizon.  It looked almost like a shooting star, but much, much closer and was surely in our immediate atmosphere.  It was still light out and the object left no exhaust trail.;41.7149042857143;-71.4116592857143

When I looked to the south, there was a very bright light that was stationary.  It was larger than a star and had an almost artificial look to it- not like a star, but much brighter. I watched it for a few minutes and then went in to get my iPad. I have a star chart program and wanted to know if it was a planet or something. When I came back out a minute later, it was just gone.;41.7149042857143;-71.4116592857143

((HOAX??  Date is flawed contact information defective.)) saw a round ball of light moving slowly then disappeared;2015-11-17 20:00:00;5 minutes;saw a round ball of light moving slowly then disappeared I looked out my window and saw a big ball of light it looked way bigger then a plane and it was unlike anything I've ever seen in my life before.  It was flying slowly in one direction just above the trees then after about 5 minutes it just disappeared.  It was about 8:00 at night when i saw it i told my brother and we both went outside to look at it.  It was so strange and right before it disappeared it looked like it was spinning and had many lights on it.  I took pictures of it and when I look at the pictures it looked like it was changing size/shape. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the report is a hoax.  Date is flawed, which we have changed, and time may be flawed, as well.  Witness indicates flawed e-address.  PD));41.7149042857143;-71.4116592857143

Last night i went out on my deck to cover my grill. I was looking up at the moon due to it was almost a full moon.  Then i saw a bright light cruising from South east- towards north West. In a way that a plane or a drone would never catch up.  I have seen many shooting stars in my day. However this was differently alot lower in the atmosphere.  It was moving in front of stars and this made no sound and nothing was blinking on it. This my first experience if it is what i saw an UFO.  Just walk out right the time i guess.  My wife thinks im lying but it was shocking to see it here in Warwick ri.  I searched everywhere the next day on the web if anyone else saw it but no luck.;41.7149042857143;-71.4116592857143
