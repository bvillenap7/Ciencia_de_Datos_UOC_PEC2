This one I watched for 4 hours with my boyfriend.  It kept moving up slowly.  It had all different shapes it shape shifted.  Glowing red, purple, blue, orange, green and red.  I watched it from my telescope but I couldn't see a clear visual.  So my boyfriend and I just watched. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the object may have been a twinkling star.

An orange glowing crescent that shrunk until it was just a dot and then vanished.  ((anonymous report));2018-01-07 23:30:00;5 seconds;An orange glowing crescent that shrunk until it was just a dot and then vanished. I saw an orange glow.  At first I thought it was the moon because it looked like a crescent, but it was turned so that it was facing up like a smile.  It gradually got smaller and smaller until it was just a dot and then it vanished.  The sky itself became dimmer.  It was orange and bright the entire time.
