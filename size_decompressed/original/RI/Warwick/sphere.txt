Warwick, Rhode Island Jan/Feb 1978 Red Orb;1978-01-05 00:00:00;5 mins;Warwick, Rhode Island Jan/Feb 1978 Red Orb It was 1978, (Jan 25th-Feb 5th 1978)two weeks before the big Blizzard.  The place was Warwick, Rhode Island, the Buttonwoods/Appanoag Section.  It was sometime late at night or early morning.  My parents were sleeping. I went to the bedroom window.  I observed round (like a ball) light, slowly decending to the ground.  The distance I'd guess was about a city block away.  Since I was a child, I said to myself, Oh a plane light fell off. I had not heard of UFO's, etc. The next day I went to my babysitter's house.  I told he about the red plane light in a nonchalantly way.  It was not a big deal to me.  The babysitter's husband, worked at TF Green airport in Warwick about a mile away.  When I recall his uniform it had decoration like an Airforce uniform.  I guess he might have been in the service somehow.  The babysitter told her Husband what I saw. The Husband came home and I overheard him telling his wife there was a lot of phone calls about the red light and that no airplanes lost lights.  He proceeded to question me about it.  I simply told him that I saw an airplane light fall. He made a phone call and then returned to work. As an adult now, I realize that an airplane light, if it fell off a plane, would not still be lighted up red.  I researched old newspapers for any mention of this incident.  For all the phone calls there supposedly were, not one mention in the local Providence Journal Bulletin.;41.7149042857143;-71.4116592857143

Bright reddish/orange self-illuminated sphere rising up from Warwick Pond in Warwick, Rhode Island.;2015-08-02 18:40:00;10 seconds;Bright reddish/orange self-illuminated sphere rising up from Warwick Pond in Warwick, Rhode Island. I was in my backyard around 8:40 PM EST, when all of a sudden, I saw a reddish/orange sphere that appeared to be rising straight up out of Warwick Pond, and approximately 600 feet due west from me.  At first I thought it was the sun but it had already set. Also, the sphere seemed to be self illuminated.  Upon assessing the estimated distance from my vantage point to the object, the sphere appeared to be approximately 9 or 10 feet in diameter and highly reflective which seemed strange, as at the same time it seemed to be self illuminated. As it appeared to be rising slowly from the pond my first hypothesis was that it was a mylar balloon, but after watching it for about 10 seconds I came to the conclusion that it was a) too large, b) too bright, and c) it seemed like hard metallic object, not mylar.  I would also like to note that it was self illuminating as bright as the setting sun would be, but as I previously stated the sun had already set. I ran as far as I could to the edge of my yard to see if I could see it rise above the trees, but was unsuccessful in following its trajectory.  My boyfriend and I quickly got in our car to drive around the neighborhood to see if we could see any signs of a disturbance or other witnesses, but were unsuccessful.;41.7149042857143;-71.4116592857143
Three orange balls of light traveled past the backyard.  ((anonymous report));2018-07-18 18:05:00;15 minutes;Three orange balls of light traveled past the backyard. I was doing the backyard thing, grilling, approximately 6 PM, evening, sunny, blue skies, 80 degrees, when, out of the corner of my eye, I notice three orange balls of light approaching over my shoulder.  These things weren’t little paper lanterns, you know, like the ones that you guys keep reporting on.  These lights weren’t that stuff drifting way up there in the sky. Nothing like that, these suckers were big, okay, easily 50 feet in diameter, and they’re making their way slowly past me.  I don’t know, maybe three or four hundred feet above me and off to my left. And I was thinking, shit, these things are for real.  No sound, perfectly quiet, and they had this majestic, almost stately, quality about them.  So I’m calling my wife, you know, because she’s gotta come out and see this, and I don’t know where the hell she is, the living room, the kitchen, whatever.  So I just did the next thing that came to my mind and stood there and took off my oven mitt and saluted these things. Seriously, does the government have any idea what’s going on in the airspace above this country?  I mean, these things looked like they were the ones in charge as they slowly made their way toward Greenwich Bay.;41.7149042857143;-71.4116592857143
