I walked out my door, looked up at the sky and saw a brilliant white, circular type object float through the sky.  As it flew down towards the earth it was just as white and big at the bottom as at the top.  (As if it was producing a flash that lit up the area it was just in too!)  The funny part was that I sensed that it really was not that far away.  Perhaps a small craft just 1 mile away.  The thing that was most remarkable about it was the tremendous rate of speed.  In just a second it appeared, flew and then disappeared.  What also was remarkable was the brilliant white, milky light surrounding it.  Almost like it has cloak itself to appear as a cloud, and then started to travel. Remarkable.  One more thing, there was light around, the sun was up.;41.7149042857143;-71.4116592857143
