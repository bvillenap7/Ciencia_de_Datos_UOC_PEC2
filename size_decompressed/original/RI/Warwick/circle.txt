The object emitted a pulsing light exactly like a star. 1 person witness.I told my sister about it she looked out the window for a second or two but it was gone by then,the object was round,it was large enough to catch your eye,(not huge,),The light was white (pulsing light) I am 16 and my sister is 18 i go to pilgrim high school,i moved from providence to warwick when i was about 6 years old.It was a very clear night out ,there were many stars out (and very few cloads. I have pictures of my house and i can add with a graphics program where the object went.;41.7149042857143;-71.4116592857143
Heard on AM 630 WPRO art bell,ufos were spotted.Went out w/ portable radio saw a big bright light an what appeared to be a comet.;1998-09-26 00:00:00;3 hrs;Heard on AM 630 WPRO art bell,ufos were spotted.Went out w/ portable radio saw a big bright light an what appeared to be a comet. I first looked out my window after hearing on art bell lights were spotted,went to the side of my house to look at it,saw a bright light that turned out to be a star. I then went to my backyard becuase there are less trees,and looked up and saw nothing.I then went back to the front of my house,(same route),and once i arrived at my driveway,near my deck,almost ready to enter my door,i saw a very bright white light. (I did not see it when i was leaving my house,becuase it was in back of me.)I then went inside to get my binoculars and zoomed in the light was steady and did not blink,the shape did not change.  I then looked above my roof to see if there were any other objects near it,and i saw what at first i thought was a comet.(Some haze)I zoomed in and i saw 5 white circles,with steady non blinking light,the objects did not move,all the circles were the same size.(The circles were much smaller and farther away than the other object to the right.) The circles were arranged one behind another equally spaced in a arrangement that looks like a hook. I was pretty convinced this was a comet,as soon as I looked at it becuase one circle in the middle had a little haze around it.But that would not explain how the much bigger circle and much closer circle did not have haze around it also.  It was very cold out and i went inside for about 15-20 min then went back out to see if the objects moved,and they did not.I then zoomed in on both objects again and there shape did not change and they did not move.I went back inside after 5 min,then i went back outside after my dog started barking (he does this alot i doubt it had anything to do with the light).But I did find it strange and i was a bit scared becuase he stayed outside for about a hour,and i thought the weather got to him,or he got to a fight with another animal. I yelled out his name a couple times 4 or 5 and he came in. I then went back outside with my binoculars for a final look and the objects did not change. I went back inside.  I assume the objects may have stayed out there all night until the early morning,but i was to cold and not very impressed by it,(i thought it was a comet),but know think otherwise.(After hearing all the reports. The report of this object sounds very similar to mine! : http://www.ufocenter.com/S3913.html   Except that it did not move fast. And i saw the object a hour after his,[makes sense if it was coming to me it would take a while]and the object he viewed was moving east(coming towards new england),maybe this is the same object.Also there seems to be a few white only objects. ALSO:This object sounds the same an occured in my state!! AMBER OVOID UFO SEEN IN PORTSMOUTH, RHODE ISLAND http://www.sightings.com/ufo/spainreleases.htm On Tuesday, September 22, 1998, at 4:18 p.m., Roscoe Sweeney (a pseudonym), a 22-year-old sailor in the U.S. Navy, was driving north on Burma Road in Portsmouth, Rhode Island (population 13,840) one mile from the Melville shipyard when he spied a UFO. It started above the tree line, about 10 degrees above the horizon, and disappeared into the clouds... Ended up slightly 30 degrees up. The departure angle was close to 45 degrees. It departed into the west and up. I'm a reliable judge of speed. This thing was smoking and accelerating! Speed 400 to 500 knots, with a behind-the-trees dash at Mach 1 (600 knots), easy. It was the brilliance that brought my eye to it. If I had done a slow blink, I would have missed it completely. This was truly an amazing sight. He described the UFO as oval, like if you put your thumb and index finger together to make the OK sign. No blinking lights. Glowed like looking at a picture of the filtered sun...amber/gold. Portsmouth is on Aquidneck Island in Rhode Island's Narragansett Bay, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) southeast of Providence, the state capital. (Email Interview) I could check my local airport -(tf green),[across the cornfield]next to my house, to see if they spotted anything on radar [;41.7149042857143;-71.4116592857143

At which we stopped the car in amazement not only of what we saw but that we were the only people stopped to watch these figures. They to me looked like two orbs of light with an even stronger light in the center of the orbs. Then once we were out of the car looking for a moment one of the orbs just took off at a slow rate of speed at first but then sped up and was out of sight while the other one remained. We watched it hoover for a couple minutes as if it was watching us watching it then it startied decending at a slow rate of speed slow enough for us to follow. So we got back in the car and followed an it stopped a quarter mile up the road at a hill which was the highest point in the area which we then stopped and began viewing again while I! took pictures on my old phone which I still have. Then it started blinking on and off slowly for about ten seconds all the while hoovering upward then quickly vanished.All the while we felt that it most deffinitly knew we were watching. I decided to write this report after seeing a similiar one reported on tv. That's my story.;41.7149042857143;-71.4116592857143

A circular fire that was bright red was in the sky to the north.  It was moving pretty quickly, staying level with the horizon.  It got smaller over the 3 minutes we saw it.  At first it was clearly a circle, but was smaller over time.  It was moving too slowly to be a meteor.  It was not an airplane.  The people who saw it were: an adult man (teacher), an adult woman (college professor), 2 college students and a 1st grader. X;41.7149042857143;-71.4116592857143

Circular Object (Fiery?) over Warwick, RI;2012-08-17 20:42:00;@30 seconds;Circular Object (Fiery?) over Warwick, RI UFO sighted at 8:42pm, today, August 17, 2012 moving Southwest to Northeast over Warwick, RI specifically over the Oakland Beach area.  Object appeared as a small orange light and seemed to be on fire as it flickered in intensity.  No other lights were seen on the object.  A Southwest Airlines 737, on the downwind leg for Runway 23 at Providence was trailing the object at less than 1 mile and at the same altitude.  I estimated the speed of the object to be around 160-190 knots.  I was able to judge the speed because the Southwest jet was keeping pace with it and then start to overtake it. The object was observed for about 30 seconds before suddenly disappearing.  It'd be interesting to discover if the Southwest crew reported anything. Weather conditions were:  Temp: 75 degrees F. Dewpoint: 67 degrees F. Visibility: 10 miles Heat Index: 79 degrees F. Wind: 260 degrees 5 knots Altimeter: 29.82 Clouds:  Few 050, Sct 140, Sct 250   I am a former military air traffic controller.  This was no aircraft.  No photo was taken as I did not want to lose sight of it. The object was also witnessed by my son.;41.7149042857143;-71.4116592857143

There was an unusual red light SSE of my location that at first appeared to be an unfamiliar mounted light.  Upon inspection with binoculars it was unattached to anything and had a smaller green light that moved from right to left.  By naked eye, it was about 1/8 around.  It stayed in the sky for at least five minutes, then appeared to descend, not quickly or slowly, over a few minutes until it disappeared.  There was no reduction in size as it descended.  There was no sound.;41.7149042857143;-71.4116592857143
