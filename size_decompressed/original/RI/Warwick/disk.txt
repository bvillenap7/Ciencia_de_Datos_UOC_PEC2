Silent enormous disc shaped craft.;1975-10-13 16:30:00;20 minutes;Silent enormous disc shaped craft As my friend was driving and I was a passenger, I saw what I thought was a shooting star as we were were headed to her home.   As we got out of the car, there was a silent, enormous, disc shaped craft stalled over her house.  It was approximately 1000 ft off the ground, and larger than her 5 bedroom, 2 story home.  It was circular and a dull metal color, like pewter, with a compartment beneath lit up by lights.   After about 5 minutes, it started moving slowly, and it was scanning a creek behind her home with a red, transparent light disc which was directly in the water and moved in sync with the craft.  I still wonder what they were looking for.   After about ten minutes, it slowly moved away from her house, and we got in the car and proceeded to follow it.  It stopped over a local farm where we could not gain access.  It then emitted a noise sounding like three jet airplanes preparing to take off, then darted up diagonally, and in five seconds, was no longer visible.   That was it, I never saw it again, and I will never forget it as long as I live. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although source of report does not indicate that fact.

Two orange/gold saucer shaped craft;1982-06-06 01:00:00;2 minutes;Two orange/gold saucer shaped craft The event in question literally changed my life as I saw this as a small boy and I continue on in life as an adult to look toward the skies and ponder this incredible moment daily. Two saucer shaped craft were trailing each other in a very measured and steady pace at what I approximated to be an east to southwest direction.  The craft were saucer shaped, glowed orange/gold, and had what seemed at the time to have revolving/pulsating globes around the crafts center.  It's impossible to measure size or distance but they were either huge or incredibly close to the treetop level.   They passed over the outer edge of T.F. Green Airport but I did not see any airplanes or recognition of the craft from the skies.  I lost site of the craft as they dissapeared out of my point of view and this lasted about 2 minutes.  (This was viewed from a bedroom window) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));41.7149042857143;-71.4116592857143

We proceeded to watch it slowly move in a north direction,and as it was almost directly over house, it just disappeared!  While looking up we noticed an object flying  Erratically way up in the sky moving in directions like nothing we had then,or know...from that point i was hooked. Hoping someone else that pulled over will see this and remember also.;41.7149042857143;-71.4116592857143
bright light hovering over the warwick mall;2010-04-10 00:00:00;10 minutes;bright light hovering over the warwick mall It was around midnight and me and my friend were driving on the highway toward the town of Johnston from Warwick. We passed a mall in our state called “The Warwick Mall” and we a giant flashing light in the sky. I slowed down so we could keep looking because I knew it didn’t look like a plane. It got closer to us, enough to see the shape was like a tall saucer, and there were two lights in the front like headlights. Then I saw smaller lights around the rim. My friend I were starring at it in disbelief for about 10 minutes. Ironically the Warwick Mall was just flooded by a bunch of rainy weather that just happened in RI so the whole thing is damaged and closed down. I feel like “they” or “it” was looking down at that. They were hovering right over it and then passed over me on the highway and we lost sight. I almost didn’t believe it at first, but I’m sure of it.;41.7149042857143;-71.4116592857143

I asked my wife do you see that she looks at it and then she looks back at me in confusion. and as we keep driving towards the intersection the trees block out our view of it. On that same trip about 5 minutes later we see it again over some other trees, and the same thing happens where the trees block out the view as we drive.  The first time was in Warwick and a few minutes later it was in Providence while driving on Huntington Ave towards Carter St. like it was just waiting for us there just hovering.  and both times we didn't get to look at it for more than 5 to 10 seconds.;41.7149042857143;-71.4116592857143
