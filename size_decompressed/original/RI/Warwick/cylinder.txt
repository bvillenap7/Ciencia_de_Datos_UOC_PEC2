Over the airport, I saw something that looked like the moon eclipse, then seemed like clouds over the moon.  The moon was in a different area clear as day. as all the stars around the area.  This is a route I go everyday for years.  Never saw anything like this. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be both sincere, and sober-minded.
