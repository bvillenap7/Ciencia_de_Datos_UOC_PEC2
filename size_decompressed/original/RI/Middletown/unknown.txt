Satellite Imagery of the course of 44 years.;2015-04-23 00:00:00;44 years known;Satellite Imagery of the course of 44 years. E-Mail with sample pictures have been sent to Director for study.  Satellite Images using multiple sources have been studied and examined over the course of three months.  Similar areas and lakes have been studied to attempt to find a flaw in the satellites images, but none have been found.  All USO's (?), are localized in Lake Titicaca in Peru and no where else on the Planet. Studying all images by year has shown a significant change in the behavior of these USO's.  These objects are much more abundant near the shores, near the northern and  southern areas of the lake and have been pictured over land as well.  2003 shows a drastic decline of these objects in the above areas with 2013 showing even more decline.  I believe this is due to the rise in urban areas and the population in general, as well as advancements in satellite imaging technology. Among these objects photographed I have photos from the NASA Earth at Night satellite imagery that shows lights inside Lake Titicaca where there should be no presence of light of the magnitude it is shown. ((NUFORC Note:  We have looked at several photos, provided by the witness, and all we see is very faint green lights.  We do not know what they are, but we have no reason to suspect that they are UFO-related.  We will continue to correspond with the source of the information.
