They all seemed very low and there was cloud cover with light rain so they had to be under the cloud ceiling.  There were no strobe or flashing lights just a very odd orange hue that resembled a flame.  The third object rapidly increased speed and caught up to the second object.  Upon flying with it for a couple seconds it then shot off in an easterly direction while the other two completely vanished. Never seen anything like it before in my life and I've sailed offshore over 15,000 miles with plenty of satellites, aircraft and shooting star experiences.;41.5194;-71.277
