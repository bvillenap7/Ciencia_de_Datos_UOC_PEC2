It looked like a low-flying plane was completely engulfed in orange flame, there was no trail, the orange extended upward a bit. It was going at the pace and speed of a plane, in a straight line for about 2 min, then it seemed to turn about 30 degrees and slow a bit, and maybe drop altitude a bit, but ultimately continued on, getting smaller and farther away.  When it was very small it seemed to dim and brighten in a pulsating fashion.   I called my 7 year-old son in and he saw it too and we watched it until it was gone.  Nothing fell from it, no debris, no tail.   I am a registered nurse.;41.5194;-71.277
