Possible correlation to South Kingston sighting of 28 Feb;2006-02-28 19:45:00;10 sec;Possible correlation to South Kingston sighting of 28 Feb This report is in relation to the report of a chevron over South Kingston, RI on 28 Feb 06.  While returning home from my daughters horse lessons, I noted two lights to the west that seemed to be standing still.  From my vantage point on Browns Lane, I have an unrestricted view of Narragansett bay, Portsmith Island, and South Kingstown.  I often see lights from aircraft in this area that are heading into T.F. Green or Quonsett airport.  What made these lights stand out was the fact that they didnt appear to move and they appeared to be at the same altitude.  The distance between the two lights appeared to be maybe a hundred yards, and did not have the staggard appearance of distance that aircraft in a landing pattern do.  Having read the report of 28 Feb, I can also add that these lights would have been in the direction of the area that the report came from at a distance of abot 10 miles.  Sighing lasted about 10 to 13 seconds before a curve in the road obscured my view.;41.5194;-71.277
Two yellowish-orange lights flying in the sky and then vanished.;2014-07-26 21:10:00;5 minutes;Two yellowish-orange lights flying in the sky and then vanished. My girlfriend and I were driving down Maple Ave. Middletown, RI, towards West Main Road, when I pointed out two yellowish-orange lights in the sky.  As we continued to drive, we were able to keep up with the objects.   We observed the two lights zigzag, and eventually crossed one another.   As we continued to drive now on East Main Road, the two objects flew parallel, one trailing slightly behind.   Then, we got stuck at a red light at the corner of Shell gas station, the objects flew farther away and out of nowhere disappeared.   We continued driving on East Main Rd. to see any signs of them, but saw nothing but sky.;41.5194;-71.277
