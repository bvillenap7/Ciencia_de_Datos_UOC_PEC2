Foster/Scituate UFO/UAP;2019-07-28 01:15:00;2 minutes;Foster/Scituate UFO/UAP Visiting with my parents we were by the pool when my dad said “hey what is that?”  I looked up and we both saw a shiny sphere I would estimate to be at around 10,000 feet. Not a plane or drone by the high reflectiveness, speed and way it moved.  Size of a car.   Moved in a straight line with no trail.  Went to grab my phone for a pic and it was gone. Weather balloon maybe...;41.7802;-71.7276
