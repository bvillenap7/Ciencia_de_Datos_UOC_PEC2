Object moving SE with 2 flaming engines before disappearing.;2018-09-20 18:30:00;5-8 seconds;Object moving SE with 2 flaming engines before disappearing. Driving East on RT 101I spotted what I could only discribe as 2 flaming engines.  Craft moved in a SE direction before seeing to move into clouds but after not noticing any light it seemed to have just vanished.  I could only see a vuage outline of the craft in a shape similar to a plane but the 2 engines seemed to flank the craft.  Again both emitting a short trail of fire. I believe me and a friend have seen a similar object years ago on the eastern side of RI.  Flying low overhead with a similar glow and seemed to decent near the border of MA.;41.7802;-71.7276
