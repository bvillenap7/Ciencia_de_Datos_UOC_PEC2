It seemed to hover over us initially but it just kept going.  It was travelling from a south west to northeast direction and eventually vanished.  For a little while it seemed as though it had a pear of even a cone shape.  Did anyone else see this?;41.8786601941747;-71.3693708737863

Extremely small light moving at a constant speed like an airplane, but extremely far in the skies.;2015-05-01 20:37:00;30 seconds;Extremely small light moving at a constant speed like an airplane, but extremely far in the skies. The light had a constant speed same as an airplane, but as far away as I had usually seen. It was  like a meteorite, although it took long to desappear.  From where I stood I could see the moon, it was 2 second after when I saw the small dot of light  away from south to north when I saw it moving at a constant speed similar to an air plane, but stremely far away.  You would have to focus very well to even notice there is something moving. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Possible UFO or military aircraft above McCoy Stadium after the Pawtucket Red Sox - Scranton Willkes-Barre Rail Riders baseball game.;2015-07-03 21:30:00;~30 minutes;Possible UFO or military aircraft above McCoy Stadium after the Pawtucket Red Sox - Scranton Willkes-Barre Rail Riders baseball game. I was in attendance at the Pawtucket Red Sox baseball game on July 3, 2015, and the fireworks display afterwards.  During the fireworks display, there was in the sky what appeared to be an aircraft with a steady red light and flashing green light hovering above and the west of the fireworks.  My sister and brother in-law both witnessed the phenomenon as well.   On no less than three occasions the aircraft began to accelerate at a high rate of speed and then suddenly stop after a short distance.  The moment the fireworks stopped after the grand finale, the aircraft did what appeared to be a U-turn in the sky, zig-zagged a bit as though it were drunk, and then shot off at a high rate of speed.   I have seen military aircraft perform similar aerial maneuvers, such as the F-22 Raptor.  Therefore, I did not immediately assume that it was a UFO.  Nevertheless, it certainly was not any kind of commercial or private aircraft.;41.8786601941747;-71.3693708737863
Staring at this bright flickering star in the sky behind the star appeared a slightly smaller brightly lit orb.  ((anonymous report));2017-08-25 09:38:00;10 seconds;I was staring at this bright flickering star in the sky, when from behind the star appeared a slightly smaller brightly lit orb, which floated slightly above the star and then stood still for at least 3 seconds.  Then shot east from the star, going from visibly traveling east to vanishing through thin air. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
