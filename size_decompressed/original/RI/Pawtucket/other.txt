White ball of light/orb flying silently.;2020-08-25 19:35:00;2 mins 45 secs;White ball of light/orb flying silently. Was taking pictures of storm clouds in the area when I noticed this white orb flying and knew it wasn't a plane or drone.  Was flying slowly.  Didn't look like anything I could recognize and took a picture and a short video of the object.  Had to zoom in with the camera to see something because when the camera zoomed out couldn't pick up the light.  But could see it with my eyes. Just looked weird to be a normal craft.  Figured to share it.;41.8786601941747;-71.3693708737863
