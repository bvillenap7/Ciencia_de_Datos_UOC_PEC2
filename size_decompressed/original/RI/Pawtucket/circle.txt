Round hovering objent with bright colored lights;2013-07-27 21:00:00;minutes;Round hovering objent with bright colored lights On July 27, 2013, at approximately 9:10 pm I was taking my dog for a walk with my daughter and was just a couple of blocks from my house.   We  were on Power Road, just a couple of blocks from Mineral Spring Avenue walking towards Smithfield Avenue in Pawtucket, RI.    My daughter stopped in her tracks and pointed up to the sky and yelled...”hey, whats that”?  I looked up and saw a round circular object with different bright colored lights that appeared to be moving in a circular motion on the circumference of the craft.  They could have been red/and or orange, etc. but I was nervous thinking I was looking at a UFO.  I ran halfway down the street with my daughter, two dogs.  I turned around to go back home to get a phone, a camera, my car with On Star and my sister, but when I returned it  had disappeared within 5 minutes.   When I returned to the same area I thought I saw something in the sky that had passed over Power Rd going towards Charles Street in North Providence, we followed it and lost site.   I have never seen anything like this is the sky and this is the first sighting that I personally have ever had in my entire life. My background is:  I am a homeowner in Pawtucket, RI, and have lived in the same house since 1982.  I worked for 2 different mortgage companies in management before taking an early retirement.  I am also a registered patent owner.;41.8786601941747;-71.3693708737863
