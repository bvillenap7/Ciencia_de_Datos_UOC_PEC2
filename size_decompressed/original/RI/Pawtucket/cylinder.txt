Hovered over Pawtucket, RI and had red flashing lights at the bottom;2009-10-01 08:00:00;10 minutes;Hovered over Pawtucket, RI and had red flashing lights at the bottom I was on the highway and saw a cylinder shaped object that was very large moving extremely slow, so I got off the highway and followed it as it slowly hovered over everything. Then it hovered over one area for about 5 minutes then slowly moved east. It had two blinking red lights at the bottom of it and didn't make a sound as it hovered. It also had white lights that didn't blink at all. It also appeared to have some sort of windows, but it was getting too dark to see. I'm positive it wasn't a plane or anything like that.;41.8786601941747;-71.3693708737863
