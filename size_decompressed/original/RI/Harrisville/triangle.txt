I noticed three bright lights in a row, higher up than stadium lights (my first suspicion).   I was driving and pulled off onto a side street heading towards the object.  I noticed other drivers doing the same.   The lights did not move but I could now see another light further back which indicated the triangle shape.   The object began to move slowly and then took off and I lost sight of it over the trees.   I began to drive home again and noticed some fast, low flying planes heading in the same direction of the object.;41.9764;-71.6534
