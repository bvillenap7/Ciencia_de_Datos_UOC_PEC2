It went from me staring at it to my left right across the sky and the shot off to disappear.  There were planes around the sky and looking up at the small lights of the planes they were moving at the speed of about 1 inch a second, this light moved about 3 feet a second.  The light looked like a big star, but took off.  Let me know if anyone else saw something.;41.9764;-71.6534
