unusual light in sky;2004-12-13 20:35:00;less than a second;unusual light in sky I was driving north on Rte. 2, right near the Exeter/North Kingstown town line.  I went around a curve near Exeter Road and the RI veterans cemetery, when all of a sudden something in the sky caught my eye.  It kind of looked like a star, but the partly cloudy skies made seeing stars very difficult.  bright white or blue light.  it moved west, curving a little bit before disappearing behind a cloud.  the way it moved reminded me of a kid playing with a laser pointer on a wall...kind of an S-shaped curve.  it was fast...but I've seen meteor showers before and it definitely wasn't as fast as a meteor.  It definitely wasn't an airplane...it was moving too fast and its turns were much too quick.;41.574;-71.6076
