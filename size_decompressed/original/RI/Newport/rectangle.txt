Craft hovering about a half-mile over my head;1970-08-15 12:00:00;several minutes;Craft hovering about a half-mile over my head My first sighting was in 1970 near Newport, Rhode Island.  I was seven years old, playing outside.  It was summer, a bright sunny day.   I looked up and saw an object floating above me.  It looked similar to a lunar module.  Very 'boxy' with lots of projections extending from it.  It made no sound and lifted straight up into the sky until it was gone.   I have experienced three sightings of UFOs in my lifetime.
