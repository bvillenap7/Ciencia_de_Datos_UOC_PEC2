2 fireball objects changing to triangle objects pulsing orange light flying overhead at purgatory chasm in Newport.;2012-07-07 22:09:00;2 minutes;2 fireball objects changing to triangle objects pulsing orange light flying overhead at purgatory chasm in Newport. Me, and my cousin were at Purgatory Chasm near second beach. I Noticed what looked like 2 embers of a fire coming up over the trees. They looked to be moving straight up, and as they got higher they started to take a triangle shape. It was a subtle change not really noticeable. They were glowing orange, but in the center of the object there was a pulsing light. It was pulsing like a slow heartbeat. the speed stayed steady, and there was no sound being emitted. My cousin literally thought it was debris from fireworks until they went straight up, then flew overhead. both objects just faded into the sky, and dissipated. I Thought the first one went into the clouds, but when the second one followed it faded before it reached the clouds.
