Light flying across sky.;2014-07-05 21:00:00;hour;light flying across sky The four of us were outside on the deck watching the fireworks and chatting. I was leaning back in my chair looking up at the stars when I noticed one of the stars moving across the sky.   So I said to my friend I think I just saw a UFO or is that a plane.  He looked at me and said thats no plane.  So whithin an hour we saw this light pass by over our heads about 800 feet up pass by four times.  Each time it passes it would disappear and whithin 15 or 20 minutes reappaear going in different direction. It was not going in a straight line. It would glide across. the sky and then bounce up and down and zig zag then go straight ahead.  We did see a few planes pass by as wll since the airport is some what near us over the water.  But it was no plane.;41.6842;-71.2649
