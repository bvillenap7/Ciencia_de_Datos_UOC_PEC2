Three purple/red objects with strobe traveling SE to ENE.;2015-07-29 21:00:00;30 seconds;Three purple/red objects with strobe traveling SE to ENE. Three purple/red objects traveling southeast to east-northeast.  The objects were  spaced about 30 degrees apart and traveling slower than most small aircraft.   Because  of trees each was visible for only 6 seconds.  I managed to get my binoculars in time  to see the second and third objects.   The outline of the spheres was diffuse and not clearcut.  Each object had a slow flashing white strobe light.  The objects were quite striking color wise and appeared about 1/4 the diameter of the moon which was very  bright that night.;41.6842;-71.2649
