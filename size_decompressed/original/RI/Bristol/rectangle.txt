Bright reflective yellowish rectangular object larger than a plane.;2016-07-23 17:54:00;3 minutes;Bright reflective yellowish rectangular object larger than a plane. My father and I witnessed a very bright object in the southwestern sky over Bristol, RI.  We presumed the sun was reflecting off a plane or maybe even the international space station.  It was light enough outside to see a relatively large rectangular object, moving about as fast as the ISS from SW to SE at about 40-45 degrees.  The color appeared to be a sparkling yellow. I could not make out any wings.  The object was larger than a plane, that would have been visible in the sky, at the same altitude.  I checked the NASA website to see if it could have been the ISS and we were much too early for a sighting.  The speed of the craft was steady and moved across the sky until it was out of our sight.  No distinguishing markings could be seen because of the reflected light.  It was just so much larger than anything I have ever seen in the sky.   I heard about the solar plane and suspected it could have been that but its flight plan had it leaving Egypt for its last leg of its flight to Abu Dhabi. The observers were 64 and 93 years old.;41.6842;-71.2649
