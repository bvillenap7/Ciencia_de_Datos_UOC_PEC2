Dark shape with burnt orange glow near Bristol RI;2001-08-15 02:30:00;1 min;Dark shape with burnt orange glow near Bristol RI After reading a report dated 17 Feb,2003 from Roslindale MA, I decided to submit a similar sighting I experianced. During the early morning hours on the above date I saw something very dark against the sky moving from the direction of Fallriver MA in the direction of Bristol RI (East to West)at a high rate of speed. From my vantage point it appeared to be at around 500-1000 feet in altitude. There were no navigational lights and I could not decern a shape but there appeared to be burnt orange light swirling around it. at first i thought it was a reflection from the sodium lights on a nearby building on the window of the car.  I exited the vehicle and still saw it. I could hear no sound (jet or propeller). I then removed my glasses, thinking it may be a reflection on them but could still see it. I watched it until it was out of sight. the sky that night was clear and there was very little humidity. (unusual for our area that time of year) and there was no Moon. I belive that the orange glow I saw may have been St. Elmo's fire on the outside of the object. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));41.6842;-71.2649
