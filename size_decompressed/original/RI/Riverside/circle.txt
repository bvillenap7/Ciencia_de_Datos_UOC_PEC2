This moved like a craft, not a drifting cloud and was definately round and white or glowing white. I viewed this w/ a sunny blue sky background as it moved until it disappeared into clouds, maybe 3 minutes total.

While going outside to the backyard at 10pm., to close the pool gate, I looked up as usual to see stars on a clear night's sky.  Directly above, was one round red glowing ball, just below the cloud range, easily seen. It moved closer, and I went back in a few steps to get my Nikon camera by the door.  I then went outside again quickly, and was able to get 3 photos of it still there.  The 1st 2 photos were about the same but the third photo taken as it QUICKLY went deeper into the night sky.  Only in the third photo, did I see any change in shape, from a circle.  Third photo, it was a small triangle with an arm light streak.  There were no other air crafts in the sky.  There was no sound to the object, and it is very quiet in this area.;41.7756;-71.3568
