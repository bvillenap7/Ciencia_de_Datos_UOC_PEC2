4 witness daytime sighting of metallic rotating ball at Winnipeg international air show.;1998-08-25 14:00:00;30 min;4 witness daytime sighting of metallic rotating ball at Winnipeg international air show. Metallic Ball at WPG air show  The date given is my best guess the year could have been +or- 1.  II could obtain the exact year from old friend who lived at address, but if anyone wants to check into it further it was on the first or second Day of the Winnipeg international air show.  My Brother, a friend and myself were watching the air show from another friend’s balcony. It was the top floor (14th?) facing east. I was on the balcony having a smoke and watching the Snow birds do there routine. They broke formation and one flew past the apartment (approx height and distance to follow).  As it did I caught sight of what looked like a metal flake that came off the plane. (This was not in the area prior to the plane passing by)   After watching it for about 4 seconds it became very apparent to me that this was not a piece of the plane. It was round like a beach ball (refer to following beach ball description) 6 feet in diameter and very shiny.  There was no light except for its metallic reflection. Picture one of those beach balls that is divided into 8 different colored sections, now remove 3 of them. The larger side (5 slices) was bright polished metallic in color. The 3 missing sections were just that, missing and you could see the inside of the shiny side, which appeared dimmer. I yelled for everyone to get out here and see this thing before its gone they came out expecting to see some part of the air show, but all had the same what the H@#l is that reaction I did. It was aprox 500' or more off the ground (snow birds might be able to provide better distances) and about 1000-1500' (3 or 4 residential blocks) away. It was very clear what we were seeing, the sky was blue, only a few nimbus clouds and a moderate wind (20 kmh? could check airport weather for exact info)  It rotated consistently about 1 per second giving it a pulsating look. It remand fixed at that point in the sky for about 2 minutes, then began to move straight up over the course of 20 to 30 min (still rotating) completely unaffected by the air currents that day. We watched it until it was no longer visible.  I would like to include here that myself and one of my friends both saw what looked like 2 specs (very high altitude approximately 5 min prior to losing sight) These specs moved very fast side by side formation from the SE to NW as they passed the ball they made some sporadic movements then continued NW and out of sight over the apartment we were in. (It is very possible that the specs were a trick of the eye from looking up at the blue for so long however we both saw them around the same time do similar motions) I am sure that more must have seen this as thousands were watching the air show that day and the plane I was watching would have led others to look in that direction not to mention the pilot himself might have seen it.  I will include here the areas of the city I am referring to but If necessary can be removed. We were located in the ((apartment name deleted)) east phase ((floor deleted)) floor. The object would have been over Thompson Dr between Portage and Ness ave. (1 or 2 block radius but possible further out)  The plane was moving in a NW to SE direction.  I feel this sighting must be looked at closer (daytime sighting, with the possibility of multiple witnesses, in multiple locations.)  I have included legitimate contact information. Please get in touch.  Drawings and maps can be provided if requested. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD));49.8825541843973;-97.1534052482271

Two red/orange lights, one went out and went it passed over head I could see one red light and a much bigger grey cirular object.;2013-06-29 23:00:00;5 minutes;Two red/orange lights , one went out and went it passed over head I could see one red light and a much bigger grey cirular object. Two red/orange solid lights on the horizon looked to stay motionless for a couple minutes. They where the brightest things in the sky and looked to be bigger than the couple stars I could see.   One light flickered out and a minute later I could tell it was moving toward me.  It came from the north west and going south east.  It went over head and I could see it go behind a cloud for a second so I know it must of been quite high.  Trailing behind it and to the side I could make out a grey circular object that was not lite up but at least 10x bigger than the red light.  It could of been the first object that disappeared and was now just following the first. It appeared to be high as well like a plane with no lights, I couldn’t really make any details out other than it looked grey or white and a lot bigger than the small red ball.;49.8825541843973;-97.1534052482271

Red, blue  silver rotating sphere in clear blue sky in the early afternoon;2015-10-17 14:40:00;10 minutes;red,blue silver rotating sphere in clear blue sky in the early afternoon It is october 17/2015 it is a cool but clear day here.  Working in the back yard,cleaning up the garden,raking leaves. I am moving the compost bin when I look in the nnw sky and notice a shimmering object which I thought was a mylar balloon that was caught up in the wind, which was light from the south. I was looking at this object for at least 10 mins. It seemed to rotate,into red,silver and blue it was very shiny, because it was a clear blue sky day. It is hard to judge distance, could be at least 1000 feet away when I first noticed it,and it may have been there longer. As I watched this object shine, it was stationary at the time that I first observed it, as time passed it seemed to move away from me, still could see it rotate in the blue sky until I could barely make it out, when I lost site of it.  It was just gone.;49.8825541843973;-97.1534052482271
Three lights, stayed in one spot for half an hour, flashed. And disappeared.;2020-09-12 22:00:00;50 minutes;Three lights, stayed in one spot for half an hour, flashed. And disappeared. Three lights big in the middle and two slightly smaller ones to the sides.  Equal distance from each other and the smaller lights on the side were slightly lower. stayed in one spot for at least 30 minutes. after 30 minutes flashed a few times (4-5) with a duration of aprox 30 second between flash.  After the final flash it was gone.  We have checked flight radar the app to see planes in the airspace and close range.  Only one was currently in the air (that we would have been able to see at that scale. And it was AIR1 which is the police helicopter.;49.8825541843973;-97.1534052482271
Pulsating sphere interaction with a moving object;2021-04-03 05:30:00;1 minute;Pulsating sphere interaction with a moving object 5:00 AM - woke up, when to bathroom.  Looked out window - saw a 'star'.  Normally I don't see stars in the city, too much city lights. 5:00 - 5:30 - back in bed, but can't sleep.  I have a head congestion - sinuses are all stuffy. 5:30 went to bathroom to blow nose, looked out window.  The 'star' is still in the same location about looking about South or SSE.  I can barley see the 'star' but it is there, in view, out of view, in view, out of view...  not moving.  Same size, not changing other than I can see it, then not see it...  I think it is a shimmering star, but at 5:30 AM I should not be able to see a star in the city . About, say, 5:31, this star started pulsating - yellow, and orange - over and over and becoming fully in focus - like it was rotating.  Size never changed.  I thought can this be a weird angle on a plane, it kinda looked like that, but it was in the same position as a half a half hour ago.  It was rotating/shimmering, but never moved in location. Then - a tiny second light appears - it was very small, just a bright yellow dot, ... like a meteorite, this little light shot right into or close by the big light.  This was an interaction.  The little light moved like 1-2 inches in my perception direct at the big pulsating light, it went right by it then disappeared. Then immediately, the big pulsating light moved west - a few feet from my perspective,  - my view was then blocked my a neighbors roof. Size - the pulsating light stayed the same in size, circular, rotating/pulsating.  When it moved, it moved like, the velocity of a plane, not crazy fast.;49.8825541843973;-97.1534052482271
