Orange UFO flying low through south Winnipeg;2012-07-13 22:54:00;# 1/2-4 minutes;Orange UFO flying low through south Winnipeg I  witnessed something really weird in the  St.Norbert area of Winnipeg last night.   I was driving home ( no alcohol) and saw a bright orange oval shaped light travelling very low, approx. 500-600 feet  and only going about  25 mph or so . First thing I thought was this is a plane , it`s got to be a plane , but after I approached  a stop sign , I got out of my vehicle and got a good look at it &  it was  oval shaped and with a bright orange glow  lit from within . It was also WAY too low and going really slow about 25 mph. Now , i`m not delusional by any means , I know what I saw, as a matter 0of fact I ended up following it THROUGH st.norbert until it slowed right down and STOPPED . I got out of my vehicle and shut the engine off,  & this thing was absolutely silent !  I watched it for about 15 seconds and it started flying away at a faster pace. I followed it up to near pembina hwy & the intersection of hwy # 75 and lost it from sight .  I have to tell you , i`m an amatuer  astronomer , and an aviation buff and  i`ve never seen anything like this at all. I noted the time when this happened, it was 10:54pm on the clock in my vehicle. The whole event lasted approx.  3 1/2 -4 minutes total from the time I acquired it  till it flew out of sight . The hair on the back of my neck was/ is  standing on end , this just wasn`t right.  The way it was moving  around  sort of skipping really got to me. It wasn`t flying in a straight path  ( almost like it was wandering around, quite bizzare)  This was not an R/C  aircraft  or anything else I can think of . ( no noise at all & too big)  I just had to tell someone , it was a really nice night out, so someone else had to see it , it`s just  not the kind of thing you miss. I know it was friday the 13th and everything , but this is not a joke in any way, shape or form . I wish I had a camera with me , I can tell you that I will be keeping one in my vehicle for good after what happened tonight. It`s important that someone else know what  happened out here. I`m not sure if the Airport in WPG  would have picked anything up on radar or not  , as it was flying really low , again  estimate about 5-600 feet. This   was just stunning , I could barely keep my vehicle on the road as I drove following it  through the area . I don`t think i`ll ever witness something like that again ...;49.8825541843973;-97.1534052482271
