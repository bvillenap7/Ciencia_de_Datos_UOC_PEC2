multiple flashing lights over other side of lake;2009-08-18 00:00:00;2:00;multiple flashing lights over other side of lake hey there, about two weeks ago i was at my cottage with my family. we had arrived late and had spent the day doing normal cottage stuff. later that night around 12 i decided to check out the stars because it was a very clear night, and you can see 360 degrees of stars. thats when i saw a light go over the lake. I had gotten my dad earlier because i thought i saw something moving, but this time i got his camera from him to see if anything showed up. thats when i got a big suprise ! there was something in the sky. in fact right over the other side of the lake ! there was 2 to the left one in the middle, and 4 to the right all hovering way above the other side of the lake, and they were different shapes, one was cigar shaped, one was a triangle, one was just a ball, and the other was a sphere. I started to film then moving about the sky, and a bit later every one from my family came to see, my brother, dad, and mom. i continuted filming and got a couple good pictures, plus 20 + of film, by then it was just me and my mom, and thats when we heard a loud sound, it sounded like air being moved or a loud jet, and we looked up, there was a triangler shaped ufo with 3 lights going right over are cottage about 50 feet up, it was pretty crazy ! after that i got my d40 out, and got 2 really good pictures one were you can see 2 weird lights, and one were you can see 3 lights and make out the shape. that was all for that night. 2 days later though i was by myself and i heard the same loud jet sound and a red flashing light came down to tree level and started skimming the edge of the lake as if it was looking for something, this time i was freaked out and booked it back inside the cottage.

Big long vertical  luminous beam of white light;2020-10-10 08:55:00;10;Big long vertical  luminous beam of white light We were driving on Ward avenue in the morning around 8:55 am when we saw a big vertical beam of light in the blue sky. It was a white light. Very luminous. Not moving.  It was south/east of Sage Creek.  We tried to get closer by driving in the south east direction.  We stopped on the way to keep observing it.  We got to the end of the neighbourhood. We parked to look at it and it just disappeared.  Iâ€™ve never seen something like that.;49.8825541843973;-97.1534052482271
