1st - Brassy Metalic Hockey Puck Disc with black port holes and honey comb underneath.;1985-06-01 09:45:00;5 min;1st - Brassy Metalic Hockey Puck Disc with black port holes and honey comb underneath. My cousin and myself were on the way to another friends house get some smokes. We saw this staationary light in the sky that we thought was a helocopter. We picked up some smokes and headed back to my aunts who lived in the core area. When we looked into the air the light was still there. It appeared to come closer and more clear. We coould see a honeycomb under the disc, and it hummed and hissed as it floated in the air. It floated there for a few minutes and gradually all the neighbors were out on the streets looking up at it. Oooo. Ahhh. What is that? A UFO, it's a UFO. Anyway it hovered for a few minutes and suddenly it flashed a very bright pinkish light from there honeycombs underneath., It shot rings of light from unterneath, one after another, you know like the way the transporter looks in Star Gate. Very quickly and in the blink of an eye it flashed and zoomed up into the evening sky. I always wondered what the heck could build such a craft and I would imagine how it would be to fly one. A memory I will never ever forget, thats for sure... I never had the opportunity to share this with anyone on such a large scale as the net, but that was not the first time I saw one. There was a time even earlier when I was a young lad back at home in a village in central manitoba. A brisk winter night. My brother, his girl friend and myself looking up at the sky saw an amazing light show. This experience too, is etched into my mind. About seven lights flew in formation across the sky from the north east. Suddenly they all shot off in different directions. I believe that it was in  seven different directions and then they all came back together at amazing speed and bounced off each other, as it appeared, and went in all directions again. They did this about four times before flying off for good. Well anyway, thats what I saw and I know that I am not crazy.. If I had a paper I could even draw it for you, I believe!!! There have been numkerous sightings in our region throughout the years and some of these UFOs even come only meters above the houses. I wonder what they want? What ever they are they must be man or flown, or what ever by super intellegent beings from another place or time.. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The lights would flash once on the outer lights, then once on the lights in from those, then once in the center and repeat. My friend and myself watched this for about 10 minutes flying left away from the airport not gaining any altitude and not making a sound. Once the object went over a major road it disappeared from sight ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));49.8825541843973;-97.1534052482271
Huge object with no sound above trees;2004-06-15 23:00:00;late 90s;Huge object with no sound above trees huge object black/gray matalic like, at night that made no sound as was right above us,moving slowly, very slowly, 4 emral green lights, location Arness Manitoba, Canada, was around 11:00 PM in June,2004. Was not able to get pictures of that, but did get pictures as it happened again 2 weeks later, but the second time it was a big bight light and I had my camra with me, 4 out of the 5 pictures turned out, as the shape stayed the same in every shot, made sure that I lined it up with trees so you could see it for what it is. This was very strange, I did call 911 and asked if they where flying anything, Multiple sightings with other people, in day time as well, you have a feeling like something is watching and you look up to see it in the sky, this happened afew times like that, I would say the best time you will see them is from April to June and you will see them at odd times, but you will see them, Pictures are only shown to people in the family, don't know what to do about them? And yes I know the difference between what all types of air craft look like, I hope it's your's, one did come from the lake one time to with no lights or makings(skipped across the water and stoppped then went up) Lake Winnipeg) You will see them this year they do come a few times a year.

The daughter happened to be looking up at the sky when we stopped for a brief rest in a parking lot at Henderson Highway and Hespeler.  At first we thought it was a bird riding the air currents up high, but then we noticed it was blinking. Then it moved in a sraight line in a north easterly direction and stopped just beneath the clouds and sat there blinking.  Then another one popped out of the clouds and moved to the right briefly and then changed direction and caught up to the one that was sitting under the clouds. Then they both popped into the clouds.As we turned to leave one shot down to earth at a phenomenal rate of speed.  It was a black blur that i just happened to notice out of the corner of my eye.;49.8825541843973;-97.1534052482271
UFO sighting on Bishop Grandin Boulevard;2006-01-16 03:25:00;3 min;UFO sighting on Bishop Grandin Boulevard A disk or saucer-shaped object observed over Bishop Grandin Boulevard.  On January 16th,I left my Royal Wood home to make my way to school (yes, I know it seems awfully early to leave, but I have a job to go to before I go to school). It was very cold, and usually I walk to my job listening to my Ipod blasting, so I cant hear anything. Bishop Grandin was deserted, it looked as if I was the only person in the Boulevard. As I approached the intersection at Lakewood and Bishop Grandin, I could see an odd shaped craft appear, hovering over the intersection. It seemed to be about 200 meters in diameter. Once I took my headphones out, I could hear an odd humming noise emanating from the object. It had orange and yellow lights in a pattern and appeared to be spinning quite fast. There was also an orangie-redish haze above and below the craft. The craft levitated for about 2 min., moving up, down, left and right. After it executed this manure, my Ipod shut off. This was strange because I had charged it fully before I left my house. The object hovered for another minuet and rose into the sky. It shot away at what seemed to be light-speed in a north-north-west direction. It was snowing when I had this sighting.

About 3 miles north of the Perimeter Hwy/Hwy 7 cloverleaf, a disc-shaped object suddenly flashed into existence through my windshield directly ahead of me about 45 degrees off the south horizon.  The object I estimated was perhaps above the cloverleaf and about 3,000 ft altitude.   Strangely, the east side of the object was brightly metallic, while the west side of the object was shadowy, which was I thought odd since the sun should have enhanced the west side of the disc. I was amazed to see something flash into existence as it did, and about 5 seconds later, it flashed out of existence.  I pulled off onto a side road a few seconds later and got out of the car.  I scanned the sky, but nothing was there.  I listened intently for a minute, but there was no sound of air traffic.  Usually, one can hear aircraft miles away in that type of weather condition.  I got back into the car and continued southbound down Hwy 7 and saw no other metallic discs. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Four bright lights travelling in a row at sunset.;2013-08-03 21:00:00;40 minutes;Four bright lights travelling in a row at sunset. We were diving home from the cottage at around 9:00PM on August 3rd. and the sun was setting. I noticed in the corner of my eye what at first I thought was a reflection on the power lines beside the road.  When I looked over I could see that these were not reflections, but lights in the sky.  There were four lights of equal brightness in a row, seeming to keep pace with us driving at about 100 km/h (65 mph.)  At one point the third and fourth objects were above and below each other for a time but otherwise they stayed in a row. I was driving, and my wife was taking the pictures with my phone.  Unfortunately we did not get a picture of object 3 and 4 above and below each other. The light seemed to be reflected by the objects, it did not appear that they were producing the light themselves.  The brightness did seem to stay constant as the sun was going down however.  It looked almost like a small contrail in front and behind each object, and there was no colour or strobing/flashing visible, it looked like a very bright, white light as if sunlight reflected off a mirror. They slowly gained distance on us but it never seemed that they were actually moving.  They travelled in a westerly direction toward the City of Winnipeg where we live.  At one point an airplane could be seen travelling North to South, and it was clearly different from the objects, it did not produce the bright reflection and the contrail was visible. Our daughter also saw the objects, and said they looked like shooting stars.;49.8825541843973;-97.1534052482271
