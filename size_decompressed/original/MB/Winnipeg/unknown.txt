Blue light moving rapidly from N/W to S/E. Visible vapour trail, no vehicle visible. Duration approx. 10 seconds.;1999-09-26 23:30:00;10 Seconds;Blue light moving rapidly from N/W to S/E. Visible vapour trail, no vehicle visible. Duration approx. 10 seconds. I live in rural Manitoba Canada devoid of any City Lights or strets lights. On the night of (approximation) Sept. 26/ 99 at about 23:30, my eye caught a bright blue light moving at a very high altitude at an incredible speed from S/W to N/E Horizon. No vehicle or craft was visible, only the light was visible. There was a visible vapour trail that was obviously far behind (6 - 8 inches ground visibility) that couldn't keep up with the object. The object crossed the entire visible sky (no sound) in approx. 10 seconds. That's it.;49.8825541843973;-97.1534052482271
a dark object seen against face of sun.  disc in profile???;1999-12-24 11:00:00;20 min.;a dark object seen against face of sun.  disc in profile??? if you look on am map you will better know where i was.   i was on a greyhound bus going to my folks place for christmas.  i was on the 10:30(ish...) bus from winnipeg to kenora (ontario) on c-mas eve.  we were probably travelling at @ 100-110 km/h and i was on the passenger side in the pass. seat.  we were heading east.  the day was cold and partly cloudy.  i read some of my mag. and then watched the scenery.  i looked towards the sun as it was partly cloudy/overcast.  it was the kind of overcast that allows the sun to shine thru and see it as the true disc.  not fuzzy at all.  the edge of the sun was crisp.  (can i say it another way???)  i noticed in the disc of the sun to the right side abd just lower than the centre of the sun, a long black object.  it was over a quarter of the suns radius and less than half.  it was slim and the feeling i got was that i saw it in profile.  ie.it was a disc shape on edge to me or cigar shaped...but not rounded like a cigar on the ends.  it tapered to the bottom like many of the famous disc shaped objects seen.  (i can't remember off hand any famous ones by name but the pics taken by the california highway worker on profile edge kind of do it justice.)  it was 8-10 times longer than high.  and tapered to the bottom, not evenly between bottom and top.  (can i say this in another way???) this was seen for about 15-20 minutes at the speed given before.  my feeling at the time was that it was way far away as it didn't move in relation to the sun.  this would mean a LARGE object way far away to not show any paralax in my moving observation.  or it was closer but moving at a relative speed between me and the sun but closer. frank edwards in his book 'FLYING SAUCERS: SERIOUS BUSINESS' tells of an astronomer in mexico (book publ'd in late '60's '70's) who saw streams of objects between him and the sun like i observed.  except i saw one... for some reason i didn't confirm with anyone else on the bus. i can write to you by snail mail with topographical maps so you can get coordinates on where exactly i was and a sketch of what i saw... i heard of y'all on 'art bell'  (where else?...) and thought it was the perfect place to tell... E-m me for more if needed???   bu-bye;49.8825541843973;-97.1534052482271

Thats when I say 3 objects movine across the sky towards the south. They were in a triange formation, and rotating around each other. Then a 4th appeard and they broke formation, then 2 disapeared. and there was only 2 left. I called my brother to come look, i though i was too late, i thought they were all gone..then to my suprise, they kept coming, first one at a time, then 4 at a time, then six, all together i counted 16. All of them came from the NortEastern horizion and headed south. They looked like firworks at first, when they took off from the north, strait up in the air, but then when they took off to the south, i knew at once that they were not fireworks. We thought maybe they were jets.but no sound of jet engines could be here, even at time when there were 6 in the sky at one time. I have been checking web sites all over to see if anyone else saw what i saw. There was also a single engine air plane that seem to be trying to chase the objects.;49.8825541843973;-97.1534052482271
HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Object made a very quick and very sharp U-turn.;2003-07-06 21:30:00;approx:10 seconds;Object made a very quick and very sharp U-turn. It was 9:30 pm Sunday July 6th at the Hecla Provincial Park (120 miles north of Winnipeg)  My wife and I saw an aircraft travelling east.  It was very high in the sky as I could not identify aircraft wings and could barely discern the faint sound of jet engines.  The aircraft caught my eye because it was shining brightly (probably due to the reflection of sunlight at sunset) and I found it odd that there was no vapor trail from the jet engines.  The speed of the aircraft was constant (not unusually fast or slow).  The very strange aspect of this sighting was that the aircraft did a very quick and very sharp U-turn.  It took less than two seconds for the aircraft to change directions and begin flying on the same path it had been travelling.  I work in aviation and know that vapor trails are not always visible due to air temperatures but jet aircraft cannot change directions that quickly.  I hope someone else saw this as well.  Thank you to the witness for their report.  Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.

Bright red lightning over St. Norbert, Winnipeg!;2007-02-25 21:00:00;5 seconds;Bright red lightning over St. Norbert, Winnipeg! My friends and I were driving just outside the city, going to Trappist Monastery Provincial Heritage Park in St. Norbert.  As we where drinking  ((sic.  driving??)) down the gravel road, I looked up and saw what I thought was lightning off in the distance.  I told my friends, and we were all amazed by the fact we had lightning lighting up the sky in February!  Then the whole sky turned bright red!  Unlike any lightning I've ever seen!  The red filled the whole sky and it was very bright!  My friends or myself could not explain why we saw lightning or why it was red!  I'm baffled!;49.8825541843973;-97.1534052482271
object moving over Winnipeg Sky;2008-06-24 14:20:00;10 sek;object moving over Winnipeg Sky I was sitting in my living-room and happened to glance out through the north window. I saw an small object in the sky. Approx at a 40-50 degree angle from ground..  I first thought it was an airplane or bird hovering, but this coght my interest when it began moving, like irregular sudden changes in direction I went to my window, and saw the same object shoot over the sky toward south, not far, maybe a km or so, hard to determine. Suddenly  it did a sharp turn west, toward Winnipeg airport. It was moving so quickly it took just a few seconds to  dissapear from my view, because of trees in the neighborhood. I then went outside, and was watching the sky for approx. 2 minutes, and then I saw it again, return from west side of the city. It just came back for a few seconds and made a quick circle on the sky and flew west direction.  It is a  sunny day, blue skies, with a light haze at western and northern horizon. What facinated me was the incredible fast speed the object was moving and sudden turns. It was not an airplane, or a bird, because of the incredible high speed it was moving. what I saw, I don`t have a clue. I will be watching the skies today and tonight.;49.8825541843973;-97.1534052482271

Higher than satellites that I usually see. Moved at various speeds and directions within the space of the big dipper as seen from south winnipeg. Moved north from the last star on the handle and back to the star on the bottom of the dipper bucket then south and back west speed ranged from slow to very fast and not in straight lines. These  craft were very high. I frequently see satellites and the space station but these were far higher and only visible as dots. They were not aircraft.;49.8825541843973;-97.1534052482271

While outside I noticed a solid shiney silver object in the sky.  I watched it for about 2minutes and realized that it wasn't a plane and it wasn't moving so I ran inside to get my camera.  When I returned I looked for it in the same area and found it again, I proceeded to take several pictures with my 300mm zoom.  I am afraid the pictures are still fuzzy but the object is clearly visible, then the craft shot out another object which flew away from it at great speed the main craft then left the area slowly and I lost track of it!;49.8825541843973;-97.1534052482271

Unfortunately I couldn't follow it because I was in my way to attend an emergency. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5pj2rifTFU&list=UUZH_l1SnJS4vqUWbs-ZtuGA&index=1&feature=plcp   ALSO I HAVE OTHER SIGHT THE PREVIOUS DAY. ATTACHED THE VIDEO   Before go to bed at 11:30 went out an object very bright passed on top of my house in direction SE.   I run to pick up my camera but unfortunately I didn't have a chance to setup the focus and I didn't pay attention that was in night shot position due the emotion. I run to mi car and cross part of the city to find open spot.  I found the object going in the same direction but I didn't have enough time to get out the car before it hide from the trees.  This is my first sight after 40 years waiting for that. Was white  bright like a Venus   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFGxoo8htE0&feature=relmfu;49.8825541843973;-97.1534052482271
Strange light.;2020-02-18 02:45:00;10 minutes;strange light At about 245am after not being able to sleep being restless I decided to go outside to get some fresh air and the night sky was clear at that time. I looked directly up to see the stars when I noticed what I thought to be a satellite passing across the sky.  To my disbelief the object stopped dead in its path then went into a turn like how a vehicle makes a u turn.  It started to may a circle like path.  I`ve seen satellites travel in the night sky but never seen anything do that and the speed which it moved fluctuated from what an airplane might travel to going fast like nothing I've ever seen.;49.8825541843973;-97.1534052482271
