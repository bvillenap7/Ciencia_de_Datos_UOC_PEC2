Black Triangle hovers over car in city (soundless), street lights went out, whoosh acceleration, then street lights  back on.;1977-10-24 19:00:00;1 minute;Black Triangle hovers over car in city (soundless), street lights went out, whoosh acceleration, then street lights  back on. My dad was driving me to a friend's house.  At a 4-way stop in the Garden City area of the city, I looked out the passenger window and saw a large triangular object hovering over our car.  It had rained earlier, there were low clouds, and sodium vapor lights made it quite bright in the dark. The triangular object was very dark gray against the lighter low clouds. I noticed black lines underneath it, arranged very like a circuit board.  It was motionless and soundless for about 15 seconds.  It then slowly moved across the street at the rate of a person walking across a street.  It hovered over the convenience store on the other side of the street and then the street lights went out in the vicinity.  I could see the glow of sodium vapor street lights over the city about 3 miles to the south, and the glow of street lights ahead of me approx. 2 miles to the west.  All other lights were out. The object continued to hover for about 10 seconds and then Whooshed a! way at a very accelerated rate ... like a cartoon whoosh.  When it was out of sight, the street lights in the vicinity came back on.  I noticed there were 1 or 2 cars at the 4-way stop.  We proceeded on our way.  My dad and I did not speak, which afterward I thought was very strange.  We only discussed it the day after.  My dad saw the same object and behavior, but he saw lights around the object - which I did not.  About me: I was about 15 years old at the time of this incident (and an excellent student).  My dad was a professional symphony musician. I am a Systems Engineer and an alumna of an Ivy League school.;49.8825541843973;-97.1534052482271

Weird triangle shaped object with 3 oval shaped things on the back which got small to big, no sound, slow moving.;2005-09-24 22:00:00;5 minutes;Weird triangle shaped object with 3 oval shaped things on the back which got small to big, no sound, slow moving. My friend had phoned me at around 9:30 when he got off of work for me to start walking to his house and meet him there because we were going to chill, i left my house at around 9:45 pm. As i came close to where i was going i seen some weird blinking lights in the sky, 2 would blink blue and the middle one was blinking red. I stoped an started looking at it closer, what i thought was the front but turned out to be the back looked like 3 oval shaped things starting small from the left getting bigger as it goes right. It was a blueish colour, at first that was all i could see untill everything started to blink. At first i thought maybe its a aircraft, but there was no sound and it was kind of slow moving. When it passed over top of me i could make out a triangle shape when it blinked.  The blinking would start from the left on I guess a wing or a side of it, it was a blue blink, then it would go to the other side of it with another blue blink, then in the front with a red blink. Would go fast an slow ect, it got out of my sight so i kept walking, when i as walking down my friends street the last thing i saw of it was behind the houses an it looked like it was getting lower.  When i reached his house he had just got there, i told him what i seen and he said he had seen the same thing walking back to his house.;49.8825541843973;-97.1534052482271
Triangular aircraft flies RIGHT ABOVE OUR CAR over the highway, and makes absolutely no noise.;2006-09-23 20:30:00;5 minutes;Triangular aircraft flies RIGHT ABOVE OUR CAR over the highway, and makes absolutely no noise. Me and my brother were driving south from Ste. Adolphe down Ste. Mary's Road in the country when I pointed out to him that there was a light in the sky to our right and that no tower or light of any kind had ever been there before.  We didn't think anything of it but kept our eyes on it.  All of the sudden the light appeared in the field about a hundred feet in front of us and about 150 to our left.  I started getting a little bit worried, and me and my brother both started to wonder and panic a little.  All of the sudden the light started moving very slowly but straight west from the field toward the road (we were travelling south).  It proceeded to travel at about 30 kilometres an hour (I was going regular high way speeds, but was so fixated on the light that my brother had to scream at me to stay in the right lane).  The aircraft travelled RIGHT ABOVE US!  My brother opened the window and looked directly up at the aircraft, and I stared at it as it went by.  We both said at the same time, What is that thing!!??  We both saw that it was triangular, with one main light on the bottom of it in the middle and one small light on each of the 3 sides of the aircraft.  IT IS ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL TO NOTE THAT THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO NOISE BEING EMITTED FROM THE AIRCRAFT!!  No whoosing noise, no noise of an engine, absolutely nothing, and the aircraft was so close, only maximum a couple hundred feet up.  It then kept on going towards the river.  We watched it for a bit, it turned right, then went back, then repeated that a couple of more times, and then disappeared.  We have absolutely no idea what it was, but whatever it was, neither of us have ever seen anything like it.
