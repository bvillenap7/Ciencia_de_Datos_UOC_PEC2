Red circular object changes colour and speeds up and changes direction slightly.;2001-12-19 18:45:00;15 seconds;Red circular object changes colour and speeds up and changes direction slightly. We were traveling South on McGregor Street ( main thorougfare ) in the North end of the city when we noticed what appeared to be a red light traveling at a 45 degree angle from the East moving swiftly SSE. At first sight we thought it was perhaps a meterorite however it changed colour from red to white and became more brilliant just after changing colour. As the brilliance intensified it also increased it's speed significantly to twice the speed it had been originally moving and also changed direction slightly by perhaps one or two degrees. At the same time there was a plane in the sky moving from the west towards the east and this object seemed to pass under it rapidly. The temperature outside was approximately minus 12C and the sky was clear as we could see a few stars. ((NUFORC Note:  Please see other reports from this date.

I'm bewildered. I don't have a clue as to what i've just seen it make no logical sense!;2003-04-07 22:47:00;a couple of seconds;I'm bewildered. I don't have a clue as to what i've just seen it make no logical sense! i saw a light facing ((sic--racing ?)) downwards cross the sky in amazing speed but there was not a sound to be heard. It crossed the sky in a south to north direction. When it crossed some clouds there was no reflection or glare distributed. The light was as bright as the moon but there's no explaination for this and i've thought of many! Could you help me i feel like i'm losing it!;49.8825541843973;-97.1534052482271
The object was around 4-5 ft in diameter had a silver center and darker colored chrome balls or like disks around the middle of it.;2003-08-23 18:45:00;30 sec;Me,My wife and 10 yr old son were traveling south on highway #7 about 8 klm from Winnipeg. about 18:45 pm. <Sky was clear sunny day good visibility strong winds> I saw this object heading north west very low to the ground. I was watching it and couldn't make out what it was.As it approached the highway it turned and headed north. It was flying about 80-100 feet above the highway between the two lanes.It was passing the on coming traffic so i estimated the speed to be around 140-150 klm hr. As it got close to the cars on the road it would flip on its side as it went passed them almost like it was looking at them. It then approached our truck.We were driving right at it when it flew right over top of the truck. I lost site of it as i was the driver and couldn't turn around safely to watch it. My wife then told me the <what ever it was> turned to the west and was climbing upwards at a high rate of speed. she watched it until it was gone. From the time it passed over us until it was no long visible only took secounds.The object was around 4-5 ft in diameter had a silver center and darker colored chrome balls or like disks around the middle of it.There was lots of traffic on the highway at this time and I'm sure others must have seen this thing.I did report this to the Winnipeg airport airtraffic control center and they gave me the name and number of a person to contact.I did and they said they would check it out.This was the most bizzar thing i have ever seen in my life had i been alone i wouldn't have told anyone because they wouldn't have believed it.  thanks for your time.;49.8825541843973;-97.1534052482271
Winnipeg Sighting - North-East Sky -;2006-06-02 23:00:00;10 sec;Winnipeg Sighting - North-East Sky - On Friday night, I was playing Texas Hold'em with my wife and a close friend when I notice an object in the sky surrounded by a Neon Green glow. I say the object in the Eastern sky through the opened balcony door. I ran out onto the balcony and the object seemed to be flying north. It appeared that the object was flying not much faster than most satellites. At one point it seemed it jumped up and then continued going north. I am not sure if there were clouds out that night of not, but I lost the object in the North-East sky.  At the time of the sighting, I was in my friend's home located in St. Boniface (Winnipeg) near the intersection of Tach√© and St. Mary' Rd.

Stationary light takes off!;2013-05-08 01:00:00;40 seconds;Stationary light takes off! I was watching the stars and saw one that didn't fit the constellations.  It also wasn't a planet, as it was bigger than a planet close to us or a star.  It also wasn't the space station. So I was just curious and just watched it.  The object, around 1:41 AM just took off from a stand still and proceeded North, so I tried to grab my digital camera and video it as it went from the South side of my house to the North side but it was to no avail, as I don't have a great zoom on it, and it proceeded Northbound out of me sight.  But, I know what I saw and it was not normal.  I am not saying it was alien, but it was a UFO.;49.8825541843973;-97.1534052482271

Three bright orange circular lights in the eastern sky at about 70 degrees.;2015-12-12 21:30:00;4 minutes;Three bright orange circular lights in the eastern sky at about 70 degrees.  Largest one was in the center and appeared higher than the two side smaller orange lights.  All moved oddly, not an airplane or a helicopter motion.   I thought they were too close to be helicopters (dangerous) and it was night.   We were driving  and lost sight of the three for a minute and when we stopped and got out of the car and we watched the remaining large orange ball which was stationary, then it began to rise up into the sky and quickly disappeared (out of sight).   Heard a sound but didn't think it was from the remaining large orange ball.  Very unusual.   Could be 10-15 miles west of the longitude and latitude centre of the North American continent.;49.8825541843973;-97.1534052482271
