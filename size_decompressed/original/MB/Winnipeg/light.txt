Beautiful ball of light instills awe;1991-11-20 21:00:00;unsure;Beautiful ball of light instills awe I was nine years old, sharing a room with my sister. It was about nine or so at night, November of 1991, we had been sent to bed for the evening and couldn't sleep. I have always been a 'skywatcher' and had the venetian blinds pulled up. We were on the second story of an apartment duplex, overlooking a man-made 'lake'. About thirty minutes after nine or so (it's hard to be sure of the exact time as I didn't have a watch and there were no clocks in the room) I saw what I at first assumed was a very bright 'star' over the lake. As I watched, it began to speed at an incredible rate toward me. I woke my sister up, and we watched as it came closer and closer. It finally stopped at about five feet from our bedroom window, and was quite small. About the size of a VW beetle, at most. It made no noise as it hung there, and I remember saying over and over again Wow...wow...wow... neither me or my sister could believe what we were seeing. It might've been saucer-like in shape, but was covered in many bright lights, which made it difficult to ascertain it's real shape. It had two appendages coming off the sides, which ended in two, very bright, bluish-indigo lights. Along the front it had the brightest yellow-white lights I've ever seen in my life, but it did not hurt to look into them. It also filled me with a sense of incredible joy and awe, and I feel now as if I could've spent the rest of my life just staring at this craft. There was no fear or apprehension whatsoever. About three hours later (by my best estimate) the thing left just as it had appeared- very quickly and suddenly. I felt numbed by the experience, but also deeply content. The reason I assume it was there for three hours was that, shortly after it's departure, my Mother entered our bedroom to check on my sister and I, and was irritated to find us still awake. It felt to have only 'visited' us a few seconds, though, or at the most, minutes. Even though I was an incredibly skeptical child before this incident (and still am, for most things) thi! s event instilled in me a definite belief in the existence of ETs and an insatiable thirst for knowledge pertaining to UFOlogy. I have never reported this event officially before.;49.8825541843973;-97.1534052482271
red ball in sky;2000-04-01 22:00:00;45 seconds;red ball in sky I witnessed what I believe to have been a UFO. At first I thought it was a sattelite, but the object heading south out of the north sky quickly changed direction to the west for about 15-20 seconds then switched back to a southerly direction at which time it dissapeared into some clouds and i lost sight of it.;49.8825541843973;-97.1534052482271
While getting ready for bed I noticed these lights that zoomed across the sky in various movements, it was not a shooting star;2000-04-28 23:59:00;5 minutes;While getting ready for bed I noticed these lights that zoomed across the sky in various movements, it was not a shooting star I was getting ready for bed and just happened to look outside the window.  I spied to what I thought was a meteor or a shooting star, when this star or meteor started to move in a line, then jumped all over the sky.  There were abour 3-5 lights in a row, it may have been one space craft or maybe more in a line. But the lights kept getting brighter, and brighter and brighter.  So bright they began to hurt my eyes.  Then after the big flash of light occured the light started to dim then it disappeared.  Two minutes later, it came back and zoomed back and forth across the sky.  This lead me to believe that this was not a shooting star or meteor.  This craft appeared over the houses across the street in the west direction.;49.8825541843973;-97.1534052482271

star-like  object hovering in night-sky;2002-08-06 04:00:00;1minute;star-like  object hovering in night-sky I was sleeping in the garden in a mosquito-tent. I woke up approx.4am, didn`t have a watch available. I saw a star-like object (size of planet Venus) on the eastern sky. It didn`t move. Suddenly the star-like object flared up to double it`s size, shining brightly for some 10-15 seconds. It than dimmed the light slowly, till no more than a very weak, almost non-existing star-light. The object than began moving towards north. It than dissapeared. Light of object was white. Clear night. Sighting of object was approx. 45 degree above horizon. Altitude, very high, maybe 30-000 feet. No sound, no sign of aircraft-lights. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness might have seen the characteristic flare of an Iridium satellite, but they do not stand still in the morning sky.

satellite? meet airplane;2002-10-09 20:55:00;15 sek;satellite? meet airplane I just went outside in the garden. I observed an airplane heading  in direction to west. A starlike object, which may have been a satellite was at same time heading in a eastern direction. The airplane and satellite(?), met right on. It looked like the satellite passeed under the airplane. A few seconds later, the  light of the satellite faded away quickly and was gone. The airplane, was flying very high altitude. Absolutely clear night. What made me question what I saw, was the direction this satellite was heading, and to my eyes, it looked like it was passing directly under the airplane. This happened on the western sky , about 70 degree above horizon. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a coincidence.  Airplanes fly at tens of thousands of feet altitude satellites are at least 100 miles above ground level.  PD));49.8825541843973;-97.1534052482271

Manitoba UFO;2004-09-18 04:30:00;1-2 Hours;Manitoba UFO The light seemed to move toward and away from us in the northeast sky. We watched it for about 45 mins from inside and went outside for 20 mins to get a closer look. It moved without moving, almost as if it were a star, but much brighter. We also noticed the stars around it definitly not moving at the same speed. We are students and I have been an armchair astronomer for years.;49.8825541843973;-97.1534052482271
very brief streak of bright light moving at an incredible speed from south to north over winnipeg.;2004-09-26 23:30:00;1 second;very brief streak of bright light moving at an incredible speed from south to north over winnipeg. I I just stepped out of the house to walk the dogs and im not even sure why I looked up , maybe to see if there was any northern lights...the size  speed and intensity of it COULD have been a meteorite, but i think anything that bright, that fast and seemingly near to the earth SHOULD've left a vapor trail like some of those seen during a meteor shower. But there was none, no vapor trail, no sound and no flash. It was more of a streak. It went from the corner from my left eye(i was looking west) straint NORTH and vanished behind the trees to the north...it seemed to be travelling parallel to the ground rather than on acollision coursefor the ground. I told somebody and they gave me this site. First time reporting anything. How ever I have seent two  triangles with lighted points in the past. Once in 77 near Gimli, and once over Banff nationalpark in winter 90-91. The gimli triangle hovered over a field about 150 ft the banff craft wenteastto west over lake louise.

Observerd around ten, bright, rapidlly moving objects in a late afternoon sky.;2005-11-02 16:10:00;45sec to 1min.;Observerd around ten, bright, rapidlly moving objects in a late afternoon sky. A few min. after 4pm. in Winnipeg, on Nov.2nd, 05, a friend and I were looking up at an unusually dark eastern sky as we stood in her front lawn.  About to turn away and leave my friend said, look at that.  She was pointing up at the eastern sky.  Four to five exceedingly bright lights were rapidly moving back and fourth against the sky's dark background.  We had never seen anything like this before.  The star-like objects were 'proforming' as it were, a correografic dance in the sky, so it seemed to me, as they swooped at impossible speeds towards one another, then at angles, speed away again.  Some also seem to briefly hover in space before converging repeatedly in circles around one another.  Amazingly, my eyes were drawn to moving lights that I could see through the leafless branches of a nearby tree ajacent to the group I was looking at.  There were at least five more doing the same manuevers in that part of the sky.  This phenomina lasted for about minute or less before the objects shot away from veiw in all directions.  I would estimate the objects to have been several kilometers from our observation location. I am a retired ((deleted)) teacher, 6X years old. My friend, 7X, is a retired ((deleted)) therapist who worked in a large ((deleted)) hospital.;49.8825541843973;-97.1534052482271
Seeing UFO'S in Manitoba.;2009-06-25 23:00:00;5-8 minutes;Seeing UFO'S in Manitoba. OK!  Well,so far I have seen these almost 2-3 times a week or more over the past year.Just happened upon this site so I wanted to make this documented because if anyone else sees this too I won't feel like I am going crazy!I have started to question my faith and looked into Bible/UFO/Historical findings.The objects look like stars,they are way up in the sky.I look at the stars alot and can notice these things alot.Most times they start in the west and go east,a couple times it has been south to North.The way I notice is,I am just standing outside having a smoke.Because I don't smoke indoors.I look at the sky and just stare at the stars,and then if you look around an really stare at them.It moves,it is slow.Sometimes they float like a feather,and then all of a sudden turn red like it is a falling star burning.Sometimes they just move and stay put.But not for long,just a couple minutes then they move into space and disappear.Sometimes there is more than one and they kinda play around with eachother,in a circular tag game style.They look like stars,even higher than the visable stars.Having no other appearance,just white glowing star like quality.No other lights flashing at all.And they are a mystery to me.But I know it is something.Must be ufo's??

Light in sky over Winnipeg, Canada.;2010-07-04 01:00:00;5 minutes;Light in sky over Winnipeg. Canada. I was sitting on the couch watching TV, when my little brother came storming down yelling for me to follow him outside,   So I got up and ran with him to the back of our home, and he told me to look up.   We were looking at what appeared to be some sort of object crossing the city horizon, it looked as big as the space station on a clear night when the station almost looks like a big star, and it was a faint orange color.   As I stood in awe,my little brother ran and got my dad, he too witnessed the object.  It was heading due east, almost appeared to be following the clouds which were heading in the same direction.   Anyways, when i noticed this thing in the sky, it came fast but then it was almost like it noticed us, and kinda slowed down, then stopped completely only for a few seconds then slowly gained momentum, and continued on east.    This isn't a hoax, I truly believe these things have been observing us for sometime, back in the 90's not sure what year, I witnessed a triangular object much like those been described countless times with the 3 lites on each point.   I never told anyone about that, anyways, this thing was like Just over the house.   Hovering, again i just recalled this, it was cloudy?  I wonder if thats a coincidence.  This Object headed North, I can remember this because it was across from my old elementary school, and I remember watching this thing glide to the north.    I hope this was what u wanted, I needed to get this out there, and share my sighting with whom ever wanted to know.   Happy findings, and good luck.;49.8825541843973;-97.1534052482271

Strange orange light flew overhead.;2016-10-02 01:30:00;1-2 minutes;Strange orange light flew overhead. 	On the morning of October 2, 2016, at just before 1:30 AM, I wandered over to the open shipping door at my workplace to grab a bit of fresh air.   I was looking outside when an orange light caught my attention.  The light was to the southeast of where I was standing.  I assumed it was an aircraft coming in to land at the airport—this is something that I see at night all the time as my workplace is just to the east of the airport.  The light was about the same size and color as the incandescent street lamps that were across the street, maybe 100 feet away. 	As the light approached I became very curious.  When normal aircraft do their approaches you often start out seeing just the bright white 'headlight' but you eventually see the red and green lights on the wings and tail.  This object did not display any other lights.  The light continued heading directly towards me, flying on a northwest course.  As it was going to pass directly over the building I went outside into the parking lot so I could continue observing it. 	The light passed directly over me at what I assumed was the normal altitude for landing aircraft.  I did not see any other lights—just the orange light.  I did not see the shape of an aircraft which is very strange to me as at that altitude I would have seen at least the outline of a conventional aircraft, even at night.  There was no sound.  The light did not change shape or luminosity.  It moved at roughly the same speed as a normal aircraft.  There was a light breeze at the time but I don't recall the direction. 	As the light passed overhead I saw what looked to me like a 'shock-wave' in front of the light.  This was the only time I saw anything other than the light itself.  The light continued on its northwest course, moving past the roof-line of the building.  I backed up in the parking lot to try to regain sight of it but failed to do so.  The total time spent observing the light was 1-2 minutes. 	I do not know what to think of this light.  I have worked nights at this location for over 5 years and have never seen anything like this.  I see normal aircraft in the sky at night all the time, several times a night.  This thing did not look like a normal aircraft.  I suppose it could have been a meteor but I feel it was moving too slowly for that.  I feel it was moving too precisely to be a balloon, flare or firework, and the light was too consistent and bright for that, unless I drastically overestimated its altitude.  I have a feeling that this is just a conventional phenomenon but it was weird enough to me and something I've certainly never seen before so I felt I should report it.;49.8825541843973;-97.1534052482271
2 parallel white lights travel south while being pursued by police helicopter;2018-05-10 23:30:00;8 seconds;2 parallel white lights travel south while being pursued by police helicopter while sitting in my hot tub in my back yard, i heard the familiar sound of the police chopper passing over the city. after it passed over our house, it made a few circles to the south of our location and after a few course adjustments, headed north at a higher rate of speed. about 10 seconds later, 2 lights with the same relative brightness of the background stars traveled parallel and at a constant rate of speed. the 2 lights travelled directly over our house out of the north in a SSE direction before i lost sight behind the neighbor's roofline. by scale, the lights appeared to be about the width of my fist apart at arm's length. within 5 seconds of the lights passing overhead, the helicopter came from the same northerly direction tracking SSE at reduced altitude and what appeared to be a pursuit mode. the conditions were mainly clear, with all major stars visible.;49.8825541843973;-97.1534052482271
