I was driving down waverly in winnipeg manitoba when i saw a cylinder shaped white craft flying in the air above my car of course a few hundred feet in front and also pretty high in the sky.  It did not leave any trails, nor were there any signs of propellers.  It made no noise and strangely did not cast a shadow as planes do.  It disappeared in the blink of an eye but i was able to observe it for a few minutes.  It did not appear to have any lights and as it was not dark you can see plane lights even in the daylight that is why i thought that was terribly wierd.  It almost appeared to hang in the air.  Not blimp like moving.  It was sortof just hanging for a few minutes and then shot off.  I was on my way to work at Stantec Engineering.  It was flying lower than a plane would fly.  Like as low as they fly when they are near the airport.;49.8825541843973;-97.1534052482271
