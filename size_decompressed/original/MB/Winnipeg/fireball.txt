2 orange balls flying west to east in perfect unison;2013-07-30 22:30:00;~1:00;2 orange balls flying west to east in perfect unison I took my dog out at approximately 10:30 PM on July 30, 2013. Looking up I noticed 2 orange balls coming my direction.  They were too low to be an airplane in my area and made no sound.  They did not flash or flicker, just a steady orange glow.  They were moving at a consistent pace west to east (too slow for an airplane, but too quick to be carried by the wind).  One was slightly ahead of the other and further south, but in close proximity to each other.  I did not notice any other shape with or around them.  I was able to watch them for approximately 1 minute until they past the tree line.  The entire time the presentation did not falter. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.

Fireballs moved steady and silently from east to west.;2013-09-21 20:45:00;half an hour;Fireballs moved steady and silently from east to west. First one was a single sighting.  Bright orange light like a fire then it went out but you can still see object moving.  Light from city reflected on underside of object making it visible but not bright enough to show on my phones video.   Objects moved at steady silent pace from the East to West.   The next 6 followed in same path and did same thing the last 2 came together one above the other with a big space between the one in front shut down its light and moved ahead, the lit one was very bright and they continued from East to West this way till we could not see them I recorded what I could but it is not very good quality.    As I type there are more moving across the sky.;49.8825541843973;-97.1534052482271
Orange lights over Winnipeg.;2014-05-14 21:50:00;33-35 seconds;Orange lights over Winnipeg On May 14, 2014 at 9:50pm (CST) I had noticed two orange balls of light in the sky, just hovering in one spot (40-45 degrees in the southwest sky in Winnipeg) and not moving. They also had an orange aura around them. I watched the objects for about 30 seconds and then watched the ball on the left move up a bit, with the other ball of light immediately following around one second later. The orange lights moved up for about three seconds and then fizzled out quickly. Lights appeared orange in color but have a whitish tinge in photos (shot with iPhone 5).;49.8825541843973;-97.1534052482271
