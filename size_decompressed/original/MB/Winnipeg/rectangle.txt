Rectangular craft that flew silently and could turn 90 degrees while continuing on same heading and same speed.;2005-07-15 23:30:00;30 seconds;Rectangular craft that flew silently and could turn 90 degrees while continuing on same heading and same speed. My wife and I were taking a study break on our balcony. We both looked up and saw a rectangle craft flying silently not far above the buildings. It was quite dim but we could definitely make out the shape of the craft and there were 2 small square lights at both ends of the craft. The craft was flying width wise.  It flew silently, turned 90 degrees to length wise while keeping the same heading and speed, then turned back to width wise also keeping the same heading and speed. It continued silently, went past the end of our apartment building and disappeared. My wife and I were stone sober and are both rational people. We both watched the craft for until it disappeared.  We didn't say anything for a second and then I asked her what she saw. We both saw the same thing.  We talked at length about the 90 degree turn we both saw. Not sure what it was.  I would have reported it years ago but just came across this site. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));49.8825541843973;-97.1534052482271
Two square shaped objects with flashing lights in each corner flying incredibly fast and changing direction at unbelievable angles.;2010-07-11 23:38:00;1 hour +;Two square shaped objects with flashing lights in each corner flying incredibly fast and changing direction at unbelievable angles. I was driving in a car on the south perimeter highway of Winnipeg, Manitoba with my friend  and his girlfriend in the front seats.  As we were passing the Brady landfill, she noticed  something in the sky and asked what it was.  After a quick glance me and my friend said its  just an airplane, but after taking a second look we realized that it did not look at all like an  airplane.   The object looked very low in the sky and was a four cornered shape with lights in  each corner.  In one corner the light flashed back and forth from green and red.  We pulled  over on the side of the highway to get a better look and try and record it on our phones, as we  did this the object started accelerating quickly west and then turned very suddenly and flew  north, across the city, very fast.  As this object left, another one appeared from the east, and  flew west across the sky, before turning north, seemingly towards the airport, but ended up  staying in one spot high in the sky, which appeared to be west of the city towards the north. The second object stayed in this position for as long as I could watch it after that, which was  at least an hour, and it glowed brightly in the sky, clearly with blue/green and red lights.
