I was in a convertible riding passenger heading East on Mayfair Ave towards the Forks at Main and the new bridge when I noticed a bright object in the North East part of the sky.  It looked similar in brightness to Regulus in the Constellation Leo if it were in the night sky with the exception this was daylight. After observing it for several minutes trying to determine whether it was perhaps a mylar balloon we noticed that it remained stationary and appeared to be getting larger (as if it were descending). We took turns viewing it so we would not succumb to an optical illusion.  We pulled over on Main towards the turnoff into the Forks at Earl's on Main just past the CN Station. Using the moon as a reference point, it was about  6 inches off the 8 o'clock position and now moving towards the SW. It had become larger in appearance and looked almost like 2 balls turning clockwise slowly around each other and was now emanating a  bright reddish light. The reddish light went from a single distinct light to 3 lights then back to a single light then into 2 lights and back into 3 lights.  We continued to observe it as it once again seemed to stop moving and hovered in a stationary position emanating these same lights. I also notice that it seemed to now be rising in height becoming once again smaller. It had changed to a darker colouration with a silver edge and now looked like an oval solid object with some sort of field surrounding it making it appear very dark as if it had a shadow.   It started moving towards the east for a few moments and then stopped and began to rise further into the sky. We watched it for a few more minutes as it continually became smaller yet remained as a brilliant star looking object, then began moving off towards the North where it disappeared from sight.;49.8825541843973;-97.1534052482271
