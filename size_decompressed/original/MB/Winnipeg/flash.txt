The craft was fast and strobing.;2002-03-27 21:00:00;45 seconds;The craft was fast and strobing. My mother and I saw the craft outside our home window.  We live on a river bank and the object was flying quite high.  Aircraft come in all the time as we are quite close to the airport.  The ufo wasn't going in the normal directions every single other plane does.  It was going in either a North or North East direction and was very very fast!  I tried my best to reason out what this thing exactly was.  I checked for reflections in the window, and there wasn't any lightening.  The craft didn't appear all of the time, but it looked like a strobe light moving across the sky.  The strobing pattern was sequenced, so that rules out any natural occurances in nature.  The light itself was white.  Its flight path was perfectly straight, but accelerated upward at times.  (Also, it went behind some buildings)  The flight path was very linear!  The very next day my father head a ufo report on the radio, but this one was in Phoenix, described the exact same way as my sighting.;49.8825541843973;-97.1534052482271
