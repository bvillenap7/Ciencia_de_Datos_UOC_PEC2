Observation of 7 events consisting of several lights flying very, very fast in formation.;2004-05-16 23:30:00;1 hour;Observation of 7 events consisting of several lights flying very, very fast in formation. This is a description of 7 events over a period of 1 hour. Each event lasted approximately 3 seconds and were 5 - 10 minutes apart. All observances were from my deck at the rear of my house. Sky was clear with no clouds. Temperature ~ 0C. All formation sightings went from south horizon to north horizon. Besides myself there was 1 other witness. All formations were travelling very, very fast and covered the horizons in ~3 seconds. The second event was the most spectacular. There was no sound from any of the events.  1. 7 - 8 lights flying very very fast in V-formation. Red in color. Looked like the formation was clouded in a mist. 2. Two groups of white lights travelling north. First group ~ 9 lights second group ~ 6 lights. Much lower than first sighting and much larger. Lights went from formation to dancing around each other before dispersing in different directions in the north. 3. Formation of 5 lights forming a V with 4 on 1 side and 1 on the other. Orange- white in color. 4. Formation of 3 lights, red in color. 5. Formation of 4 lights, white in color. 6. Formation of 4 lights, white in color. 7. Formation of 5 lights, white in color.  At this time we retired for the night.;49.8825541843973;-97.1534052482271

The one object in the back left corner of the formation zigzaged back and forth but stayed in the vicinity of the other 2, after about 3 or 4 seconds after they disappeared a jet flew off in the same direction.;49.8825541843973;-97.1534052482271
