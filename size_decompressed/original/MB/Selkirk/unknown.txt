Blue fireball moving at great speed (Canada);2012-03-27 21:15:00;5-10 seconds;Blue fireball moving at great speed Tuesday March 27 2012 21:15 (after dusk) Hwy 9 between Selkirk bypass and Clandeboye MB (Canada), traveling NW (Highway runs SE to NW) Weather cold light drizzle, light overcast, temp on truck thermometer +2C. A flash to my left caught the corner of my eye and I looked out left side window. While scanning the sky I noticed a bright bluish white fireball in the side mirror (pickup truck, mirror is larger than normal car mirror). It was low, below the cloud cover, moving almost directly away (SE) at a great rate of speed and was diminishing in size. It disappeared over a horizon tree line. There was no tail trace (as with falling stars). I suspect military aircraft using afterburner someone else should have heard or seen this. Is this possible to confirm?;50.1424;-96.8888
