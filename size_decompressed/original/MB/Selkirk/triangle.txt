Three red lights on triangular shapped craft or 3 seperate objects in triangle formation!;2002-06-02 23:30:00;4-8 seconds;Three red lights on triangular shapped craft or 3 seperate objects in triangle formation! I was in my backyard reading a book by candle light on the 2nd of June 2002 at about 11:00-11:30 PM CST. I don't know the exact time becasue I stayed outside for a while after I saw it to see if it would come back again. When I'm reading a book I take a break after each chapter to have a cigarette and to think about what I have just read. After completing the 1st chapter of the book The Stranger I stopped and had my break. While I was smoking my cigarette I was gazing into the sky as it was one of the clearest nights I have seen recently and saw something that I could not explain! I saw what was either a triangular shapped craft or three crafts flying in a triangular formation. I don't know whether it was just one or multiples because I was unable to make out any part of the structure only three red lights. I am not an aviation expert at all but I am fairly certain that it was not a airplain as the object(s) was alot closer than planes usually fly and it was one of the fastest moving objects I have ever seen in my life. I am extremly skeptical about these types of things and would appreciate if someone would be able to clear this up for me. I have been searching the net since I saw the object(s) and the closest picture I could find was this one http://www.totalufo.net/ufos/pics/belgufo.htm but there was no middle light and I was unable to make out and defined shape like the one in this picture which is why it could have been three seperate objects. Extra Information: It didn't occur to me until later but there was a problem with the TV changing inputs and turning on and of after I had come inside. Think this might be nothing but it had never happend bofore.;50.1424;-96.8888
