8-10 red orbs crossing the sky;2016-09-10 22:00:00;4-5 minutes;8-10 red orbs crossing the sky My husband took our dog out for his nightly bathroom routine.  In the sky, travelling from SE to NW at approximately a 45 degree angle from the horizon, he saw red orbs travelling at a pace like a small plane and he called me out to see them.  There was absolutely no associated noise with these orbs passing at intervals of approximately 30-45 second intervals - the preceding orb would still be visible when the next was starting its path and there was no deviation in the arc of the path nor the speed of the movement.  On one occasion, there were 2 lights travelling together but spaced apart to a distance that would appear too great for both lights to belong to one recognizable source.;50.1424;-96.8888
