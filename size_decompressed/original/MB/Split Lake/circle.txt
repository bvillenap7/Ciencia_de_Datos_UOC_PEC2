The light was not moving from point A to B but it was rotating all the colours on the colour spectrum. IT was in the air over the lake. I seen the same thing in the same area a few years back. My question is why here? Our population is barely over a thousand people. We are in the middle of nowhere. The nearest industrial-infrastructure is Kelsey Hydro Electric Generating Station Twenty miles south east of here. The nearest city is Thompson, Manitoba Thompson sits on the mother load of nickel and it is about one hundred miles south of us. I am a University graduate with a degree in Political Science. I will be attending Law this fall. Any ideas?;56.25;-96.1
