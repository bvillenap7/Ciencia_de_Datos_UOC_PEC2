When 13 & 15 came around the house it seemed that there was a time shift.   It had become completely dark and all 13 & 15 saw was a flash straight up the sky faster than you could blink your eye.   When we met 14 & 16 we were all in shock.   I was 13 at this time and am now 57.   At this present time 14 & 16 do not recall this time that happened.  Not sure if they want to admit this.   15 has died of heart attack.;50.9994;-96.9938

I then came into the house to tell my husband,we both went back outside, I showed him where in the sky I had seen this.  A few minutes past and I then noticed in the North sky a bright light that kept getting closer,bigger and brighter,and then it faded away very small in appearance and looked like it was travelling north,and then it was no longer visable.;50.9994;-96.9938
