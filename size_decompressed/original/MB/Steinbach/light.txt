One round ball of light falling towards earth.;2019-12-17 22:26:00;10-15 seconds;One round ball of light falling towards earth. First, let me say I don't know if this was a craft, or a falling star. On December 17 2019. While driving down the 52 Highway heading towards Steinbach, Manitoba, at 10:26 pm or 22:26â€¦ After the event I looked at the clock in the vehicle. What I saw...A ball of light falling at a great speed towards the ground, it lasted only a few seconds 10- 15 seconds then very quickly dimmed out of sight.  As if a dimmer switch was quickly used and then it was out. This light was circular had no tail or trail behind it.  Only one was seen. I do not know the height it was falling from.  I would say it appeared to be lower then an airplane would be. It was not extremely bright, more dull but still bright enough that I clearly saw it.;49.5291;-96.6851999999999
