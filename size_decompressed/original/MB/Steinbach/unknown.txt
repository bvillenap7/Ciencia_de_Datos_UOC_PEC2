It was a cloudless sky. Just out side of New Bothwell Manitoba on May 8th 2012 about 2100 hours.  In the distance I saw a pulsating bright white light, flying fast and as high as a small aircraft would be. I saw no shape to this lighted object. It was blinking it blinked 3 times very quickly then moved forward. It was not flying in a straight line, nor was its speed consistent. After its three pulsating blinks, it looked as if it took a new position, then the 3 blink’s before. Sometimes slightly higher or lower, or further ahead then the movement before. It was moving very fast heading towards Steinbach Manitoba. I was driving as fast as I safely could, but it was soon far way in the distance. The blinking light was just as bright far way, as it was close up. I also noted that there was no smoke stream coming from the rear, nor was there any sound.;49.5291;-96.6851999999999
