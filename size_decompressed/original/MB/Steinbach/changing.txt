What the hell was that?;2002-08-26 00:00:00;4 min.;What the hell was that? A really bright low flying object far off in the horizon. Much too low to be a plane. Started 90 degree turns upward. About three turns. This of which caught my attention because planes don't fly like this. When it stopped it seemed to gather it's energy. Turned really bright than for a second we could see that it had a gold colour to it. It almost seemed liquid. Than it took off at an amazing speed. No sound. There was clouds in the night sky and I could see that it penetrated the clouds. I've never seen something like this and I know that what I saw was not what we are accustomed to seeing flying in our skies.;49.5291;-96.6851999999999
