I went out for a cigarette and before I lit it I looked up and saw three lights in a perfect triangle the triangle in between the lights was darker than the normal night sky and it was rotating at a constant speed while maintaining the triangle shape. It was just below the big dipper so it stood out because I usually look at the stars when I'm outside. I looked down for a couple seconds to light my cigarette and when I looked back up it was gone.;49.9444;-96.8379
