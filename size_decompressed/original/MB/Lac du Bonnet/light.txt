Strange orange glow coming from trees alongside highway.;2009-11-20 07:00:00;10 minutes;Strange orange glow coming from trees alongside highway. Last year, (I don't remember the exact date) I was driving to city early in the morning with my sister, the sun was just coming up the left and I just happened to glance out the passenger window to my right and noticed a very steady bright, orange glow coming up from behind the trees.   At first I thought maybe there was a forest fire, but I slowed down and we looked closer and saw that there was no smoke, just a strange orange glow like the sun was coming up behind the trees...but how can that be if the sun was on the total opposite side of us?   I also thought it could possibly be coming from some lights on a farm or something, but I don't think it's possible for a few lights on a farm to light up a whole area of the sky like that.   I travel along that same highway alot, but I have never seen that orange glow ever again. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD));50.268;-96.0522
