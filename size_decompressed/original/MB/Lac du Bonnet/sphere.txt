Sphere floating for 30 min.;2002-03-13 00:00:00;30 min;Sphere floating for 30 min. I saw one bright sphere that floated in the sky for 30 minutes. It was bright yellow in colour and made a humming noise. For the first 5 minutes it flew like a humming bird (moving in small movements), and then floated for 25 minutes and dissapeared.
