I looked up in the sky and I seen what looked to be a fireball, it was moving slow at first, it almost looked as if it grew in size or came closer.  I then called my mother on my cell and told her to look outside, her and my sister both observed this object. The object changed direction abruptly and sped up a little, it didnt appear to be moving at a fast rate.  I then proceeded to phone my father and told him to get his range scope, as I was telling him this the object either shrank or it went upwards out of the range of my vision.;55.7425;-97.8622
