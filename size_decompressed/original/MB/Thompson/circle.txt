Big red firey balls. seen multiple times on different occasion. 2 videos on my phone.;2012-06-24 01:00:00;5 minutes;big red firey balls. seen multiple times on different occaision. 2 videos on my phone. this is the third time ive seen it. my first time was around 10 at night while i was walking my son. the same red light hovered across the sky and dissapeared into the clouds moving too fast for an airplane. it waa a big red ball. almost like a fire ball. too big and bright for a plane. the second sighting was a lot like the first. but then my boyfreind called me from work telling me he say 5 of the same objects following one another through the sky. all in formation and from he was standing they were pretty close together. then last night (from the description above). i was on my balcony and i saw it again. it was alone. i called my boyfreind and work and he saw it as soon as he stepped outside. it dissapeered over my building but then... another one from the same direction started going east from the other one. then quickly changed paths to where the first one had gone and flew over my building also. i saw it. my boyfreind saw it. and his employee saw it. ! i would realy like to know what these strange firey balls are...;55.7425;-97.8622
