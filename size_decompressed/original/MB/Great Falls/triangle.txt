First and third object flew eastwards made a turn north east,north of my house second flew east in a more parallel line turning s.e;2011-12-15 21:00:00;10-12 minutes;first and third object flew eastwards made a turn north east,north of my house second flew east in a more parallel line turning s.e To whom it may concern,    In between approximately 8:50 pm and 9:05 I was outside smoking a cigarette and my friend had started his car, it’s a very clear night. With the lights on facing the north I looked to the west and thought I seen a satellite I pointed out and realized it was not a satellite because the shine of the sun would reflect upon from the west as I would see the shade side.  It seemed to look as if there were airplane lights on it but one red flash then the rear flashed after repetitively around once each per second we also seen three lights, the direction of the un identified object looked as if the lights were not on wings, there was also 2 white lights parallel to each other and another in front near red flashing light, we knew it was not an airplane because the lights in the rear and the direction of the plane would be going in opposite direction at the same time it also was changing directions just as the un identified object left sight we looked to the west again and seen a second object coming from the same direction possibly a little farther south, this object flew in almost a straight line but yet to be going faster than a satellite, it also had the same type of lighting not 1 minute later a third had come the same path as the first, as it turned north at what seemed the same co ordinates facing now south east we seen the first a little higher up but farther away as the third followed continuing north east, the second object had faded into the sky so that you couldn’t see the lights just the red flash per second.  These objects were all going the same speed as each other, yet to still be faster and lower flying than a satellite. Seemed the two were going towards Hudson bay after they turned and coming from Regina going to northern Quebec.   The size of the object looked larger than an airplane possibly wider than a transit bus’s length and possibly triple its length between the back and front may be larger in size it’s hard to give definite size th! ough seemed like it was flying low was hard to caption exact s! ize only seen its lights   My friend will also be mailing in a report shortly,  Best regards;50.4492;-96.0105
