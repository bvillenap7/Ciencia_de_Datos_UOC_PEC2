To the south of the highway I noticed 2 bright orange yellow lights in the nights sky.  I could see them the whole way down to highway to Neepawa.  They were too high in the sky to be farm lights or machinery in the field.  Very weird to see the lights the whole time I travelled along the highway.   Once I got to Neepawa you could not see the lights anymore due to the trees in town. I then travelled to the south end of town and I could still see the lights.  Very unusual.  No explanation. Creeped me out! I told my husband when I got home.  He said that during the day there were military aircraft flying over town.  Coincedence?  Who knows?  The lights did not appear to be flying at high speed.  And I have never seen a plane with such bright orange yellow lights.;50.2491;-99.8358
