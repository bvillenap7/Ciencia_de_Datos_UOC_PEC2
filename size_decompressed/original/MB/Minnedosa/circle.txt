After about 5 min the obect started but light stayed bright but I could it was farther away.  Parrel to the bigger light was another object (bluish) that was smaller and it appeared to be moving away also and disappeared before the larger one.  About 5 after 5 there were objects that looked like shooting stars but went extremly fast - and dissappeared.  The sky was clear no clouds - but very windy - the obect seemed to travel in a very straight line ((NUFORC Note:  Witness does not indicate accurately duration of sighting, but we wonder whether she might have been looking at a celestial body.
