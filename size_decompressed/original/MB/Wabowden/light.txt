Blue light seen near Thompson, Manitoba. zig zagged and diappeared behind horizon.;2005-12-28 19:40:00;5 seconds;Blue light seen near Thompson, Manitoba. zig zagged and diappeared behind horizon. The object which was observed was a light,blue light kind of thing. I saw it entering the clouds and it went through the clouds, leaving a light trail behind it. it looked like it had a controlled speed, like it wasn't just falling through the sky to the earth like space debri.The light came through the clouds and made a sharp zig zag about half the distance from the bottom of the clouds to the trees from where I was standing{diappeared behind the trees. When the blue light zig zagged, it maintained the same speed as if were travelling in a straight line. It did not travel in a straight line, it travelled in the same manner as a lightning bolt zig zag. After it zig zagged, I tapped my brothers shoulder and told him to tell me what that was, he said  I don't know ... A space ship I guess.  I ride in helicopters alot and around here, the clouds are usually about 300- 400 feet above the trees when there is a complete overcast. I figure the object landed or hit the ground or was doing some king of evasive manuver to avoid detection, who knows, but thats my first time seeing something like that. two other guys also saw it from 75- 100 feet away and we talked to them a few minutes later. We blurted out the time simutaneously and said the same time a couple minutes apart. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));54.9167;-98.6333
