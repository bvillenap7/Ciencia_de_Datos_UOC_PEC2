Strange lights flying across the sky;2020-08-26 23:00:00;3 hours;Strange lights flying across the sky We saw lots of lights flying across the sky From WSW to ENE.  They were flying faster than any aircraft could.  They appeared to fly in a slight side to side motion as they travelled. A large aircraft with flashing red and white lights which I presume was a passenger plane flying SE to NW appeared.  One of the lights then shot up to the north and appeared to wait for the aircraft.  As the aircraft got close, it flashed really bright like afterburners and and shot ahead of the aircraft and would become almost invisible.  As the aircraft got closer to where it disappeared it would light up again and shoot out ahead of the aircraft and disappear again.  This happened about 6 or 7 times until it disappeared for good.;51.654;-99.9162
