Suddenly this flash of light comes out of nowhere and disappears. I heard a popping sound as it entered the earth atmoshpere but my friends did not hear it for some reason. They told me to look right after I heard the popping crackling sound, and then I saw it, I bright white flash that appeared to be a comet or meteor but it suddenly stopped dead still. My friends were astonished at the sudden pause.  Holy crap! they replied, I couldnt believe it either.  Suddenly the spacecraft vanished into thin air.  A few weeks later I have a dream about men in black bombing us or saving us, one of the two. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.
