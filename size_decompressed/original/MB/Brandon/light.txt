((HOAX??  Date and time are flawed.))  Green light in clouds over Brandon MB.;2008-08-10 20:30:00;10 seconds;Green light in clouds over Brandon MB. One night as my mom and dad were driving back to our campsite near Brandon, I looked into the clouds and saw an unnatural green light that was always changing shape, sort of like water.  The light was moving fairly fast and smoothly. It always stayed inside the cloud.  It would stay in the cloud and then would disappear into another cloud. I only saw it for ten to fifteen seconds, until my dad turned the corner and I lost sight of it.  Then we turned another corner, I saw the cloud but the green light was gone. I do not know if anyone has seen the same thing I saw, if they did, and they read this, please post it so that I know that I’m not going crazy. Thanks ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.
