White dot teleports in a triangular motion...unbelievable!;2005-11-21 21:04:00;5 to 10 seconds;White dot teleports in a triangular motion...unbelievable! It was a cold night in November 2005.  Around midnight me and two of my friends went to the liqour store to buy some alcohol. We came back to my house had a few drinks and then we went outside to smoke a couple ciggerettes in my backyard.  We put on some music and drank a bit more, suddenly i heard a loud pop or a snap as if something busted throught the Earth's atmosphere, it seems I was the only one of us three that heard the loud snapping sound. Anyways as soon as I heard the extremely loud snap I immediatley looked up towards the sound and there it was, a white dot quietly soaring throught the air.  After I looked at it my friends yelled out, Holy Shit! look!  while I was already looking, we all watched it for about 10 seconds and it disappeared.  The way it was moving was like not possible, it was literally teleporting in front of our eyes in a triangular motion then it disappeared.  We then argued about what we saw all night but no one else we knew saw it but us.  It was very eerie being the only one who heard the popping sound and looked immediately towards it. I should really carry a video camera around from now on...;49.8299567901234;-99.9631308641975
