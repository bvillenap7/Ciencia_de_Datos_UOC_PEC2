5 bright lights in skies over Southwestern Manitoba forming patterns at high rate of speed;2007-09-03 23:00:00;8 minutes;5 bright lights in skies over Southwestern Manitoba forming patterns at high rate of speed I was outside at night looking at the full moon through my binoculars and i noticed several lights in the sky, which were moving at a very fast speed. All of them were moving together in a fixed pattern and then they flew closer to one another and bunched into another pattern. I couldn't make out the shapes but they emitted bright white light. Almost looked like stars but weren't twinkling, of course. I witnessed this event for approxamately 7 to 8 minutes until they were out of my field of view past rooftops.;49.8299567901234;-99.9631308641975
