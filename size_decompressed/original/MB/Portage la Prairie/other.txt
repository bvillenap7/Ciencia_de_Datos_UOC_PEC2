Cloud cloaked large spacecraft/mothership moving across the sky in the morning;2016-03-28 07:40:00;15 minutes;Cloud cloaked large spacecraft/mothership moving across the sky in the morning I worked a typical Monday to Friday 8-4:30 job, about 20mins outside of town.  On this particular day, I saw this huge, out of place, cloud in the sky.  I then noticed there seemed to be a trail behind it, as if it moving across the sky and it was disrupting other clouds.  I also noted the area above the cloud appeared to be either sky or a bright light of some kind.   I had a Nikon coolpix camera that my work gave me for visiting jobsites, in my lunch bag.  So, I fished it out, and took a couple pictures of what I saw.   I then turned from a service road out onto the trans Canada highway eastbound.  I was now somewhat behind it.  I traveled at approx 110km/hr, until my next turn off and never made any ground on it.  In fact, it was outpacing me, and this was not a particularly windy day.  Until today, no one ever suggested I report it.  I'm taking the advice of a colleague I've recently aquantenced with, and reporting it now.  I do have 3 photos of what I saw in the sky, however I have no way to print them for mailing in. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));49.969;-98.2946
