Saw four orange balls in formation travel at high speed from south to north.;2014-05-24 01:10:00;10 seconds;Saw four orange balls in formation travel at high speed from south to north Early Saturday morning my grandson who is twelve and I went into the back yard of the house to see if the camaleparditis  meteorite showers had started.  It was a clear sky and we could see all the northern constilations.   At around 1:10 am as we were both looking south I could see four orange coloured, what I thought were fire balls that came from the south and passed overhead and headed to the north and dissapeared just above the horizon.  I would describe the orange lights as being in a chevron shaped formation but without the light at the front of it.  The lights appeared to travel in a formation as if they were  connected  together.  The lights were only visible for about ten seconds and traveled in a straight line as if it was following an orbit.  The lights did not leave a trail like a fire ball or meteorite does .   About ten minutes later a satellite  passed over following the same line.  The orange lights were much lower than the satellite.  The lights did not make any sound.   Both my grandson and first thought that they were part of the meteor showers, but I realized later that this was traveling in the wrong direction and did not look like a fire ball or meteorite.;49.969;-98.2946
