The sky was clear, but dark, as there was no moonlight.   I saw a bright object I believed to be a meteor flash down northwest of the highway.  It was very large and it flashed white.  I didn't think much of it until I came up behind a truck which appeared to be having light problems as the tail lights and headlight were flashing on and off.  My car was fine.   The truck turned off the highway and disappeared down a gravel road north.   Suddenly another flash of light from the south side of the highway caught my eye.  The light looked like it was coming from the ground and it resembled a rocket or firework.  It went too high in the sky to be a firework.   I thought it may be another meteor, but something seemed weird about the whole event.  The second light was also large, but it was green and red instead of white.   I have seen meteors and meteor showers, but I never have seen two that big or colourful.   I thought this was worth reporting.  It may be nothing, but two large meteors, but in conjunction with the car lights flashing on and off...kind of weird.;49.969;-98.2946
