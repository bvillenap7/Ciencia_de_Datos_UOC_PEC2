Doing sharp U turns, rapidly speeding up then slowing down. Noticed a strange bright light to the east in the middle of the night sky when taking dogs outside. It was pretty far away and had a pinkish red glow to it. Started watching it and noticed it was picking up speed rapidly then slowing down. Then it started to zig zag left and right. It was doing really sharp U turns, and travelling different distances between each U turn. Sometimes it would rapidly speed up immediately after a U turn. I could see a light trail when it would speed up. It was not moving uniformly or in any sort of pattern. Got girlfriend and she watched it for awhile too, but didn't think it was a big deal because she said she had seen it before.;49.5227;-96.4937
