I remember feeling so scared and helpless, trouble breathing, feeling of being abandoned.;1981-10-15 07:30:00;10 hours;I remember feeling so scared and helpless, trouble breathing, feeling of being abandoned. This report is from the year 1981.  I was 5 at the time and being driven to daycare by my mother.   Traveling down highway 7 at around 07:30, it was just getting light out but still dark.  The craft appeared all of a sudden and I asked my mom what is that, and she said she did not know.  Her recollection is different that mine after this time.  The craft, triangular in shape had lights on the bottom and the lights would flicker on and off but in a pattern, first one goes on then goes off, the next one in line would go off and so on.  The colour of the lights were different colours.  I remember we pulled over to the side of the road and my mom told me not to get out of the car but I did anyways.  I remember seeing other vehicles on the side of the road that day with people also observing and pointing at the craft.  My mother does not remember anyone there.  The next memory I have is running from the front yard of our house to the back yard and I was chasing so! me bright lights in the sky that were travelling just over our trees about 25-30 feet tall, at a slow speed maybe 10 KM/h.  The time is now about 9PM.  I remember being so scared I could not talk and when I tried, I had a hard time breathing when my mom came around the corner.  She did not see the craft which was also triangular in shape and the lights were bright yellow. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));50.1362;-97.321
