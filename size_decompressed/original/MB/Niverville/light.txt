Single white light wit no sound observed moving W to E which seemed to grow in brightness the farther away it moved from observer.;2017-08-07 21:30:00;2-3 minutes;Single white light wit no sound observed moving west to east which seemed to grow in brightness the farther away it moved from observer On the evening of August 7th, 2017, at approximately 9:30 pm, while out in my front yard, I was looking up, as we were expecting rain and I was checking to see if any rain clouds had moved in.  It was still clear with only a few wispy clouds scattered widely across the sky.   A,s I was looking up I noticed what at first appeared to be a star, about the brightness of Venus.  It was stationary in relation to the other stars, but, then began to move.  I knew it was moving as it closed the distance between itself and a stationary star in my field of view.  I'm familiar with aircraft, as I grew up on RCAF bases, and we are on the flight path of the airport in Winnipeg.   This light made no sound, had no other lights or beacons, and moved much slower than even a landing aircraft, and it was moving east in a straight line, not to the northwest, which would be the case if it was landing in Winnipeg.  I continued to watch it as it moved east gaining speed as it went, and the strange thing is it increased in brightness, the farther away from me it got,  almost as if it wanted to make sure I could follow its progress.  I remained visible until it disappeared over the horizon.   I'm 62 years old a truck driver and don't drink or use drugs;49.6064;-97.0395
