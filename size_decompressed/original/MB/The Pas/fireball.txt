very bright green ball of light;2002-08-20 01:05:00;2 seconds;very bright green ball of light I had just left work and was driving down the road traveling west when out of the corner of my eye I saw a bright green ball of light traveling south west. About five minutes later I was traveling south and I saw a bright flash of light similar to an explosion in the same direction the ball of light was traveling. The ball of light was as bright as a flare but travelled far to fast to be a flare.;53.7056;-101.2975
