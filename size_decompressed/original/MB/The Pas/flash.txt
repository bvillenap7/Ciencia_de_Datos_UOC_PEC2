Very bright huge circular form of light shooting upwards in the atmosphere in Manitoba, Canada.;2013-08-03 00:10:00;3 seconds.;Very bright huge circular form of light shooting upwards in the atmosphere in Manitoba, Canada. 	Last night at approximately 12:15 a.m (0:15), me and my friend were sitting outside gazing the stars and talking.  We seen a couple of those objects that are told to be satellites going by (appears as a star moving through the sky).  They then dimmed out and we continued to watch.  Right before our eyes, it appeared to be very close, definitely in our atmosphere a huge very bright object appeared and shot upwards very fast and then completely dimmed out.  This object appeared so close maybe a couple kilometres away and it was very low and shot very fast upwards and immediately dimmed out. It was huge and very bright a kind of circular form.  There was light radiating from it and it shot upwards so fast that it only lasted approximately 2-3 seconds and then immediately dimmed out. After that we continued to watch and only seen a couple of shooting stars.  Me and my friend are completely unaware of what it is we need to do now, we want to contact someone to inform ! them of this.;53.7056;-101.2975
