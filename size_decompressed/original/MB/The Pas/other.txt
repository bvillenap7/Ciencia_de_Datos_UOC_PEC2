T shaped upside down craft Brighter than Venus with pulsating smaller red light near rear In Manitoba.  ((NUFORC Note:  ISS??  PD));2007-06-02 01:36:00;2 minutes;T shaped upside down craft Brighter than Venus with pulsating smaller red light near rear In Manitoba My wife and I were on our front deck, smoking a cigarette, when a very bright star like light caught my eye in the southwest sky.   Was moving from southwest to northeast, in a slow but erratic movement, somewhat zigzagging, speeding and slowing, just erratic.   The object was starlike in light... brighter than venus, close enough to see that it was T shaped, except upside down, a small pulsating red light at rear of Bottom of craft.  No sound at all.   Moved across the sky from Horizon to Horizon.   Dimming as it neared Horizon but still visible.  Was definitely not a jet, nor a plane,  And i dont think satelites are close enough to visibly see shape, and smaller lights within the main light.  Qualifies as a UFO in my book.
