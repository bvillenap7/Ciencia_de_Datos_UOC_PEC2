Round ball with fuselage attached.;2008-10-23 14:00:00;90 secs;Round ball with fuselage attached. On October 23, 2008 at about 2pm, I was outside in the yard with two preschool children. Visibility was excellent and there were no clouds. I looked up and saw a UFO at the zenith. It appeared to be as high as a jet plane and was traveling rapidly in a westerly direction and stayed in sight for over a minute but not as long as two minutes. There was no vapor trail visible but there seemed to be some very faint black smoke behind it. The object looked like a round ball that was pure white, with a streamlined fuselage of some kind projecting from the ball in the direction of travel. This structure was dark in colour and about 1/8 the diameter of the ball. I thought the object was several miles up and about twice the diameter of a jet airplane. The object did not change course or appearance while visible. The children also saw it. I am unaware of any aircraft like this. The location was a farm near Hamiota, Manitoba.
