V shaped object seen near Pilot Mound Manitoba.;2006-05-11 06:38:00;2 min;V shaped object seen near Pilot Mound Manitoba. On this particular morning, I was out for my usual dusk walk.  I was walking around the outskirts of the city when I saw  what I believed to be a UFO. It was in a v shape with 9 yellow lights lining the sides.  I  could not judge the size for it was to far away. It looked to be about 2km above my location.  I observed the object banked to the North East.   I observed the object for 2 min until I couldnt see it any more. It was traviling fairly slow.
