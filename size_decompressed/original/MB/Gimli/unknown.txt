I was with about 8 people standing on the Gimli Beach.  I saw a large light coming from the horizon on my right.   The light was moving so fast the blinks were elongated.  This blinking occurred about 5-6 times between one horizon to the next in about 8 seconds.   I'm reporting this now because I have never heard any report of elongated blinks.  When I look at a plane at night it seems to be small and move much slower as it blinks.  This was like a much larger version of this moving so fast the blinks would stretch and then shrink.  It even went over a low thin cloud mass and I saw the blinking right through the clouds.  I asked if anyone else had seen that and one of the ladies said I did.  She nodded her head when I explained what I saw.   I later found out that many UFO sightings were being seen during that time of the year at that location.;50.6349;-97.0116
