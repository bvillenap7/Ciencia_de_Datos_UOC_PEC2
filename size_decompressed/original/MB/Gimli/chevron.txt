It was 12:15 am May 01/16 and my girlfriend and myself had gone outside for a cigarette before retiring for the evening, we were sitting on the front step of our house, it was a very clear night, and we were commenting on the sky and she says there is a plane and it is going very fast, I said planes don't look fast in the sky and thought maybe the spacestation or satellite and stood up and looked and saw 4 orange lights go directly over our heads, in the form of a check mark, the lights would have been the size of a quarter held at arm's length, and the lights almost seemed obscured by cloud, but it was a clear night, and there was absolutely NO sound. We both looked at each other in amazement and asked Did you see that !!?? We both acknowledged what we saw. We returned into the house and sat quietly for a few minutes , I then said we have to go back out , we out the back door and sat outside gazing at the sky. I should have mentioned the craft we saw at 0:15 was travelling south to north. Sitting in the back yard , gazing at the sky when I yelled Look , coming from the southwest going to the north , again right over head , 3 smaller lights , first appearing as light orange turning to a greenish white and quickly flying by , this was at 0:41, again , we were amazed at what we saw, sitting for a few more minutes , and coming from the exact same location as the previous 3 , 6 lights , moving quickly and dancing around as the went past. We sat for a few more minutes and my girlfriend was visibly shaken and we went into the house and tried to go to sleep , but it was a restless night to say the least.;50.6349;-97.0116
