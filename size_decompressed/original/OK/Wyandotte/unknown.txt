Twin bridges hoving just feet over the rivere right by the highway;2014-11-15 23:45:00;1 minute;twin bidges hoving just feet over the rivere right by the highway I was dropping my husband off at work he works a over night shift I left at 11:45 as I went across the east side bridge of twin bridges I noticed a group of bright lights approx. 4 to 6 lights hovering about a couple feet off the top of the water I thought must be fishermen on that island but as I continued driving further west I realized the river was up and that island was just trees growing up from the river bed there is no place for someone to set or stand to be fishing there so I thought maybe it was houses on the bank past the trees but the next night I when by again and there are only maybe 3 house light on the bank and they were orange  Not the bright white-ish color of the lights the night before and on the 2nd night the only lights I could see were the 3 or so house lights, the bright lights were not there and have not been there since this happened.
