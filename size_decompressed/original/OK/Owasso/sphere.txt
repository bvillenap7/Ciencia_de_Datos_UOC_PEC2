Amber glowing Sphere flys over Owasso, Oklahoma;2009-07-07 22:45:00;10 mins;Amber glowing Sphere flys over Owasso, Oklahoma I live near an airport so I am used to seeing planes. That is why this one stood out. Instead of the normal color of light, it was glowing a dark amber color. it was heading in a N NW direction.  I asked my room mate what she thought it was, she didn't know.  We continued to watch it, as it flew in our direction. It was very high up.  As it got closer, it just blinked out. I could still see it though.  Against the dark sky, the shape was very defined.  It was almost jellyfish like, in the way it was moving around as it flew forward. As I ran down the sidewalk, it was almost above my head.  I could see it very clear. It was very large, rotating in a circular motion, and continuing on its course. It the got directly above my head, and instantly changed it's course sharply to directly west. I continued to watch it, and finally lost sight of it when it flew beyond the path of some trees.;36.2862;-95.8227000000001
Shiny metallic orb object, Appeared for about 4 seconds, Got out of my car and it was gone.;2015-10-13 16:15:00;10 seconds;Shiny metallic orb object, Appeared for about 4 seconds, Got out of my car and it was gone. I was driving up my driveway from work when I noticed a shiny metallic orb, heading south of my neighbourhood.  I parked the car half way in the garage as fast as I could and went back outside to go look at the object again, and it was completely gone.  It was not the shape of an airplane, and if it had been a plane, there is no way it could have disappeared completely within 3-7 seconds.  I looked all around for it to make sure I hadn't just missed it, but it was gone.  I wish I had stopped to take a photo.  I will keep an eye out to see if it appears again.  I don't know if anyone else saw it, but I'm hoping they did.;36.2862;-95.8227000000001
