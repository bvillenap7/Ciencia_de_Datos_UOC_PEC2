Huge triangle shape steady red and white lights not moving and low to the ground appeared many city blocks in length and width;2008-01-16 05:07:00;4 min;Huge triangle shape steady red and white lights not moving and low to the ground appeared many city blocks in length and width Driving north on Highway 169 from Tulsa, OK to Coffeyville, KS a little after 5 in the morning.  Saw a huge triangle shaped object that did not look like it was moving at all due west of the highway.  I was driving with a co-worker and did not say a word about it.  It had many steady red and white lights which appeared to be on many different levels.  It also appeared to have triangular shaped tiers.  The outline was lit up by all of the red and white lights all over it.  We did not hear any sound from inside the car.  My co-worker finally blurted out loud that it does not look like it is moving.  And it is so huge.  I said I had seen it too however I had not wanted to say anything.  He leaned forward looking out the driver side window and continued to exclaim, it is not moving at all.  We did not stop as we were going to work and finally drove far enough north on the highway to leave it behind.  It seemed like it took 3 to 5 minutes to drive past as it was so big.  My passenger kept saying it couldn't have been an airplane it was way to low, to big, and did not appear to move at all the whole time as we drove by.;36.2862;-95.8227000000001

Triangular shaped aircraft hovering over apartment complex in Owasso, OK on 04/01/2020;2009-11-03 00:00:00;1 minute;Triangular shaped aircraft hovering over apartment complex in Owasso, OK on 04/01/2020 At approx 0510 on 04/01/2020, I was heading North on 97th E Ave in Owasso, OK.  On my left was a Casey’s convenient store and an apartment complex directly behind it.  Directly above the apartment complex was a triangular shaped aircraft with lights on each corner hovering over top.  The aircraft was hovering very low approx 50 feet above the complex.  I kept driving and decided to turn around with approx 30 seconds to take a picture or video of the aircraft.  I turned around in a residential development approx a quarter of a mile north of the apartment complex.  When I arrived at the apartments the aircraft disappeared.    I couldn’t see any sign of aircraft or the lights.  I then turned right on 86th street heading west. There is open land and thought that the aircraft may have landed there possibly but still there was no sign.  I tried filing a report that day on the City of Owasso website.  You are instructed to create an account and the will email you ver! ification.  I was never sent the verification email and therefor was unable to report the incident online.;36.2862;-95.8227000000001
Triangular shaped UFO passes over my house in broad daylight.;2011-07-09 10:35:00;3-4 minutes;Triangular shaped UFO passes over my house in broad daylight. On July 9, 2001 at 10:35 am, I was sitting on my back porch while talking with my mother (facing east) on my cell phone, I noticed an object in the sky. They sky was bright blue with some random clouds at very high altitude. Basically a bright sunny summer morning. The object was fairly obvious to notice in the sky because the sun created a shadow underneath the object giving it shape as I was looking up. I initially thought it to be a high flying bird or hawk approximately 250-300ft above the ground. But then I noticed that it had a consistant course of direction and was headed my way. It grew larger as it approached (object was heading due west at approximately 30-40mph). As it approached, it grew in size and became clear to me that this was not a bird or a normal/everyday aircraft as I heard no noise. Living within a few miles of the approach path for the largest airport near our city, and an avid military aircraft buff, I knew this was nothing I had ever seen before nor could I identify. My second impression was that a balloon was let go and drifting, but this object continued to maintain a westward course against a south/southeasterly wind at 10-15 mph and did not change altitude. As I started to mention this to my mother (while on the cell phone and the object now close to overhead and probably just two to three blocks north of my house) we lost cell reception, and our call was dropped. I have always had excellent if not perfect cell reception the 7 years i have lived in my town.  This was not normal cell reception as the closest cell tower is only a half mile away. The object was a very soft triangular shape (roughly the size of a compact car such as a mazda miata or something) and looked disk shpae from the side. So picture a very soft triangle from underneath the object, but was convex or disk shaped on the roof of it. It had a slow rotation to it the entire time, it maintained level flight, never made a sound, and did not roll or pitch in a fashion that a tirangular shaped ballon might tumble while moving along with the wind. It was silvery gray with some shimmer that the sun provided which informed me of the rotation it had. Then I thought, as weird as this was, I would try to snap some pics with my cell phone camera. I quickly took two pictures and I continued to watch the object continue it's course until it was completly out of my sight (heading due west). So I started in the back yard, facing east, and walked to the front yard, facing west, and watched it until my polarized sunglasses (which helped see the object for a much further distance) were of no use and the object was gone. I then was curious to see what my photos had produced. There was nothing in the sky that I could see on my pictures. I had some of the neighboring house tops in as references to possibly size and distance the object, but nothing of the object was visible. I was then a little un-nerved about this. A photo expert may be able to find something or I may have not gotten the object into view while taking them. I honestly cannot say, but I did make an honest effort to capture the object on two pictures. Either way I was extremely disappointed. I have never seen anything like it before. I feel fortunate to have seen something that I could not identify. Wow. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));36.2862;-95.8227000000001
White light triangular over central oklahoma  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus.  PD));2013-11-27 19:00:00;30 minutes;white light triangular over central oklahoma I looked up to the sky as i was driving to Tulsa Oklahoma and I saw a bright light in the sky at first I thought it was airplane but as I looked at it I could see a faint shadow of a triangular craft.  The light was one of the brightest lights I have ever seen. it also looked like there was dome shape on the top part of the craft. so I pulled over and began recording it.   The object would be bright then it would go dimmer then brighter again.  I know it wasn't a cellphone tower because I noticed the object was moving. it was moving very slowly but nevertheless it was moving. there was only one of them.  it seemed to be moving then it began to hover then moving again.  this was a big object though my guess would be about the length of 4 semi trucks. ((NUFORC Note:  We have corresponded with the witness, and agree that the object probably was Venus, seen prominently in the southwest sky.  PD));36.2862;-95.8227000000001
