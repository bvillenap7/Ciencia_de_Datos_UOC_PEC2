The object appeared to be a large star moving North, while the jets were moving South.   After the jets had passed, the object began to move in rapid zig-zag pattern, like it was bouncing.   It then stopped completely, while flashing slightly brighter, and appeared to blink out like a light bulb burning out creating a bright flash.  Dogs started barking all around the neighborhood.   We waited to see if there was anything else, for around 10 minutes, and there was nothing else that we saw.;34.1345;-97.4279
