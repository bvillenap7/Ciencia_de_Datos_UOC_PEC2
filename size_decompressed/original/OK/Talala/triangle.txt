A small black triangular object keeps pace with me.;2014-06-15 11:00:00;5 minutes;A small black triangular object keeps pace with me. I was driving from Talala to work in Oologah in the 1990’s and I can’t remember the exact date or year.  There are 6 miles between the 2 towns and it’s all country.  There are pastures with barbed wire fences and cattle and horses inside, the houses were mostly further back at that time.  There were vehicles behind me and in front of me all during this time.  I’m sure that the vehicles behind me must’ve have seen this thing.  They were pretty close to me. I noticed something out of the corner of my eye to my right and saw this small, black, triangular object riding alongside me just on the other side of my passenger window.  If I had been the passenger in my car, I am quite sure I could have reached my hand out of the window and touch it.  It was too small for a person to fit inside and it had a black dome thing underneath.  The edges of the triangle were curved and not sharp looking at all.  I didn’t see any lights, no noise, just this thing that appeared simply out of nowhere.  If I had to guess, I’d say it was most likely 4” deep, maybe 5’ in length. I was going the speed limit of 55 mph which I think was the legal limit at the time.  The object kept in pace with me.  While driving and keeping my eye on the road I kept watching it and it kept my speed.  Once I got into the more populated area, the thing sped up so fast it was out of my sight within 2 seconds!  Once I got to work my manager took a look at my face and she said, “You look like you just saw a ghost!” I told her what happened and she believed me.  One final note, this was the 3rd time I had seen this object.  The other 2 times were in the back roads of Talala: hovering over a tree and once hovering over a small pond.
