AT 7:30PM I SEEN WHAT I THOUGHT WAS AN EXTREMELY BRIGHT SATELITE MOVING FROM THE SOUTH WEST TOWARD THE NORTH EAST.  WHEN THIS OBJECT GOT DIRECTLY OVER HEAD IT TURNED A BRIGHT RED. THE OBJECT NEVER TURNED ,SLOWED DOWN,OR SPED UP.THEN THE OBJECT FADED TO A BURNT ORANGE COLOR AND SLOW FADED OUT AS IF IT WERE LEAVING.  IT DID NOT HAVE A TAIL LIKE IT MAY HAVE BEEN BURNING UP.  I AM QUIT SURE THAT IT WAS LEAVING NOT ARRIVING. AGAIN THE OBJECT NEVER TURNED SLOWED DOWN OR SPED UP.  IT JUST CHANGED COLORS AND FADED OUT.  ALSO THE SKY WAS CLEAR NOT ONE CLOUD.;36.1348;-96.1405
Colorful lights in the night sky.;2016-08-10 22:30:00;Unknown;Colorful lights in the night sky. I was standing on my front porch late at night and observed what I thought was a star.  I stood there and watched it for about 15 to 20 minutes and started to realize that this wasn't like any star I had ever seen.  I saw various colors of blue, red, yellow, and green flashes from this object. It would also move slowly from side to side.   After I went into the house, I sat down to watch some T.V.  About an hour later I took my dog outside and saw that the light had disappeared.  I am a firm believer in the paranormal and I do believe that we are not alone in this universe.  It is my honest opinion that what I saw was definitely unidentifiable and has made me watch the night skies even closer now.   I should note that I showed this object to my wife, and she too believes that what she saw was definitely not a star.   We both tried to use our phones to photograph the object, but it was too far away for our phones to pick up.;36.1348;-96.1405
Light Cluster west of Tulsa Suburd;2016-08-12 00:05:00;10-15 minutes;Light Cluster west of Tulsa Suburd My mother called me out to the back porch to sit with her.  She was observing a cluster of lights in the sky west of our home.  As we observed the lights the moved side ways then corrected back to a central position..it repeated this several times jogging left and right.  This occurred for 10 to 15 minutes.  I went inside to get a phone.  I returned and was told it was gone. The lights were in a cluster and changed through many colors. The lights were at approximately 40 to 55 degrees above the horizon. The sky was a bit cloudy but no clouds were observed in front of the lights.;36.1348;-96.1405

First object was slightly ahead of the next four which were then equally spaced.  No trail behind to suggest meteor or debris hitting the atmosphere.  Was not a successive line of dozens of objects to suggest the starlink satellite group.  Speed seemed to remain constant and viewed until out of sight.  Lasted about 1.5 mins from first observation.  Lights did not have a twinkle effect or blinking to suggest stars or aircraft.;36.1348;-96.1405
