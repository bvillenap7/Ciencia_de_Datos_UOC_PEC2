As she was doing her business, (I star gaze every night and am very aware of the stars/planes that are in my area) I noticed the skies were UNUSUALLY dark and couldn't make out a single star.  As I searched the sky for for any visible stars, I spotted an extremely bright light in the northeast, somewhat low in the horizon.  It seemed to change shapes (if that makes any sense) and blink erratically.  It was changing shape from a circle to a horizontal dumbbell-like shape and seemed to blink from yellow to a whitish like light.  At first I thought it was stationary, so I positioned myself near a tree so the branches would could be in the line of vision so I could gauge any movement. It seemed to slowly move to the east, and be at least a mile out, so I couldn't tell the size.  Then, after observing it for about 30 seconds, it just blinked out.  I walked to the backyard to see if I c! ould find it, but it was definitely gone.;36.1348;-96.1405
