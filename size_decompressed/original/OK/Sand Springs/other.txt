Line of 5 lights blinking in a pattern over Shell Lake, 30 minutes outside of Tulsa.;2009-03-24 21:40:00;5 minutes;Line of 5 lights blinking in a pattern over Shell Lake, 30 minutes outside of Tulsa. I was just coming home from my job at a grocery store and stopped at the top of my driveway to grab the newspaper before parking my car. When I got out of my vehicle I looked at the sky over the nearby lake, known as Shell Lake. My attention was immediately drawn to a sighting in the sky. I witnessed a line of five objects. The objects stretched across the sky above the lake. They stayed still in the same place for several minutes, and blinked a clear white light one after another from left to right in uniform fashion. I immediately called my girlfriend to let her know what I was witnessing, as I was pretty amazed at this, I have never seen anything like it before. I continued to watch these objects blink high in the sky as I talked to her. A car passed behind me on the road. Then, they suddenly stopped, all at once, and were gone.;36.1348;-96.1405
