I was standing outside on our back deck talking to my husband.  I was facing him and suddenly a bright light flashed in an upside down mushroom formation, in the sky and lit up a bright white round disk.  THe disc appeared to be flat.  Then the light seemed to suck back up into the sky in the same mushroom formation as it had appeared.  My husband did not see it.  I asked him if he saw something light up our house (behind me) or light up my face and he said no.  The disc appeared to be right above our trees in the back yard.   When I looked away into the dark, I had blue circles in my eyes, as though I had just been looking at a light bulb or something.  We live in the country.;36.1348;-96.1405
Orange glowing  round object seen in the sky just 2 miles of Lake Keystone, Sand Springs, Oklahoma;2011-01-04 00:30:00;45 seconds;Orange glowing  round object seen in the sky just 2 miles of Lake Keystone, Sand Springs, Oklahoma I live around 2 miles east of Keystone Lake.   At 00:30, my son and I observed a round glowing object just above my house off from highway 51.  It didn't make any sounds no red blue or white lights and appeared to hover in the same place.   I ran into the house to get my camera but when I returned it had already disappeared.  My son told me that it just stayed there in the same spot then it went straight up into the sky and disappeared.   I am a 49yr old registered nurse and my son is a 26yr old college student.;36.1348;-96.1405
