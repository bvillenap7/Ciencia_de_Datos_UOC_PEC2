Large, bright object in sky.   ((NUFORC Note:  Probably Venus.  PD));2015-04-12 21:00:00;15 minutes;large, bright object in sky. While walking my dog I observed a very intense, bright light in the Western sky.  It looked as if two stars had merged, one on top of the other.  Only the thing that caught my attention was that they weren’t twinkling like the other stars in the sky. Then I thought maybe it was a planet, but I noticed blinking that was happening around the circumference.  It appeared to have a mechanical blinking pattern.  So I grabbed my DSLR camera and began to film. The object didn’t physically move in the sky, but appeared to be getting dimmer as time went on.  It could not have been a helicopter because it was too high in the sky, and it never changed position. After about 15-20 minutes, the object completely faded away.  Was that a supernova?
