20+ huge red fireballs flying south to north near SandSprings,Oklahoma;2012-07-04 22:00:00;1 hour;20+ huge red fireballs flying south to north near SandSprings,Oklahoma We were all sitting outside watching fireworks and out of nowhere a huge bright red light not flashing was moving south to north wasn't sure what to think of it until a series of other bright red light were following it,  I stopped count after 24 not sure if they kept circling and coming back around or if there was actually more than what I saw but they kept coming over the same area.  A few were bobbing left to right and I personally have never seen or know of any aircraft that can move side to side as fast as these objects appeared to be performing.  Tonight I know from what I and 3 others had witnessed was something strange in the Oklahoma skies.;36.1348;-96.1405
