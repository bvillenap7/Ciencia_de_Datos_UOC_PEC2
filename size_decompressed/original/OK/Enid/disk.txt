Strange flying disk over Enid, Oklahoma near Vance AFB;2008-02-27 21:00:00;10 minutes;Strange flying disk over Enid, Oklahoma, near Vance AFB While going out for dinner on 21:00 February 27 2008, myself and several of my friends noticed what looked like a large airplane in the distance.  We looked once again and noticed a distinct disk like shape to the aircraft as it began to come closer and closer to our position.   The object seemed to have two red lights and blue lights on what I can only assume would be the sides of the craft.  I could not tell what color the object was due to the dark skies, but there was a slight humming or buzzing noise that accompanied its movement.   We continued to watch, what we now thought to be a UFO, fly over our heads and then without warning the craft left the area with amazing speed.   The whole incident has left me feeling confused and a little scared, when I found this site I knew I would be able to tell my story without the fear of others thinking I was crazy.;36.3951473684211;-97.899422368421
