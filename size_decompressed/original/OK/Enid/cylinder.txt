Glowing pulsating bumpy cylinder seen early a.m. In Oklahoma;2017-05-12 00:40:00;7-10 seconds;Glowing pulsating bumpy cylinder seen early a.m. In Oklahoma Visiting from Texas and staying in a hotel in Enid, Oklahoma.  I heard a pulsating hum outside my hotel window that woke me up.  As I awoke, I noticed a greenish glow from outside.   I got up and pulled open the curtains and saw what looked like a tube or a bumpy cylinder shaped lampshade.  It was moving slowly through the parking lot from my right to left.  I was upstairs, 3 rooms from the end, on the east side of the hotel and when it got to the corner of the building it turned left and went around the corner to the front of the hotel.   I grabbed my phone and went down the stairs and outside and ran to the corner to get a better look.  It was gone.  The object appeared to be about 3 feet long and a diameter of about a small lampshade, maybe about the size that a soccer ball could fit in the end of it.  It appeared to be solid but hollow in the middle.  The light was pusating from inside of the object and was luminating in a haze from the ends.   The object was smooth, but had a series of bumps raised on it that almost looked like tree bark.  The object was moving slowly but steady from my left to right, south to north.  It was directly in my eyeline on the second floor of my hotel, maybe 18 feet in the air.;36.3951473684211;-97.899422368421
