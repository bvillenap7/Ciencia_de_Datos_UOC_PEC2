i saw an unusually bright star;2001-11-26 01:00:00;~8 minutes;My wife and i let my dog out at 1.  I was looking at the stars like i always do when i let my dog out and i saw an unusually bright star outside way brighter then the rest of the stars.  it took me a second to realize it was moving i pointed to my wife and it took her a second to realize it was moving too then it did i u turn unlike any airplane i have seen it has no red warning lights flashing.  Then it stopped just sat there in the sky floating there.  we weren't inside to get our roommate and our phone after we went outside it was gone,;36.3951473684211;-97.899422368421
Fast moving ball of light speeds across the sky.;2006-10-11 22:00:00;about 1 minute;Fast moving ball of light speeds across the sky. I was standing in my front yard finishing my smoke when I looked up at the aky as I usually do, its gorgeous!  Anyways, I saw a bright light moving East.  I've seen these lights before sitting with ,y parents in the back yard and we were all amazed at its speed but this one was different because it stayed in straight.  The others we saw would sort of wander around in the sky.  As soon as it seemed pretty much directly overhead, it got really bright. At least 3 or 4 times its original brightness, then it dulled back out and continued its path. It never stopped or slowed down. It just faded off into thew distance, I figured after seeing so many I should try to figure out what they are.  The whole thing took about one to one and a half minutes.  Not long. And it was only slightly bigger than a start so it was moving very fast to cover that much distance in that amount of time. Probably not a plane cuz it didn't flah, but Vance Air Force Base is right across the highway so i cant be sure.  I dont know what they have in the airways. It just didnt seem like a plane could be that high or get that bright.  Also, I heard what sounded like a jet very far off in the distance as it passed and for a short time after, but like i said, we got Vance right here, could have been night training.;36.3951473684211;-97.899422368421
