Large, circular red object flying very slowly at high altitude overhead travelling SSW to NNE.;2012-07-04 22:30:00;15-20 minutes;Large, circular red object flying very slowly at high altitude overhead travelling SSW to NNE. During a 4th of July fireworks display, a large, circular red object was observed flying very slowly (almost as if it were a hot-air balloon) travelling SSW to NNE.  Only, the object was very high in the sky & much too high to be a hot-air balloon.  Also, it was night so it is doubtful that it could have been a hot-air balloon. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Hello Peter,    The circular, red object was approximately comparable in size to that of a full moon...maybe just a bit larger.   I hope that helps!
