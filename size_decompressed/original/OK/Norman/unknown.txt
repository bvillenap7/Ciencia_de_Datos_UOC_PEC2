It never fell. While me and some co-workers were waiting in front of the building that we clock in for work, one of the women of our group exclaimed, Hey! That looks like something is on fire in the sky. At first we laughed until we looked up toward the north of us and saw what looked to be a large object glowing flying through the sky with a steady red tail of flame. It appeared to be traveling from the west and slowly turning toward the southeast. At that time of the morning there were no planes in the air and very little lights around the campus. There was no doubt that it was not a lighting illusion or an airplane. This kept a steady distance from the ground all the while we witnessed it. I ran further into the parking lot to keep it in sight until it was covered from sight by trees. I have no doubt in my mind that it was still at the same altitude even as it disappeared over the horizon. If it had been a plane in that much trouble we would have seen it go down way before it went out of our sight.;35.2194486187845;-97.4257878453039
I saw a light blue UFO with a low sound emitted that seemed to abduct a dog, and then vanish.;2008-10-15 20:42:00;About 2-3 minutes;I saw a light blue UFO with a low sound emitted that seemed to abduct a dog, and then vanish. I walked into the hall tonight to hear from the open window a low, small sound. It was as if a plane were overhead, but it was so peculiar - so unlike any plane I'd ever heard - I had to step outside. My dogs were going crazy trying to get out the back screen door, scratching and barking. I let them out and walked a few steps under my gazebo, confused, and then I saw it, partly obscured by the top of the structure. It was bright blue and flashing lights of some sort. I wasn't sure if there were more than one - I saw it for an instant. There may have been an abduction - another dog barking in the background stopped suddenly after a flash of light. Then suddenly as I stepped out to get a better view, it lingered for an instant and suddenly vanished as if by magic. The noise, however, did not stop.;35.2194486187845;-97.4257878453039
An oval light appeared over the moon, shined a beam of light over Lake Thunderbird, and then streaked off.;2012-01-29 23:30:00;5-10 seconds;An oval light appeared over the moon, shined a beam of light over Lake Thunderbird, and then streaked off. I was at Lake Thunderbird on the outskirts of Norman recording some sound for a video piece I was working on.  At around 11:30 pm I saw a light that was nearly in the direct center of the moon from where I was looking at it.  The light was oval shaped and every so often a smaller flash of light would blink around it.  After only a second or two a beam extended down from the oval shape and shined on the water below.  It rested for maybe another second and then streaked off too fast for the eye to follow.  I remember feeling nauseated by the fact that I was there alone.  I got in my car and left immediately.

A blinking light which changed intensity, and had a non-recurring pattern, moving in a non-uniform direction, then streaked across sky;2012-09-01 17:45:00;30 seconds;A blinking light which changed intensity, and had a non-recurring pattern, moving in a non-uniform direction, then streaked across sky Time: approximately 9:45 pm Date:  Sept 1st, 2012 Location:  Norman, OK Visibility:  Unlimited, perfectly clear night  While standing outside on my back porch looking up at the stars, a blink of a light in my field of vision caught my attention.   I couldnâ€™t immediately see the source of the light because the frequency of the blinking was not regular.  Two to three seconds passed and then it blinked again.  The object had moved above 6-8 inches (measured from my extended arm).  The intensity and size of the light was about equal to the average star.  A few seconds later it blinked again, moving about the same distance, and in a straight line moving towards the North East.  This time the intensity of the light was greater, about equal to the light of Venus, which also gave the impression that it was larger or moving downward.  A few more seconds passed and the light blinked again, much fainter (fainter than the first blink), and the object had moved in a Northern direction (up from its previous direction), and the distance was about 2-3 inches (measured from my extended arm).  I followed that! trajectory, anticipating the next blink.  As I scanned the area about 5 seconds later, I saw a faint streak of light moving from the last location of the object (approximately) and moving in an Easterly direction (slightly south of east).  I scanned the sky for several more minutes but saw nothing else.  The length of the entire incident was approximately 30 seconds.  And the object was located approximately 65 - 75 degrees above the horizon, as I was looking toward the North.  There was no sound.  There were no obstructions in my field of vision.  And it was a perfectly clear evening, and visibility was excellent.  I had the impression that the object was very far away.  The blinking of the light changed in intensity, and its blinking was an irregular pattern.;35.2194486187845;-97.4257878453039
