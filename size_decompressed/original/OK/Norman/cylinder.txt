Long string of white lights.   ((Starlink satellites?));2020-10-24 20:00:00;30 seconds;Long string of white lights. While outside my niece said “what’s that?” And pointed up. When we looked up there was a straight row of small lights. We knew it wasn’t an ordinary air craft because none of the lights were blinking. The only way I can describe it is like a straight row of Christmas lights on a string. Some of the lights were white, some were blue, and some of them were green. You could kind of make out a shape behind the lights that looked like a blimp shape. There were no clouds in the sky so it was strange when the object looked like it disappeared into nothing. They are saying it is a satellite on Facebook but still want to report.;35.2194486187845;-97.4257878453039
