Bright, spherical, white light seen over apartment complex.;2002-08-02 23:10:00;2 seconds;Bright, spherical, white light seen over apartment complex. While star gazing in my apartment's courtyard, I observed a bright, white, spherical light. It moved rapidly across the sky from behind some of the apartment buildings into a clearing and then behind more apartment buildings. The object was moving from east to west and I lost sight of it due north. The object's distance was hard to gauge, but it seemed to be closer than a commercial airliner at cruising altitude. It was about the size of a nickel held at arm's length, and appeared at about 30 degrees from the horizon. The whole event only lasted about 2 seconds and no noise was emitted from the object.;35.2194486187845;-97.4257878453039
Small, faintly triangular light seen over east Norman, OK;2011-11-16 19:00:00;<5 seconds;Small, faintly triangular light seen over east Norman, OK At approx. 0100 UTC, I sighted a small triangular light streaking overhead at estimated altitude of 10000 feet above MSL, accurate to within 5000 feet.  I had heard a helicopter in the distance and dogs in the yard barking about 30 seconds prior and stepped outside to observe.  The helicopter was fairly low, about 500 feet or less AGL.  It appeared to be on the same heading as the object and appeared to be in pursuit.  I spend a good portion of my time observing and studying aircraft, and what I saw was quite obviously no aircraft.  It was completely silent and appeared to be traveling at 800+ knots.  It, along with the helicopter appeared to be on a heading of about 180 magnetic.  I believe that this was a UFO because of the incredible speed and the lack of navigation lights or sound that would accompany an aircraft.;35.2194486187845;-97.4257878453039

They would've passed for stars if stationary.  Most were fairly close together with four or five stragglers.  The lights did not blink and there was no sound.

Bright circular light in western sky in Oklahoma multiplied into total 13 lights then into single light and suddenly dissapeared 5 min;2017-05-03 01:00:00;5 minutes;Bright circular light in western sky in Oklahoma multiplied into total 13 lights, then into single light and suddenly disappeared.  Visible for 5 minutes.   In western sky looking outside my window at about 30 degree angle from horizon, I first saw a very bright solid light intermittently through light moving clouds that was not moving.  About one minute into observation, first a smaller circular bright light shot from main larger circular bright light to immediate left at fast rate downward zigzagging sharp angles, then instantly disappear. Then almost immediately, 12 smaller circular bright lights zoomed at high rate of speed from the larger bright white circular light at same fast speed outward in straight directions equally spaced around the center light in an octagonal like shape. All lights remained same luminous and did not move for about 4 minutes. At about 5 minutes after initial sighting, the 12 smaller lights circled around the larger light at high rate of uniform speed returned to the larger light at same precise moment. Within few seconds the now original bright larger light without moving instantly disappeared.;35.2194486187845;-97.4257878453039
