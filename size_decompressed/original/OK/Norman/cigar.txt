My wife and I were having dinner on the patio, when something bright in the sky caught my eye.  The object was bright (possibly from sun reflection) and produced one brilliant (sun?) flash as it approached 90 degrees overhead.  The object appeared a little wider than my thumb at arms lemgth.  I thought it resembled two 737 fuselages my wife describes it as two silver frankfurters.   We live 15 miles S. and 14 miles E. of the closest commercial airport(OKC), and 15 miles S. and 5 miles east of Tinker AFB.  We see many aircraft on approach to these two airports as well as light aircraft at low altitudes and are familiar with these. This object was about the size of a commercial airliner on approach to OKC.  However it had no wings or tail fins, and it didn't taper towards the tail like an airliner does.  It was shaped like a short cigar.  There was no vapor trail and no sound.   We live in a quiet place and there was absolutely no sound.  My wife saw me look up and she saw it without me having to call her attention to it.  We both sat dumbfounded as it sped along overhead.  Afterwards, we agreed that it was the most unusual thing we had ever seen! I cannot estimate well the speed or distance, but were I to guess, I would say if the object were the size of a 737 fuselage, it would have been 2 miles high and half a mile East of us. It was moving about twice the speed of an airliner on approach to OKC.   The course was directly from the South to the North (airliners on approach are usually East to West).   As it was about to go out of sight into the trees, I ran and fetched a pair of 10X50 binoculars.  I caught sight of it again through the branches, and it appeared to be two metallic cylinders with a space between them about half as wide as they were thick.;35.2194486187845;-97.4257878453039
Cigar shaped craft hovering over Norman, Oklahoma.;2013-07-09 14:53:00;10-15 seconds;Cigar shaped craft hovering over Norman, Oklahoma I was driving home from work from Oklahoma City, from I-35, whenever I happened fo look up and see a cigar shaped, aluminum/reflective colored aircraft (no wings, lights, or other normal qualities) going northwest.   It was not very high off the ground... easily below an altitude of 1000 feet. I was able to stare at it for about 10 seconds before it finally disapeared from sight, behind a line of trees that i was driving by.  Sadly, I wasn't able to pull my phone's recorder up in time to capture any video of it... Despite it being in the middle of the day!  Would have been great.;35.2194486187845;-97.4257878453039
