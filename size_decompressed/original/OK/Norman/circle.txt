Orange and Red light above Norman Oklahoma.;2009-05-30 21:40:00;Roughly 10 minutes;Orange and Red light above Norman Oklahoma. At approximately 21:40 hours my security officer while on patrol witnessed an orange and red ball of light.   According to the security officer he ball of light appeared small, like a star, however it also seemed to be a few hundred feet above the tree line.  He watched the light zig-zag, and move and stop in a manner that seems unlikely or improbable for a plane or helicopter.  His job duties prevented him from staying in the area and observing the object further. It should be noted that there is a small airfield approximately 15 miles to the north of his location. Despite this he was positive that the light in no way resembled any craft he's aware of.;35.2194486187845;-97.4257878453039
