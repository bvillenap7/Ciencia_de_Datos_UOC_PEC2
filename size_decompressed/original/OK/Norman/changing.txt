I was closing a window in my home that looks toward the south and I saw a redish-orange light that was flying to the north.  It appeared almost like fire burning in the sky and when I called my wife into the room to view the object, she at first thought it might be a helicopter on fire.  We watched as the object continued north for approximately 1 minute and it then made a turn to the west and traveled that direction for approximately another minute.  About 30 seconds into its flight toward the west, it changed from orange to white and afterward, the light dimmed-out.  The object was flying at low altitude we are guessing at possibly at 3 or 4 thousand feet and we are certain that it was not an airplane or helicopter.  The color and brightness of the light was unlike what one would see from an airplane.  We also wondered about the possibility of a hot air passenger or weather baloon but with it maintaining the constant light and changing directions, we knew this would rule out this type of object.  Its flight seemed deliberate but its appearance was very unusual because it appeared to change shape as if its light was slightly dimming and then becoming brighter at times, as it was flying.;35.2194486187845;-97.4257878453039
