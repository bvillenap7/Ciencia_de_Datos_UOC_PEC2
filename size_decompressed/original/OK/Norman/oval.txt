Yellowish center middle orange with a outter red glow sphere;2011-10-13 01:36:00;2 min;Yellowish center middle orange with a outter red glow sphere On October the 16th, 2011, at 01:36, I got up from my computer and when out back to smoke a cigarette.  The back of my house points to the north.  I turned to my east (right) to look at the stars like I usually do, and saw a fast moving object come into view.  It came in like a meteorite, but slowed down to the speeds of a helicopter at about 145-165 mph.  It kept horizontal from south to north.   From where I was the object was a quarter of  the size of the moon (5x time bigger than the north star). It was yellow in the center to orange with a outer glow of red.  The object was about 1000-1500 ft in altitude and was about half mile to mile out.  The object was about 60 degrees from my location.  I realized that what I saw was something that I have not seen before.  I knew that this was not normal.   I went to the back door to call my wife outside to come and look at it.  She got up fast and came to the back yard with me.  As I turned back to show her the object it had moved roughly 10+ miles to the north in the time frame of 7 to 8 sec. and disappeared. I was in the Marine Corps for 6 years, and was Medically Retired.  I worked on CH-46 as a Hydraulics/airframe (MOS6152).  I also got time to work on CH-53, and Cobras.   As I served I was also a volunteer firefighter for 3 years.  I was stationed in New River,  NC. very close to Cherry Point Marine airbase.  While in I have seen my fair share of aircraft.  I know that what i saw was nothing like what I have ever seen before. The weather outside was Temperature 61째F / 16째C,  Dew point 45째F / 7째C, Humidity 55%,  Pressure 30.06 in(1018 mb), Winds NE 8.1 mph (NE 13 kph), Precip none,  Visibility 10SM.;35.2194486187845;-97.4257878453039
