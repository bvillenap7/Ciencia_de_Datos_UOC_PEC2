a string of lights that went on for miles in the West sky,((NUFORC Note:  Cluster of Starlink satellites.  PD));2019-11-12 18:29:00;2 minutes;a string of lights that went on for miles in the West sky, one brighter in front and two at the end. At 6:29 PM, I walked out of my workplace while on the phone, locked the door and started heading to my vehicle.  I noticed in the sky a very long line of individual lights, one brighter in the front and two brighter in the back of the line.  It looked like it stretched for miles, then the lights just disappeared.  The formation was to the West of me, and the lights were moving South-Southwest.  On the way home I called my wife to tell her I saw a UFO, and she had seen something similar and described it to me before I told her about my experience.;35.2194486187845;-97.4257878453039
