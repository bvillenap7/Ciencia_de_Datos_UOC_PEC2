Huge, orange ball with black streaks of various shapes and sizes on surface.;2003-01-11 01:27:00;1 min or less;Huge, orange ball with black streaks of various shapes and sizes on surface. Out in my backyard.  Saw a huge semi-circle with vague light above it in a flatter formation.   The sphere was bright orange with black tendrils of various shapes on surface. I thought it might be the moon, but it was too low.  Found the moon much higher and it was white, quarter moon.  This was definitely round, though it looked as if the sphere had been cut off at the top, like an upside down dome.  Ran inside and got my video camera and followed it the whole way down into the tree tops.  Looked like it sat on the tree tops for a while.  Went in to call my sister, a pilot, and it was gone when I came back out.  Checked my camera, but I must have forgotten to push record.  Dumb of me!!
