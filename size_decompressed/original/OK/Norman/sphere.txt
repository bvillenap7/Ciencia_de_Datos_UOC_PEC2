My friend and I and her two daughters were in the parking lot of her apartment complex in Norman, OK.   I was suddenly compelled to look up in the sky, along with my friend ((deleted--mother)) and her older daughter, ((name deleted)).   The three of us saw the object, which we all believe we only saw half of it.  It was spherical in shape with extensions surrounding it.   It appeared to be coming out of a cloud, but the night was clear.  It appeared to be like a floating shadow.  There was no noise coming from it.   Within a matter of seconds, it disappeared. ((deleted--daughter)), who was nine at the time, described it as a floating dragon, and later drew a picture of the floating object.   The only possible explanation is that it was some type of test plane from nearby Tinker AFB in Midwest City, OK.  It was not shaped in any manner like a plane that I am familiar with.   There were no other aircraft in the vicinity when we saw the object.;35.2194486187845;-97.4257878453039
Silver Sphere sighted, Flew off!  A USAF Jet circled the area in search of the object.;1996-06-11 17:30:00;7 min;Silver Sphere sighted, Flew off!  A USAF Jet circled the area in search of the object. I was relaxing in my parents spa.  About ten minutes had past and I got a strange feeling that I was being watched.  I opened my eyes and stared up into the sky.  I noticed a silver greyish ball in the sky just hovering, approx 2 football fields high. I thought it was the damnest thing.  Being a person with a rational mind I ran inside and told my wife, and mother to come see. I realized that a multiple sighting would have more weight than a single eye witness account. They rushed outside and I had them look in the area of the object.  I was actually suprised it was still there 3 min must have passed since I first saw it.  I thought it could be a weather balloon My mother has poor eyesight and can not see even with the help of her glasses.  My wife could not see it until it emitted a orange glow from underneath that lasted about 1.5 sec.  That helped her focus in on the object.  Shortly after it emitted a blue orange glow underneath and went up out of the atmosphere. Out of site. No sound was heard during the whole event and it was quite windy.  The object never diviated from it's local position, was not affected by the wind.  At that point I desided it wasn't a weather balloon I continued to scan the sky about 1 minute after the object left the atmosphere a military jet flew into the area where the object was and circled as if searching for something then it left. Usually jets don't fly in our area that low.  I then called the local MUFON group and and told them what I saw.  They blew me off. I was 24 years of age at the time and personally didn't believe in UFO's at that time.  Several days after the incident I had seen some strange lights in the sky, green shooting comets on a horizontal plane with the earth. I am a member of the US Reserves.  My reasons for reporting this is to have a documented report of this incident, I feel it is worth mentioning.;35.2194486187845;-97.4257878453039
White dot of light moved at right angles, stopped, then sped off sooo fast, no sonic boom;1997-08-01 04:00:00;4 minutes;White dot of light moved at right angles, stopped, then sped off sooo fast, no sonic boom In the Fall of 1997 I was on a camping/fishing trip with friends.  There was limited space inside the camper so I opted to sleep in my truck bed on a cot.  Around 4am I was staring at the sky (satellite watching) and saw a dot of light larger than what I was expecting to see.  Thought it might be the space station but then I thought it was way to big for that even.  The dot of light was moving slow and steady in single direction in what I thought was space and when it approached cloudcover I thought it would be gone behind the clouds.  It kept going “under” the clouds.  This startled me as I realized it was not in space but below clouds.  It then stopped.  Just stopped. For about 20 seconds then began moving again at a right angle to the previous direction.  (the original direction was left to right across sky. After stopping and starting again it was going down)  Suddenly, it took off in an entirely different direction at such a high speed it could have been a shooting star.  It was gone.  There was no noise, no sonic boom which I would of suspected at that rate of speed.  NOTE: I was not intoxicated and I am actually a non-drinker to this day. I am not a ufo believer. I think that all things like this can somehow be a natural occurrence.  I don’t believe there are little green men blah blah.  That is why I never reported this sighting.  However, with the new information popping up on the news about these tic tac ufo’s I thought maybe I should report it as the movement and speed seem so similar to the tic tacs.  It was to far to tell if the shape was round or oval but the movement was incredible and bizarre.  No blinking lights, just steady light (like a satellite looks with the naked eye)  Sighting occurred at Thunderbird Lake (state park) near Norman Oklahoma.  Background of the observer:  24 yr old woman, 3 yrs of college education, career was graphic design,;35.2194486187845;-97.4257878453039
A luminous whilte sphere flying slowly,  Winked out of sight abruptly and did not reappear.;1998-11-10 10:05:00;3 minutes;A luminous whilte sphere flying slowly,  Winked out of sight abruptly and did not reappear. There was one white sphere which appeared lit from within.  It was very distinct and had no haze.  It was high in the sky, somewhere south of the I-35/ Robinson exit.   It slowly moved to lower altitude, heading west.  About three minutes after I first spotted it, it simply disappeared.   It may have been that the object was still there, but the light went off, making it hard to see againt the sky, which was pale blue.;35.2194486187845;-97.4257878453039
Seen 4 yellow balls of light lower than airplanes usually fly coming very fast from Northwest to Southwest. They looked to be the size ;1999-12-23 17:20:00;40 seconds;Seen 4 yellow balls of light lower than airplanes usually fly coming very fast from Northwest to Southwest.  They looked to be the size of a small house each.  Disappeared near but not to the horizon.  Disappeared in a flash of bright white light. My daughter and son along with two friends of my son were in the back yard of ours playing ball, etc., when they spotted yellow glowing balls of light heading at a tremendous speed about 45 degrees from the horizon from the Northwest to the southwest.   Several times it looked according to them that the objects stopped or rather jerked almost to a complete stop then continued at the same fast pace.  As they reached near the horizon, still in a tight formation of two by two they disappeared in a brilliant flash of white light.;35.2194486187845;-97.4257878453039
A bright soundless orb of light hovering about 200 feet in the air which went east into norman.;2012-10-17 19:00:00;5 minutes;a bright soundless orb of light hovering about 200 feet in the air which went east into norman. Me and a friend both sound and mind.. we’re chilling At the Duck pond bridge.. We both noticed a light which first looked like a star… get closer and it seemed as if it was like… 150 yards away or so.. it look  as if it was hovering about 200 feet off the ground at the end of the park by the rail road tracks.. it was a very VERY bright light.  After hovering for about 3 to 5 minutes it lifting up higher in the air and it went east and the light got smaller.. and then it stopped and hovered for about a minute and continued going east until it was out of sight and we could not see the light anymore.. and soon as it went away a odd looking man walked by us about 15 feet away.. he was walking sort of oddly.. I’m not saying he was an alien.  He did not react to the light in any way.  Even though it was clearly in his sight.. Well I just wanted to share this with you all.. keep a eye out around 9pm-midnight.. over the duck pond and around the train tracks..;35.2194486187845;-97.4257878453039

Bright white orb with no sound.;2020-10-11 18:00:00;30 seconds;Bright white orb with no sound. My friend and I were outside smoking on a clear sunny Sunday evening when we noticed a bright light moving in the sky roughly 1000-2000 ft above. Very bright white orb moving steady along with no sound. Friend mentioned he herd nothing and the the light was 3 notches of brightness below the sun. The ball of light kept moving until out of view. Could clearly see the circumference of the orb and the light was extra bright from the very center with small rays emitting outward incased by the orb. Also, there were other air craft in the area at cursing altitude and a few private planes entering and leaving the local airport.;35.2194486187845;-97.4257878453039
