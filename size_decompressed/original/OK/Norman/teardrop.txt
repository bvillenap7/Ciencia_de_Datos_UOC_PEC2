Yellow and green, larger teardrop shaped object above southeast Norman.;2016-10-27 22:40:00;5 seconds;Yellow and green, larger teardrop shaped object above southeast Norman. Observed the object while stopping at the intersection of highway 77 and cedar lane. It seemed to have been above Highway 9 and 24th Avenue, towards the east, possibly farther north.   It was much larger than a shooting star, teardrop shaped, glowing bright yellow with green around the edges.  It seemed to have appeared in the middle of the sky suddenly, then fell towards the ground.   I lost sight of it behind the trees and the neighborhood.  There was just one. I always assumed that there is intelligent life outside of our solar system, but I have never witnessed a UFO.;35.2194486187845;-97.4257878453039
