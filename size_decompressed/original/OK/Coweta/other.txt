Green object seen in the sky at night.;2005-11-02 20:30:00;15 seconds;Green object seen in the sky at night. 1 green object was seen in the sky.  It appeared just near two radio towers that were flashing.  It was a different green, comparable to faded neon, or moss.  The green object was rather large, approximately 1/5 the size of the moon.  It was almost in an asterisk shape (*), and was falling as if a shooting star or a meteor.  Just a bit aways from the towers, it disappeared completely.   I kept my eyes upon the sky for another 15 minutes, but nothing else.   I said Coweta in Oklahoma, but it was more of the highway (highway 51) between Coweta and Wagoner, heading west.
