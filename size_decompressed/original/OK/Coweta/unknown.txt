I was using the quick shot more on m camera phone because they were flying over so fast. I never realized there was anything in the sky other than the birds until I went inside to sit down and look at te pictures I was able to get.  And that when I noticed it.. When I went back out to look it was gone.  And it only apeared in 1 pictire out of 10.99th;35.9558;-95.65
