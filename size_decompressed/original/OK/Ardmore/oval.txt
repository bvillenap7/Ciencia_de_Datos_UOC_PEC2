Polished oval shaped craft with green illumination moving in a controlled manner;2009-08-11 00:30:00;5 seconds;Polished oval shaped craft with green illumination moving in a controlled manner my sister and i were sitting in the drive way in the car and out of nowhere a ufo appeared and zoomed off in a controlled and fast manner.  It was a very thin oval shape (less pointy than a football but more pointy than an oval) craft that had green illumination around it.  I couldn't see the bottom because of the green light around the middle but it was very smooth and polished on top kind of a metal or beige color on top.   It was nothing either of us have ever seen and it was moving very controlled and in a slight descent angle. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

two machines one silver and one red/oranges oval ufo there no clouds like the sky opened and they went in.;2011-10-21 12:00:00;8 minutes;two machines one silver and one red/oranges oval ufo there no clouds like the sky opened and they went in. I saw a military plane circling around the apartment area and than what I saw next was beyond my own understanding I saw a bright silver cylinder looking object I thought at first a satellite, but than it moved slowly about 1/3 from its stating point and than about 7 minutes later and severely circling of the plane I was stunned to see a second UFO come from behind the silver object it moved back and it was bigger some how and than the second machine went from backing up a little and than it moved forward about 1 to 2 miles and it just disappeared and it had no nose it was a bright red/orange oval three dim it moved in a straight line and than it just disappeared it was big and the bottom of this thing had a shadow it just disappeared by the way I forgot to mention there was no cloud in the skies and it took about 30 seconds to disappear and when i looked back at the silver object it was gone it took 10 minutes from start to finish. This is not a joke at all! and i need answer it was weird and I need answer.;34.1602;-97.1814000000001
