Bright red/white light changing directions rapidly and descending and ascending rapidly.;2015-11-17 03:00:00;~5 minutes;Bright red/white light changing directions rapidly and descending and ascending rapidly. While I was working security in Oklahoma, watching a storm coming in around 3 am on 11/17/2015.  I was facing west, when I noticed a bright red/white light, like an orb.  At first I thought it was a radio tower light but I noticed it was moving.  The bright light looked like a radio tower light you would see off in the distance while driving.  The bright light was moving south half way above tree line and the clouds.  The light then suddenly started going back north for a little distance the suddenly headed back south. It traveled a little more distance and stopped and hovered.   All of a sudden the light dropped down towards the ground, at a pace a little slower than dropping a ball, disappearing behind the tree line.  After a few second 10 to 20 seconds the light came straight back up at the same pace and place, it descended.  It came to a rest and hovered at the same place it fell from.  The bright light then started to move south again for a short distance until it sto! pped and hovered and fell again.  After the same amount of time, approx. 10 to 20 seconds, it came back up to same spot, it stopped, and hovered.   The bright light then moved to the south again where it did the same thing only this time it didn't come back up watched for 5 to 10 mins never seeing the light again.  The bright red/white light was several miles off like looking at a radio tower hazard light at the top.   It was dark and storming with mild to strong wind and rain so the light stood out very well. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he seemed to us to be quite sober-minded.  We suspect that he is a very good witness.  PD));34.1602;-97.1814000000001
