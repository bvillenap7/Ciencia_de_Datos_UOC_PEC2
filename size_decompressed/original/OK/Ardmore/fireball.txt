Orange/Yellow flying ball;2012-07-19 23:00:00;1 minute;Orange/Yellow flying ball On the 19th of July 2012 @ 11 pm I was looking south at what looks like a normal satellite. Then right in my vision like right now is a large yellowish/orangeish ball looking thing. The ball started up in the sky and sort of arced down while flying north.  It was coming in my general direction (so it headed S to N)   At first I thought it was a very very low flying plane but it didn’t sound like a plane, there was no sound and had no flashing lights.  It was a solid orange/yellow ball. If I had to guess at its size, I’d say the size of a large tractor inner tube.;34.1602;-97.1814000000001
