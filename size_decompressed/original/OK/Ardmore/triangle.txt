Triangular craft with three red lights hovering and then circling areas in Ardmore, Oklahoma.;2011-08-31 00:00:00;2 minutes;Triangular craft with three red lights hovering and then circling areas in Ardmore, Oklahoma. I walked outside for a moment to sit on my back porch, and thought to see a normal red light similar to that of a helicopter.  It was coming from the east and heading west.  It started heading south and then turned back to head east.  It stopped and hovered over my porch.  It was lower than a normal airplane and made less noise than an airplane would.  It did not make the same sound as a helicopter. When it stayed above my head, higher than my house, but lower than a normal airplane for a moment, I noticed that the one bright light was three.  It was shaped like a triangle.   I ran inside briefly to grab my son and husband.  We came out side and watched it hover for a moment and head back southwest.  It went towards the main city, but moved back southeast.  It circled an area before it became out of sight.;34.1602;-97.1814000000001
