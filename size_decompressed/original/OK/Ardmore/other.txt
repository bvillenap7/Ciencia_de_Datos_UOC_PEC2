When I looked up, I saw a tall black figure with no eyes looking at me. The figure was almost as tall as the house I was near. The creature looked at me for about five seconds while I was locked in place. The creature seemed to force me to stay, then it let me go. It did nothing at all, yet it was intimidating.;34.1602;-97.1814000000001
