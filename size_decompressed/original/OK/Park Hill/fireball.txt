Other objects as well later saw a circular object in sky Me and my boyfriend we're going to our lake house one night last summer and we were pulling in to the area that we live and you can go right to the lake or left to our house and looking right to the lake there's like a couple balls of fire in the air except they're coming out of nowhere and they're slowly just going in a line formation and then they all sat there about eight of them and we drove down to where we could get a clear view and once we got there they were gone, later that night tho I looked up and saw this above us , all night. A couple weeks later I saw another ufo type and I have photographs of the 2nd and 3rd encounter.;35.7961;-94.9793
