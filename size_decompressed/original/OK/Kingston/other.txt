flying object, low, no sound, missile like yellow orange with a trail;2005-11-05 22:50:00;2 seconds;flying object, low, no sound, missile like yellow orange with a trail The sky was very clear and black.  Stars were bright as well.   We noticed 3 falling stars.  One before the event and 2 after the event.   Coming from the southeast heading to the northwest.  Heard no noise, but a train was passing about 7 miles away.  A large lake is the the south/southeast of us so sound travels very well.   The object reminded me of a falling star, but orange/yellow in color and about 20 times larger.  Also it was going in the opposite direction of a falling star.  It had somewhat of a trail or tail following behind.  This whole episode only lasted in our eyesight only a few seconds do to trees, barns, awnings.   Waited and watched for about 1 1/2 hours to see if another one came by, but nothing but the 2 falling stars that were more of a white color.  I would describe it as missile like.
