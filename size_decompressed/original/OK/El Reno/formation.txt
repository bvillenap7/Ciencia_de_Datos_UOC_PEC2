One large cigar-shaped craft surrounded by hundreds of smammer crafts all with long trails.;2001-12-01 22:30:00;5 minutes;One large cigar-shaped craft surrounded by hundreds of smammer crafts all with long trails. What appeared to be two aircraft approached from the southeast sky. As it neared, the masses veered to the north more and we saw what appeared to be one large cigar-shaped unit with lights throughtout and red at the back end. This extremely large unit was completely surrounded by hundreds of small units. They all had very long white trails. It was almost like watching hundreds of meteors in slow motion. We watched them until they went out of sight. They were traveling at about the same speed as a plane.
