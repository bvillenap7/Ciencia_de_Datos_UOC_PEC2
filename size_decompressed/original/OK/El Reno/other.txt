Strange Sights into the night!;2002-04-17 23:45:00;55 min;Strange Sights into the night! Myself and a few friends where traveling down Hwy 81 going to have some fun at the LuckyStar Casino. On our way there We noticed Strange lights flashing above we just thought it was Spot lights from the Casino. Until the Lights started moving in a stange motion. And Landed in a near by area in some farm land! We where all trying to come to terms with what we have just seen we thought maybe it was a crop duster or maybe a copter doing it runs (Practice flying at night). We pulled over down a dirt road to see. The Shape of the object is what threw us off until we got closer and we new for sure that was no crop duster or Copter! The Air Craft had changing lights and strobes this went on for about 30 mins maybe we started to hear this really load humming sound into a loud squall We new for sure this wasnt anything we had seen before the air craft had gotten louder it started to lift up slow into the sky the lights started shinning into the sky like it was tryin to send a message 2 more air craft showed up after a few mins of the flashing lights! the formed into a pattern and took off into the nights sky!   I dont know what happend that night were it had been Planes , Copters or UFO! but rest asure it will be something we will never for get.;35.5376;-97.9638
