Viewing Saturn, very bright, and Jupiter at 180° and 200°, at 50° and 30° respectfully.  Jupiter looked as if red and green lights were rotating around it left to right.  Get binocular for better viewing. Notice moving red and green light in same sky 160° at 30°.  Object flashing and moving west, rapidly!  Followed it going west at apparent same altitude.  Suddenly stopping and again moving west.  Moved west of Jupiter to approximately 220°, same elevation.  At this point it did a triangular move, going north, east and back west.  Move back and forth, then advanced NW heading 300° rapidly and disappeared into western sky.  With binocular on object it was difficult to track its movement, plus at times it was erratic.  Shorty after sighting but eye glass on flight at high altitude heading 300• to 120°.  Was able to distinguish large jet aircraft.  No sound from aircraft or unidentified object.  Heck, I'll go!;35.5376;-97.9638
