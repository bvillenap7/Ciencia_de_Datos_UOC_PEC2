COLOR CHANGING STROBE LIGHT OVER EL RENO, OK;2007-12-22 05:00:00;30 MIN;COLOR CHANGING STROBE LIGHT OVER EL RENO, OK I GOT UP TO TAKE OUT THE DOG AND IT WAS STILL DARK. SOMETIMES YOU SEE THINGS YOU CANNOT EXPLAIN AND YOUR MOUTH DROPS, I COULD NOT STOP STARING AT IT.  I TOOK SOME PICTURES WITH MY DIGITAL CAMERA. THEY ARE NOT GREAT PICTURES BECAUSE MY HAND WAS SHAKING.  AT FIRSM AN AIRPLANE WAS CIRCLING IT THEN THE PLANE SEEMED TO LEAVE AND NOT COME BACK.  IT WAS VERY FAR AWAY. IT SEEMED TO CHANGE ALL DIFFERENT COLORS RED YELLOW THEN FADING TO GREEN.  I SEEMED TO HOVER WITHOUT MUCH MOVEMENT AND I WATCHED IT FOR 30 MINUTES AND HAD TO JUST WALK AWAY, SCRATCHING MY HEAD.  UNIDENTIFIED? DEFINATELY. MY HUSBAND CAME OUT AND TOOK A PEAK. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));35.5376;-97.9638
