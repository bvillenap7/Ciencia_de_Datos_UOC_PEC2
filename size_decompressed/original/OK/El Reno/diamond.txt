White diamond shape' (s) over El Reno, Oklahoma;2008-07-03 16:00:00;30 SECONDS;White diamond shape' (s) over El Reno, Oklahoma I was traveling East on I-40 through El Reno, Oklahoma, about 4:00 PM.7-3-08. Off to the left about 2 miles to the North I saw either a diamond shaped white structure or 3 smaller structures traveling Northwest at a high rate of speed. This lasted about 30 seconds, and then it (they) just disappeared right in front of my eyes.;35.5376;-97.9638
