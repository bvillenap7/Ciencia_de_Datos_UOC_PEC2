((anonymous report));2017-05-18 00:00:00;All night;Last night, I saw a bunch of crafts flying over head, with different flashing lights.  It started up high and multiple different crafts, most with the same shape but different flashing lights.  Most with red and white flashing and not flashing with different patterns of blink.  They were flying in all directions.   I saw about 4 or 5 fly low and heading to the same location.  They looked like some kind of Lego built craft with lots of lights.
