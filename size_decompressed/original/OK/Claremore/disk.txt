Gray flying object over rural Oklahoma.;2014-05-21 23:10:00;10 seconds;Gray flying object over rural Oklahoma. No one will believe what I saw.  I've tried to go over all the possibilities ranging from ball lightning to a satellite.  I don't know who else to contact.  It frightened me to the point of crying.   This thing.... this unexplainable thing that just occurred will be scarred into my mind.  The object was circular and moved liked nothing I've ever seen.   It didn't move like a plane of any sort.  The speed was inexplicably fast.  It was gray.   I shouted at my friend but the duration was so short he missed it.  He doesn't believe me.  I don't even believe me.;36.3104208333333;-95.5994375000001
