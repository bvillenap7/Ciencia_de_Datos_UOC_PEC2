Large Fireball appears from nowhere in Rogers County Oklahoma.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor?  Any other witnesses?  PD));2008-05-11 23:00:00;5-10 seconds;Large Fireball appears from nowhere in Rogers County, Oklahoma After reading a posted report, I had to report my sighting.   It is obvious that my sighting is the same as another poster.   On May 11, 2008 at approximately 11:00 PM, I was sitting in my hot tub.  It was a clear night with bright moon light.  I had only been in the hot tub for 2-3 minutes.   I was sitting there looking into the sky and all of the sudden, a fireball came from nowhere.  It seemed to be only 300 to 400 feet above me and to the south of me about 200 feet.  It actually scared the heck out of me as it made a loud noise almost like a huge firecracker but much bigger and louder.   The fireball was very large with some sort of tail and it was traveling in a west/northwest direction.   As fast as it appeared, it disappeared.  I was in disbelief as I sat there wondering what I had just witnessed.   I turned the jets off, and I fully expected to see or hear something crash to the ground, but never did hear or see anything more of this object.   I would be curious to know exactly where the Tulsa poster was when they saw this object.   I called the local sheriffs office the next morning and of course they had no reports.   I thought I was crazy until I saw the Tulsa report which sounds to me like the same object I saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor?  Any other witnesses?  PD));36.3104208333333;-95.5994375000001
