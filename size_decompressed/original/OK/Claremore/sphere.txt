Nothing on this earth moves that fast!;1998-06-20 14:00:00;15sec.;Nothing on this earth moves that fast! On a partly cloudy afternoon I was working outside at industry plant along with 5 co-workers. While we were walking towards the blding. for a break I caught a movement faceing south starting at aprox. 80 Degrees moving at a high rate of speed towards the northeast to aprox.30 degrees off the northeast horizon. This object was sphere shaped and about the size of a pickup truck. Its elevation was about 1500 ft. lower than most cub piper aircraft cruising elevations.What really shocked me is that it stopped instantly and hovered. Suddenly it shot back south-southeast to a point almost directly overhead. This was aprox. 160 degrees back from its original course and at a high rate of speed. Again it stopped instantly and hovered. The sun light reflected off its surface showing that it was silver or metalic. I was in awe about what I was seeing and at the point of telling my co-workers Hey! Whats that in the sky when this object shot out of site over the north-northeast horizon. I then asked my co-workers hey did you see that, after a discription they all laugh saying I was seeing things. I don`t know what I saw that afternoon but I do know that it was not any weather balloon or airplane. I`m now just starting to talk about this and have only told a selected few friends and relatives about my experience. I`m a amateur astronomer and have 20-20 vision. Nothing in my 40 yrs. of life ever moved so fast outside of  shooting stars! ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));36.3104208333333;-95.5994375000001
