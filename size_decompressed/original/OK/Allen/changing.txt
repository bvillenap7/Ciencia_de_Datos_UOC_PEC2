There were 2 types of sightings.  The first 3 were all seen more to the southern portion of the sky and then travelled east at about 3-4 times the speed of an aircraft. There was an aircraft in the sjy around the same time. There were no flashing lights and the light was steady, no twinkling.  One made a 90 degree maneuver at one point.  They eventually diminished in size and dissapeared.  The next 4 appeared anywhere from 5 to 45 minutes apart and they all had the same similar location of origin but they would at first appear very large before diminishing to nothing.  Compared to the Large Red star in the southern sky (Mars? - Planet??) that was visible that night it would have been almost twice as large.  They moved very fast and dissapeared from sight in almost 10-15 seconds.  They were not comets or meteors or stars.  We were not convinced they were ships but they were definitely unusual.  The light appeared smooth in the sky as opposed to a plane when moving (slight jerky or halted motion??).;34.8676;-96.4111
