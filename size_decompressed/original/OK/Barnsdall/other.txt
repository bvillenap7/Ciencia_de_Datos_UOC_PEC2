Probably summer 1980;1980-06-15 00:00:00;2-3 sec;football shaped white object  traveling south to north east of Barnsdall, Ok .  Probably summer 1980 This happened twenty years ago, I was only eight years old, but the image is burned into my memory. I was awakened by the sound of cats fighting I stood up on my bed to look out the window and found the source of the noise across the street under the streetlight at the corner.  After watching them for a minute or so I noticed a bright white footbal shaped object to the right of my view. The window faced east so it was traveling roughly south to north and coming down at about a thirty degree angle until it dissappeared behind a really big tree and house. As far as I remember it was about the size of a nickel or smaller held at arms length and took just a few seconds to cross the view I had before being obscured by the trees and houses. I kept watching for several moments but did not see anything else.  I questioned what I actually saw for a really long time, believing it was a meteor or some kind of debris, but this was a solid white light, almost bright as the full moon but with no glare and very defined edges.  There was no trail left behind or any change in brightness or color and was definitely football shaped or eliptical with pointed ends.  I think my sister saw it also but I'm not sure if she did or remembers, she is 18 months younger than me and we shared the room with at the time. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
