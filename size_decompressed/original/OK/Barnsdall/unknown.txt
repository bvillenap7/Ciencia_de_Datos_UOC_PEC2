I had stopped on CR 2400 next to the cemetery and had exited my vehicle to retrieve newspapers from my trunk.   Looking back to the East, I observed a black object pass in front of the pleiades constellation moving north at a speed close to which commerical jets fly.   The object was large, although I could not make out a shape or approximate distance.   I heard no noise, nor observed any lights just a dark black craft or mass pass across the constellation and continue north until I could no longer make it out.;36.5441;-96.13
