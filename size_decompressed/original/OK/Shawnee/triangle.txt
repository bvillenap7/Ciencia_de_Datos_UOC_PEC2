As she rounded the corner of the garage to see what it was, she yelled for me to come out. She said it was hovering close to the ground and rose up to above the trees when I got out there.  There was a black triangle shaped craft as big as house with lights on each corner that was moving above the trees and It slowly traveled westward and up into the clouds.   It was an overcast night with low clouds with a glow of the city lights.  We both seen it was no helicopter and was clearly a black triangle with lights  on the corners.;35.3498865671642;-96.9435776119404
