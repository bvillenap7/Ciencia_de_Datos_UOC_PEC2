So, to start off my friend and I were walking down park st. on the way to Loves convienience store. We had stopped in the street. The way my friend describes it was he got a feeling or an urge if you will, to look up. Thats when he saw the ufo directly above us. He describes it as circular in shape with three lights on the underside. When he looked up the ufo shone a light on us through some trees that hung over the road. The light was bright but not painfull even though my eyes were adjusted to the darkness of the night. The light was light blue in color and reminded me of the color of lightning. The craft hovered there for a second and without discontinuing the light flew in an easterly direction, it moved faster than anything i've seen before, it flew horizontally and then shot straight up. The flight pattern i saw resembled a graphing of a number that is rising exponentially.   PS. sorry for the spelling errors i am on a phone with no spell check, also there was complete silence during this encounter.;35.3498865671642;-96.9435776119404
UFO spotted several times over past week.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a twinkling star, possibly Sirius.  PD));2016-10-22 03:30:00;3 hours;UFO spotted several times over past week My family and I have been seeing a reoccurring UFO for the past week.  We've seen it on three different occasions now between the hours of 2-5 AM.  The first time we saw it was on Sat, Oct. 22, 2016 at approximately 3:30 am.  Then we saw it a second time a couple nights later and once again a third night, Oct. 27, 2016, at 2:30 AM.  The object is a circular shape and has multi-colored lights on it.  The lights do not blink, but are solid. It moves erratically and quickly.  Very quick.  We actually witnessed two on the third night and they seemed to meet and one of them disappeared.  There was also at one point what seemed to be a tiny red light circling the UFO.  The object also seems to disappear as it ascends higher into the sky, yet it comes back down.  I live on the south side of Shawnee, right down the street from Firelake Grocery.  The object appears to be Southeast of Shawnee, more towards Seminole.  It seems to stay there for hours and there's also no sound.  The quality's not that great, but here's a link to some footage I took.  Best I could do.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAvW4FLC10w&t=301s ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a twinkling star, possibly Sirius.
