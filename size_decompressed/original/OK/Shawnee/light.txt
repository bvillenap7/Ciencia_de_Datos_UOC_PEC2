Orange light moving accross sky that turned bright white and vanished in Shawnee, OK 5/15/2009;2009-05-15 22:00:00;15 sec;Orange light moving accross sky that turned bright white and vanished in Shawnee, OK 5/15/2009 Around 10 pm on May 15th my husband (27 y/o Landscaper from Shawnee) and I (20 y/o Real Estate Agent also from Shawnee) were driving West on Clearpond Road at the intersection of Coker. It was cloudy and there was lightning because there was a storm moving in. I noticed an orange glow that at first I thought was just a plane, so I ignored it. But it appeared to be flying very low and towards us so it grabbed my attention again and I stopped. I had only really looked at it for about 10 seconds or so when the light turned bright white and started blinking, slowly at first and then more rapidly. It did that for just a few seconds more and then vanished. My husband was there with me and said it was probably just a plane that flew into the clouds. I believe differently.;35.3498865671642;-96.9435776119404
Distant intermittent erratic bright white object dancing around in Northern Star sky region after dark freaky!;2013-08-28 22:00:00;1 hour;Distant intermittent erratic bright white object dancing around in Northern Star sky region after dark freaky! I live dead in the Center of Oklahoma.  Sitting out in the cool North lawn after dark. First time 8/26/13 what appeared to be a distant star getting bright and dimming in the region of the North Star.  Object began getting bright, but not moving.  I was thinking I was witnessing a star exploding millions of years ago and light was just now getting here.   Then the object began to move about, like really erratic, like a star doing donuts in the sky.  It seemed to be outside our atmosphere.  I was mesmerised with it until it went out a few seconds later.   In a couple minutes, it appeared again but a few degrees away from original position.  It would move in a reletive straight line toward the East, then change directions suddenly.  It wasn't really headed anywhere, so it had no trajectory like a plane or satellite.  I see business jets and satelites passing over quite frequently.  This object just moved in erratic manner.   The Second time 8/28/13 I seen it, was really freaky, because it showed up two nights later, doing the same things, in the same sky region.   I again last seen it travel East toward Arkansas.  These episodes are within a :30 min. time range. Surely someone else sits in their North lawn after dark and sees this.
