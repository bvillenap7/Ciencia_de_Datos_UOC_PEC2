Chrome like, Winged object silently flew over.  ((anonymous report));2018-07-04 00:00:00;1 minute;Chrome like, Winged object silently flew over. After fireworks ended for the night, my brother, sister and I were sitting out by the pool on lounge chairs.  In the distance I noticed a weird disturbance in the air about 200 ft off the ground, and coming in our direction.  It was either really shiny.. like the chrome bean in Chicago, or it was see through.  It made almost no noise, just a whooshing sound as it went over very slowly.  I never said anything to my brother and sister, until it was over us..  We all were silent and watching it go over us.  It proceeded to move from west to east at a deliberate speed until it disappeared.;35.3498865671642;-96.9435776119404
