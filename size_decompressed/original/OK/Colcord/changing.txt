strange lights in Oklahoma sky outside Siloam Springs Arkansas March 25, 2010;2010-03-25 18:00:00;2 minutes;strange lights in Oklahoma sky outside Siloam Springs Arkansas March 25, 2010 My husband and I were leaving town on highway 412 in Oklahoma outside Siloam Springs Arkansas the night of March 25, 2010, headed east towards home when we noticed the lights hovering.  We had seen some lights like this once before in this same area but this time I grabbed my camera.  I couldn't seem to get the craft to show up in my view screen on my small digital camera.  I asked my husband to pull over and he did get some better shots.  In the video you can stop on frames 1:16, 1:18, 1:27, 1:28 and 1:39 to see the shapes of the crafts.  We don't know what they are but they did not act like any type of airplane or helicopter we had ever seen.;36.2298;-94.654
