Three UFO's Witnessed by four people.;2011-07-19 22:30:00;3 minutes;Three UFO's Witnessed by four people. my wife and i observed a craft lifting to the south east what appeared to be several miles away.  At first we thought it to be a helicopter but as it got closer we noticed it made no sound and did not have blinking lights.  It looked like a ball of fire.  We then noticed another craft lifting from the same direction as the first.  At this time I stepped into the house and called my son and his girlfriend outside.  They both ran out to witnessed the third craft taking off all followed the first craft on a flight path southeast to northwest.  We watched for approxamitly three minutes until they dissapeared.  They were moving slowly at first and gained speed rapidly vanishing out of sight.  Not one of us heard any sound coming from the craft.  Have pictures and vidio taken with my I phone.;36.0055;-96.1095999999999
