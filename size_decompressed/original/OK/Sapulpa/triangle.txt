Triangular object flying west;1989-11-14 20:00:00;3 ninutes;Triangular object flying west I know it was in November of 1989, around 8:00 pm.  I’m not sure of the exact date, but do know it would have been a Monday or Tuesday. I was driving west on Taft Street when I noticed a lot of people in the local Wal-Mart parking lot (132 west Taft St.) looking up and pointing toward the sky. I looked up and say a Dark triangular object hovering in the sky. It had 3 red lights on the tips. The lights were not flashing. After watching it for a moment a strange haze (bluish gray) emitted from what I assume to be the back of the object (facing the East side). The object then began moving west at a decent rate of speed. Then It emitted a bright reddish orange light and started moving incredibly fast (seemed to be moving higher too) Then 2 or 3 helicopters flew over the area, then 4 or 5 jets flew past the helicopters chasing the object. I lost sight of the object, then the jets, and finally the helicopters were no longer in site. A local radio station was broadcasting information for a brief while about the object, then no more mention of it. The next day there was no information in the paper or on the local news about it. The radio station denied any broadcasting info about any flying objects the previous night. I know what I say, and I know that I’m not the only one who saw this object, but I have never found any more documentation on it. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));36.0055;-96.1095999999999

The're were 2 ships.  They were a greyish blackish color with lights around them.  The lights flashed like in a chaser mode.  It made a light humming noise like a back masager.  I saw this flating over the local grocery store at about 22:35.  They just floated there for about 5 minutes the shot off like a rocket.  Nothing that I saw came out of or went into the craft but could definently tell it was not an airplane. ((NUFORC Note:  We presume the witness means to write a date of May 18, 2001.  We have amended the date here.  PD));36.0055;-96.1095999999999
