Last night  at approximately 10:30p.m. central time a friend and I were outside and saw a formation of at least 14 ufos flying across the sky in formation.  They were flying pretty low, but there was no sound heard from them.  Each one appeared to be a bright light followed by a bright fiery orange tail.  It took them a minute or less to fly out of sight never breaking formation. They were flying over Sapulpa, OK and towards Tulsa.
