Massive craft with 4 large lights ,masked in fog, moving over Sapulpa, OK.;2013-12-22 21:30:00;<1 minute;Massive craft with 4 large lights, masked in fog, moving over Sapulpa, OK. I was driving into Sapulpa from Tulsa on Sunday evening, 12/22/13.   I was going about 60mph on New Sapulpa Road when I noticed 4 huge, round, white lights moving in the opposite direction overhead.  The formation of these lights was a slightly convex curve/horizontal line.  It seemed to be one large craft.   The lights looked blurred as if they were masked in a fog.  They were moving at a steady pace, not too fast, not really slow.  I couldn't keep my eyes on it for long since I was driving.   No one else was around that I remember.  Not a busy road at night.   I need to stress that the round lights were VERY large, too large to have been an airplane.  They looked massive.   There was no sound.;36.0055;-96.1095999999999
