crafts over Sapulpa Oklahoma;2007-12-02 01:00:00;3 or more hours;crafts over Sapulpa Oklahoma I first noticed this strange light in the sky about Nov.2007 and ever night I go out and see if it is there not every night but I have seen this same light about 3 time and on 12-02-2007 I seen it again. It was around 11:30pm because my son just got home from work and he too seen the lights. The craft was round and had red, green,The object would remain still and then move side to side and begin to vibrate very rapidly. Sometimes it would just stop vibrating.Sometimes it would move in a linear fashion when vibrating and we watched for a while and then my son went to bed. I live in a 2 story house I went to my room and watched for a bit longer and around 1:30am I seen a craft fly by my bedroom window I know that it was not a plane because you could not hear it and it was way to low maybe about 200 ft;36.0055;-96.1095999999999
