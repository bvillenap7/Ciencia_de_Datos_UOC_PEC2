First spotted a light as I was traveling west on HWY 412 near Cleveland, OK.  As I was driving, I noticed a very bright light that looked to be possibly falling and on fire.   I continued to drive west until I was even with it from the highway.  I pulled over and rolled down the window to get a better look.   By this time, the bright light had dimmed.  The object was alone and hovering.  Sitting completely still and showing some red, green, and white lights.  The lights moved in a pattern across the back side of the object.   Less than a minute went by and the object started moving away from me.  I turned around and started driving east after the object before I had traveled 5 miles, the object was out of sight.  Teardrop in shape.  Very bright lights at a distant.;36.2563;-96.4222
