the sphere that was chased by a fighter jet  in the morning sky;2009-07-15 05:00:00;2 hours;the sphere that was chased by a fighter jet  in the morning sky Early in the morning I was walking out to my shop at about 5 am I looked up in the eastern sky and seen a sphere shaped object hovering in the sky that didn't appear to be as high up as most commercial aircraft that fly in my area. I decided at that time to go get my camcorder and record what I was seeing to be able to show my friends. I shot footage off and on for about 2 hours until it was light outside witch made it hard to see, then all the sudden I heard a roar in the sky to the south, as I looked That direction I seen what apeared to be a fighter jet with the afterburners on heading straight At it. It looked like the sphere started moveing north away from it as the fighter got close to it It went straight up over the top of the fighter jet and then apeared to back the other direction,  The fighter tryed to turn at that moment but couldn't turn that sharp and over shot the ufo so far  Because of the speed by the time it came back around the ufo was gone it just shot straght up in Sky until it was out of sight.  I did my best to zoom in and out on the ufo to get objects in the Footage to give some way to judge distance like trees and telephone poles I would like to show this Video along with a few others I have showed to friends that are very amazed at shots I have. I would just like someone that has the ability to examine the footage I have and tell me if its A ufo or if there is a normal explanation for what I seen.
