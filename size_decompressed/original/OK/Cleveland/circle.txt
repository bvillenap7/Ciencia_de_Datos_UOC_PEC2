UFO.;2014-08-18 22:00:00;4 minutes;UFO My friends and I were outside when we noticed what looked like a star heading north at a stationary speed.  It wasn't blinking, it just looked like a star.   Then it turned right and sped up a ways, and right from it another circular dot flew from it in the opposite direction.  Then right after it occurred and they disappeared I saw another small dot that grew brighter, than faded until it couldn't be seen.   Right after all the occurrences I noticed a few helicopters heading towards the general area in the sky...  Anyone know what this was?? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.
