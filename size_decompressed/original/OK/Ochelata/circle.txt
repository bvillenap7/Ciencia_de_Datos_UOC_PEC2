I was driving home from work like I always do and something caught my eye and I looked over and there was this circle shape with tons of blinking lights just hovering over a field.  It did not move nor was it very loud.  It spooked me that I was only able to video for 13 secs then I drove off as fast as I could. It was a dark road and I was the only car.  But I was able to get video of it.   The color of the lights were like a bluish tint.  The video I have makes it look like I was far away but I was not.  I was right there,this is not the first time I have seen something like it either, I have pictures of the others.;36.5938;-95.9656
