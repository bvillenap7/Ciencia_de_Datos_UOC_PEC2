Orange Ribbon of light in the night sky.;2021-05-28 22:10:00;3 minutes;Orange Ribbon of light in the night sky. Bright Orange horizontal light beam that appeared to wave and shimmer in the moonlight. Appeared to come out of the blackness of the night sky like a ribbon fluttering while moving very slowly. It seemed to vanish slowly after a few minutes as the ribbon got shorter and disappeared into the blackness on the opposite side it had come from. Best comparison is it looked like a comet moving in slow motion.;36.2882;-97.2854
