The circle objects seemed to disapear as fast as they apeared!!!!!!!!!!!;2003-09-22 21:00:00;about 15 minutes;The circle objects seemed to disapear as fast as they apeared!!!!!!!!!!! We saw about 12 different lights come and go they seemed to diapear rapidly as they came however they seemed to turn to the right as they left.We were on the old 112 highway moving toward cameron when my partner saw the first sighting we tried to get to where it was but as we aproached an airplane came near the objects of interest and they seemed to quit as fast as they started no explanation to what they were if they were meteor showers how could they have just quit when the plane aproached?Well i leave this for you guys to ponder!!!!!!!!!;35.1462;-94.5079
