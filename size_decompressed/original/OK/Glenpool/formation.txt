There was three distinctive lights horizontally in the sky.  At first I thought that they must be stars doing what they do best, even though it was very light outside.  I then decided that these pulsating lights were much to bright to be stars when all of a sudden the one on the far right spit out a orange/peach colored light that hastily went off to the south. After watching that happen I went inside telling myself that I was nuts.  I don't know how long the lights stayed around for, because frankly putting it,  It scared me!  I don't ufo hunt/watch or whatever and have never been on this website before.  I just wanted to mention this because aircraft don't do that, and as far as I know neither do stars!;35.9599;-95.9935
