Something was outside my home that was not human or animal.  ((anonymous report));2019-01-14 23:40:00;1 minute;Something was outside my home that was not human or animal Heard very strange noises similar to a frog but much louder and higher pitched across the street and a few houses away.  It got closer very quickly, faster than someone could run.  It sounded like more than 1 and was in my backyard all of a sudden.  My cat started freaking out so I knew something was outside.  I felt like I was being watched and I'm not one to get spooked.  There is no possible way to get into my backyard.
