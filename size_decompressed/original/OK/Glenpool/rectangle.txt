Several different colored lights in the sky.;2014-01-16 19:00:00;1-2 minutes;Several diffrent colored lights in the sky. I was driving to a local store, when I saw straight in front of me several lights that where like glitter falling in the sky.  Then they all seem to stop the glittery effect and change to a very bright white light, they stayed that way for several seconds, then changed again.  Some where a pulsing red light, somewhere pulsing green light, and some where a less bright white pulsing light. They all took off in different drections some faster then others.  I got to see one with a green light to the right of me pretty close and it seemed to be a triangular shape.   As I keep driving they seem to have turned all lights off instead of flying off out of sight.;35.9599;-95.9935
