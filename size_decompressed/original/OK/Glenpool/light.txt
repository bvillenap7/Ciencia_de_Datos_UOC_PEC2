Orange-Red lights/circles seen in SW sky near Glenpool;2014-08-18 22:46:00;15 minutes;Orange-Red lights/circles seen in SW sky near Glenpool While driving home from work down peoria near 161st I spotted 3 lights in the sky to the south west. One was flashing, two were a consistant orange-red color that seemed to pulse ever so slighty.   I immidiately reached my home and woke up my father, who did see the lights as well.  The flashing light soon approached, going along the normal air traffic path as so many other airplanes have in this area, with the tell-tale flashings of white and red, the shape of its wings clearly seen.   There is an airport to the south west and they tend to travel in the general direction of the Tulsa airport, but the other two lights, which were not flashing, only slighty pulsing to where one could almost not notice, the other two stayed for a bit, then slighty went to the east, then faded away. The lights could be compared to a mix of the light that is given off by Venus and/or Mars, but both were not only in the wrong spot according to my google sky they also clearly moved, and then quickly disapeared into the night.;35.9599;-95.9935
Four bright lights moving in formation south of Glenpool.  ((anonymous report));2017-07-05 00:30:00;4-5 minutes;Four bright lights moving in formation south of Glenpool. Driving south on Hwy 75 towards Glenpool at night.  It was very clear.  The moon was out and stars were beginning to shine.  Saw fireworks to my left and right.   In the middle high above the fireworks 4 light objects appeared.  They looked like stars.  They appeared and the formation reminded me of the Big Dipper Constellation.  I thought, that's not the Big Dipper, it should be in the North. As I watched, the objects started moving.  The 2 in the center moved closer to each other towards a vertical position.  The top one started moving towards the 2 lining up vertically.  The bottom one was also moving in the same direction as it seemed they were going to line up eventually.  The top object reached first, once it did, it then faded and was then gone.  Then the bottom object got very close to lining up...it then faded and was gone.  Finally, the middle two started moving towards each other vertically from the horizon.  Once they got closer, they faded and were gone. I have never seen anything like this before.
