3-4 lights and/or round-egg shaped craft near Glenpool Ok, multiple times;2019-11-10 00:30:00;20 minutes;3-4 lights and/or round-egg shaped craft near Glenpool Ok, multiple times As I traveled home southbound on highway 75 at around 13:30-1:00am after leaving my job for the night.  I could see a bright light so bright I could see it as far as the creek turnpike exit to south 75.  At first I thought it was a stadium light because it was so bright.  As I crossed through glenpool I realized it was not in the town proper and was near the new St Francis hospital area.  There was no sound as I had my window down.  It was not a helicopter and sat over the road exiting to Bixby.  Other cars had pulled over to watch it and another did a u-turn to head back.  I kept traveling south because I saw one to the far right (east) of me further on and another closer one that was moving and pulsing its light to the west.  I got out my phone to record the third one and followed its erratic movement.  At first the light was so bright on this one it seemed like two colors of fire, blending and meeting in the center.  It flew so fast it seemed almost to just appear in places but I was able to keep up with it.  It ended by centering over the highway south of my and then flying slowly directly overhead.  It was dark but it had enough lights still (they had flared and dimmed) I could see it was round/egg shaped.  Between Sept 2019 and the end of Dec 2019 I saw this event approx 4 times to lesser degrees.  Every time I have seen this happen it was 3-4 lights in different spots.  The only exception to this was the final time when I saw this happen again further south past the Mounds exit over the hill heading south on hwy 75.;35.9599;-95.9935
