Red yellow orb travels erratically.;2020-04-20 20:30:00;5 minutes;Red yellow orb travels erratically I saw a red and yellow orb coming from the NE and heading towards the S.W. when I first saw it  it was the size of the cherry on my cigarette and I had to run inside and grab my phone and my fianc√© when I came back out side in 5-10 seconds it was already super far and started changing speed and moving like nothing I had ever seen .  E- W then back N-S it went behind a cloud that you  could see the stars though and never came back out .. it was really strange;33.9249;-96.4275
