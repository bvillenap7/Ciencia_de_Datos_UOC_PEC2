I am a student at the University of Oklahoma in anthropology.  I never believed in UFO's or anything like it.  In June of '97, my boyfriend and I were driving on Airport Road in Weatherford, Oklahoma.  We were in a convertible.  I was looking above the sunset when I saw a huge ball of fire fall towards the earth.  It then stopped and went straight up into the clouds.  I would've thought it was a meteor but they don't stop or change direction quite like that.  My boyfriend didn't see it.  He was watching the road I guess, but I nearly made him wreck when I screamed What is that?  It didn't take very long at all.  At the most a couple of minutes.  I don't know what it was.  I tried to figure it out and I've heard of sun dogs and all that, but the way it moved was so bizarre.  I don't think even an Air Force jet can manoevre quite like this thing did.;35.5318;-98.7028
