The ufo was approximately a couple of hundred feet directly above me. moving very very slowly across the south side of the city from east to west. It was rectangle shaped, as huge and long as a cruise ship and it had no wings.It was not black but a dark gray color-non metallic finish-it did not shine-didn't give off any reflection.It made no engine sounds-no sounds came from the ufo at all. It appeared to be to large to be traveling at such a slow speed.The ufo moved smoothly across the night sky-not fast-didn't make any sharp turns.It didn't seem to care if it was noticed- why would it be flying so low and at such a slow speed over a town of ten to twelve thousand people. I am 48 years old. I don't smoke, do drugs, or drink. I have no history of halllliciantions, nor is there any mental illness in my family. My eye-sight is good! I was sitting in a lawn chairon the frontlawn looking up and to the south at 2-3 in the morning.there were stars out no clouds.It was flying so low, and it was so huge it was impossible to miss...made no engine sound...no wings ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.
