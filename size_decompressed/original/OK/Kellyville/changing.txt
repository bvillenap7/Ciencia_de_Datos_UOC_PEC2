I have seen this object several times in the past year,this is the first time I have seen it through binoculars.It appears as a bright star, this time it was in the western sky.The object through the binoculars looked like a cylinder with white lights,I watched it off and on for about 20 min. then it started to move east/N.E. as it got closer and now north of me it looked like a triangle,there was no sound.I had husband come out to look at also.I have seen what I belive to be this same object frequently in the past year,as has my son and daughter.The background is open land with trees in areas,country in Ok.The night this happened I was told that the local radio stations were reporting sighting in Ok. and Ks.
