Strange, unidentifiable light;2021-02-24 20:15:00;4 seconds;Strange, unidentifiable light Around 8:15 P.M. on February 24, 2021 I was in my backyard working on a project when a light caught my attention from the corner of my eye. It was east of me a few miles away about 30 degrees above the horizon. It would have been between the towns of Maysville, Paoli and Pauls Valley. At first I thought it was either a helicopter or low flying plane, as I see them quite a bit in the area, but I immediately became interested because it was moving much faster than any night time craft I usually see. The light was white and oval shaped with no other blinking aircraft lights or meteor trail behind it. It was moving south at a high rate of speed and faded out entirely after 3 or 4 seconds. It was much too low in altitude and slow to be a meteor and it wasn't descending or flickering/leaving a trail of any kind. The light was steady and bright until it faded out. There was no sound and the night was completely silent. I am an avid sky watcher and can identify sate! llites, geo-stationary satellites, I.S.S., space junk, iridium flares, meteors, and craft, and it did not appear to be any of those.;34.8096;-97.4098
