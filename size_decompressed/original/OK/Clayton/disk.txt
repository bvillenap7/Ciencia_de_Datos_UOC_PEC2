Kiamichi Mountains- Hwy 271 South-glowing fire balls/UFO craft.;2013-07-17 21:52:00;10 minutes;July 17th 2013 2152pm- Kiamichi Mountains- Hwy 271 South-glowing fire balls/UFO craft July 17th Wed. 2013 2152pm–passed Clayton, Oklahoma  Driving down Hwy 271 South near Kiamichi Mountains towards city of Antlers.  We pulled over and stopped.  My husband & I noticed in the sky what looked like fire works- there were 6 circular shaped red/orange flares in the sky going one at a time from right to left, backwards to forwards.  Then went back in straight line from left to right, and the glow disappeared but we could see the shape of the “UFO” craft.   The craft was a very large and shaped very differently.  It had blue gleaming lights –almost translucent in color but you could still see its definition in the sky.  It hovered over the sky. It moved or floated  in different patterns/Up & down and sideways. In no way was this any aircraft that we have ever seen.  Seven minutes later,  2159pm, it started lighting up again, one @ a time.   Then the colors/glowing fire balls disappeared I got some photos of it on my digital camera.   Exactly 2 minutes after that we heard a loud jet engine sound going over us in the same direction of the unexplained craft in the sky.  I got pictures of the “white” jet.   Not sure if it was part of Military or not.    I have a picture of the “ UFO Craft “ can’t wait to post these photos..;34.594;-95.3816
