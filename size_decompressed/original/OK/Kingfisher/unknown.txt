Large craft moving slowly, low to ground similar to Stephenville, TX;2008-01-05 21:00:00;10 sec;Large craft moving slowly, low to ground similar to Stephenville, TX I am not the individual that saw this UFO.  The exact date of this event is not known.  It did happen before the Stephenville, TX sightings because my dad told me about it what he saw earlier that week one weekend when I went home to stay with my parents.  I know it happened before the TX sightings because when I heard about those sightings I immediately called my dad to tell him that several others had had the same experience as he.  My grandmother has been in the hospital so her dog is staying with my parents.  My dad took the dog outside in the evening before he went to bed.  He said he likes to look up at the sky while ((outside)).   He heard a faint sound of geese, like they were really high in the sky or a long way off.  When he first looked up, he could see the stars.  Then the sky went black for 5 to 10 seconds.  He said he thought it was a big flock of geese, but then realized no flock of geese could block out the sky like that.  It was then that he realized that he had just witnessed a huge craft fly over his head at a very low altitude. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
