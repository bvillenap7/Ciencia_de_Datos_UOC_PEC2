I was sitting in my living room, when I heard an ultralight aircraft flying over. I went to the front doorto view the u/l aircraft. Observing the aircraft, I noticed a bright cigar shaped object hovering behind the u/l. I went outside to get a better look at the object. When I got outside, I had a good view of the object, & it continued to hover behind the u/l aircraft for a few seconds then it traveled away from me at a very high rate of speed. (faster than any aircraft I have ever seen). I watched as the ufo got smaller as the ditance increrased.;36.6371;-95.136
