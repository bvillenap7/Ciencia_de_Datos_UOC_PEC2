Large low flying triangle in oklahoma;1996-08-01 19:00:00;2-3 minutes;large low flying triangle in oklahoma As I was driving to town I noticed a large triangular object low to the ground appear to my left & and front a short ways ahead of me.  The size, height it was flying, & speed it was moving was so unbelievable that I pulled over on the shoulder, got out of my truck & watched as slowly passed overhead from south to north.    I believe there were 3-4 other vehicles that stopped & watched in amazement as well.  The object was triangular in shape with a bright light at each point, it flew at maybe 15-20mph I would est & it made no sound whatsoever.   It flew slightly higher than the tree tops, low enough I remember thinking I could hit it with a slingshot. The craft was so close u could easily see that it was a solid, metallic object, not a balloon or blimp.   The size was the most amazing to me.  It had to be something like 300-400 ft in width & length. I've never seen anything that looked Like what I seen, the size that it was, that could move at that slow of a speed & ! stay airborne.   I have told numerous friends & family about this event, from moments after it happened to yrs later.  I never reported it due to my not being able to comprehend what it was I saw, how can I report it publicly without being laughed at.  I only do this now after seeing a program about the phoenix lights, & when they showed a picture, it was almost like I was there on the side of the road again.  It was the same object I watched pass directly over me. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));33.999161983471;-96.3752785123969
