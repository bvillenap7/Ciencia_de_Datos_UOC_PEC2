Line of lights.;2012-12-16 16:50:00;30 seconds;Line of lights West of Highway 69/75 were 4 orange colored lights in a line running east to west.  The first 3 looked to be at the same height, and the 4th (furthest west) was at a lower altitude.  I do not now the altitude, but they were much higher than any surrouding structure or power line.  The lights did not move, or fade as I watched them.  After about 30 seconds, the 1st light (farthest East) disappeared suddenly, within a few seconds the 2nd light disappeared, then the 3rd, and finally the 4th.  There is nothing of that height in the area above the business Davis Fleet Parts, which is on the access road (Westside Drive) along 69/75. I have not seen them since.
