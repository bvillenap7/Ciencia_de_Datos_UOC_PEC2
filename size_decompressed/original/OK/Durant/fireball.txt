We were walking up the driveway toward the house when we both turned toward the south to look at the sky, because we are always stargazing.  It  was very dark outside and we dont live right in town, so there are no light glares of any sort.   The objects were very clear to the eye and were firery orange,moving pretty slow toward the direction of New Mexico.  I estimate they were a mile wide, and there were 2 objects.    We are both firm believers in ufos and immediately knew that's what they were.;33.999161983471;-96.3752785123969
Wife, son and I observed two fireball objects and one silver object over Okla.;2011-07-10 22:45:00;5:00;Wife, son and I observed two fireball objects and one silver object over Okla. On July 10 th 2011, at approximately 22:45 hrs. in Durant, Okla., my wife, son and I observed two fireball shaped objects fly out of the East and head Northwest for approximately 5 minutes.  Had no strobe lights and appeared to be on fire but made no sound and headed in exact same path.  While observing a quick silver object zoomed from East to West in the blink of an eye.   Have studied astronomy for 30 years and 20 years in Law Enforcement/Security and I am clueless to what these objects were. Thanks,  ((name deleted));33.999161983471;-96.3752785123969
