possible ufo sighting;2010-07-04 23:15:00;3 min;possible ufo sighting 11:15pm Broken Arrow,Ok  My boyfriend and I were on the patio facing south and noticed this bright large ball of orange light slowly moving south to north about 1500-2000 ft in the air and moved in a straight line formation.  This object had no motor noise and was moving very slowly and did not change its flight direction.  The intensity of the light would dim and then turn bright orange as it moved across the sky.  We walked out into the yard and watched this light move slowly over head and then out of sight.  The first light went over and out of sight then a second, and third light with the same flight formation (single file) followed behind.  All objects were identical and following same flight pattern south to north across the sky with the same slow speed.  The lights were moving under the clouds and very visible to the naked eye.;36.0363179775281;-95.786031460674

A moment later we noticed a strange looking light moving from west to east it appeared a bright orange color and seemed to have a halo around it.  It appeared to be on fire. It appeared to reach the point where we had observed the other object when it turned north and then faded away. When within a few minutes two more objects appeared traveling in the same direction when they seemed to reach the point of the other two objects they appeared to turn north and also fade away.  My wife suddenly said look and there was another object coming from due south heading north we watched as this object also reached the point as the previous objects and fade away.  When we turned around ther! e were two more coming from the south one appeared bigger and brighter than the other. I looked down for a moment and when I looked back up the smaller object had disappeared.  The brighter object flew directly overhead it was a bright orange but it appeared to be a bright red light rotating to top.  The object gave the apperance to being to fire.  These objects appeared from two different directions miles apart and within minutes of each other and all seemed to be under power and control.  They all reached the same point where they began to fade. away. All to these events were witnessed by myself my wife and son.;36.0363179775281;-95.786031460674

2 fireball type objects… One cruised through the sky and then a second one appeared cruised by.  ((anonymous report));2017-12-29 23:00:00;5-8 minutes;2 fireball type objects… One appeared cruised through the sky and then a second one appeared at cruised through the sky slightly hoveri December 29, 2017 at approximately 11 PM I had just  returned from my office in Tulsa to my home in broken arrow   While unloading my SUV I looked up in the air and I saw what at first I thought was a low cruising airplane - then I realized it was on fire so it couldn't be an airplane it was making no noise it was just cruising across the night sky.  I wouldn't say it was floating, I would call it cruising…  But it did seem to pause for a while over my driveway area… Was a bit intimidating and I got behind my SUV to observe it. I pulled out my camera and took a couple of pictures as it headed south and finally disappeared.  I turned back to the north horizon and there was another object identical to the first-  coming up over the house tops across the street.  It acted in very much the same manner… A fireball making no noise -- it's seem to have a propulsion to it… Really like it was cruising. It also headed south and finally disappeared.;36.0363179775281;-95.786031460674
