Seven unexplained lights over Broken Arrow OK...2 witnes Army Vet.;2010-10-30 23:50:00;30s;Seven unexplained lights over Broken Arrow OK...2 witnes Army Vet. My spouse pulled in the drive way. I walk out side to meet her. She walks up to me, we start talking I happen to look up to the north at about 45 to 50 degree angle.  I see 7 horizontal lights in a wing span like pattern.  They where all perfectly identical and symmetry.  I ask my spouse DO YOU SEE THAT? Yes she says.  So now I know that its real.  They pass directly over us headed south, no noise, and moving fast.  But right as they pass over us the last four on the right change pattern into a box type. (...::)   Then they all start moving like they were dancing and their gone just that fast. This all happens in about 30seconds.  The lights were not very bright more like dim stars.  I just happen to have my ten inch telescope set up but there was no time..   I am a ten year combat vet and in all my time around drones and other technology I have never witnessed any thing like this.  This stuff is real.  I put my word of honor that there is something going on we don't know about.;36.0363179775281;-95.786031460674
