Large object with orange/red light.;2011-07-03 22:00:00;3 minutes;Large object with orange/red light. At first thought it was a plane, but it had a large orange/red light on the front.  It was traveling like a plane would. I have never seen what I consider an UFO.  There were military planes flying over before dark.  I had seen other planes that night flying over, but this was different. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
