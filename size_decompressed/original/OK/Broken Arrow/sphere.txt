Silver sphere moving at varying speeds and began ascent to higher altitude.;2000-11-25 14:35:00;8 minutes;Silver sphere moving at varying speeds and began ascent to higher altitude. Silver sphere came out of the East traveling to the West. The sky was clear in the observation window, with some scattered clouds to the North.  Wind was out of the NW at 12 mph.  Temperature was 52 degrees F.  Visibility 9 miles.  Movement of sphere was fast, estimate of alitude was around 12,000 ft. +, then it slowed as it came over Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, began a snake-like movement, appeared to nearly stop at times. Object then turned toward the Southwest, began a 45 degree ascent, disappeared from sight due to gaining alitude.  Sphere did not appear to be self luminous, but reflected sunlight. I first thought it may be a high altitude balloon, but the movement was too fast and due to its turn to Southwest and ascent to higher altitude. Commercial and military aircraft activity was in the area at different times during this sighting, since the area is close to the Tulsa International Airport.  I am very familiar with commercial and military aircraft, research balloons, sundogs and other unusual atmospheric phenomena.  Both my wife and I observed the object.  I was involved for 30 years in the investigation of the UFO phenomenon and was an associate to Dr. J. Allen Hynek.  I do not know what the object was, therefore it remains a UFO.;36.0363179775281;-95.786031460674
Orange orb in the sky vanishes.....;2004-03-10 00:30:00;2-3 mins;Orange orb in the sky vanishes..... I was standing on the driveway saying goodbye to eachother one evening.  We were looking in the northern sky and about 30 degrees up from the horizon there was an orange orb.  It stood out from the stars arround it and there were no airplanes in the sky.  It hovered, I would say, about 30 miles away.  We were in a suburbian area just out of Tulsa.  Just as I brought this strange orb to my fathers attention it disappeared.  Didn't move...Just disappeared.  There was not a cloud in the sky.;36.0363179775281;-95.786031460674
5-6 Reddish Orange Orbs spotted around the greater Tulsa area 4th July night.;2013-07-04 18:30:00;4 hours;5-6 Reddish Orange Orbs spotted around the greater Tulsa area 4th July night. I am a student and the wife is an Administrator at a local company.  On the evening of July 4th at sunset the wife and I went into the back yard to watch the fireworks and immediately spotted a reddish orange sphere in the sky moving very slowly.  The wife said it was a touring helo giving rides for the fireworks which is common but it was glowing and had no strobes.  After dismissing it, 10 to 15 minutes later,another one appeared taking roughly the same flight path, then another.  They traveled together and seemed to be circling the greater Tulsa city limits on the east side at about the same altitude as a traffic helo or the small Cessna that fly over head most days. At any given time until we retired for the evening at least one of these orbs could be seen.  In total I spotted the first one northeast of my location at sunset, then the two in about the same local a bit later, then after dark one to the south, then ten or twenty minutes later one northwest that appeared to be over midtown and lastly before we retired at 2300 hours one or two over the greater Bixby area to the west/southwest. None of them made any sound.  With a small air strip nearby and living near the landing path from the Tulsa International Airport we see lot of air traffic and it ALL makes noise.  Several balls flew fairly close to us, as close as some of the Cessna, so if it was making noise we would have heard it. As I had just taken Astronomy class I had been monitoring the night sky often and I never observed objects like these before or since.;36.0363179775281;-95.786031460674
