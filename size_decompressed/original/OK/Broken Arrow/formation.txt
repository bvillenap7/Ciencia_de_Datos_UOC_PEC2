Other planes were in the area that seemed to be chasing them.  The lights would fade out of view once a plane got close, then would come back when the plane was far enough away.  Me and my fiance saw this. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));36.0363179775281;-95.786031460674
I saw 6 UFO's tonight in a v shape around Venus;2020-03-31 21:41:00;1 minute;I saw 6 UFO's tonight in a v shape around Venus I was taking night pictures with my S20 Ultra and was trying to get the moon and Venus in the shot and went back to look at the pictures and noticed lights that weren't in one picture but were in others and then took another picture a few minutes later and the lights were clearly a v formation that were moving.  In one picture they were a v formation and the a cluster of six near Venus and in two others they were blurry but still barely present.  I have the pictures for proof.;36.0363179775281;-95.786031460674
