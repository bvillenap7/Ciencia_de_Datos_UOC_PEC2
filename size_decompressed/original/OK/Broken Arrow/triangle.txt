Flying objects in bird-like formation;2014-09-06 23:55:00;15-20 seconds;Flying objects in bird-like formation On Saturday night, September 6, 2014, shortly before midnight a group of neighbors and I were outside with a fire pit, just hanging out and talking in our hometown of Broken Arrow, Oklahoma.  My friend was in mid-sentence of telling a story when she stopped and said “WHAT IS THAT???” pointing up to the sky.   3 of us girls stood up and turned around to see what she was pointing at. It was a formation of flying objects that appeared to be illuminated but not lit up sort of in a bird formation. We watched this formation go across our heads for about 20 seconds starting from the north and disappearing toward the south. One of the women’s husbands mentioned this website as he is intrigued by situations like this. I just looked over the front page posts and they are VERY similar to what we saw.;36.0363179775281;-95.786031460674
