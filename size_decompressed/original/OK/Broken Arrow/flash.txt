I and two other friends were standing outside my grandparents house by the street light.  That night was a fall night clean crisp air yet low lying clouds about 200 ft up.  We were standing around talking when in the clouds above us a flash of multi-colored lights went off.  Lights were of the color spectrum.  It took about 3 seconds and stopped.  No rain nor thunder or lighting that night just cloud coverage.  We all simultaneously looked up and were baffled by what just happened.;36.0363179775281;-95.786031460674
