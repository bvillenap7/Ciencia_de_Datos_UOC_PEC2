A point of light that would move very fast then stop then move again changing directions and even reversing its course.;2008-02-29 22:02:00;47 minutes;A point of light that would move very fast then stop then move again changing directions and even reversing its course. My wife and I saw a point of light similar to a star or satellite.  After watching a few minutes, it would stop suddenly and completely, then it would suddenly move again at what seemed to be a very high rate of speed.  When it started moving it would sometimes change its direction of travel and would even reverse its course.  It would move only a few degrees with each movement but after a time it had traveled across half the sky. When we first saw the light, it was near the left foot of the Orion constellation.  Even though it was changing course, its general direction of travel was to the north.  We have watched many airplanes and satellites travel in the night sky and this one moved like nothing we have ever seen.;36.0363179775281;-95.786031460674
Two orange lights moving across the sky in formation and then each one dimmed and disappeared.;2010-05-15 01:20:00;3-5 minutes;Two orange lights moving across the sky in formation and then each one dimmed and disappeared. We pulled out of the jack in the box drive thru around 1:20am and parked to eat our food. We looked up in the sky and there were 2 orange lights in a direct line from each other moving northwest simultaneously.  I couldn't see any clear shape of a ship or anything, but the lights definitely looked like they were attached to something that was moving.  The way the lights were lined up made the possible shape look disc shaped or cylindrical.  It moved extremely slowly across the sky and then one light slowly started dimming and completely disappeared.  The the other light kept moving in the original direction until it started dimming as well and then completely disappeared.  We are so creeped out.;36.0363179775281;-95.786031460674
Bright white light becomes two bright lights over Broken Arrow Oklahoma;2010-08-05 03:15:00;5 minutes;Bright white light becomes two bright lights over Broken Arrow Oklahoma while on my back porch facing south at approx 0315am 5 august I looked into the sky and noticed what I thought was an aircraft approaching the tulsa oklahoma area.   The lights however were not getting any closer, more of a hover than movement...I saw one extremely bright white light and red and green lights on the side..the light than split into two separate lights, still remaining in a hover type position.  The two lights moved slowly to the west.  NOt getting any further away from the other white light.  I watched as the lights on both craft became brighter than as quickly as I had seen the lights they were gone.  I witnessed this alone.  The lights were at an attitude that would have indicated to me it was a plane.  Ones that fly over a city more than are heading into a city.;36.0363179775281;-95.786031460674
Two orange lights moving in line with each other then fading separately.;2013-07-03 01:20:00;5 minutes;Two orange lights moving in line with each other then fading separately. Two orange lights moving in sync going northwest, one faded away then a few minutes later the other faded away.  Clearly NOT airplanes or helicopters.  Moved very slowly.;36.0363179775281;-95.786031460674
Lights in formation over South Broken Arrow, Ok;2013-08-22 21:30:00;3-5 minutes;Lights in formation over South Broken Arrow, Ok At about 9:30pm, my wife, myself, and my neighbor who is a police officer for the district attorney's office were sitting in our garage talking.  My wife was sitting facing northwest and made a comment about something moving fast in the sky.   I turned to look, and what we first saw was a bright white light approaching from northwest to southeast.  As it got closer it appeared to get brighter.  I did not observe any flashing red or green lights, or white strobes, no engine or rotor noise, so I thought maybe a low orbit satellite.    As it flew more directly overhead, the light seemed to fade and then disappear, still traveling southeast.  As I was looking at that object, my wife and neighbor pointed out another object behind it traveling the same height and direction.  What made the second object different is, as it approached, one light turned to two.   Then three in a triangle shape.  Then, 4 lights, till it was overhead and you could see 6 lights arranged in ! a hexagon shape.  At this point I had grown into more disbelief because once again, no engine noise, no rotor sound, no strobes or red and green lights.  We have planes and helicopters that fly over regularly, and all of those aircraft are unmistakably what they appear.   These two objects were traveling too fast for that.   I noticed my neighbors across the street were sitting in their garage with a group of 4 or 5 other people and I had to point this out to them.  We all were watching as the six lights kept traveling together in a hexagon formation and eventually faded out as it continued traveling southeast.   Most airplanes as they pass over their strobes and lights are still visible for several miles.  These objects were not like that.  Probably more directed in front and straight down or maybe they just faded off as it went overhead and on.  I have never seen lights arranged in a hexagon formation on any aircraft I have ever seen and I used to work on aircraft years ago ! so I am familiar with how aircraft lighting is.  Whatever it w! as, it w as not civilian or commercial.  I will point out my neighbor police officer is also ex military and he was as perplexed as I was.  I waited to report this because I thought surely this could have a reasonable explanation but the more I kept thinking about it, the more I couldn't ignore what I saw.;36.0363179775281;-95.786031460674
Happend to look up, NE of Broken arrow was a VERY bright shiny light.  ((anonymous report));2019-12-02 20:09:00;15 seconds;I was out walking the dog.  He to look up and a long ways away to the NE of Broken arrow was a VERY bright shiny light.  I thought it was a bright star.  As I looked at it for about 5 seconds it accelerated at a speed I have never seen before.  As it moved it did not have a tail of light or anything.  It just disappeared out of the atmosphere.;36.0363179775281;-95.786031460674
