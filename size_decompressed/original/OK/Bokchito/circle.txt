round, luminous, pulsating object with dull places moving across the southwestern horizon then vanished 7/76;1976-07-15 23:00:00;10-15 SECONDS;round, luminous, pulsating object with dull places moving across the southwestern horizon then vanished 7/76 My husband had just come in from an Army Reserve week-end (Sunday night) he was in the shower, and I was cleaning up the kitchen.  At the time, I was almost nine months pregnant with our first child.  As I went to the back poarch (we live in a very rural area), I caught a glimps of a bright, luminous cicular object moving across the horizon in front of me.  The object seemed to have a pulsating action to it like a heart, and the entire object would dim the brighten back up.  There was darker areas in it, but it too was not so dark that it did not look luminous or pulsate. I began screaming for my husband to come to me, but before he could get our of the shower and get there the thing just took off across the horizon and disappeared - vanished.  When I began explaining to my husband what I had seen, his comment was, Grandmother saw the same thing several years ago.  She described the same identical thing to me.  Grandmother had lived in this house for years before she had to be put in her oldest daughter's home due to poor health - just one half mile to the west of this area.  For a long time, we did not share what I saw with anyone it is still to this day very disturbing to me.  But - while watching SciFi's UFO documentaries, I have seen the same object as other witnesses.  This has helped me. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
