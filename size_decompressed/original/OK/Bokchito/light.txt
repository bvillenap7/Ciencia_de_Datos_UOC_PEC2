Bright orange/blue light moving really fast then disapearing.;2011-08-01 00:00:00;3-4 minutes;bright orange/blue light moving really fast then disapearing. A bright light changing from blue to orange, it was moving side to side.  Then suddenly it shot straight up, maybe five hundred feet, faster than anything I've ever seen.  After that it was stationary for about thirty seconds then it flashed brightly and disappeared.  There was no sound but it was quite far away.   This is the second time I've seen it.  I don't know what it is but it was scary and I don't need to see it again! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));33.9882;-96.1621
