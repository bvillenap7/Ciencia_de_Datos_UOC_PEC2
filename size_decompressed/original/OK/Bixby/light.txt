The next time we saw it it came from the south easy and seemed to appear out of no where and moved the same way as the first object, the third possible sighting appeared to be the same thing but I truly don’t know if it was my eyes playing tricks on me at that point, we tried I capture a video but there was too much light pollution. I’m a skeptic and consider these story’s to be crazy but I truly don’t think what I saw was man made.;35.9463;-95.8757
