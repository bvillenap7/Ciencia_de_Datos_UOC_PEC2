Triangular lights in sky over Bixby, OK.;2019-02-19 06:45:00;1-2 minutes;Triangular lights in sky over Bixby, OK. Driving to work, heading north bound on Highway 64, crossing over the Arkansas River Bridge. Spotted what appeared to be a large triangular object gliding through the sky, heading north.  It was completely invisible in the dark sky except for the three lights at each point.  It also had a small blinking light and was completely silent.  This object did not behave like most aircraft Iâ€™ve encountered.  My logical assumption is that it is a Stealth bomber, but I thought it might be worth mentioning. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness did not provide a date of the sighting.  We have sent her an e-mail, to clarify the date, but have not heard back, yet.  PD));35.9463;-95.8757
