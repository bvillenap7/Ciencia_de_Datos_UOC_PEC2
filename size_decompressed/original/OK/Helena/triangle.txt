Suspicious Object In The Sky;2010-10-18 02:45:00;3 seconds;Suspicious Object In The Sky Approximately 0245 on Monday, October 18, 2010, I was standing outside my house looking toward the eastern sky, and I saw an object fly from the north side of my home and flew south.  The object appeared lower in the sky then normal jets that fly though all the time.  There was no sound as with a normal jet.  The object covered the distance from the prison that is ½ block from on the north east side my house, to past the rail road tracks which is ½ block south east of my house in approximately 3 seconds, my property covers one entire city block.  The object was in the shape of a triangle, with lights on all three sides.  The lights did not appear to strobe, as would an airplane, and they did not seem to be just at the three points of the triangle, but rather all along the three sides.  The object had a strange appearance to it, if you saw the movie Predator with Arnold Schwarzenegger, the object seemed to have the same shimmer as the alien did in the movie.  The object appeared to travel in a straight line, not moving around or at different speeds.  There is an US Air Force Base 30 some odd miles south west of my home, Vance Air Force Base.;36.5398;-98.2781
