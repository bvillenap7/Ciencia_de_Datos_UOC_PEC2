Red glowing objects seen over Checotah ok on the 4th of July 2012!;2012-07-04 21:00:00;2 hours;red glowing objects seen over Checotah ok on the 4th of July 2012! my mother went to the street faceing the southeast watching for neighborhood fireworks when immediately she came running in to the house telling me there was a red object traveling horizantly toward the north appareing to follow the train track.   I went out side to observe what she had seen but when i got out there the thing object had disappeared. minutes later while another red glowing ball fallowing the same path above train tracks, the third object appeared some 15 minutes later with another one following closely behind.  Approximately every 15 minutes these bright firery colored aircraft (?)  traveled over the tracks north seeming to be traveling to the same destination.  As the fireworks began to subside around 23:00 hr no more objects were seen by either of us.  There was no sound such as an aircraft motor of any kind heard by us.   My mom is 52 years old and has never observed anything like that before, our home faces the train tracks and we have lived here ! more then 5 years and have never witnessed anything like this before! mom pulled out here binoculars and couldn't get a focus on them, we don't know why!  I even captured the objects on video the best I could!!;35.4391;-95.5273
