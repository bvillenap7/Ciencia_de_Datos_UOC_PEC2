Late one night, while traveling to my wifes grandmothers house in Cleveland Oklahoma, we had an experience that has always dumbfounded us as to what we had actually experienced. As I mentioned earlier it was very late at night and we were traveling along some lonley dark stretches of highway, way off the beaten path as you might say..My wife was asleep in her seat across from me and I was listening to the radio with my window rolled part part way down so I wouldn't get sleepy...As I was driving I began to hear what sounded like a high pitched humming sound..I thought maybe I had a tire going flat so I slowed my speed down to about 45mph to see if the sound would degrade accordingly, but it didn't...regardless of my speed the sound remained constant in pitch and intensity...After a few minutes of hearing this sound I decided to pull my car over to the side of the road and do a visual check of my tires to be certain they were ok...With the car stopped and engine turned off I got out with a flashlight to have a look..my wife had woken up during this time and I had told her what I was doing..It was pitch black outside and the only light were my headlights and the stars above..The sound was still there and I asked my wife to get out of the car and see if we could determine where the sound was coming from, because it sounded like it was coming from everywhere...I decided to look up and this was when I noticed that some of the stars were being blocked out by something moving and the size of the leading edge of whatever this thing was , was un-believeable! Accordingly the stars were being blocked out to the east and west as far as we could see in either direction as the object moved to the north...The object had to be over a mile in width and length and low to the ground... After 10 minutes of watching this thing  the object finally completed moving over us, because we were finally able to see the stars re-appearing to the back of the craft. We continuously watched this black craft until we could no longer see! its out line in the stars or hear it.  The craft was moving very slow according to our perspective on the ground since the speed the stars were disappearing in front of the craft and re-appearing at the back of the craft was somewhat slow...At first we thought it was a blimp flying close to the ground but there were no lights at all on the craft, so we decided it wasn't a blimp..Having just gotten out of the Air Force after 4 years of service, I was pretty familiar with most of our military and civil aircraft at the time, but I had never seen anything like this before and believe me I had seen alot of weird things in and around the many air bases I was stationed at..
