I was going to work northbound on 151 across lake Keystone at 511 am  on 11/16/98 sw of Tulsa Ok.  when I saw a bright whight fireball at aprox. 075 deg. going almost streight down. The fireblall was about 1/32 the size the size of a full moon and it It lit up the sky like a lightning storm could,  I could see the ground and leaves on trees.  the tail would be about four times the dia. of a full moon and blue in color.   My friend in the pass. seat also noticed it.  The next morning I saw 14 meteors and nothing looked like the bright one with the blue tail.  ((deleted))@aol.com;35.9936;-96.5242
