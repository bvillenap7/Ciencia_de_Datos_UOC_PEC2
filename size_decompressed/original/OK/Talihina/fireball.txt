Four orange fireballs witnessed hovering very close to ground in Oklahoma that beamed white light to ground.;2012-12-12 18:41:00;80 seconds;Four orange fireballs witnessed hovering very close to ground in Oklahoma that beamed white light to ground. 1841 hrs.:  Four lights seen in southern night sky. Four orange fireballs lit up individually to form straight line then went off.  This sequence repeated once & lasted approx 20 seconds.  Windows down in car, heard low roar that lasted approximately 30 seconds.  Clear night sky, no jets or planes seen flying over...would have to have been low for that kind of roar. 1845 With our truck still in park facing east, to the south outside truck window, very close (maybe 1/4 to 1/2 football field if that) a white light lit up the ground. Light was approximately size of our truck.  It remained stationary.  The light shined on the ground for approximately 30 seconds.    At first I thought the light was car lights, but that is impossible because we were on private property behind locked gates in the country and we are 100% positive we were alone. I thought I could see something in the light but it was too dark. 1917 Home. I have developed headache to right side of head (side facing light) and now have various buzzing feelings in my body. Clarification:  Orange lights were not visible while white light beamed to ground.**    I was unable to get images. (Other residents of this area have witnessed these lights.   I hope they will report what they have seen as well.);34.7347;-94.9998
Ascending fireball from Buffalo Mountain.;2015-04-23 19:00:00;~10 minutes;Ascending fireball from Buffalo Mountain. Line of sight was south near high school looking northwest.  One single fireball rose vertically from the summit of Buffalo Mtn. to approximately 45 degrees against a mostly clear sky.  Hovering for approximately 3 minutes, it began to move in a straight line toward the northeast.  It appeared to be traveling at a speed unlikely for conventional aircraft. Within several minutes it had moved completely out of sight.   Not more than 2 minutes later, a nearly silent helicopter, traveling at tree level from the east quickly disappeared at the base of Buffalo Mtn. Observer was approximately 4 miles from the mountain.  It should be noted that the strangeness of the object coming out of the mountain was further magnified by the observation of the helicopter traveling toward the sighting in what the observer describes as stealth mode.;34.7347;-94.9998
