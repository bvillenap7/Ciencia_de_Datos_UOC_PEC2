Large triangle shaped obj. with lights at each corner.  Red/white light pulsing at the center.  ((NUFORC Note:  Comm. pilot rept.  PD));2015-05-27 22:30:00;3 minutes;Large triangle shaped object with lights at each corner.  Red/white light pulsing at the center. Hello,  I was walking out to our shop at 10:30pm CST because I saw the lights had been left on in the back of the building.  While walking back to the building, I heard a low rumble and expected to see an aircraft overhead.  I saw a large triangle shaped vehicle directly overhead.  At first I thought it was at about 2000 ft agl, but I noticed the rumble noise was trailing the vehicle so I think it must have been higher.  This object was against a clear moon lit sky and was black and easily defined in shape.  It had bright white lights at each of the three corners with a pulsing red/white light in the center.  I am a commercial pilot and can identify aircraft easily.  This aircraft did not have the standard red/green indicator light.   I was heading on a straight northerly heading and as it past I saw what appeared to be a extension, like a drogue line with a pulsing red/white light, so I was thinking it might be a military aircraft refueler.  But as it continued on its heading, I watch as the extended object began to rotate around and above the object and it remained in that position until over the horizon.;35.2665;-94.9004
