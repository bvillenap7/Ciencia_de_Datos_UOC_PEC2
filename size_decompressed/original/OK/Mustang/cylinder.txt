I was riding with my daughter either back or to a store...(I cant really remember)...When we saw this object hanging in the sky...to me it seemed like a jet without wings, We observed this craft for awhile...like I said, It looked to me like a jet without wings...aand it just hovered for the longest time...that is all I remember...then my daughter recently told me she chased it...I remember nothing of that...But I do remember having a sort of vision that night of a bug with huge eyes, and I have spent 10 years trying to figure out what all that was about...I finally put it together like a puzzle...but it took me 10 years to do it...So I am here to tell you...it does happen...it happened to me...

2 groups of 3 to 6 bright orange cylindrical objects appearing and then disappearing as though they &quotburned out&quot.;2021-01-03 22:20:00;3 minutes;2 groups of 3 to 6 bright orange cylindrical objects appearing and then disappearing as though they &quotburned out&quot. Observed 2 groups of 3 to 6 objects traveling from South to North, east of my location at a relatively slow speed.  First group appearing and disappearing while the second appears approx. 1 minute later. The objects seemed to “ burn out “ when disappearing.  Not disappearing because of distance issue. Objects appeared as a bright orange cylindrical form with traces of light blue around the edges. No trailing tail.  Seemed to have a “waving appearance”.  Entire sighting lasting approx. 2 to 3 minutes.;35.3882;-97.7261
