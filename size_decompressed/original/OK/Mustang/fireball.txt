Fireballs over Mustang, OK.;2013-10-26 23:00:00;8-10 minutes;Fireballs over Mustang, OK First noticed 2 fireballs moving slowly from NW to SE as I was looking sw from my home. By the time I thought to grab my cell phone to document the event they had disappeared behind the clouds. Appx 3-5 minutes later a second formation of two fireballs appeared following the same path. It is the second group that I videoed using My IPhone. I do live appx 10 miles from Will Rogers airport but these objects did not follow any flight path I am familiar with.  I continued observing until these also disappeared behind the clouds. These objects were not far away at a height of appx 2000 feet.  There was no sound associated with these objects.;35.3882;-97.7261
