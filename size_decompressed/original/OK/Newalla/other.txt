Grape size fast moving lights.;1995-08-17 00:00:00;2 minutes;Grape size fast moving lights. It was the end of summer, 1995. Newalla, Oklahoma, Cleveland County. I lived on 1 and 1/3 acres, dog and I did our nightly walk around the house.  This night some movement and lights caught my eye in the plum thicket. I was watching them when dog ran to the front door and would not come when I called him, he was shaking and frightened. Then all of a sudden the illuminated lightes were right in front of my face, the size of a large grape and smooth with no markings as I remember. There were 5 of them, in a formation like geese fly.  There was no sound and the light was more of a glow and did not shine. It was only a few seconds close to my face when they whoosed into the empty lot next door, they were very fast and moved as one, I will never forget it. I am a retired hairdresser and at the time I was 48 years old. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));35.3721;-97.2002
Fast, tiny, lights, glowing not giving off light like a flashlight.;1998-06-10 22:00:00;60 seconds;Fast, tiny, lights, glowing not giving off light like a flashlight. It had just gotten dark outside, and I went to the North end of my mobile home and looked into the backyard.  My dog was on the porch shaking and would not come with me. I saw what could have been lightening bugs, but they moved too fast, and the light from them was more white rather than yellow. One led and the others followed, whoosh, they were in front of me from the distance of an acre on the back property line. They were right in front of my face, for a couple of seconds, then whoosh, went to the empty lot next door, then vanished.  My dog still shaking and would not come when I called him. These things were round, about the size of a grape, and the light stayed steady. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));35.3721;-97.2002
