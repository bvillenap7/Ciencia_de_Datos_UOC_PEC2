Blue-Green Fireball spotted, oklahoma city area.;2008-01-02 20:45:00;8 seconds;Blue-Green Fireball spotted, oklahoma city area. I was driving south on Peebly road, about 10-15 miles south of I-40.  Out of the corner of my eye I caught the object coming across the horizon from the east.   When it reached over about my 2 o'clock, it slowed to a stop in a very short distance.  It was stopped just enough time for me to take a glance up at it, and get a look.  While it was traveling, it was a blue-green fireball with a good tail that faded fast.  When it stopped, it kept its blue-green color around it, in a circular shape, then proceeed on a western course.   It had to have been in the upper stratosphere, it had no noise to it. Not even 3 minutes after the object leaves, an aircraft was out circling the area where I had seen it.  At first I thought, well maybe its  just a student pilot, or an aircraft shooting an approach out at Tinker AFB. The aircraft was some sort of jet, i could hear it from the car, and it was more than likley a fighter (f-16's and f-15's are at tinker) because of the high angle banks it was making.   Also, that area where the jet was flying around is not an authorized training point for fighter jets, so all I can think is that this object was picked up on radar and a jet was sent to go check it out.;35.3721;-97.2002
