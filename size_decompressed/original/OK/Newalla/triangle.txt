Triangle shaped no sound no light;2011-11-08 20:00:00;9 sec;Triangle shaped no sound no light I just want to know if other people seen what Iâ€™ve seen. I grew up on a military base and have not seen this aircraft before.  Black hawk is the closest I can think of but they make sounds.  I was looking up in the sky at a bright star near the moon when my eye caught an object flying west to east with No lights, No sound, No trail behind it, and moving pretty fast.   The object was V-shaped.   At first I thought it was a plain carrying people till I saw not lights, sounds, ect.  It was BIG and Long.  Peaceful watching it though.  Also its a cloudy stormy night so eyes can be playing tricks.;35.3721;-97.2002
