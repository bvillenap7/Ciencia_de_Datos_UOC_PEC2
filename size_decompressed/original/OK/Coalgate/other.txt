Neon green cluster of spiraled worm shaped lights, about 15 to 20 of them, different lengths, that seemed to spill out from a single point in the sky, just above tree level.  They grew longer the further from the origin point they moved.  Seemed to move by spiraling and spinning. No extra light or glow where the lights seemed to spill out of.  About 100 feet north of this area, another group of about four of these lights start spilling out of a point, but not as fast or as many.  Then they all seem to go out there is no flying off, they just disappear.;34.5345;-96.2184
