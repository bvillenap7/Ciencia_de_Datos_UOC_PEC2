Bright Light (White) seen above small rural South Eastern Oklahoma town;2005-12-12 18:30:00;15 minutes;Bright Light (White) seen above small rural South Eastern Oklahoma town Driving home last night about 4 miles west of Coalgate, noticed a bright,white,light north of town that was visable for a few seconds and then would disappear. The light appeared to be stationary because everytime it would reappear it was in pretty much the same location in the sky.  Then after a few seconds of not seeing it, I noticed several bright lights streak very fast across the sky heading south lasting only a couple of seconds as if it was leaving and then disappeared for good. (so I thought) About 5 to 10 minutes later, I was on the other side of Coalgate heading east and continued to look to the south to see if I could notice the bright light again.  I then saw the light appear again and immediately began to slow my car down so I could get a good look. Stopped in the middle of the road I noticed two smaller orange lights, one above the other which lasted only a few seconds before disappearing. As an oncoming car was heading my direction I began to drive off again and looking back to where I saw the two orange lights I saw what appeared to be a slow moving orange fireball which was leaving a small tail behind it. This only lasted for a few seconds and then was gone for good.  I personally don't believe in spacecraft or whatever so I'm sure there is a perfect explaination of what I saw. Just wondering if anyone else noticed this on the night of Dec. 12 2005 in South Eastern Oklahoma near Coalgate and appeared to be heading toward s Atoka Oklahoma.;34.5345;-96.2184
