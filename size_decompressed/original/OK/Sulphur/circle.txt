At first it was behind trees but then it increased it's altitude and moved above the trees. I thought it was no more than 100 yds. away.  Another witness thought it was no closer than 1 mile.  At first it's movement was slow and steady, moving toward the west while traveling up and down.  It looked more like it was floating as apposed to flying (at first).  After a minute or two, it picked up speed moving toward the west or northwest.  At this point, I grabbed my binoculars and lost visual contact for a few seconds.  When I found it in my binoculars, it was traveling at a high rate of speed and had a flashing red light on it's tail like an airplane.  One of the witnesses confirmed that I was indeed still observing the same object.  It now moved and looked like an airplane.  I couldn't see wings or anything like that but like I said, it now had a flashing red light on it's tail.  When the red light would blink, the front portion of the object appeared to have a slight tint of yellow to it.  I noticed that I could hear a jet in the far distance but have no idea if it was coming from an actual airplane or from this object.;34.5102;-96.9764
