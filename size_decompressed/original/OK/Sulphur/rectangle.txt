The object was about 15 yards away, it was rectangular - about 3 inches high, 12 inches long, uncertain of the width, it was aluminum foil in color, it was traveling from West to East in a straight line approx. 10 feet off the ground.  I was facing North, it was traveling from my left to my right.  I first saw directly in front of me front of me for about 1 or 2 seconds (in the direction of a farm pond on my property), when it was right in front of me it vanished (I could not see it for 1 of 2 seconds) then it again appeared to my right about 20 feet farther to the East continuing in the same direction it had been traveling and I saw it for 1 or 2 seconds as it traveled away from me.   I estimate its rate of speed was 10-15 MPH - about as fast as a man can run.  It never reappeared.;34.5102;-96.9764
