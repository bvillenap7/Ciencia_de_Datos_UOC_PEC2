Spotted craft through 16x 50 power binocs. Craft travedl from S.W. to N.W. watched for approx 3 min, then just blinked out. On 2-23-98 I was star gazing in my back yard, I live on top of a slight hill and have clear view of stars. Approximately 2030 hrs I observed a bright flash in the S.W. sky almost like a flashlight beam that hit just my area. Immediately a egg shapped craft of yellow/white light appeared in the center of where the flash occured. The craft was motionless for a few seconds, then slowly traveled N.W. at a slow speed. I watched it stop once more for a few seconds, after a complete stop, continued N.W. direction gaining altitude and just blinked out.;34.9287717948718;-95.7598128205128
