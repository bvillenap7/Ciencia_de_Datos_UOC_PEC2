Driving south bound on Indian Nation Turnpike. I first noticed the mile long lights in the sky in the south east about 5 miles away.  I pulled over as the craft was fully illuminated.  I then noticed that the lights became a greyish over red and these half disc objects are now separating from the whole main body.  There must have been about 18 half disc crafts, and as they would separate the lights would go off.   After all crafts have now separated there was no activity for a few minutes.   Thinking it was all over I began to proceed down the highway and noticed that they would turn on their lights only for seconds in communication.  I stopped again and watched these tiny red and white strobing orbs fill the sky, there must have been thousands.  The larger crafts would not allow themselves to be seen while the smaller orbs were present.  The orbs were really close and I tried to communicate with them by flashing my headlights with no response from them.  I tried to vi! deo record them also with a cell phone.  The larger ones would not stay on long enough at a time. Only the smaller ones and I caught one on video.;34.9287717948718;-95.7598128205128
