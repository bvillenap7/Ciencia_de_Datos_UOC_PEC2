Suddenly, there was a thin orange streak that went from in front of the plane, straight south, in a second or less. There was no noise other than the plane. The plane immediately cut all lights, and never turned them back on while it was within my hearing ramge. The streak was obviously some type of aircraft, but were it not for the streak, I would have never known it was there. I actually live 13 miles due north of McAlester, in a rural area. It was a Sunday night, fully dark, and clear with lots of stars but no moon. I was out gathering wood when I heard an airplane. I looked up and saw the lights of a small prop plane. As I watched it travelling almost directly overhead, heading north, I suddenly saw an orange streak of light that begin immediately in front of the plane, and travelled due south, appearing to fly over the plane. It was gone in a fraction of a second. If I had not been looking at exactly that spot, I would never have seen it. I watched to the south for several minutes to see if any lights or exhaust would appear in the direction the streak had went, but none ever appeared. Strangely, as soon as the streak went over the plane, the plane turned out it's lights, all of them, and never turned them back on while it was within my hearing range. This is not the first time I have witnessed such a streak. The first time was in 1994 just east of McAlester. Again on a dark, starry, no-moon night.;34.9287717948718;-95.7598128205128
