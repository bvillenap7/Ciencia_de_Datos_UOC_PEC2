Me and a companion were driving back home from a friend's house and we saw what we thought were stars(because they weren't moving at the time). There were three of them very close together in the shape of a triangle. But there wasn't any other stars out because it was still daylight. We both pointed them out at the same time and thought it was pretty strange to see stars out that early especially in that formation. Shortly after we spotted them they flew off in opposite directions. I have an open mind when it comes to U.F.O. sightings, but I'm not saying that they were U.F.O.s because to me I didn't see a flying saucer all I saw were three star like objects in the sky but it makes me wonder exactly what it was we saw that evening.;35.8158;-94.6364
