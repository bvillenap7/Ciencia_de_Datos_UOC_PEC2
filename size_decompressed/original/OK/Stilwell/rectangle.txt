Grandfather called myself and grandmother outside to look at object, we viewed the common description of a 300 ft. long black rectangle craft.  It moved from north to south about 100 ft or so in the air.  No sound was noticed and I don't recall any lights.  It drifted past and we watched until we couldn't see it any longer.  One of the most vivid memories I have.   Nothing else was abnormal as best as I can recall. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));35.8158;-94.6364
