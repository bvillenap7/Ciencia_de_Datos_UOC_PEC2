I was driving south of Stilwell, OK, going towards Sallisaw when I saw what I assumed was a helicopter flying above one of the hills.  The craft stopped and remained stationary for several seconds....then shot straight up so fast I could barely see it.  Then it was gone.  Whole incident lasted less than a minute.  Helicopters are common in this area,  but i have never known one to shoot straight up,  especially at that speed.;35.8158;-94.6364

Just hovering in one spot for about 2 minutes. it disappeared when an airplane was getting closer. A friend and i saw it a few days earlier in the same location.  Theres a lake around the area, could be collecting water. Also we noticed the pets and wildlife in the area went silent.;35.8158;-94.6364
