I've been seeing them every night for the last week but last night and tonight there was movement. Last night about this time, there were four multi-colored lights and one bright solid white light hovering over north-east of Elmore City. (I live out in the boondocks and these lights were quite a ways away so I'm having to use lights on the horizon line to determine where close they were located.)  The multi-colored lights stayed pretty stationary but the white light would slightly sway in position and ascend or descend minutely.  I got freaked out and went inside so I'm not sure what happened later in the evening. Tonight there is only 2 multi-colored lights and no solid white present. I went outside and sat on the porch to watch them and the multi-colored light more to the east of the other started a north by north-west path until I could no longer see it.  The other multi-colored stayed stationary. I could not tell exactly what shape the multi-colored lights are since they're at a higher elevation. All I see are lights that do not resemble any pattern of a jet or helicopter that I have seen.  The white one last night however had a triangular/arrow shape to it when it was ascending. Last night when I spotted the white object I checked my cellular phone and the service was gone. I usually have 3-4 bars of service in my home. Like I said I live out in the boondocks so I don't have street lights or cars running all over the place. I live on a small farm with animals and they are asleep for the night. There were no noise. We have a lot of cloud cover so there were no stars visible.;34.6277;-97.4149
