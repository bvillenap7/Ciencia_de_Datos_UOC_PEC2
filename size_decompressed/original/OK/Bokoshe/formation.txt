I looked out my car window at the sky and immediately noticed 15-20 lights. ((NUFORC Note:  Cluster of Starlink satellites.  PD));2019-11-12 18:32:00;1-2 minutes;While stopping at a store outside of Bokoshe Oklahoma, I looked out my car window at the sky and immediately noticed 15-20 lights about as bright as the north star in a perfect line slowly moving to the South. It was amazing. There was no sound or pulsing lights. They had to be very high in altitude. I got extremely excited when they all moved slowly to the left and faded out fairly fast almost as if they were moving up and away. They were clearly there and my wife also watched it. If it was military I have never seen that many aircrafts fly that spread out and then fade into the sky like that. These were clearly not any reflection or satellites. Just perfectly round white balls of light in a perfect line, the way the faded out and up gave me chills. P.S. I have never seen any proof of UFOs or ever really cared, but after today I am pretty convinced.;35.1836;-94.7887
