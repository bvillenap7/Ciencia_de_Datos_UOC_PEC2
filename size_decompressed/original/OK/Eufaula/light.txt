Looking over the house toward the south, I saw a very bright light, as light as a night light.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly Venus?  PD));2018-11-27 05:05:00;15 minutes;I get up early to let the dog out, this day it was 5 am, standing on the patio & looking over the house toward the south, I saw a very bright light, as light as a night light used at a football game, it was approximately The width of my hand above the roof, after staring at it for several min.  I notice it was not moving I let the dog in and poured my coffee I set down and turned the tube on, after some time maybe 30 min.  I noticed it was getting light approximately one hour before sun up, not light but not dark either went out the front door this time and looked up to approximately same location but from the front yard, the light was gone, this is not the first time I have seen, extremely bright lights, sometimes they move and other times they just go out, I know about mercury & Venus, the lights I have seen were not planets the light were way too bright.  As well as too large, as I remember the light was about the size of a full moon.  I know what you’re thinking, but it was not the moon. I’m 71 and know what I saw.  And another thing...this was too low to be the moon. ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly Venus?  PD));35.2906;-95.6476
