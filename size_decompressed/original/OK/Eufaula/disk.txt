UFO sighting southeast Oklahoma;2000-12-29 23:30:00;20 mins;UFO sighting southeast Oklahoma I was driving west on Oklahoma state highway 9 from the city of Eufaula and when I got about 4 miles west I saw three huge orange flashes.  It was in the area where my best friend lives so I pulled of to the side of the road and called him on my cell phone.  I asked him did he see the lights and maybe did he hear a loud noise.  I thought maybe a transformer blew or a small plane had crashed.  It was really bright since we had an ice storm here and everything is really bright when lights hit it.  About the time they (my friend and his family) were going outside, the light headed south at a really high rate of speed and stopped about 10 to 15 miles south and was around 2 or 3 thousand feet in the air.  I had heard that it had been reported about the same time the night before.  It was a disc shaped object that had green, blue, red, and white lights that rotated around it each time in a different color.  I found out that night why people are such criticts about this subject because when you see something like this you say to yourself this is really amazing and who is going to take me seriously!!!  I heard on the Art Bell show that there have been numerious sitings in Oklahoma and Texas in the past 6 months and maybe their is something to this.;35.2906;-95.6476
