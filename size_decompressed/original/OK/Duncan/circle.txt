A;2016-09-08 01:00:00;Continuous;I went outside to smoke a cigarette and just randomly looked up at the sky,I live in the country so just enjoying the piece an quite. As I looked up I noticed what I thought at first was just a star flickering so I continued looking at it an suddenly the round star looking object began moving it several different direction then quickly back to where originally spotted. I was thinking maybe just some sort of drone so looked around up at the sky an noticed same shaped star looking objects at least 12 maybe 15 of the same shape and colors but some are smaller looking then some but would move fairly quick across the sky it's now almost 2am an still going on! Can someone explain what they truly are? If you don't believe me check it out yourself it is truly very weird an I know there's not that many satellites nor drones in almost the same areas! Wtf is going on????;34.5077;-97.9393
