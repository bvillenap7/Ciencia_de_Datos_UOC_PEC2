Massive, rectangular-shaped craft with lights underneath;2007-12-16 00:30:00;5 mins;massive, rectangular-shaped craft with lights underneath On the night above, my friend and I were driving home after a high school basketball game. We saw a bright light off to the Northwest heading straight towards us at a slow rate of speed. I pulled the car over and we just watched. As it got closer, we started to get afraid.  As it flew about 2,000 feet overhead, we could see a large football field-sized rectangular object with white lights underneath.  I turned the car around to follow it and it accelerated at a tremendous rate of speed and was gone within a few seconds towards the Southeast. I have NEVER seen anything like it before or since.  News reports the next day stated others had seen it and that it was a Russian satellite or booster rocket re-entering the atmosphere and crashed in the Gulf of Mexico.  I never believed that explanation. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is flawed.  We have amended the date above.  Possible hoax?  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.
