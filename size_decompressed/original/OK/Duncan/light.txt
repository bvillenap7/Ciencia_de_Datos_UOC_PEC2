While going northbound on Hy 81, stopped at the light by Braum's, a red light slowly descended from approximately 500 feet down to what looked like the ground behind buildings about a block north of Braum's, near the Arvest parking lot.  The light was as brilliant as an LED light, at least the diameter of a stop light.  There was no wind, the sky was clear.   The light descended slowly in a straight trajectory.  It didn't flicker or dim.  There was nothing falling from it.  It was just a brilliant, clear red light that slowly descended from a clear sky and disappeared behind some buildings.  I asked the drive-through clerk if she had seen it, and she had, but didn't have any idea what it was.  I drove past where I estimated it might have landed, but there was nothing out of the ordinary.   I would really like to know what it was, and whether or not anyone else saw it.;34.5077;-97.9393
