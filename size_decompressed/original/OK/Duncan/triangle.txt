Was standing on my porch, smoking a cigarette, when I noticed a red light strobing very slowly, heading in my direction, heading east to west.  I've lived near the small airport here all my life and have never seen anything like this.  I notice it us going along the creek next to my house, but as it gets closer, I notice that I can't hear it and it went right over me very low to the power lines and i could make out the shape it looked like a hang glider but it couldn't be. I tried to take a picture of it when i did my screen on my phone went rainbow like i had held it to a magnet and the camera on it from then on was ruined.  i did not get a picture.  i ran in the house to get my wife when i brought her outside it had gone to far to see have been looking for it every night since I have not seen it again since that night.
