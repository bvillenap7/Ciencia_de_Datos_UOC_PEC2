Large Green Sphere Planet or UFO above the Sun??  YOU DECIDE!!  ((NUFORC Note:  Lens flare.  PD));2015-08-06 19:00:00;1 hour;Large Green Sphere Planet or UFO above the Sun?? YOU DECIDE!! Large Green Sphere above the sun that looked like a planet split in two.  Seemed as if it was two half planets held together with gravity or possibly a ring field like Saturn's.   I took many photos once I saw object and later saw other smaller green spheres closer to ground level.  The previous afternoon I witnessed large triangle shapes flying over my house looked to be 5 or 6 of them.  These were almost completely invisible, but also have photos of this.;35.833;-97.4394000000001
Myself and my husband observed and incredibly straight line of spherical objects in the early morning sky.  ((Starlink satellites));2020-02-25 06:18:00;3-4 minutes;At approximately 6:18 Central standard Time at lake Guthrie in the city of Guthrie Oklahoma the county is Logan County. Myself and my husband observed and incredibly straight line of spherical objects in the early morning sky. These objects were moving in a North Eastward direction. They seem to originate from the southwest portion of the sky they were evenly spaced, white in color(appeared star-like) and flying at a very slow rate of speed in comparison to aircraft. We detected no noise. they seemed to have some sort of formation from the pattern we could see in the sky. Again these objects moved in an incredibly straight line it almost appeared as if they were encircling the Earth! I attempted to film this phenomenon and was unsuccessful.;35.833;-97.4394000000001
