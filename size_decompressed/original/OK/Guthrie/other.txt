I live in a rural home with no neighbors in sight.  Lights caught my eye out of an uncovered window.  The lights were low or eye level from inside of the house looking out.  Stared at it for two to three seconds.  Small white and yellow lights similar to lights on a large truck, however the sequence and shape was wrong for a vehicle.  Almost umbrella like in shape.  It was moving slowly to the south and then moved quickly.   Ran immediately to back porch saw nothing.  Ran to front yard saw nothing.  Gone.;35.833;-97.4394000000001
