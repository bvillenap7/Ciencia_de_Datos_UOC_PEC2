At or about 8 pm Nov. 13 2007 in the backyard of a friend's home I witnessed something that nearly put me on the ground in fear.  A pair of huge and extreemly lighted craft, one turning from south to east, the other from north to west and proceeded to fly directly at me. it was the clasic saucer shape but the botom apeared squareed of like a match box hanging under it.  a small light on the under side of that boxed portion and a row of 5-6 very bright lights above that rectangle boxed underside. above the box portion appeared another longer thinner under side that was rounded at the ends like a popsickle stick snapped in two horisontaly. it would be like a match box with this half pop stick on top then the underside of the suacer on top of that. Then a domed portion on top of the saucer. As it flew over me at about 400 ft. it was a triangle wing sillouette. Low near silent rumble with 5-6 round enginge ports at the rear glowed orange that resembled the front row of the crafts brite bank of lights, and lights on each delta tip.  This craft would appear suacer shape from any direction of observation eccept directly overhead. it looked the same going away as coming towords me. very big delta shape. I had my camera phone in my hand but was so overwhelmed I wasn't thinking about real pics but was taking a mental pic. It was an incredible experience I will never foget.;35.833;-97.4394000000001
