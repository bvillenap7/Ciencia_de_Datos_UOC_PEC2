It was the Fouth of July 2002 and we where having a picnic with family friends, a lot of family. We were in Henryetta, Oklahoma in the country shooting off fireworks. We all looked up and the sky was full of stars moving in circles, and shooting from side to side, darting across the sky. Crazy! They would change direction in a moment. There where lots of them (don't know how many) everywhere. All of us just stood there watching. It was as thought they were giving us a 4 of July show. I really believe they where.  It's funny that this happened, because my husband didn't believe in UFO'S and use to laugh at me because I told him I had seen one before. Well he believes now!  The first time was about 3 years before.   Both sightings were so high they just looked like stars. My old boy friend and I decide we were going to go watch for UFO's one night. We we saw them! The first one I ever saw they were flying paralell to eachother going East. They were doing barrel rolls in the sky.... It was fantastic looking. Then both stopped. One left a star then they both went opposite directions, one North and one South.......fast!! Well that was my first time.  Anyway just always wanted to tell my story to someone. Are there groups that just go out looking for UFOS to see at night? Just curious..((name deleted))..in .oklahoma;35.4669;-96.0129
