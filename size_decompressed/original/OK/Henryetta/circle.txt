Saw a bright orb looking star and it exploded.;2014-08-28 19:45:00;3 minutes;Saw a bright orb looking star and it exploded. Myself and two others were sitting on a hilltop watching the sun set in the western Oklahoma sky about 7:45pm.  Right above the cloud line appeared a ball of light, the size of a star but much brighter and closer, we thought maybe it could be the space station going by. The light stayed in the same spot for about two minutes then 2 smaller orb looking shapes appeared directly under it. The bright light began to get very dim as if it was moving away. We thought it was gone then out of nowhere the bright orb exploded as if it hit something, there was a large ball of fire in the sky, it happened so fast. Right after, it left what looked like a cloud of smoke. The pictures enclosed are immediately after it exploded.
