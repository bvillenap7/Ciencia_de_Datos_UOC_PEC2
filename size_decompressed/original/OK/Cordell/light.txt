Blue and red light orb falling from sky, then rising again.;2012-11-19 20:00:00;5-6 minutes;Blue and red light orb falling from sky, then rising again. Only minutes ago, I was sitting in my truck in line at a convenience store drive through.  I was on the phone with my husband also.  I was looking ahead at a church building across the ways and a BRIGHT red and blue light was falling from the sky in which looked like the empty lot next to it.  Once I receieved my items I drove in the direction of the light.  I could see nothing.  One block down on the opposite side of the street I see the light going back up!  I hurriedly found a place to park and am telling my husband what I am witnessing.  He tells me that he witnessed something similar a week ago today on his evening drive home.  I park in an empty lot and watch the sky.  I could see the craft of some sort that was reflecting light moving slowly into the distance.  It stopped, almost motionless with no lights on for about a minute.  Then moved to the west slowly getting brighter the further away and smaller it got. It then turned and headed back into the direction of town.  I then noticed at least 3 smaller ones all moving in the same pattern but in different locations/depths of the sky. They were not always lit up, they would go completely black but still reflected light a bit so I could see them.  I have never before witnessed anything of this sort.;35.2804;-98.9474
