Delta shaped lights hovering over areas of Bigfoot activity.;2012-03-31 00:00:00;30 minutes;Delta shaped lights hovering over areas of Bigfoot activity. I and two other researchers were exploring a heavily wooded area with a known history of Bigfoot activity.  After dark, we began using Gen 1, Gen 3 and FLIR night vision equipment.  We had approximately a 10 foot figure approach to within 75 yards of us caught on the FLIR scope.  We obtained night vision video of this subject that appeared to be female. During this time, I noticed about 6 delta shaped lights hovering above the trees.  They had lights changing colors from white, to red, to blue, to green at different times.  When I pointed this out to the other two researchers, the lights seemed to dodge behind the trees to avoid being seen. Later, I was reviewing my Gen 1 night vision videos and found a clip of these short, bubble headed subjects peering over our four wheelers.  They look freaky in the video and nothing like a Bigfoot, for which I do have video of on other dates and times. My wife and her cousin have been with me when they also saw these lights in the sky hovering over Bigfoot activity areas. Iâ€™m not trying to sensationalize anything, just relating the truth of things I have witnessed and documented.;34.3416;-96.1384
