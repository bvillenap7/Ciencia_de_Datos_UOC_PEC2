I was under a barn roof not in view but after it caught my eye and I watched it curiously I decided to video it with my iPhone.  As soon as I stepped out from under the roof and I became visible and the light from my iPhone could be seen the object moved to the north at a high rate of speed and the light went out.  It just vanished into the dark sky..;35.4846;-97.1726
