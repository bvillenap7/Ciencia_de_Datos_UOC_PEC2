ALTHOUGH THERE WERE MILITARY MANUVERES WITH DIFFERENT TYPES OF HELECOPTORS PRACTICED IN THE AREA, THEY WERE ALWAYS DONE DURING THE DAY, SO I WONDERED WHAT THE LIGHT WAS. AS WE WATCHED, IT SLOWLY APPROACHED. WHAT SEEMED UNUSUAL WAS THAT IT WAS MOVING SO SLOWLY, AND WAS TO LOW TO THE GROUND TO BE A LARGE AIRCRAFT. I GOT MY BINOCULARS OUT AND WE BEGAN TO WATCH AS IT GOT CLOSER. AT IT'S CLOSEST POINT IT APPEARED TO BE ABOUT AS LARGE AS A CIGARETTE HELD AT ARMS LENGTH, AND SINCE THERE WAS A FULL MOON, WE WERE ABLE TO SEE IN DETAIL. IT WAS NOT A HELECOPTOR. IT LOOKED LIKE THE WASINGTON MONUMENT SET ATOP A PYRAMID FLYING, OR HOVERING HORIZONTAL TO THE GROUND. IT HAD A BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT AT THE TIP, AND THREE RED AND WHITE LIGHTS AT THE BASE, AND THESE WERE BLINKING ON AND OFF IN A CIRCULAR PATTERN. WE WERE ABLE TO VIEW THIS OBJECT IN DETAIL FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES AS IT SLOWLY MOVED ACROSS THE SKY. THE OBJECT WAS SOLID AND THERE WERE NO OTHER LIGHTS. WE COULD SEE THE STRAIGHT EDGES HIGHLIGHTED IN THE MOONLIGHT WITH THE BOTTOM SIDES IN SHADOWS. WE BOTH AGREED THAT IT WAS NOT CONVENTIONAL, AND THAT IT DID IN FACT LOOK LIKE THE WASHINGTON MONUMENT FLYING ON IT'S SIDE. WE CALLED THE POLICE TO SEE IF ANYBODY ELSE HAD SEEN ANYTHING UNUSUAL, BUT NOTHING ELSE HAD BEEN REPORTED, AND WE NEVER HEARD ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT IT. I HAVE TOLD A FEW FRIENDS, BUT BECAUSE OF THE SKECTICISM I'VE NOT SPOKEN ABOUT IT VERY MUCH. HOWEVER, I KNOW WHAT I SAW, AND IT WAS NOTHING LIKE ANYTHING I HAVE EVER SEEN.
