Large, very bright orange light seen close in Wilburton, OK.;2012-08-13 22:00:00;30 seconds;Large, very bright orange light seen close in Wilburton, OK.  My Girlfriend and I were walking from the Choctaw Travel Plaza to her house, which is across the road. I noticed a very bright orange light, which I quickly motioned too. We observed the light together. We watched the orange light for a few seconds, then the large orange light began moving. It moved up and down quickly, bobbing rather. It moved East, and continued at a fast speed. We watched it until it crossed over the railroad by the Choctaw parking-lot, next to the power-relay-station. We quickly made our way across the road, I was able to see the back of the orange light. The bottom of the light appeared to have a reddish tan,, exactly like a gas-heater on low. We watched it until we were unable to see it, anymore.  The light from the post in the parking-lot was too bright, and made it difficult for us to see it as it flew East. My Girlfriend says that there was a silver aurora around the bright orange light, something I also noticed. The orange light was considerably large, and did not emit any sounds. It couldn't have been more than two blocks away from where we were standing. I believe it was right over the power-station that you see from the Choctaw Parking-lot. It was very close, and moved in such a way that it couldn't have been any aircraft of civilian origin. I have never seen anything like it, and neither has my Girlfriend.;34.9101;-95.3363
