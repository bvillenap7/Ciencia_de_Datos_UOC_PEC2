close stationary cluster of lights strobes,solid,and beams,with No solid object noted.;2001-12-01 21:30:00;3-5mins;close stationary cluster of lights strobes,solid,and beams,with No solid object noted. We were travelling west on I44,wife was driving and woke me to view lights in sky to the northwest of us. They seemed to be very close,guessing less than a mile. They appeared to be stationary with large spot or floodlight shining from center of cluster to the left or west.The lights gave the appearance of different size tails but were definitely not tails, they were light beams, as landing lights on an aircraft. The scene was definitely not a returning piece of space junk.It didn't appeal to me to be anything but some sort of a military manuever.Looked like an area of refueling helicopters. We didn't stop moving,and it appeared that the lights were still in the sky and we were passing them. From the passenger seat of our rig,I counted out loud ,6or7 red strobe lights,along with an indeterminate number of green,white and orange lights in no particular pattern.We were moving about 70 mph,and they were in sight about 4 mins. from 30deg.in front to about 15 deg behind us and to the right. My wife saw them about 30  sec longer than I did.At arms length,they appeared to be about 12 to 14in length,and about 7 to 9 high.They appeared close because of the clarity of the strobes and we seemed to be passing them and the pattern appeared to change noticeably in perspective.  Another driver getting to OK city about 10 mins behind us told of seeing the scene accelerate fantastically ,but we saw no such movement.Must have happened after we passed by. ((NUFORC Note:  Probably a space debris re-entry.  Please see other reports.  PD)) ((UPDATE SUBMITTED 01DE02 BY ORIGINAL WITNESS)) update on OK. sighting 12/01 this is an update to the above sighting --  As there seemed to be no craft involved, just a series of mismatched lights, there have been several possibilities as to just what we saw//   ==        About the first of Nov. we were travelling north on the turnpike in OK, just north of Tulsa,around dusk, and crossing the navigation channel, I looked west along the channel and saw anchored on the north shore a large barge. It had misc. red,green and strobe lights on it and TWO large spot lights mounted on a mast,about 1/3 the way along the craft. the spots were different sizes and mounted above each other but both facing straight ahead.   This scene,if reproduced as a hologram and projected skyward, would have duplicated exactly what we saw in Dec.  It would explain how the object could have moved at a fantastic rate,as was told by another witness, just by turning the 'projector'from side to side, and then shutting off the power, to make it disappear altogether. This explanation , for me,  at least gives me a sense of possibility.  This setup could be used by anyone ( government included) to create at least a diversion that could be  moved even electronically,from place to place to be seen by as many different people as the perpetrator wished. ((END)) ((NUFORC NOTE:  Please see other reports for this date.  We believe the lights observed were fragments of a re-entering Russian missile hull.  Probably not a holographic projection, we believe.  PD));35.677;-97.0634
