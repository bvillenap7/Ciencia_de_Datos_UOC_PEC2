free falling light in central Oklahoma;2007-10-30 21:00:00;3 minutes;free falling light in central Oklahoma In Holdenville oklahoma at my parents’ farm at around 8:45 pm on 10/30/07 I was watching a single light travel south to north-which is typical of planes going into Tulsa from Dallas, but as I watched the light started to fall out of the sky really fast, and then lit up the whole sky for a few seconds. I thought maybe it was a satellite burning up falling to earth, but then it just started to move north again like nothing had happened. I told my brother about this, and he said, “ oh I have seen that thing before” that’s all.;35.0818;-96.3785
