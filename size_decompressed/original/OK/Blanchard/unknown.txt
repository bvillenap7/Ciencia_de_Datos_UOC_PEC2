Strange large bright lights seen in sky over Blanchard, OK March 18th.;2005-03-18 20:00:00;5 minutes;Strange large bright lights seen in sky over Blanchard, OK March 18th. It was dark out so they didn't see the shape but they saw 3 huge bright lights and it was traveling from the southeast to the north at a slow speed. After it passed they felt this big gust of wind where there had been calm before it. The kids ages 6,8,10,&11 were on the patio in the dark playing when they saw it. They all came in the house screaming telling us what they had seen and I stepped outside the house and felt the wind. I am their grandmother and I made them all sit down and sit so they couldn't see each other and had them draw on a piece of paper what they had seen before they had a chance to talk it over between them. Their drawings were eerily similar.;35.1192;-97.6401
