On the right the sky lit up with a bright yellow/orange and all of a sudden what looked like a saucer shot up from the ground and within seconds, it disappeared into the dark part of the sky and the bright light went away instantly.   There were plenty of cars behind me that I know had to see the exact sighting!! ((NUFORC Note:  We confirmed via telephone the time of the sighting.  The party we spoke with via telephone seemed to us to be quite sober minded and sincere.  PD));34.7713;-98.4068
