UFO near Elgin, Oklahoma;2020-07-30 05:12:00;15 seconds;UFO near Elgin, Oklahoma Ok, I saw something yesterday morning on July 30th at approximately 5:12 A.M. that I can't explain. I'm a veteran of the U.S. Army and I believe I saw a UFO. I'm 100% convinced. This happened at 5:12AM about 5 miles northeast of Elgin, Oklahoma which happens to be near Ft. Sill and nearby BAE Systems which contracts through the D.O.D. So there I was driving to work and off to my right was a house and some trees.  All of a sudden a bright light appeared over this house and began flickering randomly as if someone bottled up a lightning storm.  I can't explain it.  At first I thought it was from lightning because there was a lightning storm on the northern border of Oklahoma well over 150 miles away.  Anyways the light then turned solid and it immediately moved over by a large tree, circled around the tree.  Then it moved up into the air about 20 feet and then move away from the tree about another 20 feet and came to a complete stop.  Then it immediately shot straight up into the air. It was small, about the size of a Chevrolet Spark to give an idea of the size.  It was circular like the shape of a pill and it was metallic.  Feel free to contact me for any questions about my encounter.;34.7713;-98.4068
