At 6:25 on my way to work, I was driving west. There were storms to the North East, and a few clouds were in the western skies.   There was an oval, bright light that came into view flying North To South in a downward angle.  I first thought it was a falling star, but realized it was bigger, and brighter.  It was moving pretty fast, and was in the air for 20 to 25 seconds before it was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
