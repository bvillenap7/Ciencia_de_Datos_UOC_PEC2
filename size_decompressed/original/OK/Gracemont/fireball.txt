It would change from dim to bright. The color was a dull yellow. It was a clear night. Tried to report this after observing, but server was down for a long time. I took picture's of it. I called my wife and mother-in-law outside, they observed the same thing. No sound could be heard from it.;35.1841;-98.2818
