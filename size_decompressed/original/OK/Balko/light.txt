Turned orange and headed south I followed Seen a red light thought was a plane heading South twhile traveling through the Oklahoma panhandle.  We were about 2 miles East of Balko on hwy 412.  The red light came to a complete stop turned blue hovered for about 3 mins. Then it turned orange and turned around and headed south.  I turned around and followed down a dirt road then it stopped and I pulled over got my binoculars and watched it for about 10 mins I could see a object behind the light but couldn't tell the shape.  It took off and headed south.  Would like to know if anybody else seen this and what you might think it was.;36.596;-100.7093
