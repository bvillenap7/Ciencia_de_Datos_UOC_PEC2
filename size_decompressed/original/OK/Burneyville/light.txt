wobbly yellowish bright light passed overhead from southwest horizon to northeast horizon.  ((NUFORC Note:  ISS overflight.  PD));2006-04-21 21:10:00;approx1min.;wobbly yellowish bright light passed overhead from southwest horizon to northeast horizon in a little less than a min.object was silent. Object was observed on a clear starlit night.No visible moon in night sky.Object appeared as a bright yellowish light seen first in the southwest moving at a steady rate of speed toward the northeast.Our location was on a ranch which borders route 35.A small twin-engined jet crossed the object's path just before we lost sight of the object in the northeast horizon.The jet had two red lights on each wing as well as a strobe light.The object traveled in a wobbly yet straight path from southwest to northeast.I cannot say what the object's rate of speed was, but I can tell you it took roughly one minute for it to cross the entire sky.The object was silent and no other aircraft were observed from sundown till 11 pm(at which point I retired)except for the previously mentioned jet. Did anyone out there witness this object as well? ((NUFORC Note:  International Space Station visible from this location at 21:17 hrs. on this date.
