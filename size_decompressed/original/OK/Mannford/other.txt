I got up to let my elderly dog outside to relieve herself.  I sat on the porch and was gazing up to the stars.  I saw what could be described as a game!!  There were seven objects east of my home which looked like where firing upon each other.  I sat and watched for what seemed like a very long time.  There was a reddish object to my left with 3 objects in the middle trying to deflect the shots, and a blueish object to my right.  It seemed like a referee was north and south.  At times, it appeared as if the red was firing at the blue and the 3 lights in the middle were trying to block. Also, at times there were objects that appeared to come from the other 7 objects, or trails of light.  I went inside and woke my spouse and told what I saw.  My spouse and my daughter came out and witness the exact same thing.  I have been a skeptic.  9-2-01.  Too cloudy to observe.  Was hoping to clarify what was seen as fact or fiction.;36.0945;-96.3602
