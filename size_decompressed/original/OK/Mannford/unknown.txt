Reddish-orange orbs hovering, them disappearing in the night sky;2010-08-28 22:20:00;5 Minutes;Reddish-orange orbs hovering, them disappearing in the night sky Starting at approximately 10:20 pm I observed 3 reddish-orange blobs or orbs that appeared to be hovering or moving slowly at about an angle of 15° - 20° in the sky, directly south of Mannford Oklahoma. After watching them for about 1 minute and unable to determine what they might be, I went inside and got my son and daughter-in-law to see if they could determine what the objects were. Shortly after they came outside, we also noticed a fourth object of the same type. From our vantage point looking directly south of our location, the three of us watched them move across the sky in a west to northwest path without any hint of sound or noise to be heard at all, and they appeared to be gaining in elevation. My son attempted to capture a video (that didn't work), so at 10:22 pm he finally successfully took a photo of one of the objects using his cell phone. Each one of the objects, in turn, disappeared in the approximate same position or location in the sky, roughly at an angle of around 35°-40° parallel from ground level and roughly 35° to 45° farther west of the position that I first noticed them. In total, we watched them for about 5 minutes before they disappeared in the night sky.;36.0945;-96.3602
