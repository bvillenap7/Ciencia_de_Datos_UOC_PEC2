WHILE ME AND A FRIEND WERE FISHING ON A LAKE WE SAW AN OBJECT IT WAS VERY SCARY.;2005-11-22 19:45:00;25 MINUTES;WHILE ME AND A FRIEND WERE FISHING ON A LAKE WE SAW AN OBJECT IT WAS VERY SCARY. Me and a friend that is one of my neighbors were fishing out on a nearby lake. We had our chairs and our fishing poles. And we sat down and fished awhile. And we were looking up and saw this object. It was round and wide on the top and the sides of it got narrower going to the bottom. It was round and narrow on the bottom and wider going to the top of the object. It looked like a top. It was orange lighted with red vertical lines all around the sides. It had a blue light in the middle of the top and a blue light in the middle of the bottom. It was very scary and scared both of us. I've never been so scared. So we got our fishing poles and chairs and went back to the car. We looked back at the lake and still saw the object. The object made no sound. Then it was gone and it was no where in sight. This happened on November 22, 2005 on a Tuesday night at 7:45 P.M. So after we left the lake we took our fishing poles and dropped them off at our houses. And we got a motel room. We stayed at the HOLIDAY INN in Oklahoma City on South Meridian. And we got a bite to eat. And in the motel room we talked for hours about our scary experience while we were fishing on the lake.;35.6423374100721;-97.4807938848921
3 motionless objects w/ blinking lights;2005-12-01 22:00:00;1 1/2+ hours;3 motionless objects w/ blinking lights My husband was on the phone with a friend of ours who lives just down the street from us in our neighborhood.  He and his wife had spotted objects in the sky and asked my husband if we had seen them/been watching them.  My husband went outside to see them then came back inside, woke me up and had me go out and look at them.  There were 3 distant objects (that I could see) in the Eastern sky.  They appeared not to be moving at all.  They were brighter than stars and twinkling/blinking.  Had they been moving I would have thought they were airplanes or helicopters or something.  But what struck us all was that they appeared to be motionless but just as bright if not brighter than an airplane or such.  When we first looked at them there were two other aircrafts in the air that were moving so it was easy to tell the difference between and airplane/helicopter and what we were seeing, which were seemingly motionless. I decided to use my husband's binoculars to see if I could get a better view of what they were.  I looked at each one and they each had the same characteristics.  It was FREEZING outside so it was hard for me to stand still and my shaking from the cold made my vision a bit blurry at times through the binoculars.  I couldn't see an object per say, but each object had bright, blinking lights (red, green, white, blue, etc.) that appeared to blink very quickly and seemed to change the pattern of their blinking/lighting-up.  With the binoculars, I could clearly see the lights.  The lights lit up clearly in circles but it was difficult for me to see their patterns as I was shaking from the cold and the patterns that the lights lit up in seemed to change very quickly.  We came to the conclusion that they were satellites since we know very little about this type of thing, but after looking into sattelites on the internet have determined that not to be the case.  We are all completely stumped at what we saw.  But these objects didn't appear to move a bit for at least an hour and a half (till we finally went to bed).  There has been no mention of it on the news and am very curious for an explanation of what we saw.;35.6423374100721;-97.4807938848921
Two UFO's appear within ten minutes of each other.;2010-03-25 23:00:00;10:55 - 11:05 PM;Two UFO's appear within ten minutes of each other. Around approximately 10:55pm 3/25/2010, Spotted a UFO in Edmond, Oklahoma. It appeared suddenly in the night sky, however it soon dissapeared after about 2-3 seconds. Almost 90% sure it wasn’t a shooting star since I have witnessed many shooting stars in my life. Approximately 5-10 minutes later, another aircraft very brighty at slow speeds appeared very closely to where I saw the first sighting. The second aircraft however was a very bright light and had one other flashing white light beside it. No other colors could be seen besides the white light flashing beside it. Could what I have seen been two UFO’s? Or, could the second aircraft be pinned onto a registered aircraft? No shape could be reconized due the the fact it was very dark.;35.6423374100721;-97.4807938848921

Typically I see them comin;2015-01-19 21:20:00;30;I was taking a spa, when I looked in the east and seen at first lights that I thought were an jet air plane.  Typically I see them coming into Oklahoma City all the time to land but this time the lights were higher than normal and appeared stationary.   Then they went North stopped then went straight up 90 degrees.  The speed seemed beyond what any known aircraft could do for the given height in the sky.  I estimate that the craft was at normal jet passenger traveling elevation of 10,000 to 20,000 feet.   Then the craft went rapidly to the south and descended at an extremely fast pace.  I would lose it in the light overcast clouds and then it would reappear in the East at a point I first noticed it.  Its movements were very quick but directional, meaning a straight line.  You could follow it with the naked eye but were amazed at the speed.  From the east it went southwest and I would lose it in the clouds only to find it again in the east.   Again, I would observe it going from the east to the northwest appear to stop and then takeoff at a rapid speed to the east.  This went on for about 30 minutes.   The object had 3 red lights that were in a V-type formation.  Once only once I saw a whit light.  It was not flashing.   When it moved the 3 red lights didn’t follow the v path of the lights.  The object did not make any audible sound.;35.6423374100721;-97.4807938848921
Two extremely bright lights appear quickly high in the sky and disappear as fast.;2020-12-06 19:00:00;45 seconds;Two extremely bright lights appear quickly high in the sky and disappear as fast. Was standing outside in backyard with the dog.  Looked up in the sky, south and west of Mars, I saw two positions that at first I thought were distant stars. Then the brightness of them increased in intensity and they were extremely bright and white, no blinking or other colors. After fifteen or twenty seconds, they began to fade and as they were fading, they to go up and away, out of sight as fast as they appeared.;35.6423374100721;-97.4807938848921
