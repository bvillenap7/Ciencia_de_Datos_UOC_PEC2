glowing red lights speeding across the sky;2001-05-12 23:00:00;5 sec;glowing red lights speeding across the sky My husband and I were standing outside looking at stars and sattelites. We were talking when all of a sudden we saw a weird looking light in the sky. It was a soft glowing orangish red color. It was moving very fast and made no noise at all. We aren't sure if it was just one or if there was two of them as there was one light behind the other. It was very strange to say the least!! I know that I have never seen anything like that before in my life and I have always enjoyed watching the stars.;35.6423374100721;-97.4807938848921

Red and Green Lights over Edmond, Ok.;2012-05-12 22:00:00;15 minutes;Red and Green Lights over Edmond, Ok. The object appeared to change colors from green to red and back again.  It traveled in a semi-circle pattern that would rise and fall in the distant sky.  I watched it for at least 15 minutes, going inside on several occasions to get my wife, but she was in the shower.  I also tried filming it with my Iphone, but it did not show up.  The object appeared to be many miles away from me but, I was amazed at the speed that it rose and dropped and how fluid it was.;35.6423374100721;-97.4807938848921
Underwater Light appeared shot up out of a lake and hovered then disappeared.;2013-08-24 01:00:00;5 minutes;Underwater Light appeared shot up out of a lake and hovered then disappeared 	This past saturday night I was at Lake Arcadia around 12:30-1:00 in the morning fishing for catfish.  I was fishing out of this old Juan boat and there was absolutely no one else on the water.  The only other people that I saw out there that evening was a group of 12 to 15 people around a fire on a campsite on opposite side of the like.  Believe me, you could tell and hear that they were there.  However there was no one at that site for a while before the sighting. 	I was getting ready to leave when about 60 to 75 yards behind me, a giant bright and glowing light appeared under the lakes surface.  It was fairly large and had a light green color to it with a rhythmic flashing of red and blue lights. 	Then the light began moving from western side of the lakes shore to the  eastern side and back to the other side a couple of times then it stopped almost near the center of the lake.  At that moment, it grew brighter and slightly larger then shot straight up in the air and into the sky and seemingly disappeared for a couple of seconds and reappered hovering right over the campsite that I mentioned earlier and disappeared again.  Then reappeared again maybe a minute later and shot up into the sky and went out of sight and I never saw it again. 	I drove my boat over to the site where the craft was hovering over as fast as I could get there.  However, I did not recognize anything out of the ordinary.  Just a white ford truck with several bags of trash in the bed and a couple other sitting beside it.  I did not see any one by the truck or in the immediate area.;35.6423374100721;-97.4807938848921
