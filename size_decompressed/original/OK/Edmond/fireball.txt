Red and orange pulsing light flying in odd way.;2015-08-25 20:00:00;2 minutes;Red and orange pulsing light flying in odd way Was sitting outside and it was almost completely dark outside.  Saw a red and orange light flying in the sky and the light.  Was pulsing dimmer and brighter.   It was flying fairly slow, then dipped down and started flying faster.  It disappeared behind some trees where I couldn't see anymore.  Then, 30 seconds later, another red and orange object appeared, going another direction. And appeared to stop completely in the air, then start again going in a swerved path.  I do have a video.;35.6423374100721;-97.4807938848921
