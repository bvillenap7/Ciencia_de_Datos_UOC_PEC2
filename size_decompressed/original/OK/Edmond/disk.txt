daylight sighting. saucer. up close and personal;1997-06-15 14:00:00;2 -3 minutes;daylight sighting. saucer. up close and personal I was leaving my girlfriend's house to go home. I exited her house through the garage. My motorcycle was sitting in the driveway and I was approaching it to get on it and start it up. It was then I noticed a strange object in the sky. At first I mainly saw lights. Her house sat on the top of a hill. The object was not any more than a few hundred feet off of the ground. the area of the ground it was hovering over was down hill from me. It slowly moved closer to my location making no noise. I could then make out the shape. It was a saucer shaped object that was taller in the middle. classic flying saucer shape. Now, in the middle of the disk area on the side there where lights of a few different colors: red white green yellow and a brownish red. The colors seemed to alternate as it hovered there. I remember just standing there frozen staring at this thing. when it started to turn at an angle almost perpindicular to the ground but not quite perfectly perpendicular. as it moved to this angle there was a crude mechanical sound coming from it. it sounded alot like an espresso machine when it is pumping water through the coffee. once it was at the terminal point of its turn it was once again silent. then, no kidding, it emitted a beam of yellowish light onto the ground. at this point it was probably 50 feet in front of me. then the light stopped and the mechanical sound started again. As the sound was going it returned to a parallel position in respect to the ground. It hovered there for a little less than a minute then suddenley there was a sound that sounded like a bottle rocket when it takes off as it shot straight up into the air. It went upward so quickly that I only saw it for a split second. It left so quickly that I bareley saw it. so I looked around and noticed that about 15 feet away the neighbor, an older woman about my girlfriend's mom's age, was working in her garden and she was still staring in the direction of the very strange and very scary sight. She looked at me and said, that was probably a helicopter. I looked away from her, than just said, yeah. I got on my motorcycle, started it, and rode home. yep, most people think I'm crazy when I tell them about it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.

ufo chase with 3 air planes.;2007-08-07 23:03:00;2 seconds;ufo chase with 3 air planes. i noticed in the sky 3 air craft traveling south. then to the left of them, i noticed a flash of light as something disk shaped skid across the night sky, then winked out. i noticed a red light on it as it was traveling. the 3 air craft flew over head shortly after the UFO disappeared. but the most noticeable thing about it was how i felt afterwards. it was a weird feeling before, during, and after. i still feel really weird about it.;35.6423374100721;-97.4807938848921
