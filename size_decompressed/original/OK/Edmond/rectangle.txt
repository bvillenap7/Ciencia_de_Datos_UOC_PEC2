Black angular UFO shaped object near Old North Tower, University of Central Oklahoma, Edmond;2014-10-29 18:50:00;1 minute;Black angular UFO shaped object near Old North Tower, University of Central Oklahoma, Edmond I arrived for my 19:30 evening class at UCO very early at 18:45 - Parked in the metered parking area, looked for coins for the meter, since I didn't have much I decided to walk around near the car and put the coins in the meter closer to class time.  The sun was setting in the west and the sunlight pinkish and dimming quickly I turned around and Old North was lighted so beautifully I decided to take a photo, never satisfied with the layout of the first photo I took a second photo with better composition.   On 11/3 upon reviewing my photos I noticed the object in both photos.  I sent the photos to a friend for further analysis and we were unable to clearly identify a logical explanation.  The object is dark/black and appears angular but not rectangle or triangle - like a boxy UFO shape.;35.6423374100721;-97.4807938848921
