Bright light traversed night sky then sped off at extreme speed.  ((anonymous report));1981-05-25 21:30:00;1 minute;Bright light traversed night sky then sped off at extreme speed. My “UFO” Story I hesitate to call what I saw a UFO as it was just a bright light, but it was unidentified, it did fly and it was some sort of object. This event occurred the summer of 1981 near the end of May.  I was at an end-of-school party after my senior year.  (To clarify, as a teetotaler I was in no way impaired.)  I and a small group of people were sitting out on an uncovered patio about 75 feet from the main house making small talk and enjoying the quiet sounds of the summer night.  It was full-on dark and the moon was either low to the horizon or waning because I do not recall seeing it.  The house on the north side of town was far enough out to be removed from any light pollution providing an amazing view of a cloudless, star-filled night sky. I was in a lawn chair facing east.  Most of the group walked back to the house while I and one other person remained.  There was no wind that night, and the house was far enough away, so except for the crickets, frogs and other subtle noises, it was very quiet.  We noticed a bright light slowly moving up from the southern horizon.  My first thought was that it was just a ‘rising’ star but it continued on its straight path north so we thought perhaps it was a satellite and commented that it was cool to have seen one…a first for me.  The bright light, the size of a very bright star continued on its course straight north, moving fast enough to be easily picked out in the vast field of stars.  In about 30 seconds it moved steadily to the north horizon and briefly stopped only to reverse course!  This really got our attention because satellites don’t do this!  We determined that it could not be a high flying plane or helicopter with a single bright light, because it didn’t block ! out any of the numerous stars that were visible and if it had been a plane the body of the plane would have blocked them out it also made not even the faintest noise or vibration.  We watched as it returned at the same steady speed until it reached a point directly overhead, paused momentarily and sped off to the east, disappearing in the blink of an eye. We both sat for a moment then looked at each other and said, ‘Did you see that?’  We both did, and in silent agreement and understanding that we likely wouldn’t be believed never again said a word about it. I thought I’d share my story here in the event any others might have seen it as I’ve never forgotten this vivid memory and have also never shared it publicly.

I was outside with my dogs when I saw what looked like a shooting star. I noticed it start on the East horizone line and make it way to the West horizone line. I thought to myself how amazing it was that it didn't fade away and thats when I noticed the head of the light was shaped in a perfect triangle. Just before the light was covered by my nieghbors tree it faintly flashed and completely disappeared, Light and light tail.;35.6423374100721;-97.4807938848921
Two lights traveling extremely fast starting northeast of Edmond.;2009-07-08 23:30:00;10-15 seconds;Two lights traveling extremely fast starting northeast of Edmond. Initially what appeared to be one light turned into two. Started northeast of Edmond and traveled South toward OKC, then turned southwest, then turned west until out of our line of sight.  These lights covered 50 miles in approx 10-15 seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));35.6423374100721;-97.4807938848921
Stars foating off and shooting away;2011-07-27 11:45:00;5-6 seconds;Stars foating off and shooting away ok as a person who goes out and smokes every night i always star at the night sky looking at stars and what not, well yesterday i was looking up and after seeing a couple of green shooting stars i start to stare around and all of a sudden a star was moving very slowly and curving threw the sky until a bug flew in my face and went to look back and could not find it. so i go back in about an hour or two later i go out again and smoke a cig and after 2 minutes i see another shooting star then another tiny bright star starts to move it curves slowly threw the sky for maybe 7 seconds then shoots off at lightning speed and disappears. scary shit changed my life.

Red and Green lights;2012-05-12 22:40:00;4 minutes;Red and Green lights Witnessed a light that was first red then green in the Northeastern sky of Edmond OK, the craft was flying in circular patterns that went from the middle of the sky to below the horizon.    This light was moving at moderate speed for sight but at that distance it must of traveling very quickly to make the descents and the ascents that it was making.;35.6423374100721;-97.4807938848921
White bright light ascending at immense rate.;2014-06-21 22:20:00;10 seconds;White bright light ascending at immense rate. Went outside for some fresh air. I always look straight up to the night sky as this was an exceptionally clear night when I spotted an unusually bright light seen to the East/SE.  This was brighter than the North Star, but drifting to the SE. No navigational lights were observed-extremely bright light larger than the North Star. After observing for about 5 seconds, the object changed in scale and quality as if it was ascending(becoming smaller).  The bright light transitioned in to a smaller point turning red. The observation ended when what was left of the object took a dramatic change in direction.  It had appeared to ascend sharply in to the sky like a J shape hooking in to space with very great speed.  A small very faint light trail of it's trajectory was left for a fraction of a second during these last moments. The speed was the most fantastic characteristic of the observation.;35.6423374100721;-97.4807938848921
BRIGHT white, circular, hovering light, surrounded by smaller lights.;2015-01-29 19:40:00;Continuous;BRIGHT white, circular, hovering light, surrounded by smaller lights Driving down Penn Ave., between 206 and 220, saw a circular, BRIGHT light.  The bright light was surrounded by other smaller lights.   The white light was very large and had about the intensity of a halogen or LED lightbulb.  The smaller lights were red and green.   I know planes have red and green lights, but there were multiple on this thing.  The strangest part was, it was completely still and simply hovered way above the power lines.   Strangest thing I've seen in my life.;35.6423374100721;-97.4807938848921
Gold streak of light seen at night, stagnant and growing thicker before disappearing.;2017-09-24 20:15:00;45 seconds;Gold streak of light seen at night, stagnant and growing thicker before disappearing. At first, I thought I was seeing a small part of a thin crescent moon, as it was a cloudy night. However, the light grew gradually and I realized it couldn't be the moon.   The light was sort of gold colored.  I feel like I remember seeing it shimmer, but I might be wrong.   It didn't appear to be moving across the sky, or if it was, it was very slow or possibly moving towards me.   It lasted about 45-60 seconds until I looked away and it was gone.;35.6423374100721;-97.4807938848921
