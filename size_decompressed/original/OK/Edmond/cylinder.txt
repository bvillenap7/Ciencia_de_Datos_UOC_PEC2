Crash site is known as Cherry Farm Edmond Oklahoma 1998;1998-09-15 12:00:00;1 minute;Crash site is known as Cherry Farm Edmond Oklahoma 1998 While drinking a cup of coffee on my front lawn and listening to the band of our local junior college a half mile north of my house  I suddenly saw a small four to five foot cylinder like object flying very very slowly about 25 feet off the ground coming north to south between my house and my next door neighbor.  It was silent.  It slowed to a stop, it had a small cockpit on the south top side, I noticed light smoke inside the cockpit,it then started moving again and appeared to be having trouble, it headed down directly into the woods and disappeared from my view, it either landed or crashed into the area across the street known as the Cherry Farm, a neighbor and myself did a light search but never found it, this is private property and in my opinion it is still there. I have never talked about it because its hard to believe, I would be more than happy to have my neighbor talk to you and confirm this account.;35.6423374100721;-97.4807938848921
Skinny cylinder object moved through sky like a snake.;2017-10-24 19:59:00;20 seconds;Skinny cylinder object moved through sky like a snake. I was walking my dog outside in North Edmond, when I noticed 3 small objects blinking red and green (which I have seen quite often), but out of nowhere a dark non-lighted slender cylinder object moved slowly across the sky in a snake-like fashion.  It lasted for about 20 seconds.  I was not able to get it on film because it was so dark outside and the object was also dark.;35.6423374100721;-97.4807938848921
12 Fireballs and one cylinder shaped craft  above Edmond, OK on Saturday, April 10, 2021 between 9:30 pm and 10:00 pm;2021-04-10 21:30:00;4 minutes;12 Fireballs and one cylinder shaped craft  above Edmond, OK on Saturday, April 10, 2021 between 9:30 pm and 10:00 pm https://www.dropbox.com/s/6gb38aylbes15yp/20210410_214642no%20audio.mp4?dl=0  Above is a link to the video.  On April 10, 2021, between 9:30 and 10:00 pm I went outside to make my dog come in.  To the south west of me, I could see these bright yellow fireballs, about the size of tennis balls, launching up from the horizon to just west of me.  Four launched and made a square pattern. I ran in the house and got my sister and grabbed my cell phone and started the video.  There were 3 fireballs making a triangle, and then one would fade and go out and another one would join them.  It happened several times that one would fade out and others would join.  There were approximately 12 fireballs that launched. When I went inside and looked at the video on my phone, I could see that there was something down below the yellow lights.  I couldn’t make it out so I uploaded to my desktop and big monitor, and I was shocked to see the cylinder shaped object down below the lights.  It was not visible with the naked eye. It was really dark that night, but I had no idea that cylinder was up there. I am a 62 year old female real estate broker. I’ve been in the business for 18 years, and I have owned my own brokerage for 16 years.  I had a computer company prior to that.   My sister is 68 years old and works at an oil and gas leasing company, and has had the same job for about 23 years. Tinker Air Force Base is not far from us.  My first thought is always the military.  I have asked all my military and pilot friends and they are also at a loss.  I have always believed in UFOs, but can’t say I have seen one till now.  Afterwards, it gave me a pretty creepy feeling to know this one was so close.  Is it another country spying on us?  I did go to the space.com website to see if anything launched on that day and time, and I could find nothing. I sent it to KFOR, one of our local TV stations, and the only reply that I got was that they had a lot of people calling in, but he attributed it to the Starlink Satellites that launched the Thursday before.  I am familiar with those, and this was nothing like it.  At least that did tell me other people were calling in.  I really don’t think he even looked at my video. I did send it to MUFON and an investigator called me and is checking into it.  If our government does not know about these things, then I think they should be made aware.  This just happened right before they were showing the Navy film of the UFOs on the news.  I made me start looking at the UFO videos on line and with the number of videos and sightings out there, I would think we should be a little more concerned about this then climate change. Please take a look and any information that you may have regarding what this might be, I would love to hear it.;35.6423374100721;-97.4807938848921
12 yellow fireballs that made patterns with a cylindrical object below the lights not visible with the naked eye.;2021-04-10 21:45:00;10 minutes;12 yellow fireballs that made patterns with a cylindrical object below the lights not visible with the naked eye. Approx. 12 yellow fireballs were observed. Shooting up from the west horizon to the northwest up high.  The first 4 made a square then one would fade off and another would shoot up and join the others and make a triangle, then one would fade off and others would come up and make more of an arrow.  My sister and I saw it and I grabbed my cell phone and took some video.  When I uploaded the video to my desktop and larger screen you could see a cylindrical shaped object down below the lights that we could not see with the naked eye.  We were surprised to see it.  We first thought it might be Chinese lanterns but clearly there was control over the fireballs to make the patterns. We thought maybe drones, but then what was the cylindrical shaped object. There was no sound at all. I reported it to one of our news stations and they said they had several reports but were blaming it on the Starlink satellites that were launched on Thursday.  These were not the Starlin! k satellites that appear in a straight line.    Very strange and would love to hear a logical explanation.
