2 witnesses 2  miles apart, Red & White Elongated-Cigar Shaped Flashing lights, NW of Oklahoma City;2013-09-09 23:00:00;17 minutes;2 witnesses 2  miles apart, Red & White Elongated-Cigar Shaped Flashing lights, NW of Oklahoma City At approximately 11pm I took my dogs out and always look up while they are doing their business.  I saw an elongated red and white light blinking in the sky North West of my location of Oklahoma City, OK.  I watched closely as the object was very far away but the lights kept blinking in an elongated-cigar shape fashion.  Although, I only saw red and white elongated lights, it did not look like it was moving.  I called my father who lives a mile and a half east of me.  He went out and saw the same elongated-cigar shape lights.  After approximately 7 minutes the lights were gone, but my father said he could still see them from his location.  As I stayed on the phone with him, he said he could see the lights as I stated, but he is colorblind so he could only tell me they were white but elongated-cigar shaped.  I asked him if the object was moving, he said looked like it was standing still.  I asked if he thought was an airplane, a star, a satellite, he replied no.   After approximately 10 more minutes he said he could no longer see anything.  The lights blinked out and were gone.  Although the craft was too far away, the lights both red and white were elongated-cigar shaped.   Approximately 11:21 CST I contacted Mr. Davenport.;35.6423374100721;-97.4807938848921
