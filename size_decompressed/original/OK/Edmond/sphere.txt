Spherical gray or black object with rotating ring of lights making humming noise.;2005-06-29 21:30:00;1 minute;Spherical gray or black object with rotating ring of lights making humming noise. My 6 year daughter was out in the driveway last night playing with a turtle we had found in the yard.  When I went outside, she told me she had seen a space ship.  Asked to describe it she said it was shaped like the planet with the rings.  She described the circular part as gray or black in color, but she wasn't sure because of the white light spinning around it (in the ring).  She described the object as large and slow moving.  She says it made a humming noise.  When I asked her if it was close or far away like an airplane, she said it was close and about the size of our living room ceiling.  When I asked her why she didn't run in and tell us, she said she was just staring at it and watched it until it left. She has never made up any outlandish stories before, so I felt like I needed to write down the details and found this website when searching Google.  I was trying to find out if anyone else reported any other strange sightings last night.;35.6423374100721;-97.4807938848921

2 different orbs in North Edmond, OK.;2015-08-27 21:30:00;5 minutes;2 different orbs in North Edmond, OK I left my home on N. Penn and Covell heading west to N. May Ave.  Heading south on May on the left side heading SW I saw a bright red orb that would change to a per second green pulse.  I timed the duration to every five seconds (solid red for five seconds, then green.   The green would pulse per second for five seconds then back to solid red).   I followed it to my destination on 164th and May and it began to hover and move erratically above a bank.   I go in, do my business, come back.  It was still hovering.  Then after I opened my car door, it vanished.   Heading north on May, I saw a bright yellowish orange slow moving orb with no pulsating lights slowly moving the same direction as the previous orb.  This one had a bright blue beam that would emit from the base.  It vanished when I approached Penn.;35.6423374100721;-97.4807938848921
