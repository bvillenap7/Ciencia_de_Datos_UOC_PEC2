Silver UFO seen in Edmond suddenly vanished;2020-09-30 17:08:00;30 seconds;Silver UFO seen in Edmond suddenly vanished It is a perfectly sunny day today.  There is not a cloud in the sky.  My kids and I were at our neighborhood pond, about to walk back home, when both my daughter (6.5 years old) and I noticed something in the sky.  She noticed it first and said “Mom what is that thing?” At first I thought it was a plane, because it was silver in the sky.  Then I realized it wasn’t a plane.  There were no wings on it, wasn’t leaving any type of trail behind it, and was lower in the sky.  This UFO was flying about helicopter height.  My next thought was that it could be a helium balloon that was silver, however this flashed in the light reflection of the sun so bright that I thought there was no way it could be a balloon.  We tried watching it, but no sooner than we were figuring out what it was, it moved forward and then literally disappeared.  Like out of thin air, seemed to disappear.  My daughter said it looked like there were two black “antennas” on it on the front, however I did not notice that.  We kept searching in the sky for a sign of it after it vanished, but could find nothing.;35.6423374100721;-97.4807938848921
