At approx. 345 on 8/13/2012 while watching the Perseids Meteor Shower, my son and myself witnessed just barely towards the east but nearly straight up in the sky 2 objects that were identical to the stars, but they were moving one behind the other across the sky and then suddenly disapeared.  Both these objects were extremely high in the sky and what looked well beyond that of typical aircraft. There were no blinking lights. There was no noise.  Both objects were exactly the same brilliance and stayed perfectly one behind the other traveling at what looked like a very high rate of speed. They did not travel the speed of meteors, but rather a steady speed more like an aircraft. I am 46 years of age....my boy 10 years old. I have always been an outdoorsman and am well familiar of the night skies.  This was unlike anything I have ever seen. Both my son and I were completely amazed at what we saw and I am hoping that this was also witnessed by some others due to the Perseid Meteors Shower peaking over the last two days.;35.6423374100721;-97.4807938848921
