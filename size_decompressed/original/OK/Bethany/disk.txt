We noticed a big, bright light shimmering, right in front of us, not too high in the sky.;1970-05-15 17:30:00;5-10 minutes;Mom was driving me home from a tutor lesson in Bethany, Oklahoma, in 1970, I was 10 years old.  She drove west on 39th Expressway also known as Rt. 66. As we were coming up to Council Rd. we noticed a big, bright light shimmering, right in front of us, not too high in the sky, the light looked reflective, like it was reflecting the sun. We both were questioning what in the world it could be.  The light shifted left, right then left, as if it blinked off for a split second, and back on in a different place in the sky. Mom then turned South onto Overholser Drive.  I remember yelling out for her to pull over, she pulled off to the side of the road, the light that we saw was now a disc object hovering above a field to our left. I pressed my face against the glass window and look up, we saw a huge dull metal colored disc, it made no sound at all.  I was really scared and started crying.  I remember ducking down in the seat to hide.  I don't recall my Mom saying anything after she turned off the road.  I guess she was trying to process it all!  I cried for her to take us home!  We lived just a few short blocks away from where this happened.  She drove us home, our house backed up to Overholser Dr.  I ran to the backyard and looked down the street to see if I could see anything, it was gone. We both told my Sister and my Dad what had happened, they both just laughed and made little green men jokes to us. We have talked about it from time to time, over the years.  Mom is 87 years old and still remembers.  I'm 58 and will never forget what we saw that day. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));35.5081;-97.6403
