A supersonic plane?;2010-08-24 21:45:00;60s;A supersonic plane? UFO seen at night as a bright light like a star except brighter traveling very fast headed northeast.  It seemed to wobble side to side a little.   It took about 60 seconds to travel the majority of the sky, and may have made one minor direction change.  As it moved off in the distance it all of a sudden shut off the bright light and seemed to have a red glow before we could no longer see it.  I think it was some sort of supersonic aircraft that was flying along with its afterburners then shut them down.
