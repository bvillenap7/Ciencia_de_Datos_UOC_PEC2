Star looking object moving in zig zagging shapes and various speeds and Changing colors  ((NUFORC Note:  Sirius.  PD));2004-03-21 21:00:00;4 hours;Star looking object moving in zig zagging shapes and various speeds and Changing colors The item was seen at 9:00 pm on March 20, 2004.  It looked like a star.  However it was brighter that the rest of the star in the sky. Also it looked like a triangle with the light moving in the center of the beem. Then about every 5 min.  It stared moving up and down, left to right , and in the bottom half of a circle.  but only moving about 2 inches in the sky ( as seen with the necked eye).  The Item was seen by ten people.  Also the item seemed to go dimmer and the bright. ( pulsating) and sometimes you could see a red  light and a light blue light.  That night I called the Woodward County sherrifs office around 11:00 pm.  to file a report and was not taken seriously.  I asked the dispacter to send a Sheriffs depauty to the location I was at.  They told me they would let inform them and if they where not  busy they would send someone out.  They never showed up.   Then the next night I looked in the sky ( March 21, 2004)  and saw the exect same thing.  My wife and I where the only two to see this object. we where also the only  two people looking. We saw the same thing as the previous night.  However the object moved around like a laying down number 8.  It also zigged zaged numerous times.  but nver moving more than two inches in the sky as seen by the necked eye.  The object was located by what I would call the little dipper.  Look at the panhadle of the little dipper and move two stars over that are in a staight line and up.  Only bright looking star ( the rest look dim and only star the looks like it is pulsating in color.) ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect Sirius is what the witnesses were looking at.
