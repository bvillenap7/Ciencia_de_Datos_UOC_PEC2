Silvery triangle object in Oklahoma skies;2001-09-19 09:38:00;5 min;Silvery triangle object in Oklahoma skies I was changing the price signs on gas pumps where I work, in Woodward, Oklahoma when something caught my eye. There was a silvery triangle shaped object going from west to east, much faster than any jet could. As I watched, it stopped in mid-air without slowing, stopped, turned invisible to my eyes, anyhow, and went back west at an incredible rate of speed. As I watched, it stopped in midair again, and dropped straight down towards the ground and became invisible before landing, or going wherever it went. Maybe five minutes afterwards, there was an incredibily loud sonic boom. A few minutes later, there were two more sonic booms. The triangle shaped object, which was reflective and silvery looking, made no sound. ((NUFORC Note:  Second report from same witness.  PD));36.42828;-99.4009366666667
Silvery triangle in Oklahoma skies..changes directions  instantly;2001-09-19 09:38:00;5 min;Silvery triangle in Oklahoma skies..changes directions  instantly this sighting was made the morning of sept 19th about 9:30 in the morning. I was changing the price signs on the gas pumps at the travel center where I work in Woodward Oklahoma. As I was taking down the old signs, something caught my eye in the sky. I looked to see a huge silvery triangle traveling at an impossibly fast speed going from west to east. It stopped in mid-air, without slowing, became invisible for a couple seconds, then sped off west. It stopped, again- mid-air, without slowing, then dropped straight down out of the sky then became invisible once more. Following this, I heard a very loud sonic boom and heard the roar of a jet, but did not see a jet. A short time after that, I heard two more sonic booms. Thank You for having a site where we can share these things. ((NUFORC Note:  One of three reports of same incident from same witness.
