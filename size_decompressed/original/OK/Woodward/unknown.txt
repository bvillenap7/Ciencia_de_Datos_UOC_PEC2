possible ufo sighting;2004-11-10 11:30:00;10 minutes;possible ufo sighting we were sitting inside of our home and we heard a loud sound that kept getting louder and louder til it sounded like it was right above our house. it even rumbled our house. we ran outside and saw what looked to be a blue light moving sw towards the field  station, not far from our home.  then all of a sudden, the light disappeared and the sound just stopped while it was in midair. i would like an explanation about this strange occurence. i know that other people saw the same thing because it was close to their house as well. this was the loudest thing i have ever heard and for it to disappear all of a sudden was very freaky!
