Multiple UFOs Around The Moon Looking Through Telescope;2019-06-17 09:46:00;1 hour;Multiple UFOs Around The Moon Looking Through Telescope I was using my Telescope to look at the moon like I do all the time.  During viewing the moon Multiple objects started coming from behind the moon.  Some zoomed across the moon.  Many went behind or beside and some met up and then zoomed off.  There was multiple objects at least a hundred.  This lasted for about an hour. Iâ€™ve been looking at the moon through my telescope since 2017 and have NEVER seen anything like this before in my life.  I do Astrophotography through my Celestron Nexstar 8SE and like I said all this time and have never seen anything like it.  I did get some video with my phone attached to the telescope. This stunned all of us watching.;34.9849;-96.8763
