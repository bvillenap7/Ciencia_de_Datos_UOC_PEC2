My daughter and I were sitting on our deck, at our rural home about 7 miles Southeast of Kansas, Ok, facing West.  We were watching a jet that had just flown over.  It appeared to be heading West to the Tulsa,OK airport.  Suddenly from the North we saw a solid reddish orange glowing disk shaped object going very fast.  At first, we discussed later, we both thought it was a missle that was going to hit the jet we were watching.  From our angle, it appeared to be heading right for it. In our excitment of what we were viewing, we both stood to our feet bracing for what we thought was about to happen.  However, it went below and behind the jet.  That is when we knew it was not a missle or any vehicle we had ever seen before.  It traveled at a speed faster than any jet could ever go, as we watched it go Southward.  There was no sound.  We could even hear the jet that had gone over still in the distance but no sound with this object. I thought to myself that it reminded me of how a bubble would act in a very fast wind. It seemed to go slightly up and down, as if floating but in a determined Southward direction.  We watched until it went out of sight.  With out saying a word we looked at each other and ran in the house.  Only then, did we both confirm between us what we had seen but could not explain. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
