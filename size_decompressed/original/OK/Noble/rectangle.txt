Large rectangular space ship moving silently across the sky.;2001-05-01 21:00:00;2 minutes;Large rectangular space ship moving silently across the sky. The UFO was a large craft, about 50 yards long and 20 yards wide.   My wife and I had just stepped out on the porch and it was late evening.  It was a very clear sky.   We seen this craft that was black in color and rectangular.  It had flashing lights on it and was moving about 200 ft. above us.  I don't know the speed, but for that large of an object, it cleared the sky above going from south to north in under a minute.  I wish I would have had a camera.  It was so large, yet was so silent.   The reason I am telling this now is because I seen where someone else described the exact same ship that I seen.  It was the sighting in Weatherford ,OK. on 8/15/2001.  This also happened close to the same time frame. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));35.1417;-97.3409
