Diamond star ufo sighted.;2014-11-27 05:50:00;20 minutes;Diamond star ufo sighted. it was in eastern sky.  I watched for 10 minutes or so.  Then got my sister up to verify I wasn't nuts.  It looked like a star, but it would move up/down/forward/backwards.  And not at same time there would be shooting lights come from it at different times.   I tried using my phone to record, but to far away.;36.7149;-97.0638282051281
