Object tailing military jet;2002-03-15 17:30:00;2 or 3 minutes;Object tailing military jet Ponca City, OK This account is going to be a bit vague because this event occurred sometime back ... In March of 2002, I think, I was cleaning our front yard.  I happened to look up upon hearing the sound of a jet.  The sky was partly cloudy but very clear.  The jet was a fighter with an over all triangular shape but definitely man made like the ones that patrolled New York after 911.  It was a rare site but not so unusual that I was anything more than fascinated. It moved due west and just before going out of site veered slightly north.  The aircraft was perhaps 3000 to 4000 feet up just below most of the clouds.   I watched it until it disappeared behind a cloud somewhat west of straight overhead.  I continued watching hoping to catch another glimce.  I could hear the aircraft with the appropriate delay the whole time. While still looking I noticed another craft of a very different shape apparently following the jet.  Its relationship to the jet was such that it could very easily have been in the jet's blind spot. It seemed to be lower in the sky and traveling as if to remain in the jet's blind spot as the jet turned north. It was silent.  I remember listening carefully for the delayed sound.  It was roughly oblong and changed shape to nearly circular and back to oblong.  I presumed this was due to a changing attitude from my point of view.  It had the same dark metallic coloring of the jet. It's movements were more exaggerated as if cutting a wider arc to maintain in the same relative position to the jet. It also disappeared in the clouds but below the cloud the jet disappeared behind. I wish I had had the presents of mind to record the time and date and any other details noticed at the time.
