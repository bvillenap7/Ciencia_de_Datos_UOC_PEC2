night sighting of large triangle object;1999-07-28 22:00:00;10 mins;night sighting of large triangle object Around July in 1999, my family and I were camping at kaw lake just outside of Ponca City.  It was late at night, my best guess would be around ten p.m.  My family was sitting around the campfire and I walked out to look at the lake.  Across the lake directly West of where I was standing on the opposite bank were three lights that formed a triangle.  The triangle it formed was huge and originally I though that it was merely the intersecting  of three tower lights, perhaps from the plant that is in Ponca City or from oil rigs.   As I continued looking at it, however, I noticed that it was moving.  It was moving very very slowly and was very close to the ground.  Since I knew it was moving I started to consider maybe it was three military airplanes flying together in formation and I was looking at their front lights.  That didn’t match up either though because as low as it was there is no aircraft that I know of that could fly that slow.  Also, I ruled out that it was three separate aircrafts because the lights started to turn off one at a time.  One would turn off and then come back on, another might flicker and go off and then come back.  I watched it for about 5-10mins and then left.  I have never really believed in aliens and what I saw intrigued me but that’s about it.  It was just recently that I saw a show on flying triangle ufos and was shocked that the footage that was shown on that show was the same thing I had seen over the lake years ago.
