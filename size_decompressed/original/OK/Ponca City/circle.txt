Glowing red, round object flying fast over Ponca City, Oklahoma;2007-07-04 20:00:00;1 min;Glowing red, round object flying fast over Ponca City, Oklahoma My family and I had just returned from my land out west of town where we launched fireworks until rain started to fall. We were standing by the car talking about the events of the day when I caught a glimpse of an object traveling at a high rate of speed under the cloud cover of a storm system that was moving in. It was bright red, and round in shape. It was traveling from West to East. It had a diameter of about 30ft, and it was not just the color of red, but rather glowed red. I quickly noted the speed and oddness of it and my step father said he was wondering about it too, out of the 4 of us only him and I were facing the best direction to see have seen it. It was so quick that the other two were unable to turn quick enough to catch a glimpse. It was not a light reflected off the clouds, because I saw it in the opening of the cloud cover first then it traveled under the cloud bank as it headed Eastward. There was no sound associated with it and no other affects from it. It did not leave a tail or anything visible behind it. It did not vanish but rather maintained it's speed and direction and traveled out of sight. A few minute prior to the passing a shuttle had went over head landing at the local airport. Nothing else was seen in the sky.;36.7149;-97.0638282051281
