Ponca City, Ok about 1830 hrs, long shaped object with no sound;2009-07-02 18:30:00;3 minutes;Ponca City, Ok about 1830 hrs, long shaped object with no sound This at first thought was an airplane, but it had no wings and no tail.  It was a missile.  I know what missles look like spend time in military. It was over the town of Ponca City, oklahoma. It was white, but had no sound, it was not to high off the ground heading north to kansas.  It really disturbed me. I spent 10 years and my dad was in the air force for 20. I have never seen any thing like this, someone had to have seen it also. I even called the police department here.
