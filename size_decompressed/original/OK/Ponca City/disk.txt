First i thought it was a plane , then i realized it wasn't because it was shaped like a  disc. i was watching it , and then started to think it was a ufo. It looked silver, but bright like a reflection.  It was moving straight then it would move left then back to the same place. I ran inside to get someone, then when we came back it was gone.;36.7149;-97.0638282051281
