Itâ€™s been there recently during the past week.  Looking North at about 45 degrees see another bright light which  seems stationary, but disappears after 3-5 seconds.  Not spotted anywhere else in sky.  (It was not quite as large as planet in the west, but close in size. Quite bright.  Do satellites just blink out that  way?
