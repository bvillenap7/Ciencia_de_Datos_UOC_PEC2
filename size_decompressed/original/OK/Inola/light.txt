Strange flashing lights.;2003-11-02 22:00:00;2 Hours;Strange flashing lights. While unlocking the gate at the end of our driveway, I noticed a strangely bright light to the East that seemed to flash. I soon asked my wife to come out and confirm what I saw. After getting binoculars we noticed that the light flashed with red, blue, and green lights and remained stationary. As we began to look around, we noticed 5 other of these objects and none moved for the first few minutes. One to the south east began to move erratically and after about 2 hours the object appeared to move further away. I don't know if it means anything, but almost every cow, mule, horse, and dog in the area was very upset  and this is nt normal. We looked again tonight and only saw one in the northeast sky. We also checked the lights against stars and planes....obviously they don't match up.;36.1531;-95.5257
