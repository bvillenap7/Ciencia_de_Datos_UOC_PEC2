cloaked UFO at high school track.;2010-10-30 22:23:00;35 mins;cloaked UFO at high school track   On October 30th, 2010, me and 3 friends experienced 2 UFOs at our high school track.  At first we were going to go ghost hunting around the nearby haunted high school. We got out of the car and saw the last thing we thought we would see…  A flying object in the sky, way too close to the ground! It was outlined like a triangle or diamond with lights on the outlining (yellow, kinda orange lights, five of them) but what I noticed is that you couldn’t really see anything in the middle, like it was cloaked or something. We were very alarmed by this so we started walking towards the direction it went (northern, kinda).  After about 15 mins went by we started to walk back (we had seen it once again, but with 3 lights this time).  When we were walking back, all of a sudden, we hear coyotes howling but there was no moon?! We looked back and it was the same UFO we saw but this time it was coming towards us! We ran back to the car, frightened.  At first the car wouldn’t s! tart, but we drove back to the house and saw the flying object once again!  The object was totally silent...no noise at all.;35.2686;-97.7499
