Cigar-shaped object moving quickly with a bright and long trail.;2015-06-10 04:55:00;10 seconds;Cigar shaped object moving quickly with a bright and long trail. Me and a few friends were outside enjoying the nice weather.  We were just about to head inside when the craft appeared.  It was maybe half of an inch in the sky, it looks like it was at a relatively high elevation and ascending.  The object itself looks like a pen or cigar we could not tell the exact color but it did seem as though it were changing colors.   What really made it visible was it's trail!  The trail to our eyesight looked like six inches long or so, no telling how long it was in reality, since it was so far away.  It had two trails, one above, one below. The trail(s) looked whitish blue.   Really weird, no noise, but a few minutes later there was a lot of wind (no wind before).   We were looking east and it seemed like it was headed south and ascending.  Finally disappeared into the cover of darkness after seven to twelve seconds, too fast to get it on camera...not enough time... unlike any unidentified object I have ever seen.  We will not forget this one.;35.2686;-97.7499
