Lights over Oklahoma City;1989-05-01 22:00:00;all night;Lights over Oklahoma City All kinds of people witnessed lights in the sky in Oklahoma City some time in spring.  We ended up cooking out to watch the beautiful lights move and change.  It was on the news that people were witnessing this event but the reporters, police, etc. could not determine what is was nor did they follow up with other reports.  It was a documented situation throughout the city. My brother had a personal experience on this night while driving on the highway.  He and his friend personally witnessed an aircraft of some sort near the airport, hovering over their car.  Anyway, I just wanted to report this so that you could follow up perhaps.
