Teardrop shaped object in the night-sky...;2010-11-27 19:25:00;5 seconds;Teardrop shaped object in the night-sky... Probably around 7:25 PM, a friend and I decided to go lie down in some grass and look up at the sky...to the left of us, we see this white teardrop shaped object in the sky (probably the size of a quarter, in the shape like an oval and a pointed end like <o or so) just for about three seconds. Later that night, about 9:25 PM or so, I (myself only this time) see it again! I see it much more visibly this time, since I was looking right at it.  Both times it was headed a North-Eastern direction.  It would light up, white-ish, with a white-ish shadow around it and immediately go out about 5 seconds later...It was travelling at a VERY fast speed and it made no sound what so ever. Each time it went by it seemed like the dogs were going crazy, no wind at all.;35.2686;-97.7499
