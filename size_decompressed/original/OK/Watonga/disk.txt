((HOAX??))  Tornado watching turns into ufo sighting.;2014-05-27 12:00:00;1:00;Tornado watching turns into ufo sighting. I was working when I saw a wall cloud go overhead so I starting recording it.  To my surprise a tornado formed and dropped out of the sky about 400 yds to my west.   I started taking pictures of the video and didn't see the ufo until later.  This was not the first time I have seen a ufo. another time when I was 11 or 12 and many witness were there at that time the ufo was big about the size of a football field with colored lights going around the middle, it also seemed as though there big windows all around.  This again was a big saucer type. ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date appear to us to be flawed, and witness provides no valid e-address.  We wonder whether this might be a hoax.  PD));35.8514;-98.4163
