Upon returning to camp with the dog, I noticed in the western sky an area that would rythmically glow/light up.  The main shape inside where it would glow appeared to have a similar shape to the little dipper hanging straight down.  There were no clouds in the sky, but this area seemed to eminate through a fog.  We watch for several minuets to about 30 mins. and it never moved. One in our group did take some video.  There were a couple of plane that flew below this thing and they were dwafted by it's size.  Would love to know what we saw, as all four of us saw it.;34.0223;-97.9427
