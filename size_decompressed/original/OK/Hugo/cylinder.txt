Sighting of large bright silver orb-like craft followed by sighting of 2 cylinder silent craft.;2003-09-15 15:00:00;10 minutes;Sighting of large bright silver orb-like craft followed by sighting of 2 cylinder silent craft. On 09-16-03 about 15:00 hrs. my wife and I were driving back from Hugo to home and my wife spotted a silver orb or globe shaped object, perfectly round and I saw also. We watched for about 3-4 minutes and orb (very large) then turned from bright slver to dull grey and vanished. Seemed to be about 5000 ft. or higher & large. We turned onto a county road off highway and then spotted two light brown or tan cylinder objects with blunt ends, about the size of 757 jet. They were drifting SW about 600-800 ft. in the air, perfectly silent, and went over horizon out of sight. This was on a day with sky mostly clear with a few patchy clouds. Slight wind from north. Heard no sound on cylinders. Cylinders drifted away from us to SW and did not change color but drifted silently out of sight. Ths all happened in the length of a few minutes. First sighting of the bright, silver orb or globe high up to the west of town and then almost immediately thereafter, sighting the 2 lt. brown or tan large cylinders drifting silently to sw of town. Both y wife and I saw the same thing. She stayed in car and I got out in the road and watched. My wife drew drawings of the objects we saw.;34.0179;-95.5095000000001
