Very bright, mirror like, skewed rectangle shaped object over southeastern Oklahoma.;2010-11-09 21:19:00;30 secs;Very bright, mirror like, skewed rectangle shaped object over southeastern Oklahoma. Was leaving a neighborhood on the north side of Hugo OK that is very open with no trees.  To the west-southwest was a very bright light in the sky, about 20 degrees off the horizon.  It was bright like a mirror shining in the sunlight, the entire thing was bright.  It was shaped like a skewed rectangle, about a third tall as it was long, which was about an inch long at arms length.  It appeared to be heading on a northerly course, which took it further down toward the horizon.  It went from a west-south west position to a westerly position in about twenty-twentyfive seconds.  My position changed about a hundred yards south during this time (in a moving vehicle, going south on the open drive).  It was very bright, but appeared a solid rectangle shape, no small lights - the entire thing was lit up. It didn't flare up like a meteorite might, and it appeared to retain it's symmetrical shape the entire time.  I lost sight of it at the end of the drive as I came upon some trees.  No sound, and I was probably too far away anyway.;34.0179;-95.5095000000001
A square object with lots of windows/openings VERY close to my vehicle with a BRIGHT pure white blinking light.;2019-02-07 21:00:00;15 minutes;A square object with lots of windows/openings VERY close to my vehicle with a BRIGHT pure white blinking light. I was driving East from Soper to Hugo on Hwy 70.   At about 12 miles from Hugo, I saw a very large pure white blinking light.  The light was huge and I kept thinking I must be getting close.  I did not arrive at the object that was blinking for another 10 miles from where I first spotted it.  I couldnâ€™t see the object until it was right above my car.  I could only see the object when the light would blink on.  When the light would blink off, it was totally dark and unseen.  I saw a rectangular shape and at first sight it looked like a large wooden crate with many openings/windows in it.  When I got a better look, the whole object looked silver/gray.  It was floating at a 45 degree angle.  I could see directly underneath it and I saw 6 red lights in an inverted V pattern.  The object was silent and floating effortlessly.  It was right below the power lines so it was very close.  It suddenly turned to the southeast and took off very fast.;34.0179;-95.5095000000001
