Possible satellites in a formation?;1999-07-04 22:00:00;1 to 2 min.;Possible satellites in a formation? I was at the 4th of July fireworks show in Pauls Valley. The show had just ended, and the stadium lights were still off, so the stars were very visible. I observed 3 points of light directly straight up above me (NOT fireworks), which were very similar to what satellites look like (at the same altitude), moving slowly in opposite directions of each other.   Almost as if at some point they had formed a tight triangle formation and were now spreading apart.   I really don't know anything about the orbit patterns of satellites, so I assumed at the time that it must be possible for 3 satellites to cross patterns with each other like that.  When the stadium lights came back on, I lost complete view of them.   I wrote it off at the time, but the more I have thought about it since then, the stranger it seems to me.  That was 11 years ago, and in that decade of sky gazing, I have yet to see anything that matches what I saw in 1999.  Possibly satellites, but the part of me that saw how strange it looked is why I am reporting it now.;34.7347;-97.2197
