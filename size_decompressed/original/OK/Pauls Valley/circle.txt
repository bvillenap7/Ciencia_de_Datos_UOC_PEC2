It was Dark outside. There was little cloud cover.  The objects were first seen by another person in my household, as she went outside to see why the dogs were barking.  Three other people and I came outside to see if it was real.  We looked to the northeast, and we saw these strange objects floating up from behind the trees.  They would very quickly move north west.  The objects were a bright orange, and they looked like they were on fire, in a way.  When I had zoomed in on them with my camera, I could see that they were perfect circles with a smaller, dark circle in the middle.  They were also flashing.  They flew quite quickly across the sky, though some of them flew at different speeds.  Sometimes, they would move in an „X“ Formation.  Once they crossed, they would disappear.  There also appeared to be an aura around the objects.;34.7347;-97.2197
