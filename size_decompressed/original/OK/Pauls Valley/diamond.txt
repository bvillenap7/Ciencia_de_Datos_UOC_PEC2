Diamond shaped craft seen during the day.;2002-07-24 10:00:00;5 min;Diamond shaped craft seen during the day. My Daughter and I were driving North on I-35 towards Purcell I noticed what appeared to be a kite stuck in the high lines on the West side of the Highway. As I got nearer to the Highlines I noticed it was a craft of some kind just hovering in the sky. I pointed this out to my daughter and we both observed the craft as it hovered there. It was a diamond shape and was of a Silver metalic color. I rolled the window down to see if there was any sound and could hear none. After observing the craft for about 5 Minutes It sped off to the NE at a high rate of speed. The best way to describe the speed is to say it was there and then it was gone in the blink of an eye. I have been searching the net to see if anyone else has seen anything like this in our area.;34.7347;-97.2197
