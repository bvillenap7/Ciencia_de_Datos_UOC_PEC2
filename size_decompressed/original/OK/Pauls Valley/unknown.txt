Two large bright white lights hovering over tree line on HWY 19, between Pauls Valley and Maysville.;2007-11-25 22:10:00;15 sec;Two large bright white lights hovering over tree line on HWY 19, between Pauls Valley and Maysville. I was driving west on  HWY 19, between Pauls Valley and Maysville, OK.  The time was approx. 8:10pm.  It was misting and was foggy.   All of a sudden I saw two very bright white lights that were sort of square/rectangled shaped.  I was mesmerized and couldn’t take my eyes off of them.  They were the brightest, white, crystal clear (like diamonds) and were sort of sparkled with blue.   They both pulsed at the same time every 1-2 seconds.  I could “feel” the lights when they pulsed on, but I can’t explain exactly how I “felt” them.  The lights seemed to pulse outwards a little, but mainly they seemed to have more depth going inward.   These lights didn’t dissipate like normal lights. They seemed to have very defined edges.  When the lights pulsed “on”, I could see a light colored gray area between the two lights.  The color between the lights were a light gray and looked smooth.   Underneath the lights I could see that there was something underneath the lights (similar to the area between the lights) that became more narrow the further it went.  The lights were not moving at all.  They were a little higher than the tree lines.   I wanted to stop to get a better look, but I had a feeling of unexplained dread and anxiety.  My two children also saw all of this.   When I couldn’t see it anymore (because my car was moving) and the lights were out of my field of vision, I straightened my car back in my driving lane.  Then, I turned and looked back (through my back windshield) and there was nothing there.;34.7347;-97.2197
