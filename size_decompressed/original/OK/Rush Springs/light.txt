A very fast light headed from the ground towards the sky.;2002-09-29 05:15:00;2-4 seconds;A very fast light headed from the ground towards the sky. There was a flash of light that looked like a star only it started at the tree tops and went in a diagonal line upwards and was traveling extremely fast and disappeared when it got to the skyline.  there is not an air park or anything in the area that the object seemed to be coming from. My husband and I were headed out to our cattle lot to unload a semi load of cattle and I witnessed it out of my passenger side window. My husband did not look in time to see it.  He tried to reassure me that it was probably a meteor or something, but as far as I know they do not shoot up from above the tree line into the sky. It was then that I became a little scared to be out in the dark close to the place where it looked to have come from.;34.7706;-97.9431
