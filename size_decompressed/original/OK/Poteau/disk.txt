In July of 2005 I was driving up the back side of Cavanal Hill in Poteau, Oklahoma we had went up Pleasant Valley Road to get there, while traveling up the hill (which is the largest hill in the world at 1999 feet) there was a suacer shaped object with blue and red lights.  My friend grabbed his laser pointer and pointed it toward the saucer craft whichwas just above tree top level.  The craft lit up and rapidly took off at an incredible speed.;35.0606;-94.6096
