White Light Glimmering Correction*;2010-07-03 20:45:00;5 minutes or longer;White Light Glimmering Correction* I and another man were on top of Cavanal Hill it was about 8:45 P.M. and were there to shoot pictures of the Poteau, Oklahoma fireworks display.   While setting up for the fireworks display I was distracted by the other man saying is that a fire?  At that time I arose and looked due southeast toward the Poteau Mountains where he had pointed.  There was a white light glimmering from the top of the Poteau Mountains and stayed there for at least 5 minutes or more.  We thought it was a fire on the mountain but soon discovered it was not producing smoke, the fireworks show started and we forgot all about it.   Today I was going through photos and remembered the light.  Not sure what it was but know it was not a fire (lack of smoke) and not fireworks because it was there for so long. I tried taking a picture of it but the stratus clouds coming in would not allow me to focus it in, plus the light and Poteau Mountains had to be 10 miles away.;35.0606;-94.6096
6 reddish/orange lights hovering in sky;2013-08-07 22:00:00;30 seconds;6 reddish/orange lights hovering in sky My daughter and I were sitting outside and observed 6 very big reddish/orange lights that appeared out of nowhere in the sky at approximately 45* from horizon.  They stayed in perfect line and seemed to be perfectly spaced as well.   All the lights disappeared at the same time after about 30 seconds.   Not believing what we had just witnessed, we went in to get my husband and son.  As we were describing what we had witnessed, they appeared again.  Same color, formation.   After witnessing the lights the second time, they did not reappear.  Directly after the disappearance, 2 jets flew over as if they were trying to catch up to the mysterious lights and i say this as it is very unusual for jets to be flying at that time of night, especially in our area.  Unfortunately, i did not have my camera on hand.;35.0606;-94.6096
