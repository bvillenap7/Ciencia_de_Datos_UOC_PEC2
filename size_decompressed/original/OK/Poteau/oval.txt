Oval lights over north side of Cavanal Hill Poteau Ok August 18, 2013;2013-08-18 08:45:00;15 minutes;Oval lights over north side of Cavanal Hill Poteau Ok August 18, 2013 On the evening of August 18, 2013 after church we stopped at Wal-Mart before going home.   After leaving Wal-Mart we looked due west over the north side of Cavanal Hill and saw six oval lights.  These oval lights were still and not blinking. Sought out the worker at Murphy's USA gas station who would know if these lights were normal, since I had just moved back into the area and she said they were not associated with Cavanal Hill.  The oval lights just slowly dissipated one by one in uniform.  I was able to shoot pictures of the oval lights and will send pictures.;35.0606;-94.6096
