Shadow in the Atmosphere;2010-06-30 09:45:00;2 minutes;On June 30, 2010 at 9:45 A.M. I and another witness were traveling on Old Highway 112 between Cameron and Poteau, Oklahoma, just west of of Gilmore when we saw a shadow in the atmosphere.  The shadow covered thin width and stretched horizontally across half the sky.  I exclaimed, What the heck is that?  The other witness said, What?  I showed her the shadow and she could not believe what we were seeing.   I thought it must be an atmospheric disturbance of some sort and after about a minute the shadow began to fade.   After 2 minutes the shadow was gone but a faint smell of smoke was noticed in the air which lasted a few seconds.  Soon afterwards where the shadow had been in the sky a wide contrail took its place...... Not sure what to make of this.......;35.0606;-94.6096
