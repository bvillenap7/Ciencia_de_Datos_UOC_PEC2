I grabbed my camera and took pictures of these craft.  Just decided over the last few days to report this sighting.  My wife, son, myself and a Murphy's USA attendant plus other people who were in Walmart parking lot could see the 2 crafts.  They hung in the sky for about 10 minutes and then just like turning off a light they disappeared.   I will be sending you the picture of this event and maybe you can make heads or tails of it.;35.0606;-94.6096

Couldn't tell if I could see the stars through it and the sky is very cold and clear so more than usual amount of stars are visible;35.0606;-94.6096
