Red round light changing colors traveled silently over Dewey Oklahoma;2012-07-07 21:50:00;2 minutes;Red round light changing colors traveled silently over Dewey Oklahoma A friend and I were sitting on the back porch at about 9:50 pm on a cloudless dark night.  We seen a round shaped flying object traveling in the direction of 282 degrees.   It was dead silent, big dark red in color and it slightly changed colors to a lighter red almost orange as it traveled.  It was going too fast to be a plane and too slow to be a meteorite.  We captured it on video as it traveled silently.   We are very curious to know what it was.;36.805;-95.9383
