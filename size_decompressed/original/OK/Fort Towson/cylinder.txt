Thursday, 11/23/2012 05:00pm Around a quarter to five in the evening I went out to feed my horse.  After feeding her I walked over to her water trough to clean out the debris.  I’m hearing a lot of birds chirping overhead so I look up and notice a very long fairly thick flock of birds flying from the NE to west, south. Very big long line, I keep looking straight up to see what kind of birds they were. Looked like a couple different small species.  I kept watching for what seemed like around 10 minutes.  The end of the flock was flying further to the north curving south.  That is when I saw the craft. Much larger than the birds, it was cylindrical, about 3 times larger around and a little bit longer than a large jet at a similar altitude.  I noticed that there was a lack of a wing profile, that’s when it got more of my attention. It was moving slightly faster than a large jet at a similar altitude.  I noticed a lack of any contrail, no signs of exhaust or smoke and no sound.   Then it started to shimmer, (the sh! immer seemed to be divided down the center by a dark equal sized line), under the whole vehicle sort of like a sun reflection but most definitely a glowing shimmering red, orange light. Then I heard a deep quick thud, almost a pop, and it was gone. The impression I got was that it cloaked. The last part was like watching special effects in a movie. I didn’t see any clouds and I had an unobstructed view.;34.0534;-95.2514
