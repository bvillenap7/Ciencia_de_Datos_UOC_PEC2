UFO Orb Report;2002-09-20 19:49:00;20 Min.;UFO Orb Report Tonight 9/20/2002, at approximately 7:49 PM Central time, I had stepped outside and I observed what appeared to me to be a orb type UFO that was almost directly over my house here in Elk City, Oklahoma. (100 miles west of Oklahoma City on I-40). I noticed the object was perfectly round, and it was extremely bright- almost too bright to look at directly at first. I also noted a unusual white florescence to it. On closer examination with my 10 x 50 binoculars, it appeared to have 2-3 internal lights of some kind that were clearly visible, similar to a hot air balloon would have. However, it was not a balloon. No other details were noted. It flew in a westerly direction roughly following I-40 toward Amarillo. After it flew from overhead, and at about a 45 degree angle to the horizon, it started to rapidly change colors to a yellow, then a bright red and finally to a deep blue-purple internal glow that it maintained until it disappeared. I was able to estimate the object to be at about 5,000 feet, and moving at about 25-30 miles per hour, and it was moving steadily to the west. At the time of the sighting we had a SE wind at 5-7 mph. The object was in sight until about 8:15 PM when it winked out as I was watching it through binoculars. It went from about a 80 degree overhead angle to about 20 degrees above the horizon in that time. At it's closest it was about 1/2 the size of the full moon, or about the size of your thumb at arm's length. I have eliminated weather balloons, planets, stars, aircraft and blimps as a possible explanation. I did notice Venus in the southwest sky about 10-15 degrees above the horizon. The object did not resemble Venus or a star. There were no aircraft in the area at the time of the sighting.;35.4123;-99.4250000000001
