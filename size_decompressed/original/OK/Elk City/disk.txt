Flying disk that looks silver in color and is moving extremely fast;2000-07-18 09:20:00;two seconds;Flying disk that looks silver in color and is moving extremely fast I am a golf pro and while I was video taping a golf lesson an object appeared.  The camera was facing south and the object moved from SE to the NW at a high rate of speed.  The object was moving so fast that we did not see it with the naked eye.  When we replayed the video that is when we discovered the object. I beleive I can see shadows on the bottom side of the object because of the sun.  As the object moves the shadow changes in relation with the rising sun.  At first sight of the object it appears over some trees and then disappears at the top right corner of the screen. ((NUFORC Note:  Please see report from the person whose golf swing was being video-taped.  We are awaiting receipt of a copy of the tape.  PD));35.4123;-99.4250000000001
