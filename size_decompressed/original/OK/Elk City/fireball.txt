At the same time a unidentified blue object showering sparks overtook the fighters and reportedly crashed into the ground north of the town of Elk City, Oklahoma. City police was monitored as saying it looked like meteors, or a comet, or a UFO... It was seen by multiple witness's from as far west as Shamrock Tx and east to Clinton, Ok. north to Cheyenne, and south to Granite, Ok. The object was seen to have landed north of town and had started a fire, this was reported by Hammond, Ok. Police.

It seems we have a multipliable witness sighting here. Police officer quote- It was neat Officer noted a vapor trail. Reported as sparks in the air by Roger Mills County Sheriff's office. Sayre Sheriff's office says it's a bright light in the sky, not a meteor!, and the officers are asking if they plan to have anymore?... At 7:43PM the FAA from Oklahoma City reported it was a meteor shower. Officers replied that it was NOT a meteor, they are contacting Altus AFB for radar. About this time I made a personal observation out my back door, and I noticed a white, luminous vapor trail that went from my southwest to the northeast. There were several other trails in the area north, but they appeared normal in color. I saw no other lights or objects or aircraft in the area. At 7:53 Amarillo FAA called Sayre Sheriff's office, asking about object stated they didn't know about any meteor's, but were concerned about a possible downed aircraft.

Oklahoma fireball;2001-03-06 23:18:00;less than 1 min;Oklahoma fireball as I was leaving the parking lot at my workplace, I was traveling north, slowing up for a stop sign. I saw the cloudy sky directly in front of me turn bright blue & then I saw an orange ball travel across the sky in front of me. The object was moving from the SE to the NW. It had a long tail of yellow sparks. The sighting lasted for only a couple of seconds as it was moving very fast. Within approx 15 seconds of my sighting, I heard over my scanner one of our local police officers say Did anyone else see that? A second police officer replied That's a big affirmative The skies were very overcast last night and I felt like the blue flash was the object reflecting off the underside of the clouds.;35.4123;-99.4250000000001
