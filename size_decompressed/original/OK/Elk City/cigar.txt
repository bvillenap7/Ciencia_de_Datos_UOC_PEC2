Another sighting in Western Oklahoma;2002-01-25 06:40:00;5 minutes;Another sighting in Western Oklahoma Now I know why folks around here call this the new area 51... On 1/25/02 at 0640 Central time I was outside preparing to go to my day job in Elk City, Oklahoma, when I noticed a unusual light to my east, I would guess it was about 10 to 15 miles from me at about 10 degrees above the horizon. I would describe the object as a series of white lights lined up horizontally, similar to what Tim Edwards saw in Colorado a few years ago. The lights were flashing/strobing in a very strange way, some of the lights would flicker while others would strobe. I have never seen this type of lights before on aircraft, I'm a retired air force aero medic, and I have had many aircraft firefighting/rescue schools and I'm quite familiar with military aircraft types. I received a similar sighting report in the same area a few years ago, I have it detailed in my book, 5000 years of UFO's by America House publishing, here is a part of that report, The next evening, Thursday, February 26, 1998, Ms. H saw a huge white light just south of Clinton Lake. The light was seen near the Clinton/Sherman Air Force Base but it was at treetop level. While (she was) observing the light, it 'instantly' came forward to the edge of the tree line...and the light could be seen through the trees. It then moved up a few feet in altitude and moved over the interstate directly over her truck. It then flew along I-40 for a few seconds. By the time Ms. H reached mile marker 47, near Canute, Okla. (population 538), the mysterious light had vanished. She added, The light was so bright it illuminated the (truck's) cab. Continuing with my sighting, the object appeared to be moving very, very slowly to the south. I watched the object as I got into my vehicle and moved to a better viewing spot. I also turned on my radios, (I'm a ham radio operator, KA5UFO), and tuned to the Clinton-Sherman ATC tower frequency, 119.6 along with the local airport channel, 122.8, hoping to hear the aircraft talking to the tower. No luck, then I remembered that the CSA field is closed to air traffic until 7 am. This helped me to rule out an aircraft. It wasn't a star, planet, weather balloon, blimp, or swamp gas. This object was in my sight for about 5 minutes when it appeared to make a fast turn to the east, and the lights winked out and it disappeared within 5 seconds. I saw no other aircraft in the area.
