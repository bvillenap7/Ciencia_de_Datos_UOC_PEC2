Cylindrical object moving against the wind, no visible control surfaces;2019-08-19 16:35:00;<1 minute;Cylindrical object moving against the wind, no visible control surfaces Monday August 19. Around 4:35 p.m. Saw a cylindrical object just east of Tonkawa, OK flying north to south.  Object appeared to be like an aircraft fuselage but without wings or tail fin. As I observed the object move to the south I got a view down it as well, still showing no wings.  The object was grey a little reflectivity but not much.  Altitude would be a guess but Iâ€™d say under 10k ft.  Speeds appeared like an airliner would have. No contrail, no noise.  Could have been a balloon but it would have been trucking it on a calm wind day.  Winds were from the south as well.;36.6844;-97.2985
