The five of us were returning a rental truck to lawton, we started our journey from Anadarko. We were following the rental truck, a co-worker and I were on a 58 belair, a classic, and in great shape, it was warm that night, I remember that, the windows were rolled down, anyway, we were following the truck, when we decided to pull off to get a coke. The other party kept going, we took maybe 8 minutes or so, before getting back on the road. We were traveling about 80 mph when looking forward and to our left, we noticed what appeared to be two cars chasing each other traveling perpendicular to our path. We continued our descent into the small valley, we continued to watch the cars chase. As we started our ascend up to the top, it appeared the cars would crash into us. My partner yelled hit the brakes we lost control temporarily of the car, but managed to get control back. As I looked right, I could see him pressed up againt the windsheild, staring at the object. The ship stopped, and raised up about twenty feet above us. I glanced up and seen what appeared and very prevalent to be a battleship. The warship was jet black, with red symbols all over it. The image that sticks in my mind is that of the television show battlestar galatica. It looked like a battlestar minus the downward fins it dragged. The ship was heavily armored, but did not have any turrets or missles on it. One thing I could feel from the ship it was a battlecruiser. I glanced forward up the road, I noticed no sound at all with the exception of the car. Then as I looked ahead the entire area lit up bright orange as if it was daylight. I looked up at the ship again, it was there hovering, then it just went straight up, so quickly it reminded me of Star Trek, when the enterprise goes into warp, it looked like that. It disappeared. I now know why the government has been hiding the existence of UFO's, There are many wars going on around us, we know noth! ing of t hem. That battlecruiser was here observing missle launches going on at lawton. It was not a saucer or cigar, or anything like that, this was a battleship, why would they send a battleship? We need to ((three words deleted))  together!!!!;34.6141102040817;-98.4120775510205
Quiet blue triangular object blocked the rain before revealing itself to us.;2001-08-15 03:00:00;2 minutes;Quiet blue triangular object blocked the rain before revealing itself to us. About 15 years ago at apx. 2-3 am in the Wichita Mountain Range north of Lawton Oklahoma, while goofing off with friends at a camp site, we all stretched out on the large cement picnic tables around our campsite.  It then began to rain. It was odd because I clearly remember hearing the fat drops landing on the ground clutter and foliage around us in a full 360 degrees, however not a drop had fallen on me and none of my friends reacted as if they were getting rained on.  Even more bizarre, as we had just been acting foolish and giggling like school girls before the rain came in, all of us had grown completely silent. At this time, it felt as if about 2 to 3 mins had passed, when directly above us where there had been black sky and stars, appeared a large triangular shaped object, closer to a Pontiac logo or Star Trek emblem, with notch inset on one of the 3 sides. It faintly glowed of a pale blue hue, and I could not make out any fine detail.  It seemed to be resting stationary just about 20-30 feet above the clearing in the trees, and as the slab of the camp site occupied about 20 x 20 sq ft. I can only estimate the size of the object to roughly 30-50 ft from the front to the tips of the rear and about 15-25 ft. from tip to tip on the rear  What stands out to me the most, is that after about 20-30 secs of processing what I was seeing, at almost the exact same time 3 of us uttered phases that amounted to, do you...? ummm? and Anybody else...?.  Then, as if it heard us, the object flew away. I use quotes there because it was so fast it could have just vanished, but I seem to recall a split second where it seemed to move forward before leaving my sight.  At that exact moment we were soaked by the heavy rain we had just been listening to all around us. The object never made a sound.  I remember in the silence feeling a kind of calm come over me, and after the event we even discussed how after seeing this this we all sat motionless in silence instead of freaking out at the sight. I am an airforce brat, my father served almost 30 years combined active duty and civil service after retirement, and have lived on or near air fields my whole life.  Even today, I literally live less than 2 miles from an airbase.  I KNOW AIRCRAFT. this was not ANY type of aircraft I have ever seen.

2 crescent shaped lights moving and changing into rockets with red flames, and no white streaks behind them.;2003-11-16 17:30:00;about 30 mins;2 crescent shaped lights moving and changing into rockets with red flames, and no white streaks behind them. At about 5:30 PM,  I was driving into Duncan, Oklahoma in Stephens County, heading straight west on Highway 7.  The sun was setting, already below the horizon.  Looking north of the setting sun, were two crescent shaped lights.  fairly large, with the convex pointing down.  As I watched, the two lights got closer together.  I made a turn and lost sight of lights.  When I turned west again, at about 5:37 PM, one light had turned around, changed shape into what looked like a rocket heading straight down towards Earth and the other craft.  But there was no white streak behind it, and red flames coming from the back of the craft.  (the red flame looked like magnesium burning, color-wise).   Then  as I watched, at about 5:40 PM, the second craft (which kept its crescent shape, and was stationary until now) changed into a rocket (also with no white streak behind it, and a red-magnesium burning flame) and headed straight up into the sky away from the other craft.  these two flight paths continued until about 5:50 PM, when the second craft disappeared from view and the first craft changed its course to run parallel with the horizon.  By 5:55 PM,  the first craft had moved back up into the sky, and changed into a stationary bright light, looked like a star.  Except that where it was stationary at, the sky was still light, not dark enough to see stars yet.  By 6:20 PM, when I reached Lawton, Oklahoma, Comanche County, the light was still stationary, the sun had set completely, and I stopped watching.;34.6141102040817;-98.4120775510205
V-shaped object dragging a tail behind it!;2015-01-21 17:45:00;5-10 minutes;V-shaped object dragging a tail behind it! I went outside to watch the sunset around 5:45 PM on 1.21.2015.  When I could see from the distance what at first looked like a cloud.  But it was shaped like in a v shape and was dragging a tail behind it.  It moved very very slow.   I took some pictures and also 3 short videos.  I am not sure if it was a U.F.O or a meteor.   There was plenty of planes that flew by and you could see the difference in both objects. This object did not look like a plane at all.;34.6141102040817;-98.4120775510205
