Very light blue flame heading towards the ground.;2014-01-12 00:56:00;5 seconds;Very light blue flame heading towards the ground. It did not appear to be a craft, but it did look somewhat like a comet.   The only reason why I am reporting this is because this comet looked much larger than the average one and it looked like it was heading towards the ground just North of Lawton.   It had a very light blue sort of flame surrounding it, and was almost completely white in appearance. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
