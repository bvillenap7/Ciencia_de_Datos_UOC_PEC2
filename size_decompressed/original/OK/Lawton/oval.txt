Bright shiny craft seen over Oklahoma mountains.;2019-06-12 11:30:00;30 seconds;Bright shiny craft seen over Oklahoma mountains. My daughter and myself were walking the trail at the park mid day.  We were headed east when we saw a bright flash to the north over the mountains on Ft. Sill.  The thing was oval, bright yellow,  and super shiny.  It was almost holographic in its brightness.  We watched it travel from about 100 feet off the ground all the way above the skyline and higher.  Then it disappeared.  We waited a few minutes scanning the sky but it never reappeared.;34.6141102040817;-98.4120775510205
