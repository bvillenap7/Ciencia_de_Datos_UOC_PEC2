Large triangular object flying over military base.;2008-10-20 23:12:00;4 seconds;Large Triangler object flying over military base. I was at Ft. Sill during Basic Training.  I was patrolling outside of our tent at night when something told me to look up.   When I looked up, I saw a triangle-shaped object which blocked out the stars.  It had a light glowing orange circle and each corner of its shape.  It moved silently overhead and was massive.   It flew over the mountain close by Ft. Sill and was close to the same size.   It looked to me that the military was reacting since i saw multiple aircraft soon after it left.;34.6141102040817;-98.4120775510205
V-shaped aircraft with bright white lights and little colored lights.;2013-12-10 18:30:00;3 minutes;v shaped aircraft with bright white lights and little colored lights I was driving east on hwy 7 passing kswo news station.  I saw this bright light coming towards me.  Hwy 7 is a four lane hwy and people are going home from work so the hwy was packed.  The car in front of me slowed down and pulled over and i was passing trail road and the plane got closer and the closer it got it was v shapes almost like the top of a triangle I thought it was a stealth plane the army uses and it had two huge bright white lights and it almost came to a complete stop in midair I could see all the lights and it slowly moved southwest towards kswo.  I know all the people traveling on the road saw it.;34.6141102040817;-98.4120775510205

Then we saw the others. They took turns very vastly zooming back and forth for about 2 minutes when we saw one of them come to a complete stop, shoot straight up, and then they were gone. They sounded very loud like helicopters but very noticably were not. Had flashing lights that kind of remind you of police lights one light was red and the other was either blue or white. The trip made was roughly 50 miles each way, and only took about 4 or 5 seconds to make the round trip.;34.6141102040817;-98.4120775510205
