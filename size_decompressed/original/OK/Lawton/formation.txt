Lawton UFO;2002-03-10 01:30:00;1-3 min;Lawton UFO Object Photographed near Lawton, Oklahoma on 3/10/02 I took the attached picture from my house on the west edge of Lawton just minutes ago. I was returning from some late night shopping at the local Wal-Mart and noticed these objects in the distance moving around the sky rather erratically. When I got closer to home I realized these objects were moving in my direction so when I got home I ran inside and grabbed my digital camera. When I ran back outside the objects were nearly overhead. I snapped only one picture before they sped out of sight. There's really not much more to add.  I only got to see them up close for a very short period of time.  I don't know if anyone else saw them at the wee hours of the morning when this happened, but it sure had all the dogs in the neighborhood barking for awhile!  I just wish I had been able to get more than one picture.  I just got the digital camera a few days ago and am not real familar with it yet.;34.6141102040817;-98.4120775510205
Linear light formation traveling east.  ((Starlink satellites??);2020-04-28 21:45:00;5 minutes;Linear light formation traveling east. Linear light formation of 20. It started at just 3 lights moving east across the sky with 17 additional light appearing following the formation with a distinct gap between the 5th and the 6th. Started disappearing one by one in the same spot in order. Seemed flying closer than the stars. Brighter than the normal satellites.;34.6141102040817;-98.4120775510205
