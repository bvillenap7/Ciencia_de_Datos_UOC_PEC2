I looked up towards the sky it is a pretty clear night and I saw a green and bluish orb of light circular shaped appear just above the tree line and fall in an exact straight line down behind the free line where I cldnt see it anymore.  It didn't make any noise that I could hear, but it did seem to change colors and have hints of red and orange specs on the outer parts of the circle shape while descending down.  My friend did not see it.  Also the tree line is just across the street from me but not a true gage of distance I would say the object was farther away by a few miles as my best guess..

There was a lot of clouds in the sky, when I notice way up a black round object fly by really fast.   I stood there and watched it for a little to make sure it was not a bird.   And it did not behave like a bird.  There were several birds in the sky and you could tell that they were birds, the way they behaved.   So I ran inside to grab my camera so I could record it.  But by the time I got back outside it was gone.;34.6141102040817;-98.4120775510205
