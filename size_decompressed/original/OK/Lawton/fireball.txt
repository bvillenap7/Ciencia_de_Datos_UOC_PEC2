I was sitting in the backyard relaxing and enjoying the clear warm night and all the beautiful stars. I live in a large city and very seldom see the beauty of the universe.  I was just about to go inside when I looked directly above me and saw a blue-green fluorescent-like ball with a thick orange tail (fanning out and not extremely long) of what appeared to be sparks.  It was traveling south or southeast and disappeared over the house.  There was no sound and I would estimate that it was at an altitude of a low-flying plane.;34.6141102040817;-98.4120775510205
