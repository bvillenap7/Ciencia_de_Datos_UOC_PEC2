They appeared to be in a rectangle form object. It was moving slow to the south/southeast. The lights didnt flash or blink. The space inbetween the circles of light were dark. I tend to think about this alot because thats when there were reports of large herds of cattle missing. There were no sounds and i couldnt tell the distance away.

Satellite-like object over Lawton, OK, June 6th 2005;2005-06-06 22:20:00;30 Seconds;Satellite-like object over Lawton, OK, June 6th 2005 Anyone who knows me will know I'm the yeah righ, I'll believe it when I see it type... but last night, honestly, I saw it  Now before we go any further, I have to say I don't think it was aliens but I'll explain why at the bottom.  I was outside with my telescope at around 10:20pm... a nearby neighbour has a tree to the east and I was just lining up my scope with the Hercules Cluster (low in the north-east) when I glanced a rapidly moving bright light (about the same brightness as the star Arcturus) moving along the top of the tree.  It looked like a bright meteor so I stopped and looked up. It had stopped moving though, it was just sitting there. After a few moments it shot forward again, to the north, then stopped and shot forward again at a dead right angle to the east before vanishing about a second later.  It had a white and red light. I think both were flashing on and off but not like an airplane. It was more like the lights were fading in and out over a few seconds.  Now, Lawton is right next to Fort Sill, which is the US Army's main training ground with field artillery. (I think they test stuff here too, but I'd have to ask Deja) There are numerous air force bases around. On top of this, we've seen a stealth bomber moving silently (and very eerily) overhead so I'm under no illusions - this was the DoD playing with their toys.  What I found equally interesting was that, ten minutes later, as I was packing up, an unmarked helicopter passed fairly low nearby… ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Two sightings - 4 UFO's - 10 minutes apart - It was amazing!!!;2008-10-26 01:45:00;10 sec. each;Two sightings - 4 UFO's - 10 minutes apart - It was amazing!!! Okay, here’s the deal. I’ve always wanted to see a UFO and tonight I got the chance to see 4!! I’ve seen things in the past that were questionable. But in my mind I could never say for sure. Tonight I finally have no doubts!! The first sighting occurred around 1:30 am and it was one UFO (strobe like) flashing across the sky heading in a slight southwest direction (a lot more west than south). At first I thought it was a shooting star, but it never burned out as I watched it fly from east to west. As it was dawning on me what I was seeing, it then quickly changed directions and turned around and flew south east kind of like what a fish would look like in water. Needless to say, I was stoked (still am)!! About 10 minutes after as I was about to head in, I saw three more headed in the same direction flying in formation. Right before they would have been out of sight I saw both side UFO’s split up left and right at the same time with the middle one flying straight. It was truly amazing!! I know what I saw was not birds or jets because they made no sound and flew way too fast (8 seconds across the sky). I don’t know star formations, but all four (both sightings) flew between the 3 straight up and down stars, and the cluster of stars (4 total I think) with one in the middle. So yeah, I’m very stoked!!! Finally after 33 years of being on this earth, I got to see it with no doubts in my mind, no one can ever take that away from me!!! Thanks for putting this sight up!!;34.6141102040817;-98.4120775510205
