I was very intrigued by this sighting because it was unlike any other.   I'll start out with the color if the light.  It was a very bright yellowish or amber color.  It would increasingly get brighter and fade out.  It would be about 10 second intervals and then light back up again.  This occurred for 10 minutes. I can tell you that it is not a plane or helicopter.  First of all, the light was vast.  I have seen many planes fly behind my house and their beacons and strobes are green and red like most all planes.  It would also stop in the air for about 15 seconds and then continue its circular pattern.  It was also right over this field in the country.  I would estimate about 2-3 miles out due NNE. I would also say that it was 10 degrees above the horizon.  It made no noise so it definitively was not a plane or helicopter.  I hope you guys look in to this.  Thanks for believing.  I am sure that there is life out there as much as you guys do.;34.6141102040817;-98.4120775510205
St. Patrick's Day U.F.O. sighting in Lawton, OK;2011-03-17 20:25:00;5-10 seconds;St. Patrick's Day U.F.O. sighting in Lawton, OK I witnessed a bright white light traveling through the (north-eastern) sky behind my back yard. It appeared to be slightly smaller in diameter than that of a pencil eraser when held at arm's length.  The object moved smoothly and in a fluid like motion through a J shape arc and then stopped momentarily continuing on with a quick start into a sort of S shaped arc before blinking out of visability.  It appeared to be flying at a fairly high altitude above the low lying scant cloud cover and its speed seemed to be about twice as fast as a conventional commercial aircraft.  It should be noted that not far from the location of observation is a rather sizable and active Army base, (Fort Sill.)  We routinely witness unique displays of military air transport (hundreds of black helicopters and fighter jets, as well as orange and yellow flares.)  This object did not appear to be a flare, or a military or civilain aircraft.;34.6141102040817;-98.4120775510205

It seemed to have been falling, then disappeared.   We saw it a second time a few minutes later it did the same thing, except this time, it fell into the trees and made a burst of light.;34.6141102040817;-98.4120775510205
