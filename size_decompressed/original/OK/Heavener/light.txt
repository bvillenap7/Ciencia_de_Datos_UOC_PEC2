I started to point out what I thought was a falling star at the same time as my friend was asking me if I saw the light. We quickly realized it was not shooting star it appeared to stay stationary for about 30 seconds, then the light appeared to accelerate toward the ground and vanished.  This light/object was very large, We saw planes shortly after, and the lights on planes at a mile away were just tiny flecks of light compared to the object we witnessed;34.8355;-94.6196
