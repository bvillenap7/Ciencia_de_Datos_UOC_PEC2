This event caught my eye.  It was so bright, and colorful, it was amazing.  It was approximately seen at an azimuth of 181 degrees and approximately a zenith angle of 50 degrees (with 180 being to the center of the earth).  It looked to be the size of a number 2 pencil eraser.  I observed blue, red, yellow, and white flames around it.  You could actually see the tips of the flames.  It streaked from west to east, but probably was actually coming at me from south to north.  My only guess is that it was either a meteorite, or an aircraft exploding and completely burning up before my eyes.;34.8355;-94.6196
