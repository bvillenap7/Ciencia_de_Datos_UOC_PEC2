Possible U.F.O. sighting over lake in Canton, Oklahoma.;2003-06-15 23:00:00;15 sec;Possible U.F.O. sighting over lake in Canton, Oklahoma. It was near midnight over the lake.  My younger brother and my self were down by the water, and we were talking and looking at the stars, when I noticed a green diamond shaped something.  It was clearly in the atmosphere but so far off that it was like looking at a star.  It glowed so bright and beautiful that it could not have been a star.  The green looked almost like you could touch it, like it was living.  I swear on everything this is not a joke.  In almost no time it was gone. I looked over to ask my brother if he seen it also and he said yeah, and in that moment, I looked back to where I saw it and it was gone. My brother never looked away, and when I asked him where it went, all he said was its gone, it’s gone. The first thing we both declared before we even debated it was I think that was a U.F.O.  We never told anyone but he will vouch for what we saw with out a doubt. I swear though, we forgot as soon as we walked away from that spot, because to this day, we didn’t go back to camp and say a word to anyone, not because we where afraid.  It was as if it hadn’t happened.  You don’t forget the adrenaline rush or excitement from the experience though.  I am not sure what it was but it was there and ill never forget.
