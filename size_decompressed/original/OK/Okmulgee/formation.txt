3 lights in formation flying south.;2013-11-01 01:35:00;5 seconds;3 lights in formation flying south. Was out smoking looking at stars before bed like i normally do. (in off chance i get to see a supernova). Looking west from OSU campus i seen 3 objects flying straight south. At first i thought it was birds but the speed was way to fast and constant. (was over 2x the speed of a commercial passenger plane) Also thought it might be some airplane but the shape of the formation, speed, and zero noise.   While flying straight south 2 of 3 lights (more like glow) where on the west side of formation like a triangle pointing east but its flying south.;35.6305;-95.9665
