Thats when I saw 4 lights on one side then 3 on the other.Saw the shape of it huge triangle shape as big as a football field.Then it put those lights on me like a flash from a camera (twice).I was like why is this craft so low on this windy night?Then in my thoughts I was like this is not making a sound.It was huge!! and very low to ground.It had me if it wanted me.So I wasnt scared at that point. So I tried to get closer,got in my truck to get a better look.Took my eye off of it for a couple of seconds and it was gone. Not a sound, beem of light, nothing. Ive lived her for over 30 years and I have never seen anything like this.Before or after. I wwent and got a girlfriend after that and to my disappointment it never come bac! k.People thing Im crazy but now I always have a camera.Started to call airport but didnt.Told many people but without witness and footage no one believes me. So just thought I would tell what I saw.;35.6305;-95.9665
