Sighting of the same mile long object that was witnessed by many in Texas. on Jan. 8, 2008;2008-01-09 18:30:00;5 minutes;Sighting of the same mile long object that was witnessed by many in Texas. on Jan. 8, 2008 1. I (age 59) and my adult daughter and her boyfriend witnessed the same 1 mile long UFO, on January 9, 2008. It was about 6.30 pm, and the sky was already dark. I noticed a few aircraft in the sky, and then 2 cluster of lights, one cluster far behind the first one, but in identical path and following at identical speed. Then I realized that, even though the lights were far away, that it was one very large object, since it took up nearly one third of the sky. It wasn't going very fast, maybe 50 miles per hr. yet, at that height, while maybe only 1000 ft. up, it may have been going faster. It took about 5 minutes to go from the SE to the NW, and that was the precise direction.  2. The curious thing is that while I didn't see any aircraft around it, there was maybe 9 or 10 aircraft in the sky, about 10 minutes later (I had went inside for about that long). These aircraft were going in various directions, as if searching for the object (as if they could miss it -lol). Then the following day, there was nearly as many jets in the sky, -all producing contrails- and all day long. This was near Okmulgee, Oklahoma.  3. I didn't consider reporting this until I saw the news article at the coast the coast website, in reference to the West Texas sightings. I had hoped that more Oklahomans would have reported this. I had saw two ufos many years ago, around 1983, at nite, about 30 miles west of Okmulgee. These were similiar to other reported objects, which traveled and then stop at the same time, and then shot off in opposite directions, going extremely fast, leaving long smoke trails. I was a total non-believer until I saw these objects. I haven't actively sought seeing such objects, and didn't think I would see another ufo, especially one that was at least 1 mile long. And curiously, though I was in awe of the object, I did not have any fear (though I cannot say the same for my daughter's boyfriend). I had hear about a very large object being seen by others, while listening to coast to coast. As well as the TV report of the large object in Phoenix several years ago. (I had wanted to see such an object, but very much doubted that I would. So this was a major surprise, as well as a wish fulfilled. And while I realize that psychologically, some would say that I subconsiously sought such, the fact that many others in Texas also saw the object confirms that this was not psychologically based. As well as my daughter and her boyfriend seeing such.)  4. And though I have told some people about these 2 incidents, I haven't had any experiences that have been disturbing. I do not seek to investigate such phenomena. I prefer to think of the ufos as being explainable, viz. part of the earth, or some advanced technology by human geniuses, or natural esoteric realities, such as angels and ghosts. Some relatives have seen the ufos that dance in the nite sky (while vacationing in northern Arizona), though possibly these may be remote controlled objects, or some intelligent phasma. They had not seen any unusual objects until recent years. To be sure, I have been a non-drinker all my life, and have never been on drugs. Nor have those relatives done so. Curiously, I would say that only 1 out of every 5 people are willing to talk about such, even after 5 persons have seen such objects, at the same time.  Again, I hope there are more reports of this particular object, and detailed descriptions ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
