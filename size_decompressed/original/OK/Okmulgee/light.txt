bright light seen in the north going from west to east;2008-09-29 19:45:00;about 1 min.;bright light seen in the north going from west to east I have witnessed in the past and recently lights in the sky that I know are not planes and are not satillites because they do not always move in a straight line. One that I saw one night a few years ago made a zig zag pattern in the sky and then seem to burst into flames and had a smoke trail behind it.One night one of these lights stopped overhead and seemed to get bigger as if it were getting closer,then it all of a sudden swept away very quickly.The one I saw tonight was just a bright light speeding across the sky.;35.6305;-95.9665
