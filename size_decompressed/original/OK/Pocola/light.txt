Stationary light in the sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Jupiter and/or Venus, we suspect.  PD));2012-02-25 20:14:00;2 Hours;Stationary light in the sky Today and for 3 days prior, myself and other witnesses have observed what at first appears to be a bright star.  After stopping to focus on this, the object whatever it may be has a beam of light that shines and goes from side to side very slowly almost like a light house.  There is also a blinking light on this same object.  The object is stationary and is in the same position at least it has been since I began observing.  The longest it has stayed in the sky is around 3 hours. After that time, it is no longer visible. ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Jupiter and/or Venus, we suspect.  PD));35.2398;-94.476
