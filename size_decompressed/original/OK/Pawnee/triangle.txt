I was taking my two friends home who live in the country between Pawnee and Glencoe.   When we saw it hovering about 30 feet of the ground. It was heading straight up the road toward us.   I stopped my moms car and we got out and look at it.   It was only about 50 foot northwest of us and still hovering just of the ground.   We could hear no sounds coming from the craft. We jumped back into the car and hauled ((one word deleted)) out of there.;36.3374;-96.7965
