Very bright lights I run a local family business and am a father of three.   Wednesday, April 1, 2015, it was a nice evening, the sky was clear.  I was unloading my truck and noticed an airplane in the west, then another airplane.  I noticed how close they were in the sky.  The airplane was very distinctive with blinking red & green lights the object above had bright white lights (not blinking).  The bright object then made a quick turn (similar to a u turn) in the sky.    Then it sat there and hovered.    We live three blocks from local hospital, the object sounded very similar to life flight helicopter however it was higher up in sky and never descended to life flight pad.  It hovered in same location for 30 â€“ 45 minutes, since it had caught my interest I sat on my front porch to watch it.    As it hovered, it no longer made the loud sound that first caught my attention.   I went inside to get my binoculars, rifle spotting scope with tripod.  My son came out with me,  We located the bright object in the sky and we both thought it was peculiar and no longer believed it to be a helicopter or plane it appeared to be three or four objects clustered together in a triangular formation.      We stepped inside for a minute, when we went back outside it was gone.  The sky was still clear stars were out, no clouds just as it had been before seeing unidentified objects.   Entire duration from first seeing the object until it was gone was around 45 minutes.;35.8235;-96.374
