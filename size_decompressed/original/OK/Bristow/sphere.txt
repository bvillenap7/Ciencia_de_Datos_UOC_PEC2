Illuminated spheres moving through the sky at consistent speeds moving in all directions.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible satellites?  PD));2012-05-23 21:30:00;2 hours;illuminated spheres moving through the sky at consistent speeds moving in all directions Ok so here is the event that happend, we were out side just star gazing and noticed spheres just one at a time and sometimes two going in all directions.  The sphere shapes were very high in the sky almost looked like moving stars at a consistent speed... fast.  This was not like a shooting star where when the shooting leaves a strip of light behind.   Today's date is 5/24/12 and we are still seeing these objects in the sky and have seen these many times before but not as many as now.  And we seen two stop and shoot off like warp speed or somthing.  And there is no way these can be planes, to high and no blinking lights on these objects.  We thought maybe satellites until we noticed they were moving in all directions. and creek me if I'm wrong satellites move in the orbit of earth. it would be awesome to see somebody investigate this thanks anonymous.;35.8235;-96.374
