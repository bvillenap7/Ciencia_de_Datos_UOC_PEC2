First saw 14 lights at 10k ft moving in a steady straight line. Ten minutes later there were many more in following a similar path all in line. I couldn't see where the lights originated through the trees but they vanished over the lake to the east. They traveled like the speed of satellites in the night sky, but were much closer. Soundless. My phone went to emergency only mode during the parade of lights and stayed in emergency mode for an hour after.;36.5963;-94.7563
