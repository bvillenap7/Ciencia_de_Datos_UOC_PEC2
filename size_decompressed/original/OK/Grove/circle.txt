I got up to let my dog out and noticed a bright light in the east.  My house is on the lake and I have a clear view to the east.   My wife was awake and when I pointed out the light, she said it was probably a planet.  My binoculars are always by the large window and thru them I could see not one light, but a row of lights (5), with the brightest in the middle.   She came and looked and saw exctly what I saw.  The lights were stationary and over the next two hours, moved very slowly up and to the south. This had to be a very large object, because we could see the space between the lights.  The sides of the object had a cone of light going out on both sides, so I believe the lights when around the object.;36.5963;-94.7563

When I did, I saw a bright, orange circle floating in the sky that was flying back and forth, going behind a tree and coming back out.   After a couple minutes, and videos later, it flew up and disappeared.;36.5963;-94.7563
