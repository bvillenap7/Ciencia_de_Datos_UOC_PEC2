2 large orange lights in Yukon sky;2016-07-18 21:30:00;~2 minutes;2 large orange lights in Yukon sky Driving home, I saw 2 large orange balls in the sky.  At first I thought something was on fire. I tried to take a picture when it was obvious it wasn't a plane.  Didn't get a very good picture.  When I got home, my boyfriend and I went in the backyard looking for the lights and after a few minutes we saw one.  There was no sound and it seemed to be flying straight.;35.4971;-97.7330000000001
It was a clear night, with no clouds in the sky;2020-03-25 23:05:00;3 minutes;It was a clear night, with no clouds in the sky My husband and I were traveling westbound, on a back country road, making a food delivery to a customer. Off to our left side, my husband noticed 2 very bright white lights initially trailing after each other. When he mentioned it to me, I dismissed him and said itâ€™s just airplanes. Then, both white lights came to a dead stop in the sky. We both watched the first light turn blue (it was ahead of the other light behind it). We both started to feel uneasy and anxious. Then the one behind it took off in the opposite direction ( heading south west) at a very fast rate of speed, while the first one began moving in our direction. It changed back to a white light and appeared to stop over our vehicle. In that moment we lost our radio reception. It turned to absolute static. It hovered above us for what seemed like forever, in reality was more like 1 minute. There was no sound to it. After about 1 minute of hovering, it took off heading northeast at a high rate of s! peed. We eventually lost it, as it just vanished. We looked back to the south west and the 2nd white light had vanished as well. Once the one that hovered over our vehicle took off, we got our radio reception back.;35.4971;-97.7330000000001
