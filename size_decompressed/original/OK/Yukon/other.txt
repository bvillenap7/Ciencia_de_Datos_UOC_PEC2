As;2004-08-16 20:15:00;seconds;Object was first sighted traveling in a Northerly direction & would have been West of Will Rogers World Airport in Okla. City, Okla. As it approached my location at an estimated 5000ft. I could hear no sound, and it was moving fairly fast> To me it appeared to be a dark color & had shape I have never seen before> It looked, as best as I can describe it as having 5 half-circles all round in shape and connected> It kept it's Northerly direction, and I went inside, got the phone and tried to call Wiley Post Airport but got no answer> Called local TV station & they had had no other reports, called Ok City Police Dept. and they had no reports> I have flown a lot, was in the Air Force, and have been employed by the Federal Aviation Agency, but I have never seen anything like this!! There was a local hot air baloon show in the area this weekend, and I thought possibly some one may have been trying out something experimental, but I have never seen a baloon travel this fast!!;35.4971;-97.7330000000001
