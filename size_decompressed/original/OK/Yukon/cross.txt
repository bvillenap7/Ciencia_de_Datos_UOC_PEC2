It looked like a bright diamond with a cross;2001-08-19 23:45:00;5 minutes;It looked like a bright diamond with a cross I was driving east on Hwy 152 late Sunday night when I saw what appeared to be a light coming towards me in the distance. The light was white and I thought it may be a motorcycle. As it approached from the East towards my car it began to change in shape.It became very bright and seemed to look like a bright cross with a diamond.It came within 40 yards of my car then it seemed to just disappear.I pulled over a bit because I still thought a vehicle might be heading towards me.Nothing ever passed my car and I never heard a sound of any kind from the object.;35.4971;-97.7330000000001
