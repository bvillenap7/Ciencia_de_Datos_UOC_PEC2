When walking outside we saw a boat looking object speeding across the sky.  It had a very strange orange glow to it and upon focusing on it it had three large flames burning on it. Once it was noticed another object exactly like the first but much closer also came speeding across the sky.  It too was boat shaped and had three large flames burning on what would be like the “deck.”  Although there were flames coming from it they weren’t on fire because they continued to fly until out of site traveling from West to East. The bizarre thing was the three flames coming off the objects were almost cartoon like.  They each maintained a single flame like shape which never varied and they all put off a huge orange glow which was consistent and did not flicker. It was not a meteor or firework as they did not have a downward trajectory nor did they make a sound.  They remained flying at the same height and maintained a forward trajectory.;35.4971;-97.7330000000001
