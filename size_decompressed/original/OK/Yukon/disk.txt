HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Saucer hovering and slowly moving sideways a bit.;2003-09-30 00:30:00;approx: 40 seconds;Saucer hovering and slowly moving sideways a bit. Yukon, Oklahoma  Date:  September 30, 2003 Time:  11:45 to 12:30 p.m.  Hi Brian  I recently was out in my back yard with a cup of coffee, and noticed something moving then stopped and hovered for about 30 seconds, so I went back in and grabbed our Sony cybershot digital cam and got a picture of it (lower right) UFO? My wife thinks it's a plane but I told her you should have seen it's movement, It flew off really FAST and was out of sight!  I was home from work this last Tuesday , 9-30-03, the time was about 11:45 to 12:30 p.m., not quite sure. When I first noticed it, it was just hovering and slowly moving sideways a bit, just west of our house, maybe about 5-8 miles,and  I would say somewhere between 2000 to 5000 ft ?? Not sure, when I rushed back outside with my cam, it flew off after 10 or so seconds, in a north, northeast direction ( there is also a small airport in that direction too) VERY high velocity also, in a few seconds it was gone!  This is the second time I have captured something strange on film, the other time, I caught on film what looked like a B1b bomber at high altitude. but I never saved it though. If I would have thought of it at the time, I would have put the cam on record, it takes short 30 sec videos, oh well.  Thank you to the witness for allowing me to post the report and pictures.
