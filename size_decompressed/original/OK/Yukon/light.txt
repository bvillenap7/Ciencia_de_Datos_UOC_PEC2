I was watching the sunset and it was still very light outside.  A very bright “star” appeared above the horizon above the sunset and appeared to sit motionless.  I figured it was a star becoming visible, but I thought it was strange because it was so bright, it wasn't there before, and it was still very light outside.  I pointed it out to my daughter and she saw it as well.  I got some pics of the sunset, but noticed that the bright star had completely vanished.;35.4971;-97.7330000000001
