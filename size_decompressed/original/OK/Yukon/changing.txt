As we pulled our car over to take closer looks we determined that about three of those aircraft were indeed planes.  However the other four continued to change shape and disappear then reappear.  A couple were round and one was kinda like a disc but much thicker and all of the ufos were not moving at all. Then night came and they disappeared into the night.
