While lounging by the pool, my father noticed a brilliant, sphere shaped object traveling very fast from the east, headed northwest.  In comparison to plane traveling close by this object was moving much faster.  I was able to take a photograph.;35.4971;-97.7330000000001
Yellow light above treeline in the country too big to be a light or plane;2020-10-02 08:00:00;3-4 minutes;Yellow light above treeline in the country too big to be a light or plane I was taking out the trash and I saw a large yellow light above the treeline. It was way to big to be a plane or a street light. I watched it and it didnt move but about 4 minutes later it just vanished. We live in the country. This really has me freaked out.;35.4971;-97.7330000000001
