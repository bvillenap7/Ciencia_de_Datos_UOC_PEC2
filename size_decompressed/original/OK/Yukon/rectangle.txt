I was out with my new binoculars to look at the stars. I looked to the south and noticed something large, dark, and low altitude flying silently several miles away. The object had to be huge, larger than a jumbo jet. At first, I thought it was a huge flock of birds, which would have been strange at 9:30 PM, but it wasn't that. It looked brown/gray/black, not sure, but it just came so close to blending with the night sky that I wouldn't have noticed it if the night wasn't so bright and if it had not blotted out some stars as it passed.  The shape is difficult to describe.  I would say the primary portion of it was rectangular, but with protrusions at the top and bottom.  It almost looked like the silhouette of a giant gun or key.  I will submit an illustration by email.  I caught it with my binoculars and tracked it as far as I could. It was going East to West, but as a I tracked it, it veered off to the north some distance away. At one point, I did notice some very dim lights, but I thought it may be reflections from early lights as it turned.  The shape seemed different when it turned, but I don't know if it had to tilt to do that or what. At some point it was behind a house and I lost it.;35.4971;-97.7330000000001
