Now, don't take this the wrong way, I had a liitle to drink earlier in day at my dad's bbq, but by this time I was solber with a bit of a head ache.  We lit a few fire workers, my head started to really hurt, kinda like a sinus head-ache, it just keep intensifing. Well, I just thought it might be the humidity or the load popping noise from the fire works. So, I sat in the car for a bit to regroup, then I saw it, it was at a distance approx. 2 miles at first I thought it may be a helicopter, or a plane. then the object split into 3 different lights, one was a teal green, the other a purplish blue, and a flash light color(really bright) just like a helicopter spot light. It was coming up on us like a roaring semi-truck, at a height of about 150 yds above the ground. I really thought it was a Sheriff helicopter. Within 1/2 mile distance my friends, who were still funning and carring-on, stop and took notice. Then all of a sudden, it was as quiet as a whisper, nothing.....then a boom the lights split into 6 different lighted objects, the size was breath taking. We stood in ah, no one said anything, just with dum expressions. The light just hovered there for 5-6 minutes and POW the took-off in 7 different directions. One of them came right at us, passing overhead, I ((was frightened.))  I have never been that scared before in my life. So, we hopped into the car and speed out back into town. I haven't sleep in two days. My dad and I went back out there today and investigated, all we found was our tire marks and a half of mile in front of where we parked was a 4 foot diameter burn mark.;35.4575251773048;-97.5284708037825
