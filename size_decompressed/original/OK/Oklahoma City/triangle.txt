E;1993-07-01 22:00:00;4-5 minutes;2 triangle craft over OKC. 1 travled N to S. 2 traveled W to E. The craft were very high, could only see their shape with binoculars. Each had six lights down the side of the craft. I was out sky watching with binocular when I saw two lights very high and relativly close together in the sky.  It was a clear night and the visability was excellent.  I got my binoculars on the object traveling north to south first and as I was facing east the object was traveling from left to right in my field of view.  I quickly noticed approximatly 12 white or yellow lights, 6 running down each side of the craft in a V or triangular shape.  I almost could not believe what I was seeing.  There was this V shaped craft that had to be huge considering how high it was.  Without the binoculars I could have easily just passed the lights off as airline traffic.  But the craft were were large enough to easily make out the triangle shape with binoculars. Especially when I began to look at the other craft, which actually still closer to me than the one heading south. The second craft was heading east and was moving directly away from me, giving me a perfect view of the V shape.  And I would have to say that a V is a better discription of the craft than triangular because the craft seemed longer rather than wider.  Each craft proceeded in a slow steady manner and I remembered thinking how can these two ships be flying over OKC and there seemed to be no other planes up and interested in them.  I also thought that two identical craft passing each other the way they were was odd, almost like they were mapping something. I watched the two craft for 4-5 minutes before both were completly gone from view.  I wanted to call someone about the incident but never did.  I did report the sighting some months later to the local MUFON chapter but they never made a report either.;35.4575251773048;-97.5284708037825

The 3 Capitol Lights;2001-03-15 16:30:00;7 min;The 3 Capitol Lights I lived a few blocks from the capitol and I was outside getting a breather when I saw this light over the capitol. I noticed it did not have any flashing lights like normal aircraft. Then it split into 3 lights into a triangle shape. This made no noise, and moved at a stedy pace. It came over my place of living and flew off towards Tinker Air Force Base. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));35.4575251773048;-97.5284708037825

The object appeared to be in the shape of a triangle as seen in my video. It appeared to be spinning and moving to the East very slowly.  It didn't appear to have any lights but seem to be reflecting one red light.  We watched until the sun was setting and the object seemed to disapear or couldn't be seen with out the sun light.  I checked the weather on the net and found out that the wind was blowing ESE/8 miles an hour. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness briefly, and we found him to be quite credible in his description of what he had just been witness to.  His description was quite detailed and precise.

I saw what looked to be a triangular craft traveling north - northeast at a fairly high rate of speed. There weren't any sounds of aircraft. I didn't notice any lights but could see the outline of the object. I guess I was a little surprised and didn't think to move at first but, in a second or two, ran around the rail and into the yard to see if I could catch another look and I couldn't spot it. I was hesitant to report the sighting because it was such a short one and I had recently watched a program about triangular objects possibly being the stealth blimp (I thought I might just be seeing things). I am usure of the exact night and didn't have any plans of posting this, but I had been to your sight before and as an after thought decided I would check out the sightings and see if there were any recent ones in Oklahoma. You don't need to post this, I just thought it might be helpful in conjunction with the other tringular sightings reported here this month.;35.4575251773048;-97.5284708037825

I have shown this tape to many co-workers and friends who have no explanation for what I've caught on tape... Most want me to send the tape in to the news stations ...Haven't decided what to do with it.   I am 38 , have at very technical job and can't explain what I saw on may 16 ,2005 but at least I have it on tape.

Orange V shaped lights fly overhead without making a sound.;2007-08-14 01:00:00;10 Seconds;Orange V shaped lights fly overhead without making a sound. On August 14, 2007, my son and I went outside to watch the meteor shower.  We live in an apartment complex, and the surrounding lights in the complex were too overbearing to view the meteor shower.  We then walked to the street where there is no ambient light.  I was looking North-East in the direction that the meteor shower was supposed to appear.  Suddenly I saw a meteor.  My son did not see the meteor.  I directed my son in the direction that the meteor was in.  Almost immediately, we both saw this set of orange lights fly over head from North-East to South-West.  It sort of resembled 7 orange birds flying in a “V” formation.  The object made absolutely no sound!  We didn’t see it coming over the horizon, it just appeared.  Almost like the lights just came on.  We tried to follow it, but it disappeared over the South-West horizon.  But it was again almost like the lights just turned off.  Maybe you have to be directly under the object to see the lights.  I’ve seen many pictures of this type of craft before, but never in my life did I think I would actually see it myself.  It scared my son pretty bad, so we went inside and did not watch any more of the meteor shower.  I'm sure that if someone else was watching the shower that they too would have seen this craft.  Having my son with me confirmed that I was not out of my mind.;35.4575251773048;-97.5284708037825
Lights Over Oklahoma City/Edmond Area;2012-10-19 21:40:00;10 to 15 minutes;Lights Over Oklahoma City/Edmond Area I was on Waterloo Road just west of Kelly in north Edmond, Oklahoma.  I noticed six to eight lights in the southern sky hovering over the Oklahoma City area.  At first, I thought the lights were in an unconventional pattern.  However, when I got home, I drew the pattern of lights on a sheet of paper, and I noticed the next day that the pattern of the lights is similar to the Big Dipper.   I got out of my car and took three pictures with my cell phone.  The pictures are dark, and I cannot see the lights on the photos.   I got back in my car and headed south on Kelly.  I continued to clearly see the lights that were hovering in the sky.  I then noticed that three to four of the lights had moved north and were suddenly very close to me in the Edmond area (just west of Kelly).  The objects flew right over my car (to the right/west), and I watched them as I continued to drive.  At first, I thought the objects were helicopters because they appeared to be moving fa! irly slowly.  As they came closer, I realized their shape was triangular.  As they flew over, they did not make any noise.  Each object had mostly white and some red lights on the bottom.  The lights were in rows and appeared to outline the entire bottom of the object.  They continued to move north out of my view.;35.4575251773048;-97.5284708037825
Large brightly lit object plummets from the sky in NW OKC;2014-06-30 05:50:00;5 seconds;Large brightly lit object plummets from the sky in NW OKC NW OKC off NW Expressway and Penn, I saw a very brightly lit inverted triangle-shaped object plummet from the sky.  It went behind trees, but I looked intently incase something happened when it hit the ground, but saw nothing.  It's hard for me to guess size because I have no idea how close it was to me, but I observe planes in that same area of sky all the time and this was at least five times bigger than planes appear.;35.4575251773048;-97.5284708037825

A large Photographed Triangular UFO over Oklahoma City.;2019-01-19 21:00:00;45 minutes;A large Photographed Triangular UFO over Oklahoma City. A large Triangular object with three lights on each side.  You could see the actuall ship, not just the lights.  I have a  photo of it.   It hovered and stayed for 45 minutes and just completely vanished.  The strange thing is that this same UFO was spotted in 2017 in the same area.  It seems to come every 2-5 months.   It made no sound.  It was very noticeable, but nobody seemed to pay attention to it.  None of the lights blinked or turned off.;35.4575251773048;-97.5284708037825

Heard a loud sound similar to what an  aircraft would sound if it was breaking the sound barrier but when it was seen, craft was traveling at various speeds and sideways. It made drone-like movements and circled around downtown OKC but was far too large and loud for anything of the sort.;35.4575251773048;-97.5284708037825
