My husband, son and I were outside watching nearby fireworks at 10:35pm CST and from the SSE we saw a brilliant orange hovering object heading to the NNW.   We thought it was a local helicopter but as the craft approached it was silent and brilliant in color, like a burning ember.   It was not close enough to discern a clear shape, but seemed almost circular.  It flew in a very controlled manner at a consistent altitude and speed.   The speed was like that of a helicopter also.  The altitude seemed to be somewhere between 8,000 and 15,000 feet.  Difficult to really estimate the altitude because of our uncertainty of the nature of the craft.   After it had passed over us and was almost out of our vision field we noticed that the brilliance seemed to weaken just a bit, but then reappeared as it continued on its path to the NNW.   The duration of our siting was probably 1 minute, or slightly more.   We are certain it was not an airplane, nor a helicopter, nor a satell! ite or slow burning shooting star or firework.  We have never seen a flying object like this.   We do not consume alcohol, nor drugs and have excellent vision and judgement.   We are sincere in submitting this report.   Thank you. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) This is a supplemental report to my initial report, per Peter Davenport's request.    We called the local National Weather Service to obtain wind direction at the time of our siting last evening.   At 10:00pm CST the ground wind direction was approx 150-degrees or SE heading NW.    The balloon was flown at 7pm CST for higher elevation wind at 3,000 feet and it was reported at 160-degrees or SE, almost a bit SSE, heading NW.    Also, I failed to submit in my initial report that I called a local news channel this morning to see if others may have sited or reported the same thing we saw.  They said yes, they received one phone call reporting this same object at the same time we saw it.   Thank you. ((END ADDENDUM));35.4575251773048;-97.5284708037825
