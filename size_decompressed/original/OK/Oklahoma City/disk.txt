But di;1978-05-15 22:30:00;45 minutes;SW 15th & Indiana okc ok  Quiet, steel flying saucer shaped vehicle flew to me and friend. It came from North. Flew South to us. But didn't seem to come from miles and miles away. .....  Seemed like it just came into our view from another side of black sky wall.  Just came out and was in view. It approached slowly  Then in clear view about as high as  building (30-40 stories) hovered as if facing us.  And was about 2 city blocks distance north. We were its focal point. We were 15 & 18.  No alcohol or drugs ever used.  Pure, welcoming,  No fear. Curious. The night was clear, quiet.  Neighborhood asleep. We kept looking at it.  It just stayed there as if eyes on us.  Then a super bright white light beam was down on us before we knew it.  We could see the direction of beam was exactly shining on us.  But when we looked on our arms, legs each other.....there was no light. When we looked in front it was ending on us  It was not behind, or beside. It was directly from the vehicle very high intensity bright light beam. It remained exactly on us. But not visible on us. For about 45 minutes total  Then retracted. And saucer retreated backwards from where it came. Straight. Back North & before very far disappeared again like going back through a curtain . I have always joked to my children I was an alien. Higher intelligence. Not like the rest. No human attachment. Paranormal experiences with orbs, visions. Energy sillouettes. Premonitions. Clairvoyant. I just know things. And funny thing is....I haven't thought about this until a friend was speaking on the subject of UFOs last night.  It has been 40 years since I saw it at age 15. I'm 55 now. Thank you. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));35.4575251773048;-97.5284708037825
Just searching for them. Spinning at about the speed of 15 miles an hour and the diameter was about 59 feet;2003-03-06 19:32:00;About 3 minutes;Just searching for them. Spinning at about the speed of 15 miles an hour and the diameter was about 59 feet Since I do a lot of UFO searching I've only come a cross about 3 in the month. The UFO's I've spotted have the exact same detail as the last. The three I saw all had 5 lights.(about the size of a volkswagon beetle). All three also hover of the same spot the just fly straight into the air. The only thing I heard was a low humming of the engine. If there was traffic in the vescinity you wouldn't be able to hear it. I do most of my searching in the fields by an elementary school called Northridge Elementary but now they are putting up an apartment complex which makes me mad because that is where I get all of my sittings. The UFO had no bolts or seams. It looked like one piece of metal just shapped perfectly round. It didn't land but hovered about 30 to 40 feet of the ground. I have reason to believe this is the same UFO. I don't know what to do if I see it again. Should I take a picture or tape it or not even go near it. If you could send me the answers please e-mail me via internet at ((e-address deleted)). Thank you for reading this letter and I hope it is of much of help in your investigation. PS: No one believes me. This is not a hoax so please believe me or I wont know what to do;35.4575251773048;-97.5284708037825

Nearby nighttime viewing of brightly lit saucer in South Oklahoma City.;2014-01-29 23:00:00;30 seconds;Nearby nighttime viewing of brightly lit saucer in South Oklahoma City. I live near the woods at SE25th and High Street, just West of I-35 in Oklahoma City.  I walked out into my back yard around 11pm to get some firewood for the overnight, and saw a low flying craft coming from the South, just a few hundred yards away right above the treetops.  It caught my attention because it was so low and had far too many lights for an airplane, as I could see around six or so bright white lights across the leading edge.  I soon noticed it had “points” of light coming out the bottom, so I put a hand over one eye to check that it wasn’t just blurred vision from the cold night air as it came into full view, unobstructed by the trees, and it was not blurred vision –I checked both eyes as it slowly approached.  As it drew nearer, passing due North, East of my position, the bright lights were also visible down the side of the craft, just as they had been from my view of the leading edge, and the “points of light” appeared to be multi-colored cones of light, three or four of them, coming from the bottom of the craft like a cone, with the point downward.  I continued to watch it pass at a few hundred yards away in the pitch black sky, and believe it was a saucer shape with large bright white lights surrounding the outer edge, the “points of light” pointing from the flat bottom center of the craft at a length of ten or twelve feet toward the ground.  From the rear of the craft I could see flashing lights in various places on the craft –none of which behaved like airplane lights, nor were they properly colored –just white lights. I believe it to have been a typical “flying saucer shape” like two tea cup saucers stacked together, possibly with a spacer in between, where the large bright white lights would have been.  I would estimate it to have been about thirty feet across. It flew absolutely silently.  Moved much too fast to be a blimp, but seemed to merely float in the sky, silently, slower than an airplane, but crossed my field of vision inside of thirty seconds, covering probably a mile or so before my view became obscured by buildings and trees in my  own yard.  This thing was close by, and not the first unusual craft I have seen appear to come from these woods over the many years of living here. ((ADDENDA FROM WITNESS)) 1.  Oh, yes -the 29th would be the correct date. I just glanced down at the corner of my screen for the date.I just saw the thing -so -adrenaline! 2.  I would also like to let you know that the multi-colored cones of light were shades of blues and greens. ((END ADDENDA));35.4575251773048;-97.5284708037825

There where 3 smaller ones and one huge one...   It was so big but so high in the sky it had to have been the size of 5 plans put together..  We followed these crafts for probably 50 miles on I40 west..   Not once even getting close to them but other small blue lights where also chasing them..   As the sun set we lost sight of them.;35.4575251773048;-97.5284708037825
