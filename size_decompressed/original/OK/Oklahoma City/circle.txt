Oklahoma City UFO;2004-03-15 19:00:00;10 minutes;Oklahoma City UFO While driving on the turnpike from Oklahoma City, I saw one bright star in the sky right in front of me. After about a minute, it grew really really bright and then tappered down while flickering a bit. This happened three times in about 10 minutes and I knew this was not a star. I eventually found myself passing almost beneath it, for it hovered right off the highway. I noticed the elevation was maybe twice as high as a communications tower. It wasn't an airplane, helicopter, or hot air baloon. I couldn't quite get a distint shape but their were light on it. one white light and 2 red lights. I passed it and thought I should pull over on the shoulder to watch it but I didn't because of all the cars around me. I wish I had. This is my second UFO sighting. The date is probably a little off. It happened about a month ago.;35.4575251773048;-97.5284708037825
Two hovering orange circles drop third orange circle over oklahoma.;2006-04-05 22:25:00;10 minutes;Two hovering orange circles drop third orange circle over oklahoma. My girlfriend and i were driving home when both of us noticed three planes within a mile of each other directly north of our location. We both have an interest for all thing abnormal and interesting so we kept our eyes on them hoping. One of the objects did turn out to be a plane and veered off from the location while the other two orange lights remained, hovering in the air. We stopped on a very slow overpass to watch further because they had been hovering in the same place for well over a minute. We watched as one of the lights began to get brighter and brighter and slowly drifted around in mostly the same place, it just sort of floated. The second object began to slowly fade out until it was no longer visible. Just as we were fixing to start the car and leave (she had to be home by 22:30) the one still hovering seemed to have a new seperate ship drop from its side. The first ship then began to lower until it was no longer visible over the city lights and trees. After it was gone the new ship began to glow brighter and brighter just as the first did. We watched this ship hover in place for around 2 minutes until it finally began to lower and dissapeared just as the first had. All three ships were orange/yellow in color similiar to the color of a street light. They were circular and generally had very little movement probably only travelling back and forth within a miles radius. They did have some horizontal movement but like i said they always stayed within a mile of where we first sighted them. The sighting occured in Oklahoma city, OK. I have contacted the news to see if anyone else noticed them last nite. The only thing that i can possibly think of to debunk what i saw is that the location i saw them is about 45 miles west of tinker air force base which has been known to test new planes, but even still i highly doubt they would of been testing anything like what we saw.;35.4575251773048;-97.5284708037825
stationary red light viewed over Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Sirius, possibly?  PD));2008-02-21 20:30:00;1 hour;stationary red light viewed over Oklahoma City, Oklahoma At approximately 8:30 PM CST on 2/19/08, my daughter telephoned to say that she, her children and her husband were outside watching a strange object in the sky. She stated that the object was round and had a red light circling the object and a had a red light located underneath the object blinking off and on. She stated that they had watched the object stay in a stationary position in the sky for approximately 30 minutes. We discussed the various possibilities, including a helicopter, airplane, balloon, etc. All these possible explanations were rejected by my daughter and her husband. The object was about the height of an airplane coming in for a landing. The possibility of a balloon was rejected because the object started moving in a northerly direction (against the wind) and then moved back into the original position. She asked if I could see the object and when I looked out my window, there it was! I watched it also and we continued to speculate about it. It then started moving North again and then disappeared. We were wondering if anyone else in Oklahoma City saw this object and reported it. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Sirius, possibly?  PD));35.4575251773048;-97.5284708037825
Circular craft blinking red, yellow, orange, green,  blue.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible twinkling star, or celestial body, perhaps?  PD));2010-07-24 00:00:00;3 hours;Circular crafts blinking red, yellow, orange, green, and blue My husband and I had just got done watching a movie when we decided to go out to our apartments pond area.  It has a nice open space where the stars are visible with a picnic area that you can sit at.   We went out wanting to enjoy the nice weather and have a romantic ending to our night.  It was around midnight when we went, walked to the back of the pond and sat down.  We where there for aproximately 10 minutes when I looked up saw something circular blinking in the sky. The object was towards the south of us flying lower than an airplane would, and it was blinking red, green, orange, blue and yellow, something an airplane would not do.  I urged my husband to look at it, and he agreed that it was not a plane.   The object was not moving at all, as if it where hovering.  We both at the time just kind of blew it off a bit,joked about it being a UFO we lit a cigarette, and looked up and it was gone.  This is when we began to freak out and get real serious about it, realizing that we where talking about it and observing it for at least 10 minutes without it moving, and then it just disappeared. We continued to scan the sky when I noticed the same looking object to the west of us.  Appearing about 5 minutes after the other one dissapeared.  It had the same blinking colors, only the distance seemed closer, and lower than before.  We kept watching it hover in place, shift to the left and right real fast, and then at moments it would stop flashing colors and turn a yellow-orange color.  It also would get distant and then come closer.   My husband then noticed to the north another one, by this time I am really freaking out, and almost in tears because I cant believe my eyes.  My husband on the other hand excited about what he is seeing.  My husband watched the one towards the north as I watched the one to the west.  We would report back and forth to eachother what they where doing as we watched.  My UFO then shifts right then zooms left leaving a trail of light behind it then dissapears in a split second.  If i would have blinked I would have missed it! Im still not sure where it d! issapeared to. Since the UFO I was staring at had disappeared we both continued to watch my husbands, which was not moving at all.  It was just flashing red, orange, green, blue, and yellow.  I looked over in the direction where the one I was observing disappeared, and it reappeared!  They where both there in the sky again, one to the north, and one to the west.  The one that I was watching seemed as if it would get distant, and then come closer, contunuing to shift right to left and up to down.  My husbands seemed to stay in the same spot not getting closer or farther.  As we observed them seperately we would continue to report back and forth to eachother what they where doing. This all came to an end at about 2:40 p.m. when all the sudden mine turned yellow-orange, then his did too.  Then mine started blinking colors, then his did too.  Then all the sudden both of them began to get distant and higher extremely fast together(still in their seperate directions of west and north), then they both just disappeared.   We stayed until 3:00 to see if they would come back, but they didnt, so we walked to our apartment. From what we collected and witnessed, it seemed as if the two crafts where comunicating back and forth with their lights because one would blink lots of colors then turn to a yellow-orange color, then the other would do the same.   And it also seemed as if the one I was watching was on a mission, as the other one was on the lookout.   We collected this because mine was doing all the moving and his was just still. I had a very hard time getting to sleep after having experienced this.  My husband was very excited about our experience, and was releived that he now knows life on other planets exist.  He seemed pretty calm about it, but still said that he was a little freaked out.   I have never been a believer in aliens and UFOs, but I now honestly have to say, that after experiencing this, I am a believer.  Nothing could explain or justify what we saw.

Circular, bright orange object flying north in the sky that fell apart and disappeared.;2010-08-09 23:15:00;55 seconds;Circular, bright orange object flying north in the sky that fell apart and disappeared. Observers were two teenage girls about to go to college.  We were sitting in a park facing north when one of us noticed a strange light moving across the sky.  It was circular and bright orange and it was going north.  It was quite a bit larger than a star, but smaller than the moon.  It was moving faster than the plane that was going east, although we don't know how close the plane was to the object.  We saw it moving for about fifteen seconds, and then it paused in midair for about thirty seconds.  Then about a third of it broke apart and fell.  The light then disappeared.;35.4575251773048;-97.5284708037825

Huge circular craft high in the sky.;2012-02-24 13:15:00;1 min;Huge circular craft high in the sky. While at work, I went outside to smoke and noticed just an outline of one side of a cirlce moving above the clouds.  While I can't say how high it was, it was definately very high above the clouds.  It looked to be about the size that the moon would look in the sky.  I  had a bay door above my head and used it as a reference to assure that this was actually moving and that I wasn't seeing an optical illusion from the moovement of the clouds.  It was most definately moving in a northwesterly direction. And it was most definately gigantic.  I hurried to retrieve my camera from my car but it was behind the clouds by then.;35.4575251773048;-97.5284708037825

Round;2013-12-01 19:37:00;5-10 minutes;I was driving on I-35 coming from Ponca City, OK towards Norman/Oklahoma City, OK, around 7:30 pm and it was pitch black outside with a pretty thick fog, so it was nearly impossible to see any signs or landmarks...or even drive.  Myself and other cars were going around 45-55 mph due to the fog.   All of a sudden I see a bright orange-ish light, thinking it was the moon.. maybe an eclipse of some kind.  As I drove closer to the light I realized it was not the sun/moon and it had a prominent shape to it.  It was round and divided up (like a calzone looks).   The sky completely lit up bright orange!  It was so bright it looked like it was at the peak of the day. I kept driving and there were more maybe 10 altogether.   These were not moving, just stationary in the sky and I did not hear any sound coming from them.  Not blurry, not far away, VERY PROMINENT SHAPES!!!   This was around marker 170-180 (I didn't look because I was so scared at the time but it was in that range)   After driving underneath these object all of the cars proceeded to drive around 95-100+ mph out of that 'area'. I also called 911 which transferred me to highway patrol and they said they would send someone out there but seemed to have no knowledge of any projects with an aircraft like that being out there at that time.;35.4575251773048;-97.5284708037825

Glowing lights or orbs in NW Oklahoma City.;2015-12-23 22:07:00;1 minute;Glowing lights or orbs in NW Oklahoma City. December 23, 2015, at approximately 10:07 PM, l was in the area of NW Expressway and Council Rd,.  I was getting out of my car in the neighborhood and observed several glowing lights, no noise or sounds of any kind moving around in the sky.  Some moved fast, or circular motion, flickered on on off and moved in ways unexplainable.   It caught the attention of everyone in the neighborhood and we all began to film but we did not see anything on the news about any events or light shows on tv.  We though maybe the flame bag hot air things that will float up, but these moved in circles, circle in shape, moved fast , slow, backwards...every direction and angles.  The strangest thing I've ever seen. Any ideas?;35.4575251773048;-97.5284708037825

It was a Large Silver Circular object that had what looked like a dome with 2 large lights or windows.  The object flew from left to right, away from me.  It made no sound. When I first saw it I knew 100% it was not a plane or a helicopter because we have heavy air traffic directly above our house.  My first though was oh my god that was a ufo I have to report it!  The object continues its E to SE flight path until I could not longer see it because the the trees.  And I then called the hotline number.;35.4575251773048;-97.5284708037825

Flickering orb that may have been two orbs near the end.;2020-11-14 20:30:00;20;Flickering orb that may have been two orbs near the end. There was a single flashing orb. It flickered and bounced around a small area from my viewpoint. I thought it may be a plane but it clearly was not moving like a plane and the encounter was for 15-20 minutes so a plane or satellite would have been long gone in a shorter time frame. The orb continued to flicker and jump. I caught it on video and photograph. I noticed little arcs of light coming off the orb a few times. Then near the end it appeared to be two orbs. But I’m not sure if the one orb was just bouncing that fast. In my video though you can see two orbs of light moving in tandem with a beam of light between them as the moved and flicked for a moment. Then they were gone.;35.4575251773048;-97.5284708037825
