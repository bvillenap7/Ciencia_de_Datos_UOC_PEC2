We were on the north side of Oklahoma City at 7:30 on the night of the 30th of January.  My daughter and me were out in order to watch the transit of the space station.  The Space Station was due to pass by on the north at about 7:30pm that night.  We waited until the space station came by.  As the space station approached from the West and just as the station passed due north we both noticed a bright flash at about the same level as the space station.  Then we noticed another flash at the level below the space station.  This happened just as the space station approached due north of our location.  Just after the second flash, the space station disapeared behind the earths shadow as the Sun was at 20 degrees below the horizon at this time.;35.4575251773048;-97.5284708037825
