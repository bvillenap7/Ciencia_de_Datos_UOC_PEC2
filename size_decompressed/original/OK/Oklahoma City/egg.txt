Floating titanium, metallic, football-shaped UFO seen up close.  ((NUFORC Note:  Witness is former Boeing empl.  PD));1980-06-07 13:00:00;10 minutes;Floating titanium metalic football shaped UFO seen up close over a lunchtime gathering. (This was previously reported years ago and it is shown incorrectly in your database as occurring on 7 January 1980, rather than correctly on 7 June 1980.  Please revise.)   I was part of a group having lunch at a Wendy's restaurant with 8 others.  I was a local college student.  One man had his Ph.D. in history.  Two were recent high school graduates with one of them to enter MIT 2 months later.  The others were high school students who though they watched the UFO, didn't seem at all much interested in what was happening. The restaurant was in a shopping center parking lot on the south side of I-240, facing north, about 150 feet due east of South Pennsylvania Avenue.  I and three others were positioned inside at the table next to the window facing north.  The others in our group were scattered towards the middle of the dining room. The weather was above 90F with a clear blue sky and a stiff southerly wind blowing between 20 and 30 mph.  This location was directly between Will Rogers International Airport 3 miles to the west/southwest and Tinker Air Force Base about 7 miles to the east. The professor at my table looked out the window and said: Look at that!  We looked up and out the window to the north across the frontage road and the highway to see a floating object just on the other side of the highway.  It was hovering about 25 feet above a field and no more than 200 feet due north of us.  The field to the north side of the highway was at least a 20 acre vacant field with houses on the north side of the field, Pennsylvania avenue on the west side, and the I-240 highway on the south side.  The field nowadays has been built up with several businesses.  Many cars sped along the highway, and I didn't notice one car slowing down to look at the object. The object was easy to size relative to the cars speeding by and was a football shaped, titanium colored metallic appearing egg shaped football, about the width of a stretch limousine, while not as tall.  Picture it in the proportion of a football with no visible means of propulsion engines.  It appeared to be morphing on the left and right side in a way that it was slightly narrowing and then lengthening.  The titanium colored skin appeared to be rotating on the horizontal axis and then next on the vertical axis.  All of this again while morphing in width from end to end.  I must say I have no idea exactly what it was as I've never seen anything like it. The object was, as I've stated, floating above the field in a stationary position while we commented on it.  The professor stated that this was the second time he had seen something like this as the previous sighting was many years previous when he lived in Springfield, MO.  He then was driving outside of town with another man and they saw a cigar-shaped object above their car.  No further information on that cigar object is available. Before continuing, the reader must understand that I was a builder and flier of radio control model airplanes and knew extensively all the particulars of aerodynamics.  I later after college worked for Boeing in Industrial Engineering and Manufacturing Research and Development. I first thought could this be a reflection in the glass?  So, I cupped my hands around my face against the glass pane and it looked the same.  I then got up and went outside into the parking lot and it looked the same without any sound, other than the howling south wind.  I knew in no way could it be a balloon of any type with that wind howling as such and the object remaining stationary.   I next walked about 50 feet due west to get a different sight angle relative to the sun.  It looked the same.  I even waved at it to cross over the highway towards me!  It didn't move.   After about 1 more minute, it started slowly moving straight west parallel to the highway about 5 mph.  I went inside.  We watched it continue west about 150 feet until it got to Pennsylvania Avenue, and it curled to the north.  It traveled north on the east side of the street and started inclining at about a 2 degree ascent while gradually gaining speed.  I'd estimate it was eventually moving at nearly 60mph.  It continued straight north until it disappeared out of site over the city. Years later, I worked with many manufacturing techniques and materials at Boeing.  We manufactured titanium parts using a super plastic forming method for the V-22 Osprey and F-22 Fighter, which resulted in much the same appearance as I saw reflected in the outer skin of that UFO.  No skin seams or rivets - just one smooth continuous outer skin surface.  Another manufacturing method that comes to mind is the now popular 3-D printing.;35.4575251773048;-97.5284708037825
Large blue green fire ball, slightly larger than the hiway lights.;1999-11-16 23:30:00;5 seconds;Large blue green fire ball, slightly larger than the hiway lights. Large blue green fire ball, slightly larger than the hiway lights, apx. 90 deg. above horizon, NE of downtown OKC, arched West to East about 30 degrees before decent over horizon. I was traveling South on I-35 at the time, I was just a few miles South West of the State Capitol buildings.  Not a big deal, but it was the first time I had seen a fire ball of this size and type.;35.4575251773048;-97.5284708037825
Quickly descending and then slowly moving, lit, object in NW okc sky.;2014-06-24 21:55:00;30 seconds;quickly descending and then slowly moving, lit, object in NW okc sky. Object descended from empty, unseen space at rapid rate in NW OKC.  Stopped approx. 10,000-20,000 feet above the earth, and slowly moved SW (appeared to be rotating).   Craft had multiple clear light bulbs on the edges of its bottom, as well as some more bulbs at different depths into the craft. the undercarriage was visible but very complex and indescribable.   No sonic boom, surprisingly, due to rate of descent.  Though it is still tonight, there was a brief but large amount of wind 20-30 seconds following objects descent.  This wind lasted for 20 seconds.;35.4575251773048;-97.5284708037825
