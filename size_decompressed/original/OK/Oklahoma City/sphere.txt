Multiple silent red orbs under power over Oklahoma City, approx. 5 min. duration.;2012-10-12 20:30:00;5 minutes;Multiple silent red orbs under power over Oklahoma City, approx. 5 min. duration. Red spheres travelling from SE to NE spaced out in linear pairs from the area of Tinker AFB.  Constant speed. No sound.  Pairs would travel in a straight line, either blink out or disappear into the overcast ---  then a gap of a few seconds and another pair would appear and follow the same pattern.   My son and I stood in a restaurant parking lot and watched for approximately 5 minutes, then they were all gone.    Have never seen anything like it in my life and have seen lots of craft landing and taking off from Tinker AFB.;35.4575251773048;-97.5284708037825
Multiple, spherical orange lights seen over Oklahoma City;2013-06-02 22:30:00;3 minutes;Multiple, spherical orange lights seen over Oklahoma City From the patio of a restaurant on Lake Hefner in Oklahoma City at approximately 22:30 I saw what appeared as 4 orange spherical lights traveling from North to South, spaced much like aircraft approaching an airport for landing, except they all appeared to be at the same altitude.  The speed appeared to be consistent, at first, with an aircraft.  However, there were no red or green wing tip lights and no strobe.  I estimated the altitude to be approximately 4,000 feet. I kept my eyes peeled on the objects hoping to get a more detailed look as they got closer, but before the first object was closer than +/- 2 miles, it began to ascend at approximately a 35° angle to the horizon.  The orange color faded and the size of the object diminished until it took on a star-like appearance and within a few seconds disappeared.  The three objects following took the exact same path. Moments later there were three more orange lights which took the exact same path.  Following that, a few moments later, there were three more.  Two took the same path as the previous 7, but the third disappeared from view due to obstruction of line of site by buildings, and appeared to take a different path. There was no noise associated with these objects and they were never close enough to clearly delineate a shape.;35.4575251773048;-97.5284708037825
2 Amber Orbs Above Lake Overholser Area;2013-11-30 20:20:00;3 minutes;2 Amber Orbs Above Lake Overholser Area 2 bright Orange or Amber colored Spherical crafts aligned horizontally.  They appeared to be about 1/4 mile or less apart from each other.  The 2 crafts made no sound.   After a couple of minutes of watching, one craft disappeared.  The remaining craft was still visible for about 30 seconds until it ascended straight up and out of sight.   This occurred while walking with my son and his friend in NW OKC.

An usual co-incidence with an amazing bright sphere falling or just moving towards the ground.;2014-10-31 19:15:00;3-4 seconds;An usual co-incidence with an amazing bright sphere falling or just moving towards the ground. I had departed my place of work at 7pm  Oct. 31 and Halloween evening.  I had noticed that there was a half moon in the very dark South East sky.  I drove North from SW 74th  on Santa Fe street towards SW 59th  and about half the distance I suddenly saw a very bright very white spherical object seem to move very fast at a descending angle of about sixty degrees towards the East.  It lasted about three to four seconds and then vanished.  I thought it could not be a meteor because it was so bright and white and I have seen many meteors in my time.  It may have been something that crashed but lost its brilliance before doing so.  Just a few hours earlier I was taking to a man about the year 1958 and I had said that that was the year that the Russians had managed to launch a satellite into Earth orbit … it was called 'Sputnik'.  But the next day (Nov. 1St  today) I looked it up on Wikipedia and found out it was launched in 1957 and fell to Earth in 1958.  Anyway! it seems like an odd coincidence that I would even have the discussion about the first satellite, __  and then just hours later see this strange brilliant white object move in the dark sky.

It was actually the larger object of two moving. .. as the large orb passed across the smaller star... it stopped. .. then blinked out... completely vanished.

Red balls of light fly low over residential area.;2015-12-23 22:30:00;3 minutes;Red balls of light fly low over residential area. Eight red ball of light flew together, low, just above the tree line. The lights passed across Council Rd., heading West.  I saw them just before I turned West, into my Addition.  I watched them and kept an eye on them as I passed each block. Looking South down each street I passed they were there.  I accelerated to 45 MPH to get home and retrieve my camera.  They kept up with my speed.  I turned South onto my street, I saw them flying slowly over the trees at the end of the block. I pulled into my driveway and jumped out.  I heard my next door neighbor's front door shut, I ran over and knocked saying, You've got to come out and see this!  He and his friend were witnesses to these lights.  We watched them, their comment was, Those aren't planes, as there was no sound coming from them!  I then ran to my house and got my camera, they had thinned out and were now heading North.  I filmed them. (in viewing my video the red balls looked as if they were tumbling).  After filming I didn't see them anymore.   I got in my car and and drove South, to the other side of the addition.  I saw one in the sky heading West.   I drove onto the main road and did a U-turn, parked on the side of the road.  I got out ready to film, I saw it disappear.  It was gone, like that!   I posted my video to YouTube.  I have the video as evidence.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z27zZcS_Lw ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Dear Mr. Davenport,  I appreciate you getting back with me so quickly.  I've filmed lanterns before and they will emit a swaying, flickering light from inside.  Also, lanterns will rise in altitude.  These red lights kept their same altitude 40 to 50 feet above the ground. They were flying (west) close together for 5 blocks,  (They also kept up with my speed increase).   They started spreading out and heading North, when I came back out with my camera and filmed them, they were continuing North, then completely disappeared lanterns don't do that.  That's when I drove to the other side of my addition to see if there were anymore.  I saw one in the sky and it disappeared as I started to film.   I've had several UFO/UAP  experiences and only reported two sightings, this one with y'all and one with MUFON that happened in 1970, (quite significant).  I've been filming since 2012 and have captured many anomalies with my camera and night vision.  In 2016 I started my own Meetup Group, OKC UFO.  It has been therapeutic for me and other members, as we need an outlet to share our experiences and try to understand the UFO phenomena.  Makes life interesting, defies logic and challenges our reality for sure! Sincerely, ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM));35.4575251773048;-97.5284708037825

Jets were flying by and leaving white contrails behind. Suddenly, as the contrail dissipated, a spherical, black object popped out of it and seemed to fall from a great height toward the earth.  As it did, it seemed to change color from black to a silvery white, before I lost sight of it.;35.4575251773048;-97.5284708037825

Miller Ave. and S.W.61st St. walking north.  The UFO heading West toward Will Rogers World Airport.  I heard a helicopter, so I looked up .  When I did I saw that the helicopter was flying higher than they usually do.  I noticed a flash go past the helicopter. That's when I saw a ball or sphere.  They were going in opposite directions.  Like if to be playing a game of chicken.  As it passed, the sphere looked to be close enough to gauge a measurement.  From what I could guess it looked to be half the size or just a tad smaller than that to the cab of the helicopter.  This is your standard size the police and news use.  I watched as the helicopter would fly in a circle keeping up with but keeping a far distance . Huge circles what might be 2 mile circles. stay high really high up.  The sphere was fling slow and it seemed to spin.  I say that because the sun would reflect off of it in increments.;35.4575251773048;-97.5284708037825

There was no sound.  I first saw it as it was a little north of west, as it passed directly west of me it was about 60 degrees above the horizon.  At around that point I started a I Phone 8 video that lasts 58 seconds and ends when the object passed behind trees.;35.4575251773048;-97.5284708037825
