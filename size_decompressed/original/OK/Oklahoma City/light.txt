Large slow moving cluster of fire balls with orange tails.;2001-12-05 22:24:00;7 min;Large slow moving cluster of fire balls with orange tails. Many reports to local news station but no specific answer. There were speculations of space trash rentering the earths atmosphere, but if that was true why did they move so slow and stay in the sky for a good 7 to 8 minutes?

At first I thought they were birds, but they seemed awfully high. As I watched, the 3 objects formed a perfect triangle and the one below didn't move closer or farther from the 3, but they all moved slowly to the east. Then the 3 formed a more elongated triangle with the 4th staying below them. The three then formed a perfectly straight line. They all seemed to be moving more quickly to the east and becoming dimmer. The 3 top objects again formed a perfect triangle with the 4th one in its same position below as they all faded out of sight. It was a very clear and sunny afternoon with little wind (I didn't pay attention to wind direction at the time). If birds can fly like this, please tell me how and what kind!;35.4575251773048;-97.5284708037825

Then they disappeared less than 5 secconds,   I was surprised, well it reappeared in a different spot in sky more to west but only one big star like light and for only 3-5 secconds dissapeared, I had a simmilar sighting last year in Jully in NM, CO, border on rout 666, lasted for 4 e and reported here, now same kinda lights, I don't thing it was a star, it was a bigger thing and in motion..

Group of 15 to 20 lights flying North to South;2004-09-15 19:00:00;8 - 10 second;Group of 15 to 20 lights flying North to South It was around 9:00 - 9:30 pm. The sky was partly cloudy switching over to a slight overcast that gradually cleared to partly cloudy skies. With all the clouds in the sky the ambient light was very high from the all the city lights.  I was sitting in my backyard facing due North. I had observed other aircrafts previously that night as there is an airforce base( Tinker AFB ) East of where I live.  I had observed these objects (atleast 12 but I'm sure it was between 15 and 20) in a group formation. They were point light based. About the size of the lights you see on aircraft. The color of the light was offwhite like Christmas tree lights. They were solid non-blinking lights first seen grouped together loosely in a oddshaped ball.  I had spotted these lights in the North Eastern direction and they were loosely grouped together moving at a steady speed. About as fast as a small aircraft in flight but fairly far away( had to be in the space between Eastern Ave. and S. Sooner Rd ) flying North to South (perhaps slightly South East)  As these lights flew they slowly separated from their initial grouped positions(all at steady speeds) and spread out horizontaly. Halfway through the sighting I made a note that these lights were fairly low as they were under the cloud layer, and at that time they passed behind trees in the next backyard. After passing behind the trees these lights were even more scattered, flying at the same pace and same brightness (still not blinking or changing colors). The lights headed in this direction untill I lost them infront of the Integris medical building that is a block away from my location.  I can take a picture and mark the direction and appearance when I have time.;35.4575251773048;-97.5284708037825

June 27, 2006 at 10:40 I was in my back yard smoking (facing South). I looked up at the sky and noticed a light to my(right) West. At first I thought it was just a flash of light in my eyes. I blinked a few times. I followed the obeject as it moved from West to east for about 4 seconds. The lights were dim but obvious. I would estimate that it was 4 to 5 miles high(based on the dimness of the lights). The size of the object would be about the size of a pencil if held out at arms length.  There was no blinking of the light and the light ran the entire length of the object.  The object was blurry. My reaction was WTF???? as I watched it disapear into the glow of the City lights in the East.  I live between Tinker AFB and the Oklahoma City airport and am used to seeing all types of aircraft going by, to include blimps and helicopters. This was NOT a normal aircraft.  I am submiting an animated gif of what I saw. I created this using photoshop. The Animation recreates what I saw fairly good except for how high the object seemed to be. The size and speed and brightness are pretty accurate.

I saw a light in the sky then another light eminated from it and fell to the earth when it reached earth the object in sky went out.;2008-12-24 17:45:00;10-15 sec.;I saw a light in the sky then another light eminated from it and fell to the earth when it reached earth the object in sky went out. Hi nuforc staff this is a first for me and i feel silly actually going to the trouble to send this report, but i cant help what i saw on the evening of wednesday december 24 .  First i must say that i have seen what i believed to be a ufo several years ago (5 or more)  that was three very bright lights in the shape of a triangle.  There were muptiple witnessness that saw the object that simply disapeared after a few seconds.  So in saying that, since that incident i have become obsessed in watching for ufos or anything that could not be explained.  I have become an avid skywatcher and have not seen anything out of the ordinary since, until now.  After this incident i searched online for the proper way to report this type of thing and i found this is the way to go. On the evening of Wed. Dec 24 2008, after trying to return a christmas gift i was heading home in the major metro and just before i reached my destination i witnessed a large strange orange light in the NNW sky ahead of me.  I just happened to stare long enough approximately 6-8 seconds to witness another much smaller light that appeared to be the exact same color as the larger light eminate from the larger one and slowly float to the earth in a straight line.  When the smaller light appeared to reach the ground the light in the sky just disappeared. My first impression when i saw the light was an airplane but i remember thinking quickly the plane has dirt inside the light because of the odd color.  Then when the smaller light appeared out of the other i was quickly thinking that sparks were coming out of the plane and i was witnessing a plane malfuntion or crash.  Then when the second object never flickered and went to the earth at the same slow speed and as soon as it seemed to reach earth the object in the sky simply went out, i knew i was seeing something unordinary.  So i pulled off the side of the road and stopped to look for a plane or helicopter.  I stared at that part of the sky for anything flying and seen absolutely nothing.  The background was nothing but sky with a few high level clouds.  I hope to talk to any representative who wishes to hear this account in person.  THIS IS NOT A HOAX.  follow ups will be granted and wishfully expected.;35.4575251773048;-97.5284708037825

I build custom cars and motorcycles for a living and work in a private shop on the outer northwest edge of Oklahoma city.  During these hot months I will work late at night and early mornings to beat the heat. On Saturday, july 21, 2012, at approximatly 10:00 pm I was headed to work.  At about three miles out from the shop I noticed this mass of lights ahead to the west and northwest.  I was coming from the east and noticed more and more of the lights as i progressed toward the west.  I was on W. Memorial ave between N. Rockwell ave. and N. Council Rd. As I approached Council road that is when i saw the most lights at one time. They were a glowing red/orange that did not flash but seemed to appear and disappear according to the angle you were veiwing them.  By then I had my phone out and was attempting to record these lights while trying to get safley off the road.  The large group of lights were in some type of triangular formation headed straight west, there were approximatly 15 to 20 lights in this formation and the angle of view would be 25 to 30 degrees.  As the large group went out of sight there were smaller groups, say 4 or 5 lights and i saw three of these smaller groups.  These are the ones I captured in the first video and were coming from the north headed south then turned to the west and followed the large group that was out of sight by then. I then proceeded to the shop, off of Memorial rd. and County line rd. where i shot the second video.  In this video i had turned out the outside lights around the shop hoping to have less light interferance. while filming this  video i was facing dihttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFJD6AUgp18rectly to the south . The lights that i captured here were headed straight west. My angle of sight was again 25 to 30 degrees. The weather conditions that night were clear skys. according to the National Weather Service out of Norman Oklahoma. At 10:00 pm the wind was @ 5 mph out of the east and the loft, which was checked at 6:00 pm was out of the northeast @ 15 mph at 3000 ft. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GVI1yTHUHU     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFJD6AUgp18 Here are the two videos i captured and posted on youtube.

Orange lights over Oklahoma City.;2014-08-29 20:54:00;6 minutes;Orange lights over Oklahoma City. I had gone outside to look for a satellite which was supposed to be fairly bright.  As I was looking for it I saw a very bright, very orange light moving much faster than a satellite but much slower than a meteor.  It arced across the sky on a S-N trajectory and finally disappeared rapidly well above the northern horizon.  Then I looked up and saw another one on a what  I would say was a parallel trajectory.  Both were significantly brighter than the brightest view of the ISS I have seen and moving much faster.  There was absolutely no noise. I watched the second one disappear in the same manner.  I went back in the house to tell my wife and was was totally astonished at what I had seen.   After 2-3 minutes I went back outside and there was another one moving overhead.  I called my wife to come look and by the time she got to the door it was past the roofline from where she was when she said, I see it!  There was another one moving in the same path.   I saw a total of 4 and she saw 1.  There was no trail left by any of the 4.  The bright orange color stayed constant on all 4--no flickering or pieces separating--until they finally disappeared quite rapidly above the norther horizon.  The final two disappeared well above the horizon. I spotted the first one at 8:54 PM central time, the second at ~8:56, the third at ~8:59 and the fourth at ~9:00. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Yes, the correct time is 8:54 pm central time.  Sorry for the error.  I will be curious to see how many other reports there were of these same objects.

Lights floating in the air.;2015-05-15 21:00:00;Few minutes;lights floating in the air This is an old one, but I want to tell it.  I worked afternoons in Oklahoma City and was commuting  back home down the freeway one night.  There was a lot of traffic going both ways. I was heading east on I40 near Choctaw OK and noticed a couple of lights off to the left, north of the freeway, up in the sky.  At first, I thought it was an airplane as Tinker AFB was about 5 miles away, I just went past it minutes earlier.  Here I was, driving down one hill and heading back up another, when I noticed a pair of lights that were stationary up in the sky, north of the freeway.  Just floating maybe a hundred feet up or two hundred. I thought it was weird, because I thought it was incoming aircraft like right next to each other in the sky.  Maybe 50 feet or a hundred feet apart.  Way too far apart to be a helicopter.  They did not move at all, and I thought maybe it was a work crew on a cell tower, with lights, but drove back to work the next day in the daylight and there ! was no tower there, or anything else.  Then a couple of nights later I saw the same thing, same area but south of the freeway.  My buddy was retired Air Force,  I asked him did the Air Force have anything like it and he just shook his head no. I opened my window, and tried to see it, but traffic was moving fast so I just drove on.  All I could hear was the traffic and the wind.

I saw a stationary star-like object in the SSE sky that completely turned on and off at regular intervals like an airplane light.  While it was visible, it twinkled like a star would do before fading to a yellowish hue and disappearing while still flashing. It was of similar color to Sirius but not quite as bright and was about 25 or 30 degrees above the horizon.  It looked exactly like what a star would look like if somebody were turning it on and off like a light bulb once per second. Airplane lights aren't this bright and don't twinkle like a star.

Light appears over South OKC and seemingly defies physics by disappearing between light pulses and reappearing miles away.;2017-07-04 21:00:00;5 minutes;Light appears over South OKC and seemingly defies physics by disappearing between light pulses and reappearing miles away. Sitting on first floor apartment porch behind my mother and with two of my mother's work friends around 21:00, the sky was mostly dark with a small hint of sunlight left.  I noticed a bright red light out of the corner of my right eye hovering over another apartment building.  Not right over the complex, but a couple of miles East of our location.   I turned my head to look in that direction, as I turned my head the red light went away and became a small white blinking light.  It hovered in the same spot for a bit before moving. When moving, the light pulsed out and it reappeared in another spot.  Each time it moved, it moved West towards our apartment complex.   There was a pillar blocking my mother's view, so she didn't notice it until it was almost directly over the complex.  I hadn't said anything to her at this point thinkng it would disappear and I wouldn't be believed.  As it stopped and hovered over the complex, my mother and I stared at it without words, she was still unaware I had been watching it way before she noticed it.   Then it started to pulse green and as it did, its light grew bigger and brighter, along with some sporadic movements around the area in which it had been hovering.  Finally it moved in the same manner, seemingly jumping from spot to spot between light pulses towards the North and out of view.  Multiple times before its seemingly laws-of-physics-defying movements to the North. my mother vocalized her thought that it must be a helicopter before its light turned green.  Needless to say, her helicopter theory was shot down as our jaws dropped in awe when it seemingly disappeared and reappeared miles away.  Certainly no human could endure that type of acceleration and G forces without being fatally injured.   No actual object was viewed, just the light.   This was both mine and my mother's first UFO experience.;35.4575251773048;-97.5284708037825

After going into the backyard to watch the fireworks, we saw two light hovering above the firework display.  Another appeared below it and to the right.   We recorded 15 minutes of it with a cell phone.  It was flashing non-stop between red, green, and white.  We thought it was a helicopter, since it did not move at all for almost the whole time, but we could not hear the rotor.  It was pretty loud during the firework display, but in between the fireworks we should have been able to hear if it was a helicopter.   Another flashing object appeared under it and to the right.  That object was flashing at about half the speed of the first one.   A third object flew across the sky, but the camera phone was unable to pick it up.  We both saw the third one fly through the smoke of the fireworks.   I have it recorded, and would happily email it to your team.

Bright white lights flying in military formation.  ((Starlink satellites??));2020-10-16 20:34:00;10 minutes;Bright white lights flying in military formation I witnessed 31 aircraft flying in a military or migratory bird formation over Oklahoma City between Council Rd. and County Line Rd.

They were flying faster than what a plane would be at that height, but not anything crazy fast. They didn’t make a sound, which is weird considering that there were 31 of them. I can’t get any information out of local airports and my camera could not pick up any of the lights. I’ve tried editing it for color and background, but haven’t been successful. I don’t know if it’s my editing skills, or if these craft can only be seen in thermal radar, but i know what I saw and I’d like to know if anyone can help me in this matter. Thank you.;35.4575251773048;-97.5284708037825
