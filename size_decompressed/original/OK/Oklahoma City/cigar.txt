Shining silver cigar, suspended in the sky, reflecting the sun, then turning dark, then disappearing...;2000-07-14 17:40:00;@ 1 minute;Shining silver cigar, suspended in the sky, reflecting the sun, then turning dark, then disappearing... Since my only UFO sighting prior to Friday, other than a big green fire ball back in this past Winter, was over 15 years ago, in Colorado, and since I have been recently watching the skies more often... for those crazy 'chem-trails', and since I grew up next to a Naval Air station, and since I used to fly a Piper Cherokee, years ago, and since I DO know what most airplanes look like in the sky.... imagine for a moment, what would be going through your mind, if you saw a silver cigar (or hot dog) looking thing in the sky... about 70 degrees above the horizon, on a CLEAR DAY, with NO CLOUDS, and a BRIGHT 102 degree sun-shiny day, and this thing is NOT moving to the right or left, it has no tail... it is round on both ends... from my perspective it was about as long as the shorter top bar of a utility pole, (or width of the thumb with arm extended) (no way to gauge distance or actual size) and it is shining, reflecting the sun.  My first thought, it was an aircraft, and the sun was reflecting off the wings, but it would have to be in a steep climb... since the object was perfectly horizontal... but it is not gaining or losing altitude.  If it were the fuselage that was reflecting the sun, I should be able to see the tail, and if it were the wings, the body of the aircraft should be visible.  It is not getting larger or smaller, as an aircraft would, if it were headed toward you, or away.  It is shining, it is stationary, it appears to be 'floating' or suspended, it is silver and reflecting the sun, for a few seconds, then it turns 'dark' as if shadowed, but it is the same size, in the same location.  Then after a few seconds it 'vanishes' from the same location, never changing it's size or position?  NOT what I would call ... normal operating procedure for standard aircraft?  Hummmmm... something else to ponder?  Maybe it was just a trick of light on a plain ol' plane?  But it was still VERY odd to plain ol' me!;35.4575251773048;-97.5284708037825
Object seen pacing small aircraft over Oklahoma City,OK;2001-07-18 22:30:00;30 seconds;Object seen pacing small aircraft over Oklahoma City,OK At 22:30 on 07/18/01 in the 4100 block of S Agnew in Oklahoma City, OK, myself and one other person saw and heard a small jet, possibly a Lear Jet or Gulf Stream.  The jet seemed to be on an aproach to Will Rogers Airport.  It was heading due south directly over our location.  The jet was flying low, perhaps 2000 to 2500 feet above the ground.  I was the first to notice an other object just off the plane's left side.  The object was about 75 to 100 feet from the left side and keeping pace with the plane.  At first I thought I was seeing a reflection in my glasses. I asked the other person with me if they saw it too.  They did. We watched for about 45 seconds, untill the jet and object disappeared behind some trees to our south.  The object had no lights of it's own and was only lighted by the street lights below.  The object looked to be cigar shaped, 25 feet long and 10 feet wide.  The object was gray in color and made no sound that we could hear over that of the jet.  The object made to change in direction other  than to pace the plane.  The weather was clear with a few stars showing, wind was from the south at 5 MPH.  Temp was in the 90's  Myself nor the other person had been drinking or taking any drugs.;35.4575251773048;-97.5284708037825
Two UFOs spotted in Oklahoma City;2006-08-04 19:12:00;30 seconds;Two UFOs spotted in Oklahoma City I saw two objects traveling in what appeared to be formation. They were whitish in appearance, not shiny or bright white. There was no sound and no contrails. They were moving slowly from SSE to NNW. After viewing them for about 20 seconds I ran to get my husband (who is an aeronautical engineer) to see them, by the time we returned only one was visible and it was soon obscured by trees, I believe the other one was already obscured by the time I got my husband out there, he was not able to locate the last one before it disappeared into the trees. There were large cloud formations all around and the ground temp indicated by my thermometer was about 97 degrees. There was no wind. Obviously I have no idea of the altitude of these craft. I would also like to say that I worked for the Air Force for 27 years and I know an airplane when I see one, these were not airplanes!;35.4575251773048;-97.5284708037825
Fast moving white and green that disappears.;2020-11-06 21:25:00;0.001;Fast moving white and green that disappears. I was walking dog.  We were walking the middle of the street going east.  I looked up and saw a fast moving object in the sky.  It looked like a cigar.  I had a clear light in front and light that blinked green.  I was moving faster than a shooting star.  It was moving faster than any plane I have every seen.  There Was no sound.  It then disappeared.;35.4575251773048;-97.5284708037825
