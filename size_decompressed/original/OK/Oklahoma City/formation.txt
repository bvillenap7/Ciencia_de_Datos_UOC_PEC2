5 lights with orange trails;2001-12-01 23:15:00;1-2 minutes;5 lights with orange trails In the west sky were 5 lights flying north.  All lights had orange streaks eminating from the rear except for the leading light.  One streak seemed to be at an angle towards the ground for a time.  Each light was traveling at the same speed relative to one another.  This made it appear as if it could have been one object with lights on the corners.  It appeared as if the color between the lights was darker than the background of the sky.  There was no aircraft sound.  One of the fainter lights were blue.  After the formation flew a few miles north, it began to turn east and out of sight.  A police officer was in the parking lot behind us.  He told us it was fighter planes with their after-burners on. I suppose this could be true but I work outside at night and I've never seen anything like it before.

Group of orange glowing lights, flying and darting around in the sky, yet staying together in a group;2008-01-17 00:00:00;3 minutes;Group of orange glowing lights, flying and darting around in the sky, yet staying together in a group Seen around 5:15 pm Oklahoma City, OK.  Just got off work, was walking torwards my car and happened to look up at the sky.  What I saw was 15-20 tiny pin dots in the sky flying around together in a group or cluster.  They seemed to be alluminated by something and were a glowing orange/red color.  They were very high in the sky.  Flying around similar to the way a group of birds would.  But there is no way they were birds because they were too high in the sky to be able to be seen.  I know these objects were extremely high in the sky because an airplane flew over head about 60 seconds after they were gone and it was about the same distance up, (maybe a little lower) and was much larger.  Whatever I saw must have been large in size to be able to be seen at this altitude.  After realizing that I might be a witnessing an UFO, I decided to watch one of the objects flying around.  So I focused on one of them....it did a few zig zags and loops and then completely vanished.  So, I decided to get someone to witness what I was seeing.  I went back into the building and found a colleage of mine, and brought them out to see what I had seen.  When I looked up, there was nothing in the sky.  Absolutely nothing, whatever I had seen was gone.  It did not take me more that 15-20 seconds to find my work colleage.
