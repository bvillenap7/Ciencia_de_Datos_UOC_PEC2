Inverted craft 40+ft long over North Oklahoma City  hovering  moving and changing directions;2010-07-25 20:30:00;15 Min;Inverted craft 40+ft long over North Oklahoma City  hovering  moving and changing directions Last Sunday evening 7/25/10 my wife and I were sitting out on our patio and notice in the west as the sun was sitting  we saw what looked like a inverted air craft hovering and  rotating also moving slowly to the south.   I went and got my binoculars and when we looked through them I was amazed to see it had strange shape wings and a upper fuselage with what look like 4 engines on the tail.  All this was in the inverted position like it wanted to land some where.  I call for my son to view this and he also wittiness this.   I watched this for 10 to 15 minutes, then craft went up at least 2000ft and then started moving to the north west as it picked up speed.  The craft seem to be in the 40 to 50 ft range tall. I could tell because it was fairly close to the TV towers, each painted section is 100 ft so I could gauge this a bit.   After this was over I'm sure others saw this since we live in North Oklahoma City.  Also there was no enging noise, the craft was a matt black as best i could tell.  My wife was scared and my son was a little shaken over the event.;35.4575251773048;-97.5284708037825
