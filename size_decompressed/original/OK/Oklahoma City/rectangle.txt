Looked like a helicopter from a distance but the closer we drove to it the more it semed like something else. As we drove under the object on the highway continuing to follow speed limit.  We notice no sound was coming from the object and it was stationary transparent alomst but reflected light from the street lights on the bottom.  rectangel in shape two red ligts on one end with a space in between and two green lights on the other end. it was trying to pose as a steet light or helicopter light skeem.  We went to drive around back to it for further detail but when we got back to the spot the craft had already vanished. We think it was observing the cars on the road.
