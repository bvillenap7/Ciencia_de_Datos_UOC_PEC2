Unusual spacecraft 15 ft obove me.  Stationary, solid matter.  Did not hover.;1980-05-15 20:00:00;5 minutes;Unusual spacecraft 15 ft obove me.  Stationary, solid matter.  Did not hover. May or June 1980 (Five Witnesses) Oklahoma City, Oklahoma  Location: N. Portland Avenue, Oklahoma City between 8:00 and 8:30 P.M.  We observed two bright objects, parallel to each other some distance away.  The objects were extremely bright and circular in shape.  At first, it didn't seem to be that unusual, because they were aligned with a transmitting signal tower (radio, television or cable station), the objects blended symmetrically with the tower, that is, until one of the objects shirfted its position.  The circular objects were still positioned on either side of the tower, except one of the objects was higher than the other.  Before the sudden movement, I had been ready to head back inside the building, but this definitely caught my attention.  Suddenly, the object on the left side of the signal tower moved diagonally up and out of sight, and the object on the right side re-appeared directly over our heads.  The movements were made simultaneously.  The craft over my head was approximatedly 15, possibly 20 feet directly above where I was standing.  If I had had a fire engine ladder I could have touched this thing.  For some reason, I was not scared, I just stood there looking up, saying - That's a 'blanking' UFO. I must have said it five or six times, with no real excitement in my voice.  I stayed very calmed.  The craft remained there for about twenty, or thirty seconds.  I remember turning my head slowly, from left to right while looking straight up (head tilted completely back) to see the full scope of this craft.  When I regained my senses, I realized I was standing out there alone.  The other four witnesses had scattered, obviously frightened.  I don't remember how or when, but I must have gone back into the building to retrieve my purse and keys, because all I can remember next, is driving home.  While driving, I could see military jes flying in formation, two or three at a time, darting across the sky in all directions.  There was a lot of activity in the skies that night.  I had had the car radio on and the DJ was talking about sightings in Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas and several other states.  It could have been Arizona instead of Kansas, I just can't remember.  This only reinforced my sense of reality.  Anyway, the next day the radio person announced that the military, or some official agency had issued a statement saying the sightings were merely weather balloons.  When I was asked a few days later to describe what I saw, all I could say was it appeared to change shape depending on its angle of observation.  It wasn't circular as it originally appeared in the sky, or triangular.  It was more...uniquely shaped.  What I assumed to be the front was hexangular in shape, and the angles appeared longer toward the rear, and more so on its right side, forming a rectangle toward the back right.  This object had some unique dimenional geometry.  I remember thinking later that it had extraordinary aerodynamics.  I only saw the bottom and not the top or sides.  Although, I do recall a picture of the craft on the Phil Donahue show that would have aired sometime in '88 or'89.  Someone, I think in Texas had taken the picture of the craft at a higher altitude.  I only caught a few moments of the show on my way out the door.  This object did not hover. Hover to me, means slight movement while trying to maintain the exact location and altitude.  This object was stationary, solid matter, a solid mass suspended by some unknowned energy.  It defied gravity.  I do not recall any radiating heat, or hearing any sound.  And, because I could visually see the entire craft, I would guessimate the craft to be 1200 to 1500 sq. ft. in circumference with some type of grid outline on the bottom.  I think I saw lights within the grid, but I'm not certain.  It didn't appear to be shiny or brightly lit, while suspended above my head.  I seem to recall it was grayish-silver color.  What I cannot explain is the speed of this craft.  It's like it manipulated, folded or enveloped the air space in dimensions I haven't... Yeah! I can't explain it.  Its departure was fractionally subliminal and left no residual effects.  It was beyond my level of intelligence, nothing I could wrap my mind around.  This sighting as it unfolded would have had Einstein either scratching his head or beaming with delight.  Either way, I'm no Einstein or Newton.  It definitely wasn't a figment of my imagination.  I am not saying I saw an alien spacecraft from some other galaxy.  I'm simply describing an Unidentified Flying Object.  However, if we do have his type of technology here on this planet, then someone or some organization has developed a way to manipulate gravity and the speed of light.  Moreover, there must be a higher degree of mathematics, way beyond calculus and trigonometry that a secret select group of scientists haven't shared with the little minds of planet earth, because this definitely defies general physics and gravity, as we know it.  It is a form of energy that is mind-boggling.  To this day I believe I had a visual close encounter of some kind.  I have never wavered in what I saw that day.  Trying to explain the encounter is extrememly difficut, or next to impossible due to lack of knowledge and things beyond my comprehension.  I cannot remember who said this, but they captured my frustration in a nutshell:  For those who understand, no explanation is necessary.  For those who do not understand, no explanation is possible.: ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of event is approximate.  PD));35.4575251773048;-97.5284708037825

Dark shiny cylinder;2004-05-28 14:00:00;30 sec;Dark shiny cylinder I was at work on the afternoon of May 28th 2004 when I noticed out the window that a worker across the street was outside looking north into the sky.   I looked and observed (I know this sounds crazy) a blurry object the shape of a yoyo.  The outer parts were dark with the inner part being lighter.  This object was motionless.  It then came into focus as it rotated and became a long shiny dark cylindrical shape.   I ran outside to get a better look.  It took me less than 5 seconds to get outside, but by that time it had vanished.  The worker across the street said it had come rapidly from the east to the point were it became motionless.  It was not a balloon, a helicopter or a plane.   To this day I still cannot quit thinking about what it might have been.;35.4575251773048;-97.5284708037825
Two OKLAHOMA UFO sightings;2007-04-22 20:30:00;Unknown;Two OKLAHOMA UFO sightings It was late in the evening (out in my backyard), the sun had almost finished setting. There were two objects in the sky apart from each other.  One was moving slightly, for the remainder of the report this one shall be called:A.  The other one shall be called: B.  A was moving slightly, in a circle. B stayed still but it changed shape.  B was like a half-moon at first, but later it looked like two objects and it started moving slightly.  Both objects remained in this manner.  Both were bright. The other 3 witnesses (besides myself) were in a backyard, around the same area.

UFO over Oklahoma.;2014-10-07 12:00:00;~4 minutes;UFO over Oklahoma Just after 12:30 on lunch hour I had gone outside to the designated area to smoke.  I turn to the north eastern part of the sky and see this cylinder shaped object moving at a slow speed from north to south.  It's about the size of a quarter at arms length and pure white in color.  When it got just past halfway middle of the sky it appeared to change shape, like the front half had slowed down and the back end had to catch up and it had a more cigar shape.  Its direction changed to a slow arc toward the sun.  Then in an instant it starts to shape shift probably because the sun was reflecting off of different surfaces, it gave the appearance of rapid movement back and forth and from side to side violently, it would appear in one spot then disappear and instantaneously appear in another spot near to where it previously was then again and again and again maybe 7 or 8 times  looked like it had a different shape each time while continuing in the same direction.  T! hen it shifted 3 or 4 times more only less rapid and growing brighter as it approaches the sun.  It stops at a distance of about a dime held at arms length from the sun and by this time is as bright as the sun like a mirror held up to it, only much smaller.  It stays in that place for about five to six seconds then it appears to back away a little and all of a sudden it's not glowing any more, it is still close to the sun and should be still glowing but it's not, it has stopped reflecting any sunlight at all and  become a darker greyish color thin horizontal bar shape, much less visible than when I first saw it but can still be seen.  It held that position briefly, then it punches out, to a dot in the sky then gone.  I was oblivious to time but I think 4 minutes or so.

Orange/Reddish flying object seen in the Oklahoma City area.;2014-10-14 19:15:00;3 minutes;Orange/Reddish flying object seen in the Oklahoma City area. It was unbelievable.  Orange redish object in the sky.  Started oval shaped.  After watching for many seconds, it began to change shape.  Growing longer, but thinner.  After two to three minutes of being very visual, quickly faded away and disappeared into the sky.  About a mile down, I saw a second object in the sky, not the same one.  I saw them both In the sky at the same time.  It happened almost exactly the same as the first.  My best friend was in the car with me and witnessed the exact same thing I'm describing.;35.4575251773048;-97.5284708037825
Shiny small fast moving object in Oklahoma City;2014-12-16 09:00:00;01:00;shiny small fast moving object in Oklahoma City my husband and I left Walmart from grocery shopping and was heading east on Hefner Road. I saw a very bright but small shiny object high up in the atmosphere/sky. it was moving very fast and I asked my husband what is that.  he said it has to be a jet or a meteor but we kept watching it and it was moving very fast and stop all of a sudden.  we pulled to the side of the road to continue watching it as it stood still in the sky and then it started disappearing slowly.  we both were speechless and laughed about we had just seen a UFO we had never seen anything like it before.  I wish I would have recorded it it was amazing;35.4575251773048;-97.5284708037825

Flying object seen over Oklahoma City.;2019-01-23 16:00:00;30 minutes;Flying object seen over Oklahoma City. Driving home from Edmond, saw a weird shaped cloud.  It was like when a jet takes off leaves the cloud going from small to large.  But this was backwards, the cloud looked like it came from above the clouds and coming in.   My wife saw this white diamond light shape in the sky next to it hovering/sitting still.  As we are driving home, it disappeared and reappeared.  Then she said it's moving up it's going up, she started taking a video of it.  It appeared as if it was moving up at a high rate of speed, then it slowed down.  She recorded for awhile, then it vanished.   I pulled into a gas station to see clearly but it was gone.  At one point it changed colors, it was bright white like a lamp, but then turned black and back to white again.;35.4575251773048;-97.5284708037825
