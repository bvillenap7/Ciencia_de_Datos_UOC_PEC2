A falling type streak that went down, up, down and back up leaving a trail with a flash before it disappeared.;1999-07-25 05:00:00;7seconds;A falling type streak that went down, up, down and back up leaving a trail with a flash before it disappeared. At approximately 0500hrs on the 25th of July, 1999, I was working on Tinker Air Force base at one of the perimeter gates facing the east.  I observed what at first appeared to be a falling star.  However, it was about twice as large as a star appeared to be at that time.  The object had a light green tint to it against the dark blue sky.  It fell as a falling star or meteor would, then suddenly went back up, then fell again, then went back up leaving a brighter trail then flashed as it disappeared. The object was only visible for approxemately 7 to 10 seconds.;35.4575251773048;-97.5284708037825
Strange Strobing Lights;2002-11-05 06:43:00;40 seconds;Strange Strobing Lights I was driving to work in NW Oklahoma City,  South I-74.  I looked out to the East, in direction of Jones, Oklahoma.  I saw strange strobing white lights.  About five of them in the shape of a upside down - horizontal checkmark.   I cannot tell the distance, but my guess is 10 to 15 miles away.  If I held my thumb up at arms distance, the UFO would be about 2 inches long.  There is a major miliary base in that area.   My guess is they could have been military aircraft, but I have worked as an engineer for the Air Force all my life and have never seen this effect in the sky.;35.4575251773048;-97.5284708037825
Possible booster streams in a state with launch sites I've been able to find.;2009-11-03 18:50:00;About seven minutes;Possible booster streams in a state with launch sites I've been able to find. First off, I'm not assuming this is extra-terrestrial.  I think it might have been some kind of rocket, and am primarily looking for ways to check and see if any known launchings were taking place on November 6, 2009, at about 6:50 pm CST near Oklahoma City.  I don't know how to look for that kind of information, since searches online aren't bearing much fruit.  I was driving home with my boyfriend, and for about seven minutes, we drove towards a little pink dot near the sunset.  From far away, I asked my boyfriend what he thought it was, and he guessed maybe Venus.  However, as we got closer, the object got significantly larger.  We only traveled about two miles, so I don&#8217t think this thing would have been particularly high in the sky.  When we saw it at its closest, it appeared to be two white streams being emitted from a single tiny black dot situated above the streams.  That dot flickered orange frequently.  I&#8217d pass it off as a jet using its booster from Tinker Air Force Base, but this object did not appear to move.  My boyfriend said it looked like it might be moving slowly upwards, which would make sense if the streams were coming from thrusters.  Unfortunately, I had to turn the car at that point, and we couldn&#8217t see it anymore.  It had gone from near the horizon to almost directly overhead as it got larger, and once we turned, it was obscured by the car roof.  I rushed home, which probably took about five minutes, grabbed my camera, and ran back out...  But we couldn&#8217t find it again.  I saw an airplane flying on the horizon near it, when it was still too small to distinguish the streams.  The plane was much smaller than the shape, even then, and looked farther away.  I could also see the plane moving, while I could not observe the object moving.  It seemed terrestrial to me, maybe a rocket taking up a satellite or something.  I just don&#8217t know where would be close enough to launch something like that, for it to be close enough to visually change so significantly in size after driving only a couple of miles.  If there is anywhere I can check records of what&#8217s been launched when and where, I&#8217d really like to check out whatever it was that I saw.  Location information:  When we lost whatever it was, we were facing West and turning South on N 122nd and Memorial in Oklahoma City.  Image information:  I couldn't get a picture, but I did a couple of quick illustrations.  The first shows the shape from far away, when we first saw it, and the airplane behind it.  The second shows how it looked when we saw it at its closest.  I don't see where to attach them to this, but I will email them to the address provided.;35.4575251773048;-97.5284708037825
Craft with lights but no sound;2009-12-12 04:00:00;60 sec;a craft with lights but no sound I was setting on my deck having a smoke, something caught my eye to the southwest just comming past the back of the house. Couldn't see the overall shape, too dark. Just the back lights. 2 triangle shapes at either end with numerous white lights around the triangle, showing their shape and 2 lights inbetween the triangles flashing a red light between the two. But what really made me wonder about it was, it was flying just along the treetops, very low to the ground, moving slow and it made no sound.;35.4575251773048;-97.5284708037825

White, flat UFO in South Oklahoma City.;2015-05-21 08:30:00;5 seconds;White, flat UFO in South Oklahoma City I was driving east on the Southside of Oklahoma City, when I saw what I thought was a white bird.  I then realized that it didn't have any wings to flap, and it was very still.  It was briefly going south when I saw it, and it, and then disappeared into thin air.  It had nothing to hide behind, but it was there one second and gone the next.  It was white in appearance, and not very large, but was maybe 150 feet away from me?  There was no doubt in my mind that it was a UFO.  There were some clouds behind the object, and that's how I knew it had disappeared into thin air.  Like I said, it was white and sort of flat and long.;35.4575251773048;-97.5284708037825
UFO hovering over steeple gold statue at Church of LDS, located in Oklahoma City, Surrey Hills Addition.;2015-11-21 23:00:00;1 min 41 seconds;UFO hovering over steeple gold statue at Church of LDS, located in Oklahoma City, Surrey Hills Addition. Reporting Party Background: -FAA Licensed Private Pilot (helicopter rated). -Former Police Officer. -Employed 36 years in a line of work which requires keen observation, analysis and reporting.  As a Pilot, I know a little about flight operations and characteristics, especially associated with those craft which fly low and slow like the helicopter I fly.  Summary of Video: The video is poor resolution, periodically showing the flashing rear red lights (a large triangle pattern) located at the tail of the craft.  Video time stamp for the lights:  at 3 to 30 seconds, flashing approximately every second (located middle right of screen), then at 29 to 34 seconds (middle left of screen), and at 1:15 to 1:19 (middle).  Incident Details: At around 11:00pm November 21st, 2015, I was driving North on Hastings when at the intersection of Coachman Rd and Hastings I noticed what appeared to be a large fixed wing passenger plane coming in for final approach to Sundance Airpark runway 36, which is located within one mile to the NE.  I didn’t pay much attention to it.  I noticed a white male jogger with black hair at that same intersection who looked back at the craft as well, so I know there was at least one other witness.  I continued North on Hastings and stopped at Surrey Hills Blvd where the craft (single hand hex dumb bell - much thicker in the middle - see my sketch) had quickly descended from an altitude of around 500-800ft AGL to a full stop hover around 75ft AGL and directly over the Church of the LDS gold horn blower Christus Statue, brightly illuminated by upward pointing spot lights. The craft began flashing several large lights (located flush in the belly and seemingly at least 10ft in diameter each) i! n varied patterns of colors normally associated with the old color projection television sets (red, green, blue, etc).  This really captured my full attention.  I was so mesmerized that I failed to start my phone camera……..either that or something else kept me from engaging my camera.  The craft appeared to be at least the length of the LDS building (190ft appx) and about 4-5 stories in height.  My outstretched hand holding a cantaloupe would have covered the craft, viewed from 500ft away.  The craft made no engine noise whatsoever, except for sporadic compressed air sounds (perhaps bow thrusters – not the same sound that hot air balloon igniters make).  When I finally engaged my camera video and looked back toward the craft, it had just departed from hover and traveled directly over Surrey Hills Blvd in a Westerly direction.  I followed at 30mph until I ran out of road.  I estimate the craft was at an altitude of appx 100ft AGL and traveling no more than 35mph, all the whi! le making no noise.  It was completed blacked out except for a! large t riangular pattern of 3 red lights located at the tail,  slowly flashing appx once per second (was not an LED flash more of a glow from dim to bright).  Note that lighter than air craft (like hot air balloons) have no propulsion or motors that I know of, as they travel at the mercy of the wind direction.   I first thought this had to be a drone or lighter than aircraft, however, how could that be true when it was the size of a large building?  Besides, FAA requires Drone Pilots to obtain special authorization in order to operate at night, and the drone cannot weigh more than 55 pounds.  I do not believe a “Lighter than Air” craft can operate at night without being tethered to the ground, and I do not believe they are equipped with flashing likes those required on standard manned aircraft.;35.4575251773048;-97.5284708037825
Small, square, shiny objects circling like paper falling.;2017-03-27 17:00:00;1 minute;small squre shiny objects circling like paper falling The sky was blue except for 4 contrails from aircraft.  No storms were called for that day and winds were probably 7mph at the time.  I was walking at the park on the trail and saw a Drone flying above the park.  I stopped to look at it but it turned.  I continued to walk.  Then the drone came back into my view.  When I looked up to see the drone, something flashing in the sky to the left of the drone caught my attention.   At first, I thought it was birds, but realized that they objects were too high up to be birds.  The objects began to descend.  It was then I realized that there were at least 6 or more objects.  They were square and for a second I thought they were ticker tape pieces of paper flying in the blue area of the sky.  But then they began to circle each other and move in away that made me realize it was not paper.   The color of the squares were a translucent white and reminded me of mother of pearl.  The objects circles and flittered around for a minute but then! went up into a contrail.  They kind of disappeared at that point then someone asked me what I was looking at and when I looked back up they were gone or had blended into the contrail.  I could not see them anymore.;35.4575251773048;-97.5284708037825
Object sitting in the sky not moving;2018-06-18 20:45:00;15 minutes;Object sitting in the sky not moving I had walked outside to check my mail and when I was walking back I looked up to West and observed an object in the sky.   It was far away and very high up with bright white lights on the bottom and what looked to be a red light on top.  It was not moving and sat in the same place in the sky for several minutes.   I went back inside and got my phone and came back out to take a picture of it.  I took several pictures using my IPhone 7 and watched it for about 5 more minutes.  It still did not move, did not get further away or closer.;35.4575251773048;-97.5284708037825
Object headed N and quickly made a correction into the S direction unlike any plane I have ever witnessed.  ((anonymous report));2018-11-19 16:45:00;1.5 minutes;I observed one aircraft which looked like an ordinary airplane as far as I could tell.  I heard a loud roaring and when I finally caught sight of the aircraft it was headed north and quickly made a correction into the southern direction unlike any plane I have ever witnessed.    Seconds after that I lost sight of it, but could still hear the very loud engine sound.  Seconds later I witnessed a contrail a ways from my last sighting and it appeared in a dash like pattern and the engine sound continued for a few more seconds and then suddenly stopped.  Again, this may sound mundane, but it corrected itself in the opposite direction so quickly, I've never witnessed this and I have attended many airshows over my lifetime.  I watch planes a lot in the sky because I have always had a fascination with them. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Multiple ongoing encounters with triangular objects that have un-fathomable speed.;2019-08-10 23:00:00;Continues;Multiple ongoing encounters with triangular objects that have un-fathomable speed. Hi I have witnessed craft every night now for 3 months I know that may sound crazy but it very true I am a very sane person to tell the truth I never believed in this stuff. 3 months ago I began noticing starange lights in sky . I started climbing on the roof at night one night I woke up on the roof after falling asleep and all around me was a smoke or cloud like substance that had a weird smell and I looked and not 10 feet from my face to my left was a very very large craft it looked as if it was made from black glass very sleek . I was very shocked that it made no sound. It slowly backed up about 50 yards and very fastly was gone at first I thought it disappeared but it just zipped off well without sound. Since then I have saw other types of craft and also more of the triangles also. The craft are coming progressively closer each night about 2 weeks ago I started seeing another style of craft very close every night I’m not really sure why me why they are n! ear me but every night even when I leave my home I see the triangle ships follow me through my whole trip. I had contacted mufon when all this all began at first the ships used to stay farther out but mufon sent a investigator who was amazed and confirmed the sighting of these craft. Now these craft come substantially closer every single night for the last 3 months these ships always has some type of cloud substance around them I believe they somehow create this stuff because it help conseal  them. Something I might also add ever since contacting mufon I have also been seeing a lot of drones following me which I believe could be government drones I see a very large drone a lot very very close and this drone is a large square platform type drone with a wheel at all four corners and it has multiple cameras the difference in these drones and why I believe they are government is these things are semi loud to extremely loud and all the exterterestial craft is silent. I’m not sur! e of your procedures but I hope they are different because I w! as very disappointed in how my experience with them was very underwhelming. I decided to reach out to ufo center because yesterday I believe I was possibly abducted for the second time, I contacted mufon after the first. I don’t remember but small bits but the whole day is missing for both me and my girlfriend the first abduction I had a small incision on the back on my head and she had something protruding from her ear lobe. This time she had no marks but I have a small incision to my lower left back.;35.4575251773048;-97.5284708037825
