Fast moving UFO in Porum, Ok;2003-07-08 20:49:00;2 minutes;Fast moving UFO in Porum, Ok I am not a UFO chaser, but on the evening in question I observed from a moving vehicle a disk or saucer shaped object slowly traversing the sky west of me. I am a hobby digital photographer, so I stopped my vehicle to photograph the object. I attempted to shoot a photo, but I could not obtain focus and it was unnoticable except for a half moon glow on the forward surface in the picture. This also occured on the second. I switched the camera to a 3 shot burst mode and at that time the object began to move at a high rate of speed. With the object in the viewfinder I traversed at least 85-95 degrees in less that a second following its path. Two of the 3 photos in the burst show evidence of the craft the second clearly shows the disclike shape. This is my first sighting of a UFO. Five friends and I may have witnessed one in 96 or 97 that was being apprehended by an aircraft that could not bank hard enough to keep up with it's 90 degree turns.;35.3668;-95.259
