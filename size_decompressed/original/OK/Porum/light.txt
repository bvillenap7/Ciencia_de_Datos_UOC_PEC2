reappearing bright light over hills;2003-08-03 21:30:00;45 minutes;reappearing bright light over hills I have always been very skeptical about ufo's, but here recently my mind has been opened to the idea.  For about two weeks now i have watched many diffrent lights from about 4 miles away on the side of a hill.  At times the light is so bright, it almost hurts your eyes to look at it.  It changes colors, and moves in all directions.  Me and my spouse really didn't know how to explain these strange lights.  Last night almost directly above these lights was a very bright orange round light in the sky.  As i watched it, it started to move higher and higher.  Then it instantly changed into two lights.  One yellow and one red.  Then like somebody had flipped a switch it was gone.  About 2 minutes later it reappeared in almost the same spot that it first started from.  I have lived in here all my life, and have never seen anything like this before.;35.3668;-95.259
