We just happened to see way way way out in space a single light object doing figure eights, high speed accelerations in all directions all over the place.  It kept doing this for about 5 minutes or so.   Then eventually the light object kept going further out in space until you couldn't see it anymore.  It was like teenager alien was joy-riding in his alien dads space craft.   Very cool. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.
