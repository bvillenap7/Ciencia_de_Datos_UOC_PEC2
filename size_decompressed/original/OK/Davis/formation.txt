Horizontal string of lights evenly spaced flying in a straight line.   ((Starlink satellites?));2020-10-24 21:30:00;30 seconds;Horizontal string of lights evenly spaced flying in a straight line A group of friends and I went camping at turner falls from the evenings of October 23rd through the 25th. Around 9-10 pm on Saturday the 24th a string of 15-20 spheres of light flew above us. They were all equally spaced in a straight horizontal line. It flew at about what appeared to be 30,000 feet in the air according to the air traffic controller who happened to be a part of the group. It flew above us for 20-30 seconds and then slowly faded and disappeared. It didnâ€™t shoot out of the sky or suddenly disappear, it faded into oblivion.;34.4977;-97.1046
