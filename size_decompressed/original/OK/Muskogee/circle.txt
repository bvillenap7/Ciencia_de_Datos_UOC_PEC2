2 dozen red orbs, in 2's and a group of 5, with multiple origination points and directions of travel;2012-07-04 21:30:00;1.5 hours;2 dozen red orbs, in 2's and a group of 5, with multiple origination points and directions of travel Preamble - My wife and I have, for the past 4 years, taken a short ride out in the car on 4th July evenings.  We have the intention of 'UFO spotting' as a pleasant pastime, looking for what the general public may not be looking for up in the skies.  For the past 4 years, we have seen odd, unusual objects on the Independence Day evenings.  I have a good knowledge of aircraft night illumination, types of aircraft and do fly R/C aircraft, sometimes at night.  I used to live on the approach to Manchester Airport, when living in the UK, til 2007. My wife has a similar degree of discernment regarding known standard aerial objects, including satellites, stars and high altitude aircraft. While there is the local Davis Field airport, air traffic is in the order of 1 or 2 light aircraft per day and perhaps a military or hospital helicopter on infrequent occasions.  Our skies are therefore relatively clean of commercial passenger aircraft, it being an uncommon sight to see even a contrail. Sighting this year, 2012 - We set out at 21:20 and headed South approx 5 miles, away from the city of Muskogee, Oklahoma, where we live.  By 21:35 we were positioned in a pull off area on a dark road and looking North toward the city. Wind direction was SSW at 6mph, as checked on wunderground.com and remained similar all evening.   Such a fact may be important for considerations of the report, or those from others local to the area, if they are received. Within the melee of firework activity, 2 groups of 2 red lights could be seen to be moving East to West at a distance of approx 3 miles distant.  The lights were tiny spots, slowly moving West and seperated constantly by a short distance, equating to around 20 lengths of object size.  We then saw 3 groups of the same type of lights moving from the West to the East, behaving in the same manner. Speed of travel could be estimated anywhere from wind speed, to 50mph, depending on the actual distance of the objects, which is unknown.  Slow in any case and linear, without dramatic differences in direction of travel.  A slow climb was noticed with several groups of the lights. All objects 'floated' along for 1/3rd the viewable sky, until they would disappear and all behaved in the same way. We decided to head North West, to see if we could find an origination point. My own thoughts were of Chinese lanterns, a candle inside a lightbox, suspended from a parachute or balloon.  Such a device could, feasibly be what we were watching, though wind direction would have to be changing and launch points.  However, my wife informed me that this tradition is not carried on in the United States, and especially during the drought conditions our area has been experiencing. We arrived at a veterinary clinic on Peak Boulevard and pulled in to the car park. Over our heads we witnessed 2 of the orb lights at about 50ft distance from us.  They slowly made their way Northward, no sound, glowing a bright red.  Size is estimated to be anywhere from football sized to car length sized, it being quite difficult to discern physical distance from us. We DO have video footage of that incident (uploaded to YouTube and not set to Public):  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3Jro3yEkvo  I apologize for the quality, but, it shows the distancing between 2 of the lights.  We intend to purchase a better night quality camera in the near future. We continued to head West on Peak Boulevard, past the casino and into the country, where city lights would not prohibit our view, in the hopes of again tracing any launch point of the objects. On stopping at another pull off area, we noted several groups of 2 orbs moving from another start location and then, a group of 5, closely spaced in an approximate diamond shape. We had been studying the sky behind us, moved back to face the original direction and saw the group of 5. It is unknown how they arrived in that placement or from which direction. Within 10 minutes, 2 more were seen in the sky, travelling from East to West - which completely defied the wind direction again and the previous emanation point. The total was either 23 or 24 bright red glowing balls of light, in tandems or in a group of 5. All aerial objects were sighted coming into the field of view, with none originating at ground level or from high altitude. Average flight height is deemed to be the height of firework bursts (200ft ?). The orbs were seeimingly floating in toward the city of Muskogee from many different directions, during the 1 and a 1/2hr observation period. The wind direction, being constant, removed personnal thoughts of balloon lanterns and hence is why we are posting this report.
