Sighting in afternoon with military aircraft;2020-02-07 13:00:00;5 minutes;Sighting in afternoon with military aircraft Working on the line not long after lunch. Approximately 1:00pm. We saw an object moving across the sky colored white or silver, looked like a weather ballon moving east.  Then it stopped moving, remained in pace for about 10 seconds. then it took off across the sky moving faster than anything we had seen and disappeared.  Not a minute later and it reappeared on the eastern horizon it was not moving as fast, then it picked up speed and disappeared into 5 different outward objects that disappeared completely.  The sky seemed like it had static to it and we couldn't focus on anything in the sky for a few minutes.  About 5 minutes later 3 predator drones came in hot and low in a > formation across the sky heading east.  Later in the day all 3 were seen again heading back west.;35.7370440366972;-95.3749816513764
