What looked like a typical satellite flashed and disappeared.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probable flare from Iridium satellite?  PD));2014-09-08 21:40:00;5 seconds;What looked like a typical satellite flashed and disappeared. Looking west, I saw a non-flashing white light that I thought to be a satellite heading from north to south at a steady, typical pace for objects in orbit.   I watched this light for about 5 seconds before it became extremely bright and then disappeared.   I am confident that this was not a meteor/meteorite as I have seen them before on many occasions.  This honestly looked like a regular satellite until it flashed - maybe twice the size and brightness of Venus on a winter morning - then was gone.  I have no idea what it was.
