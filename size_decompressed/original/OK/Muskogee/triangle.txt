Triangular, non-flashing lights;2018-09-02 06:47:00;30-45 seconds;Triangular, non-flashing lights On the morning of 9/2/18, at approximately 6:47 a.m., I went out on my balcony for a smoke.  As always, my eyes were to the sky looking for satellites or meteors.  My balcony faces pretty much due north, and I noticed what I thought was an aircraft moving from the southwest to the northeast.  As my eyes focused, I saw that it was triangular (or 3 white lights in a triangular shape), and none of the lights were flashing.  It did not seem to be moving any faster than a regular commercial airliner would. I have large trees in my neighborhood and it appeared just above them on the horizon.  For scale I would say it was about the size of my little fingernail held at arms length.  I'm not good at judging distance, but If I had to guess, it would have been southeast of Tulsa.  If you drew a line from OKC to Tulsa, this seemed to be the path it was on. There was nothing extraordinary about its speed or movement.  I just thought the triangular shape and non-flashing lights were odd and I would report it in case anyone else saw it.;35.7370440366972;-95.3749816513764
