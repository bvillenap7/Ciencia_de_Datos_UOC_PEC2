Star like,very large and extremely bright;2003-11-23 18:30:00;2-3 min;Star like,very large and extremely bright I am at my Father-in-laws and stepped outside to smoke a cigarette. I go to the back fence to pet the dog then turn around and look up to the sky as is my habit.I like to look at the stars every night I can. I see what at first is a extremely bright star with a magnitude similar to Sirius but actually brighter. I am thinking to myself that it should'nt be there when I notice it's moving from south to north.I'm thinking this is impossible. So I step inside the door and holler at my Father-in-law and tell him he has got to come out and look at this. He is a total non believer in anything such as UFO's and the like. He comes out and I point it out to him. I ask him what do you think it is? We agree it is definitly not a plane(no sound) but it looks just like a giant star. He says maybe it's a satellite but I have saw them before and I don't think so.It's too big and too bright. We watch it until it goes out of sight.He goes back in and about a minute or so after it disappeared I heard and saw a jet on a course that could be like it was keeping an eye on the thing.One more thing my father in law mentioned that he thought he could see like a tail on it.I have better eyesight than him but who knows.;35.7370440366972;-95.3749816513764

Cluster of 20 or more multicolored lights hovering in same area for 20 or more minutes.;2012-09-13 04:20:00;20 minutes;Cluster of 20 or more multicolored lights hovering in same area for 20 or more minutes. Saw a cluster of multicolored lights to the east of Muskogee, OK like they were hovering over Braggs, OK. The lights stayed in same spot for 20 minutes. Looking through binoculars, it appeared to be over 20 or more lights. Some of the lights were flashing and certain colors were steady.;35.7370440366972;-95.3749816513764
What was thought to be a satellite, stopped completely in its travels and sat stationary for a full minute.;2013-09-23 20:40:00;2 minutes;What was thought to be a satellite, stopped completely in its travels and sat stationary for a full minute. A sighting which would have gone unreported probably, but for hearing about the sightings in Austin Texas tonight on Coast to Coast AM. Perhaps the following is a useful inclusion, depending on whether it fits in with other reported sightings.  My usual trip outside to view satellites in our backyard included an odd event tonight. I lay down on the garden long chair, as has been a usual thing this Summer and which also blocks out a street light by doing so (yard fence in the way). At 20:40 I saw what looked 100% like a satellite, crossing above me heading North to South. Brightness, movement speed etc were perfectly normal. It moved overhead and down, to approximately 35 degrees above the horizon. It then stopped, completely stopped its travel and sat in the sky motionless to the eye. The luminance was exactly the same for the next full 1 minute as when it had been travelling. Then, still without moving, it slowly faded in brightness til fully disappearing, taking approximately 20 seconds to do so.  I mention the experience, because Austin Texas is only a few degrees from due South of us here in Oklahoma and usual satellite orbits can place their viewing to many hundreds of miles away. The stopping has never been witnessed before, though fading can happen sometimes depending on viewing time after sunset. I'm well versed in satellite spotting, with a favourite being the ancient Atlas Centaur 2, using www.satview.org to determine viewing time. Regarding recognising aircraft, I have extensive experience of aircraft identification over my 44 years, with many years of R/C aircraft building and having lived on the flightpath to Manchester Airport in England before moving to the USA.  Clouds moved in over the next few minutes after the event and i've been unable to view the sky for the rest of the evening.;35.7370440366972;-95.3749816513764
