Large rectangular slow moving craft over farm;2018-07-13 21:45:00;5 minutes;Large rectangular slow moving craft over farm When turning our horses out into the pasture at approximately 9:45 pm, my wife and I looked up and saw a large craft, approximately 300 feet long and 2500 feet high, moving slowly from SSW to NNE.  It made a very low none engine sound.  Did not sound like a jet.     The craft was moving extremely slowly, with 3 white lights in front in a triangle formation, and 4 white lights in the rear in a perfect square, the space between  the front and rear lights was black with no stars visible.  Had one red light flashing in the bottom center of the 4 white lights in the rear of the craft.    Also observed flashes of light in the area until craft was no longer visible overhead.;35.6558;-97.3263
