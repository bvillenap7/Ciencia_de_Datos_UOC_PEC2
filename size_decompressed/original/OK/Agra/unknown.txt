Falling fire ball or stream;2012-11-08 23:57:00;45-60 seconds;Falling fire ball or stream I was driving home about 2-3 miles south of 33 highway on 18 highway south. I observed a light on the passenger side and looked over assuming break lights.  The entire window was bright red and orange. In a few seconds or more I had come to a stop and watched it dwendel down to a fine stream at about a 15* angle.  It flashed with some heat and slowly faded away.   I waited in the middle of the road for a few minutes looking for a smoke trail in the clear night sky.  Or an impact flash or smoke.   Nothing. I then called my wife to apologize for not believing her white orb with a colorful trail of triangles that was aimed for the field next to our property back in October.   I checked that our the next day and found nothing. I will check out the area around where I saw this in the morning or afternoon job permitting.;35.907;-96.8748
