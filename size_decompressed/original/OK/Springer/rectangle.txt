My wife and I were leaving our home.  As I  finished loading items in our hatchback, I  happened to look above our home in a 45 degree angle up and to the right, which was north.  The day was beautiful clear and blue, that is when I saw an object moving in a super fast speed.  That day being clear from my drive it was clear, whereas I could see Ardmore which is south and 10 miles away clear as a bell.   Anyway the object was solid brilliant white only, but a portion on the front of the object had a portion in the front of the object that angled about 60 degrees.  The object was NW of me moving to the SE at a high speed, it had no lights nor did it make any noise.   At that time I  was behind my car calling for my wife to come here, she was fooling around locking the door.  She came and I pointed it out to her.  It was, I would say, three to four miles high and 4 to 5 miles from us.  As we were looking at it, the object suddenly change direct heading due west.  We lost sig! ht after a few minutes still no sound or exhaust from the object.;34.3145;-97.1428
