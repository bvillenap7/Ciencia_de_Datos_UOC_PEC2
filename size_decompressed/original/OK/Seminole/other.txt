Saw 7 separate star like objects travel North to South & South to North within a 30 minute period;2012-03-26 20:00:00;25 minutes;Saw 7 separate star like objects travel North to South & South to North within a 30 minute period This latest sighting is the second one in a matter of days, though different in nature.  My husband and I have been watching the sky very closely since our last sighting in broad daylight March 24, 2012, which consisted of a large flock of dimming and glowing round objects.  This time, we were observing the night sky on the evening of March 26, 2012 and saw 7 separate objects that looked like stars but were moving at a steady pace high above in the sky.  Between a 25-30 minute period, each one was either traveling North to South or South to North and seemed as though each was following the same specific path.  The second starry object to be seen was traveling South, and emitted a flash of light a little further ahead of it, so I thought maybe it was a satellite taking a picture, as it looked like a camera flash.  The 5th object was traveling North, and when it was directly above our home my husband flashed a light on & off to see if it would notice.  In all seriousness, the object slowed to a near stop, brightened tremendously, then dimmed and continued it's course!   We feel very special seeing this activity, though we don't really know or understand what it is.  We saw 4 different planes travel through, 2 going East to West and 2 going South to North, but the little star like objects weren't present at the time the planes were out.;35.2504;-96.666
