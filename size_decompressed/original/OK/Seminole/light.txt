Last night around 01:19 there was a very loud humming outside my window, i got curious and decided to investigate.  Before i opened my blinds to peer out into the field that is behind my window there was loud forceful gushes of wind, this i didn't think much if due to the fact that i live in Oklahoma. I quickly opened my blinds and in the middle of the field there was a blindingly bright green light low to the ground that looked to just be hovering that stayed there for anywhere between six to twenty seconds.  The craft then seemed to vanish as if it was dissolving and flying towards the sky quickly to the right at a diagonal.  After seeing the craft i began to try to sleep but the humming sound outside of my window wouldn't stop and it felt as if i was being watched though i felt very calm paranoidia set in.;35.2504;-96.666

The further we drove the higher it rose until I told him to pull over so we could watch and see what it was. As soon as we did that it disappeared. It was not blinking or flashing. It was bright and big enough to tell that it wasn't a star or something else. It went straight up and as soon as we stopped to watch it was gone!;35.2504;-96.666
