Bluish white disk with trail behind it.;2013-10-23 19:28:00;2.5 seconds;Bluish white disk with trail behind it Bluish white half saucer.  Electric blue and white on it.  Saw it for 2 and a half seconds.  Faster than any jet I have ever seen and I live by an Air Force base.  It had a long trail behind it.   It went from left to right we were facing North.  It was really far away and it disappeared.   I saw it with my Dad when we were out walking our dog, ((dog's name deleted)).

Bluish white disk with contrail moving west to east.;2013-10-23 19:28:00;2-3 seconds;Bluish white disk with contrail moving west to east. A side view of a classic saucer shape, bottom edges tapered down with a raised top section.  Followed by a contrail 7 to 10 times the length of the craft.  The craft was 3 times brighter than the contrail.   The color of the craft was a glowing bluish white.  Did not strobe,  flash or have visible markings or windows.  No occupants seen.   Craft was incredibly fast.   Seen in the northern sky at dusk.  Moved from west to east horizontally flat in travel.  The craft completely disappeared did not fade or burn out.  From the horizon to looking directly above (90 degs) the craft was at 55 to 60 degs.   Seen by myself and my son.   Thank you Mr. D for taking my report over the phone.
