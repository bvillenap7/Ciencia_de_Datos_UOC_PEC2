Singular craft moving at high rate of speed with a firey glow;2007-07-03 22:00:00;20 seconds;Singular craft moving at high rate of speed with a firey glow While setting off fireworks in Choctaw, OK on July 3rd, 2007 at approximately 2200 to 2215 3 adults and 4 children witnessed the object what at first seemed like a plane.   The speed at which it was traveling and no apparent sound coming from it soon changed our mind.  A hot air balloon was mentioned, but again the speed was too great for a hot air ballon.   It traveled from the SE sky to the NW sky within our field of sight in a matter of seconds.  It did not appear to travel in a straight line, nor was it heading in a usual path that planes travel.  It was glowing in a fiery ball, which it seemed like a plane- one of the chidren age 13 thought they saw wings.  Once I started fillig in this report, it did have a chevron shape as it was passing over.;35.4718;-97.2725999999999
