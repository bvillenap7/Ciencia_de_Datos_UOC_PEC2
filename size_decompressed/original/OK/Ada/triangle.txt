Traingular Craft hovered over the tree line in the Ada, OK Area;2004-10-18 17:45:00;3 Min;Traingular Craft hovered over the tree line in the Ada, OK Area Looking South into the evening sky (clear) while doing some late BBQ, I noticed a white light off in the distance comming twards me. I was trying to figure out why this plane had such a bright light. As it got closer the light seemed to get smaller, then I started to panic a bit thinking if this is a plane it's going to crash in my back yard, then it just stopped! I told my son (9) to turn the back porch light off so we could see this thing better. After looking for a few moments we figured out that it was  no airplane. There was no noise and it was hovering, my 9 year old was stunned as I, my 2 1/2 year old was terrified, when we saw this blackish grey triangular craft bobbling, or doing some sort of rotation, then locked in a trajectory and shot out of sight. I have never seen anything like it in my life. After looking about for 10-15 minutes, we noticed 2 military type jets flying patterns....but no sign of the unidentified object.;34.7838;-96.6938
