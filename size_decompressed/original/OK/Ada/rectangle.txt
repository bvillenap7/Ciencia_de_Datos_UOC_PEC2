Unexplainable;2003-05-07 21:05:00;1-3 minutes;Unexplainable I do not believe in aliens.  Until now.  As my best friend and I drove along a well traveled highway I saw some lights out of the corner of my eye.  I figured it was an airplane because it was moving through the sky and it was fairly low, however there was an airport close so I thought maybe that was the cause.  I really didn't pay that much attention until my best friend asked me what it was.  I looked again and the object had come to a complete stop.  It looked to have a search light of some sort.  She stopped the car and we came a stop in the middle of the highway.  The object made no sound.  We continued to stare at the object we then decided to turn around and come back.  To turn around and drive back by the sight where we saw the object took a maximum of 45 seconds and the object was gone from sight.  If the object had been a helicopter not only could we have felt to force of the spinning propeller but when the helicopter flew off we would have seen it in the sky.  Airplanes don't hover.;34.7838;-96.6938

As I was driving I saw a rectangular object, horizontally falling from the sky. The object was bright green, and after about 10 seconds of watching it come down it then flashed and disappeared.;34.7838;-96.6938
