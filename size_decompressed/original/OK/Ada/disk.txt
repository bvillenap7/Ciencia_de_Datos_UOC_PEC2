White, disk shaped object above Ada, OK.;2012-06-30 13:50:00;2 - 3 minutes;White, disk shaped object above Ada, OK. My wife and I were traveling south on US377 toward Ada.  She spotted a white (possibly aluminum) colored object east of the Highway. It was a profile view of what appeared to be a saucer shaped craft.  It could also be described as cigar shaped from our view.   I initially thought it was a white blimp. We stopped to observe it.  After a minute or so of no motion, it rapidly (nearly instantly) accelerated straight up into a cloud.   We could still see it as the cloud dissipated.  A few seconds later it vanished. It appeared to be near the Ada airport, but it was difficult to determine its distance or size, but seemed to be quite large.  In excess of a football field in length.;34.7838;-96.6938
