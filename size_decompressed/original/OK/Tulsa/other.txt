It was maybe 500ft above me, no lights, traveling VERY slow,  and completely silent.;1999-10-12 22:15:00;30 seconds;It was maybe 500ft above me, no lights, traveling VERY slow,  and completely silent. I was 18 at the time, and a senior in high school.  I was working at a mall in Tulsa, OK.  I had just left work around 10pm to go over to my girlfriend’s house for a few hours.  It was October 12, 1999, and Halloween was fast approaching.  She had decided to go as Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz. When I arrived at her house, she was outside gluing glitter to a pair of red heels for her costume.  I sat on her front steps with her while she did this.  When she was done, I suggested that we lie in the driveway and look at the stars.  It was relatively warm for that time of year, and the sky was as clear as can be. We got up and moved to the driveway.  As we lay there, looking at the stars and talking, I noticed something disturbing the night sky.  It was moving VERY slowly, maybe 100MPH or less.  The object was very low to the ground.  My guess is between 500ft and 750ft, but no more than that.  There were no lights, and no sound.  I could make out the silhouette of the object against the distant light pollution and the stars in the background.  It had a long fuselage with bulges to the side, kind of in the shape of lobes, where the cockpit might be, and at the back of the object.  The bulges to the side were smaller in the front than in the rear.  It had a slight glow behind it, though not like a jet.  I asked her if she was seeing what I was seeing.  She saw it as well.  We watched as the object slowly and silently moved through the night sky until it was out of sight. The fact that stood out to me was the complete lack of sound.  As a child I frequented air shows.  I was quite aware of the immense noise produced by a conventional engine, be it propeller or jet.  I had seen an F-14 perform a fly by at 100MPH once.  It was greatly pitched with a tremendous amount of thrust, and was loud enough to wake the dead.  What we saw that night was lower, slower, and not pitched at all. I don’t think it was alien spacecraft, but the technology was nothing known to exist to this day.  A few weeks later I saw a show on TV about the “Aurora”, the top secret space plane.  The supposed shape of the Aurora, according to the show, was nearly identical to what we had seen.  My guess is that we may have witnessed a test flight of this plane.  The only thing that keeps me from being sure of that is that there were no lights on it.  I know the US puts lights on all aircraft, even test planes.  We’ve seen this with the F-117.  This Unidentified Flying Object is wholly worthy of the title.  Not a flying saucer.  Not cigar shaped.  Not a light that moves at break-neck speed.  It was just an unidentified, slow flying, silent object.;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546
A large metallic cigar/blimp like object that hovered in the air for 15 to 20 seconds and then shrunk into dispearnace in 1.5 seconds.;2012-12-18 09:00:00;15-20 seconds;A large metallic cigar/blimp like object that hovered in the air for 15 to 20 seconds and then shrunk into dispearnace in 1.5 seconds. At about 8:00 am (09:00) I was driving to school in Tulsa Oklahoma when I spotted a flying about hovering in the sky.  I observed the object for about 15 to 20 seconds.  I noticed the object was kind of cigar shaped but fatter in the middle almost blimp like but I have seen a blimp before and it was not a blimp.  The object was metallic and I could see the sun reflecting off ofthe surface of the object.  After oberving the object for 15 to 20 seconds the object shrunk until it disapeared.  The shrinking process occured in about a second and a half and it was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides ittle contact information.

Large airplane flying low to ground stopping in mid-air hovering for a few seconds then continuing to fly.;2012-12-20 18:00:00;2 minutes;Large airplane flying low to ground stopping in mid-air hovering for a few seconds then continuing to fly. At 7:00 pm on December 20 2012 me my father and his girlfriend witnessed an airplane that was flying oddly low.   We watched the plane for a few seconds then the plane stopped completely in mid-air.  The large airplane hovered in the sky for a few seconds then rapidly sped up only to stop and hover again for a few more seconds.   My Dad has had aviation training and is familar with flight patterns and manuvers of human aircraft.  The reason I am reporting this on a UFO website is because airplanes can not stop and hover in mid-air. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

UFO over Tulsa, Oklahoma at 12:58am 12/21/12;2012-12-21 00:58:00;10 minutes;UFO over Tulsa, Oklahoma at 12:58am 12/21/12 I was on Facebook when I had a sudden urge to go outside.  It was already past midnight, so I thought to myself (okay I will go have a last cigarette before I head off to bed.). So I stepped out of my front door that face's west and started to look at the moon as it was setting. Oddly my attention was pulled to the N.W. I saw a red light going toward the airport. I naturally thought it was a plane. Then I noticed there were no flashing lights.  I said aloud, Okay... Now I'm watching you.. Once I had said that it changed from heading East to S.E. then to South.  It was heading towards me.  I stepped further out into the front yard to get a better look as it went above my house.  I quickly ran in woke up my father and grabbed a camera.   By the time I got back outside it was gone nowhere to be seen even from the roof.  Later a plane went by higher up then it was I could see the flashing lights on it and hear the sound as it passed.  Description - Very bright red light 3 times bigger then any airplane or helicopter spotlight at the altitude it was traveling.  No noise emitted from the Craft.  Massive dark shape behind the red light.  Blocked out stars as it passed overhead. 5 times faster then any witnessed plane bomber jet (commercial/Fighter ). No tail/tracers from the light.  Single light 1/6 the size of craft.;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546
Green light raveling from East to West.;2014-06-16 21:15:00;5 seconds;Green light raveling from East to West. My wife and I looking due south in East Tulsa seen a elongated greenish light traveling from the East to directly West.  Lasted approximately 5 seconds.  We are normal folks just looking in the sky and bam!   There it was, silent and seemingly losing altitude throughout its trajectory.   At some point in western sky it vanished.;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546

Looked like 2 kites;2017-04-27 11:00:00;5 minutes;looked like 2 kites On April 27th, 2017, around 11am, I was heading to work, I was on a city bus 306 when 2 objects cought my eye at the east they looked like kite`s with a tail attached to it, at first so i did not think anything of it but one of the objects was at a standstill and did not move the other object would orbit around it.  They seem pretty far away and up in the sky i say around 10,000 feet.  I tryed to take a picture but it did not show in the picture by the time i got off the bus 5 minutes later the objects where not in site.;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546
Appeared as a very large whistling meteor turned almost 90° and then appeared and sounded as very fast moving aircraft over Oklahoma.;2018-08-11 04:49:00;5 seconds;Appeared as a very large whistling meteor turned almost 90° and then appeared and sounded as very fast moving aircraft over Oklahoma Looked like a falling star then got larger, brighter appeared to be orange sparks behind it sort of like a bottle rocket but by now about the size of what I would imagine a small aircraft in a Terminal predicament would look like.  A blue hue appeared behind it around the orange and a whistle sound could now be heard.  The blue diminished and the orange sparks started to lessen.  Front point had turned into what appeared to be a growing glowing white round light which at first was a small circle of light but dark in the center and progressed into being all white light as the Sparks continue to diminish.  By now the whistle turned into a hum that sounded similar to a small aircraft not in distress.  When the orange sparks disappeared the hum continued and all that was left was a blueish or green light and a small gold/white/gold/white light and only for a moment a red light.   From there it proceeded out of sight, trees were blocking my view, looking and sounding like a small aircraft but moving much faster than any plane that I've ever known of and the hum diminished respectively with the sight of it.  It first appeared moving South and barely East from my location as it appeared to drop down and made almost a 90 degrees curve to head East but a little North.  About 1/8 of the way towards North from due East.I don't know latitudes and longitudes.  It did only travel in two straight very distinctive lines.  The turn was maneuvered at the point where the orange sparks were brightest and largest immeditely after the turn is when the blue hue appeared and sparks right after that started to diminish and as the sparks start to diminish is when the whistle turn into a hum.   After the Sparks diminished that's when it turned into the bluish light the flashing light which went dark and the red light which only blinked once left only a bluish-green light.  White circle appeared just barely before the blue hue was completely gone, the white circle was! gone when the lights started appearing in the other colors at! the fro nt point.  The colored lights were in the form of a small triangle with unequal sides when the red light blinked but the white and gold appeared in different relations to the bluish green light. I heard the whistle for about one-and-a-half seconds and about 75% of that time was before the curve and about 25% after.  The curve was made instantly. Same amount of time it would take a second hand on a clock to go to the next second after it started to move but before it hit the next second, that's how long it took the curve to be accomplished. If a possible altitude is necessary I can only guess and that would be it appeared from nowhere to begin to fall from the sky and after the curve would be below the average cloud level. It occurred during a clear night, no clouds and could see stars.  Please reply to this message?  I know I can't leave personal info in a message, but I would like to know what that was or at least that someone has looked into it.  And especially for any questions ! or comments that you might have.  Thank you.;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546
