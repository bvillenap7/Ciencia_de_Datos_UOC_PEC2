Hundreds of glowing white objects in dozens of formations silently traveled for 15-20 minutes over Tulsa, Ok., 10/31/03 or 11/7/03.;2003-11-07 22:00:00;15 minutes plus;Hundreds of glowing white objects in dozens of formations silently traveled for 15-20 minutes over Tulsa, Ok., 10/31/03 or 11/7/03. My husband was getting ready to leave to go to his work as a Security Guard here in Tulsa.  I was already outside with our dog when I looked up and saw several formations of glowing lights (white) in a pattern resembling an arc &/or a V shape. They made no sound whatsoever.  I called to my husband to come outside and look.  He was as spell bound as I was.  He witnessed the same thing.  We watched until they stopped flying over.  They were very high and very fast flying north to south.  There were hundreds of individual objects.  There was an airplane in the sky at some point when they were flying over, the objects were traveling at a much greater speed than the plane.  I know he had to have seen them!!  After my husband left for work, I rushed in to see if they would report it on the news.  NOTHING!  I am not sure of the date but the sighting took place the week of the last sun spots (magnetic) on a Friday night.  Friday week or the last Friday in October. It was a very clear night during that time, so we know there has to be others who saw these UFO's.  We are a retired military couple and know what helicopters and planes look like in the sky at night, these things were neither. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Three adults allegedly witness three formations of points of light pass overhead at high speed.;2004-02-14 20:00:00;10-15 min.;Three adults allegedly witness three formations of points of light pass overhead at high speed. Telephoned Report:  Tulsa, OK, Saturday, February 14, 2004  Three adults telephone the National UFO Reporting Center to report that they allegedly had witnessed approximately 60-100 (est.) objects pass overhead, from north to south, at a “rather fast” pace across the sky.  They described how one of the three adults, at approximately 8:00 p.m. (local) had observed a cluster of approximately 10 objects, each of which had the appearance of a star, move across the sky at a rapid pace.  The witness was so struck by the event that he went inside to alert two other adults to what had just occurred, and all three of them moved outside to scan the sky for the objects.  Within minutes, all three witnesses observed a second, similar group, moving in the same direction.  Shortly after the second sighting, the three witnesses sighted a third group, which appeared to form a circle of lights, as it streaked across the sky.  The entire event occurred over 10-15 minutes, the witnesses estimated.  Despite repeated requests from NUFORC for follow-up written reports, the witnesses have not submitted formal statements, despite their assurances that they would.  No other reports were received from Oklahoma for the same time and date. Report entered by Peter Davenport, NUFORC Director.;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546
Line formation of Lights in Tulsa,Ok.;2008-09-16 01:35:00;10 minutes;Line formation of Lights in Tulsa,Ok. Initially I seen 3 white lights at staggered heights, but still close to one another.  Then they kind of faded out then appeared again within about 30 seconds and spread out in a single file line and multiplied to 6 or 7 lights all slightly blinking.  The lights then moved in line from west to east with no sound.  I am just south of Tulsa Airport and at first thought it was a jet that was taking off because I did hear a rumbling sound when I had first seen the lights.  But when the lights split into multiple lights I humorously thought a jet might have been sent to investigate the lights.  I do not know who to contact to see if there was a series of jets that took off that morning.  Surely they would not allow 6 or 7 jets to take flight at 1:30am with surrounding residential areas so close to the airport.;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546
Light formation.;2012-06-12 15:30:00;seconds;Light formation I was photographing clouds when I noticed in the shot I took 6 lights in sets of two.  They were all white in color, and were in the clouds a few seconds and disappeared.  There was no sound, and they were high in the sky.;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546
Flashing lights in formation moving west to east over a 6 minute period in Tulsa OK;2012-06-27 23:42:00;6 minutes;Flashing lights in formation moving west to east over a 6 minute period in Tulsa OK My wife saw 2 flashing lights in the sky in formation moving from West to East.  We were located at our home approximately 2 blocks south, and 2 blocks east of the intersection of 51 & Sheridan Road, in Tulsa, OK.  I was in bed, she called me out excitedly.  As I came outside, and walked to the end of our driveway and looked due south, she said look at that.. it looked like two strobe lights in the sky the lower left and upper right lights were intermittently flashing, red, blue, red, red, blue, white, and the flashing pattern was in sync for about 10 seconds my wife said.  She walked to the house called me, I came out and saw them stationary with NO sound.  The objects were at least a few miles in the air about 40degrees up from our vantage point at the end of the driveway.  I came outside saw them stationary... then they two objects started spreading apart... I immediately ran back inside to get my video camera and my $5K Canon 5DMark II digital slr camera! , and tried to take a video... as I got back outside (while my wife kept them in sight), they started moving to the east, south east at about 70-80 miles per hour, and I tried to setup my video camera to catch them... however couldn't focus on anything... I got my SLR camera out and changed lenses to my 70-200... and tried to get a 1080P hd movie going... but couldn't focus on anything... by the time I had the video going... they were at least 6-8 miles away... in less than 2-3 minutes. I had to walk south down our street to view them through the tree line.. and could still make out the blue, red, blue, red, white, blue, red, alternating flashing....  my wife was videoing and trying to see anything while I continued to try to take some time delayed stills to see if I could amplify the ambient light but couldn't.  I was outside watching the flashing until My eyes could barely make out a faint white flashing of 2-3 objects... in the far distance.  This all occurred within abo! ut 6 minutes!!   This is my wife and our 3rd sighting in the l! ast 3 mo nths now.  Last one in Arkansas, and 3 months ago directly above our home at 51 & Sheridan... what is going on?  No Noise?  and Bright star like objects moving in irregular ways...;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546
Armada of Star-like Objects Moving Across Oklahoma Night Sky;2012-10-05 20:08:00;<2 minutes;Armada of Star-like Objects Moving Across Oklahoma Night Sky At approximately 8:08 central time, my son and I were sitting in our van at the intersection of 129th and 71st in the Broken Arrow, Tulsa area waiting for the light to change.  I was driving and we were facing west in the left hand through lane.  There was a moderate cloud cover. While waiting at the stop light my son, who is 17, said something to the effect of, Dad, what the heck is that/are those?   After a few seconds of confusion in trying to locate what he was looking at in the night sky, I observed what he saw.   With due west as the 12 o’clock position, I estimate that a group of objects were at about the 2 o’clock position about 55 to 65 degrees in elevation from the horizon moving from north to south.  Speed was difficult to assess because we didn’t know how far away the objects were - although while I was sitting at the light which couldn’t have been more than 20 seconds, they had traversed from the 2 o’clock position to about the 11 o’clock position in the sky as observed through my windshield. When I first observed the objects I thought they might be fireworks because they seemed to be flickering or pulsing - but then I noted they were moving in unison - although not in a regular formation in the sky.  Then I thought maybe they were lighted, radio-controlled aircraft that I had observed in the past in a field near our home.  But since I knew these planes  moved in a bobbing, irregular manner that did not explain these objects. When they were at the 11 o’clock position I started counting them before the light changed to green.  My recollection was I got up to about a dozen - but my perception was there were even more present - though they were faint.  I think they were at least 15 objects and maybe even up to 30 in the position we were observing them.  The sky was literally peppered with them in portions of that area of the sky.   I perceived the lights to be about the size and brightness of an easily visible star. The amount of sky they occupied would be approximately equivalent to both of one’s hands - or maybe closer to a hand and a half - covering such a section.  The length of the loose formation was greater than its width from what I could see.  I perceived the color of the lights to be a light green - although  my son thought they were more like neon purple.  I thought they were pulsing or blinking in unison at a what I think was a rate of 2-3 pulses per second.  Aaron thought this effect was from them passing in and out of the cloud cover. After the light turned green I caught glimpses of the lights again - although it was difficult to focus on them because I was driving.  Aaron saw them more clearly but we were moving so visual confirmation was difficult to maintain for him as well.  Light pollution didn’t help either.  About a quarter of mile down the road, we turned in behind a school to see if we could still observe the phenomenon but they had apparently disappeared behind the cloud cover or moved too far distant for us to observe them further. I would estimate the total time of the incident to be about one to two minutes from beginning to end of the observation. My son is a student at the local high school and an interested skeptic in such phenomenon.  I am a 49 year old  27 year teacher who has an admittedly avid interest in the topic of UFOs and although I’ve seen some unusual lights in the sky?  None I can’t explain as conventional artificial, meteorological, biological, or astronomical objects - until now.  The only conventional explanation I can think of for these object would be a formation of military helicopters.  They were definitely not airplanes or jets (moving too slowly), birds (unless pigeons have suddenly evolved luminescence in Oklahoma!), balloons, or meteors.;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546
Bright fast light making full circle in mid town in under 5 min;2013-08-01 01:30:00;5 minutes;Bright fast light making full circle in mid town in under 5 min While getting on the highway the craft was spotted. Our vehicle was getting on 412 east bound to 244-E when it came from West Tulsa making a counter clockwise large circle over Utica St. and then off towards North Tulsa where it made a full circle and headed back east. It moved extremely fast, it was all white lights, two constant bright white cigar shaped lights that made a slight \/ shape but more open, almost flat but you could still see the slight v shape and blinking lights that seems to rotate around the middle just about the v shape, in an off on flashing pattern.  As it headed north, a helicopter came from the south and attempted to follow it, but the unknown craft was much more fast than the helicopter could travel, and it was gone. Mind you, this traveled from west Tulsa, first climbing upward emitting a yellow color, then it took off towards down town in a white color and made a full circle in less than 5 minutes, I've never seen a craft so fast, fly so low, with out making a sound...;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546
Four reddish lights in square formation in NW sky.;2014-10-24 21:00:00;2 seconds;Four reddish lights in square formation in NW sky. Saw 4 red or orange lights grouped together in a square formation in the NW sky they did not flash.  There was an airplane flying by the formation at what looked like a pretty good distance away from them.  I got a good look at the formation for a few seconds and then all of sudden the reddish lights went black and were gone.
