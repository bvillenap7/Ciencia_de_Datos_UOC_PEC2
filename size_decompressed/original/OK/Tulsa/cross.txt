I was out in my back yard looking for satellites and shooting stars with a night vision device.  I had seen several satellites before I noticed the most remarkable shape emerging from behind my roofline.  Looking toward the east, I saw a perfect V-shape at approximately 50 degrees up from ground level and moving in what I would guess to be a south-southwest to north-northeast direction.  The V was laying on its right side.  It looked like a flying less than symbol.  Only two edges were visible.  From what I could tell, there was no third line to connect the two arms.  There were no lights on it.  It moved very smoothly in only one direction.  It had to be very large.  There was no noise whatsoever.  I tried to see if the area between the two arms would block out light as it passed between my position and a star.  It looked as though the starlight was blocked out until both arms passed the star.  Only the two edges were distinctly visible, but they were very straight, very symmetrical and came to a very sharp point.  I'm not sure that I would have seen it without the night vision device.  I couldn't say how far away it was, but my feeling was that it was many miles away and quite high.  The sight of it was actually stunning.  I truly could not place this object anywhere within my frame of reference.  I've never seen anything remotely like it.  I can't believe that anything this large and so incredibly unique would escape the attention of our military.  After having seen this object and thinking about it for several days, I really think its time somebody in a position of responsibility stepped forward with some real answers.;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546
plane/bird shaped opbject--no lights travelling fast;2002-11-21 18:20:00;1 minute;plane/bird shaped opbject--no lights travelling fast I was watching a large number of planes in our airspace when I noticed an aircraft that I thought at first was a large bird--it was too large for as it got closer.  Then it looked like  plane with no lights and then I sa that it changed shape slightly.  It was like a white or grey shadowy figure travelling at a high rate of speed and disapeared slowly.;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546
T-shaped object, moving slow, with one red one green and four white lights.;2016-03-27 22:30:00;5 minutes;T-shapes object, moving slow, with one red one green and four white lights. My husband and I were out on our patio off in the distance which looked like a plane at first.  When it got closer it was moving slow probably 10 mph close to the ground.   When it got over us we saw circular lights one red, one green and four white lights under the craft and the craft looked T-shaped.  When it passed over our house it seemed to look like it just stopped moving from a distance.  We got in our car to follow it, but we couldn't find it.;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546
