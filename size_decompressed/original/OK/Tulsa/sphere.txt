Spherical bluish green craft hovering over the water;1996-05-15 03:00:00;5min;Spherical bluish green craft hovering over the water Approx 4 years ago me and my mother was night fishing under the highway 20 bridge at skiatook lake. it was early in the am and we were originally facing north with a slight south wind. the wind changed direction and pushed our small boat around facing south when we both saw a sphere hovering approx 10ft above the water. the craft alternated in a bluish green hue. The craft remained motionless and beneath the craft the water appeared to boil. After approx 4 min the craft moved slowly off in the westly direction. As the craft elevated the color changed to a redish orange color. The craft the went past a hill and was not seen again.;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546
UFO mimicking fireworks;2012-07-04 21:45:00;4 minutes;UFO mimicking fireworks I think I just saw a UFO?!  Yes, yes.... I know it's the 4th of July and everyone is shooting off fireworks – At 9:45pm, I was heading north on Harvard Ave. near Pine St. and I noticed this sparkly orb in the sky about a 1/2 mile up, I thought to myself That's a cool firework -- but it just hung there and kept changing colors. Well, maybe it's one of those with a Parachute attached too it?   I got to Harvard and Apache and it was still there, so I pulled over and got out of my car, looked at it for about 10 seconds and it was changing colors and all... then a large burst firework went off in the sky about a half block to my right -- then suddenly, in a blink..the orb shot north about a 1/3 of a mile, paused, in less then a second, it then took off further north about 5 miles -- then it was gone. I thought to myself, That was no firework, plane, or helicopter... I think I just saw a UFO -- and it was mimicking the fireworks?!  Weird!   Anyway, being the artist that I am, I duplicated what I saw, and it's dead on!  (I will send an email of this);36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546
12 orange orbs above downtown.;2014-06-05 21:00:00;10 minutes;12 orange orbs above downtown. Above some buildings in downtown.  12 orange spheres flying about what seemed randomly.   They were giving off light, I was able to see them faintly from my front porch more than an hour later.   They seemed to hover above one building but flew about randomly in a large radius.  They would die below the roof of the building.   The sky has no clouds, and they almost seemed like flying orange stars.    A co-worker and I both stared in awe at the phenomena ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546

We saw a strange coppery, round object far away and close to the horizon.  It had a round object that either reflected or glowed red attached on each side by a short pole.  After a few minutes of going further away, the two side objects were released and slowly floated up into the sky until we could no longer see them.  The main object soon sped up and passed beyond the horizon, out of sight. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546
Two fast moving green and silver orbs pass over Tulsa, Oklahoma.;2017-07-23 20:05:00;7 minutes;Two fast moving green and silver orbs pass over Tulsa, Oklahoma. I am a 52-year-old researcher/data collection specialist.  I was sitting with my 78-year-old mother and 13 year old son on our back porch. I was looking to the southeast and two green glowing orbs appeared from behind a neighbor’s roofline.  From my prospective, they appeared to be glowing green orbs with a barely noticeable silver edge around one edge of the green glowing circle as if a sliver of the side of the object was observable.  The silver part seemed solid like it was metal. It is clear that they were several miles away.  They were also very high up.  It was a hot hazy day with hazy clouds high in the sky.  The objects were clearly observed being obscured by the clouds at times.  The two orbs stayed the same distance from each other throughout the observation.  They moved much quicker than an airplane but the movement was steady not jerking around like perhaps a laser pointer might look. The orbs were heading towards us and the closer they got, the more obvious the details became.  It also was more obvious that the objects were very high up.  Once overhead, my perception was that they were not very big, maybe the size of a car.  At no time did we hear any sound coming from them. A middle aged couple was out for a walk and noticed my family looking at the sky.  They turned around and I asked them to look for the lights.  They saw them too.  We all stood and watched the lights move quickly but steadily towards us and over the house until we could not see them anymore.  My son said that right before they disappeared from our view, they circled each other.  This is the only observation that they broke the formation that we observed throughout.  My son is the only one who saw them circle each other.;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546

Therefore, I couldn't identify it. I'm sitting in my truck in the drive about to come inside. The wife just came up to me asking what I'm moving so slow for.  I AM a joker by nature, I love to be weird and get laughs so I'm screwing with her, doing my country(er) accent thing.  Then I see a faint glowing reflection off the top of my driver mirror paint.  Just car headlights somewhere..kk. THEN my wife looks up, shifts her entire head and full attention into the air.  Well she's a bit of a nutcase sometimes so nothing weird there.  Literally, my mind went straight to, she's looking at whatever I just noticed reflect off my mirror..whatever it is...I'M going to pretend she's seeing things. But then I see this glow out of my close peripheral vision come into view from under my trucks roof. Now I got a clear line of site but my comedian ass is still joking with her so I'm not looking at this thing directly yet.  But during this whole bit, I'm thinking OK, even through peripheral vision I'm understanding thi! s is something I haven't seen before.  Finally I  look as it's fading off...what I would assume is 50 miles away. My wife stared directly at it from start to end. Finally I quit joking with her and said, ok, real talk though, you seen that too??    That was weird right? I imagine this detail might be significant to other obnoxious husbands...for me to abandon a dumb bit I'm playing to annoy my wife....I can only imagine it WOULD take a ufo. I've been out doing ranch work since the sun came up, same thing yesterday, and so on. My only entertainment is toying with the mental state of my wife...and I go all in. But heh, sure enough, look at that. Now, from the instant I noticed a glow reflecting on my mirror to seeing this disappear...maybe only 5-6 seconds passed. Visually I would describe by asking you to imagine a high power spotlight shining up into a clean layer of fog setting at 1000ft. Or roughly where you would see low level clouds. The glow of the light hitting the fog would create an aura in that spot in the fog. Almost as if it was a glowing segment in the fog if you ignored the spotlights existence. Tonight though, in NE Oklahoma, specifics specifically at 2020 time. 8:20pm There is still no cloud cover at all, much less fog. Rationally I can't explain how this, without some form of translucent matter surrounding it, would glow since there's nothing in its vicinity to reflect a light. And there is no physical object that i can see, just a high speed glow. So..Clear skies, highspeed glow travelling at a speed I WOULD closely compare to meteorites when you see them fly from one horizon to the other in seconds. Being a (just gonna call it glow blob but use discretion as that is slight humor the rest is simply strange enough to find myself reporting it, to a site I had to look up google, how would I go bout reporting a ufo? lol) Ufos and aliens are topics that are unfortunately ridiculous now. Its IS truly unfortunate and most of society would hate what I attribute the majority of that fault to. My point though is any story requires credibility now for it to even be entertained. Take this for what it's worth. I'm US Army Vet. From 82nd Airborne 2nd brigade 2nd battalion. 2Fury.  Jumped and sometimes just fell from a LOT of C130s and C17's traveling faster than you ever would believe people are ok with jumping out at. Jumped day, night, hollywood(no ruck), and full combat loads. Took part in Operation Jade Helm and Operation Trident Juncture and couple others. I began in an 18x contract going straight into Special Forces. Completed all preliminary courses and finally after months of the most difficult and gruelling punishment the US government could legally bestow upon us..I had a major fracture in my right ankle during Selection phase of the course. I mean, my foot turned black, blue, yadayada, but it also had a giant green streak from my shin to my little toe. I don't know..but it was bad. 1st of many injuries. Spent the rest of my career in the earlier stated unit! . Listen, I know drones and everything else. All that crazy stuff most of y'all go nuts over, they are constantly training and running drills over Ft. Bragg with. At any moment you can search and find a drone. Which reminds me, this ufo made no sound whatsoever. No afterburner or late detect due to range, nothin. I cant evaluate size or elevation since a glow blob provides zero reference but it was surely at least above 800ft. Likely much higher but I'm only confident giving the low range limit. Lastly, for knowledge sake, I have theorized how aliens and ufos could exist that make logical sense to me. But this didn't even exist on THOSE extreme variables. Something else.   Flying from east To west btw.;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546
