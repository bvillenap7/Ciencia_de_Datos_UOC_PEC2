Made a high pitched whine as it passed overhead. At approximately 8:00 P.M. CST, I, my younger sister, and my dad were helping my grandmother to move into her new appartment by unloading the moving truck.  While we were out there, we heard a low rumbling sound which we took to be an air conditioner.  My sister went out of the moving van and said that there was something up in the sky.  We(my dad and I) came out to look and we saw and cigar-shaped object fly overhead.  It had come from the northeast and went southwest.  At the time it passed overhead, the rumbling we had heard changed into a high-pitched whine.  The object had 3 strobe lights on the bottom that blinked on and off one was red, one was white, and one was blue.  It flew rapidly to the southwest until it was out of sight. I'm not sure how big it was or at what altitude it was flying, but it looked to be very high up.;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546
Large shadow going across moon surface, no clouds clear sky.;2000-04-17 06:15:00;10secounds;Large shadow going across moon surface, no clouds clear sky. I was driving down the turnpike. I saw this dark line going accross the moon, there were no clouds, Just this long slinder shadow crossing the moon. It took about 10 secounds to pass. Would like to know if anyone else reported seeing it. ((NUFORC Note:  It is difficult for us, based on the relatively limited amount of information in the report, to distinguish what the witness describes from a typical contrail behind an aircraft, seen passing in front of the Moon.  We presume the witness considered this possibility, however.));36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546
Cigar shaped object emerged from the moon in broad daylight;2005-10-09 16:00:00;1:45 Minutes;Cigar shaped object emerged from the moon in broad daylight I was standing on my back patio at 4PM, looking at the moon in broad daylight when I noticed an object that appeared to be emerging from or behind the moon.   This cigar shaped object did not appear to get larger as it traveled westward across the sky and eventually dissapeared beyond the western horizon in a timespan of just over 1 minute and 45 seconds.  It had no color, and appeared translucent.   There was no sound, no vapor trail, and there were no apparent lights on or near the object.   I could not estimate the altitude of the object, as there were no aircraft in the area as it traveled across the sky.  It did not appear to be traveling lower or higher in altitude than a typical trans-continental commercial flight, but depending on the actual size of the object, its true altitude could not be determined.;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546
Large very bright bluish white strip of light seen on bottom of a large craft;2009-05-14 22:02:00;10 seconds max;Large very bright bluish white strip of light seen on bottom of a large craft While driving in to work (night shift in downtown Tulsa, Ok) at 10:02pm on Hwy. I-75 southbound (near 96th street exit) I saw a VERY BRIGHT strip of white or bluish white light in the sky to the east. This is very close to the approach used for runways at Tulsa International (Rwy. 18L and 18R). I am use to seeing planes approaching to land at the airport in Tulsa, but this WAS NOT an airplane about to land at the airport. It appeared (as best I can tell) to be about 1/4 mile to my east (no way to reference this distance, just a best guess). It had a dark outline I could not identify well, but then lit up with a VERY BRIGHT strip of white light on it's bottom. The light looked a bit like the expensive xenon headlights used by teenagers in the import cars, as it was almost blue tinted a bit. maybe like a mercury vapor light, but MUCH brighter. It stayed on for about 3/4 of a second and went out, then back on for about 1/4 second. Then, as it was going dark, it started moving away (appeared to be eastbound, but was hard to tell). As soon as the lights went out, I lost sight of it's dark outline and the sighting was over. If i were to guess, i would say this strip of light was at least 100 feet long, but I could see no real shape except that the strip of light was a straight line below a darker craft. When i saw it I immediately got a fight or flight feeling as adrenaline surged through me and I was awestruck and scared at the same time. I continued the drive to work (no missing time on my commute) and sent this report.;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546
