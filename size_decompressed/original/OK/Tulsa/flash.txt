Couldn;1999-09-13 23:10:00;1 second;Bluish-white flash lit up the sky for approx 1 second. Flash was low altitude, behind a hill near the airport with no explosion. Couldn't phone airport. I witnessed a bluish-white flash that lit up the western sky. The flash was over in 1 second but I never heard an explosion. I was in a field so I couldn't call the airport. I am a technical person with training in network computing, electronics, and aircraft mechanics. This was not an an aircraft or an electrical transformer exploding. The sky is very clear tonight.;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546
Shimmering bluish/green flash in the southeastern sky;2002-09-07 22:23:00;5-7 seconds;Shimmering bluish/green flash in the southeastern sky At approx. 10:23 p.m. on 9/7/02 there was a bright white flash of light.  Then a 'streak' of shimmering bluish/green light, reminiscient of fireworks, that was from my perspective the width of my thumb (1/2 inch).  The streak lasted approx. 2 seconds then 'pooled' into a yellowish/red light and winked out.  I was heading south and this appeared in the southeastern sky approximately 38 degrees up from the horizon.  I would say that the flash covered approx. 10-12 degrees of arc in the sky.;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546
