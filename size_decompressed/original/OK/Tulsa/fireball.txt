Large fireball traveling rapidly in a SW direction;2000-04-24 19:52:00;6 minutes +;Large fireball traveling rapidly in a SW direction The kids were the first to notice the object.  My wife and I ignored them at first, thinking they were seeing a contrail from a jet.  But taking a second look we began noticing unusual characteristics about the object that separated it from the hundreds of vapor trails we'd seen from aircraft.  First, the object appeared to be moving very rapidly compared to conventional aircraft.  Second, the head of the object was indeed a distinct fireball shape with no clear separation between the object itself and the vapor trail as you expect in a jet.  Third the jet is rarely perceived at all or - if it is the object is smaller than the vapor trail itself especially in width - that is one usually perceives the contrail but no jet.  Fourth, the contrail was not in a straight vector as it trailed from the object, but was more whispy and appeared carried by the winds or the atmosphere.  Fifth, the contrail varied in size - both in length and width - as the object traveled. In fact, soon afterwards we observed a jet contrail and noted the distinct differences between it and what we just saw. For a brief moment we saw another object like the first.  The parties and myself are in a disagreement over whether this was the original object we saw at a greater distance, another object, or a jet. My personal opinion is that the object was either a very large piece of space debris, a crashing aircraft, a huge meteor, or an extraterrestrial craft.;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546

At first glance it appeared to be fireworks but the fireball maintained an altitude of approximately 1000 ft and circled about a minute before breaking up into 2 separate balls that circled and eventually burned out. They were slightly larger than the helicopter that was circling them at a much wider radius. I didn't hear any reports of anything wierd on my mobile scanner. I know that I wasn't the only one who seen this because this is a heavily populated area and the helicopter was circling it. Maybe it was only fireworks but I have never seen fireworks that lasted that more than a few seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  We at first thought the witness might be describing the events that were observed at approximately 1930 hrs.over Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas.  However, the witness appears to be certain about the date.  We will attempt to confirm.  PD));36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546
Fireball sighting early morning 10/13/00;2000-10-13 06:45:00;maybe 1 min.;Fireball sighting early morning 10/13/00 This was told to me by a coworker.  She shared it with me on Friday the 13th, but was too scared to report herself.  She was sitting on a fifth floor balcony at work at 6:45 am smoking a cigarette when she saw an orange fireball in the western sky.  no estimation of distance.  The fireball lit up, was stationary at the time...not moving, was huge, then disappeared but left a vapor trail like an airplane for a small distance, then fireball appeared again, stationary.  This happened three times...fireball, trail, fireball, trail, fireball, trail, fireball was heading south.  Then disappeared completely.  She was shaken by the incident.  Was not an airplane or helicopter.  I questioned her at length.  She was very sure of what she saw and she is a very credible witness.  We are aware of the fireball sightings of later that night, but thought it important to include this early sighting for the record. ((NUFORC Note:  The author of the report is correct.  There were many sightings later that evening, many reported to the FAA by airline pilots.  PD));36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546
Mother's Day Night Fireball!;2008-05-11 23:00:00;1-2 sec;Mother's Day Night Fireball! May 11, 2008 11PM Tulsa, OK   At appr. 11pm, Central, I was in my bedroom looking out the window to the north. I saw a fireball with a short tail streak from the upper right to the lower left part of my field of view...towards the horizon. I would guess that it was moving to the northwest from a great distance away but I can't be sure. This thing was BRIGHT and made a swooshing sound.........like something out of a movie. As quickly as it burned out, it still lit up the yard and the bedroom like daylight. It appeared white with a slight yellow tinge to it.  It did not change directions from what I could tell so I am sure it was just space junk or a slow meteor. I am most curious to know if anyone else saw it because I can't find anything online to corroborate what I saw. I have searched for Tulsa fireball, UFO, space debris, etc. Nothing.;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546
UFO sighting in the eastern night sky over very populated area.;2009-07-12 04:00:00;30;UFO sighting in the eastern night sky over very populated area. A few nights ago I was in my front lawn around between 2am and 4am smoking. I was gazing into the sky and saw what looked like a very bright star. I knew it could not be a star because it was so close and the color of the sun. I went online to see if there were suppose to be any visible planets that night, which it said there was so I figured it was a planet. Last night July 12 2009 at 4am I was outside again and saw the same star object in the same place so I assumed again it was a planet in the eastern sky. What caught my attention this time as I was gazing at the planet/star it was moving. I was startled and confused to what I was seeing. It was the same object as I saw before a few weeks ago round bright orange and kind and a lower point to it but not exactly sure, but this time i saw it kind of swaying back and forth. This time I knew what I was seeing was not a planet or star and was not a helicopter because it was way to big to be one. My step dad was here asleep and I decided to wake him thinking maybe he should take a look at this. I woke him and had him follow me outside to show him what I was seeing and it was gone! I told myself planets do not disappear in five minutes and they do not sway back and forth. The night was a clear night, no sign of clouds and this sighting was over a highly populated city. Now that I have seen this object twice I am going to set up a video camera and hopefully will get the chance to get this object on camera.;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546

It had a tail and a semi hollow center. it rose into about mid sky and flew or floated straight north.  It had a heat that you could almost feel. And you could tell it was radiant heat because it was on fire, but not burning.;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546

I watched it for about a minute and a half, and it never changed shape or blinked.  I lost sight of it as it seemed to fly lower and lower and disappeared into the treetops.;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546
