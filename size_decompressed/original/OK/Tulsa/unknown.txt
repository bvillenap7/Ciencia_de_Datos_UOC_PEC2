((HOAX???))  Wedding Cake Ship Sound was heard.;1974-06-08 05:00:00;25 minutes;Wedding Cake Ship Sound was heard 51st and Memorial Drive, South West corner behind what would someday be Skaggs/Albertsons but at the time was an open undeveloped field boarding my neighborhood.   It was very early in the morning, approximately 5AM.  I was awakened by a female presence from my bedroom and I had this desire to get my bicycle out of my parents garage and go riding. The sun wouldn't be up for another hour.   It was the summer.  It was in the 70's, within a month or two of the June 8th, 1974 Tornadoes which destroyed Tulsa, Oklahoma, my home town.  I was outside riding my bicycle in my neighborhood, just 300 yards from my house.  The sun was just coming up.  There was this very unusual popcorn shrimp like cloud formations in the sky.   Just thousands of clouds which were white and puffy alto cumulus like clouds which were spaced out widely in the shape of curled up popcorn shrimp.   The local media weather personality on Channel 8, Don Woods, commented on how rare this day was because Tulsa had never had this kind of weather clouds before in it's recorded history.  I am to believe that this incident may have been just before June 8th, before the T.V. stations were knocked down by the tornadoes.  I have searched and searched for the exact name of these clouds and their exact date and history has buried it.  I can't find it.  Anyway, I'm riding my bike on dark streets back and forth, back and forth, until the sun rises for one hour when I see these clouds.   Their startling clouds.  I can barely find information on the June 8th 1974 triple twister storm which almost took my life and my family's life and left us in ruin for the balance of the year of 1974.  It was truly an awful time with not running water, no gas, no electricity, no phone and no T.V.   All we had was KRMG AM radio to inform the community for quite a while.   AM radios and batteries and lots of kerosene burning Coleman products to make light and cook our food.  As I rode my bike, the sun came over the horizon and you could see all these very strange shaped clouds.   And there were no cars running nor jet aircraft landing.  It was as if Tulsa was frozen. No noise outside at all, not even birds.  And I heard this one noise growing and growing as if it was coming from an aircraft or something up in the air and I began to point my eyes to the direction of this very unique, unearthly noise.  I would hear where it was coming from and move my eyes to the noise as it moved through the skies above me yet I saw nothing.  It flew right over me I would guess at the altitude of a landing jet aircraft and proceeded off to the east.   I kept peddling my bike eastward following the sound and looking up and continued to see nothing as the sound faded away.  This whole encounter did not take just 3 minutes, it was like 25 minutes. It moved as slowly as a Goodyear blimp from the sound as the sound moved in the skies as my ears could track that sound yet I saw nothing and it didn't wake anybody up in the neighborhood. When the sound finally disappeared in the east, I was standing on the ground straddling my bike. Not 5 minutes passed and the entire neighborhood woke up and came to life.   People went out to get their paper, started mowing lawns, dogs started barking, tire sounds of cars were heard on Memorial drive, all the noise of life returned as if somebody just threw a switch.  It was really weird as a 13 year old I actually recognized this and knew major things were wrong here.....  And for some reason, I forgot about this sound.  I just shelved it in my mind and never ever thought about it again.  I never spoke with anybody about it.  Never made it a bid deal.   I also had at the time dreams of being a bird and being able to fly in my own back yard.  I used to dream somebody taught me to flap my wings and I would actually fly around up to 1000 feet high.   And this female person would talk to me then and was like my foster mother if you will. I was encouraged to fly and remember topping the chimney on my parents house and actually flying just above the cloud cover of the town and hovering there for hours at night.  It was always at night. It was a female but I never could remember her face.   But she took a liking to me as a child. And then I never heard anything more from her again.   This whole thing probably spanned just 4 months as I remember.   But I shelved the entire thing and never told anybody.  I also remembered looking into the neighborhood houses for open windows of known Rock and Roll stereo freaks who might have a stereo playing but all windows were shut that I could see and besides, the sound was from above me and slightly to the south heading west to east in direction as it moved.  It also wasn't the kind of sound which was played back from a recording with hiss or scratch sounds like a record does, it was the REAL THING SOUND.  It had the decibels of a powerful engine or something like that.   There was no stereo which could make a noise that loud which was obviously far up in the air somewhere up there.  It also gave me the feeling that somebody was looking down on me, the one kid outside with the bicycle chasing this sound and not being able to catch it and I felt this terrible, awful sorrow coming from somewhere as if a family member was either just abandoned or died or perhaps the feeling you get when your best pet dog is killed in a violent way.  A very sorrowful, sad feeling which actually made tears come to my eyes finally as the sound finally went away to the east and was never heard from again.  I had the feeling that I was just abandoned like a mom would say goodbye to here child for the last time never to see him ever again.   There was a sense of concern and fear and I remembered now, at the time I was led to believe I was going to have a very hard and challenging life.  I was 13 years of age at this time.  Lost in space had been on T.V. and the sound of that spaceship in that T.V. series was Erie but not similar to this sound.   This sound was not man made it was real.  And so I grew up, and time just buried all of this.  I never heard this sound again and forgot about all this until recently.  I'm 46 years old now.  I'm driving across country and the AM radio is on.   Coast to Coast AM is playing and George Noory.  He's interviewing Michael Horn.   Michael Horn is supposed to be the U.S. press representative of Billy Meier from Switzerland.  And I listened to this interview they did and somewhere in the middle of it they played the wedding cake ship sound.  I said to myself as soon as 10 seconds of this sound was played that I've heard this before somewhere??? And I began to ask myself which T.V. show or Movie did I hear this sound on before so I could know where these guy's ripped this sound off from.  I eventually went to the website and downloaded this sound and played it a few times and it all started coming back to me.  I was asking same question back in 1974.  I remembered that morning.  I remembered the weird bicycle ride I took that summer morning.  Asking the question is this sound was coming from a neighbors house, what T.V. show or movie  did they get it from.  Yet I knew it wasn't coming from a neighbors house or some passing car's 8 track.   This is 1974 you see, not even the cassette tape was popular then.  Microwave ovens and cable T.V. were years off.  Color T.V. was just getting popular.  FM stereo existed but not widely used in cars yet.  Cars still typically had noisy AM radio with 8 track players bolted on.    We didn't even have synthesizers in that era to manufacture a noise like this.  But I heard this damn noise.  I felt those feelings.  I had those dreams in my sleep of flying with my other mom.  I felt some love from this person.  And I have some post comments to make to this female person, whoever it was. After having done some years research on Billy Meier and the Pleiadians and finding out that these people frequent all of our media and are somewhat experts on Human current events. If what I have read and felt are indeed true, then I'm dealing with an emotional being who's not learned to separate herself from her science projects....    And I'm sorry you never had a child. And while it's sad that you people actually read the contact reports from this very website, maybe you'll read this one and remember what you did back in 74.  I know it was you and I shake my head and ask the question if you leave that much concern in a 13 year old childs mind how are your possibly going to help mankind?  It was the certain knowledge and admission that this sound was the Wedding Cake Ship. That the Wedding Cake ship was commissioned at around this time.  And I'm left with the question, why Tulsa, Oklahoma?  Was it the knowledge we were about to be greased by a large group of Tornadoes?   Was there something special about me? All I'm personally left with is she decided to adopt me as her son for a few months and perhaps study me, I guess...  I dunno....  But I did hear that Wedding Cake ship sound on that popcorn shrimp cloud day which we have never had again, ever.... ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

There appeared to be only one object.  I work evenings in the office of a trucking company.  One of my co-workers went outside to smoke a cigarette and saw what she originally thought was a plane coming in.  As she watched it she noticed that it did not appear to be moving.  Then it suddenly shot straight up.  When she came in we were all skeptical so we went out with her to see what she was talking about.  After watching it for a while we all agreed that it could not be a normal aircraft as we know them.  We got out some binoculars and studied the object thru them.  It appeared like a prism with somewhat of a diamond shape but all you could see were the twinkling colors that changed like a kalidescope of purple, yellow, orange, green, red and blue ((NUFORC Note:  We have no explanation for the sudden movement of the object reported, but the kaleidascope of colors is consistent with a twinkling star.));36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546

Large silver object hovering in N Horizon with 2 white lights side by side. Took off in steep climb;2001-09-13 17:45:00;4 minutes;Large silver object hovering in N Horizon with 2 white lights side by side. Took off in steep climb I walked out of my office near Tulsa Intl. Airport (I am S/W of the airport—maybe 3 miles away to S & 1 mile W of airport). I immediately noticed a really bright & large silver object with two really bright spotlight looking white circle lights side by side, it was hovering in the lower horizon straight N. It looked like it had an erie glow all around it, it was huge. I watched it for 2 mins. It just hovered in same spot. I kept turning around looking for coworkers to come out & everytime I looked at it—it had not moved. Then finally a coworker came out & he finally saw it & not long after that it took off almost streight up to a very steep climb to the West & was gone really quick. (It was a really high climb & a steep angle climb for a usual airplane to make). It also left a contrail at about a 60° angle. Living & working close to the airport I am used to seeing airplanes at all altitudes & all kinds. That WAS NO AIRPLANE. With all the maddness going on, could have been military servelance of some kind that I've never seen. Don't know. My boss also saw a strange happening about 2 hours later off hwy. 75 (which is a lot of miles to the West of where I saw this thing) he was going north about 8:00. It was dark & he said he noticed something in sky really bright with lights similar to an airplane but knew it was no airplane & kept watching it—it also seemed to hover & flying erraticaly Going N then S then suddenly making really strange turns that a normal  airplane could not make. He pulled off road & got out of car looking at it & it took off really quick. (I would guess he saw same thing only 2 hours later in the dark);36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546

strange noises in the night time sky of tulsa.  ((NUFORC Note: Please see note.  Sound probably related to aircraft activity.  PD));2004-12-22 23:00:00;3-5 minutes;strange noises in the night time sky of tulsa. i live in an area which is known as midtown which is close to the tulsa state fairgrounds, my wife and i have both lived in our house for five years now. we have both heard very unusual, very loud, jet engines late in the evening and early in the morning, granted we are close to tulsa international airport, however these are not exactly what i would describe as standard military or even commercial airline sounds. it starts as a low, deeply intense rumble, like an approaching thunderstorm, but then it gets strange, it sounds like someone rollerskating across a wooden floor, it takes the noise and the vibration several minutes to stop, my wife and i have both went outside and looked north, south, east, and west, but the noise is not centrally located to one direction. usually when this occurs there are military jets that show up within a few minutes, there is a air national guard base not far from the tulsa international airport. the military jets go into a holding pattern at about 20,000 feet and do laps around the city as if they were looking for something or chasing something. whatever this object is, it is not a helicopter, a commercial airliner, or even a standard military jet doing night maneuvers, i know there are black op military programs, but i think it is unusual in the sense that these types of crafts are usually not tested in high population density areas, or maybe they are. at any rate, i have never seen the craft, or crafts, but if i do, or can manage to get a recording of the craft or the sound it makes i will do a follow up posting. any info or input would be greatly appreciated.

As one of the final tests, they back the jets up to a wall and run the turbines at the specified rpm for several minutes.  I used to live northwest of the reporters location closer to downtown, and could still hear it.  The neighbor who clued me in to this was an employee of AA.  It's amazing how many miles that sound travels when the conditions are right.  What you hear are the low frequency waves, kind of like listening to the bass rumbling from the car in the next lane.   Another mystery solved, several more to go. ((END ADDENDUM));36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546

The lights then turned to red and blue on the side and it all of a sudden took off and was gone of sight in probly 15 seconds, the shape was unlike anything i had seen before.  Then last night technically this mornign may 15 at 12:30 am i was driving home from a friends house and spotted it in the exact same spot,  i called the friends i had been with last time told them it was back and to get a camera i picked up my first friend then got to the house with the camera, at the exact moment the object was flying over my friends house literaly 200 yards above us, we tried to pull out the camera but it was going to fast we halled through the neighboorhood and got some ok shots of it flying away.  Any way thats 2 times in 3 nights we have seen it and now have a little footage of it, it is the strangest thing i have ever seen, it is kind of a circular shape proble 3 or 4 times the size of a car not very big at all.  We are going to look for it again tonight and i will be back to post if anything else happens.;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546

3 Round Bright Green Lights not flashing side by side & 1 Red Flashing Light, Loud Craft.;2015-01-14 02:00:00;3 minutes;3 Round Bright Green Lights not flashing side by side & 1 Red Flashing Light, Loud Craft. Looked out patio door at 2 a.m. In the North Airport area I noticed some really bright green lights side by side in sky.  Thought it was odd and not normal.  So I sat there and waited for it to get closer.  It was low flying, barely above tree top level.  It came about as fast as an airplane taking off would.  When it got close I could see 3 really large Round Bright Green Lights that were not blinking.  It was going South.   When it got to my fence line it stopped and hovered. It was real loud like a lawnmower in the sky. It was so steady hovering there.  I sat there wondering what the heck this thing is? I could not open my door to get a better look, or my Alarm would have went off.  I sat there watching it.  I heard a noise like a transmission would make and those 3 Green Lights rotated counter clockwise and was now Facing East instead of South like they were facing. That was an incredible sight.  The lights literally twirled around fast.  When it turned I now saw a R! ed Flashing Light on the back of this thing and could see about one inch of the Green light lens on one of the lights on the side near me, I knew the lights were still there but now they were facing East.  The craft took slowly off going East now.  This thing had to be black or a dark color cause It was so dark that morning, I could not make out shape of it.  I could not tell what it was. It was not our Police Helicopter or an airplane.  It was not a toy either.  It was too large.  The lights were huge. I live on the flight path of the airport and am used to seeing all kinds of airplanes and helicopters.  Never saw lights like that or a sound like that.  I have spent hours now researching every plane, drone and helicopter I can find and can’t find anything that has 3 Green lights on it that are that large and round and don’t blink.  So wish I knew what it was.   One thing for sure, I saw first hand how these flying crafts change direction so fast.  Apparently they must push a button or a gear and can go from going South to going East real quick.  It must be a new craft too, not many reports of 3 Green lights that are solid and not flashing.  I will never forget what I saw.  It all happened so fast and me being slow at walking, I could not get my camera to take a picture or I would have missed it!;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546

Large almost stationary distant object with white and blinking red lights;2017-01-21 05:00:00;1.5 hours;Large almost stationary distant object with white and blinking red lights Noticed an extraordinarily bright star NE of my location after several seconds of watching it, the star appeared to be blinking.  Figured it was a distant airplane. Some minutes later, I looked again, the object appeared stationary.  After several more minutes, same thing.  The blinking was intriguing, so I grabbed my binoculars. I braced the binoculars against a door to get a steady focus.  The object appeared to be a string of horizontal lights, with red lights blinking somewhere along the middle and another on the left end.  Figured it was a very distant jet, and the sighting was occluded by atmospheric conditions. Over the space of about 45 minutes, the apparent direction of travel was to the east and it may have been moving with the earth's rotation.  Thinking it was a planet (unlikely, as it was well to the north), I double checked with in-the-sky.org.  All of the planets were eliminated as an explanation. After a total of about 90 minutes, I went back to look again and the object had moved well north and slightly west of its previous position.  Another look through the binoculars provided pretty much the same description, with the possible exception of a gap in the lights. As I type this, it is moving below the tree line out sight in the general direction of Wichita, Kansas.;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546

Then it transformed into a huge white light in the shape of a bowl.  I could see a darker outline above the light creating a full round circle shape.  I said what is that?   As I was looking at it the light began to diminish until nothing was left visibly.  Although the light was totally gone I could still see a dark round outline in the sky.
