Cylinder over Tulsa 2 years ago.;2003-03-12 14:00:00;10 seconds;Cylinder over Tulsa 2 years ago. I remember the day which was a Sunday before tax day. I just got done doing my taxes and was heading down the road to the gym.  I walked out to my car and went to the trunk. While closing the trunk and facing the east, with a very clear ski and the sun more closely to my back, I caught a glimps of a reflection to the east over the house.  At first, what I didn't think anything was unusal but at the same time it was out of position.  The meaning here is my home is in the landing and takeout path for Tulsa Int. Airport.  In forty years, I have seen nearly every kind of airplane there is.  Plus my dad work on all kinds of airplanes for 30 years included the Boeing 747.  What caught my eye at first was the thing in the sky was a half mile east of the line up point for the runway. It was also way to high. I would say, 5,000 feet maybe more. My first thougth was, this plane was going to have to take a crash dive to the left in order to land.  Also what seem odd was it was going slightly slower than normal landing speeds.  There were also no landing lights of any kind.  Then I realized something was wrong...  This thing didn't have a set of wings, tail, rudders, engines. If it was going to land, the landing gears would have been down by then. There were none of them either...   Then I just stared in amazement... This thing did not have any identifing marks that a normal airplane had. With no tail, no brand name.  It had no windows. The very front was black as well as the very end of it.  There was a black type of band in the middle. The remainder was polished type aluminum.  It was a cylinder in shape. For size, it was, I would say, longer than a 747 fusalog... maybe 30 feet or more. In other words, it was long.  Then I started to think for a second... the wind, very slight, was coming from the south maybe 2 to 3mph.  Not a big deal but planes that would be taking off would be going from north to south.  With this monster a half mile to the east at 5,000 feet, it would have been right in the path of any planes taking off and heading east.  This thing continued on a stright north direction.  Did not turn or change speeds.  I could definitly see after a 10 second look that it had no wings or familiar airplane features.  I didn't hear a sound. Even a 747 at a half mile distance is something I would have heard and I have a hearing problem. After staring at it so long, it was almost memorizing to look at.  Then I lost track of it because of the distance it traveled.  If you contact me do so by email is best.;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546
There were two objects, red and white, cylindrical in shape, extremely high up moving at incredible speed.;2004-07-26 20:00:00;5 minutes;There were two objects, red and white, cylindrical in shape, extremely high up moving at incredible speed. My friend and I were about to start our run, when I looked up casually while I was talking to him and to the right of the moon there were two crafts, one was white, and the other was red. They were extremely high up, so much that I knew they could not be a US craft. The speed that they were going must have been very fast for the height they were at. At first, they were very close to each other, but then moved in different directions. My friend and I could tell that they were cylindrical in shape. We watched them for about five minutes before they were too far away to see. There wass absolutely zero possibility that they were airplanes, because they were so high up, almost to the point of being in orbit.;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546

All of sudden when driving north I spotted something in the sky.  The sighting was right over the crossing of pole cat creek. up in the sky was a craft with three wings and three sets of wings. The wings were almost like a capital L with another hook on it.   The aircraft was just hovering about 200 feet up.  It was a cylinder type of craft with a sharp front.  The wings of the set of three were aprox 1/3 of the length of the craft.  The wings were almost like frozen.  There was no activity other then the hovering.   At the end was almost like a jet engine but a lot bigger and move developed.  There was also nothing else coming out of this engine no streaks. almost like when you see fumes coming out of an exhaust.  More layers then a regular engine.  The color was almost like a black silk kind of color.  It was somewhat shiny, but still dull.   By the time i got off the exit it was already gone.   There is a lot of plane activity which that is what i thought at first but it was running east to west, instead of running north to south, which the Jenks Airport does.  It was also moving to slow and to low to the ground to be a aircraft.   I'm really not doing this for attention.  I just want to know if anyone else saw what I did, last night.;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546
