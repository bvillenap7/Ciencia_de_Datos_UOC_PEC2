trio of craft;1998-04-28 22:00:00;1 minute;trio of craft What I saw when I was out delivering pizzas was 3 craft fly overhead and come to a dead stop and hover there.  After a few seconds they did a right angle turn and sped off.  From my perspective they were out of sight in less than a second.  While they were hovering there, I felt sheer terror and have never told anyone about this because I did not want to be thought a crackpot. I have been in the military and have seen many types of military aircraft, even at night and have never seen anything like that.  I am a trained observer (ex-drill sergeant) and that was unlike anything I ever saw before.  Now that I am crippled from a work injury and live alone, I have nothing to fear by reporting this.

I saw a light traveling directly overhead,silently at 3000 ft.;2000-05-23 20:15:00;2.5 minutes;I saw a light traveling directly overhead,silently at 3000 ft. First of all, I must say that i am a little confused about the exact date because I have waited approximately one year from date of incident.  I did not know who to report this to until I found this website and thought it important to report it even at this late date.  What I am not confused about, or my two sons, is what we saw.  We saw one night just before dark between the dates May 19 and May 27 2000, approximately May 23 a very strange circular light traveling in the sky at approximately 3000 ft. altitude, from east northeast to west southwest.  This light appeared diffused, but was obviously at a low level altitude.  The light was mostly white to pink in color and very odd.  Having been raised one mile from an airport and an Air National Gaurd airbase, as well as a father with 40 years aircraft mechanic experience and myself as a aircraft mechanic in the airforce, I have seen most every imaginable aircraft known to man.  This craft, or light, was obviously a UFO.  The sky in the backdrop was near dusk and virtualy cloudless.  The flight path that this was on carried it directly overhead.  As it approached I noticed there was no sound whatsoever.  Being alarmed by this I sent my youngest boy running in the house to retrieve a disposable camera that unfortunatly was in my vehicle at my wifes work.  As my child went to retrieve camera my other son and I continued to keep our eyes trained on said craft.  It continued its path diligently without variance.  I followed it with my eyes as far as I could until it dissapeared.  When it dissapeared I immediately went to the middle of the street looking up and down searching for someone else who seen this.  Unfortunately, there was no one.  I will conclude by saying this:  This was a UFO.  Not only to me, but to anyone who would have saw it on this earth.  Also, having lived in this town for 38 years I have learned the flight paths of aircraft in this area.  In my three years living at this house I have never seen an airplane, helicopter, durigable, or any o! ther cra ft fly in this direction.  Especially at that altitude.  For the last year I have dilligently watched the sky looking for a craft flying this direction.  To no avail.  But I gotta tell ya, the no noise thing to this day gives me goosebumps.  Please don't think were crazy, we are really very normal people and have been very hesitant in discusing this with anyone.  Please feel free to contact me anytime and I will discuss this in greater detail if needed.  Thank you. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546
Two Balls of Light sighted in Tulsa, Ok.;2000-06-06 08:15:00;about 5 minutes;Two Balls of Light sighted in Tulsa, Ok. At sunset around 8:15 pm. Two sightings seen from backyard patio. First sighting was witnessed just by me, I first saw a weird colored light in the sky, as if a child would draw a solid line across the sky, from where I stood it was about three inches long. It stood out from the rest of the sky, there were no clouds near it. I have never seen such a thing and this is why I took notice, I have seen other balls of light but not like this one. I also have had UFO sightings, again, not  like this one. The streak if that is what you want to call it was solid, and a flourescent pink/orange all by itself in the sky, nothing else in the sky looked as bright as this nor had its coloring. It was moving from right to left, what clouds could be seen in the distance were moving in the opposite direction. I first saw the streak appear out of no where, I also noticed a very bright ball extending from this streak on the beginning of the right side of the streak. Needless to say I was hypnotized by this event. Just as it was going to disappear, I called out to my friend who was in the house to come and see. She saw it too and I thought that this was the end of it. Then all of a sudden another streak appeared looking exaxtly like the first one. I said to my friend to get the camera and she did. We took the pictures right before this second sighting disappeared too. I was hopeing that we caught it on film. Got back the pictures the other day, and low and behold there it was. But its funny because you cannot see the streak, only the bright round ball. I have two sets of these pictures and would like to get them to you, I do not have a scanner, and so I think that I would have to send them to you through snail mail. Please let me know if you are interested, and thank you for your time and consideration. Sincerely, ((name deleted));36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546
Six witnesses saw several round objects flashing and flying in alternate  flight patterns over Oklahoma interstate on November 11th.;2000-11-11 14:00:00;2-3 min;Six witnesses saw several round objects flashing and flying in alternate  flight patterns over Oklahoma interstate on November 11th. Driving east between Oklahoma City and Tulsa some time during the early afternoon on November 11, 2000.  The weather was sort of strange that day with lots of thick, low-lying clouds and light rain contrasted against an occasional burst of very bright afternoon sun making it through the clouds.  I saw a perfect rainbow in the sky and was so impressed with its clarity (a perfect arc with all colors visible from end to end) that I decided to pull over at the next rest stop and take a few pictures.  Stopped at a picnic area and waved hello to a hispanic family sitting at a picnic table before snapping a few shots.  Had just turned my camera from auto to off when i noticed a line of what i thought had to have been geese or a larger sort of bird because they were flying in a v-formation and alternating black and white, which i thought meant that their wings were black on one side and white on the other.  the longer i looked i realized that they were flying too high to be geese and too low to be an airplane.  As they got closer I began to notice that they were breaking off in to separate groups and then coming back together in a perfect line or v-shape, then they would do it again.  By the time they were directly overhead I was so overwhelmed that i didn't notice that my camera was turned off and wasn't clicking.  the hispanic family and i were all shouting back and forth and pointing up at the sky but we couldn't understand each other because of the language barrier.  By this time it was unquestionable that what was passing over us was a group of between 7 and 9 objects that were moving silently and independently as they flashed brightly in a pulsating way, chaning from black to bright white.  i finally figured out that my camera was turnede off and got a shot of them as they moved off towards the southwest.  the photo that i got back shows these lights grouped together in a weird pattern but it's really small. As far as my background, I'm in horticultural sales and my company ships plants to many of the major chain-stores. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates two dates.

Three objects traveling North to South over Tulsa/Jenks, OK;2008-05-03 23:00:00;15 Seconds;Three objects traveling North to South over Tulsa/Jenks, OK Me and my wife stepped outside at about 23:00 CST last night and saw three objects flying North to South over South Tulsa/Jenks, Oklahoma.  Two smaller objects led a slightly larger object.  The speed of the front two, seemed to stay consistent, while the trailing one matched the speed of the front two for about half of the time that we viewed.  After that, it slowed while the others continued on. The trailing object seemed to stop, just as it was going to fly out of our view which would have been blocked by a tree and buildings.  I ran through the house to get to a better vantage point, but by that time all three objects were gone. The speed - honestly appeared to be about the speed I have seen satellites cross the sky, however I do not believe these were satellites - I have never seen three fly together...nor had ever seen one stop.  The larger trailing object, was much bigger than a satellite through the naked eye --  and actually appeared to be round.  The front two, though smaller, appeared to be round also. They made no sound at all.;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546

We were heading North on Rockford ave and to my left coming out of the west was a orange light going west to east.  I noticed it because I did not see any blinking red or blue lights that a normal aircraft would have.  It was solid orange and I thought this was strange.   I preceded north to my street and turned left which I would be heading West.  I kept looking at the light and noticed several more were following the first one.   I stopped the car and me and my sons were watching these orange lights quietly moving West to to East at a slow pace with no sounds.  I would guest they were about a quarter mile away.   When we stopped the car to get out and watch we were actually about 100 yards from my house.  My son said hurry dad lets get the video camera, so we rushed home and he grabbed it and started to film which we caught the last 2 lights on video.   My daughter was home and she rushed out to see the last 2.  These lights seemed to have just disappeared.   My son swears one shot off fast but I did not see it shot off that fast.  We had to deal with some trees in our way.   I have been told these were Chinese laterns and I honestly do not see the way they moved it could of been.;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546

Saw a glowing orange light traveling at constant speed and altitude no nav lights no sound.;2012-06-01 20:00:00;20 seconds;saw a glowing orange light traveling at constant speed and altitude no nav lights no sound Heard you guys describe something I saw a couple month ago on coast to coast tonight.  I was standing with my mother talking outside by my car before I left their house and my mother said what do you think that is.  I looked up and saw a glowing orange circle traveling at a constant speed and making absolutely no sound whatsoever.  Now just so you know I am an aircraft mechanic and I work at Tulsa International Airport so I'm used to seeing planes in the air.  This object had no navigational lights and was flying at approximatly 2000 ft and was close enough to us that if it was an airplane we would have heard it,  my parents live pretty much right under where the planes line up to land at Tulsa International when there is a prevailing south wind I checked at work the next day and the planes had been coming in from the north the night before because of a prevailing nothern wind so no planes should have been in the area.  I have worked on planes for 10 yrs and! have never seen anything remotely like this.  The object continued to fly north at constant speed and altitude until it was out of sight.

I heard a strange sound that seemed to be a mix between very distant bells and a long drawn out low trumpet sound.  At some point I looked up into the sky at the snow fall and spotted a black circle.  It almost seemed as if it were turning slowly left then 30 seconds later to the right, as if a satellite dish would do when searching for transponders. Each time the sound would resonate into the night like a pulse.  There was what looked like a faint red light in the middle of the circle, that part was hard to tell, it could have been me trying to focus through the snow, but I for certain stared at this black circle that is no longer there, so it was not a shadowed fixture from a tower, something was there.  It was in the South Eastern sky just south of Tulsa University.;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546

We kept driving so we only observed them for about 5 minutes. About 1 1/2 hours earlier, just West of Inola on our way to the hospital, we noticed a bright circle of light northeast of Tulsa, and about the time my Grandson asked me what star it was it started moving South.

At approximately 8:00pm on December 7th, 2017, my husband and I witnessed 2 large objects and 2 smaller objects in the sky.  At first they started to blink, and the two larger objects continuously circled each other for around 30 minutes.  The two smaller objects disappeared after about 10 minutes, leaving the 2 larger objects chasing each other in the sky.  They would blink for a while, then be a solid golden color, then go back to blinking and so on.   At one point, they were stationary in the sky for 20 seconds or so, and a silver/blue object fell from one of the crafts, then started flying again.  After about 30 minutes had passed, the two large objects stopped circling in the sky and took off in one direction.   I tried taking a few photos with my phone and managed to capture an image.  It looked like a circle with a tail.;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546

They all looked see through and like large circles of clouds or white smoke as if they were possibly trying to cloak within the clouds. They literally appeared to be large cloud like circles moving different directions and quickly...we saw about 8 total over 30 minutes. I absolutely believe this to be a UFO and a very strange one at that. They almost looked more organic in nature than like a metal made machine. No lights were seen on or around th! em...they were more just translucent. Three people in my family also saw these and agree they were not only incredibly strange but not of this earth.  This occurred within the city of Tulsa Oklahoma.  I did see a older video post on the UK Mirror that looked very much like the craft saw. These in this post were seen during the day and looked like smoke circles as well. Considering they were more than one makes me think this could be a fleet traveling.No sounds were heard with these at all.;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546
