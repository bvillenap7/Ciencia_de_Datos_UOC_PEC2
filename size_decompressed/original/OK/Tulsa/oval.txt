August, 2nd 11:45 pm. I saw a oval -teardrop shaped UFO up close with binoculars,.ASTOUNDING! I am still perplexed.....;2008-08-02 11:45:00;10 seconds;August, 2nd 11:45 pm. I saw a oval -teardrop shaped UFO up close with binoculars,.ASTOUNDING! I am still perplexed..... Dear Mr.Davenport or staff, I am reporting this sighting again because I have a feeling you all don't believe me or think its a hoax.  Forgive me if it was a backlog issue.  I re edited my own report to shorten it up a bit.  I am in my middle ages and I pretty much know what belongs in the sky and what is not the norm.  I am also a ametuer astronomer.I ask you please to delete my report and all data pertaining to me if your not going to use this report.  I would testify under oath in a court of law that all I have said is true if I had too.I wished others had reported craft from Tulsa that night to back up my sighting. Thank you sincerely,  ((name deleted)). August 2 2008 East Tulsa Oklahoma  11:45 pm  While laying down studying stars and constellation's with binoculars,I noticed with my bare eyes to the east of me at about 80 degrees, 600 to 800 feet high, a craft traveling at high speed, flying from south to north before loosing site of it. My eyes were well adjusted to the dark since I was already studying the stars.The sighting lasted 10 seconds.Five with bare eyes and about five with binoculars. It was brownish red/amber in color and shape was oval- teardrop.It had some sort of membrane/aura around it.Amazingly I already had my binoculars in my hands,the timing was incredible!I zoomed in on it up close,it was squared off in the front like bay windows yet rounded as it tapered towards the back.The very back was rectangle in  shape, totally silent, stayed at constant speed, no lights at all.No way was it a balloon, it was a dead air night no wind whatsoever and the sky was clear.Left no smoke/con trail.When observed through binoculars the membrane was transparent,and oval in shape.I could see through the haze but the teardrop shaped craft was solid,defenantly mechanical in shape. It was traveling too fast on a horizontal heading to be a weird looking balloon.It was not a plane, as close as it was I would have heard the engines, This craft was silent.I would guess the size at 30x20x5'.I honestly can say now that I have seen something in the sky that I can not explain!It was not a satellite,plane,hang glider, balloon,jet,dirigible,shooting star,ISS or helicopter.I have seen many satellites and meteor's,we live in a City with a International Airport so I have seen all kinds of aircraft including military aircraft.It truly was a UFO by its very definition!
