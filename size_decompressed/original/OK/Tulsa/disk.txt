Silver disk in the afternoon Tulsa Ok.;1985-06-07 16:30:00;5 minutes;Silver disk in the afternoon Tulsa Ok. I was a passenger in the back seat of a 1985 Dodge caravan (prety big windows).  We were southbound on an interstate highway entering the outskirts of Tulsa.  I do not recall the exact date or time, but I know it was mid summer of the year I turned 15 (in april).  There was some kind of municipal airport we were approaching through the valley (into it?).  That day there were an unusually high number of private aircraft flying that day (most of them were unpowered light and ultralightprivate aircraft).  I remember watching the gliders soar in thermal updrafts for a long time as we got closer(20 min. at least).  There was one glider in particular caught my eye.  Not because it was vissually extra ordinary, but because it appeared to have no angualr momentum.  I observed the craft for about 4 min. marveling at the skill of that pilot to keep riding the same current for such a long time.  Those arent glider wings!  Suddenly the craft I had just been watching for a realllllllly long time looked like a silver disk.  It was late afternoon, because the sunlight reflected brightly in a radial patern from each side of the center of the disk.  From a great distance these reflections looked like a long wingspan white glider (the kind that get towed up by powered aircraft).  The moment I realized what i saw, I told my Dad to try to pull over.  we could not because by this time the landscape had become decidedly urban (I had not been watching the road for quite a long trip).  I watched it for as long as I could wishing the video camera was assembled (2 piece camera/vcr system) so that i cluld be taping this un-beleivable event.  My view was obstructed finally by an overpassing highway onramp.  When the obstruction cleared, the craft was gone.  I remember there being a refinery or some other heavy industry site that appeared to be the same distance from me as the craft, but on a Southerly vector. The craft: Silver disk with a bulge in the middle. it was about a hands width at arms length North of the refinery. The altitude is hard to guess, but it was about as high as 2.5 the height of the refinery. It was tilted on axis both toward me and 45 degrees to the side. (i could see the entire top except the part obscured by the dome in the middle. It appeared to be hovering...or moving verrrrry slow. No sound apperent (caravans windows do not roll down in the back though), ((NUFORC Note:  We feel compelled to comment that it is not unusual for a glider to remain virtually motionless in the sky, particularly if it is flying in ridge lift or an atmospheric wave.  Glider pilots dream of such situations.  However, we have no explanation for why the object would change its appearance.

Disk shaped UFO shoots out of pink cloud in Tulsa, Oklahoma.;2001-09-15 15:30:00;5 seconds;Disk shaped UFO shoots out of pink cloud in Tulsa, Oklahoma. I was on the front lawn, facing southwest, and noticed a strange looking cloud in the sky, just above the top of the houses across the street, so it wasn't directly overhead.   It was pink and golden colored, unlike the white clouds in the rest of the sky.   Suddenly a large disk shaped object came out of the cloud.  It was silver looking, then went VERY bright, like a golden neon light.  It hovered there for a few seconds, then shot off horizontally to the west, too fast for me to even follow with my eyes.   I've never seen a UFO before so this was really exciting to see!;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546
A disc, not very high up and moving very fast from north to south.;2004-05-19 05:30:00;5 sec;A disc, not very high up and moving very fast from north to south. I am an ex-army NCO, I was practicing with a sword on my back porch when suddenly a disc shaped craft transversed the horizon from north to south. It was a glowing white disc and not very high up,it moved so fast that I was barely able to make out that it was a disc.;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546
Three stationary multi-colored lights in triangle formation over Tulsa, Ok;2012-08-28 02:30:00;1-2 hours;Three stationary multi-colored lights in triangle formation over Tulsa, Ok This sighting occured at my home in Tulsa, Oklahoma between the hours of 2:00 and 3:30 a.m. I was looking west up at the sky and saw three blinking lights in the sky. The sky was pretty clear, No clouds and no regular air traffic. I observed these three stationary white lights that were spread Out like an isoceles triangle. One was very faint to the naked eye, but i could clearly see it was blinking,  Slowly at times and rapid at times. The second white light was closer and I could make out a red and a blue light on either side of the central blinking white light. The third light was the closest to me, roughly 2 or 3 miles. This light was also blinking what looked like morse code along with the other two lights. This spacecraft, or whatever it was, was definitely a saucer like shape. I could make out the white light that came out of the craft was in a horizontal line that ran around the ship. It also seamed to have multi- colored lights that spun around the craft or center of the white light. All three of these ships sit stationary for a couple hours, this happened three nights in a row.  The first two nights they were in the same place in the sky, the third night they had moved.  But all three nights they seemed to be in a perfect triangle formation.;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546
Tulsa OK 61st & Harvard residential area UFO 20 - 25 feet off the ground above the trees (front yard).;2013-09-24 14:00:00;5 minutes;Tulsa OK 61st & Harvard residential area UFO 20 - 25 feet off the ground above the trees (front yard) After picking up my kids from school I came home and pulled up to my drive way and discovered that my garage door did not want to open I stepped out of my car and walked around the car to let my kids out when I heard a noise that sounded like electricity /static electricity/low pitch I felt as something was off and had a strange urge to look up in the trees in my front yard.   When I looked up there was a craft/ saucer shaped the size of a medium round kitchen table just hanging there about 20 â€“ 25 feet off the ground just above the treetops.  The craft was very clear I could see every detail on it.  It had green, yellow and red lights rotating in one direction and the craft itself rotated in the opposite direction of the lights.    As I started panicking and telling my kids to get out of the car and go towards the house I kept my eye on the object and felt as I was been watched by whoever or whatever was inside the craft.  The craft than changed its position from facing straight down to angle view (front part of the saucer facing towards the ground and back facing to the sky) and then it just shot up in the sky and to the side as if I blinked and nothing was ever there.   My kids saw the craft from the car.  The metal of the craft was not ordinary it almost looked as it was see through some kind of liquid metal not of this earth.   Until this experience I was not a believer.  This was not something out of this world it almost looked as it moved with the speed of light..;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546
While F-16s took off from TUL, a white disc/cloud object accelerated and disappeared on horizon.;2016-02-09 14:30:00;4 seconds;While F-16s took off from TUL, a white disc/cloud object accelerated and disappeared on horizon. I am a aircraft ground handler at Tulsa International Airport (KTUL).  Between 14:27 and 14:33, I was servicing a plane parked on the B terminal, when I heard the local Air National Guard F-16s taking off.  I watched the lead aircraft rotate on Runway 36R heading North and then a small white disc- shaped cloud above the airport caught my eye.   The cloud began to accelerate to the east from a stationary position at a high rate of speed until it disappeared from my vision.   4 F-16s in total took off and circled the airport for aproximately 30 mins, then landed and taxied back to the Air Guard base.   2 had local Oklahoma 138th FW  tail markings and 2 had Ohio 180th FW markings.;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546
Gigantic disc seem very clearly Tulsa International Airport. I can't be the only one that ever seen it was so gigantic;2020-01-04 15:15:00;2-3 minutes;Gigantic disc seem very clearly Tulsa International Airport. I can't be the only one that ever seen it was so gigantic I am an over-the-road truck driver.  I was out walking my dog left my phone in the truck.  I see he coming from a distance through the airport a gigantic disc shape moving swiftly I can only say maybe 60 miles an hour not fast and cast a huge shadow.  As telephone poles to the altitude it was traveling I would have to say about three telephone poles and height very low.  I would have to say a Croft maybe 500 Dave 800 feet I don't know at the end to stories hi and on the bottom very flat but on top had an angle and got higher towards the center.  There were multiple colored lights White and blood red however they did not seem to cast like a flashlight wood on the shadow below it.  When it got about six seven hundred yards away it seemed to just cloak.  The image beyond it with I've just a very few clouds we're distorted as if it were still there but cloaked and even the shadow below it seem to disappear when it cloaked.;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546
