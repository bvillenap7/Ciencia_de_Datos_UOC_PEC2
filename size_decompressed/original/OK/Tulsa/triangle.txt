Five Black Triangles In Formation Directly Overhead;2000-10-22 22:00:00;10 minutes;Five Black Triangles In Formation Directly Overhead There were five black triangles in the sky directly overhead of my vantage point.  They were moving very slowly in a due south direction.  The formation was in the shape of a cross with one triangular craft in the front, then three black triangular crafts.  The line of three black triangular crafts was perpendicular to an invisible line from the center of the first triangular craft to the center of the trailing black triangular craft.  That particular craft was trailing a little distance in the rear of the main formation.   All of them had very small red lights on all three tips of their triangular shapes.  The center craft in the formation had a bright white strobing light directly in the center  on the bottom.  The shapes were each about the size of a dime held at arms length.  There was absolutely no discernable sound from the formation before they were overhead, during the flyover, and after they'd passed.  They were totally silent, almost as if they were five black phantoms (ghosts).   So far, NOBODY has given me an explanation of what they are, or were.  They DEFINITELY weren't B-2 bombers or F-117 aircraft.  I'm very familiar with those military planes and the shape of their wings.  I've heard of black triangular flying objects before, but never any details about them.   I don't carry a camera around with me and had never seen unexplained flying objects before, so I went home and created a .gif of the formation and shapes of the craft I saw.   Being a trained illustrator for 25 years, having a BFA in art, and a USAF veteran who spent many nights on guard at USAF bases, I am a trained observer.  Like I said, I'd never seen UFOs before and don't anticipate ever seeing anything like that again.   BTW, I called my youngest son (30 yrs old) outside to look at the sight and he saw them, too.  His comment was, WEIRD, quickly followed by, don't you ever tell anyone my name and that I witnessed it.  I don't need a bunch of  people crawling all over my yard and microphones stuck up to my face.   I guess that makes me the only reliable witness in my family.;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546
Triangular Craft in Sky Last Night;2003-08-25 22:35:00;2 minutes;Triangular Craft in Sky Last Night I thought maybe it was a plane or jet of some sort but I couldn't find anything that looked like it when searching for pictures of jets, and planes, and stealth jets. The craft that I saw was like nothing I'd ever seen before.  It was a perfect equalateral triangle, and was very large...  the size of a commercial airplane in length.  I've grown accustomed to seeing various aircraft in my area, as I live about 2-3 miles from an airport, so most air traffic crosses over my house, but it usually comes from the East when flying low, as that is the direction the airport is from me.  This craft came from the South...  It was flying very low, just above my roof and the treetops nearby, traveling at a reasonably fast pace, but just slow enough over me to where I could stand in awe wondering what it was and memorize its every detail in passing.  Each corner of the triangle had a very bright light that was like a spotlight shining down on the ground, and each light was equal in brightness.  It wasn't completely quiet, yet it wasnt' very loud either.  The noise it made was sort of soft humming sound.  I first noticed it when I saw the bright lights coming over my roof as I was laying in the hammock in my backyard looking up to the sky towards Mars.  The lights were really bright and at first in the distance I thought it was a Police Helicopter spotlighting for a criminal or something, but it wasn't loud enough to be a helicopter so I thought it odd.  It came quickly over my roof, covering about a mile in a few seconds.  When it was over my back yard area, it slowed down quite a bit.  The 3 lights shined down into my backyard and then after it passed by it sped up again and took off so fast I couldn't see it anymore in a matter of seconds, due North.  After seeing it, I thought it must be some hi-tech jet of some sort, but after looking for about an hour online thru various pictures of jets and planes, I saw nothing close to it.  Then I did a search on U.F.O.  and found a site that had drawings of a craft that looked EXACTLY like what I saw!  Then I came to this site today and decided to report what I saw last night.  I am still amazed by what I saw... I don't know if this was something top secret, millitary, or something not of this world, but whatever the case, it was a phenomenal sight.  I have a drawing I made of the craft available if you are interested in seeing it.;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546
UFO Sighting in Tulsa, OK;2009-04-15 01:00:00;10-15 seconds;UFO Sighting in Tulsa, OK On a calm night in April of this year, 2009, two of my friends and I saw something that we'll never forget. At least, I won't. We were down in an urban ravine, just hanging out and talking like friends do. I was the first one to look up and, in awe, see the unidentified flying object. I couldn't tell you how large or high up it was. All I know is that it was humongous, completely silent, and cruising slowly yet stealthily. Its luminous, phosphorescent lights made its shape out to be triangular or boomerang-like in nature, although the craft itself seemed to be cloaked. The whole spectacle lasted approximately ten to fifteen seconds until it just vanished. One of my friends later told me that he felt like he was being watched when it flew by. My other friend simply dismissed it as either a skein of geese, a weather balloon or swamp gas. But I know what I saw, and I'm sure that it wasn't either of those things, especially since another witness told me that three helicopters, two 'regular,' and one black, were scouting the area soon after the UFO had disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546

I was doing a report on trespassers on a 6 deck parking garage and finished it was during the meteor shower.  I seen a bright light I thought it was a star or a planet cause it did not move.  It was in the north east around 1 o'clock area.  I viewed a light I thought was a meteor it went straight toward the the bright light then stopped.  The light I was watching suddenly took off and headed south. by the time I called my guard he was 4 miles away it was gone but when it went over my head I seen it was triangle shaped and had bright white lights on the corners and a big light in the middle  .It was from start to finish when it moved out of sight it might have been 1 minute.  It was the fastest thing I have ever seen. I have seen airplanes coming and going from the same place but they did not even get close to how fast the it moved.;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546

Pyramid shaped UFO sighted over Southern Hills Golf Course Wednesday, April 23rd over TULSA, OKLAHOMA.;2014-04-23 22:40:00;4-5 minutes;Pyramid shaped UFO sighted over Southern Hills Golf Course Wednesday, April 23rd over TULSA, OKLAHOMA. At 24:40, Wednesday, April 23rd 2014, I was driving in neighborhood from pharmacy.  I was traveling west on 75th Avenue when I noticed two very bright lights.  I thought it was just another car traveling because the two bright lights moved fluently and very smoothly much like a car with its brights on over the hills.  With so many hills in our neighborhood I thought nothing of it. I quickly realized I was wrong.  The two lights were not coming from a car but from a craft in the sky.  I realized it was a UFO.  The bright lights continued from west to east, fluently, over the trees and then made a right turn.  This turn  i would guess to be a 45 degree turn,  which allowed me to see two sides forming a v-shape.  It was moving at a steady rate of traffic so I would guess it was flying 45 to 50 mph. I turned the corner, heading north on Jamestown, as the UFO was directly past.  I turned the corner and decided to follow.   I was able to keep my eyes on it the entire time as I headed North on Harvard.  I immediately turned left. I could now make out the pyramid shape of the object from radiating off the golf course and also told me the craft  was now at 65th street between Harvard and Lewis.    At Lewis, the craft continued on till Riverside Drive then headed north following the interstate.   I got held up at the light and was unable to see it about a minute later when the five cars ahead of me had turned.   I am certain others had to have seen this UFO in Tulsa and I am guessing it was the same craft that was identified in Kansas. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to provide no contact information.

At least one craft with very bright lights very low in the sky seen by 2 people in Tulsa.;2014-07-15 22:30:00;15-20 minutes;At least one craft with very bright lights very low in the sky seen by 2 people in Tulsa. My friend and I were driving east and we saw an extremely bright light in the sky.  It did not appear to be moving and it did appear to be twinkling so I assumed it was a star.   I got out my stargazing app to see what star looked so large and close and there was no major star in that particular spot.   We drove for about 3 more miles and eventually it seemed to make a triangular shape.  For a few minutes it looked as if there were 2 but we aren't sure.   It started to get much clearer and it appeared to look like a craft flying extremely close to the ground but not landing or taking off.  It also at this point appeared to move a little bit and then stop again.  Then we turned north and to our surprise the light seemed to reappear to our left and it continued to move with us.   Then we turned east and it appeared behind us, then disappeared.;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546

The craft was triangular in shape and flashed three colors-red, blue and white.   It defied physics by making several right turns coming vertical.  It would go up slowly then come down slowly.  It moved very fast and then hovered for about 2 minutes over us, and then it went into the clouds and disappeared;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546

Tulsa UFO with amazing flight path at speed.;2015-10-29 06:36:00;15-20 seconds;Tulsa UfO with amazing flight path at speed. I am a factually based MD radiologist practicing in a major medical center.  I have never had an experience of this nature. I was sitting in a hot tub shortly before dawn, when a more delta-like boomerang shaped object with a round apex and sharper back corners came into view far away on the eastern horizon.  It had no running lights, and was only faintly identifiable in the night sky as a vague pearlescent entity.  There were no clouds in the sky.   At first, I thought it was an ultralight, but it was so high that the shape never changed as it migrated from my 12 o'clock to my 4 o'clock position in a straight line.  There was no sound. At the 4 o'clock  position, it made a severe 90 degree turn south with no indication of banking or change in shape.  The turn was executed as a smooth alteration in course occurring in a space of approximately 2-3 times the width of the object with no change in speed.  It headed south for 2-3 more seconds and then disappeared from sight abruptly without any preceding alteration in speed or direction.;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546
Three separate crafts taking off in a 90 degree angle.;2016-05-14 02:15:00;5 minutes;Three separate crafts taking off in a 90 degree angle. Around 2:15 am, I was letting my dogs outside before we went to bed, and as I looked up at the sky off to the southwestern direction I saw three crafts with flashing lights in a triangle shape.  I then saw two crafts, appear in the center of the triangle shoot off in a ball of light and very fast.  The smaller crafts took off in a northern direction and seconds after that the triangle split up and took off in a strait upward direction in a 90 degree angle.   Very shocking I got the dogs in and closed the blinds and did not see any further craft or UFO’s in the sky.  I will say it was amazing, and exiting all at the same time.;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546

Passenger aircraft flew directly over the craft and moved much slower, easily identifiable as passenger jet.  The three crafts appeared to be flying at a high speed, and made no sound.   Following the sighting, immediately, aircraft traffic increased to a rate of half a dozen within 15 minutes of sighting.  All were using what I would describe as search lights to communicate morse code.  Very abnormal behavior.  30 minutes later, a single unknown craft identical to the first 3 was observed for 25 seconds, flying from northeast to south.;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546

Made quick 90* turns. stopped then accelerated out of sight to west Its been a couple days of thought and analysis since Friday, August 9, at 5:20 pm.  It was sunny and 100+ degrees as I finished readying the inflatable pool to entertain my soon to arrive grandchildren the next morning.  At the far end of my driveway where I was filling the pool, an opening between the trees and rooftops provided a small window of observation to the Southwest as the sun was setting. I cast my gaze to that area and wasn’t surprised to see motion in the cloudless sky. The river a half mile away attracts many predator type birds, hawks, eagles, vultures who circle the area looking for a meal. At first that is what I thought I saw even though there were no other birds in the sky and no sounds in the air. Each thing I describe is worth noting. Friday at 5 pm everyone downtown has left for the burbs. They aren’t watching the skies, they aren’t pausing to watch wildlife.  The heat wave we’ve been experiencing is too extreme for the birds to be active lest they expire.  As I adjusted my new sunglasses I watched him....it.  Too far away, too high in the air to be a bird. At that distance a bird, even an Eagle, would have looked smaller. So, I took the sunglasses off to get a different look. It was gone. Put them back on...it reappeared.  Okay, I mused, these are polarized. Must make a difference. But it isn’t a bird.  As if to confirm that, it began a slow, easy turn and then stopped in mid-air. I am used to seeing birds search for wind currents and appear to be still when working a heat draft or a headwind.  I find that entertaining.  What I am not used to seeing is birds making a quick, tight, “S” curve, a hard right, stop again and then accelerate out of sight to the West. I considered that we have a National Guard base nearby and when those guys do acrobatics and high speed take offs, it is impressive but at that height their silhouette and small size make them hard to even see. They don’t make clean 90 degree turns either.  And the sound they leave behind during acceleration to get to that altitude is recognizable.  This vehicle was at the height that multi engine bombers fly at, higher than most commercial planes and unlikely to be doing the maneuvers I observed.  It didn’t seem to be one of the Guard fighters.;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546
Triangular object with a single white bright light on each corner. Hovered until I got closer and then took off north;2020-02-13 23:04:00;13 minutes;Triangular object with a single white bright light on each corner. vHovered until I got closer and then took off north Saw two bright lights in the sky while traveling eastbound on I44  Figured it was a plane that was just facing my direction but they got brighter as I got closer.  Seemed like the lights were about 30 feet apart, judging by the rate at which the lights separated as I drove closer. From the highway, looked like it was right over 51st but farther east, so I got off on Harvard and started driving east toward Yale. vIt got bigger as I drove closer, so it looked like it was hovering.  As I was about to reach Yale, a third light appeared in between and under the other two, forming the triangle shape.  At this point it looked like it was right over 51st and Sheridan, so I kept driving east and rolled my windows down to see if there was any noise there wasn't.  Right about when I got to Hudson, the triangle took off going north-northeast, ramping up speed to maybe 60mph over the course of 10 seconds.  As it began moving, the corner lights started blinking in sequence and a few smaller red lights could be seen in between the corners. I hit a red light and couldn't follow.  Tried to get a video but it's not really usable.  Can only see the lights for a split second as they're moving away and it's unfocused/shaky because I was driving.;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546
