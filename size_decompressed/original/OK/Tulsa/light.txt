Light far away in sky racing away from a location & back twice to again race away and not return;1976-06-15 22:45:00;45 SECS;Light far away in sky racing away from a location & back twice to again race away and not return This sighting corresponds quite closely to a sighting reported in Salina, Kansas, on 09/20/73. I have estimated a date/year in which this occured.  I am unsure if it was indeed 1976. It could have been 1975. First off, I am a realist.  I don't fall easily into the ghost/UFO sighting scene, but I know what I saw and it was very unexplainable. I was in my bedroom at approx. 2245 hrs. and just laying in my bed looking out the window when up in the sky in a west southwest direction I observed what at first I thought was a possible satellite.  I was in Boy Scouts at the time and we would always point out a certain satellite that would bounce up and down and change colors.  This object did not change colors but was moving up,down, and back & forth.  Then it raced away towards the North completely out of sight and at an unimaginable rate of speed, but within seconds came back to the approx. area in which it first was.  It then raced off again at an incredible speed and returned again, but this time it came back from a different angle.  Again, it raced off which looked to be a diagonal direction upwards but again to the North.  It never returned. I remained at the window for at least an hour just hoping it would return. My next door neighbors were out of town visiting family in Topeka, Kansas. When they returned, I informed my friend what I had seen and overhearing me was her mother. She informed me that while they were in Topeka that some neighbors of their relatives also saw the exact same thing in the sky. I am now 43 years old and a Deputy Sheriff.  At the time, I was approx. 9-10 years old.  This sighting has always bothered me since that time.  I read all these fantastic reports and they sound really silly.  But what I saw was totally genuine and I would really like to know of similar reports of this sighting.  I can't be the only one that saw this.  If in Kansas it was also seen, then I would think many people also saw it.  I am very determined to investigate this occurance just to possibly get some answers.;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546

Object was seen directly overhead and moving at a constant fast speed.  Object had a amber glow and did not change colors or shape. object was a round light.  Witnesses followed light for about two blocks but Object was moving too fast to catch.  Object was low enough to fly under low cloud cover but light was too small to be a conventional aircraft.  Object had no wings and no flashing lights associated with conventional aircraft(such as on wings or atop).  Object was out of witnesses sight for 2 seconds and then was not seen again.

Meteor w/ sparks.;1999-07-22 02:00:00;seconds;Meteor w/ sparks. Decided to report this after hearing reports from 9/1-9/2/99. I am not sure of the date, but it was the next to or the last week July and I was working overnights.  I took a late coffee break and went to the roof to see the sky for a few minutes.  I was facing south when I saw a bright light out of the corner of my eye.  I turned to my right and in the NW part of the sky, I saw a meteor heading almost straight down (maybe at a 5o'clock angle).  It was VERY bright and seemed to slow down as it went out. It then quickly brightened again for just a moment only this time, throwing gold/copper sparks from its backside, before burning out. This is my second report in a short time as you may already know.  I sent a report of my light sighting from Jenks, OK.  You may contact me if you feel the need.;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546
Quick moving light that faded out.;2001-01-06 21:15:00;10 seconds;Quick moving light that faded out. I was standing in the parking lot of an apartment complex 8-10 miles South of the Tulsa airport talking to family members.  I looked up to see what I originally thought were airplane lights traveling North, but they seemed too high for our proximity to the airport.  Then, I noted that the light appeared to be moving too fast to be an airplane that high.  Just before it disappeared behind the top of one of the buildings, the light faded out like a meteorite would and was gone. The light appeared to be generally round in shape. There were at least two colors as if it were landing lights, but they were not spread out like landing lights on a jumbo jet. I suppose it could have been a small, private jet heading for a landing.  That would explain why it appeared to be too high and fast to be a jumbo jet.  But, then, why did the lights fade out?;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546
2 bright lights with sparkling trails moving in figure 8 pattern;2001-10-26 19:00:00;3 minutes;2 bright lights with sparkling trails moving in figure 8 pattern I was called outside at approx 7:00pm CST on Friday Oct 26th to look at something in the sky.  At first glance I thought the 2 lights looked like a plane, another person said it's a comet, I kept looking and watching the objects with 6 other people. They were white in color left a sparkling trail behind them and were moving in a figure 8 pattern. I watched the objects cross each other in the pattern 4 times. They continued to move in the pattern and descended in altitude untill some trees blocked our line of sight.  The direction that we were facing was NE.  I also during this time witnessed an aircraft under them moving from East to North, when the craft passed the Left object/light it did a 180 and started moving back the way it came. The UFO's were much brighter than the aircraft and much larger in size. I did not hear any sound of engines. The ufos were not moving in any direction other than a loss in altitude.;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546
Slowly moving red (then orange) flickering light joined for a time by a faster moving white light.;2001-12-31 23:40:00;5-10min;Slowly moving red (then orange) flickering light joined for a time by a faster moving white light. At appx 11:40cst, I saw a fairly bright red light moving very slowly toward my location, appx north to south.  I first assumed that this was normal air traffic (probably around 30-35 degrees above the northern horizon)  but it was moving slower than what I thought was normal.  After a couple of minutes, I turned my head away for a couple of seconds and when I looked back at the light, there was a second light, white and not as bright moving from appx west to east at a faster, but not very fast speed. Had this been a 2-D screen, the second light would have been slightly below the red light.  It did not seem to be moving fast enough for me NOT to have seen it before I turned my head, i.e. it seemed to appear from nowhere.   After about 30 seconds, the white light just went out.  This got me kind of excited and I continued to watch the red light which never blinked as much as it sort of flickered, now much closer to my location still moving VERY slowly.  At times it seemed as though the light had come to a stop.  As it continued moving toward to the south (now about 45 degrees off the horizon) I realized that it had become more copperish orange in color.  I am almost sure that it came to a stop and then began moving more easterly.  It moved very slowly for maybe 20 seconds before in dimmed to the brightness of a dim star and then went out.  I kept looking for about 2 more minutes before I decided it was not going to reappear and I had to go back inside (I was at work and was watching from the first floor roof of my job site, taking my coffee break checking out the sky as I always do on my overnight shift.)  The moon was somewhat overhead and could be seen fairly clearly through a thin clould layer.  There was a slight ring around it and I could see a bright star, actually probably the planet Jupiter through this same thin cloud layer.  There was a slight band of heavier clouds between the moon and where I saw the lights but I am 90% sure that the lights did not disappear behind any clouds. ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION))  The red (to orange)light moved in a straight line until just before it disappeared when it appeared to stop for a moment or two and then began heading east. (Again, the very slow speed of the object was, to me, very strange and what really kept my attention.)  I agree that a white light moving slowly and then disappearing, under other conditions, would beg to be labeled a satellite, but the conditions at this location, in that direction and under these weather conditions was not right for a satellite.  One of my hobbies on weekend nights, when I do not work is to sit in my backyard and hope to see meteors.  I have seen many satellites and I would bet the farm that this was not one.  This light, though not  blinding was at least as bright as Jupiter, considering that Jupiter was dimmed somewhat by the icy haze in the air.  It seemed too low in the sky to have been a satellite and the fact that it appeared so suddenly and so close to the red light (probably two to three fingers width at arms length lower than the red light) was at best very coincidental.  The location I was at is just not conducive to seeing satellites.  One cannot even see stars that low in the sky facing north.  Its just too close to downtown Tulsa.  Too much light.  Of course, I could be wrong.  Thanks again. ((name deleted)) in OKlahoma PS Say hi to Jeff for me next time you are on the show.;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546

I saw a super-bright light standing still for 30 seconds and a minute later it was moving;2003-07-31 03:00:00;1 minute;I saw a super-bright light standing still for 30 seconds and a minute later it was moving Ok I listed above that this happened on July 31st 2003 but I'm not sure that is the right date. But I know this happened between July 25 and August 5th. It was approximately 0300 hours. I walked onto my porch and sat down on. I looked up at the sky and I saw an unusually bright light. I gazed at it for about 30 seconds and wondered what it could be. At first I thought it must be a satellite. But I have never seen a satellite this bright. Then I thought maybe its a planet, but I have never seen a planet this bright either. Well I dismissed it (by the way I wasn't drinking) and I dont use drugs. Well about a minute later I looked back up and it was moving about as fast as an airplane in a straight line for about 10 seconds until the trees obscured it. It was west of me moving westward. It had no flashing lights, no colored lights. Now I am a skeptic. When this happened I thought it must have been a helicopter, but it looked as high as a star and had no flashing. I thought maybe I should call an agency and report it but I am pretty skeptical about UFO's and I thought what are the chances that I, someone who doesnt believe in UFO's, is going to see one. So I figured I would get online and see if anyone else reported a UFO that night. No one did. I haven't told anyone except my friend because people would think I'm crazy the same way I do about other people who report seeing UFO's. I was talking to my friend tonight and he is into UFO's and told me I should at least report it to you. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We suspect Mars may be the cause of the sighting.

slightly dim gold light, not blindingly bright.;2007-08-17 05:15:00;10-15 seconds;slightly dim gold light, not blindingly bright. On the way back into our suburban neighborhood that I have lived in for the past year now, me and my roommate both immediately noticed a gold light completely out of place hovering higher than any tree or the obvious orange(obvious as in the street lights are a completely different color as well as brightness and size) colored street lights. View became obstructed by trees driving into the neighborhood, in shock immediately turned around going opposite direction while I viewed from behind trying to catch the object but it was not in site. I would say it was probaly about 150-200 yards at 1'oclock ahead  of us and hovering maybe 120 feet above the ground.

A white light circling in and out of the side of a thunderstom and planes moving to intercept it.;2008-06-13 22:20:00;10 minutes;A white light circling in and out of the side of a thunderstom and planes moving to intercept it. I went outside to smoke a cigarette and watch the approaching storm from the south when something from the west caught my eye, it was a circle shaped white light coming out of the side of the thunderstorm.   I watched it for a few moments before it circled back into the storm,  I knew it wasn’t a plane because they can’t move like that.    Right as that one went into the clouds another one shot out of the clouds and then circled right back in.   Could have been the same object, but I never saw them both at the same time out of the clouds.   So after about ten minutes of watching this I see a plane flying slowly from the east in the objects direction, as I’m watching that one another plane comes in really fast from the north I would imagine to intercept the object.   As I look back to see the object it was gone just as the fast moving plane goes into the side of the storm cloud.   The lightning was really bright but it was further to the south of me, I didn’t see any lightning bolt just the flashes through the clouds.   I think the edge of the storm is where I was and the object was going in and out through the side of the storm.   So that’s my account just thought id let you know.;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546
Round white light/object moving through sky and suddenly disappearing;2008-10-08 19:30:00;60 seconds;Round white light/object moving through sky and suddenly disappearing Tulsa Oklahoma:  Approximately 7:30 PM CST on 10-8-08:  I saw an object in the Northern sky. At first I thought it was Venus by the shape, size and brightness. But then I quickly realized that's not where Venus is located and also noticed the object was moving, heading East South East. At first I thought, oh well, must be a plane. But as I watched, I saw that it was not moving like a plane would move and it still looked like Venus, not a plane. So I grabbed my binoculars and looked at the object more closely. What I saw was a white, round object made of just one white round light. The object left no trail, had no other lights around it and moved at a fairly steady rate of speed. I watched the object for about 45-60 seconds and all of the sudden, it just flat disappeared. I don't mean it slowly went out of sight, more that, all of the sudden, it was just flat gone. There was no sound from the object, it did not change colors.;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546

At first we thought it was a “shooting star,” but instead of streaking and fading, it flashed on and off as it moved rapidly across the sky in a straight path.

Two bright, motionless lights in Tulsa's northern sky.;2009-10-16 05:19:00;45-50 seconds;Two bright, motionless lights in Tulsa's northern sky. While looking due north, what seemed to be a faint star appeared. The single “star” remained faint for about ten seconds, then quickly grew in brightness. At maximum brightness, which was maintained for no more than 15 seconds and was as bright or brighter than Venus on a clear night, a second faint “star” appeared at about twenty degrees higher in the sky. The first “star” faded and disappeared completely within five seconds. Then, the second “star” grew in brightness, just as the first “star” did. This brightness was also maintained for no more than fifteen seconds. Just as the first did, the second “star” faded and disappeared completely within five seconds.  Both objects remained motionless in the sky. As far as I was able to determine, there were no clouds in the sky as I could see stars all around, fully formed constellations, and even the “north star”.;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546
Two different colored lights, stationary & above the clouds.;2010-03-23 23:00:00;15 minutes;Two different colored lights, stationary & above the clouds. Standing outside of Cain's Ballroom, looked up and saw two larger stationary lights one blueish grey and one orange.  The blueish light was horseshoe shaped, with sharpish points.  The orange light was more circular, but not perfect.  The lights faded and came back in intensity as the clouds passed under.  The two lights were directly overhead.  The moon was visible to the northwest and a star was visible slightly northwest.  Eventually, the clouds overpowered the lights, and they disappeared.  Also worth noting, this was near downtown Tulsa so the building lights overpowered a lot of weaker star light.  These lights were far enough above any manmade structure, as well as above the clouds, to be sure that there was nothing that any of us could think of what could be causing it.;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546

I was heading east, but looking north at the light fog over the pond caused by the unusually cold May temperatures.  Suddenly, a round extremely bright white light darted above the pond just above the tree tops going at a speed equivalent to that of a car on the highway.  I witnessed it travel north approximatley 250-300 feet.  Relative to a star, it was about the same size.  But since it appeared so close to the ground, I would estimate it was about the size of a fist.  It appeared the object was flying level, neither gaining nor losing altitude.

At first, I thought it might be Venus or some bright star but the sky was way too bright, even at sunset.  We chatted a bit and we would occasionally glance up to look at the stationary object some more.  After about a min or two, the object simply vanished. As for a description of the object, it was extremely bright and slightly elongated horizontally. (cigar shaped?)  I thought it might be sunlight reflecting off of a jet, but due to the fact that it was stationary led me to believe otherwise.  In any case, none of us could identify it.  It vanished in an instant.

The mosquitoes are bad this time of year, so I would go in the house and come out again and look.  This continued until I went to bed about an hour and a half later.  I wish I had stayed up now!

Floating bright object.;2018-07-04 21:15:00;40 minutes;Floating bright object Floating/stationary object in sky.  Noticed it while waiting for fireworks. Was extremely bright at first, but it since has slightly adjusted its position and brightness.  Planes/helicopters have flown almost close to it and continue to circle it seems like.  Too bright to be a star and too low.  It has only moved ever so slightly so it's not a plane or helicopter.  Started at 9:15 PM or so;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546
At least three lights in the sky and vanish.;2019-06-13 21:10:00;approximately 1-2 minutes;At least three lights in the sky and vanish. I saw a light moving really fast for only a matter of of seconds in the sky from East to West and vanish.  A second later another light going from North West to South East and vanish and several seconds later another this time from South to North and vanish.;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546
Multi-color rotating star object;2019-11-08 21:00:00;all night long;Multi-color rotating star object Tulsa, Oklahoma.  I regularly observe strange, color-twinkling star-like objects, in the four quadrants of the sky.  They appear to be regularly positioned and are clearly no ordinary “star” or “planet”.  They appear, to the naked eye, as almost a dice-shaped device, “spinning” on one of its corners, and flashing regularly, white, green, and red.  I am 63 years old and have been sky watching all of my life and cannot explain what these new objects in the sky are.  I first noticed them in 2012.  I called the St. Louis Planetarium in hopes that someone there could clue me in to what these objects are but the only response I got was someone trying to convince me about the “twinkling” that occurs as bodies in space rise or set through our atmosphere, especially near the horizons.  I felt that my questions were quickly dismissed.  My gut tells me that these are some kind of UFO and/or military crafts.  I find the objects disconcerting, especially since very few ! people notice them or even care about hearing about them.;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546
