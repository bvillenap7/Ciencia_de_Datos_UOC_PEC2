It was brownish red/amber in color and shape was oval- tear drop,hard to explain but I will draw a picture of it.It had some sort of membrane/aura or field around it. Since I already had my binoculars in my hand, I zoomed in on it up close it was squared off in the front like a bay windows yet rounded as it tapered off towards the back,it was totally silent did not make any wild manoeuvres, Stayed at constant speed, no lights or flashing lights at all, it just traveled a straight low line until I could no longer see it.No way was it a balloon, it was a dead air night no wind whatsoever.Left no smoke/com trail.When observed through binoculars the membrane was transparent, and oval in shape.I could see through membrane but the teardrop shaped craft was solid with defenent shape.I did not panic, felt no fear or anxiety, just intent on details. Plus it was traveling too fast on a horizontal heading.It was not a plane for it had no wings and as close as it was I would have heard the engines, this craft was silent.I would guess the size -30x20x5' towards the back. I honestly can say now that I have seen something in the sky that I can not explain..It was not a satellite, plane,swamp gas,hang glider, balloon,jet,dirigible,shooting star,or helicopter .I know the constellations,I have see MANY satellites and shooting stars, we live in a City with a International Airport so I have seen all kinds of aircraft including stealth military aircraft.By its description It sounds like what a friend and his father saw about the first of June 08.The one they saw was flying at tree top level at a constant speed,with some manoeuvring and in the same area of the city.It also had that weird membrane, was teardop in shape the only difference was the craft they saw was emitting a reddish light and was much lower.I realize this is only anecdotal evidence, one mans story, but I will never forget it and from now I will have a camera along with my telescope and binoculars!;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546
