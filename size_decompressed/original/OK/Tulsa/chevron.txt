Then the lights went off I could still see th outline of the craft was still visible and moving slowly ..THIS WAS NOT A CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT!!! there were 5 lights ..If I was to explain the shape I could connect the lights 3 lights would form a triangle shape, two more lights Aft of the crafts direction would be slightly wider than the triangles base, But this only describes the shape all of these lights were on a somewhat horizontal plain...all moved together I couls see the actual craft then the lighs all turned off at one time and the ground lights were bright enough to see the shape still ............I was frightened and ran inside yelling for my wife...;36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546
