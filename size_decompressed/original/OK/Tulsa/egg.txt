Metallic, egg-shaped, silent, low-flying, object.;2002-06-13 14:00:00;1 minute;Metallic, egg-shaped, silent, low-flying, object. The object I witnessed flew over my house in the early afternoon.  I live under a common commercial and military flight path so I'm used to seeing interesting jets and planes flying overhead.   This object caught my eye because it was not only flying in the wrong direction from the usual flight path, but it was also perfectly silent, leaving no trail.  The object seemed to be roughly the size of a short school bus and flying about 40 stories high at probably 50 mph.  It was heading perfectly North.  The speed stayed consistent as I watched it fly beyond the horizon.  The object was more of a chrome I'd say than silver.  It reflected the ground an sky like a mirror.  The object also flew with the slightly smaller end pointed North in the direction it was heading. I hope this helps anyone who may have seen a similar object.  I've always wondered what it may be and if anyone else has seen the same. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));36.1119170172083;-95.9381022944546
