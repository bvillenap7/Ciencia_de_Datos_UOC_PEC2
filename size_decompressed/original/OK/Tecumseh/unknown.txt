My husband had stepped on to our front porch facing North and saw something in the sky. I came outside to see and there was an object that at first appeared to be somewhat kite shaped. That is what we origionally thought it was. Then I noticed another object above it that the lower object appeared to be hanging from. There were two more appeared to the Eastern side of the object so that it formed a sideways triangle shape. At one point there were 5 of them atleast around the origional object. It was a metallic silver in color and shiny. The sky was clear and it was sunny out. As we watched the objects disappeared from sight. I managed to take one photo but my camera was low on battery and that is all I was able to get. It is not a very good photo but you can see two of them in it.;35.2487;-96.9673
