Bright light flying past in the night.  ((NUFORC Note:  Witness is former member of USAF.  PD));2006-12-31 19:45:00;40 seconds;Bright light flying past in the night I first noticed the Light out of the corner of my eye.  To the south, a bright oblong shape, white light Flying West to East.  I wasn't wearing my glasses at the moment, but as soon as I noticed this object the light had toned down to an Amber color,  then moments later the Amber light toned downed again. To a (Pinpoint) of one or Two red Lights Which faded out quickly.  So then the entire Craft was lost in the darkness, still on a east to west course no lights at all.   I'm  a retired Air Force Radar Operator. My Last 11 Years in the Service was with AWACS as a Crewmember.  This sighting although very Brief was clearly not an aircraft of any sort.   One: The complete absence of Standard Navigational  lights.  Two: The sighting had no associated engine Sounds, no sound at all.  the Object while heading to the west, was I estimate doing  around 130 Knots Airspeed, and it was  low, maybe 2000 ft.   I have Oak Trees 45 to 50 feet high and it just above the top brances.  The size of the object can't be determined.  Nor the shape. It was just a light.  Although my gut feeling tells me it was small and close. (the Pinpoint red light just before it faded was a lot like the afterglow of a Halogen light when switched off).;35.2487;-96.9673
