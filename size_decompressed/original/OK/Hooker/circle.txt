On the morning of March 30, 2000 3:30-4:00 a.m.between Hooker & Guymon, Ok (in what looks like an industrial park)I witnessed a bright orange pulsing light that seamed to be directly over this area. At first I thought it was a fire at sone refinery but I've been going on this route for 8 weeks and never saw it before. As I passed the area it seamed to stay alined with my truck as thogh it were moving. This went on for about 10 to 15 minutes(18 miles)then I lost sight of the object.The object seamed very close to the ground.;36.8109;-101.2163
Large, bright orb moved across sky in irregular patterns before vanishing.;2014-12-07 06:55:00;45 seconds;Large, bright orb moved across sky in irregular patterns before vanishing. Saw large, bright orb in sky SSW of my location about 75 degrees high.  Object had no change in appearance, had no trail, no flashing, blinking, or strobe-like effects associated with it. Object moved in straight path for 5-8 seconds in a N bound direction, then began to curve slowly and smoothly to the west, to the east, and began heading west again. There were several blinking aircraft visible to show reference to what a jet/plane behavior would look like, but it held no similarities in shape, color, speed or movement.  As the object moved closer to 80 degrees above me, it banked more towards the west and seemed to increase in luminosity and size slightly.  As the object moved into the western portion of the sky, again about 65-70 degrees above me now, a recognizable aircraft (jet/plane) came into view directly above me moving in a WWN direction.  It seemed as if the red flashing plane was nearly on an intercept course as they moved closer and closer together. The plane/jet did have a slightly visible chem-trail, and as the object seemed right about to intersect with the plane/jet, the jet turned almost directly W, avoiding the entities intersecting.  The object then curved slowly and steadily toward a NNW path, and suddenly vanished about 8-10 seconds later. On a most likely unrelated note, the very instant the object vanished, coyotes all round me began to howl for about 30 seconds.  This is common in my region at night, and was probably attributable to the sudden visibility of the moon (red on the horizon) peeking over the edge of the lights of Hooker.;36.8109;-101.2163
