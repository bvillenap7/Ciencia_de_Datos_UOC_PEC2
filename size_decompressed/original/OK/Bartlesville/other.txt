On the evening approx.6:00 pm Mid October(the 17th to my best recollection), 1986 in Bartlesville, OK. Myself, at the time 9 years old and my father(((deleted))at the time employed by ((company deleted))) stopped offlocal station(what brand of station I do not recall)on the way home from a scout meeting. As we were filling up, the attendant pointed out somthing unusual in the sky, at first could not see it but as I looked up in front of me facing a northern sky I saw a orangish-red colored object/craft. It stood out aainst the sky, it was shapped like a stretched nerf-football, almost ovular, but with cuved top and botton wich came to faded ends and surrounded by a arorea of light. At first the craft was in a vertical positon, and proceeded to move down very slowly at a relatively high altitude(I'd dare a guess of 2-6 thousand feet up) then the craft, well,I guess the word is flipped or rotated into a horizontal postion in place, maintaing the same saucer/ovular shape. It then proceeded to very slowly move across the sky towards the north/east but in a line right across just as it had gone in a line staright down. Then suddenly it bolted of the east and was gone. The sky was relatively well lit as it was fall in that part of the country, and this whole event we witnessed for about 10 minutes. I have no idea how long the craft had been in the area or of other sightings. It made no noise, but all 3 of us concured it was like nothing we had ever seen. At first we thought it might be the exausht fire form a hot air ballon or some other plane, but when it did those manuevers, I knew of nothing and still do not that could do that. When it took off it bolted, I mean....just slightly slower than you can blink, so it went from crusing to that in nothing flat. I drew a picture when I got home, but do not have the original, both I and my  father told my mother about it upon arrival home. That is most of what I can recall of the event, although my father,myself,and the gas attendent are sure we saw some sort of craft-unlike anything I have seen. I have no idea what it was to this day. I have since moved(since 1989)back to where my parents are both originally from to California, and have lived in Redondo Beach for the past ten years.;36.74143;-95.9415162500001
((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  PD))  I sighted a prismic diamond-shaped object that glowed yellow green hovering over the trees.;2005-10-15 20:15:00;roughly 15-30 seconds;I sighted a prismic diamond-shaped object that glowed yellow green hovering over the trees by my church. Well, it was about the time I described above, and I was at my church. I went outside for a bit of fresh air, and I looked over some of the trees around the church. I saw an almost prismic,diamond-shaped object with a steady glow of yellow green florescent light around it hovering over the trees.   It moved like a plane, but there was no engine sound and there were no flashing lights like there would be on the wings of a plane.  I watched and followed it until it went behind some trees, and I looked, but never saw it again. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  Possible hoax.  PD));36.74143;-95.9415162500001

I just saw a huge boomerang craft heading south on Highway 75 towards Tulsa.  No noise.   It was black and dark very high in the night sky.  This thing was real.   Again no noise.  I would say it was 10-20k feet, but had to have been at least a quarter mile in length. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he seemed to us to be quite sober-minded.  We suspect that he is a reliable witness.  PD));36.74143;-95.9415162500001
