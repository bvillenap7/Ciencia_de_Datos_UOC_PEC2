Two sightings in Bartlesville, OK;2006-07-03 03:00:00;at least 1 hour;Two sightings in Bartlesville, OK Well, I had stepped outside to smoke a cigarette and looking west and upward I saw what looked like a star.  I My girlfriend comes out to stands next to me and I say   is that Venus? She doesn't know, I see that it is brighter than a normal star and flashing green, orange, and white.  I was crown shaped yet the thing changed it shape. Then to our surprise it slowly and I mean slowly moves to the right, then quickly back.  It did this several times... slow at first, then decisively going back.  Staying for 40 minutes or so we know the position has changed in the sky way to the right.  It was as high that I mistook it for a star. Seemed as if tiny white lasers were leaving it or crossing it's path.  7 months ago I was driving home at 3 pm or so northward here in town. I saw in the sky from way high several flashing white lights descend toward earth each flashed at different times yet at the same speed. They were arranged like this. Imaging an upside down pointing rack of bowling pins set them apart wider, and add two more on the top row: ((NUFORC Note:  Orientation of objects did not survive transfer to database.  PD)) Their position to each other did not change but it fell at such a high rate of speed I sped through residential streets to get to a place to catch it again.;36.74143;-95.9415162500001
