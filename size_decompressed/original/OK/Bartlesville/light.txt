3 lights over Bartlesville, OK.;2003-06-09 04:00:00;30 minutes;3 lights over Bartlesville, OK. At 4 AM I was awaken by a security alarm at the Chili's restaurant in Bartlesville, OK.  While looking outside (to see what was going on), I noticed 3 lights (NNE from my House).  Each was moving independently from each other and in very irregular directions.   I saw nothing more than points of lights.  Each faded in and out from invisible, to the brightness of a faint star, then to the brightness of Venus.  Rarely did I see all three at once.  Usually two were visible.  Sometimes only one was visible.  After the security alarm was turned off, the lights were still visible for about 5 more minutes (no sounds).  Total time was about 30 minutes.   The lights were either very far off (and moving very quickly), or very close and very small.  From my direction, they could have been over ((name deleted)) car lot (with bright lights in the parking lot).  However, I didn't get the impression it was coming from the parking lot lights.  Seemed much further away.;36.74143;-95.9415162500001
medium bright star moving south to north at great speed.;2003-08-17 21:30:00;1 minute;medium bright star moving south to north at great speed. we saw a light only about as strong as medium starlight. the object travelled south to north (slightly irratic but basically straight) the object appeared to be very high but it did not streak like a meteor. the only thing which struck me as odd was the speed at which it was moving. it tracked across the entire sky in a minute or less I had seen an aircraft moving at high altitude 30 or so miutes earlier it was flashing and more than one color... this was not flashing or twinkling just a medium bright star(in town probably much brighter out of town) it was just whitish light. we are not near any military airbase or place associated with strange objects, swamp gas, or crop circles... so a simple moving object in ther sky moving at such a speed strikes me as strange.;36.74143;-95.9415162500001
