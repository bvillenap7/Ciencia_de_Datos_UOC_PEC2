Saw 4 red orbs, that at first I thought were drones, but they move too quickly and too close together to be that.  They shot straight up and disappeared eventually.  Was in the north sky.  They made no noise.;36.74143;-95.9415162500001

As I did so, I saw a rather out of this world ship. It was unlike anything I had ever seen before. It seemed to hover for about 20-25 seconds. At one time it even moved from side to side. It did have lights, but lights that were not on earthly aircrafts...only UFO lights. As it hovered, it kind of went still for a second, and then I chose to look away...eventually looking back at where the UFO had been, but it had vanished. Simply vanished!;36.74143;-95.9415162500001
