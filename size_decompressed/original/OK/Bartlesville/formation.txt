Previously spotted same craft.((anonymous report));2017-02-16 19:48:00;30 seconds;Array of several bright white lights traveling north to south. Very large craft. Previously spotted same craft 2 weeks prior w/fireball Tonight I sighted a number of bright white lights crossing the sky moving north to south, seen on the western horizons.  These bright lights were spaced evenly at a considerable amount of distance from the next.  All seven lights moved in perfect unison and were traveling in a perfectly straight line.  This, as well as, a quiet but definite low hum that indicated an overpassing aircraft could be heard as it passed.  This hum from the craft was an echoing sound and gave the impression that this craft was very big.  Possibly 1/4 to 1/2 mile long suspecting these numerous lights made one large combined craft.  This was not the first time I have spotted this craft. About two weeks ago on this day in the same direction, traveling the same way, I and four other witnesses sighted this craft moving at a slightly faster rate.  About one hour later of that same night, in the direction of which the earlier craft had moved out of eyesight, an extremely bright and large emission of an orange fireball erupted through the sky moving horizontally in the sky north to south with an orange trail traveling behind.  The fireball dissipated within 4 seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));36.74143;-95.9415162500001
