We never saw them again after the flight South. We looked for them for another 20 minutes.  These circular lights were roughly 2000 feet off the ground. I was not quick enough to get a picture or a video of them.  I have never seen anything like this before.  This was absolutely astonishing and definitely weird.;36.8065;-98.6808
