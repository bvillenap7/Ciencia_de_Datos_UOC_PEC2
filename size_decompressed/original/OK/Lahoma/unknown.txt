Southern sky 80 degrees up, what looked like stars at first.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect stars.  PD));2015-05-02 03:00:00;2 hours;Southern sky 80 degrees up, what looked like stars at first UFO s were in southern sky at 80 degrees up.  They looked like just faint stars but clearly not as moving around erratically and sometimes multiple ones that seem to chase each other.   This was visible for almost 2 hours.  Ultimately they streaked across the sky and stopped in the now northern sky (took about 4 seconds).  After a few minutes they streaked to the northeast out of site.   These UFOs were outside the atmosphere.   I was looking to see if I could spot a satellite and realized what I thought were stationary stars were these UFOs. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect stars.
