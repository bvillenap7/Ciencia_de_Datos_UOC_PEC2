While driving to work, traveling north on highway 177, south of Perkins OK @ approximately 10:30 PM December 1, 2001. There were several bright objects with long tails which appeared low in the western sky, which was outside the drivers side pickup window.  These objects are best described as a group of slow motion shooting stars with bright tails, only closer. These, 5 to 6 objects appearing in the west, low in the horizion, was the closest distance to the observer, these objects were maintaining the same pattern as they moved from the drivers left, across the north bound path of the driver, this would be a north-easterly direction coming from the drivers left rear and crossing directly across the drivers front windshield.  The pattern and spacing of the objects were the width of a hand held @ arms length. The length of the tails or streaks of light were approximately four times the width of the pattern, or a distance of one foot @ that same arms length distance.  The initial sighting was outside the drivers door window and the objects were within this viewing window. The objects kept a low profile or low distance which could be viewed without bending down to view from inside a pickup truck. The color of the light was white. It has been learned that a satelite  re-entered the atmosphere? ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness is describing the re-entry event that occurred at approximately 2120 hrs.
