Bright Flashes of Light;2006-03-25 05:30:00;1-2 sec;Bright Flashes of Light We live 10 miles outside of town and our nearest neighbor is over a mile away. (we are way out in the country) My husband and I were in the living room drinking our morning coffee. Where he sits, he can see out the north windows and I can see out the south windows. We both saw a bright bluish light flash once and then again. My husband said, oh it's lightening, and when he opened the front door to look, the sky was clear and there was no thunder or lightening.;35.7363;-96.6707
