Two seperate phenomena occuring less then 30 seconds apart over Stillwater, OK.;2007-11-12 21:20:00;1 minute;Two seperate phenomena occuring less then 30 seconds apart over Stillwater, OK. 	I was heading east after class leaving the OSU campus when I saw two white lights slowly drifting down just above a cloud.   At first I thought it was a meteor breaking up but they were falling slowly and drifting to and from each other. The best way I can describe them is a bright center with a glow in front of them.   I eventually lost sight of them after falling behind the cloud after tracking them for about 30 seconds. 	I began running up a bit and searching for them again and eventually looked up to have something else catch my eye.  I was looking pretty much straight up and saw a group of quickly moving objects that held an incomplete V formation, 7 to 10 total  (Two on the short side the rest on the long side).  The objects looked like short dashes and were also white, the same brightness as stars.   The formation held the entire time they crossed the sky west to east which took around 15 seconds until I lost them over the horizon. 	I am not that much of a UFO enthusiast but the fact that I witnessed two separate phenomena within 30 seconds of each other irked me enough to decide that it needed reporting.  I assume that the falling lights could have been flares, but I know of nothing that can explain the V formation.;36.1138252100841;-97.0605663865545
