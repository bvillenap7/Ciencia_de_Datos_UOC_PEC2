Three of us saw a high flying jet/airplane begin zig-zagging across the sky for about 30 seconds.;1977-06-15 01:00:00;1-2 minutes;Three of us saw a high flying jet/airplane begin zig-zagging across the sky for about 30 seconds. This happened so long ago that I have never considered reporting it until I heard you on the recent sightings on radio show.  At the time I thought that ufo's had to be a flying saucer to be a real event. But some months ago, I read a recent report that sounded much like mine. I never forgot what happened but I didn't commit the entire night to memory either.  The date I gave is a pretty wild guess based on who I was with and when we would have been together. Here is what happened. My two friends and I were college friends/roomies off campus at Okla. State Univ.  It must have been early Saturday morning and we had been out chasing the ladies and the bars had closed down so we  decided to go out about 5 miles west of town to Lake Carl Blackwell where we liked to go to watch the stars for meteors.  We were just lying flat on the ground looking straight up.  I was laying with my head facing west and my feet to the east.  At some point I saw what I thought was a high flying airplane or jet (i.e. a point source of light, like a star) moving across the sky at a semmingly normal speed, from west to east. I saw it near my zenith and fixed on it for some reason. After it passed my zenith, it began zig zagging.  It was not arc-ing but was making definite hard angles. The relative distance the object moved from one cut to the next was about the size of a dime at arms lenghth. It did not speed up or slow down, it just zigged for about 30 seconds and then returned to a straight line until it passed out of sight to the east. I did not say a word and neither did my friends but about a minute after it had slowly disappeared I just asked Did anybody see that?  Both of my friends raised up and said in unison, Did you see that too?  I asked, Dale,what did YOU see? Dale described exactly what I saw.  DeWayne agreed that he saw the same thing.  We scratched our heads and then let it go. Now, we HAD been out on the town earlier but we were not intoxicated, certainly not to a point were it effected what we saw. I have never seen anything act like that before or since and spend alot of time outdoors wathing the night sky.  I've seen satellites just sort of fade in and then fade out, but never saw anything zig-zagging in or even arc-ing in any manor. I still wonder what it was.;36.1138252100841;-97.0605663865545
2 brilliant headlight shaped objects, appeared suddenly then disappeared.;2013-02-19 04:39:00;45 seconds;2 brilliant headlight shaped objects, appeared suddenly then disappeared.  Was on my refuse collection route. Pulled onto the Highway 33 from a county road. I observed no traffic from either direction before I entered the highway. 2 lights appeared from nowhere to the rear of my truck.  Could see no shape of vehicle in my mirrors ,very bright lights.  Had the shape of headlights of a car, but were gone  by the time I pulled over.;36.1138252100841;-97.0605663865545
2 or 3 small lights randomly floating around in the sky. No clear flight path at all.;2013-04-24 00:00:00;10 minutes;2 or 3 small lights randomly floating around in the sky. No clear flight path at all. 2 or 3 small red lights randomly moving around the sky.  It was not a plane because it just kept moving around, up and down, side to side for 10 mins and then it just disappeared.  There was no flight path.

Bright star dimmed then picked up speed, shot across the sky then altered direction and disappeared.;2013-05-01 03:20:00;15 seconds;Bright &quotstar&quot dimmed then picked up speed, shot across the sky then altered direction and disappeared. I was looking at a bright star above and a little to the southwest of me.  (This all happened in about 10-15 seconds) I observed the star start to dim and I first thought a cloud was covering it but it was a clear sky.   The star seemed to have disappeared, but I noticed it was still there when I saw that it started to move in a northern direction. 	The object progressively picked up speed, (~2 second duration) once it reached a speed about what a shooting star would travel it changed direction towards the western sky and disappeared.  The object didn't change directions in a 90 degree fashion but made a sharp curve.;36.1138252100841;-97.0605663865545
I saw 7 or 8 balls of white light in clear sky at 9:00 AM that were flying in non linear fashion with a strange zigzag trajectory to NE;2013-11-09 09:08:00;45 minutes;I saw 7 or 8 balls of white light in clear sky at 9:00 AM that were flying in non linear fashion with a strange zigzag trajectory to NE I noticed some bright lights in clear sky at 9:00 AM. They looked looked stars. However immediately I dismissed that assumption since first they were moving and second the sun was in the sky and no stars were visible except these moving lights.  Then I thought they might be air planes but I have seen many air planes when I look at sly everyday at high altitude.  The body of airplane is clearly visible in those cases and I can see the wings. but these were just spot lights.  With unusual bright white. I am sure they were not planes or any conventional crafts.  Moreover, they used to move not in a straight line but in a irregular shape flying NE.  They were going back and forward joyously and left and right sometimes but generally flying north east.  First I saw one and then I noticed they are three and then I spotted 7 or 8 of them.  They were flying together.  They were very far.  I changed my position to see if they change position in the sky in comparison to tree tops in the scene. but their location was unchanged in comparison to my movement indicating that those objects were really high in the sky. I tried to fit every other explanation instead of UFO such as maybe they are white birds lighted with sun in the morning. But they were not birds. I look at birds in the sky everyday (I do relaxation 1 hour a day in open field) and I can recognize their body, wings etc. Moreover birds fly in a direction not such a zigzag pattern back and forward, sudden 90 degrees turn, such as these objects. Then I tried to see them as papers or objects taken by wind to high altitude but the way they moved was inconsistent with objects who are blown by winds. They did not swirled like the wind rotate the object. They suddenly changed their direction a few times with right angle turns within 5 seconds. It was obvious someone is controlling that craft or light bulb. I am a mechanical engineer, PhD, and I know a little about craft movement types. These obj! ects (lights) were not moving like a regular craft such as we ! have. I have never seen an object moving in sly like that. Their light was sometimes changing form white to light pink and then again to white. I am a very skeptic person and I tried so hard to convince myself they are not UFOs. However, I have to admit that what I saw does not fit any other possible explanation (They could not be birds, wind blown objects, planes, etc.) other than UFO.;36.1138252100841;-97.0605663865545
