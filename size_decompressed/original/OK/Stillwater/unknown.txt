I called the airport but was laughed at and I but it out of my mind for a number of years until 1995 when I finaly went to the police, I was interviewed by the Lt. as well as some one from your office.. I believe this was before you came to take over. Any way.. to stream line this.. it was a black object with a big red light on top that went slowly on and off while it moved.. when hovering it would cease all together and rotate a black and white checker board center while tilting left and right.. then it would level out and stop rotating the center and the red light would come on again. It did this for a long time.. this even has traumatized me and my mother for years. My mother is very religious.. she saw it first. My dad is retired Military but he wasn't home.. anyway I can draw images and maps if you are more intersted with this.. you may still have the recording from 1995. The guy said it was to old for a report.. but it is NOT in my mind.. it is burned in memory and I relive it alot.. I gues I have post traumatic stress from this.;36.1138252100841;-97.0605663865545
