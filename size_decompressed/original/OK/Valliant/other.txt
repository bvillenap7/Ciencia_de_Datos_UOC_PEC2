I just read the sighting at http://www.rense.com/general42/tan.htm. The bright shiny object is what I saw as I came into Valliant OK (Valiant is about 20-25 miles from Hugo.). It was almost, if not still. I spotted it just as I made the city limits. I tried to find a place to park where I could see the object and at the same time fumbled with my Mavica. I parked on the north side of Hwy 70, by the bank. As the camera booted up the object started to fade. It faded out of sight over about 30 seconds. I thought it might have been an airplane, but I could not see anything after it faded. As I try to figure the angle that I was looking at, the best way for me to tell you is that if 9:00 is straight forward and 12:00 it straight up then the object was at about 10:30. That would be about 50 or so degrees would it not? Then over about 12 or 15 degrees to the north, just over the top of the first building going down the business district. I have no way to judge the distance, or height, but it was about a .25 inch at arms length, and very, very bright. I know this is not much of a sighting, but after I read the story about the Hugo sighting the next day, I thought I should drop you a line. You be the judge.;34.0091;-95.0686
