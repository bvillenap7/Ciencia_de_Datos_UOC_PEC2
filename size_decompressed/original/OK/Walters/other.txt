Bright yellow, flowy UFO sighted in Walters, Oklahoma by working mother.;2010-08-05 00:00:00;approx. 30 seconds;Bright yellow, flowy UFO sighted in Walters, Oklahoma by working mother. I was driving home from work, eastbound towards Temple, OK.  I noticed overhead an object at about my 11 o clock position .  In shape it was somewhat like a spade from a deck of cards but less round.  The first thing to come to mind was a phoenix, it was glowing very bright yellow and was flowy like feathers.  It was relatively small about 5 feet wide and 3 feet long.  It remained in that spot in my line of sight for a few seconds, then it simply vanished after turning pale in color, almost white.   After that happened for the rest of the way home,(just about 3.5 more miles), in the sky there were what appeared to be shooting stars going different random directions through the sky.  I saw approx. 10 of these before they stopped completely.  This experience was the first I've had in Oklahoma since my son and my fiance moved here from Maryland about 5 months ago.  Back in Maryland my fiance and I had separate sightings.  I strongly believe in intelligent life outside of our planet and what I saw tonight backs up my beliefs.;34.3594;-98.3174
