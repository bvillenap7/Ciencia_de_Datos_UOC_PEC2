3 bright lights hovering with colored aura moving back and forth and up and down one landed.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus??));2004-02-14 19:30:00;2 hours;3 bright lights hovering with colored aura moving back and forth and up and down one landed. we saw a very bright light in the southwest sky that seemed to be hovering at a low altitude as we began to look around we saw two more one to the east and the other to the west we got our binoculars out to get a better look at what they might be, we looked at the one that seemed to be somewhat lower than the other two which was the one in the southwest, we saw a saucer shaped object it was very large the object seemed to have very bright lights in quarter sections around it had a glow of lights that were fire red, purple, orange and a light green color as we looked at the other two they were the same but smaller. the one in the southwest was lowering itself slowly to the ground as it did it turned triangular shaped and all we could see was a fire red color with clear a bright light glowing around it. It went down into the side of a mountain.then we started looking at the other two they would move back and forth and up and down then they just disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous.  We suspect the witnesses were looking at the planet Venus, which is currently in the southwest sky, but we received independent reports from other locations in Oklahoma for this date, so we are uncertain.
