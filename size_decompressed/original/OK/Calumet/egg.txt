Egg shaped Orb west of Okc;2011-02-12 06:00:00;1 hr;Egg shaped Orb west of Okc After getting off of work i noticed a ball of light at a considerably low altitude.  When i proceeded on my way home the light seemed to be traveling at a similar rate of speed.  On two separate instances the light went from the passenger side to driver side view instantaneously.  Towards the end of my drive two fighter jets raced toward it and did two separate flybys.  When this occured i decided to stop and take a picture, revealing an egg shaped ball of light. Incredibly i have seen the object two days in a row now.  On day two there was five different jets investigating this object in the sky.  It wasn't a star, plane, or helicopter.  It changed altitudes and moved horizontally for several miles.;35.5476;-98.1549
