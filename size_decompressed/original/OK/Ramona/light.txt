Stepped onto the porch, when I noticed a rather intense light display on the northern horizon. Three amber colored lights, each of them star-shaped, hung just above the tree tops. This was along the edge of the property line, which adjoined the empty lot.  Of the three lights, the star in the center appeared as if it were brighter, if not larger, than its companions to the left and right. Orange, gold, yellow, the lights shimmered in the breeze. Although, they didnâ€™t appear to sway in the wind, which was considerably less than it had been earlier, when it was gusty. The sky was mostly clear.;36.577;-95.8997
