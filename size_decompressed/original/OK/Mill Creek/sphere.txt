The Silent Amber Sphere;2020-05-01 00:04:00;25 seconds;The Silent Amber Sphere It was an odd time for the songbirds to be singing.  The dogs and coyotes joined in on the chorus with their barking and howling. I stood out in my backyard and gazed up at the stars.  For a good 20 minutes, I watched the beautiful night sky and absorbed the sounds of nature around me . And that is when it happened.  What appeared to be a short distance from me in my pasture, a beautiful spherical light that was amber in color arose into the night.  I would equate it to a small sun silently rising up and moving westward.  It was so close, maybe a few hundred feet in elevation.  The brilliant light dissipated into the night sky the further it moved away from me.  I wasn’t afraid. I was in absolute awe of its beauty. I calmly came inside to fetch my niece, hoping she might witness such a serene event.  As we walked out into the yard, I pointed in the vicinity of where it had faded away.  Just a mere minutes of telling her, the same beautiful amber sphere lit up again (as if to acknowledge us acknowledging it).  Had it been cloaked? Whatever it was, it was beautiful.  I’m glad we both got to witness it.;34.3105;-96.7932
