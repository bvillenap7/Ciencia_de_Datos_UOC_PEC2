They stayed motionless from my perspective in the car for at least the fifteen minute drive to my home. I could not see them from my home I grabbed my wife and we drove back onto the road and west toward Indianola to where we could see them and parked the car off the road and watched them. The lights stayed in the same position. They looked to be to the west/southwest (between 255 and 270 degrees). We looked through a pair of binoculars (5x30 Bushnell) and it appeared there were colored lights around the objects.  As we started to check the lights out a general aviation plane flew between our position and the lights and it appeared to be at about 5,000 (I'm a student pilot). He could have seen them. Then cloud cover came in and it was hard to tell if they were dimming or not.  Then clouds covered them up. We ended trying to see more. With no movement like that I suppose they may have been two stars, but they seemed far to bright for that and I've never seen stars in that position with that level of brilliance ever before.;35.1296;-95.8143
