UFO caught on videotape in Eastern Oklahoma.;2000-03-06 22:00:00;6 minutes;UFO caught on videotape in Eastern Oklahoma. I am a freelance videographer, late Feb.'00, I purchased a new DVCPRO digital cam. and on this particular early March night we had an extremely large, orange full moon, so I wanted to see how this camera operated at night and I locked-down a shot of the moon and walked away. When I thought the moon had traveled through my shot, I went to look in the viewfinder and it was completely black, but then I noticed a quick, little white spark or flash. I kept observing this flash and can be heard on the camera's mic saying something is wrong with my camera. Later I put the footage in my editor, slowed it down and realized this spark was dancing all over the screen and in a few places can see more than one flash and with some enhancements can even see a rotation around these objects. One freeze frame shows the perfect shape of a saucer with blue and green haze. I have never been into UFO's or such, but I still wonder now, like my two buddies also who were there, exactly what this could have been?;35.4538;-94.5291
