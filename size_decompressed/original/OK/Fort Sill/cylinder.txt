can shaped object over FT Sill OK;1998-08-01 14:00:00;4 to 5 min;can shaped object over FT Sill OK I was at the 50cal range on FT Sill during basic training. A friend of mine pointed out a object in the sky.  the sky was clear and blue no clouds.  i saw a small can shaped object, way up.  it moved verry slowly in a up direction, not like north but up away from the ground. it was a bright silver color, made no noise. it was visible for about 4 min, i had trouble finding it again if i took my eyes off it. i watched it as long as i was allowed by the drill seargents.  i have never seen anything like this.;34.6599;-98.4035
