Hug Black Triangle Object, seen by at least 30 people !;2004-11-15 23:40:00;3 minutes;Hug Black Triangle Object, seen by at least 30 people ! This incident has been on my mind for sometime now.  And I share this with several people in private.  I cannot quite remember if it was in late 2004 or 2005.  But I know it was before I had my car accident in May of 2005.  It was before midnight.   At the time, I was working for the public transportation.  It was on the weekend,  I can't remember if it was Friday or Saturday.  We had to pick up Marines to get them back to there barracks before midnight for formation.  I had about 5 people in the vehicle and several other vehicles also were there or came in after me, to drop off all those Marines.   I stepped out of the vehicle when I noticed this big football size or bigger triangle shaped object come from the east and fly over the Marine barracks very very low and slow.  You could not hear a sound from the object.  Many of the other people that were there also seen this object.  But everyone was so busy to get into the formation.  The object was all black, there was no lights showing.  It flew slowly over the building and while flying over the building, it leaned to the left.  And it flew from the east torwards southwest.  If I would have stood on top of the building and reached out my arm, I probably could have touched the object.  This is how low the object was.  This object was massive.  And you could see lines on the object, as if it was carved into it.   I know it has been 11 or 12 years since this happen and I been worried of sharing this with the public, because it has happen on a Military Base.. But I thought it is time to share this incident anyways.;34.6599;-98.4035
