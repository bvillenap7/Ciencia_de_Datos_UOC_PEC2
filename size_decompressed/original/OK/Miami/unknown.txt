As I was sitting there something in the sky caught my eye.  I assumed at first that it was a plane but was way too shiny and reflective and hovering.  There were some light clouds but the object was far below them.  I tried to determine a shape which I never figured out but it was too compact to be an airplane. What intrigued me was how shiny it was. As I was watching it, it just disappeared, no movement what so ever, just gone.;36.8796;-94.8649
Three unidentified illuminations east of Miami, Ok.;2014-07-03 23:00:00;10 minutes;Three unidentified illuminations east of Miami, Ok. It was late and we were sitting on the back porch before going to bed.  I noticed three separate illuminations and first mentioned to my Father that someone had launched three Chinese lanterns.  I did not think much of it, until I noticed that the lights were not changing in altitude or velocity, but  remained still.  We then began watching closer.   The lights were orange and appeared to be separated at equal distance, away from our location.  The lights were far away and we could not make any other observations about the source.  The lights appeared to be moving together away from our location and eventually were not visible.  It was strange to me that the lights never increased in elevation, but remained in a consistent formation as it slowly moved to the east away from Miami.;36.8796;-94.8649
