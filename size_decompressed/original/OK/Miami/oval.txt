Flock of Silver Ovalish Shaped Disk flying quickly through the daytime sky.;1999-10-12 09:00:00;2 Minutes;Flock of Silver Ovalish Shaped Disk flying quickly through the daytime sky. My sister and I  were either driving to or from morningtime church  in 1999 and we were near NEO A&M College on Central Street in Miami, OK.  Then, suddenly, we saw at least 12-15  silver roundish (more like eyeball) shaped disk flying quickly through the air in some sort of diamond formation.  They had no lights or glowing and they were pretty far away in the sky. We pulled over in my truck near the  NEO walking track to watch them and suddenly they disappeared.  It only lasted a few short minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));36.8796;-94.8649
