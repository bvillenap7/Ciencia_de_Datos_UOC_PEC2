Black Diamond shape object over Miami, Oklahoma;2007-12-20 17:00:00;5 minutes;Black Diamond shape object over Miami, Oklahoma I was driving down the highway and I happened to look up and I saw this object in the sky.  It was shaped like a diamond, black in color and seem to just be hovering.  I kept looking away and then back as if to make sure I was really seeing it.  After a few minutes in the time it took to blink it was gone.;36.8796;-94.8649
