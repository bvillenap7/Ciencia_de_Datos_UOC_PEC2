I continued looking at it and it started getting smaller until it completely disappeared.  I now think it was moving away and getting smaller. I've seen some strange things in this area of NE Oklahoma,but this is the only one that I haven't been able to rationalize. Thanks for your super site! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  We wonder whether she might have been witness to a satellite, perhaps the International Space Station, which is quite bright in a clear sky.  When a satellite flies into the shadow of the Earth, it dims, which leaves a witness on the ground with the impression that the object had diminished in size, and therefore, streaked away from the witness.

UFO MISSOURI INVESTIGATOR GROUP REPORT:  I looked out the window of our pick-up and noticed a large orange star or so I thoughtâ€¦;2005-12-28 21:00:00;5 minutes;I looked out the window of our pick-up and noticed a large orange star or so I thought... I'm guessing the last Wednesday night of December, the 28th, or the first Wednesday, January 4th, about 9:00 pm, I was returning home with my 29 year old daughter after picking her up from church.  I looked out the window of our pick-up and noticed a large orange star or so I thought.   I said Look how orange that star is, I'm going to stop and check it out.  I was just looking at it with my window down at this point, then it started to move.   It was in the northwest sky and traveled a little south, then stopped, moved again south a little farther, and stopped again.  It just stayed there then moved once again,  I told my daughter I was going to follow it because it was moving again.  I was going down a street and I blinked the my lights several times rapidly and the object stopped.  I think that was just coincidence though.  I had to turn by that time to go around the block and when I looked for it, it was just gone!    This all happened faster than the telling.  It also moved rather quickly.  It didn't actually twinkle or blink but I got the impression of something swirling around it like air maybe.   When I got home I asked my husband if there is any standard aircraft that would behave like this did. He said not that he's aware of. I told a woman I work with about the incident and she said her daughter seen an orange object once also. Report taken by the Missouri Investigators Group - B.
