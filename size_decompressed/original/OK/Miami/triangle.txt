Maybe 8 stories above my car hovering made more of blowing noise than propeller noise. Slowly began to move and ascend. Chased for about 15 min as it changed directions 3 times and each time it turned it stayed perfectly level. No roll or wide turn like an airplane. Have photo. I'm convinced this was a ufo as I'm familiar with aviation and modern aircrafts and have tried to think of other explanations but cannot. After about watching it head west where I couldnt follow I snapped a pic. About 5 min later an airplane coming from another direction passed and I could hear the propellers I snapped a picture of the airplane and have tried comparing the 2 photos to see a difference in the lights and color.;36.8796;-94.8649
