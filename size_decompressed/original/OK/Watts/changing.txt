It was facing towards siloam springs.  The object seemed to move up a bit but at a slow pace.  Within a few minutes the object turned from a ball of light into a long orange shape.  Then it changed from one object into two.  Then back into one, changing back into itâ€™s original color and shape.  It started to become smaller and dimmer and then eventually disappeared.;36.1176;-94.6325
