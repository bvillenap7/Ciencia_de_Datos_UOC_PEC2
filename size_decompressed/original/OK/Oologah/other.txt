UFO that was silent and very large in Northeastern Oklahoma;2003-10-01 21:30:00;5-10 minutes;UFO that was silent and very large in Northeastern Oklahoma We saw a bright light that was real low in the sky and it was too low to be an aircraft coming in for a landing. The light was really bright.  We stopped the car and I got out and watched it.  It flew right over the top of us.  It was the strangest thing I have ever experienced.  The aircraft was huge, larger than a 3 bedroom house that is 900 sq. ft.. As I looked up at it I wasn't able to make out a definite shape. It had a light on each side and one in the middle. The one in the middle was red. I worked for an airline and have had many planes fly close to me and this wasn't like any commercial airliners.  The light sequence wasn't the same and the shape that I could make out wasn't like anything I have seen or studied.  The most important thing is that it was completely silent and it was only about 80-100 feet above me. It was going fairly slow and at time seemed to stop and then after it had passed overhead and went about a quarter mile it picked up speed and then disappeared.;36.4507;-95.7138
Diamond shape with swinging projection underneath, flashing lights and sporadic movement;2019-07-31 22:25:00;7 minutes;Diamond shape with swinging projection underneath, flashing lights and sporadic movement The object seamed to have a diamond shape with a projection on the bottom that seemed to sway.  It move  sporadically and the project had at least two lights that flashed every few seconds.  It  seem to stop, and hover in one place, before lowering behind the treelike.  As it was receding, I managed to look at it in a telescope and it was bright enough to make out the diamond shape and projection with lights.  Once it stopped moving sporadically, the swing of the projection stopped as well. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));36.4507;-95.7138
