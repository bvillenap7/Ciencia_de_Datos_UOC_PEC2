Bright Orange Light or orb;2011-07-02 21:00:00;3 minutes;We were outside getting ready to shoot fireworks.  It was still a little daylight. My son noticed a really bright orange light or orb off in the distance. He thought that was odd. Kept watching it.  Wondered what it was.  It was really bright.  He pointed it out to others outside but they were too busy talking to pay attention. He thought at first it was an airplane but the closer it got he saw it was not an airplane.  He is an A & P mechanic so he knows what an airplane looks like.  It Came from the East & went West past us. It kept going in a straight line flying like an airplane.  It kept the same altitude. It made no sound.  It had no other lights on it, only the bright orange light.  It flew slowly by. Was about 3,000 ft. up in sky.  After it went over it slowly faded out & disappeared.  It left you wondering what the heck did I just see.  He lives off Hwy. 169.;36.4507;-95.7138
