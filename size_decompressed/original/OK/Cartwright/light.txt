Lights over Lake Texhoma.;2006-05-01 21:00:00;20 min.;Lights over Lake Texhoma. Sighted over Lake Texhoma.  Lights were pink, blue and silver.  Craft hovered and moved and then returned.  Sighting lasted approx. 20 minutes and then disappeared. At first I thought it was a plane, but it couldn't have been because of actions.  First time I had seen anything like this.  Thanks. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the witness alludes to a nighttime event.  We have altered the time above.  PD));33.8633;-96.5649
