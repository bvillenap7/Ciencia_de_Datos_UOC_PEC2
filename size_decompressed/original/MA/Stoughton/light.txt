((HOAX??)) I saw four lights in the sky in a straight angled line. All difrent colors.  I have pictures. ((anonymous report));2016-08-14 21:30:00;>2 hours;I saw four lights in the sky in a straight angled line.  All different colors.  I have pictures and had them shown to my friends.   Later on, about a half hour later, my friend came over saw exactly what I saw.  The only new thing was a loud thumping noise coming in that direction.   There was no movement from it.  This was all observed after losing power from a storm.  This could not be lighting or static due to them all being different colors.   Through the enitre time, my dog was extremely restless.  These did not leave until after power was return 2 hours later.   After we went inside, the clocks where either wrong or the events happend much much quicker.   Althought the videotape claims the video is 2 hours long. ((NUFORC Note:  Anonymous report no contact information.  Possible hoax??  PD));42.1246000000001;-71.1149
