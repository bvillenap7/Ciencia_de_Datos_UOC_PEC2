We where playing in the snow in front of my friends house when I looked up and saw what at 1st look like a half moon in color and size.  But then a double take freeked me and my friend out.. this thing was moving rather quick with no sound from south to north sky...  I ran home and asked my mom to call the AirForce to tell them what I just saw...  It took about 15 min to convince my mom to call, but she did and reported my sighting.  The Air Force said It could have been a weather baloon...  But, to this day I dont think it was a weather baloon.  Has any other reports been submited like this one??
