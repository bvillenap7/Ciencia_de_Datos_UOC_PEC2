I was lying in bed around 1 AM when I felt like something was happening.  I didn't really know what, but I could feel it.  I looked out of my window and I saw an orange circle behind some trees, up in the air.  I thought it was the moon at first but I dismissed that after I realized the moon wasn't that big, orange, and doesn't stay in place.   It was a circular shape, and it looked like it was literally on fire.  It didn't do anything except stay (Hover?) in place.  This lasted for about three hours.  It is now 4 AM, and I looked out the window again and it was gone.;42.1246000000001;-71.1149
