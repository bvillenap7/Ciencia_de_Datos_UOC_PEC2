UFO dropped from the sky at high rate of speed.;2003-11-29 22:00:00;18 seconds;UFO dropped from the sky at high rate of speed. Driving back from a Thanksgiving party my girlfriend and I both noticed something strange. A light (circle) with one pulsating light in the middle (yellow) hovered in the sky for aprox eight seconds before dropping at a high rate of speed. Nor her or I have seen a plane that looks quite like that. Nor have we seen anything drop straight towards the ground at that speed. It dropped for about two seconds before it was out of sight. In those two seconds it covered the entire sky. We both know what planes look like and how they run, as we live near Boston (logan airport) This was not a plane. It happened somewhat near the Hockomock Swamp (the bridgewater triangle)  Shortly after, a millitary style plane came acorss the area at a high rate of speed.
