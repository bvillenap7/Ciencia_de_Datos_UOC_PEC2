Steady white light blinking green and red light;2015-09-10 22:00:00;hours;steady white light blinking green and red light I live 8 miles north of Boston in Lynn Mass.  During the summer just after sunset go up about 70-80 degrees facing west there is an object with a steady white light and blinking red and green light it stays stationary for about a few hours and it slowly moves northwest and seems to get lower in the sky.  I am on a flight path and this object is higher than the planes that are landing I’m guessing but I’d say it is 20 to 30 thousand feet up pure guess.   The only thing I could think of is a blimp that is monitoring something.  It was out there most of the summer.;42.4751481012658;-70.9582189873418
