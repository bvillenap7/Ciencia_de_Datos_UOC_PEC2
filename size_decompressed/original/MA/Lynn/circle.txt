Red light over Lynn, MA.;2007-04-01 23:00:00;15 minutes;Red light over Lynn, MA. Solid light very high in sky. Then dissappeared. Bright red light. Moving very slowly across the sky. Steady light, not a blinking light. Object stopped moving and was still for a minimum of 5 minutes. Then dissappeared. We were able to get photos of the object, but was very far away and we were not able to distinguish details of the object like size or shape... We have seen a few helicoptors circling the area after the object dissappeared. No real indicators of a normal aircraft like noise, blinking lights, trails, or a change in orientation of the light.

I saw a ball of light just sitting in mid-air about a thousand feet. As soon as I said what the heck was that it turned a bit towards me and got very bright within the next 5 to 10 seconds it flew straight up at lightning speed.  It flew up so fast it almost looked like it was stretching then disappeared.  This took place in Lynn, Massachusetts year 2012 or 2013.
