Cigar shape flying south to north with at dusk with NO LIGHTS;2010-07-19 08:00:00;15 Seconds;Cigar shape flying south to north with at dusk with NO LIGHTS It was dusk, and I was sitting on my porch smoking a cigar, facing west, watching the planes come in. (All planes lights are visible at this time). As I'm sitting there, I see something light up really bright for about 1 second which draws my attention, the light goes out, and the black object continues to fly across the sky with NO LIGHTS (which is the only reason I don't think it was a plane.) I could see it clearly because it was still partially light out. It was flying south to north, which most planes don't, but did sound like a plane.;42.4751481012658;-70.9582189873418
