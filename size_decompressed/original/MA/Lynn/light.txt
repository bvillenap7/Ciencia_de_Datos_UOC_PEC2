Fast moving light vanishes from sight;2004-05-27 22:20:00;3-5 minutes;Fast moving light vanishes from sight As my boyfriend and I were standing outside my house in my back yard he looked up and noticed a fast moving white light in the sky.  We watched it as it moved across the sky and then it suddenly faded away.  My boyfriend noted that it was as if the object moved up away from the Earth and out into space.;42.4751481012658;-70.9582189873418

Very low very bright amber/red ball of light up close and personal sighting.;2014-08-29 21:05:00;8 minutes;Very low very bright amber/red ball of light up close and personal sighting. On Friday August 29th at 9pm I was watching a movie in my house and waiting for my girlfriend to get home from work soon.  During a commercial break i went out to smoke a cigarette on my front porch, after about three or four puffs, a moving, very bright amber light behind trees caught my attention.  These trees are a small woodsy area about a football field or less away from where I was standing.  This small patch of woods is on a small hill and is in between my neiborhood and the next neiborhood over, and basically separates the backyards of thehouses.                                                                                                             The amber light first caught my eye as I saw it through the gaps in the trees moving very slowly upward, it was very bright and then it rose above the tree line and was a very bright ball of amber/red light with a pulsing energy field around it, that was translucent and moving around the ball of light. My! adrenaline started pumping once it cleared the tree line because this u.f.o was up close and personal and was less than 300 feet from me, very low and about the size of a big beach ball or yoga ball and was perfectly circular including the energy ring around it. The amber ball of light began to turn red and slowly rose 15 feet above the trees, stopped and hovered completely still for about 2-3 min changing color back and  forth from amber to red I watched the ball of light in complete shock this was basically 30-50 feet above houses across the street but everyone was inside except me. The ball of light was competly silent and after hovering for 3min started to move slowly toward me and once it was on opossite side of the trees it dropped 10 feet lower and started floating left toward a tree on my street then stayed still again, I turned around and ran inside to get my phone to get a video of it and when I came out it was slowly floating behind the tree and the light started to get smaller and the ball of light vanished behind the tre! e on my street while it was only 15 feet off the ground.  I ran over to the tree to see if something fell on the ground or was still there but there was nothing anywhere.  I called my girl friend after I calmed down and she was on the highway on her way home I told her what happened and as I explained it to her planes and helicopters started circling my neiborhood one after another and when my girlfriend was coming down the highway about five min from home she counted 12 airplanes and helicopters flying low above our area, they all had bright lights on them so were clear to see at night especially so low and so many. They circled the area until 2am.  Most profound moment of my life by far, what I saw that day will be forever with me.;42.4751481012658;-70.9582189873418
Light with flashing green and red light sits in night sky for hours, then moves northward.;2015-09-12 19:00:00;4 hours;Light with flashing green and red light sits in night sky for hours, then moves northward. There is a white light and it has a flashing green and red light with it (similar to airplanes). The steady white light stays for hours and then slowly moves it way north and lower in the sky.  This object has been out for the last few weeks.  Just after sunset ( right above where the sun sets) if 90 degrees is straight up then this would be about 60 degrees in the western sky  after a while it moves northward barely moving at all.  My question is what could it be? It is not a planet nor star and not a plane actually planes are much lower in the sky I live about 8 miles north of Boston on the coast and some time the flight path is over my house.  My best guess is it appears to be about 30-40 thousand feet in the air.  What could it be?  Any guesses?;42.4751481012658;-70.9582189873418
