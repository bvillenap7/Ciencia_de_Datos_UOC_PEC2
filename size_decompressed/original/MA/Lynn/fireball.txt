So my best friend lives near the woods we were in the back yard smoking marijuana drinking some beers just relaxing and shit. i happened to take a hit and exhale as i did i happened to look up at the sky seen 2 sphere balls of fire they looked as if they were still not moving then 1 moved further then the other 1 about 200 ft then they both just faded into the sky but fast n together in formation we couldnt understand it but it made every hair in my body stand. they moved so fast and it was a ball of fire not a meteor or a star our government is telling us lies what do they want from us and are we in danger?
