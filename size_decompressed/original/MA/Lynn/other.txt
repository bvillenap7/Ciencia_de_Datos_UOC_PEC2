Rotating figure 8 slowly flying up the north coast of the greater Boston area;2020-07-28 19:50:00;2 minutes;Rotating figure 8 slowly flying up the north coast of the greater Boston area On the coast (directly on the beach) just north of Boston, a large object was observed hovering over the water just north of Nahant, and flying up the coast slowly. The object appeared to be made out of two discs/saucers that were attached to one another.  The two discs were overlapping with one another slightly, and looked almost as if they were on a different “level” from one another.  It looked like a big figure eight, with the two circles of the 8 slightly overlapped where connected in the middle. Like a Venn diagram, but the overlap was only slight.  The entire object was rotating in several ways, horizontally and vertically, almost spherically rotating. Each disc had lights completely around the edge of it.  The rotations made the lights appear to flash each time it rotated, but I don’t think it was actually flashing.  It was hovering and moving away quite slowly, heading north up the coast away from Boston as it continued to rotate.  It was about the same height as the planes that fly low here are (very close to Boston’s Logan airport).  It was about the same size too. It was low, and very large. It was dark in color, probably black.  Observed for about 2 minutes.  For background, the observer is a 33 year old woman with a masters in sociology who works as a global marketing consultant.;42.4751481012658;-70.9582189873418
