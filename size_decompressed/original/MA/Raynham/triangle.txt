((anonymous report));2019-09-14 17:00:00;7 minutes;Daylight on route 44 Raynham, black low flying object.  Flying in a sort of way a boomerang would. However it looked like backwards number 7, three of them in a triangular shape.  Flying at a steady pase.  Couldnâ€™t have been a drone because it went to far beyond what someone could control by hand controller.  Spinning fast and steady.  We have video.;41.9325;-71.048
