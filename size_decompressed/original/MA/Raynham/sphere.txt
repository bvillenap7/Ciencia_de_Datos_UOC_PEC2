Orange-yellow sphere (fire-like), travelling fast, changed direction;2012-05-12 09:44:00;2 minutes;orange-yellow sphere (fire-like), travelling fast, changed direction As I headed eastward on 495, approximately 9:44 pm, roughly exit 8 (Raynham?) on 05/12/2012, I saw a glowing orange-yellow sphere travelling north across both lanes of the highway I estimate it was 1500-4000’ in the air, flying at the speed of a jet aircraft, travelling north.  As it crossed over the eastbound lanes of 495, it changed its courseand also increased its speed, and started heading west, alongside the highway. This object was definitely not an airplane or helicopter of any sort (I fly in small planes frequently), and appeared to be glowing orange-yellow my initial description to my friend on the phone was “fireball&quot, but as it flew over, I was directly under it, it didn't appear to be on fire so much as glowing.  It could have possibly been a large hot air balloon, except it changed course very quickly, and also sped up, which seems unlikely.  It also maintained altitude for the 1 minute or so that I saw it.  THere were many other cars on the highway at this point, so I suspect other people should have seen this too. In the minutes before I saw this object, I saw a meteor fall in the area just after I saw the object, I saw another meteor.;41.9325;-71.048
