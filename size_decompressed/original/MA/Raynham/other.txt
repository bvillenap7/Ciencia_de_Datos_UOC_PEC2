Low flying object with three lights flies very quickly over houseno noise.;2004-08-31 07:30:00;2 minutes;Low flying object with three lights flies very quickly over houseno noise. I do not remember completely as this was last year( I did not hear about this site until this day) but my brother and I were just leaving someone's house. We were waiting outside and I looked up at the sky because I was bored. It was night time and I saw this  low flying craft(about 500m) with 3 lights on it flying over us. Instinctively we thought it was a plane but it did not make ANY noise.None at all. It was going a steady speed over the house,sort of fast. It was very strange because usually blimps are much larger and planes make alot of noise so it could not have been either. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

The dots slowly spread apart as they moved out of sight, but were still in a line. This was seen at Lake Nippenicket which is a part of the Bridgewater Triangle.
