spotted horizontally traversing circular/spherical object;1997-03-16 17:39:00;5 seconds;spotted horizontally traversing circular/spherical object looking out a window in the late afternoon towards southeast, clear weather, espied a tennis-ball-like (without the seams)object, pale ivory with pink/tan edges, no lights, no trailings, no markings, 30 degrees up from the horizon, traveling at a constant speed, faster than a jet plane, slower than a shooting star. It traversed from southwest to east on a dead horizontal path between trees, in a brief window of 20 to 30 degrees of horizontal observation, disappeared behind some trees.  Appeared to be 2/3 to 1/4 size of the full lunar disk. With a ruler 12 in front of my face, the disk measured roughly 3/16 to 1/4.
