Saw 6 or 7 light orange orbs hanging in the air over the water in Onset or Buzzards Bay.  Just like the airplanes at night kind of hanging in the air, waiting their turn to land at LAX (Los Angeles ).   We have never seen anything like this and drove immediately to the pier in Onset to see them.  They were gone within the 3 or 4 minutes that it took for us to get to the pier.;41.7477;-70.6533
