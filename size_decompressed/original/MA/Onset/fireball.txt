15-20 oranges lights in formation move across sky in Onset, MA;2011-07-16 21:45:00;20 minutes;15-20 oranges lights in formation move across sky in Onset, MA On the night of Saturday July 16, 2011, at approximatley 9:45 myself, my husband and my father were sitting out by the fire in an open field looking up at the sky when we saw a cluster of 3 evenly spaced orange lights moving from west to east in the sky.  Then a short distance behind them another cluster of 3 evenly spaced lights following the exact same route across the sky. After the second cluster of 3 they came in single formation evenly spaced.  About 15 single spaced lights followed the two clusters of 3.   Once they got to a certain point they faded out.  We assumed they must have turned so their lights were no longer visible to us.  We thought they must be helicopters. We turned off the radio and sat their quitely but could not hear any sound at all.  My husband took a couple photos and a short video on our digital camera.  When you zoom in on the photo they look like perfectly round glowing orbs. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));41.7477;-70.6533
