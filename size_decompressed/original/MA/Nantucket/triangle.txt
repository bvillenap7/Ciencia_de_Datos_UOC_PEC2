After I took the picture, I zoomed in and could see the UFO to the top left.  When I took the picture with my iPhone 6,  I had it on live photo.  So when you press and hold the picture it moves for about a second.  So I pressed the picture and held it and could see the UFO move and disappear.  So I blew the picture up three times and could see the UFO.;41.2727;-70.0971
