I was lying down on the beach looking up in the sky. I was watching high altitude aircraft flying over from south to northeast. they were taking a sharp turn to the north. On the left of the contrails as they  turned to the the north there was a round shiny object just sitting there. Told all my friends about it and they saw it to. we all said maybe it's a bright star. I was watching it and it didn't move at all. I said, well i guess it may be a star. What i realy thought, was , this looks kinda funny. Then i figured, well it's starting to get alittle dark out It should still be there if it was a star. Min. later, I looked up, (on a clear night) and it was'nt there. MMM pritty stange to me.
