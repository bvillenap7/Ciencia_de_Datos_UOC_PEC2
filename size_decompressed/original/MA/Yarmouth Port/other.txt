Approached 3 of us on verandah were 3 white lighted objects (thought were falling stars at first) approached in perfect synchronization from the south.  All 3 stopped overhead abruptly and hovered.   Then 1 shot off northwest.  The other 2 hovered for a moment longer and then in perfect synchronization shot off in precise opposite directions and disappeared one east, one west. 3 of us sitting on veranda to watch in astonishment.  Mentionable: we are close to airplane directional beacon (I think it's called that.)   The night was very dark.  There was some light pollution and yet these 3 stood out in amazement and awe.;41.7083;-70.2239
