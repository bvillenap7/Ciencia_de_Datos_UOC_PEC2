Three strobe like flashes at 3:44 am, no sounds.;2012-03-14 03:44:00;seconds;Three strobe like flashes at 3:44 am, no sounds. At 3:44 am I saw three flashes of light outside of my window.  The first two flashes were right on top of each other, the last flash was just a second later.    I went to the window to see what was causing the flashes as they were not like heat lightning and the sky was clear.   They were intense strobe like flashes.   There were no airplanes in the sky and no airplane noises.   When I mentioned this to my friend on the phone this afternoon, she said the exact same thing happened to her in Dennis at exactly the same time of morning.   We both felt very groggy and didn't think to stay awake to  look for more lights, but went back to bed instead.;41.7083;-70.2239
