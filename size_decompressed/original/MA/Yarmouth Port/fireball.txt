Driving west down 6A in Yarmouth Port, just before the green, I saw one, then two, fireball objects in the sky in front of us.   I shouted, What is that? He said, A plane. I said, That's no plane I've ever seen.  He said, Look, there's a third one!   I turned down a side street so we would be driving but they disappeared into the clouds.;41.7083;-70.2239
