Oval white blue light moving fast with no sound (second in the last week);2010-11-02 07:20:00;5 seconds;Oval white blue light moving fast with no sound (second in the last week) The first sighting was 10/28/2010 my wife woke up @ 2am and saw a massive bright light lit the valley between the mountains across the street, she said it was huge and then suddenly shrunk and and disappeared.  Then tonight we were bring the dog out before a movie and as we were walking in I noticed white blueish oval moving at a high rate of speed.  I said hunny do you see that she looked up and saw it as it went behind the trees,   Im a jet mechanic in the AF and have never seen anything move that fast, there was no sound at all. Major goosebumps!!!!!;42.2626;-72.2601
