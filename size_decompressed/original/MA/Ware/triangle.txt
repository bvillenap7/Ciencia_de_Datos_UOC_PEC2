My wife saw what appeared at first to be a single light shining up above the softball field.  Called me into the kitchen.  As soon as I saw it, I knew it wasnt of this world.  I took out my phone to take pictures.  As I took my phone out...it went from 1 to 2 to 3 lights.  Primarily white lights, but they did strobe here and there.  It stayed long enough for my son (15 at the time) and myself to get down the trail and to the softball field.  And as soon as we were about down there it disapeared. Also, I want to add that just last week at 5am I witnessed another triangular craft in the sky with solid white pulsating lights.  Somethings going on in my town.  And I have pics.;42.2626;-72.2601
