Formation of 5+ white lights.;2019-06-03 02:26:00;~20 minutes;Formation of 5+ white lights I woke up around 2:00am.  I usually wake up to that time since I am having trouble sleeping sometimes.  This took place around 2:26am, around this time.   I went to go to the bathroom.  I have a window in front of the toilet.  While doing my business, I look outside of the window. I am interested in astronomy, so I look up to the night sky.  I was looking at the stars, and I noticed a very peculiar star, which was brighter than others. It was lights.  From space, not like beams shooting up, but lights.   I first saw what it looked liked to be a star, a white-looking star, then another joined under it, and another under it.  The 3 stars formed in a line.  After about 5 seconds, they merged into one star.  Then the stars looked like it was making an unknown shape.  From what I saw, it looked like a teardrop but the tip was very curved.  I also noticed some sort of beam shining out of the UFO.  I also noticed a minuscule-sized aircraft flying around the light.  The small one was flashing green lights.  Then it faded into nothing.  Came back, then faded once more.  After the 2nd fading, the light never came back.   During this, I decided to go get my camera (I was amazed at the sight, but also still.  But I snapped myself out of it and tried getting the camera).  My camera couldn't take the picture of the lights, everything was too dark.   Keep in mind that that UFOs were at star-length.  They were as far away as if they were blending in with a star.;41.8879;-70.8887
