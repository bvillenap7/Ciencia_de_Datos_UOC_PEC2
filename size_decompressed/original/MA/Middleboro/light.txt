Lighthouse-like light in night sky;2015-10-17 22:00:00;20 minutes;Lighthouse-like light in night sky Around 10pm on 10/17/2015, we first saw a light that was thought to be a the flash of a plane but it didnâ€™t repeat as we expected.  After about 10-15seconds it flashed again.  I would describe the flashing very similar to what you would see from a lighthouse that is very far in the distance.  It was slow & continued the 10-15 second interval cycle the whole time we watched. The object/light also moved many different directions, almost in a distorted figure-8 pattern. It was about 70 degrees above the horizon & while it moved, it covered an area of about 15-20degrees of the sky.  It was seen to the south and eventually we lost sight of it as it moved towards the east and was blocked by branches of trees around us. Absolutely no sound was heard & although the sky was crystal clear at the time, no solid object could be seen, just the flash of light. So curious to see if anyone else saw this and/or if there's an explanation for this sighting.;41.8879;-70.8887
