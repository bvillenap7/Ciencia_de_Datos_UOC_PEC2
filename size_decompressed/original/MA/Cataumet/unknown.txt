NOAA Doppler sees streak across US.;2006-12-13 16:30:00;1 hour;NOAA Doppler sees streak across US. While looking at NOAA's Doppler radar, national mosaic, base reflectivity loop, I noticed a streak crossing nearly the whole US continent. It appeared as what might look like a fireball streak, the length of Massachusetts, appearing to travel from Portland Maine, traversing south west direction in a random zig zag, but not deterring to far off it's course which ended it's travel of my screen out through Texas. The NOAA national mosaic updates one hourly I believe. My guesstimation is that it traveled the distance within 1 hour.  If NOAA keeps records of yesterdays event, NUFORC should investigate this.  Others must have seen this too. ((NUFORC Note:  We doubt that the event was caused by a UFO, but we cannot be certain.  The anomaly may have been caused by a data drop, when the data was downloaded from a weather satellite.  PD));41.6734;-70.6224
