Four spheres darting in the sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible advertising lights?  PD));2013-01-04 01:30:00;5 minutes;four spheres darting in the sky We were outside our home, it was about 1:30 am when my husband told me to look at the sky.  I looked up and asked him what is that?   He replied I don't know and just then the sigle light split into two and then into four and started darting all over the sky, then the lights would come back together, disappear and the reappear.   This went on for five minutes or longer.   We were in awe watching the lights, it was not until they were gone that we realized we had just witnesses a possible UFO sighting.
