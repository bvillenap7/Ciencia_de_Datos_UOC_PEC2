I was on my way to school, sitting on the bus, listening to my head phones. It was light  outside, the sun was already up. I looked up for some reason, and I saw a metallic sphere floating in the sky. At first I thought it was a star, but then I noticed that there were no others like it around. I also noticed that it seemed to be reflecting sunlight, because it was really bright on one side, brighter than the other anyway. It hovered there for maybe 30 more seconds after I saw it, then in an instant, it was gone. I knew then, no star could just vanish like that.;42.1149;-72.191
