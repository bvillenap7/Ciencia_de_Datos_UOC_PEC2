Zig-Zagging flashing cigar shaped objects following the highway for miles seemed to be attached in some way.;2003-08-20 00:00:00;3 minuets;Zig-Zagging flashing cigar shaped objects following the highway for miles seemed to be attached in some way. I was driving West on the Massachusetts Turnpike Route 90, heading towards Albany NY.  It was just after midnight. I noticed some strange flashes of light that seemed to be behind me then in the sky to my left. I was traveling at 70 MPH at the time, traffic was light. It was clear and dry.  These object were high in the sky, I would estimate 3000-4000 feet ?  As I looked more closely they began zig-zagging from one side of the highway to the other in a wide sweeping sharp motion. All this time the 3 objects were flashing and seemed to be chasing or following each other. They accelerated ahead of me , still seaming to follow the highway. They kept zig-zagging back and forth in sharp motions, NO aircraft that I ever saw could make these fast sharp-hard-left to right changes and stay airborne.  Much less 3 following each other in the same manor. The entire crafts were all plusing or flashing from back to front, after 2 to 3  minuets of observation they made  abrupt 90 degree verticle turns and headed straight up, vanishing in the nights' sky.  It almost seemed like they were buzzing the highway, or observing the the many cars with  head & tail lights on traveling at 65-70 MPH, along the highway.  It was hard for me to see exactly what these craft looked like because of the dark-sky and the objects were plusing off & on. I can say that they didn't seem to be very big, and they seemed to be Cigar shaped vs Saucer shaped, much more rocket or missle-like. It also seemed that they were flying Very close to each other,about a ships length apart. They flew so close together it looked like they were towing each other or connected in some way.
