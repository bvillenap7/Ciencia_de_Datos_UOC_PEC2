Blue/white/red/green sphere hoevering, sparkling light in its vacinity.;2014-09-15 03:30:00;60 minutes;blue/white/red/green sphere hoevering, sparkling light in its vacinity At about 330 am, noticed a bright distinct star in the sky I have not noticed before.  Upon looking at with more attention, it was moving side to side and up and down.  It was also flickering different color lights: white/blue, red, green.   At that point it was not a star, it could be an aircraft.  It then began moving in ways that did not indicate an airplane or a helicopter.  No sound came from it, though it seemed far enough away that I would not hear sound from a craft.   I awoke my wife to confirm what I was seeing.  She confirmed it was moving in ways that did not seem natural to a plane.  We also noticed another object but farther away behaving the same way.  It was from my view about 10-15% north of the larger object.   We also began to noticed what can only be described as sparkles around the object.  Not on the object but all around it, some close some farther away.   After watching it for about 45 minutes, I fell back asleep due to the time of the sighting unintentionally.   I would also note that I live near a closed down, small airfield.  It has been closed down for 20 years.;42.1761;-72.3297
