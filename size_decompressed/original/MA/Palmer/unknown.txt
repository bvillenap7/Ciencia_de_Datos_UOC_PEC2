Unknown black object caught fling straight up on video tape by accident.;2000-07-09 12:00:00;Approx. 1 Min.;Unknown black object caught fling straight up on video tape by accident. I was Video taping footage of a large flag at the local Big Y store for a Patriotic Video I was making for local public access TV. I was not aware I had captured any other objects while I was filming. Later during the editimg process is when I noticed just to the left of the flag in the clouds, a small black object slowly moving upward to the top of the screen. I played the clip back over several times and could not identify this object. I showed the clip to a few volunteers that were there and they could not identify the object either. lacking the equipment to zoom in and see the object better I made a copy of the clip and sent it into a local UFO investigating outfit. They reviewed the clip and their responce was Verry Interesting, We are sending this out to texas for further study That is the last I heard of the matter. I have made several inquiries since then and got no responce.;42.1761;-72.3297
