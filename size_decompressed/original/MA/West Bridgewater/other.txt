BRIGHT GLOWING OBJECT    WEST BRIDGEWATER    MAY 26    10:10PM;2007-05-26 23:30:00;1 MIN;BRIGHT GLOWING OBJECT    WEST BRIDGEWATER    MAY 26    10:10PM I came home late and my fianc√© yelled at me that she had seen a UFO.  She told me that it was a glowing light over the tree line that got bigger and when it came towards her she ran in the house.  It was very bright and made no noise.  She was terrified and would not go outside alone for weeks.  On May 29 I went on another site and posted the question if anyone else had seen anything.  I now see on this site that other people have seen this.  I am trying to get her to give a full account but she is somewhat embarrassed about seeing a UFO.;42.0227;-71.018
