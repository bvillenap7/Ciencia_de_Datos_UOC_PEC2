Large gray object viewed for approx 30-45 sec;2003-12-03 15:43:00;approx 45 sec;Large gray object viewed for approx 30-45 sec At 15:30 I was going home after working my part time job.  While attempting to make a left on to a very busy street I noticed an object in the sky.  At my location it was easy to gain repeated visuals of the target as there was a fixed object (telephone pole)which the target was in close proximity (like lining up the sights on a rifle), total approx viewing time 30- 45 sec.  The object caught my eye because it reflected light from the sun (like a single mirror).  The object appeared to be large and stationary (that is to say it did not appear to shrink or grow in size due to forward or reverse motion, also, it did not move Left or Right or up and down in my view of the horizon).  The object appeared to be shiny gray in color and oval in shape.  As I looked at the sun in the West the object was about 45 degrees from it at my location.  When I looked away (to check for on coming traffic) to make a left (heading west) the target was no longer their.  I scanned the horizon to reacquire the target, but it was gone.  I do not believe it was a plane (to large, no contrails,and not the right shape), at first I thought a blimp, but I could have easily found the target again as a blimp cannot deviate so drastically as to appear to vanish.  The day was cold (approx 33 degrees) the sky had very little clouds (the thin ones that are high in the atmosphere), However, nothing could have obstructed my view.;42.0227;-71.018
