Yellow light close to moon emits beam through  trees;2001-06-07 01:00:00;15 minutes;Yellow light close to moon emits beam through  trees Last night at 1am, I was in my Sudbury backyard surveying the bright moonlit sky when the already bright night intensified almost as if someone had turned on a bright light.  That's when I noticed a very bright yellowish light shining through the trees the light it emitted shone on my pool cover.  Admittedly, the light was obscured because of the trees so I don't know the true shape.  The light was fairly close to the left of the moon, as it faces the earth.  I do not know if what I saw was a planet or a star and I'm hoping someone can let me know if that is the case.  I was the only person, as far is I know, to see the sky object because most people are in bed that late but I am a night owl. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness was observing a celestial body, perhaps Mars, which is quite prominent in the night sky at present.  PD));42.3822;-71.4275
