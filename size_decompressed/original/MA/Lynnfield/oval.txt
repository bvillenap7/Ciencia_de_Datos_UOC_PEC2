Possible oval blinking UFO shown, with shooting star directly next to it.;2007-11-10 23:00:00;Less than 1 minute;Possible oval blinking UFO shown, with shooting star directly next to it. I was outside, just got dropped off back home, and I saw few strange lights in the sky.  Very starry night, by the way.  It was moving to the right side-ways slowly, blinking a red and a blue light.  Looked like it could be an airplane, but airplanes don't move sideways, nor are they oval shaped.  Right after I noticed it, I saw a shooting star go by further to the right of it, but close to it too.  I watched it for about 40-60 seconds.  I went into my house to find a family member to see it, but we went outside and it was gone.  It was in a very clear area where there weren't too many stars, so it just disappearing was very strange.;42.5327;-71.0339
