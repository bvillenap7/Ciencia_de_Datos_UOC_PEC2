Followed orange glowing object for 3/4 of a mile.;2000-06-11 02:16:00;1.5 - 2.0 min;Followed orange glowing object for 3/4 of a mile. On 6/11/00 at 2:16AM, while traveling west on RT.9 in Framingham, MA by the shopping mall I observed an object that looked like a semi deflated hot air baloon approx. 40' round gloing orange in color.  This object cought my attention as it appeared to be falling or drifiting off one of the buildings in the east bound lane. As I quickly approched the building I observed this object near  i noticed the object  was moving. I began to pick up speed to catch up to this object at one point  I was going 65mph and still not gaining on it. This went on for approx. 3/4 of a mile, I could see it very clearly it was moving just above the tree line moving west in the east bound side of the road when it just vanished over Oalks St. In Framingahm.

Bright Blue Orb descending in night sky;2014-12-14 22:30:00;3 seconds;Bright Blue Orb descending in night sky Was driving northwest through Framingham, and I saw a large, bright electric blue orb. It was a blue I'd never seen before.  Much like a blue Christmas light. but orbital, gigantic and bright, and a bit more cyan than a Christmas light.  It seemed to take a downward arc from a high altitude, and it went as far down as I could see behind the trees along the horizon about a mile away from me, near Nobscot mountain.   It was difficult to measure scale, but I'd estimate it was about the size of a full-size pickup truck, length-wise. It was not a flare, airplane, helicopter, or meteor, which I've seen many of at night.   The behavior, speed, trajectory, size and color were enough to add up to an anomalous object in the night sky.  It never faded, didn't have a trail of any sort, and had a slight flare around it, due to the brightness of the object.;42.2946566929133;-71.4301905511811
