Dark shape in nighttime sky.;2007-03-26 23:15:00;2 minutes;Dark shape in nighttime sky. It was late at night and I was having trouble falling asleep. All of a sudden I hear this loud noise. I look out the window and see this shape that was darker then the night time sky. The lights were red, blue and an off-whit the lights were'nt blinking just solid lights and they were on every side that I could see. It wasn't slow but not really fast either.;42.2946566929133;-71.4301905511811
Several craft moving at constant speed in sweeping patterns towards the city and back to the north.;2015-09-21 23:30:00;1 hour;Several craft moving at constant speed in sweeping patterns towards the city and back to the north. From the night of the 16th and into tonight, each night, there have been several craft moving across the sky in several passes towards the city.  The craft display several blinking patterns of light.  There is a red light, a green light, and between 2 or 4 white lights.  The lights that are turned on, and the way they fire, seems to follow different patterns.  The craft have been moving after 11PM and until 1 or 2 in the morning.  They often make several sweeps, towards the city to the South East, and then come back to the North. The presence of Hanscomb Air Force Base makes for a number of possibilities, but there is something eery about their movements and their presence.  They seem to move in a very steady speed, but much slower than an airplane.  There is no sound in their presence.  It is also strange because whenever they appear over head, the neighbors dog who is always outside begins to bark incessantly.;42.2946566929133;-71.4301905511811
Strange flash of light seen.;2016-11-04 07:20:00;1 second;Strange flash of light seen This morning on my commute to work, I witnessed an inexplicable occurence.  I was making my way around a corner, and all of a sudden there was a giant flash of light, as if a lightning bolt struck the ground ~3 cars in front of me. The surrounding area lit up accordingly, however there was no logically complimentary sound alongside it.  At the same time, there was a low whirring sound, comparable to that of a car accelerating, however there were no aircraft present in the sky, and there was no wreckage or debris that might be found if a car explodes or something like that. This was a large flash of light, so it couldn't have been a streetlamp going out, it was something large and encompassing. Shortly after the flash of light, the sky quickly filled with clouds, when before the occurrence, the sky was clear. The cars in front of me stopped, and a few people got out and looked around to see if this was an ongoing event.  I was concerned about the incident, but I didn't want to stick around to see what happened next(if anything did happen next).;42.2946566929133;-71.4301905511811
