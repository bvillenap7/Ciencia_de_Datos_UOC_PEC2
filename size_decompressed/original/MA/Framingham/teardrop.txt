One of which was a cold blue color and the other was a ruby red color.  I noticed that they were flying rather slowly, almost just hovering in the air.  I had a feeling that they were not airplanes or helicopters, as they were merely just circling each other.  I went to take my phone out to take a photograph, and just as I did that, the UFO's flew very quickly straight up in the air, and then off into the distance at an incredible speed.  I have also noticed over the past two years two scars appearing on my inner thighs, one about a year ago, and one more recently.  I cannot account for how either one got on my legs, nor can I remember ever getting them, as I noticed them and they seemed fully healed.  One of which is larger than the newer one, and I absolutely without a doubt can say that there is nothing which I can account for which would cause these fully healed scars to appear in what seems like overnight.;42.2946566929133;-71.4301905511811
