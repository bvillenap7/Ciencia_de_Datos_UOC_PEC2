I looked at the tree line in my back yard and saw an orange ball of light kind of floating.  At first I thought it was a helicopter from the State police barracks near my home, but it wasn't moving up like a helicopter would when it is taking off.  This orange ball was moving from side to side, then it looked like it was moving up and then it would float some more.   I had my husband and kids come out to look because I just wanted someone else to witness it.  My husband thought it may be a plane, but I made him stand with me just to see how weird this thing was moving.  This went on for over an hour.  It wasn't a balloon or helicopter or plane.  It wasn't a star. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Venus or Jupiter?  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
