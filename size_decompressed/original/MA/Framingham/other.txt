WHEN IT WENT 'OFF'  THREE SMALL LIGHTS APPEARED, IN A ROW, THEN THEY TOO WENT OFF. IT BLOCKED THE TREE IT WAS IN FRONT OF, OR AROUND. HEIGHT WAS 50' WIDTH APPROX. 20' THE SHAPE FROM THE 2ND FLOOR WAS FUNNEL.  I WAS ON THE 1ST FLOOR AND COULD ONLY SEE THE TOP. THE COLOR SEEN BY THE TWO OF US WAS DIFFERENT, MY SON SAID IT WAS WHITE, I THOUGHT IT WAS YELLOW OR GREEN.  BUT THE SMALL LIGHTS WERE DEFENITLY SPARKLING WHITE.;42.2946566929133;-71.4301905511811
Two objects seen north of Mass Pike (Framingham-Southboro-Westboro.;2013-10-21 08:15:00;5:00;Two objects seen north of Mass Pike (Framingham-Southboro-Westboro Noticed on the way to work (driving on the Masspike â€“ Rt 90), heading Eastbound, an object in the sky that was not moving.   At first I assumed that it was a traffic helicopter but as I kept creeping forward in traffic, over a 5-minute time, the object was not moving at all and seemed too high to be a helicopter (estimate 10,000 feet in altitude).   I continued to watch it for movement.  The object did not move.    Before I got off Exit 12, I looked once more and noticed a second, object beyond, yet parallel to the first object.  This second object did have the same size as the first but appear to be less opaque.   After exiting to my nearby workplace I tried again to spot the object but they were not longer present.;42.2946566929133;-71.4301905511811

I could see the object but could not make it out because it was too far.;42.2946566929133;-71.4301905511811
