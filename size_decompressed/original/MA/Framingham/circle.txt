On this particular night I noticed 2 bright lights in the sky over near an airforce base.  They were next to each other hovering but one was a little bit higher than other but they werent blinking like an airplane or jet would.  I grabbed my phone & started recording..after about 15 seconds one blinked out but not totally..I saw a teeny but of light left as it moved horizontally across the sky then the 2nd lighr totally disappeared.  There was no sound.  I thought might be drones but after looking at the videos & a screenshot from the video I'm not so sure.  I emailed a copy of the videos & screenshot.  (My hand got a little shakey sorry.);42.2946566929133;-71.4301905511811

They were blinking in and out Me and my nephew and my son witnessed for glowing red orbs moving at a high rate of speed through a clear night sky. The brightest one maintained its form for 3 to 4 minutes as it moved west to east. Two others moving at a high rate of speed following the same trajectory blinked in and out. There was not a cloud in the sky. The fourth glowing red ball was flying directly towards us and made a dramatic 90° angle turn.While we continue to witness these glowing red balls moving away from us something flashed bright above our heads and blinked out again. The whole event lasted at least four minutes. We took some video on our phones but the resolution isn’t very good.;42.2946566929133;-71.4301905511811
