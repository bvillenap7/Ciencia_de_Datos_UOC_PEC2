Initially thought to be a satellite until I realized there were actually three separate objects. Appeared to be at same altitude and speed as most satellites I have observed. At a given point, the objects turned northward and went out of sight by distance factor. What caught my foremost interest was fact that the lights separated when they made the turn northward, then closed again as they moved away, thus my belief they were separate objects. Lights on the objects were white in color and not blinking at all. Same light intensity as a satellite or a distant star. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the lights may have been the three satellites that have been reported to us frequently.  They are thought to be part of the U. S. Navy NOSS satellite project.

It appeared to be stationary but there was some movement. I had my video camera on my and zoomed in to find that the object was in fact 4 lights in the sky in close formation.;42.2946566929133;-71.4301905511811
Unidentified lights;2003-09-16 22:00:00;1 hour;Unidentified lights My wife and I noticed a blink star in the sky.  With a pair of binoculars, we were able to tell that the object was changing colors rapidly from red to blue to white and perhaps some other colors.  The object was stationary and never moved for close to an hour.  We scanned the sky and noticed at least four other such objects, also rapidly changing colors.  These were moving across the sky and changing directions several times.  At one point, two of the moving objects approached the third stationary obejct in a approximate triangle formation and then veered off again.  We are both white-collar professionals.  We don't buy into the whole UFO-thing easily, ut we do not have a rationale explanation for what we saw. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that a twinkling star would be the first possibility to be ruled out.  PD));42.2946566929133;-71.4301905511811

Light hovered then appeared to make small circles before disappearing down horizon.  ((Venus??));2020-03-31 22:20:00;10 minutes;Light hovered then appeared to make small circles before disappearing down horizon. The light appeared to be hovering in the sky. Seemed to be in one place too long and too bright to be a plane.  Possibly a helicopter yet there was no flashing lights seen around it. It appeared in the north west sky not too high off the horizon. At first I thought it was the ISS. But a Google search confirms the ISS was south of the equator near Africa. As I went closer to window it appeared to be making small circles in the sky. It then slowly moved down toward the northern horizon and fell below the trees.;42.2946566929133;-71.4301905511811
