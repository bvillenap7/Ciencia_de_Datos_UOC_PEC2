On May 13, 2010, around 11:30P.M., I was laying in bed next to my sleeping girlfriend and staring out her window. It was dark due to overcast, so there were no stars in sight. I was tracing the outline of a pine tree in her yard against the dark sky, and noticed at first what I thought to be a star, behind a branch of this tree.  I noticed it as the wind caused it's branches to sway, revealing this object. Then this star began to slowly move out from behind this tree.  It was an orange-gold in color and spherical, much like a star would be, but it shone much, much brighter.  Also, it's movements were rather peculiar - it's rate of motion wasn't necessarily fast, but it definitely did NOT move at a constant rate.  It would move across the sky slowly, then speed up slightly, then slow again, almost like it was floating or dancing.  Also, it did not move in straight lines, it would wobble almost, and sway slightly as it moved. I watched this object move around the sky in this strange fashion for about a minute, when I realized I should wake my sleeping girlfriend to show her too.  I woke her, and then we watched for about another minute.  Then, it slipped back behind the tree, and I struggled to follow it through the branches.  A jet or a plane then came into sight as it flew across the sky, and I knew it was a jet or plane due to the strobe lights on it, and its steady rate of movement across the sky.  It also flew out of sight behind this large tree, into the same vicinity as the object. I watched this tree closely, the jet passed out on the other side of it, but the object in question never re-emerged from behind it and vanished.;42.5805;-70.7728
