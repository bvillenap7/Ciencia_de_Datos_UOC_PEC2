He came in and asked his older brother (my 20 year old son) if he wanted to see a UFO.  I laughed, said I do and went out on the deck.  My 20 year old followed.  The weather was slightly overcast but visibility was good.  We watched this slow moving dark object for a few minutes.  No one said anything as we studied it.   Finally I said what the heck is that?  It was at the hight of an air plane, moving in an unusual floating maner.  It was too large to be a helicopter, parashoot or hot air baloon.  At first I thought it was a large blimp.  However I have never seen a blimp that large or at that high Alititude.  It appeared to turn and flip over.   As it turned the shape changed to the shape of a donut.   The boys said it is a saucer.  I said it looks like it has a whole in the middle.  One boy said perhaps the middle is white. We all watched it until it moved out of site.  None of us could figure out what it was.  I called the local airport this morning to ask if they new anything about it.  hey didn't.;41.8915;-70.7646
