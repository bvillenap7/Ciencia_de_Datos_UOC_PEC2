It didn't  move very much it just hung there in silence.  I watched it for quite some time.  I had my girlfriends , friends  pull over up the street.  At it was then I thought it would be a  good idea to walk out to the far side of the boggs, it was quiet and much darker  I snapped 10 pictures of the craft.  I looked away and engaged  in conversation when I looked back it was gone I did not  see it leave and it didn't  make a sound.  i only witnessed one craft, it moved strangely  when it did it had lights on all sides;41.8915;-70.7646
