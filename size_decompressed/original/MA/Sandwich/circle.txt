As I arrived for my job (a private home health aide) apprx. at 9:05 pm.  I came into the driveway to see a friend who works here and her boyfriend outside gazing at the sky.  They explained that there were starnge objects in the sky. i looked up to see about 12 circular bright orange lights in the sky above the water.  I watched for about a minute, went into the house to get a video camera and as I returned outside the objects were dissapearing in mid air one by one from the right side.  A little after that, we saw an  object that looked like an airplane going toward the cape cod canal from where we are and there were two or three of the unknown objects to the right of the supposed airplane.  But to the left and below the aircraft was another unknown orange circular object.  Within two - three minutes the objects dissapeared but the spacecraft was still in eye sight.;41.7111;-70.4887
