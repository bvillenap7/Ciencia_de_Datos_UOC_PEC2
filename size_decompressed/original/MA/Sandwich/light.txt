The sky was very cloudy, and the only celestial light that was visible through the clouds at all was the muted light of the moon, behind us as we faced Cape Cod Bay.   I was disappointed that we wouldn’t be able to see any stars or planets, due to the cloud cover, but I continued to look up.  That’s when I noticed two bright, but muted, lights shining through the clouds...one almost as bright as the muted light of the moon.  The other smaller, but also bright enough to be seen through the clouds.   They just hung in the sky motionless over Sandwich or the Canal area.  They weren’t moving and I could hear no sound.  I brought these lights to the attention of the group and asked if anyone had any idea what these lights might be, since they seemed almost as bright as the moon.  My wife joked that maybe they’re UFOs, and everyone went back to socializing.    When I looked back a few minutes later, the two lights were gone and didn’t return the rest of the night.;41.7111;-70.4887
