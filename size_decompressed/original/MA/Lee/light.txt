Leaving Lee Ma driving to Westfield exit.  We saw bright white light stationary in the sky the whole ride while on the pike.  When I got home around 8 pm or a few min after that I went outside to feed my horses.   As soon as I stepped out on my deck, a large craft was flying low over my home. It was square or diamond shaped...it was dark, but had lights underneath, made a noise but not too loud, no wings, no tail.  Flew slow and low heading north.   I live 15 min from an air force base...so maybe a military craft??  Was it the bright light I saw on ride home?  I don't know. But I've never seen anything like either of these.  Wish I captured it on video.;42.2990000000004;-73.2317000000002
