The light started to move East down Waltham Street for no more than 2000 feet, and reversed direction back over the Fire Station, towards Stow Mass.  I drove in the same direction but lost sight of the object.  The object was small in size like a helicopter but silent.   The blue light was intense and could not make out what the craft shape was.  It was definitely not a helicopter or small plane, nor was it an ultralight.   Entire event was less than 5 minutes, before losing sight of the object.;42.4337;-71.4568
