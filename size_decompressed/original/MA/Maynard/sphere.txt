Flying lightbulb the size of a basketball over Maynard, MA.;2013-11-29 20:10:00;10 seconds;Flying lightbulb the size of a basketball over Maynard MA While driving south on Parker St (rt 27), an object passed over head just above the tree lines.  It was round about the size of a basketball and glowed like a light bulb with a surrounding blue hue.   The object travelled east to west at a constant velocity and on a straight line but looked to be coming down.  Possibly landing nearby.   Both of us are at a loss as to what this could have been.;42.4337;-71.4568
