I was standing in the parking lot of the Shaw’s supermarket at 8:15 pm.  I looked up into the sky and I saw a very bright object of thin rectangular shape, with no lights flashing or blinking, that moved quicker than any airplane I’ve ever seen.  The light dimmed into the sky and there were no clouds for it to hide behind it was as though it had evaporated.   The light was of a fluorescent quality, very white.   I followed the object for about 20 seconds and then I saw a second object and shortly thereafter a third object.  The lights of the second and third objects also just dimmed into the distance without blinking.;42.4337;-71.4568
