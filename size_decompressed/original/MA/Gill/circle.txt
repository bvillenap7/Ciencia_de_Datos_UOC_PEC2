Out on my deck looking west, southwest, I saw a light in the overcast sky.    Noted that it couldn’t be a planet because of the cloud cover - early evening not yet dark.  Figured it was a plane.  Bright yellow-ish white circular light like the forward light of a plane.    Expected it to be a plane, but after tracking a straight line from SW to NW (roughly) it suddenly ascended straight up.   Saw it move upward for a few seconds and then it disappeared – in front of the cloud cover. Never seen anything like it before.  Didn't think to report such a small event, but watching a video, I got curious and I see that a number of sightings were reported in my area around the same time.   I thought I had written the date in my journal, but I didn't,  it was a few weeks ago.    I listed 2/4 because of the prevalence of reportings in my neck of the woods then.   Can’t be certain which day, though.   I told my son about it a few days later - he says that was a couple of weeks ago. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));42.6404;-72.4972
