Then as the plane flew out of view out from behind where the airplane was I saw six white spotlights sitting in the sky.  The lights then slowly dispersed up unto the sky at different angles.  I would describe it like you have a closed fist and then you open it wide and watching the tips of your fingers go into different directions.  The lights got less visible the more they spread out.  I stood there to wait to see if I saw anything more and nothing else happened.;42.2126;-70.9155
