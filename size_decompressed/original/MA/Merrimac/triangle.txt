Massachsuetts - 1996 - Very Clear, Unmistakable, Evening Sighting;1996-11-01 19:00:00;40 seconds;Massachsuetts - 1996 - Very Clear, Unmistakable, Evening Sighting On an evening in the first week of November 1996, my father and I exited our home en route to my high school for a sports banquet that evening.  Approximately 200 yards away, and no more than 1500 feet above us a very large, almost intimidating triangular shaped object emerged from above the tree line of the woods behind our home.  In a methodical and gradual fashion the object passed over us, stopping momentarily directly above us, and then erupting in silent force took off at an incomprehendable speed and vanished into the sky rapidly climbing in altitude.  The object must have been between 80 and 100 yards long, and at its widest point near its base between 60 and 80 yards proportionally.  It's base, which we saw, was illuminated with 9 orange lights which were bright but unabrasive, and were in a 4-3-2-1 pattern from the base to the tip.  The corners of the object were rounded and appeared glossy or metallic in material.  The sighting occured around 7:00pm on a very clear evening on a dark and rural street. After it dissapeared, my father simply looked at me and said, it's the not the first time you'll see one around here, so get used to it, but don't tell anyone, they will all think you're crazy.
