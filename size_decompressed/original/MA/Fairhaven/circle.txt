A couple of friends and I were looking to the skys for any air traffic since there was only military traffic alowed. We saw two Air Force Jets in single file heading toward Otis Air Force Base in Cape Cod. They were fairly close together and in quite a hurry. Approxamatly one minute after these jets flew out of sight, my friend pointed out a circular object orange in color moving at an enormous rate of speed across the open sky. It seemed to zigzag and dance across the sky as if it was intelligent, and then disapeared behind some trees. Ive never seen anything as fast as this in mid air. About ten min past and we kept looking in amazment for anything else when the same object came across the sky again from the east to south west with the same speed and spiratic movement, and again disapeared behind some trees. This is what we seen and Im sticking to it.;41.637;-70.8884
