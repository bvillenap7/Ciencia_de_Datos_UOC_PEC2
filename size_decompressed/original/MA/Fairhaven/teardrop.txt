On August 4, 2013, I saw a tear-drop shaped light in the sky around 3 AM.  I tried filming the object, but I struggled filming and zooming in on the object.   I followed it in the sky for over an hour.  It disappeared and then reappeared above my house and I was able to get some footage.   I am not thrilled with the pictures and video as I struggled with a new camera to get a clear picture.   I am happy, however, that I have something to look at.   I have had past experiences with sightings.   I have been sky-watching for close to 30 years, and actually woke my daughter to join me outdoors to see the object moving in the night sky.;41.637;-70.8884
