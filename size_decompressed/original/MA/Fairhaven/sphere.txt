Unknown brilliant spheres baffles Massachussetts teacher;2001-04-22 06:33:00;5 minutes;Unknown brilliant spheres baffles Massachussetts teacher There were four distinct balls of light that were circling a larger sphere of light as they slowy moved west to east across the horizon line on the outskirts of the city of Fairhaven MA. The spheres were orange and yellow in color and were well defined spherical in shape. As I sat at a stop light after buying my lunch at a local grocery store they seemed to be playing intricate game in which the smaller balls of light performed corkscrewing and spiraling manuevers of the like I have never seen. I have been to hundreds of airshows and familiar with every type of aircraft known to be in use by military and civilian air forces and company and these fit no description or executed manuevers impossible to human aircraft. As soon as I saw them I was stunned, I couldnt believe my eyes and as soon as the light turned green I floored the accelerater and took off after them. It was a straight piece of road that lead to another intersection and by the time I reached it they just slipped out of site. I pulled into the parking lot of a used car dealership and looked aroud the sky . I could not see them so I headed into work . When I mentioned it to a couple of co-workers they said I should stop snorting cocaine. The only problem with this is that I dont do drugs and I know what I saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Given that the lights changed color during the observation, we presume, therefore, that they were probably not being generated by an advertising light.  PD));41.637;-70.8884
