In June 2004 me and two other friends were driving through Plymouth, almost into Carver when I spotted out my window what looked at first to be the moon.  I asked my friends what they all thought of it, and we all agreed that there was no way it was the moon.  It was moving slowly across the sky and was hovering much closer and lower that the moon appears in the sky   I really couldnâ€™t tell you how far away it was, but the object was almond shaped, and was illuminated almost like the moon.  It slowly moved north towards Taunton and Boston, MA. We were able to watch it slowly move north and get smaller till we lost it in the distant trees as we were driving south on 495.  We never told many people what we had seen, but we know what we saw and it still gives me goose bumps to this day whenever we talk about it.  We were just curious if anyone else had ever seen a UFO illuminated like the moon before. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
