We saw a bright bluish-white oval shape in the sky, it looked almost like a halogen light.  The object was travelling from South to North over the bay area.  The craft was completely silent.  We saw it for a split second and then it disappeared.  About 30 min after the sighting we saw about 3 coast guard helicopters combing the beach area.  The next day we saw a lot of military helicopters searching the area, and three chinook helicopters were flying about 50-100ft over our house.
