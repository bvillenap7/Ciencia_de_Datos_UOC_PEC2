Six Color-Changing Orbs Spotted, No Stars About It.;2013-01-10 05:31:00;5:31-?;Six Color-Changing Orbs Spotted, No Stars About It. We looked up to see some flickering lights and they were all lined up in a triangle.  One light changed from blue to green.  Another was orange, and the rest disapeared and reappeared,  It was crazy. My mom, sister, brother, cousin, nana, and grampa all came out to look.  The irony is, I never believed in UFO's until I saw this tonight, and as I speak, they are still here.   This time they are all green, slightly changing colors to blue to orange and then to green.   We didn't notice this until my brother came in screaming, &quotI just saw FOUR military aircrafts fly by  Our Tv also made a wierd fuzzy sound with our audio.;41.9215331210192;-70.64339044586

Bright light moving in the sky at ASTRONOMICAL speed then disappearing, re-appearing  and plummeting to earth.;2019-11-30 06:00:00;15 seconds;Bright light moving in the sky at ASTRONOMICAL speed then disappearing, re-appearing  and plummeting to earth I was leaving work at 6 am heading on I-93 North towards Boston.  The sun was rising in the east but was still dark in front me.  About 15 minutes out I saw a bright light appear in the high-center of the sky.  It was perfectly centered in my windshield. It appeared to be somewhat close in the distance.  It then looked as tho it was coming at me and turning slightly to the right (making a j like movement) leaving a trail of light behind it,  but then suddenly disappearing.  I looked all around the sky in front of me and about 5 seconds later, I see a dimmer light in the left hand corner of my windshield.  For a split second it stayed and suddenly curved downward and  started “nose diving” down but WITHOUT a trail of light following it.. unfortunately the tree’s then obstructed my view and I couldn’t see anything else.  These lights happened SO FAST that no air craft could have caused this, and a meteor just doesn’t fit the script.;41.9215331210192;-70.64339044586
Lights, white on top, flickering colors on bottom.;2021-05-31 20:49:00;3-5 minutes;Lights, white on top, flickering colors on bottom. Several lights seen on distant horizon. They appeared to be mostly bright white at the top, almost like flickering strings of colored lights dangling from the bottoms that seemed to fade in and out, got video on my phone, but not the best quality. Too high to be a structure (I thought it initially was cell towers with lights on them, and I couldn’t see the base, but then they moved and flickered off and on). We were driving at the time, and I had not mentioned them at first, until the passenger said “what is that?”. Shortly after they seemed to fade into the twilight (occurred at dusk), there were several airplanes observed flying in that general direction. No mention of anything on the news, I would think it was witnessed by many more than just us, seemed to be in the Taunton/ Attleboro/ Providence, RI direction, and they were located on the distant horizon, which means they must have been bright to cast lights that far away…;41.9215331210192;-70.64339044586
