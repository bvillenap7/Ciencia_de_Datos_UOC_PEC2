Orange fireball shaped objects over Plymouth Harbour.;2015-08-05 20:00:00;10 minutes;Orange fireball shaped objects over Plymouth Harbour. We were out sitting at the Plymouth waterfront, at around 8:00 pm, when we started to notice orange fireball shaped objects slowly appearing over the western horizon, and rising slowly upward.  They would slowly arc out to the east over the ocean and then fade out.  Once one was gone another would appear from the west.   This lasted for about ten minutes and then it was done.   There was absolutely no sound with them at all.;41.9215331210192;-70.64339044586
Pulsating/flickering fire ball orbs;2017-04-13 20:30:00;25 minutes;Pulsating/flickering fire ball orbs On Thursday, 04-13-17, myself and my two children witnessed multiple crafts that resembled flashing orbs or fireballs.  They were in the northern sky over the coast line, within a 2 mile radius of the local nuclear power plant.   They would appear to hover or float along and glide.  They flicker on and off like a lightbulb, and seem to disappear when airplanes fly by.  Occasionally, they would light up very bright like a fireball, but flash in an array of colors that resembled a mystic topaz or fire opal.   I have them on video that I recorded on my iPhone 6s Plus.;41.9215331210192;-70.64339044586
