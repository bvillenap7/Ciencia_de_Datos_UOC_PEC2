I am writing this belated report on Sept 8th 2001.  (I will bring you all up-to-date in an other report for our more recent observations. But let me first tell you this... My wife and kids where taking a ride to go to dinner, we got on Rt 3 North from Exit 6, as was merging on to the highway I pointed out to my wife something in the sky, it looked like a star but is was moving, we then saw two fighter jets scrambling up there. This was over Plymouth Bay... I got off the highway and headed towards the bay and saw the jets again going north, so I turned around and headed up Rt 3A and thought it was all over because I am in a car not a plain so I cant chase anything.  So about 2mile I pull into the Charlie Horse Bar & Grill. I pulled right up front because it look like there would be a wait, so to save time I just opened my door and looked up and WOW! No Sound, 4 Lights (3 white on each point one in the middle), Black Triangle shaped Craft Just over the oak trees aside the resraunt.  It freek me out, I stuck my head in the car and told my wife what is over us, but I did not want to scare my two kids 1 and 5 at the time.  My wife looked at me an told me I know....now shut (()) up!!  I was shocked at her attitude! She never talks like that.  I just got into the car and went to KFC and said nothing about it again to her. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));41.9215331210192;-70.64339044586
3 lights, flying just above treetops headed east on Rt. 44 just past the highway.;2010-08-29 21:00:00;2 min;3 lights, flying just above treetops headed east on Rt. 44 just past the highway. I am reporting this months later because I stumbled on this website. I just wanted to say that I saw what had to be the same UFO as the post I saw sighted by Esta Rd. on Rt. 44. When I saw it, it was headed east on Rt. 44, just past the intersection of Rt. 3 (a highway). While Rt. 44 is not a highway, it is a very busy street with grocery stores, gas stations and such, and it was flying much lower and slower than an airplane would fly. It made no sound. It had 3 unblinking orbs of light, and was clearly triangle shaped. It wasn't much higher than the treetops. I had just pulled into a grocery store parking lot, saw it, stopped the car, rolled down the windows, and my son and I just stared at it and watched it head east down 44.

Red and white lights, Seen on Rt. 44 east shortly before Esta Rd;2010-08-29 21:00:00;under 10 seconds;Red and white lights, Seen on Rt. 44 east shortly before Esta Rd Driving east on rt. 44 (coming up on Esta Rd)saw object hovering about 20 feet above tree tops, and about 10 feet away from road, approximately where there is a pond.   Coming up on it I thought it was a helicopter (possibly looking for the couple of people that have been reported missing over the past couple weeks).   As I drove a little closer i realized that it was not a helicopter.  it was pefectly still and made no noise (windows down and no radio).  Driving under it i noticed the triangle pattern of lights.  i drove past it and turned around, in that time it was gone.   Thinking that maybe becasue where i turned around was at the bottom of a hill so maybe that was why i couldnt see it, i back tracked.  also to make sure maybe it wasnt just a pole with lights or something but it was indeed completely gone.;41.9215331210192;-70.64339044586
