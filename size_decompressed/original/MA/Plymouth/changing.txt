My fianci who works for loss prevention, noticed a square light floating just above the trees.   Once she said something to us it floated horizontally across the top of the trees when we saw it, it looked like a floating lantern.  It went behind the trees.   When we could see it again a few second later it was up hire and now Orange.  Then it was gone.;41.9215331210192;-70.64339044586
