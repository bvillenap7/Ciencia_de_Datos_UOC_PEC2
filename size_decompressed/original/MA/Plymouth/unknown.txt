Orange light over the sky;2008-08-15 09:30:00;1min 30 sec;Orange light over the sky At 9:30 p.m my girlfriend and I witnessed a bright orange shimmering light arc from the tree line. After rising at a arc for 15 seconds the light started to move in a straight line across the sky, after a minute and a half the light just vanished, in the direction of a lightning storm over the ocean. We thought it might be ash or a flare but ash wouldn’t have burned for that long and a flare would’ve stayed in the arc formation.;41.9215331210192;-70.64339044586
Star like, but strange movement (stop, reverse, triangle).;2010-07-04 23:30:00;~5 minutes;Star like, but strange movement (stop, reverse, triangle) July 4th 2010, my boyfriend, myself and another couple we were friends with spent the day in Plymouth, planning to go to the bonfires and see the fireworks at Whitehorse beach.  We had gotten there too late and missed the fires and fireworks (it was probably close to midnight) but decided to hang out on the beach for a little bit anyway.   We were all just talking when one of our friends, who was lying down, pointed up and said something along the lines of, watch that weird star move  I looked up expecting to see a shooting star, or maybe a satellite.   At first glance I thought maybe it was a satellite, because it moved slowly and steadily in one direction...then it stopped. That's when started to really look at it. It was very high up, maybe higher than an airplane, and it looked very much like a star except when it moved, It sort of reflected the star light around it. I was silvery blue light like many stars, but a little brighter and the shine was almost wobbly, if that makes sense.  The movement was not of any craft I've ever seen, or know of being used publicly by the military. the star traveled left in a smooth straight line, stopped, then went back to the right.  It moved back and forth a few times until it stopped to the right, then started to make a triangle pattern around a single (real) star, stopping at each corner of the triangle.  It did this a few times as well then went back to the left again slowly as it did before, then it suddenly shot up to the left and disappeared as if it shot out of the atmosphere. All four of saw it. I do not know what it was, but it is ingrained in my memory and I would be happy to answer any questions.;41.9215331210192;-70.64339044586

At first there was one and I watched it go by until I could no longer see it because it grew dim.  Then three more came together by traveling in the same direction.  Finally two more came by also traveling in the same direction.;41.9215331210192;-70.64339044586
