Bright White Saucer Shaped Object Sighted At Tree Height;2004-11-08 20:30:00;2 minutes;Bright White Saucer Shaped Object Sighted At Tree Height I'm filing this report on behalf of my wife. She was returning back after picking my son up from the sitters. When she got home and got out of the car she noticed a disk shaped object hovering at tree height over our property. She clearly spotted 4 windows on the object. The object was very brightly lit. The object was not making any sound. My son got out of the car and saw it too. She thought the color of the object was silver gray. My wife just rushed inside the house with my son and did not look back at the object as she was begining to get very aprehensive.  She also said that she had seen a bright white light en route home from the sitters but did not think much of it at that time.;42.2187;-71.5351
