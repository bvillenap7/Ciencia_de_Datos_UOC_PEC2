My Dad saw a ball of what looked like fire in the backyard of my Aunt's house about 1/4 mile high.  The flames were going up not trailing which is what was made it the oddest thing.  Best way to describe it is it looked like one of those fake flame fireplaces.  It went over the house.  We ran out front to look at it more.  It then stopped and went back towards the backyard and kept going off towards the north and just faded away. I t was not moving fast just cruising almost.  No noise, no other lights besides the orange/yellow brightness of the object.   12 people all leaving Thanksgiving Dinner witnessed this. I was able to get one picture.;42.2187;-71.5351
