At approximately 9:02 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on Sunday April 29th, 2012, a bright light appeared in the sky west of the border of Hopkinton, Massachusetts, on North Mill Street.  The light appeared to be a particularly bright star with other small glimmering lights underneath it and appeared to be approximately 40 degrees above a level horizon.  Approximately three of the smaller lights were present and glimmered with purplish, reddish, or greenish tones respectively.  The objects seemed to have a flowing but erratic motion with a small range, no more than a few degrees north and south and unknown degrees east and west. Approximately 40 minutes later, at around 9:45p.m., the position of the object had changed approximately 11.75 degrees Northbound and had stayed at the same approximate altitude and distance from my vantage point.  The smaller glimmering lights could not be accounted for at this point. At approximately 11:45 p.m. the object was no longer visible.  The object was not observed between the aforementioned times.
