Lake Maspenock sighting;2004-08-07 04:00:00;6min.;Lake Maspenock sighting I live on a lake on and I'm an early riser. That morning I was about to enter on to my deck to have morning coffee. Before exiting I noticed a a ray of light glistening on the lake ( like how a full moon would look). When I looked up I noticed a large star looking object just sitting there like a star would but it much lower a little over the tree tops. My first reaction was to get my digital camerea but for some reason couldn't. I watched for about 5 min aware of my surroundings mesmirized by the whole thing I did notice that it had a grayish circle like image in the center . Just when I started thinking to myself if it moves I will be frightened then it did leaving slowly towards my direction and exiting over my house.All I could think of You don't want me!!! It sounded like a distant jet. I havn't been able to think about anything since. I need to know if anyone else saw anything but I don't know how to go about it without looking ridiculos.I was a nonbeleiver but now I would be willing to be hypnotized and also take a lie dector test. Can't figure out why I DID'NT take this picure of a lifetime. I will have to live with it the rest of  my life.  Sincerely, ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.
