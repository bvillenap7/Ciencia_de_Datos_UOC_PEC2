On August  18, 2010- I was driving from Hudson, Ma 01749 towards Marlborough Ma 01752 on route #85 and had to stop for a red light adjacent to Stop and Shop.  I continued to look up toward the light  and at approximately 8:55.  at 10 o’clock on the sky a bright oval object appeared from nowhere (the sly was clear blue).  It moved from left to right in the sky for duration of 5 or 6 seconds.  It moved in a straight line parallel to the earth’s surface.  I watched it steadily until it ubruptly disappeared at about 2:30 o’clock.  There were no reflections on my windshield when this occurred.;42.3928;-71.5654
