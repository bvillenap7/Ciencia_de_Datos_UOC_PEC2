It flashed bright enough to leave a trail in my eyes after I closed them. I had 1 passenger and we both said, What the hell was that?  And agreed it moved awful strange and disappeared so fast it was not something we could explain.  Too close for a shooting star but looked just like one.  Right above my truck.  Then we felt really emotional over it...  With no explanation.;42.3928;-71.5654
