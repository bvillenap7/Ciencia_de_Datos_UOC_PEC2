Zero to top Speed Instantaneously;1983-10-01 20:00:00;20 seconds;Zero to top Speed Instantaneously It's been over 25 years ago so I can only estimate the year it happened to within 2 years.  Sometime between 1982 and 1984 I was driving out Route 2 every Friday night to Western MA to visit a friend in college, so I know it was not during the summer months.  One night I was the only car on the road in the Ayer area which is pretty rural alot of trees and some houses on a 2 lane divided highway.  In the distance straight ahead of me was a single white light in the sky.  It looked about a mile away about 3/4 up the windshield I was approching it at about 50 MPH with my lights on because it was dark outside.  The craft was just hovering in one place dead ahead of me as I approached.  All of a sudden it shot to the south (my left) at a speed that we are not capable of, maybe 10,000 MPH. Now heres the proof that I know it was not made by man, it did not need any distance to get up to speed.  It was like moving at top speed instantaneously. I have always wanted to know if anyone else ever saw it that night thats why I came to this site to look it up historically. I was not close enough to hear any sound ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));42.5594;-71.5739
