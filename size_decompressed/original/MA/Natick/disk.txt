This happened to me back when I was living with my grandmother sometime between 1985 and 1988.  The weather was good since I remember the car window being open.  I was on my way home to my grandmothers house driving my first car.  It was soon after the sun had gone down and it was getting pretty dark out.  To my left hovering over a large group of trees was a massive object in the sky.  It was hovering just high enough over the trees so I could see it from the road as I drove by.  I had lived in the area all my life and I knew that beyond the trees was a fairly small residential area where this object was hovering.  If I had to guess the object was saucer shaped...since the bottom part of it was covered by the trees and there were hundreds of bright multicolored lights all along the side/center of it.  If I had to guess, the length was probably that of a football field and was about as tall as a house.  It was probably about 200 yards from the road as well.  I dont know what prevented me from stopping and investigating but the image is still clear after almost 16 years.;42.2878;-71.3586999999999
