I was standing at my grill cooking as it was 4th of July (Independence day), chatting to two friends. My neighbor was walking his dog up the street.  He was really freaked out and exclaimed Excuse me, but am I seeing things or is that an airplane on fire?  We all looked up and there was this giant ball of fire moving across the sky. My heart just sank because it most certainly looked like an airplane on fire.  A raging fire really... and had a really strange orange glow to the flickering fire.  I was scared, all I could think of was horrible things happening aboard the plane.  It was moving at the speed of an airplane so it definitely was not a meteor or firework.  It was moving across in a mostly straight line but wobbling slightly, headed toward Logan Airport in Boston. By observing I got the vibe that it was obviously not normal.  Excited and frightened, I checked the news that night the next morning and the next few days but there was no report of an airplane fire or crash, etc.  This is not the first time I've seen a sighting here but it was certainly the most creepy.;42.2878;-71.3586999999999
