Diagonal bar of white/yellowish light under the cloud cover.;2012-03-02 20:00:00;10 seconds;Diagonal bar of white/yellowish light under the cloud cover It was really overcast that night but the clouds were illuminated by the moon. My friend and I were driving up Walnut Street in Natick and I saw one solid bar of light at a 45 degree angle under the clouds. The color was white with some yellow highlights, a small aura.  Very large, certainly not an airplane - especially since it was a bar of light, not blips. I don't know how low the cloud cover was but it was low because we were expecting snow within a day. I said to my friend stop the car & turn around, I see a UFO.  I kept looking back as he was driving and preparing to turn but it'd already disappeared.  The entire sighting length was approximately 10 seconds.  I have seen very similar objects in the area before. This area to Route 9 (1mi distance away) is somewhat of a hotspot.

16 lights (like stars) making a line flying over Natick Massachusetts  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-11 20:25:00;5 minutes;16 lights (like stars) making a line flying over Natick Massachusetts This evening when I got the dog to the backyard to do his business, the sky was clear and I was watching the stars...  then I noticed that one of the stars was moving... for a second I thought it could be a satellite.  Definitely not a plane because it was way too high.  All normal until I see the second, then the third and they didn’t stop coming from West to East... total were 16 lights flying in the sky, in a straight line, like 15 seconds apart from each other.  And probably there were more lights because probably I got the event in the middle... looked on the internet trying to find out what those lights were, but I couldn’t find anything.  Wondering if it was just me watching those... and where they were going once East from where I live is just Boston and then the ocean.  I’m intrigued.  Hope someone else saw the lights too and can explain them.  Thanks;42.2878;-71.3586999999999
