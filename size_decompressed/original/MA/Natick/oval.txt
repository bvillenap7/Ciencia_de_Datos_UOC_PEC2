i saw a silvery colored object in the sky...;2001-08-24 22:00:00;2 minutes;i saw a silvery colored object in the sky... ok , my friend and i were at memorial field in natick throwing the football around at night around 10:00, and when we were done we started walking home towards natick high school.  all of  a sudden out of the corner of his eye my friend said he saw some kind of weird thing in the sky, so i told him he was probly high.  and he was too.  so i looked for myself just to prove him wrong, and swear to god i actually saw it myself too!  the sky was fairly dark there were some lights around the area on the ground but i got a pretty clear view of things.  It lasted for about 2 minutes or so and what i saw was an elliptical or oval shaped object stationary and then it would dart around very fast and without any patterns.  it had purple lights on it and they were flashing on and off.  i couldnt believe what i was seeing, but i saw this silvery colored object and im not mistaken in my views.  I am a person of integrity and would not make this up im sure you guys get stupid people sending you made up stuff all the time, but this is real adn the reason i waited till now to say something is because i just found this website so thank you for providing an outlet for my thoughts and i hope this is valuable to you - dan ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
