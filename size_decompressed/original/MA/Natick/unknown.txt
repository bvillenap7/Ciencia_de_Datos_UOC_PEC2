I did not have his regular leash which is longer (for walking), this is just his go out and do your biz leash.  As I said, he bolted straight for the yard....when he got to the grass, from the pavement, he came to a complete stop....barked up a storm, his hair was up on end, and I could not calm him down for anything.  While I was startled by the running and the barking, I was oblivious to anything that might be about. But when he stopped, and I was ready to get down on him, and make him sit...I noticed/heard/felt...I have no idea.  I knew he had something in his field of vision that I only felt. My dog barked, jumped back a step, and then I saw it...I saw the eyes. I was frozen, incredulous...could not believe that I saw what I was seeing.  And being a member of MUFON, I was taken aback. This is my first report ever, and I have no understanding of what I saw, what it was or what will be explained to me.  All I know, is what I saw my dog see, pull, feel and then make me belive...is something I want someone to explain to me.

There were three smaller ones aligned in straight line vertically a bit distant from the big ship.  They stayed in the same position for about 45 minutes and then were gone. It was too far away to be captured by camera.;42.2878;-71.3586999999999
