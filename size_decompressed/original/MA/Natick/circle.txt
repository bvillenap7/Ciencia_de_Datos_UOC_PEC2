Silver orb hovering over town common.;2012-12-11 15:25:00;Few minutes;Silver orb hovering over town common A single silver orb floating in the sky at cloud level.  The sun was reflecting off of it and it remained stationary during the duration of me watching it.  It never changed or moved.  I turned down a road and my view became obstructed so I was not able to see the object anymore.  I teach preschool and have never seen anything like this before!;42.2878;-71.3586999999999
Sudden very bright fast-moving ball of white light disappeared and then a VERY low-flying aircraft/plane? showed up.;2017-11-11 03:30:00;40 seconds;Sudden very bright fast-moving ball of white light disappeared and then a VERY low-flying aircraft/plane? showed up. Around 3:30 AM this morning, a ball of light suddenly came from somewhere behind the trees in our yard.  It was bright enough to bring light through my window into my room and catch my attention from the corner of my eye as I was in bed.  From what I watched from my bed through the window, it traveled up and off to the right side of the sky and then I guess continued in that direction because I didn't see again after that.  It freaked me out, so it took me a few seconds to go over to the window.   When I looked out, there was then randomly what appeared to be a very low flying commercial airplane flying across the sky from right to left.  Though it seemed to have the typical lights of an airplane, the shape was a little bit off, like it was flying on it's side with one wing pointed down to the ground!  This was extremely bizarre because the giant flashlight-like ball of light had disappeared, and this airplane showed up from absolutely no where immediately after.   Also we are quite far from Logan airport, so an airplane flying low enough for me to distinguish it's individual lights and wings is extremely unusual and possibly even dangerous as well.   I've lived in this home for 20 years and I have never seen anything like this, let alone never once seeing an airplane flying so low to the ground above my neighborhood like this one.;42.2878;-71.3586999999999
