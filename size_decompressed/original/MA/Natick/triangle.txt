Completely silent, low flying almost translucent object.;2012-04-16 21:30:00;30 - 45 seconds;Completely silent, low flying almost translucent object. While trying to identify stars and constellations, the first observer was looking in the area of Arcturus or ESE of our observation point.  She remarked that she was seeing a triangular shape object approaching. I was looking a little closer to straight overhead, when I observed the same shape moving in a straight and level path.  It had a triangular shape, no lights, completely silent, and almost translucent.  I could see the shape, and track the movement but it was would seem to almost disappear for short moments.  I estimate it was no more than 3000 â€“ 5000 feet  above us and about the size of a jet observed from that distance.  We both followed it until it went out of view behind a house.  It was  a combination of the complete silence and translucent appearance that we both observed that makes this something we have never seen before.;42.2878;-71.3586999999999
Huge triangle shaped craft with bright dome on top gliding, no noise - scary!;2012-12-19 23:00:00;10-15 seconds;Huge triangle shaped craft with bright dome on top gliding, no noise - scary! Saw it in front of me in the sky as I was driving down Rte. 9 in Natick, MA - thought it was a plane but then realized it wasn't.   It was huge, flying low, kind of gliding, not fast, no noise.  Had red lights at each corner of the triangle on top was a bright dome with lights that looked like search lights shining out of it towards the sky.   Pulled over to watch, but it didn't last very long.;42.2878;-71.3586999999999

A triangular shaped craft emitted a white ball above jets.;2019-09-22 13:00:00;3 seconds;A triangular shaped craft emitted a white ball above jets. While  watching a video I took of fighter jets preparing to do a flyover at Gillette Stadium.  I noticed a triangular shaped craft above the jets.  There was also a white ball that seemed to have flown out of the craft at a high rate of speed, flying right to left over the fighter jets.;42.2878;-71.3586999999999
