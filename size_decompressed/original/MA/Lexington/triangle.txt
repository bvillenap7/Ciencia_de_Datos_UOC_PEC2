Triangular tumbling object with red grey shimmering light flying over highway 95 Lexington Mass morning May 6th 2011;2011-05-06 09:15:00;25 seconds;Triangular tumbling object with red grey shimmering light flying over highway 95 Lexington Mass morning May 6th 2011 Flying along side of highway 95 in Lexington Massachusettes was a triangular shaped, and metallic in color UFO.  One side seemed stretched.  It had a shimmering red grey light.  Had a tumbling pattern of movement but straight motions.  It changed directions in a fast movement unlike a plane.  Was about 500 hundred feet above ground.  If you had put a softball up to the windshield of my vehicle looking through the glass was the approximate size is the best way I can describe it.  I lost site of it above the tree line along side of the highway.  It was traveling East at the time.  Was very visible, and would be impossible for anyone driving on the highway at that time to not see this object also.;42.4413693877552;-71.2239244897959
