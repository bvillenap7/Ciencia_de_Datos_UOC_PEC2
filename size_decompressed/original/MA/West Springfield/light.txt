This light I spotted seemed to be making unusual movements or:  corkscrew movements.  I thought it may have been a trick of my viewpoint because I was walking my dog.  So I stopped to get perspective.  I looked for a Stobe light but didn't see one flashing.  Also, didn't see any colored lights on this object.  I did see a sideways sort of movement.  I didn't hear any noise such as I would have expected from a prop or jet engine. I don't believe it was a satellite.  I have seen satellites before and their movements are more straight lined than this objects.  If it was a plane I would guess it's height at  about 30 thousand feet.  It was heading in an easterly direction.;42.1177;-72.6444999999999

Then it just disappeared with no trace. No noises were heard, it was not a plane. The sky was very clear, as I could still see a visible bright star still in the eastern sky prior to the appearance of the UFO.;42.1177;-72.6444999999999
