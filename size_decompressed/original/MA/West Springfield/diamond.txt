On the night of August 26, 2010 at 20:25 pm I met my girlfriend outside my house.   Upon arrival, She called me on her cell (like she always does). While kissing my girlfriend goodnight, I noticed an unusually large and bright star-looking (diamond shaped), object   hovering in the Southeastern sky.  I stopped kissing my girl and told her to look up and tell me what she sees?  This is why I'm filing the report. It’s nothing strange to see a plane or even 5 or 6 of them I can see Westover AFB, A good part of the city of Chicopee (just over the Connecticut river) , But tonight is different, Clear and calm stars out and visible and then this object.  I thought it was nothing more than a satellite at first glance.  They move just a bit slower though. This object was the brightest thing in the night sky, and if I was to measure the thing, I estimate around  the size of an apartment building.  This light was intense.  It had height, width, and depth. My girlfriend and I watched this bright light move from the Southeast, toward the east for about a minute, and then it changed direction three separate times, almost a slow zig- zig.  Like it was crawling in the sky, then it moved faster toward the South, (heading over Springfield for about 4 more minutes?  We then saw what looked like jets going after this object, like it was trying to chase it.  The jets couldn’t keep up with it though, it proceeded to increase speed and then it was gone. I’ve seen some pretty explainable things in the sky at my home before, just nothing like this.;42.1177;-72.6444999999999
