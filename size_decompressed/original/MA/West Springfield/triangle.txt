White triangle with color balls in each corner, West Springfield.;2015-09-05 19:30:00;10-15 seconds;White triangle with color balls in each corner, West Springfield. A white triangle with different color balls of light in each corner (maybe blue pink and orange) had very thin poles connecting another triangle vertically, it seemed to be landing. I heard weird waves of sound after I couldn't see it anymore and then there were just aircraft noises.;42.1177;-72.6444999999999
