As I was driving along, the sun glinting off something metalic ahead of me a little above the tree line, caught my eye.  It did not seem to be any type of aircraft or anything I had ever seen before.  It was crescent shaped and skipped along horizontally to the right for about the length of two or three housetops and then receded into nothingness, much like the fin of a large fish might appear out of the water and then disappear as the fish descended deeper into the water. I remember saying to myself, What on earth was that?  I looked all around up in the sky ahead of me but could no longer see it.  Thinking about it immediately after as I was still driving, I came to the conclusion that what I saw was only part of a larger craft of some kind, perhaps a saucer or dsk, the edge of which appeared out of another dimension briefly and went back in.  I am very puzzled by this, but I saw what I saw straight ahead of me, clearly without any obstruction. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous.  PD));42.1177;-72.6444999999999

I saw what can best be described as a large metallic donut.  ((anonymous report));2019-06-03 18:00:00;1 minute roughly until I ;I was driving on Elm St. in West Springfield in daylight and I almost crashed my car.  I saw what can best be described as a large metallic vertical donut-shaped thing hovering about 400 feet above the road.  I had to do a double take because it didn't make any sense...it wasn't moving up or down or sideways' it was just stationary in the sky.  There were no strings or ropes or antennas coming off of it.   I don't know if there was sound because my radio was on and windows were up.
