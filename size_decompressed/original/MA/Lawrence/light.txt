I was there for like one hour just resting on the roofs floor and there it was a very stranged light across the clouds then it seams like it control the clouds beacuse a lot of red clouds formed in seconds after it was there and coverd it  you don't have trust in me but thats what was there!

Two bright lights moving in circular motion over Lawrence, MA.;2014-09-04 01:30:00;1 hour;Two bright lights moving in circular motion over Lawrence, MA. Could not sleep, went to living room looked up at the night sky and noticed two bright lights, that first appeared to be stars, then they started moving in circular motions, flashing.;42.7046786516853;-71.1633505617977
Solid orange lights moving across sky.;2014-09-04 20:30:00;10 minutes;Solid orange lights moving across sky. Witnessed orange lights slowly moving across the sky.   They would show up in pairs and travel across the sky for about 2 minutes before disappearing.   There were up to 6 in the sky at one time all traveling on the same path.;42.7046786516853;-71.1633505617977
Red star-like object moving in the sky. Two spotted twice and then 3 single ones after those.;2014-09-04 22:15:00;5 minutes;Red Star-Like object moving in the sky. Two spotted twice and then 3 single ones after those. A very clear evening and all stars could be seen.  2 Red moving balls of light that looked about the size of a bright big star.  The light did not flash. 5 different instances.  2 of these lights were spotted moving at a constant speed diagonal from each other maintaining spacing.  They eventually seemed to dim but appeared to be moving outward from the Earth and then disappeared quickly. almost instantaneously they reappeared in the same configuration in the opposite direction of where they were traveling but then seemed to travel the same path again. Then there was one at different plain moving about the same speed as the first 2 in the same direction.  As that one moved another one appeared at about the same plain but not exactly moving in the same direction.  Then a 3rd one appeared in the same way but all were on a similar plain but they were not right behind each other.  These moved at a speed that seemed slower than what a satellite seems to travel at when one goes over head.  It was not a plane because I was able to see several planes prior to and after this spotting.  The light were very visible on the planes and blinking could be seen.  It did not appear that the balls of red light were within Earths atmosphere.  I was in the military and I am a quality manager now so I generally get details very correct.  These were red and came from the west.  I would not expect anything to move in that manner even though it seemed to drift to the east.  They way they disappeared was unusual as well. I have seen flares and many things. I also witnessed this same ball of light about 2 weeks prior to this sighting but there were two of them in the east sky not moving much.  They stayed in one spot and one time drifted to east slightly, maintaining their configuration,  and then stopped.  They were there for about 3 minutes from time I spotted them.  They too disappeared quickly but seemed to moving away from the Earth because these drifted as they seemed to move away. I have some video but it looks just like a red star and nothing more on my phone camera video.;42.7046786516853;-71.1633505617977
