Kept flying at same level My husband and I were driving back into Boston, MA, on route 93s, when he pointed out a fireball heading towards us.  I looked up and it looked like a lit t-shape fork with the wings slightly tilted up at the ends, but completely covered with fire.  I could not believe it.  I almost stopped right there and then and almost caused an accident.   I pulled over by passing two lanes and parked on the emergency lane.  The object kept flying at the same level and headed left over us into what could have been Lowell/Lawrence area.  I was completely shocked.  This is the second time I see something in the sky that is completely rare to me and the people with me.  I tried to take a video/pic, but by the time I pulled over I only observed it for a few more seconds before it disappeared into the sky, meaning kept flying away from me.   I wonder if anyone else saw this? :/;42.7046786516853;-71.1633505617977
