strange bright orange light hovering in sky, fading in and out , same spot on multiple occasions, darted across sky;2004-02-11 20:00:00;15-20 minutes;strange bright orange light hovering in sky, fading in and out , same spot on multiple occasions, darted across sky it was about 8:00 pm on a wednesday and me and 2 other people were in on the second floor in a room watching tv and i noticed an orange light just hovering in the sky, appeared to close and too bright to be a star. this is the 3rd or 4th time ive seen this object in roughly the same place.the object generally has 2 or 3 planes in its general vicinity, sometimes appearing to head towards the craft only to pass under it. ive seen several other reports of strange hovering orange lights and that is the only reason im reporting this. the light generally hovers for 10-15 minutes sometimes changing intensity then disappears, without actually moving. i have seen the light move on one occasion , very slowly a couple of degrees in the sky then disappears. on the 11th of february we got in the car to pick up a friend from night school and the light was obstructed by trees when we saw what looked a shooting star of the same orangish color of the light flying overhead at a speed not possible for any aircraft ive ever seen, and if it was a meteorite, the odds of it coming from the same apparent direction as the light we saw are most likely astranomical.;41.7549;-70.7105
Bright star like object, then dimmed rather quickly but moved slowly.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Iridium satellite?  PD));2010-06-07 22:00:00;30 seconds;Bright star like object, then dimmed rather quickly but moved slowly A bright light as big as a star caught my eye but then slowly faded as it moved across the sky.  I have seen satellites many times before but this object becames suddenly bright then dimmed all in about 30 seconds directly above me.  It seemed very odd to me.  It was moving south to north slowly. About the speed of a satellite but dimmed quite quickly.  Again, it just seemed out of the ordinary.  It was white and out shined every other star at first. I'm sure other people saw it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Iridium satellite?

Looked as bright as Venus and was in between Venus and sister star. It paused directly between them then changed direction to the moon.;2017-03-16 05:49:00;3 minutes;Looked as bright as Venus and was in between Venus and sister star. It paused directly between them then changed direction to the moon.  Continued to the moon and washed out in the moon's light.  I waited for it to come out of the moon's light for 10 minutes. Nothing appeared to come out.;41.7549;-70.7105
