UFO fleet?  Hundreds of sparkling lights;2008-01-16 05:25:00;10 mins;UFO fleet?  Hundreds of sparkling lights My husband and I were on our way to the gym at 5:25 in the morning.  A flash of light in the eastern sky caught my eye.  When I looked up there were what looked like hundreds of flashing lights, almost twinkling, white and yellow.  We stood in the gym parking lot and watched it for about 10 minutes as they continued moving east and faded away.  It looked like hundreds of lights, flashing on and off.  Like a swarm.  I don't know if it was all lights coming on and off on one giant vehicle or hundreds of seperate vehicles traveling together.  It was east of us and over the cape.  There is an Air Force base there, but there jets are currently not flying.  This is definitely not jets.  We don't know what we saw, but it was huge.  I know we can't possibly be the only one to see this.  495 runs by here and anyone heading south on 495 at 5:20-5:30 am had to have seen it.;41.7549;-70.7105
We called 911 and reported this to the Bourne State police barracks. No way we were the only ones who saw this.;2009-09-19 19:53:00;30 seconds;We called 911 and reported this to the Bourne State police barracks. No way we were the only ones who saw this. While driving westbound on Rt 195 in Wareham, we saw what appeared to be a spotlight in the sky just off to the left of  the center of the windshield. I wondered why I didn't see any other lighting from what I thought must have been an airplane behind some mist but then I realized there were no clouds in the sky. There was no evident body of any aircraft supporting this light. The spotlight with a specific cone shape began to grow from some stationary position (distance not determined) and suddenly disappeared with an illuminating misty smoke left behind. We continued to drive west and realized we were not driving past the mist or whatever it was. We continued to drive toward it which made me realize how enormous this thing had to be since it was obviously miles above the earth and many miles away from us. I would guess that this took place over Buzzards Bay or even further. I have never seen anything like it. No way this was a satellite, plane or helicopter! . * Air Force base is East of incident in Falmouth, Mass ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));41.7549;-70.7105
