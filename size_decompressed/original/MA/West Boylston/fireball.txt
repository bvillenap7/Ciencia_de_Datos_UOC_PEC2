Orange-reddish fireball has repeatedly passed over our yard.;2014-09-15 18:00:00;5 minutes;Orange-reddish fireball has repeatedly passed over our yard. Three nights ago, we saw this same object pass over our yard, and last night we saw it twice.  Description is the same but event details are different.   Tonight we saw an orange fireball that flickered reddish and looked like an airplane on fire at first.  Didn't make any noise.  This evening it approached a bit slower than the other nights and then stayed in place for about 2 minutes.  It started to move again, about 90 degrees from how it approached but for the first time of the three nights did NOT pass right over our yard.  The fireball then flickered and went out.  None of us has ever seen anything like it. Last night (second event of three) it seemed as if the object had a rotating light emanating from it but it was hard to tell because the whole thing flickers somewhat. We tried to get a video but didn't have enough memory.  We'll try again tomorrow because it has come around the same time each (3) event.;42.3561;-71.7882
