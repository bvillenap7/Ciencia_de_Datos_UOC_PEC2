Bright Florissant-green, circular light arching downward with a trail of the same color.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor?  PD));2010-01-07 19:34:00;approx. 1 sec.;Bright Florissant-green, circular light arching downward with a trail of the same color, and dissappeared over West Boylston, MA. My daughter and I were traveling south on Route 12 in West Boylston, MA. @ 7:34pm.  We were going by Meolla’s Ice Cream stand and about a ¼ of a mile from a near by Wal-Mart when we saw a round, Florissant-green light arch downward with a trail of the same color light.  It was only visible for a second, but we both saw it at the same time.  Because we were in traffic we were unable to stop to ask if others saw it.  We were unable to come up with any explanations as to what it could be.  Though it just disappeared so fast, we looked for anything that would provide information or an explanation all the way in route to our home.  When passing the Wachusette Reservoir area we were even looking for signs of what we witnessed, but saw nothing.  However, there was an increase of air traffic, including a helicopter as we approached the town of Clinton, MA. on route 110 heading west.  This also seemed to be the direction of how the seen object arched. The event happened so rapidly that there was no time to take a photograph with a cell phone.  We will be watching the late news on TV tonight in an effort to find out if there were any reports regarding this sighting.;42.3561;-71.7882
