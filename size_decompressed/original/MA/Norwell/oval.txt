White ovoid traveling towards the South East.;2004-06-20 18:35:00;5 minutes;White ovoid traveling towards the South East. I was watching a 747 to the East of my position flying towards the North East when I glanced around and saw the object to the South East of my position, about 30 degrees above the horizon, moving slowly towards the South East.  With the naked eye it appeared to be a round point of white about the size of Venus.  Viewed through my 8x30 binoculars the object appeared to be ovoid in shape about twice as wide as it was high.  I lost track of the object when I went inside to get a higher power pair of binoculars. The weather was lightly cloudy and the sun was to my back as I viewed the object.  I could not estimate the distance to the object and there were no clouds close enough to it to tell whether it was above or below the altitude of the clouds. There was no noise which I could link to the object. I have a B.S. in natural resources, I live near a corridor for airliners flying North to Logan Airport, I grew up near the South Weymouth NAS and am familiar with aircraft.;42.1591;-70.8163
