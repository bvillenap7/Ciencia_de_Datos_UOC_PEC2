3 orange spheres/orbs flying in succession due east toward ocean, no sound;2014-10-09 19:55:00;8 minutes;3 orange spheres/orbs flying in succession due east toward ocean, no sound As I was driving down my road, I noticed an orange light (resembling flames) in the sky.  I turned around and went back and parked in my driveway, where I observed 3 orange spheres or orbs flying east.  They made no sound and the light was steady.  They were flying in succession, not together.   The total time of observation was 8 minutes.  I attempted to get a video of it on my iPhone but it's not the best quality.;42.1591;-70.8163
