strange light, stat. in the sky, Blinking from different sides, fading in and out.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly Venus.  Not a UFO.  PD));2010-06-18 23:46:00;3 hours;strange light, stationary in the sky, Blinking from different sides, fading in and out. Watching a Light in the sky every night for four nights.  Same place every night seems like a blinking star at first glance but as You watch it appears to blink from different side's.  Witnessed this the first night alone, Second night I asked my husband to have a look also.  He also thought this was different from a star. Third night same place and was witnessed by the two of us.  The fourth night (tonight) I tried to get it on film, The light is hard for my camera to see due to the distance, But I was able to get a short film.  I wondered if it could have been a satellite, but from my understanding, satellite's don't have light's and can appear when the sun reflects off of them,  This object appeared to have light's blink in and out and from the side's, sometimes getting bright then dimming. thought It may interest someone.
