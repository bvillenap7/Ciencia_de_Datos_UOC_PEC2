View of sky occluded as an object passed overhead.;2007-08-12 03:15:00;20 Seconds;View of sky occluded as an object passed overhead. I had gone out early in the morning to view the Perseids on Sunday morning.  This was the day before peak times but there where still some thought that the display would be worthwhile. After setting up my chair and positioning myself to look towards the east northeast section of the sky.  I was watching towards this direction when I noticed the stars over me being occluded from view.  I watched this dark spot travel from over my head to the south-east portion of the sky when it left my viewable area. The closest shape I could possibly assign to this experience would be a long somewhat rectangular shape. I have been hesitant to report this since I had no one with me to collaborate my experience.  I have tried to find something to account for this but after being an amateur astronomer for over 30 years, I am at a lost for what it was. Thanks!;41.9739;-71.3284
