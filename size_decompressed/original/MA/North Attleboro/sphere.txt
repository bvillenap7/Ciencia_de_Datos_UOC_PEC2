The sky was very clear and we could see the object above a neighbors house, it was moving to the South.  It made no noise, had white lights that rotated around the sphere clockwise.  We could see the shape of the object against the black sky.  My brother and three friends followed the object to a  road outside of Providence. It stopped and they stopped.  It was directly above them and they could clearly see hyroglyphic-type writing on the shiny metalic surface - they were that close!  My brother took pictures and the object began to move again.  They were terrified and returned home. Only he was actually gone for hours longer than they can account for.  He won't talk about any of this to anyone.  He pretends it didn't happen but my family and I know what we saw! When the film was developed, all non-UFO  pictures developed normally but the UFO photos were all overexposed yet he used no flash and the pictures were taken at night.  Quite a few others saw this UFO that evening and everyone I have spoken with agrees with my description.  An investigator (from where I don't remember) came to our house and spoke with everyone individually and we drew pictures of the object.  I haven't seen one since but I check the skys nightly!
