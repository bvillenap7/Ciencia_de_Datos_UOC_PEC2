3 triangular objects with green lights, making no sound, heading east over Welfleet drive-in.;1996-08-15 22:00:00;30 minutes;3 triangular objects with green lights, making no sound, heading east over Welfleet drive-in. My husband and I were at the Wellfleet drive-in and were standing outside the car stretching our legs.  We were looking up at the stars and observed a dark, triangular shaped object the size of at least a half dollar held out at arms length.  This object made no sound and had a green light on the nose and 3 green lights along each side.  This object moved smoothly, soundlessly over the drive in heading off to the southeast towards Provincetown, MA.  Once this object moved out of our sight, it was followed by 2 other objects identical in size,shape, with the same lights, making no sound, following the same path as the one previous.   Since we were the only onces standing outside of our car, I don't know if there were any other witnesses. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));41.9283;-70.0236
