I kept looking closer because I had never seen these lights from my window before, despite the fact I’ve looked out this window for 25 years of my life.  I didn’t want to pay too much attention, but after looking at it for ten minutes and looking through several different windows to make sure it wasn’t something on my glass pane, I realized it was a flying object.  My windows were kind of foggy but it looked like a giant metal Platform in the sky with two huge lights which slightly Illuminated it I’m the night sky.  What shook me was how it stayed perfectly still mid air hovering in the sky.  Even though this was obviously a massive space craft, it did not show any effects of gravity in the sky.  It stayed hovering at a couple hundred feet from 1am-4am.  When I looked again at 6am, the spacecraft was gone.  It might sound stupid, but I didn’t take a picture because I thought it might attract unwanted attention from whatever was up there at the moment.;42.1926999999999;-73.3606
