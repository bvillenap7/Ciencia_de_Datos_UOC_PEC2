UFO on Simon's Rock campus.;2018-04-13 01:30:00;>30 minutes;ufo on simon's rock campus My friend and I were walking back to our apartment on the Simon's Rock campus at about 1:30 am, when we noticed that what we thought was an unusually bright star to the southeast was moving.  We assumed it was a plane, so we stopped to look at the sky, and the light went out.  When it came back, it was dilating and continued to move.  We thought it was funny, so we kept watching it, and it started to change and move in the opposite direction.  It went sideways and hovered in place, which was when we became pretty certain that it wasn't a plane or a satellite.   Two other people walked up to us and confirmed that the light was moving weirdly...  All four of proceeded to stand in place, looking at the light, and during this time, it mostly stayed stationary, but started blinking erratically, growing larger and smaller.   At one point, it started to move again, and then stopped several feet higher than it had been.  The blinking could've been clouds, and sometimes clouds did pass over, but we could tell that it wasn't a star, because the other stars around it became dimmer under cloud cover, except for the light.  My friend and I watched it for awhile, but then decided to go to bed.;42.1926999999999;-73.3606
