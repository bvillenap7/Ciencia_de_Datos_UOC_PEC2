Bright pure white cone of light, not moving, over northwestern Connecticut, for about 20 sec.. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));2009-09-19 19:52:00;30 seconds;Bright pure white cone of light, not moving, over northwestern Connecticut, for about 20 seconds While watching the stars (as I do each evening with my son), I noticed a very bright, pure white light due south of our location. It was approximately 40 degrees above the horizon, and looked like a light shining down on the Earth -- that is, it was shaped like a cone, brightest at the top and fading out at the lower edge, which was about 5-10 degrees lower. Several things struck me about this event. First, it was very large, covering several degrees of the sky horizontally and vertically. Second, the apex of the cone was flattened, as you would see if someone were shining a flashlight down -- it wouldn't come to a perfect point, it would be flat at the rim of the flashlight. Third, it did not move at all -- at first it reminded me of a comet, but I knew that couldn't be, and then a meteor, but that would be true only if it were coming straight at me (which is possible). I turned to the screen door and called for my wife to come see. When I turned back, ther! e was only a luminescent cloud where the light had been shining. My wife, exiting another door, confirmed this. Could it have been a meteor coming head-on at us? That's the best explanation I can come up with.  There were commercial aircraft in the vicinity, what I believe was regular westbound traffic from Logan or Bradley airports. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));42.1926999999999;-73.3606
I was walking back from volleyball practice on my campus, the patch of trees in between a river and my campus faculty building suddenly;2017-04-13 22:00:00;10 seconds;I was walking back from volleyball practice on my campus, the patch of trees in between a river and my campus faculty building suddenly lit up from above for roughly 10 seconds, almost as bright as if it were daytime.   Once the light went out, I went into the patch of trees to investigate and had the overwhelming feeling that I was being watched from all directions.   I ended up losing 3 minutes (I checked my watch several times because I needed to make curfew).   The next morning I woke up with a bleeding hole in my neck, as if I'd been bitten by a horsefly, and it was painful to touch. ((NUFORC Note:  We have e-mailed a request to the witness, requesting that she have the wound on her neck photographed.  PD));42.1926999999999;-73.3606
