While walking my dog, I noticed a bright broad light behind clouds. I thought it was the moon on a very cloudy night.  Than I noticed it was opposite where the moon would have been at that time. It got very bright  A few minutes later. The dog and I were diagonally across from our house.  All of a sudden many transparent green balls of light shot out and drifted down from the bright light very slowly  dissipating well before it came in contact with a tree line.  The bright light in back of the clouds disappeared and I returned home describing what I saw to my wife when she told me the cape cod times had many reports of sightings that week.  I will never forget these few moments.  Approx a few days or week later a coast guard helicopter landed about a tenth of a mile from location ( very weird location for it to have landed on land adjacent to Parkers River.  Could not find out any reason for them to have been landed at night at this strange location on Main Street on Rt 28 South Yarmouth there were a few people that pulled over because it was so odd to see such a large craft land in a tiny area. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));41.6721;-70.1941
