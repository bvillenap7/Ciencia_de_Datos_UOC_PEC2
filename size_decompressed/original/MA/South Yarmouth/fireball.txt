I noticed a bright orange and white ball of light silently moving across the sky from west to east.  My wife and I went outside and listen and the object did not make a sound. It just moved at a fairly fast and steady pace.  It went past the the horizon and then about ten minutes later i heard the low rumble of jets off go over the house.
