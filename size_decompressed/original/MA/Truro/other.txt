Straight line of black smoke crosses sky;2007-08-22 15:00:00;3 minutes;Straight line of black smoke crosses sky While sitting on the beach at Truro my friend and I were looking up at the clouds and both noticed this odd dark line of black smoke or cloudiness in contrast to the white puffy clouds above.  This straight line of black smoke moved purposely below the white clouds, almost like a shadow, in the opposite direction that the wind was blowing.  We both noted the strangeness of it.  It finally disappeared after covering a portion of the sky.  We also saw circular holes in the clouds above this black smoke/cloud but no craft or visible object.;42.0005;-70.0589
