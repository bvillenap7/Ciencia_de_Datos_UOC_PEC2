Hovering box-like UFO spotted in Eastern Mass.;2009-02-16 23:05:00;3 mins;Hovering box-like UFO spotted in Eastern Mass. At approximatly 11:05 on February 16 2009, I was sitting in my friends car at a dead end looking out onto a dark and open field. It started out looking like a bright starcoming from the North-West.  Then I noticed it was getting closer and then it changed into 3 multi-colored lights, rite in a row. As it got closer it looked more like a box or building like shape.  It had a bright white light in the middle and the same multi-colored lights on its outside.  It came closer and closer until it was right over us. Thats where i saw it looking up. It looked more like a triangle/box shape. Thats when I got out of the car and heard a hovering like sound.  We started the car and tried to follow this unidentified flying object but ended up loosing it shortly.  Then at 11:16 saw a similar UFO going in the same North-West direction.  Ive never seen anything like this.;42.0249;-71.0951
