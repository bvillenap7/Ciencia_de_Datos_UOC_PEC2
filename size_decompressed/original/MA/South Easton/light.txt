I stepped outside my side door of my house (facing South) to take my dogs outside at EXACTLY 9:49pm. I immediately saw a VERY bright white light in the sky left of me with a pointy tail following it that was an electric blue color (like a blue colored flame from a gas stove). I couldnt help but follow the the bright white light with my eyes that went straight across the sky in front of me from left to right. There was no angle to its flying. No upward direction, no downward direction-just straight across the sky PERFECTLY from left to right. There was no smoke behind its blue tail. Then in a split second I lost sight of it behind a VERY large tree in my yard. My first thoughts were Wait! what are you?! I ran behind my large tree to see if I could still see the bright white light with the electric blue tail but it was completely gone. During this whole time there was no sound when I saw this bright white light fly across the sky in front of me. After I lost sight of it I looked straight up and saw a large jet flying in the Eastern direction and I could just barely hear its engine sound soaring through the skies. I immediately ran inside the house to tell my husband. He unfortunately did not see it.;42.0249;-71.0951
