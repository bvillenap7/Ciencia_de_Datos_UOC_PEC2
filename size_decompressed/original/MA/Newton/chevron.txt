I noticed them for about 5 seconds then they disappeared. I was driving to work on Route 128 South, in Massachusetts, at about 1:30 pm on the above date.  I saw, in the shy, what I thought was a commercial airliner either ready to land or crash onto the highway on which i was driving.  I did not notice any airplane like features, but the thought, my god, this plane is going to crash was what came into my mind.  At that instant the lights disappeared completely.  I dont think i heard any sounds, i cant say for sure.  I know other people saw it because i saw them slow down and their brakelights come on.  a jeep travelling to my left almost caused an accident.  The lights were side by side going up diagonaly and coming down diagonaly like an upside down V, but the V was more elongated and not as pointed.  the lights were a very light amber.  I am not sure if it was 6 crafts or one craft with six lights.  i cant say for sure.  I called my wife on my cell phone and told.  I think she believed me, but I called her back and said i think it would be best if she said nothing.  Thats all i can say.
