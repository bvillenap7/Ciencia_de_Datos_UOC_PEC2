At 3:50 PM Clear blue skys in Newton, Massachusetts USA.  I witnessed a circle of bright white light similar to that of a star.  I was facing South West observing the course of the UFO for an estimated 10 seconds.   The object headed from my left to my right before it faded away and created a trail of white light which lasted only for an instant.   I stress the brightness of this object.  It was no less brighter than that of a star at night. ((NUFORC Note:  Date above is corrected.  PD));42.353303030303;-71.1856
