Observed a pulsating light traveling at a high rate of speed.;2000-03-30 22:00:00;3 minutes;Observed a pulsating light traveling at a high rate of speed. While driving on North St. in Newton, I observed a pulsating white that that had a look similar to a strobe light traveling south to north at a high rate of speed. The sighting lasted approx. 3 min before the light disappeared behind some trees..;42.353303030303;-71.1856
Dull orange lights flying in a line over Newton Mass;2012-05-18 10:15:00;5 minutes;Dull orange lights flying in a line over Newton Mass I was walking with a neighbor to another neighbors house and I saw an orange light flying over head, much like an airplane would.  It looked like a rusty dull orange light.  It moved in a straight line from the south west to the northeast at about fifteen thousand feet. It was no more than a mile from us.  It made no sound and moved slowly and wobbled a bit from side to side like a train on a track.  I said to my neighbor &quotwhat the heck is that&quot to which he replied &quotweird&quot.  Then another appeared from the horizon and followed the exact same flight path as the first.  At that point five other neighbors asked what the lights were.  We saw another orangish light follow the exact same path, and I mean without any deviation.  As the third light flew over a commercial airliner flew over the light and we heard the sound of its engines as it passed.  Then another light followed the others in the same flight path but moved vary fast as if to catch! up.  We are both attorneys and skeptics.  Whatever we saw were not conventional aircraft.  We video taped the objects but they appear as a dot of light which isn't very revealing.  But the sighting was very interesting.

Slow moving object, SE direction, definitely not a star, aircraft, or satellite.;2014-12-26 05:00:00;5 minutes;Slow moving object, SE direction, definitely not a star, aircraft, or satellite. Slow moving object in the sky, appeared as a star, but didn't flash like a star usually does.  Was moving in a SE direction.  Also wasn't flashing like an aircraft.;42.353303030303;-71.1856
Spherical flashing stationary white light followed by dimmer red light, xtremely fast speed & zig-zag path.;2016-11-03 05:50:00;1-2 minutes;Spherical flashing stationary white light followed by dimmer red light, xtremely fast speed & zig-zag path Bright white round light about 3x-5x the size of brightest aircraft lights, alternatively flashing and solid but stationary, then switched to red lights similar to aircraft but extremely fast travel and a flight path that had a very sharp zig-zag and then continued out of sight.  Jaw dropping.  Assuming a highly capable military drone but just wondering if anyone else saw anything.;42.353303030303;-71.1856
