White nosed cylinder with a greenish flame over Rt 128.;2015-11-01 17:05:00;15-20 seconds;White nosed cylinder with a greenish flame over Rt 128. I was driving on Rt 95N (aka 128) between Rt 9 and the Mass Turnpike (RT.90) when I saw a cylinder with a greenish flaming trail flying very fast in the sky from east to west.   The nose looked like the our spaceships as they re-enter our atmosphere burning white hot.  It was just above the horizon going very fast but not too high.   Only for 15 to 20 seconds, then it appeared to go pouf in the sky.;42.353303030303;-71.1856
