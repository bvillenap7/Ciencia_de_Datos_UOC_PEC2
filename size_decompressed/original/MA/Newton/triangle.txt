Triangle shaped craft 8:10 pm Eastern standard Time low flying  green, red blinking lights.;2012-12-13 20:10:00;7-10 minutes;Triangle shaped craft 8:10 pm Eastern standard Time low flying  green, red blinking lights I was walking home and I saw at first what looked like triangular blinking Christmas red and green lights.  Then I realized it was in the sky and I thought it was a very low flying triangular plane. We don't have a military base, and I've never seen a plane this  low flying (Apart from airport) or triangular almost Ouija shaped.  I don't believe in aliens, but this was definitely an unidentified flying object(UFO).  It hovered in the sky without a sound.I thought because of the lights I could use my iPhone,but the 4 photos I took didn't come out.  I heard a helicopter behind me, but kept looking at the weird UFO. It hovered for a minute more and then disappeared.  Not sure  though, could have flown out of view fast.;42.353303030303;-71.1856
