strange lights;2007-05-08 02:00:00;approx one year;For approximately one year, I have been noticing strange lights in the sky at night. The first time I noticed these lights, there was only one light. At first it appeared to be an ordinary star. The longer I observed it the more I began to notice the irregularities. The first oddity I noticed was that the “star” was blinking. Secondly, it was moving rapidly in the sky, back and forth. I jokingly called it my ufo and continued to try to find it at night. 	At that time, although I had no explanation for its peculiar appearance, I had no reason to believe that it could be anything but a star. After about 5-6 months or observation, I started to notice more of these strange stars. Again I assumed that there was a scientific and rational explanation. 	5-8-2007, I happened to see these blinking lights in the sky again. There were at least three of them. Most significantly, these lights had started to change colors. 	I don’t know if I believe in aliens and ufos or not. I would however like to know your opinion on the events.    Thank you;41.9718;-71.1894
Bright light Moving south to north. It was to the west of Norton and Mansfield Massachusetts;2012-10-23 19:15:00;6 seconds;Bright light Moving south to north. It was to the west of Norton and Mansfield Massachusetts Sitting on outside deck. Dark with high cloud cover.  A Light, from my veiw point about the size of an eraser head, moving form south to north.  I sit outside most nights and have a cigar.  If I look up at about a 45 to 90 degree angle I can watch with much frequency the flight paths of jets to Logan Airport and small aircraft comming and going to Mansfield airport.  I mention this to stress the fact that I know what a plane or jet looks and sounds at night and how it moves.  This light moved very quickly and smoothly and made absolutely no noise.  It was very controlled and I was able to watch it for about 5 to 6 second before it disapeared.  Not enough time to really detail it, but enough time to know it was not a jet, plane or meteor.;41.9718;-71.1894

Single light like a star moving in a straight slightly zig-zagging line across the sky. No other lights and way to fast for a plane. Se;2020-05-30 22:00:00;20 minutes;Single light like a star moving in a straight slightly zig-zagging line across the sky.  No other lights and way to fast for a plane.  Seemed to flare a little and change color before fading out.  There were three almost one after another traveling north to south and a few minutes later a forth traveling in the opposite direction;41.9718;-71.1894
