Hang-glider or flying wing shaped aircraft that was solid black silently flew overhead on a clear and sunny Saturday.  There was no jet trail behind the craft.  There were no lights seen on the craft.  It was flying as high as commercial jets fly and it was approximately 1-1/4” at arm’s length.   The craft smoothly moved from east to west.
