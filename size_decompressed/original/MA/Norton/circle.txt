Ufo flyover on a partly cloudy night;2010-05-16 00:14:00;less than a min.;Ufo flyover on a partly cloudy night (time I went outside 11:30) I had decided to go look at the stars last night, since other than random cloud cover I could see the stars clearly every five or ten minutes.  I went outside and set up a blanket and a pillow out back and turned all the lights out.  After about half an hour of clouds rolling in and breaking up I finally got a perfectly clear view of the sky.  As I turned myself to face more towards the clear patch of sky which eventually expanded to a completely clear sky. Five minutes after the clouds cleared out I saw it.  The UFO or what ever it was was too high up to get a clear view of what it actually looked like besides an orangery light with a yellow and green strobe.  It moved from about middle of my view towards the north in erratic patterns.  It traveled north east quickly turned 90 degrees on a dime for about 4 seconds then turned back on its original course.  It finally disappeared over my treeline.  I have never seen a commercial airliner or a jet fly like this and im quite sure what i saw was not a falling satellite or some sort of space junk entering the atmosphere.  My only regret was that i didn't have a camera as evidence of what i saw.;41.9718;-71.1894
