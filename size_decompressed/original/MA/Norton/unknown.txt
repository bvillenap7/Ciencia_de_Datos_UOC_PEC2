December 2009 UFO Crash in Norton/Attleboro, MA area During Snow Storm.;2009-12-17 21:00:00;10 seconds;December 2009 UFO Crash in Norton/Attleboro, MA area During Snow Storm It’s hard to say what it was, it could have been a meteor, a ufo.  It could have been a rectangle, square or round, I don’t know.  It appeared round because it was falling and had a greenish, yellowish, whitish orb and tail around it. 100% if was not flying across the sky, I have seen many a shooting star and this was close, in our atmosphere and crashed somewhere probably near the Norton, Attleboro line.  We saw it go from the sky, get bigger and closer and it was heading directly to the ground.  There is a small regional airport in Norwood, MA, it was not a plane, you would not have been able to see a plane in that storm and this object was very clear and broke through the clouds at a speed that small planes cannot get to.  It also very clearly hit the ground, we saw it go below the trees...no fireball, nothing like that, not plane crashes reported. What I want to know is did anyone else see this object, this bright glowing object falling to the ground in Norton, MA, on December of 2009 during the snowstorm.  My then girlfriend and I saw it. Both of us had never seen a UFO before.  I assume all UFO’s are government crafts, don’t really believe in aliens, but I’ve been proven wrong before.  All I know is that we had clear minds, were in the act of falling in love and both audibly were shocked by the object that we saw crash to earth.  We both said well, that must be a meteor, but who knows.  It was soooooo bright someone, someone, a plow driver, someone must have seen it too.
