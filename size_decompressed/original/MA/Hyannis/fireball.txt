Two red/orange fireballs over Nantucket Sound seen from Hyannis.;2014-08-03 21:45:00;2 minutes;Two red/orange fireballs over Nantucket Sound seen from Hyannis. At about 9:45 pm, our adult daughter noticed something in the sky that looked like a red/orange fireball.   We all (four adults) looked and spotted a second one that looked like the first one.  They were both far up in the sky, moving rapidly, in a northeast direction.   We watched for about two minutes, until we werenâ€™t able to spot them any longer, probably due to the hazy conditions.;41.6551;-70.2945
