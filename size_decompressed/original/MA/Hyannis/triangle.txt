MY WIFE AND I WERE COMING HOME FROM HER PARENTS HOUSE FROM DINNER.  WE TURNED ONTO THE END OF OUR STREET AND WERE PROCEEDING TO OUR HOME.  AS I WAS DRIVING, MY WIFE SAID TO ME LOOK AT THOSE LIGHTS, I DIDN'T KNOW THEY HAD PUT UP TRANSMISSION TOWERS NEAR HERE.  I LOOKED UP AND SAW WHAT SHE WAS REFERRING TO, BUT IT WASN'T RIGHT.  I STOPPED THE CAR AND GOT OUT TO LOOK AND SHE SEEMED TO GET VERY UPSET AND ASKED ME TO GET BACK IN RIGHT AWAY.  MY WIFE AND I WERE NOT THE ONLY ONES TO SEE THIS, THERE WAS ANOTHER CAR BEHIND US ABOUT 50 YARDS, AND THEY TOO STOPPED AND GOT OUT OF THEIR VEHICLE. WHEN I LOOKED UP AFTER MY WIFE HAD MADE HER COMMENT I SAW TWO RED LIGHTS BLINKING.  THE TWO LIGHTS WERE BLINKING EXACTLY AT THE SAME TIME, AS IF THEY WERE BOTH HOOKED UP TO THE SAME CIRCUIT.  THAT IN ITSELF I THOUGHT WAS STRANGE.  AND I ALSO KNEW THAT THERE WAS ABSOLUTLY NO WAY THAT ANY TOWERS COULD HAVE BEEN CONSTRUCTED WITHOUT US KNOWING ABOUT IT.  THESE LIGHTS WERE NOT THAT FAR AWAY.  THEY WERE DIRECTLY OVER HEAD AT ABOUT 200'.  THE FIRST ONE WAS PROBABLY 200' HIGH AND 300' IN FRONT OF ME.  IT WAS DARK OUT AND I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT I WAS LOOKING AT ONE OBJECT WITH TWO LIGHTS ON IT.  THE SECOND LIGHT WAS ABOUT THE SAME HEIGHT = 200' HIGH AND PROBABLY 500' OR 600' AWAY.  ALL I COULD THINK WAS HOW INCREDIBLY LARGE THIS THING WAS.  I STILL THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY ONE OBJECT.  THAT WAS BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE LIGHTS WERE BLINKING, EXACTLY AT THE SAME TIME.  AS I WAS STANDING THERE, THE FARTEST LIGHT ZOOMED UP, RIGHT NEXT TO THE OTHER ONE.  THEY MADE NO NOISE, AND THEY BOTH HAD SAT STILL FOR A WHILE.  THEN THEY WENT OVERHEAD AND TO MY RIGHT.  THEY GAINED SPEED AND ALTITUDE AND WERE GONE.  NO NOISE, NOTHING.  WHILE THEY WERE OVERHEAD, I SAW THAT THEY WERE TWO OBJECTS, NOT ONE.  AND I ALSO SAW THAT THEY WERE TRIANGULAR IN SHAPE.  I'M STILL NOT SURE EXACTLY OF THE SIZE.  I'M STILL WONDERING WHAT I SAW.  MY WIFE ALSO SAW ALL OF THIS TOO.  AT THE TIME I KNEW A MAN THAT WORKED IN THE CONTROL TOWER AT THE AIRPORT HERE.  I CALLED! HIM UP AND TOLD HIM WHAT I SAW AND ASKED HIM IF HE HAD SEEN ANYTHING ON HIS RADAR.  HE SAID THAT HE SAW ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, WHICH MADE ME THINK THAT I DID INDEED SEE SOMETHING VERY OUT OF THE ORDINARY.  I AM JUST GLAD THAT MY WIFE WAS WITH ME AND SAW THE SAME THING I DID OR I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT I WAS GOING CRAZY. MY WIFE FELT SO STRONGLY ABOUT THE STRANGNESS OF THIS THAT SHE CALLED THE LOCAL AIR BASE.  THEY KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT.  HAD I KNOWN SOONER, I WOULD HAVE REPORTED THIS INCIDENT, BUT I DIDN'T KNOW OF YOUR ORGANIZATION.  SINCE I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE I THINK THIS WAS A ONCE IN A LIFETIME SITUATION.  THANK YOU.  ((name deleted));41.6551;-70.2945
Silver, triangular/oval, l huge obj., moving from N to S, over Route 6 in Hyannis, MA, right over the highway, low and at a slow pace.;2003-08-10 11:00:00;20 seconds;Silver, triangular/ova,l huge object, moving from N to S, over Route 6 in Hyannis, MA, right over the highway, low and at a slow pace. On August 10, 2003, a Sunday, my husband and I were traveling back from Cape Cod, Mass. to our home in New York.  As usual, we were stuck in traffic on Route 6, and it was bumper-to-bumper, but this was more traffic than usual and we were stuck from the bridge back to the Hyannis area, which is some 5-6 miles away from the bridge that takes you off Cape Cod.   As we were sitting in traffic, all of a sudden, from the north and moving south, my husband and I saw a huge, somewhat triangular/almost oval, silver object moving at a slow pace over the highway.  Everyone who was stuck in traffic at that location and on that date would have seen it too.  There were no wings, no jets, no propellers, and no obvious means of propulsion.  It was moving at a steady pace, and my husband and I both saw it.  We have been talking about this for years but I did not know there was a place to report it.  This morning I checked my journals to find the exact date and found it in one of my journals, with a date of August 10, 2003, a Sunday, which is consistent with the day we travel back home -- a Sunday.   My husband and I are both educated and I'm an attorney.  I'm also a writer, and consider myself to be an accurate reporter.  This is what I wrote in my journal, in addition to what I wrote here.  I said:  Oh my God, look at that.  My husband saw it, too, and we were both incredulous.  We both said that no one would believe us.  We made sure that each of us had seen it, and we confirmed that each of us had indeed seen it.  There were no windows to be seen and no occupants to be seen.  It was a huge, silver object moving at a slow pace over the highway and not more than several hundred feet above us and slightly in front of us -- not directly overhead.  My husband first thought it might be some kind of weather balloon but he realized that that was impossible because it looked nothing like a balloon.   We have talked about this for years, but have not known where to report this.  When I found this site last night, I wanted to lo! ok for my journals to find the exact date that we saw this.  I found my journal and my entry for this date, and, indeed, I had written about this incident in my journal, describing the moving object, where it was, what it looked like, and how my husband and I were hoping we hadn't seen what we had just seen.   The event took approximately 20 seconds.  I wish I had had my camera out, but I didn't, and wasn't able to get it in time.  This was in the morning, it was a sunny day, the sky was clear, and it was visible in clear daylight around 11:00 a.m..  There was no way to mistake what we saw because the sky was clear, it was daylight, and it was a bright, sunny day.;41.6551;-70.2945

Dark Red Sharks Tooth shaped UFO over Hyannis.  Flew across night sky in 5 seconds;2016-06-01 22:11:00;2-3 minutes;Dark Red Sharks Tooth shaped UFO over Hyannis.  Flew across night sky in 5 seconds On the night of June 1, 2016, I was walking out of an appointment and like usual, I looked up at the beautiful Cape Cod sky peppered with thousands and thousands of stars.  Then 2 things caught my eye, an airplane (most likely a Cessna 402 ) and a dark red light in the shape of a Sharks Tooth with a single white light in the center.  The Airplane and UFO were in the same vicinity for about 15 seconds…it almost seemed like the Sharks Tooth was following the aircraft.  So the plane was approx. 2-3000 ft and climbing, whilst the Triangle was maybe 2-300 feet below the Airplane.   The Sharks Tooth suddenly accelerated and as the Twin Propeller airplane was climbing slowly, the Dark Red Triangle went from my 5 o’clock (counterclockwise) to my 10 o’clock in about 5 seconds and just disappeared into the early summer night.  And just like that it was gone, but that plane was still climbing, it was kind of funny.  So the craft was a triangle shape, but with long-sides ( k! inda like a sharks tooth).  I think I was lucky in that I had a reference in the airplane, I can 100% say that it was not an airplane.;41.6551;-70.2945
