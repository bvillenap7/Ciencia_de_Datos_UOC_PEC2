boomerang sliver shiny shaped object;1994-06-05 19:00:00;1:00 min;boomerang sliver shiny shaped object As I was driving to work in the eary morning around 7 am I was heading down a street towards the water,no other cars or people were around.  When I came to a stop sign I looked towards the water which was directly in front of me.   To my amazement, I also looked up to see a shiny boomerang shaped object it was sliver and shiny, huge it was.....just hovering above the water there were beach houses all around it looked like it was partially over a house.  I rolled down my window expecting to hear something or waiting for it to move,  But nothing no noise or movement what so ever it just hoovered, I couldn't believe what I was seeing I wanted to shout out to anyone but not a soul was around.I sat there for about a minute and slowly drove on watching it for as long as I could,I have never told anyone about this except a close friend.  I scoured the newspapers for anyone else seeing this but there was never anything. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));41.6551;-70.2945
