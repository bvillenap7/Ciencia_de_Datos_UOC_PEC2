About every minute there would be a flash at around 7:00 to the object. I looked into the sky as I was exiting my building and noticed an object in the sky. It looked to be a star but it was at 11:30 in the morning. The sun was shining bright and there were not clouds in the area. I then went and asked another person to come and take a look to seee if they saw it. They did see it and then went and got another person to take a look. He saw it as well. The object was about 45-50 degrees in the eastern sky and did not move. We looked to see if we could see other stars but could not. After watching it for about 15 minutes I noticeed that at about one half inch and at 7:00 to the object there would be a flash about every minute or so. I asked one of the others if he saw a flash around the object with out telling him where and after a few minutes he that he did and in the same position as I did. I wanted to make sure that it was not my eyes playing tricks. The object looked to be very high in the sky like it could be a star. We watched some jets fly through the sky and they did not seem to be even close to it. The jets looked very small to our eyes and ones that looked larger and closer left condensation trails behind them. We all left and went bak to work and would periodically look to se if it was still there. In a two hour period the object seemed to get more dull. We think it was due to the sun moving toward the west. In that time the object moved a total of 2-3 inches the the north, maybe due to the rotation of the earth. I last saw it at around 2:00 when I had to leave the building and go to another location. When I got there I looked to see if I could see it but there were clouds in the sky blocking the view.;42.5574999999999;-71.1736000000001
