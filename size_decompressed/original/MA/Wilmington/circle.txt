A large round object appeared above the tree line.  in our back wooded swamp yard.  We got scared and ran to the front door.  We look at it again and it went straight up in the air faster then a bullet and disappear.   We told our parents and they laugh.  23 years later my sister, mother, boyfriend.  Sat in the yard and they heard a loud noise look in the sky a round object appeared and took straight up in the sky and disappear.  And now I live in Texas.

  Circle;2001-10-03 20:15:00;2 mins;I was out on my lawn viewing the near full moon...I bright object caught my eye, it had a bluish hue. I thought it was a firework and expected to see little pieces break off, and it would disappear. I believe the planet Mars is in the northern sky, and has been recently...(if not, there is a very reddish star there that crosses the sky). This object was about 4 times the size of it. Maybe a 4th- 5th the size of tonights moon. Anyhow, the object faded away quickly, travelling northwestward. It appeared to be very high in the sky when I lost sight of it. It seemed, maybe within 10000 feet when I first saw it. The object made no noise. I am a veteran skywatcher and I have seen satellites travel through the night sky, reflecting the sun.They usually, I believe, have a yellowish hue, and are never close to being this vivid. It did travel in a straight line away from me as a satellite would.( I'm not sure about the distance 10000', it's a guess, I live on approach to Logan Airport..based on aircraft sightings) Thanks;42.5574999999999;-71.1736000000001

Stationary round metallic object in the sky, WIlmington, MA, 1/14/18.;2018-01-14 11:45:00;10 seconds;Stationary round metallic object in the sky, WIlmington, Massachusetts 1/14/18 At approx: 11:45am on 01/14/2018, while driving to purchase a coffee,  I observed a circular object that was stationary in the sky at a relatively high altitude.  The object was shiny metallic in color.  The object did not have any contrail activity behind it.  It did not emit a sound.  It just remained idle in the sky.   After trying to process what it was I was seeing, I pulled my vehicle into a safe location free of traffic, I lost site of the object.  Roughly five minutes later, my girlfriend also observed the object and pointed it out to me.  I saw it for a split second, then, due to the route I was driving, the view of the object was obscured by a tall tree.   Moving my vehicle to get away from the obstructed view, we lost all vision of the object.  We continued to search for the object for another 10 minutes or so, but the object had vanished. Its important to note, that during the observation of the object and immediately after, there was alot of aircraft activity more than usually observed at this particular time of day. Please note, what I observed is not a hoax or a prank.  I am a retired volunteer police officer, retiring at the rank of Lieutenant.  As a self proclaimed sceptic/believer, I too, would be hesitant to find any validity in this report, but what I saw is exactly what I observed.  I am hopeful that other people in the area observed what I observed. Thank you, ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and we found him to be quite sober-minded about his sighting, and convincing.  We suspect that he is an excellent, and highly reliable, witness, a fact underscored by his law-enforcement background.  PD));42.5574999999999;-71.1736000000001
