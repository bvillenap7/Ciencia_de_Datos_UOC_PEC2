They flew west to east changing formation in a circular pattern whenever the front oval moved north or south. They disapeared at about an angle of 3:00 from my view. It took less than 1 minute as I was sitting at the stop light at the shopping center. It started over the car dealership and ended over the trees above the shopping center. They were very bright and shiny yellow-gold.;42.5574999999999;-71.1736000000001
