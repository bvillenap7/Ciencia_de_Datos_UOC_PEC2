Flashing light object jets straight into air and continues climb.;2001-10-14 17:00:00;3 minutes;Flashing light object jets straight into air and continues climb. The other witness and I were outside and we observed a flashing,bright object, emitting a trail(very large) circular in shape going straight up. It looked like a stream of light in a way with a continued climb. We did not think it was a plane or military jet because there are no military air force bases in that area(the object looked at least 10 miles away).

Bat-shaped glider over Franklin, MA.;2014-08-03 16:00:00;10 minutes;Bat-shaped glider over Franklin, MA. Odd black bat- or bird-shaped object a couple of hundred feet up, drifted lazily northwest until it disappeared behind the tree canopy horizon. Object never flapped, so it seemed unlikely to have been a bird.  It appeared to have something rope-like dangling from it, so we think it may have been a kite.   I looked at it through a 9x scope, but couldn't gather any additional details. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

A straight line of around 6 oval lights with a slight wobble moving across the sky.   ((Starlink satellites?));2020-06-04 02:40:00;3 minutes;A straight line of around 6 oval lights with a slight wobble moving across the sky. At around 2:40 Am I went outside and saw a line of lights in a line in the sky. At first I thought it must be a reflection on the clouds but then it moved very slowly in the direction of the next town over. The lights seemed to be oval shaped and had a slight wobble, there were 6 of them very close together. From my perspective, I assumed they were part of the same object. I watched for a few minutes and then it disappeared.;42.08;-71.4174999999998
