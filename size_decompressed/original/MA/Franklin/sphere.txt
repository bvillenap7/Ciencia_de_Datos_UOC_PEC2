Spherical object hovered then moved away at an extremely high rate of speed.;2008-10-23 15:00:00;25 seconds;Spherical object hovered then moved away at an extremely high rate of speed. I was outside waiting to meet a family member. The sky was clear and there was a 3 -5 miles per hour wind blowing. I was sitting on a bench seat under a tree and happened to look up. I noticed an object in close proximity to the Sun which was behind a tree limb, and I thought the object was reflecting the Sun Light. The object floated into view, and did not appear to be move very fast.  At first I thought it was something caught on the wind, but then it stopped and hovered for a several seconds.  The object appeared to be solid at this time, and then it moved quickly to the side, and then I followed it as it rapidly moved up into the sky and accelerated away at an extremely high rate of speed. I was able to follow it for few seconds, before it accelerated up at what I estimated to be a 60 degree angle and out of sight.  If the Sun had not been behind the tree limb, I would never have seen it it would have been lost in the glare. I am sorry, but I do not want to leave contact information.  I am not sure what I saw, but I was convinced by a friend to enter the information at this site. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

Bright green sphere flying extremally & scary fast overhead;2017-02-13 21:05:00;3 seconds;Bright green sphere flying extremely & scary fast overhead. Neon green ball like flying object.  No sound.  No trail.  Over 4 story hotel. 150 yards away. Very very extremally fast. Just closing up my business.  Pitch black out other than moon on other side of tree line.  And hotel lighting.  Not like a light flash or a reflection.  Not a flare. Really odd & hair on arms stood up on end. If wasn't staring at hotel across parking lot as I locked up I would have never seen it.
