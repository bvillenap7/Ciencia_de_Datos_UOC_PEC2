It appeared in the region of Orion as a light brighter than the surronding stars,but with out any twinkle. It moved from one location in the sky to another without appearing to move through the space between. It hovered overhead for about 1 second then shot off faster than I could follow. It had distinct lines, there was as I said, no twinkle and the light did not appear to be relected from any other source. The speed and manner in which it moved was astonishing. I have never seen an unidentified flying object before this, but it was definately under some control. The skies were clear, and there was no sound associated with the object.;42.08;-71.4174999999998
