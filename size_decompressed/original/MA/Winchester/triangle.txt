rotating grey triangle;2010-09-03 16:00:00;2 minutes;rotating grey triangle Deep in the sky, high above the clouds, I noticed a triangular grey object moving very quickly across the sky.  At first, it looked like a kite, but after realizing how fast and straight it was traveling I quickly ruled out that explanation.  I pointed this object out to 3 other observers, who then tried to explain what it was.  Then it rotated at least 90 degrees and maintained its course and speed, exactly.  I would say it was not an equilateral triangle, but an almost equal-sided isosceles.  It was heading North East.  It may have been the fastest flying object I have ever seen.
