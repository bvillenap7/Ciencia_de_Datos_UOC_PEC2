Huge rectangular craft with missing time;1980-10-20 21:00:00;20 minutes;Huge rectangular craft with missing time I was riding my 10 speed home and there is a large steep hill on the way from Woburn to Winchester.  i usually coasted down that hill because by the bottom i could reach speeds up to 40 mph.  I started down the hill and next thing i knew i was back at the top of the hill watching a huge rectangular craft with many lights on it flying away perhaps 2/10 mile away in a  1 O'clock position relative to my position.  I estimate the hill itself was between 1-2 football fields in length with a 60 degree incline.  A short time had passed and i had no memory of the missing time.  The craft was huge and i can only guess its size at perhaps 1000 feet long or more but no sounds or exhaust were seen.  There were 4 rows of lights along its side that glowed white and steady.  Over the next 1-2 years i began getting strangers coming in to my work asking for me and not leaving any contact info.  This happened enough to draw concerns among coworkers.;42.4532;-71.1428
