It was  flying at a slight  angle. It was not very high in the sky, as it moved in the sky from North West to west and was visible for about 15 to 20 seconds and than the lights just completely disappeared. The sky was clear and you could see stars and a few aircraft in the distance but they were much smaller compared to the unknown object and the aircraft had blinking lights and were higher than the unknown flying object.;42.1116695652174;-71.865147826087
