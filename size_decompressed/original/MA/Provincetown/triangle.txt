Illuminated triangle makes strange movements in the sky;2012-08-31 23:20:00;1 minute;Illuminated triangle makes strange movements in the sky My friends and I were returning home from dinner when I noticed there was a strange green illuminated object in the sky, travelling too slow to be a meteor and too erratically and quickly to be a plane.  I called my girlfriends attention and we watched as it traveled indecisively throughout the sky.  It was a triangle, I'd say about 5,000 ft. up there but this is a pure guess, and lacked wings or any distinct characteristics of a plane or helicopter.  It had no flashing lights but illuminated greens and blues for a while before it changed and included reds. It danced around the sky, with no direction, going fast at some points and slow with others.  The strangest of the movement was when it changed direction there seemed to be no lag time for it to swhich- it was one fluid motion that went against the laws of physics.  We watched for about a minute before it disappeared behind buildings. Whether it landed on the ground or into the sky I do not know, but it was o! ver water while we witnessed the event.
