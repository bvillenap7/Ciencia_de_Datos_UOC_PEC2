Bright oval light in western sky at sunset;2006-10-14 18:00:00;three minutes;Bright oval light in western sky at sunset While out walking to observe sunset, I looked west, toward Boston, and saw a bright round object, possibly at 10,000 ft. altitude, which remained stationary and within a minute, slowly disappeared.  I then continued walking another 100 feet to the corner, turned and saw the object again in the same position. It slowly disappeared again. By the way, I had seen another cigar shaped object in daylight in the same location, a few years ago.  I am familiar with the aircraft in holding patterns around Logan Airport.  This light had none of the characteristics typical of those craft.;42.0522;-70.1833
Immense golden light over Provincetown harbor returned  three more times  in 12-15 minutes;2011-09-16 23:15:00;10 minutes;immense golden light over Provincetown harbor returned  three more times  in 12-15 minutes as we were going to bed in our house on the water's edge, just as my wife got into bed, an immense goldenish light appeared over Provincetown bay,  it cast no shadow  and after a few seconds rose off to the right, changing as it diminished  into an oval  shape with a dark or hollow center, moving off into the  night sky.  I had called my wife to look at  it, which she did, so there was a witness.  A minute or two later it reappeared from the left, became the same   immense light, same location, again no shadow  or glare.  I was so astonished that I stood there, and again it went away and returned, twice, a total of four appearances.   The unfortunate  thing is that  that afternoon I had left my NIkon camera downstairs to ake with us to see our granddaughter, and neither had  nor remembered it. I called the local airport and police, and the next day the Mass National Guard at Otis AFB, with no results  or interest.;42.0522;-70.1833
