PD)) a bright, twinkling star that had red and blue appearances to it....through the binoculars other colors were visible I was out on a deck smoking a cigarette and just looking around.  I looked over towards the Pilgrim Monument and then my eyes wandered upward to the sky.  It was a clear night and there were many visible stars.  As I looked due east I saw a particularly bright, blinking star that appeared to also have red and blue colors.  I stared at it for several minutes and the brightness of it would grow and dim and sometimes fade completely only to return again.  I was very curious about what i was seeing.  i called my friend out of the house to take a look.  I pointed to the sky and asked him to tell me what he saw.  He said he saw a bright star and thought he saw some red in it.  I asked if he had binoculars which he went and got.  He gave them to me and through them could see and object grayish in color with lights at the bottom of it which seemed to move round and flash.  The closest thing I can compare the shape of it to is a hat...wider at the bottom and rounded at the top.  The object was not moving in any direction.  Without the binoculars it appeared stationary, but with them it was pulsating or moving irratically in one spot.  Without describing what I was seeing I asked my friend to tell me what he saw and his description mirrored my own.  This was the first time for either one of us to see something this curious in the sky.   I find that the thought of what it could be keeps entering my mind so I sought out a place to report it for what it is worth...;42.0522;-70.1833
