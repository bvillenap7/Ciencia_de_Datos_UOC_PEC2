Three white lights at high altitude in a triangle formation moving at jet liner speed;1995-06-01 23:00:00;45 sec;Three white lights at high altitude in a triangle formation moving at jet liner speed This is a posting that relates to a sighting that occured in West Dennis, Massachusetts, on 8/31/97, and which is listed in this database.  My sighting involved a night out near the beach in Provincetown, MA, looking for satellites. I observed a triangle formation of three white lights moving at a jet liner speed, as if at 35,000 feet altitude, and at 50 degrees elevation or so.  The lights moved across a short arc and disappeared in sequence.  I was impressed by their lock-step movement, and I thought at the time that even military craft would not fly at that distance apart.  This sighting may seem innocuous, except that the West Dennis case involves what I am sure is the same sort of thing.  On another occasion, by the way, I was looking for satellites in Maine while on vacation and I saw a white light moving like a satellite, when it suddenly made a 90-degree turn!  This happened in Aug. of 1992 near Bath, ME.;42.0522;-70.1833
