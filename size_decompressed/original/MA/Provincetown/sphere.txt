I was walking the dogs on a little hill and one round glowing object coming in a straight line very fast with a weird light coming out of the top of it and it slowed down when going over my head and was moving in a weird way and slowed and just stopped. If it was a ballon or chinese latern it would not have stopped or changed direction. And the light that came out of the top of it looked like electricity and a weird color that I have never seen before but the whole thing glowed very bright white light the shape of an orb. Then I tried to take a pic with my iphone and i didn't get it in time. It moved so slow over my head that I would have gotten a good picture for sure but I was so flustered Then another one came and was a different shape with a orange light came from the same direction but was smaller and i got my iphone out again and it got stuck in one posistion and it never did that before. the shutter would not open. I really don't believe in ufo's and this one shook me up a bit and the dogs where acting weird as well. I am the type of guy that likes to debunk things like that but this was something I have never seen before, especially the light that was illuminating out of the top of it, it was almost unnatural and the way it moved was also not manmade. I can't explain how I know that but the way it moved and the color was not manmade.;42.0522;-70.1833
