4 rocket fires seen in succession traveling northeast over Cape Cod Massachusetts.;2013-09-01 21:15:00;0.5 hour;4 rocket fires seen in succession traveling northeast over Cape Cod Massachusetts On September 1, 2013 at approximately 9:15 pm EDT 4 persons witnessed what appeared to be 4 rockets or missiles traveling in a northeast direction.  The first rocket fire was seen at 9:15 pm. EDT.  The next rocket fire appeared 10 minutes later in the sky at the same position as the first one appeared.  There were a total of 4 rockets seen.  Each rocket followed the same trajectory and at one point, two rockets could be seen, one overhead and one in the distance.  There may have been more than four rockets.  The witnesses only saw four.  The sightings were made from Provincetown, Massachusetts on Cape Cod.  All four witnesses were sober.  The rockets themselves could not be seen.   What was visible to naked eye was a fire ball similar to ones seen from rockets launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, in the 1970s and 1980s.  The witnesses considered the possibility of the phenomena being airplanes.  They dismissed this possibility, as the fire was very bright and burned steady as the rockets ascended.  There were no standard flashing lights as seen on most private and commercial aircraft.  We have scanned the news sights for other sightings.  None have been found at this point.  The witnesses talked with other areas residents, most had seen nothing, Two said they spotted at least on rocket crossing the sky.  We are curious about this.  The witnesses did not think these were extraterrestrial craft, and thought most likely a military exercise.  If you witnessed this, we are curious to know your observations.;42.0522;-70.1833
