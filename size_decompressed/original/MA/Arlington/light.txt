Two balls of light holding planes midair;2008-06-19 22:00:00;5 minutes;Two balls of light holding planes midair Two lights. Have video tape. 2 Witnesses. Hovered for 5 minutes in one spot then one light moved above the other and flew off.  When it flew overhead it seemed like a plane but there is no way a plane could have done what it did.  Second light same thing.  Hovered 5 minutes more than flew over me.  Looks like a plane I think flying over but canâ€™t explain what happened. Almost like two planes were held by two balls of light then let go.;42.4167932432432;-71.1650202702702
String of oval shaped lights circle each other to form a larger craft.;2017-05-26 22:30:00;90 minutes;String of oval shaped lights circle each other to form a larger craft. I looked out my bedroom window at around 10:30 PM Friday, May 26th, 2017, to see a large series of lights rotating counter clockwise.  It appeared as though the lights were forming a very large circular craft.  There appeared to be a secondary craft about half the size of the first rotating in the opposite direction than the original series of lights and hovering adjacent.  I ruled out search lights as the sky was very cloudy, and no streaks of lights indicating a ground level light were seen, just large pull shaped lights slowly circling.  There was no sound to be heard.   The phenomenon lasted an hour and a half after I had originally seen it through my window, there is no telling whether or not it had started earlier.   At 12:00 midnight I returned to the window to check on the position of the lights and they had completely disappeared without a trace.   Another thing worth nothing: during the time that the lights were visible, three conventional aircrafts were heard.  I heard one helicopter, and two planes.  I live close to Logan Airport, commercial flights are very common to see and hear, but the two planes sounded distinctly louder and were only breifly heard.  The lights remained well after the conventional aircrafts had left earshot.;42.4167932432432;-71.1650202702702
