3 stars circle, join and fly away;1995-07-20 22:00:00;5 minutes;3 stars circle, join and fly away Looked like 3 white stars at first brighter than usual. Then they started to move fairly slowly.  They formed a circle and moved slowly in a circular motion.  All of a sudden they sped up real fast in the same circular motion and then they spun closer together and then sped off away. Just left work and completly sober at the time.  I called the police station after but no one else called them to report it.  I'll never forget.  I've seen the same type of things on Sci-Fi stations so I know it is something. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
