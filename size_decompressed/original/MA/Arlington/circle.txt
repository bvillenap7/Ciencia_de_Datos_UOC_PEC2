2 unidentified objects over Arlington, Ma skies for over 2 hours with military observation.;2001-09-11 22:00:00;over 2 hours;2 unidentified objects over Arlington, Ma skies for over 2 hours with military observation. My daughter was looking through the binoculars into the sky and called me in to look.  I went out to the front porch and there was an object stationary- was hard to make out the exact shape but looked circular with green edges, white in middle with pulsating yellowish-orange lights in middle.  It remained stationary for over 2 hours.  I looked around and saw a smaller one under it of greenish color.  It could have been farther away.  I called the police dept. and they told me people had been calling it in.  I told him I saw 2 jets fly above and beneath it.  He said they were X-16's out of a nearby military base.  They also sent out several small planes to investigate it.  At 12:30 am the sirens went off in Arlington Center 3 times.  Around 1:00 am I noticed there were no more colors coming off of them, then they were gone.  I heard the planes a few times while I lay in bed trying to sleep. ((NUFORC Note:  We believe that the description of the object is not inconsistent with that of a celestial body, probably a twinkling star.  PD));42.4167932432432;-71.1650202702702
Fast moving light;2004-07-04 22:15:00;30 seconds;Fast moving light Single light moving very fast observed in the night sky while waiting for fireworks. I only noticed it because I was watching another light (I believe was an airplane) and this other light overtook it. It was moving at a greater speed than the 'airplane' and moved in a elliptical pattern that seemed to be unattainable by what I know (which is little) of what an airplane or helicopter can do.
