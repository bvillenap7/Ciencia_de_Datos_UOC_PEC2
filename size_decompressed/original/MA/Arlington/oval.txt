My husband and I were coming from waltham threw Belmont heading toward mass ave arlington.....aproaching a red traffic light my husband said ,LOOK UP. LOOK UP  I knew what I was seeing but realized after I had said Oh my God what is it, he said a ufo..... I was in  awe .....totally fasinated it was beautiful... It radiated the most beautiful shade of  blue lighting  Id ever seen. it  appeared to be round looking up from under it and  had a lighted dome ,lighting in the dome area was the color of a brightly lit room ..... there was nothing in the dome area it was close eanough to have definately seen any thing if it was in that area.....   it  had what appeared to be recessed lights around it ....described by other as port holes ,maybe because I dont believe the lighting was coming from them  .....it appeared to be  hovering above a yellow sloped roof house with the kind of tall  T type antena that were used  on the homes in the late 50's  for better TV reception.....  it appeared to be so close to the top of that yellow house that if there was any noise coming from it. it had to be heared from that house   . when my husband said look up..... At that moment we were approaching  the set of lights ,over route 2.the road on the right would have lead to down onto route 2 below .....  I believe it  was  raining that night in that area but when we got home the streets were dry, I had asked my husband  to please go down the side streets so i could get a view of it again,but he could not take a right  and the houses were blocking the view ,as this has hovering much to low. My husband would never disscuss it again so I knew I had to try to forget it, though a few years later 2 or possibly 3 or even more the subj! ect came up about a ufo book and I found, I  mentioned it at the table to all there with all the details I believe are here. we never mentioned it again.
