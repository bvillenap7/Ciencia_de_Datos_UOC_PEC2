As it is descending completely changed direction of descent and zipped across space I was sitting with my window open writing a Research paper, when bright blinking lights caught the corner of my eye.

It continued descending with this same order of blinking for a little less than a minute, then all of a sudden the lights converged in into one red white moving ball, and quickly flew/ hovered a completely different direction leaving a brief red white mark in the night sky that did not last more than 2 seconds.
