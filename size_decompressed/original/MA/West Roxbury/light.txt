((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of planets??  PD))  Unusual pre-dawn sighting.;2004-02-11 05:45:00;3-5 Minutes;Unusual predawn sighting. About 5:45 a.m. Wednesday February 11,2004, I was out with my dog before leaving for work. I happened to look up at the moon and noticed, what at first, looked like two planets (one over the other). I recall thinking how unusual this would be without any pomp and circumstance in the news. They appeared to be planet-like instead of stars because their light was steady - not winking. I just couldn't believe the closeness of these two celestial bodies.  They were below the half-moon by about a hand width at anns length and very bright - similar to Venus and Jupiter. It was too high above the horizon to be Venus (approximate location of the sun at high noon), but there wasn't any other explanation in my opinion. The objects weren't moving - they were stationary. While standing there frozen in my gaze, the top one began fading in strength much like a variable star but happening so fast it couldn't have been.  I thought perhaps it might be a cloud or mist rolling across my view of this planet like object, but when I checked the sky, there wasn't a cloud or mist of any kind whatsoever. The stars and the moon were crystal clear and there was a faint star just below the moon that remained the same brightness throughout my observation.  Within less than 20 seconds the light from the first object had disappeared completely. I was flabbergasted.  And then shortly afterward the second source began fading until within a short period of time, it too was gone.  It couldn't have been two stationary satellites reflecting the rising sun, because the sun would be shining on them (rising within the hour) - not setting on them.

4 lights meeting at a point, rotating 45 degrees, then meeting again.;2014-12-05 18:29:00;10 minutes;4 lights meeting at a point, rotating 45 degrees, then meeting again. 	The objects were lights, circular, moving in a set pattern in the sky.  They would meet at a point, spread out, rotate 45 degrees, then meet again at the same point.  There were 4 lights.  They were a sort of translucent white, like searchlights. 	I saw them on my way home from the train.  Several other people in the neighborhood - commuters & people walking their dogs - also saw and commented on the lights.   I do not believe in intelligent aliens seeking to observe, explore, or contact Earth and do not believe in UFO sightings, but the paranormal has always interested me and I have found no logical explanation for the lights.;42.2783;-71.1592999999999
