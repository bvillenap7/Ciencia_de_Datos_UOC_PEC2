Bright white light no blinking lights no sound.;2014-08-19 21:00:00;4 minutes;Bright white light no blinking lights no sound Sitting on back porch at 9:00 pm and saw a bright light moving slowly going south east flying low about normal plane hieght about 1minute after take off.  There was only one light very white and bright, no blinking lights.  We noticed as it was getting closer this object was not making any noise at all even when it was directly over us.   As we watched this object go by, I would say about one minute after it flew over the bright light started to dim and then eventually disappear into the night.;42.2783;-71.1592999999999
