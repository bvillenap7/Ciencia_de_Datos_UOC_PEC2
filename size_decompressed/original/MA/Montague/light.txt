My friend and i were out on my deck when he saw a glowing orb about 150 yards out above a field south of my house. he then asked me what it was and when i said i didnt know we stood in awe for a few minutes then it slowly floated away to the east. he lives up our road and started to move up it when at the railroad crossing he saw it again.it was about the same 150 yards down the tracks and about 100' off the ground. he called me over and we both stared at it. then we started to run towards it why?, i dont know but we did. it was the brightest thing we've ever seen but it wasn't blinding. the light was reflecting off the rails onto us.it then started to drift around the corner following the tracks. we stopped and watched for a few seconds and then continued to walk to where it was. the air smelt cooked and it was very warm. after that we stayed out all night but it didnt come back.;42.5394;-72.5319
