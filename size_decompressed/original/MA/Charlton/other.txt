Bright Pulsating Moving Light/Object.   ((NUFORC Note:  Sirius??  PD));2011-09-25 22:30:00;1 hour;Bright Pulsating Moving Light/Object Last night as I sat out on my veranda with my cousin when we noticed an odd bright light.  Not like a star this one had a large hazy halo around it.  The object pulsated to the right and then to the left, then forward and back.  The object also went up and down.   When we looked through a telescope to get a better eye's view the light was so bright it was hard to focus on it through a telescope so we used binocular's instead.  The object also faded in and out and we watched it for approx. an hour before we went in and called it a night.  It was not a star nor an airplane.   While we were watching it an airplane flew passed it and the object did not disappear.   Tonight we are going to look for it again and see if we can get pictures of it this time.;42.1379;-71.9664
