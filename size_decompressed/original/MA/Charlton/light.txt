We noticed a very bright spot in the sky. The main color was white.  ((NUFORC Note:  Star or planet, we suspect.  PD));2009-08-16 01:00:00;4-5 hours or so;From the shore of my pond we noticed a very bright spot in the sky. The main color was white but there were little lights with red and green. The spot was moving slightly around as if to be hovering. We decided to take a canoe to see if we could get a better look from the pond. When we got to the other side of the pond we noticed another light in the exact opposite side of the sky. Once both objects were in view they appeared to be the exact same type of thing. The objects were so bright we could see them until the sun came into view. We have seen these same types of objects many times in this area with many different witnesses.
