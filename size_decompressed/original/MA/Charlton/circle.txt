Bright red/orange perfectly round object slowly moving object moved east to west.  No trail.;2018-03-26 19:00:00;10 seconds;Bright red/orange perfectly round object slowly moving object moved east to west.  No trail. Looking north toward the lights of Worcester, MA, no stars were visable only the moon.  A perfectly round, very bright, reddish orange object appeared from the east moving west.  It was slow and very steady.  There was no trail.  It was very bright when it appeared, crossing the sky keeping the same altitude and just suddenly disappeared.  Never getting smaller or dimmer.;42.1379;-71.9664
