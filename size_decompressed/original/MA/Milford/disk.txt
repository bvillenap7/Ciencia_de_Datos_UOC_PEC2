saucer shaped craft closely and clearly viewed for 15 seconds before disappearing in a streak at an incredible rate of speed;1975-06-01 18:00:00;15 seconds;saucer shaped craft closely and clearly viewed for 15 seconds before disappearing in a streak at an incredible rate of speed I was walking on Central Street to a meeting with friends and I looked to the south down Beach Street Extension.  There in the sky hovering over the houses on the east side of the street was a saucer shaped object with revolving lights around the perimeter.  The saucer was clearly visable in the sky and was rocking back and forth left to right approximately a saucer width or 1.5 saucer widths to each side.  After staring at the object for approximately 15 seconds the saucer disappeared in a streak of light heading towards the east.  I told friends and family about the incident but do not recall hearing any other reports at that time.  At this moment I became a believer in UFOs, no question, no doubt.
