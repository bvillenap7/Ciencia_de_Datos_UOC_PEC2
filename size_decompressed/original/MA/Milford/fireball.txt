Fireball holding position with slight movement.;2015-09-05 20:00:00;5 minutes;Fireball holding position with slight movement. Dusk, short horizon line perhaps 1, 2 miles away a large yellow fireball maintaining its position with slight side movement, descended very slowly maybe 5 degrees to a position just out of site below neighboring roof lines.   From viewing distance to fireball the size comparison would be double that of a large jumbo jet.  All i can think of is chariots of fire.;42.1476;-71.5319
