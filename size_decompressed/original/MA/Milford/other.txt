I happened to look up and watched two lines coming straight down from the sky for about 3 minutes.  It went very slow, and then disintegrated or totally disappeared.   I did not see a shape of a craft.  I just seen two huge lines side-by-side.  It looked like it was many feet apart, but it looked like a plane coming straight down.   It was one of the strangest sights I have ever seen in my life.;42.1476;-71.5319
