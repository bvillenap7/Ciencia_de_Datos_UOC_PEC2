Triangle type craf with lights over Milford;2010-06-25 23:23:00;40 seconds;Triangle type craf with lights over Milford We were on our way back from dinner.  As we drove down our street there was a craft banking towards us as it moved left.  It was triangular shaped with blue lights on the back that almost looked like afterburners. It had red light on the side.  At first i thought it was just a low flying plane from the neerby airport but I have a pilots license and i know planes.  I can tell you that that was NOT a plane.  When we arrived home i turned on the police scanner and there were 7 calls of house alarms going off all at once.  I believe that the craft caused it.;42.1476;-71.5319

Black kite figure, flying over tree tops. Red, blue, and green lights on bottom. moving slow like plane, in a straight path. very quiet. I was driving  uphill, when it came over the tree tops, 30 to 40 feet offground. I turned off my radio to hear what it sounded  like . but it was silent like a glider. It was black, like the nights sky. The sun set almost a hour earlier. Thought it was police plane, untill it matched other descriptions given by previous observers.
