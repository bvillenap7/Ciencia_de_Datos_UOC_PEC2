Formation of solid lights over cape cod.   ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-06 20:19:00;9 minutes;Formation of solid lights over cape cod I went outside to vape and I was looking up at night sky because I knew Venus was going to be prominent tonight and I saw a slow flying formation going from west to east.  I watched for about 9 to 10 minutes crossing the sky.  I did not change path or change direction.  Nor did it change the distance between each of the objects.  I live near an Air Force base and I am familiar with what is in my sky.  This was out of the ordinary.  I watched it move across the whole horizon and it did not change direction in any way shape or form.;41.5953;-70.5705
