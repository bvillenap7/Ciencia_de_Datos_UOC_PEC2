This time, my cousin and I were outside to see if the light was there that night. It was very cloudy that night. We looked to the same area where my father, mother and I had saw it a couple nights earlier. We saw it again, underneath the clouds. It stood there for about 30 seconds and disappeared. We went inside to turn off the outside light. When we came back out it was still gone. Around 10 seconds later, it reappeared. It stood in the same area for about a minute. It then zig-zagged very fast and disappeared. We have not seen it again.;41.5953;-70.5705

It looked about plane height, but I have never seen a plane with a bright orange light, or a plane go in that path.  I was the color on Mars, with the luminosity of a very bright star. I did not keep looking at it once it had begun to leave the view of my window. I look back out around 11:05, and an orange dot had come into view over my neighbors house, and by 11:07 the dot was gone.;41.5953;-70.5705
