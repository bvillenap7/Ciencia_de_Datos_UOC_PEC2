My mom and I were out walking. In the western sky we saw a flashing green and red light. Besides the color and the flashing it looked much like a star. We continued to walk and above of us we could see a fast cigar shaped craft flying through the sky. It had a dull orange color to it. In continued to go through the sky until we lost it behind the trees. We went inside of the house. We told my father of the experience and me and him went out with a pair of binoculars. The green red flashing star was still in the sky, but it had moved into the north-eastern sky. We used the binoculars to get a clearer view of the colors and we what we saw was a star looking light that was green. At the bottom of it was a flashing red light. My father and I dismissed it as a plane and went back inside. I came out ten minutes later to see if it was still there. It was still there, floating in the sky. My father and I continued to watch it. Over the course of 20 minutes or so it very very slowly drifted east. We continued to watch ht for another ten minutes and went back inside. I cam back out nearly half an hour later. It was still there but it had drifted into the eastern sky. It was flashing much more distinctly now. It made a flash and then vanished. My father went out later and found it back were we originally saw it with the binoculars.
