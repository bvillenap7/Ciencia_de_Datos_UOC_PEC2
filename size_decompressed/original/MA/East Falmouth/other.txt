Bright Underwater Lights in ocean;2007-11-23 22:30:00;15-20 minutes;Bright Underwater Lights in ocean The object was underwater, about 100 feet from shore. At first I thought it was some kind of wierd fog that was rolling in, but I began to get nevrvous as it approached the shoreline. I got out of my car to have a closer look and walked down the the edge of the water.  It was hard to see the object because it appeared translucent, and emmitted light patterns of white, yellow and blue green light. The object came within 20 feet of the shoreline, stopped and remained still for 5 minutes or so before it took off at amazing speed.  It was GONE, at the blink of my eye.  Very strange. Never saw anything like this before. Have observed underwater craft in the waters before being so close to Woods Hole, but this was something I can't describe. Still gives me chills.
