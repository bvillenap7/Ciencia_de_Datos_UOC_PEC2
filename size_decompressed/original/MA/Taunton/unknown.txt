Unknown in Taunton.;2013-05-03 19:20:00;3-4 minutes;Unknown in Taunton I was driving and noticed these objects in the sky.  They were all close together so I knew it couldn't be jets or anything.  They seemed to be at a stand still at that time also.  There were about 8 objects all in the same area.  Then they were gone.  I had seen a flying object with my daughter in the same area about a month back also.;41.9082;-71.1031
