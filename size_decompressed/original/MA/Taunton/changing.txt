Bright moving lights over Taunton, Massachusetts, night sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Twinkling stars??  PD));2016-04-08 21:00:00;~1 hour;Bright moving lights over Taunton, Massachusetts, night sky. Starting at approximately 21:00 hours, Friday evening, April 9, my 16 year old son yelled to meâ€¦,Mom, come look!   We spent the next hour watching multiple strange orange orbs and flashing moving objects.  Red, green and faint blue lights pulsed from the objects.   They would stay still for moments and them move back and forththrought the sky.  They were completley silent and appeared triangle in shape.   The way they moved was like nothing ive ever seen.  Almost appeared to change shape or size (or visible dimension).  Very strange.   We also witnessed what we thought were helicopters at one point, trying to get close to the orbs.
