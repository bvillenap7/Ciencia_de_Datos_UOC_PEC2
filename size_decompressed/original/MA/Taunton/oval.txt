Oval disk with three yellow lights on bottom, red and green light on either side producing a low drone, flew a few hundred feet above.;2014-02-26 04:30:00;3 minutes;Oval disk with three yellow lights on bottom, red and green light on either side producing a low drone, flew a few hundred feet above. I've been seeing glowing yellow lights moving in peculiar paths in the sky at night for 6 or more months.  Often there are two or three different objects.   On multiple occasions I've sat with others and had them witness the bright yellow lights themselves, but never had it come this close to me. Today's:  Glowing yellow light coming from the South West Didn't seem to be heading toward me at first, but began to do so. From afar appeared yellow, with small green light glowing behind it. Seemed to move upward first, before approaching. As it approached it sounded like a quiet plane, and it became more apparent. Flew directly overhead, very slowly.  Looked to be only a few hundred feet up. Couldn't quite make out a shape, but it appeared to be oval.  From directly below it, it had three bright yellow lights in a triangular form, but clearly separate lights.  There were also green and red lights on either side, one or two on each side. As it was closer by, it sounded as though it emitted more of a whooping sound, with sort of a droning low tone, as though it was hovering. Considered it to be a plane, but there aren't any prominent airports south west of here (that I know of)  Even had their been, there would be no reason for a plane to be low-down in this area. Sort of hovered across the sky. As I said, it's path brought it almost directly over my house, and it was low down enough to note that it was slightly off to the side, rather than directly above me.;41.9082;-71.1031
