I was returning home from work and pulled up to a traffic light which was on red. The light is on Bay street right by the Taunton indus;2000-09-27 00:15:00;10 Sec;I was returning home from work and pulled up to a traffic light which was on red. The light is on Bay street right by the Taunton industrial park. I was heading south bound and the sreet has lights going down the right side of street then alittle futher on they switch to left side of street. Some of the lights are brite white and others are yellowish in color. I noticed a light in the center of the road which looked like one of the yellowish lights. As I focused on it I could tell that it was much higher than the others. It was just there not moving at all then it just took off in the southerly direction and disappeared over the horizon. What ever it was it moved faster than anything I have ever seen. This all took place in probably less than 10 seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

It was over 300 yds long and approx 80 yds high and made no no sound at all.;2005-08-15 19:00:00;5 mins.;It was over 300 yds long and approx 80 yds high and made no no sound at all. This object was huge.  Much larger than a blimp. The shape was like taking two pie plates and putting them together. It had oblong lights 6. The craft was some 300yds long and 80 yds high or so. This craft made no noise and hovered just over the tree tops. I have never seen anything that large fly let alone be only 100 yds away and not hear a thing.  The Swiss Airline reported to Logan the next day I heard on the news about a near run in on it's way to or from Logan Airport.  My vision on the craft's shape differs from the one discribed on tv as a rocket shaped one.  I went to get my neighbor and returned but it had disappeard. This was near the quarry in Taunton, MA..
