Large orange/yellow sphere w/pulsating energy  imploded , disappeared then seemed to exploded returning to preious shape but larger.;1976-11-15 22:00:00;approx. 15 mins;Large orange/yellow sphere w/pulsating energy  imploded , disappeared then seemed to exploded returning to preious shape but larger. Fireball sighted on Paul A. Dever State School grounds (now Myles Standish Industrial Park) in Taunton, Mass.  Dates approx. Oct/Nov 1976.  Myself and 2 others driving through heavly wooded back roads of state school came across large orange/yellow sphere, which was stationary in the sky appears almost liquid with pulsating energy or sparks,or aura(almost like line patterns in it,constantly moving).  It's distance I would say was approx. 300 ft away-it was huge like a sun! We were just teenagers at the time and were goofing around flashing the car lights, opening the cars windows, waving at it and saying over here, over here!Unsure of the time duration but the sphere imploded, disappeared, then exploded returning to previous shape but seemed larger. We obviously got very frightened, screaming (the only male there cried uncontrollably) we drove away with it following us,it then seemed to disappear over trees. This is something that has bothered me for 23 years. Also around 94/95 my ex-husband & others spotted a similar object on roadside(Tremont St.Taunton)3-4 cars observed the object.

Red/orange yellow orbs flying at tree line from south to north.;2012-07-21 21:25:00;<1 minute;Red/orange yellow orbs flying at tree line from south to north. I was looking out my kitchen window into the night sky and noticed a cluster of 3 and another cluster of 2 very close by for a total of five bright red/ orange and yellow orbs.  They were low in the sky just above the tree line.  I thought they were planets at first and grabbed my binoculars. Looking through the binoculars, the orbs looked like planets do large silvery colored orbs.  As the first five moved almost out of view a sixth and seventh orb appeared a little lower in the sky.   All seven orbs were moving very fast.  The whole incident was less than a minute.  Then I realized they could not be planets. I was facing south looking out the window and the orbs were moving from right to left, south to North.  The orbs were about one-half the size of the moon and looked very close to the tree tops.;41.9082;-71.1031
