Shooting star stops moving.;2001-10-09 22:00:00;3min;Shooting star stops moving. This is not the first sighting I've seen in a month's time, but I saw it with my wife standing next to me, and it was the most interesting... We are located north of Boston, MA and have a balcony facing east. We were looking out at the unusually uncluttered sky due to the lack of planes.. there were a few, which I'll refer to later. My wife had never seen a shooting star, and I always keep a look-out for one, so she can witness it, and I thought I finally did!  But I was wrong.  I quickly turned her attention to a rapidly descending white object apparently coming down out of the sky.  Since falling stars tend to disappear rapidly, I was very surprised that as the object fell, it did not disappear.  In fact, it slowed down! then appeared to stall, not moving at all.  I could not tell you how large it was, or how close it was, but I DID think it was a shooting star (at first), if that gives you some idea of apparent size and brightness. While the object appeared to not move, i referenced other planes' movements to compare. Well, there was no similarity. And it made no sound. So, now this was strange, but here is another strange phenomenon... One moment, it appeared to be in front of us, glowing bright white, and within a couple of seconds, it WAS ON THE HORIZON, now red in color.  This movement was like something out of MC Escher, where perception changes in an instant. We just agreed we saw a UFO and left it as that!;42.4609;-71.0074
