Then, the object began to slowly approach where I was.  As it did,  the shape changed.  Now it was a flat pie plate kind of shape.  It hung in the area, hovering over at maybe a 45 degree angle.  It was dark on top and light on the bottom  Then, it started to move away again, changing back into the roundish shape.  Circled around one more time, then it appeared to descend.  And it was gone. I know it was a Friday, starting about 8pm, in summer. Donny and Marie was on TV, so that's how I estimated.  Lol;42.4609;-71.0074
