Bright white flashing roundish object, center of the object appeared to be emitting a red, then green, then bluish light at the center.;2020-04-19 22:05:00;30 minutes;Bright white flashing roundish object, center of the object appeared to be emitting a red, then green, then bluish light at the center. At approximately 22:05 I observed a roundish flashing object out of the corner of my eye to the West, while taking my dogs out. It was a bright white flashing type object, flashed, also had a red, then green, then blue looking light that flashed quickly was at the center of the object and had a haze around it (my video in the beginning caught all of these different details). My photos caught the flashing object as looking like a cross like object. It was a distance away, but appeared strange, I went upstairs and took video and photos, as I didn't have my phone on my when I was outside. It also appeared to have a green light in the center of the object. I knew it wasn't a standard aircraft as it was hovering in the same spot for over 10 minutes and seemed to make a few sudden movements. From where I was it seemed to be quite a bit higher in the atmosphere than the plane I saw go by below it. The plane went by like this other object was standing still, however! the object made sudden movements after being still for awhile and then went away further away after about 25 minutes, until I couldn't see it anymore.;42.4609;-71.0074
