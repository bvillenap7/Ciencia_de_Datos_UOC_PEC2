The object was traveling south to north.  The object had no running lights and I lost view of it quickly in adjusting my view space in binoculars as a car was approaching and I was at the curbside.  I realize it was near the space station just appeared that it went by in the background but probably higher in altitude.  It was moving quite fast.  ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be quite sober-minded.  We suspect that he is a quite reliable, and qualified, witness.  PD));42.4609;-71.0074
