Circular object with rotating lights.;2001-04-27 21:00:00;20 mins;Circular object with rotating lights. Just something wierd. I was outside setting up my 90MM refractor.  I'm used to seeing aircraft fly east to west because of Logan airport 30 miles east of here. I just wanted to check out the planets with my telescope. An object about 1/2 degree wide rose over the hill in the east and crossed over the whole sky before disappearing over the west horizon.  No sound.  Seemed wierd because there were 3 lights constantly illuminted and rotating around the whole body. It was in the same path that the planes fly, but I've never seen anything like it.  There was no way to judge distance.  I've spent years outside w/my scope, but nothing like it.;42.7129;-70.9743
