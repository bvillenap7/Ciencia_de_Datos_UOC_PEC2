Tetrahedron inter-dimensional craft or construct composed of smaller particles to create it as a hole.;2007-02-24 13:00:00;1 hour;Tetrahedron inter-dimensional craft or construct composed of smaller particles to create it as a hole. In front of me was a tetrahedron ship, and I noticed it was on three supports at each point of it like landing gear but it was more like a force upon the ground holding up.   It seemed like an invisible force but barely visible due to movement within it much like heat coming off a car on a hot day, but this was focused in the three points.  This ship was it was 12x12x12.  It was and seemed to be more inter dimensional in nature but did leave marks on the ground.   I did take pictures and have an artistic rendering of the ship.
