I came out of the woods in my farthers backyard witch is on a hill. From the hill i looked out over the city of lowell there I saw a big black object flying over the city and heading strait for our postision on the hill.  It flew over us quit low and i had a real good look at it. It was very large triangular with three big lights on the bottom of the craft at the tips of the triangle.  it made no niose and was not a conventinal aircraft. Its thickness would prevent flight as we know it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD));42.6764;-71.3171000000001
