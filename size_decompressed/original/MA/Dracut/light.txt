20 lights move across the sky in Dracut, MA.;2014-11-15 20:23:00;3 minutes;20 lights move across the sky in Dracut, MA. My daughter and I observed 20 lights moving across the night sky over a lake in Dracut, MA. They were traveling south to north toward Orion's belt.   They moved in a cluster formation in a long length across the sky.  Out of the 20, there were three far behind them traveling in the same pattern.  Two were together with the third coming up from behind.  They were bright white lights with no colors, no blinking, and no sound.  My daughter observed them group together in a cluster and move east at that point in the sky.;42.6764;-71.3171000000001
