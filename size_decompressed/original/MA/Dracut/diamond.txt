Extremely strange ships in Massachusetts skies.;2014-02-23 01:00:00;All night;Extremely strange ships in Massachusetts skies. I have been noticing a strange light in the sky that lasts all night.  Sometimes I don't see it for almost a month after it disappears but tonight I saw it and this time a second one was with it.  The both are exactly the same, they seem to have two orangey reddish lights in the center and what looks like an X directly behind them and a horizontal diamond shape behind that.  I thought they were planes but the don't move for hours.  I've tried several times to take pictures but it always comes out to dark and you can't see them.  I've used several different applications on my phone to try and identify them as possibly being a star, planet, satellite, or anything that makes sense but when I point my phone at then it just shows up as empty space.;42.6764;-71.3171000000001
