Moments later we heard rustling through the leaves, twigs breaking My friend and I had just graduated high school and were parked at a boat ramp which is pretty secluded. There were dense woods all around us. It was very dark that night. We were standing outside of my pick up truck talking. My friend was leaning against the truck and I was facing her. From out of nowhere I saw this fireball appear over the tree tops and fall into the nearby woods. I screamed Holy ****! My friend turned around and caught a glimpse of it as well. It was really close. At first I thought it was a meteorite although it was the size of a medicine ball at least. Maybe slightly larger. Moments later we both heard a rustling sound in the leaves and the breaking of twigs and branches. Something was moving through the woods towards us quickly. I immediatly felt very strong sense of danger and fear. It scared the hell out of us. We jumped in the truck and locked the doors and took off as fast I could.  I never spoke of this to anyone until recently when I realized that there was no way it could have been a meteorite. We never heard a crash or bang of the impact even though it went down so close to us. Needless to say, I never went back there again. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
