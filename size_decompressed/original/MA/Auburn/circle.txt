Disappeared after 1-2 While asleep, I was suddenly startled awake by a very bright, blue light that filled my bedroom.  I sat up in bed to take note of the time posted above.  It was then that I realized that my entire bedroom was lit with an extremely blue-tinted light.   I then went to the window that seemed to be the site of the light's entry, on the north side of my home.  It was then that I saw some sort of circular, silver colored object with a band of blue lights traveling east to west down a hill which until recently had been wooded.  There appeared to be a very bright light scanning the surrounding homes and trees. When suddenly, it was gone.   I asked my husband if he was awake.  He indeed was, and yet saw nothing.  Our pet cat ran to me, terrified.  Trembling and yet slapping me.  He will ONLY do this during severe lightening storms.;42.2044999999999;-71.8338000000001
