Three objects moving SSW to NNE across Massachusetts night sky.;2008-06-20 22:00:00;1-2 min;Three objects moving SSW to NNE across Massachusetts night sky. June 20, 2008. At approximately 22:00 hrs, we witnessed a circular object with haze around it traveling SSW to NNE across the night sky. It was moving at a very high rate of speed. The duration was about 30 seconds. Then about 2 minutes later another circular object with haze around it came across the sky in the same direction but with a smaller circular, bright (star like), object in formation with it around it’s 8 o’clock position. That also lasted about 30 seconds. There was myself and 5 other people that witnessed this event. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

A third one joined in after a few seconds. I was laying on the hammock outside looking up when I noticed two faint orbs appear that were initially side by side then a third one joined in from behind them.  They were much higher up than a plane would be and were moving side to side ever so slightly.  My mom was outside with me and she saw the same thing.  Slight greenish hue to them.  They disappeared after about 15 seconds and, due to the sun, I could not see them anymore.;42.3725409090909;-71.1813954545454
