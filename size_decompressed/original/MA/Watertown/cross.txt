Lighted object hovers over Watertown Square.;2003-05-29 04:45:00;10 minutes;Lighted object hovers over Watertown Square. The object was sort of cross like, and there were 3 large lights that could be seen.  In this sense, the shape was maybe like 2 ears, lit, an eye on the forehead, lit, and no fourth light.  The lights were crime light colored and the object hovered.  It was very close, maybe 30 stories high.  I could only see the lights, and they suggested a helicopter shaped figure, but THERE WAS NO NOISE AT ALL, and it seemed to be emitting beams of light that were filtered by the fog/mist in the air!!!  It changed direction and lifted away.  It was a foggy morning, and I was out for my morening bike ride when I noticed this object hovering in the sky at a very close distance from me.;42.3725409090909;-71.1813954545454
