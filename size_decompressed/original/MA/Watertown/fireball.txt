A fast-moving, illuminated object crossed the sky.  I could not tell how far away it was and it appeared to be about 350 feet above the ground.  It looked like a fireball (orange, red and white), but clearly there were no flames it was illuminated.   I live in a suburban neighborhood. I ran to the window to watch and at the treeline it plunged about 75-100 feet in a split second and continued out of sight.  I opened the window, but heard no motor or sound.  About 5 minutes later, it or another similar object crossed the same area in the sky and at the same rate of speed.  With the window opened I heard nothing.;42.3725409090909;-71.1813954545454
Bright green fireball seen in sky over Watertown, MA.;2015-11-01 17:10:00;1 second;Bright green fireball seen in sky over Watertown MA I saw a bright green light move very quickly across the sky from high up on the right down towards the left.  It was brighter and larger than the light of a commercial jet or plane (there are many in the sky in the area due to the proximity to Logan International Airport).   The green light was high up in the sky to the right and moved quickly downwards to the left, in a matter of one second or less.;42.3725409090909;-71.1813954545454
