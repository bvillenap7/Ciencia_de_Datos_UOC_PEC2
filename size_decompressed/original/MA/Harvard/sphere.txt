Sorry no police that I know of, but one correction officer.  That would by me. It was a beautiful fall day, (sat.)  I just got off work at concord prison.  So I decided to take the longer way home. When I got by a scenic lookout a place called friutland musem.  There were cars,about 8 to 10 and they were parked all askew, and people were pointing out over the overlook.  So I looked were they were pointing and there was this bright silver sauce shaped disk just stationary in the sky.  I watched it for a time then it just disappeared.  I was so shocked I drove away without asking anyone if they saw the same thing. To this day it bothers me that I didn't get names.  I was wondering if anyone else reported that. I might be off on the exact date but it was a Saturday in he fall of 1988.;42.4979;-71.5712
