Meteor-type object travel up-ward, out of wooded area.;2004-02-17 23:45:00;3 or 4 seconds;Meteor-type object travel up-ward, out of wooded area. As I was driving home from Boston on Rt. 2 West, I saw what appeared to be a meteor. The odd thing about this is that the object was rising out of the woods to my left and accelerated into the sky. The object was about 1/4 mile away and left the woods with a sky-ward trajectory at a great rate.;42.4979;-71.5712
