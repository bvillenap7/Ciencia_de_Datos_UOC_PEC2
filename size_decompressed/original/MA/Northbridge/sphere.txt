2 Darting UFOs, stationary at non-fixed intervals.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Sirius??  PD));2005-05-11 21:45:00;one hour;2 Darting UFOs, stationary at non-fixed intervals. My girlfriend and I went outside to look at the stars on may 11, 2005 at 21:45. We stood in her driveway only 20 feet from the house and began pointing out the common constalations.  We saw a faint light darting across the sky, it may have moved a half inch or so from our location at a time. We first thought it was a plane. We dismissed this after watching it for one or two minutes. The movements were too irregular to be an airplane.  It made quick, movements moving only a half inch or so at a time. It moved left, right, up, down, and every way inbetween. The object would be stationary at non-fixed interavals.  At this point we went back into the house. We called for my girlfriend's father. He came outside. At this point we all noticed the a brighter, possibly closer object demonstrating the same movements. My girlfriends father went inside.  My girlfriend and I followed him into the house and got her old teloscope and binoqulars. We assembled the teloscope, at this point it was 22:30 roughly, and the object were stationary for longer periods of time. The teloscope and binoqulars didn't help very much. They were old and too dirty. The objects were clearly round in shape. We continued to observes them until 24:10 roughly, and as time passed the objects were stationary for longer and longer periods of time.  We ploted out the points, marking a place of referrence and used a one peak of my girlfriends roof to mark the object to the left and a large pine tree to mark the object to the right. I had to get home, so we decided to call it a night and check it the following evening, which would be 21:45 on may 12, 2005.  I will repond again if we see it again. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the witnesses may have been looking at the star, Sirius.  PD));42.151;-71.6467
