Plane crash?;2014-07-22 22:00:00;1 minute;Plane crash? Was driving along Rt 2 headed west from Acton toward boxborough/Harvard before passing under 495, witnessed what appeared to be a plane falling rapidly from the sky.   Scared me because I thought it would crash onto the highway, but nothing.......have no idea what it could have been, as I see nothing about any plane crashes occurring in this vicinity.
