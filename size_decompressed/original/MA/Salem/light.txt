Three Orange Lights In Salem Moving Fast With Random Course Change.;2003-08-01 00:20:00;5 seconds;Three Orange Lights In Salem Moving Fast With Random Course Change. I was over a friends house talking, and at the same time I was looking up at the sky looking for shooting stars (as I often do).  I pointed to my friend and said look at that one, its bright and I  was convinced that it was a shooting star until in made a random course change.  The object looked about the size of an airplane flying high. But the lighting was too bright indicating that it was closer than that.  it moved from the center of my viewable area in the sky to the horizon in about 5 seconds, and made a hard turn to the right through a set of clouds, but continued in the same direction....heading south towards marblehead.  The object looked to have three lights on the front in a triangle shape, the lighting was orange.  It definalty taveled through the clouds because the clouds were illuminated as it passed through.  It moved way to fast to be a plane. I have never seen something move that fast in the sky. Maybe it was a meteor from the sky and I mistook the course correction, or it was something unknown.  But whatever it was, It kinda scares me a little.  I thought I would make an effort to report this in case there was another sighting.  Thanks!;42.5181;-70.8989999999999

Three orbs spotted over Salem Ma;2020-11-23 16:00:00;3-5 mins;Three orbs spotted over Salem Ma At 4pm I saw 3 orbs, white in color over the Salem Ma DPW building. Two were flying side by side, the other was swooping around them at sharp angles that do not seem possible for a helicopter to perform. The grouped two, meanwhile were flying as if they were racing, one constantly overtaking the other, and the other responding in kind. After around 5 minutes the two of them disappeared behind the clouds. The third was quick to follow.;42.5181;-70.8989999999999
