multiple lights on election day 2004;2004-11-02 18:00:00;10 min;multiple lights on election day 2004 Coming back from voting (i went right after work) i went out on my deck for a cigarette and saw multiple (maybe 8) glowing lights showing through the cloud cover. the sun was already set so it was not the sun and i later checked my astrology software and the moon was on the other side of the earth at that time.no stars were visible--just these lights, hovering in a line, possibly a V formation heading west  at least at airplane level. i heard no sound. i am very familiar with airplanes since i see them fly by all the time from logan airport. there was no tell-tale airplane signal. just large areas of light moving behind the clouds. i watched them until they slowly faded (possible they were lifting up higher above the clouds) i will send in a simulation of what i saw, i didnt have a camera on me at the time.;42.0035;-70.847
