3 Orange Fireballs in triangle formation;2010-08-28 09:15:00;2 minutes;3 Orange Fireballs in triangle formation My wife and I were driving down the road and my wife spotted an orange light up in the sky that looked like a fireball and when i looked up I noticed 2 more and it appeared like they were lined up in a triangle formation.   We pulled over a half mile up the road into a driveway and got out and only saw one of the lights due to the fact there are many trees in the area.  The objects appeared to be traveling east and not very fast.;42.5811;-71.4387
