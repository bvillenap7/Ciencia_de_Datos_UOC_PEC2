The craft was south of me, a mile or so from where I was. the craft seemed to dive from a hovering point about a few hundred feet in the air because that’s where the streak started. This was no man made craft, it might sound weird but it’s almost like it knew I looked at it then dove super fast the exact moment I saw it. I stayed for a few more minutes and tried to catch another glimpse but that was it. Have never seen anything like it and felt compelled to share;42.5811;-71.4387
