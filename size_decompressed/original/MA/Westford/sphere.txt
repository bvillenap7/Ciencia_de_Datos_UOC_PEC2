Yellow sphere about half the size of the moon with dark rings floating in the northern sky.;2003-06-19 21:00:00;20 minutes;Yellow sphere about half the size of the moon with dark rings floating in the northern sky. Driving home from a CPR training session, I was coming down Main Street going north.  In two places on this ride, I saw a glowing yellow sphere with what looked to be darker rings around it right about the line of trees.  It was about half the size of the moon and seemed to be staying stationary.  I ran home to get my video camera and went back to one of the locations from which I observed this UFO.  I parked my car and grabbed my camera.  I spotted the craft in the sky, and I hit the switch to turn on my video camera.  Almost simultaneously, the yellow sphere began to move west in the sky, before I could capture any footage of it.  I frantically went to the other location where I had seen it, but it was no longer in sight.  There were no other higher vantage points in the area that I could try to again spot the UFO.;42.5811;-71.4387
