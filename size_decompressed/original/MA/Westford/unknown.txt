Bright object in sky suddenly switched direction, faded and dissapeared.;2010-07-11 21:00:00;20 seconds;Bright object in sky suddenly switched direction, faded and dissapeared. ISS went over head about 21:20 EST.  Approx two minutes later another large bright light decended from a Westerly direction.  It was coming toward the earth and it grew larger and brighter very quickly.  So much so that I was nervous that it might strike the earth.   It had no shape we could see just a very bright light that was similar in size and brightness to the ISS that had just gone past minutes earlier (from a WNW direction.)   This object was as bright if not brighter than the ISS.   Suddenly it switched direction back out into space and faded very very quickly and finally dissapeared out of site. I know it was not a metorite or other debris burning up because of this change in direction.  I know it was not the ISS as that had just passed two minutes prior to seeing this.  I know it was not a satellite passing by as we have seen those many many times before.  This was not any of these things and both my husband and I  witnessed it.   Thanks for looking into it as we are curious as to what it was.;42.5811;-71.4387
