Brilliant Green Orb like Light.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor??  PD));2012-08-25 05:55:00;3 seconds;Brilliant Green Orb like Light During my morning commute I observed the following:  Orb like light in a brilliant green color (florescent) moving in a non linear fashion then quickly vanishing right before my eyes.  It was daylight at the time and I would estimate it was flying low, no higher than a telephone pole across the intersection of the red light I was stopped at.  There was no sound and it did not appear to be on fire as it was a brilliant green from start to the moment it vanished.
