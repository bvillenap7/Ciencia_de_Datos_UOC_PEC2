Moving forward and flying low. Lights blue, yellow, green.  Was not revolving but instead moving like a plane would but it was much faster and smooth, no noise produced by the craft.  Also seemed like the back if the craft had a propulsion thing because as the craft moved forward the back of the air (not the craft) of it appeared blurry ( something you would see like in the movies, or like a strong magnetic field)   This is my second sighting within 5 days.;42.4279999999999;-71.0618000000001
