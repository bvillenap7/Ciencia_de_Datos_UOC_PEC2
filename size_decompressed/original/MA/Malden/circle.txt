Dear Peter, Since April 11th, 2020, every night from the 21st of April, I have filmed and photographed spinning circular balls of light of colors ranging from yellow, orange and purplish blue. Each stays hovering yet move position and will randomly flash larger or dimmer as filming. The rareness of my recording and report is that it is happening every night filming 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, and yes tonight the 27 Th of April. I have hours of videos saved and intend on filming every night I can saving the Videos and taking photos. South east is the direction I see these lights spinning and hovering. They are low to the horizon yet must be out of reach of our air force to practically fly close to them. I will keep filming and take full responsibility for my truth in this report. I have 3 witnesses that see these every night as I do. Contact me in a week or moth and see how much more videos and photos I can film. Fascinating at least and I believe they are probes observing our planet?;42.4279999999999;-71.0618000000001
