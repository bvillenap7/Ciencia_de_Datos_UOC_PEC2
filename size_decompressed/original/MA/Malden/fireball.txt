Orange light/Fireball seen around Boston Logan route area.;2017-09-24 23:30:00;3 minutes;Orange light/Fireball seen around Boston Logan route area I was walking home from work around 23:30 when I turned left into my street and notice this light appearing in the horizon, at first it looked like a airplane catching fire but it wasn’t going straight down, so i thought it was a falling star…  I was wrong again...  The object made a U turn and started to fade away until it desapear completely.  It didn’t flash, was slow, moved gently, and didn’t leave a trace.;42.4279999999999;-71.0618000000001
