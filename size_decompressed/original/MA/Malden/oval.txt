I ran to the window looking into the sky expecting to see a plane on fire. The blast was very loud and a plane explosion is the first thing that came to mind. When I scanned the sky line I noticed a bright oval glowing light in the sky. I then stepped back to open the window to get a better look and when I looked back in the area the light was gone.  I then turned on my police scanner and the dispatch was getting numerous 911 calls (around 30 from what I heard) from people in the area. All reporting a bright blue flash that came with the blasts. From the calls it seems to be that the callers ranged about a 1/2 mile in distance.  The Police scanned the area for 2 hours. And also contacted the Power Companies to see if any transformers had blown. All seemed to be ok, and the Police could not pin point the area of the blast.  Lights did not flicker at all so I ruled out a transformer blast early on. The 2 blasts sounded like a sonic boom, but the blue flash does not match up to a boom of that nature.  I hope this report helps in some way. I cannot explain what happened last night, but neither can the police.;42.4279999999999;-71.0618000000001
Large very bright (white) oval shaped object with big red light and center and green lights around;2008-07-12 21:50:00;2-3 Mins;Large very bright (white) oval shaped object with big red light and center and green lights around I was standing in my balcony looking west and I saw a huge brightly coloured object, too colourful and it moved from left to right in the night sky.  It had a big red light at the center and small green lights around. But the objects has a whole appeared bright white.No other colors. It was moving constantly but not too fast. I saw the object for 2-3 mins before it disappeared out of sight.  It was relatively very low height and appeared more than the size of plane. I never seen such a object in the sky and naturally very excited, googled Report UFO sighting and contacted UFO center immediately. I did not take photo / video of the object. :(;42.4279999999999;-71.0618000000001
