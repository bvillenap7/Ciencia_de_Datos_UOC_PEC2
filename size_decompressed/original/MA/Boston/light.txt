two very bright lights shone through the rear window of a parked car, rose up and went into the sky.;1977-11-17 19:00:00;5 minutes;two very bright lights shone through the rear window of a parked car, rose up and went into the sky. On or about 17 November 1977, I was sitting in a parked car with an acquaintance on a major thoroughfare in Boston, in front of my apartment building.  It was nighttime and pitch-black except for a few stars.  We had been parked and talking for about 15-20 minutes when we both noticed the headlights of a parked car directly behind us coming through the rear window of his car.  The lights were extremely bright and it was annoying and we both mentioned it to each other.  We were thinking that one of us would get out of the car and go speak to the driver and ask him to turn off his headlights.  Before we could do that, as we were watching the 'headlights' of the 'car' parked behind us, to our astonishment the pair of 'headlights' rose directly perpendicular, passing out of sight over the roof of our car and moved on a tangential line high into the sky.  The lights made no sound, no vibration or other distinguishing thing.  I am not a good judge of distances but it may have been about 1/2-mile up when the pair of lights seemed to blend into one.  The light moved in an irregular but angular motion (without what I understand is the banking movement of conventional aircraft).  The white light changed into various colors.  This display lasted about a minute or so and then the thing disappeared.  The whole incident was absolutely shocking.  My friend and I realized how close we might have come to something 'more', and it was very disturbing.  There is no such thing as an automobile doing what those lights did.  My acquaintance was severely unnerved and said goodbye to me.  He said he wouldn't be associating with me any further, as if I was somehow responsible for what we both saw.  I have not had contact with him since that night.  I only saw the two 'headlights', which appeared to be and were mistaken for car headlights, which gives an idea of their approximate size.  I have not discussed this event until now.  I was watching some video clips of Bill Birnes reporting various UFO incidents on the internet over the past several nights and decided I would like to get this incident off my mind.  I was a sophomore in college at the time it seems to me that I was old enough to know what I was seeing, and besides, I wasn't alone.;42.3516667302195;-71.0643806482362
star like object getting brighter and brighter and then moving slowly out of sight;1999-05-05 03:00:00;5 min;star like object getting brighter and brighter and then moving slowly out of sight I went up on the roof of my Chinatown apartment at 3 am. It seemed to be cloudy as only two stars could be seen, one almost diretly overhead and a very bright one in the ssw sky at aprox. 40 degrees above the horiz. I was looking at what I thought was this star in the southern sky when it quickly doubled it's brightness and seemed to get a bit bigger too, this happened again, and then again, until it seemed to have rays of light coming off of it as one might draw a star. I ran down stairs to get my roomate and brought her up on the roof within a few minutes. I pointed to it and told her what happened. It began to move slowly toward the east and was soon obscurred by a building. She insisted it was a plane. We both went inside at this point and went to bed.;42.3516667302195;-71.0643806482362
Bright light moving quickly east to west viewed from the boston common;2000-06-27 22:40:00;10 seconds;Bright light moving quickly east to west viewed from the boston common In the boston common walking away from the public gardens towards the park st station, my girlfriend and I noticed a fast moving light heading east to west in the sky.  The approach for commercial planes was directly over the common heading due east, the opposite direction of which way the light was moving.  It was clearly not a helicopter for it made no sound resembling a helicopter, although it was possible this object was too high to hear the sound if it made one. It was visible for about ten seconds at about a 40 degree angle in the southern sky of where we at that particular point (the exact location of the sighting was about 100 yards north of the gate which across the st. is the public garden, the path next to the softball field).   if anyone else saw this object and can explain it or give more detail on it, feel free to email me.;42.3516667302195;-71.0643806482362
Boston sighting..Wednesday 2/7 at around 8:45 PM;2001-02-07 20:45:00;5 minutes;Boston sighting..Wednesday 2/7 at around 8:45 PM ok, last night, Wednesday,  my friend and I saw something strange. One really bright light, which i thought was Venus or something.It was stable and really bright, very high in the sky.About 1 minute later, a second light appeared right next to the other bright light, equally bright. My friend suggested it might be a wing-light to a plane that was turning directions or something, but as he said that, the lights dimmed and began moving quickly in different directions. They were moving pretty fast and eventually they began following each other but at a distance, changing to much dimmer lights. They were not planes. I know that. The initial light I saw was as bright a light as i've ever seen in the sky. Did anyone see that in the Boston area last night? I'm at a loss of what it was and have no clue what it could be?;42.3516667302195;-71.0643806482362
Jet's Chasing Lights in Sky Over Boston;2001-02-13 13:25:00;2 Minutes from my view;Jet's Chasing Lights in Sky Over Boston Driving into Boston from the North near the airport, I saw 2 jet's leaving trails headed toward each other directly over the city high in the sky. Underneath them appeared a light which flickered and then glowed intensly before suddenly disappearing. After about a second or 2 it re-appeared in what must of been 20 miles to the east over the ocean. It remained there for maybe 10 seconds or so and then glowed brighter and vanished. The light was white and it did seem like it was flickering or hazy but it was really strange how it glowed before it vanished each time. After the second time I couldn't find it again (I wanted to pull over but was on an expressway) I noticed one of the planes had stopped leaving trails (I'm assuming to make a turn) I don't know if anyone else saw it but I intend to watch the news tonight. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the witness via telephone, and we found him to be quite credible.  We do not think he was looking at a mylar balloon, but we do not know what it was he observed.

Bright orb shaped light over Boson;2002-02-19 08:40:00;2min;Bright orb shaped light over Boson Running in a South East direction I saw a bright white orb shaped light. It moved as though it were heading upwards but vertically. Saw it dim as it passed through a very thin veil of clouds. Otherwise a very clear, sunny day. During a morning run I see a lot of aircraft coming into Logan. This was very high up and way too bright for a plane. The proportion would have been different. As was the case when a European airline on it's way to NY or Chicago flew over the same location serveral minutes later and was barely visible except for it's comtrail. The object in question had no trail. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous.  No other reports from this area of the country for this date.  We wonder whether the witness is simply describing the Sun.  PD)) ((FOLLOW-UP MESSAGE FROM WITNESS)) You doubt the poeple who post here now???? Look, how stupid do think I am? I read your little note at the bottom of my report and it says maybe the witness was looking at the sun???? I assure you I know what the sun looks like and this thing was nowhere close to it in size or behavior. I think I mentioned it was a clear day... If you REALLY want to know what I saw, check back to 8/01 on your report logs. A woman in a car in rush hour traffic, about two miles from me, saw exactly the same thing. I got a chill reading it. Someone said it made the news here but I'm not sure if that's true. The sun! Please. ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witness saw, but we at first allowed for the possibility that the report might be a hoax, to see if we would buy into posting a sighting report about the Sun.

My friend and I were walking back from a night class and we saw a bright light hovering very high in the sky.

Bright white/red light over Boston then fades out;2005-11-14 21:15:00;10 minutes;Bright white/red light over Boston then fades out I live on a hill about three miles south of the downtown area of Boston and look at the city almost due North.  In the winter we lose the leaves that obscure the skyline in front of our kitchen windows. I'd say we are about 3-4 stories high.  Now that the leaves have fallen we can see the city pretty easily through he tree branches.  Since it was a clear night out and we were cooking dinner I was in my kitchen and looking out at the sky line and sky - we eat late.  I could see the typical air-traffic approaching Logan as well as the high altitude military and international flights that go over Boston daily.   Immediately my attention was drawn to a VERY bright  white light, slight reddish hued edges at first, that seemed like an approaching airliner but it didn't move, or so I thought.  It was very twinkly.  Wondering if it was a star or a planet I continued to look at it until I noticed, thanks to the position of the tree branches, that the light was indeed moving but very slowly (there was little to no wind outside).  I called out to another person in the kitchen to come to the window and have a look.  He saw it immediately (you'd have to be legally blind to miss it) and he was at a loss as to what it could be since he saw that it was indeed moving but more so like hovering.  He went to see to dinner and I kept watching.  Suddenly it got brighter and I could see on both the left, right, and the bottom edge, the light became more oblong, that there were two red lights that could be seen partially through the bright white in the center.  The other person heard me yell out and came to see it too.  Just as suddenly as it brightened it started to dim.  The white light part turned all red and just faded out til it was gone -  like CRT TV's that have the center dot that fades out.  The whole time typical aircraft were flying above and near(ish) the object.  It was much larger and brighter than any of them regardless of altitude.  Thinking it was a star, I thought I would try and see if it was there the next night.  Venus and Mars have been pretty big in the sky over the last months so I thought I'd wait until I could rule it out.  Of course it was cloudy the next two nights but the third night was crystal clear (11/17/05).  Not one star would have even come close as to rule it one in the same.  Not that you can see a ton in the city anyway.  There were none in the area where this seem to be in the sky.  As a point of reference, the Prudential Tower was directly below it's position.  From my point of view I'd guess the light was 40 degrees altitude/10 degrees azimuth.;42.3516667302195;-71.0643806482362
Fleet of Star-like objects witnessed over Boston.;2005-12-02 20:57:00;10 seconds;Fleet of Star-like objects witnessed over Boston. At 8:57 pm on Friday December 2, 2005 I was standing on my back deck in South Boston.  It was clear night and I was looking at the stars.  I noticed a star moving North across the sky.  My first impression was that it was a satilite, it was pretty high up - I then scanned right/South and saw approximately 11-14 similar objects moving in the same direction as the first object.  The objects did not seem to be in formation, however they we clustered/grouped and a number of the objects on the perimeter were moving/swirving in and out of the group.  After the group of objects passed, there was a brighter star-object that followed in the same path.  The trajectory of the objects was right over Logan Airport.  There were planes in the sky at the same time as the event.  Through my observation, I can confidently say they were not meteors/planes/blimps/etc.. They were lighted, circular star-like objects - moving at a very high altitude, all following the same path.;42.3516667302195;-71.0643806482362

Bright light in the sky;2008-08-25 20:00:00;10 minutes;My boyfriend, our friend, and I were sitting on our second floor front deck that looks out towards the Peter's Hill section of the The Arnold Arboretum in Jamaica Plain (an area of Boston proper) having dinner. Our house is up on a hill so we can see well over the few rooftops below us that look to the South West sky towards Needham and Route 128/95 - it's all tree tops from the park looking towards the horizon. As we were eating I looked up to speak to my BF and a very bright light in the sky behind him caught my eye - it wasn't there a minute before. No other stars were out since the horizon was a pale yellow and the sky above shades of blue - it was just starting dusk - but not nearly dark yet and a very clear night. I pointed out the light and the two people saw it and agreed it was really bright  - and stationary in the sky. They were puzzled by it as was I. I said it's probably a planet but I'll watch it and see if it moves across the sky. I would estimate it was 20-30 degrees above the horizon. I observed it for about eight minutes without it moving in the slightest. I then went inside to grab something from the kitchen (maybe 15 seconds) and when I returned it was nowhere in sight... and it couldn't have possibly moved behind something since we were so high up and could see for miles around it - nothing would have obstructed the view. It just vanished. We didn't see it again. Other aircraft were visible and easily identifiable and nowhere near this light. No sound was heard but that's not surprising seeing how we felt it was miles away.  We are all professional men and women. Ph.d., Actuary and an I.T. Director. None of us were inebriated.;42.3516667302195;-71.0643806482362

I was watching the eastern sky towards the Atlantic ocean and i noticed a very very bright light maybe around 4 to 5,000 feet in the sky.  I looked at it and i disappeared for about twenty seconds and the it simple just vanished.  Then about twenty seconds later the light appeared but much higher than the first sighting and not in the same location. It was to high to be any type of aircraft.  For about another ten to fifteen seconds the light was moving very slow then it just simply just vanished again. The color of the light was very strange and I couldn't really describe the color. I want to say maybe a combo of red and yellow,It was just a very bright steady light. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

In Boston, Massachusetts, at around 9:20 am  (sic.  p.m.), I saw a white light traveling from east-southeast to west-northwest.  It was about twice as large and bright as the few stars visible through light pollution and clouds.   It flashed once about a quarter of the way across the sky.  At around the middle of the sky its path crossed two others, similar in size, traveling from the opposite direction, though not parallel.   Their trajectories didn’t meet exactly, but when they were close they shook slightly, and continued on their paths.   All were visible until below the horizon, which was obstructed by trees and buildings.  There was at least one plane in the sky during this, to the north and heading west.;42.3516667302195;-71.0643806482362
Hovering white light orb above and to the east of the Hyatt Hotel near the Prudential Center in Boston’s Back Bay.;2015-05-01 21:30:00;<30 seconds;Three students (myself included) simultaneously observed a large, hovering white light orb above and to the east of the Hyatt Hotel near the Prudential Center in Boston’s Back Bay.  The orb remained perfectly stationary for about 10-15 seconds then, at a speed unknown to anyone present, dropped and vanished behind a nearby building.  It took our breath away and one witness let out a scream.   The size of the orb and intensity of the light gave the impression of nearness—it seemed to be no more than a quarter of a mile away. There was no accompanying noise.  We walked in the direction of the occurrence and found no evidence of aircraft, fireworks, drone, spotlight, etc...   Immediately after the orb dropped a brief period of silence was experienced by everyone in the group, not only the witnesses.

Multiple Amber-Red lights over South Boston heading North over Boston-Logan International Airport.;2016-09-22 19:40:00;15 minutes;Multiple Amber-Red lights over South Boston heading North over Boston-Logan International Airport. It was about an hour after sunset, I was getting relieved from watch and happened to look out of the window to the ESE and caught 3 amber-red lights heading North towards Boston Logan International Airport at approximately 1,500-2,500 feet in a triangle formation one of the trailing lights made a sudden maneuver and crossed the other that was trailing and proceeded North As the lights crossed in front of me and headed away, the lights faded out as they were closing on the the airport. It was after I had lost the first three that I looked back to the South and saw more lights in no particular formation, but on the same heading and altitude, about 15-20 went by in total.  By the time these showed up, 5 other witnesses had spotted them from below my vantage and confirmed what I had seen.  On the level I was, there had been another witness as well.  Also, of note was a cruise ship that had departed and been in the channel fairly close by at the time. There were no clouds, but I could not make out any stars prior to or during the event winds minimal and temperature mild. The lights moved at a steady speed, approximately 50-70 knots, a steady altitude, and in full unison towards the North. No sounds could be heard emanating from them, or other lights.  Shape and exact size could not be determined. The lights/what they were attached to were clearly under intelligent control whether it is ours or not I can not say. I was able to get two cell phone videos but they did not catch very well the extent of what I saw. I did notice that after all of the lights had passed, a helicopter had followed close behind and proceeded towards the North, but avoiding Logan airspace-it did not appear military and was plainly visible.  It should be noted that these lights continued through Logan airspace without regard to it. Of note is that a line of landing airplanes could be seen coming from the North and landing at Logan-very close together and I had not seen them do this for the two months I had been here-once the objects passed, some planes had refrained from touching down and began to gain altitude to continue their flights.;42.3516667302195;-71.0643806482362

I've never seen anything I couldn't identify before, no ufo sightings of any kind, so this was extremely strange and left me somewhat shaken.
