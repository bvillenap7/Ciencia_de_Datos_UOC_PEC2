Dark shape landed on roof top, than flew away as bright light, no sound.;2012-03-30 04:00:00;5 minutes;Dark shape landed on roof top, than flew away as bright light, no sound. I was working security on t4he 30th of March, 2012 for the MCHC on Blue Hill Ave. in Mattapan (Boston) along with a co-worker. At approximately 4:00am I noticed a large dark shape, almost like smoke on the building directly next to the health center on the roof. The object or entity appeared to glide along the roof top and stop for a few moments. I could see what looked like eyes and got the distinct impression whatever it was new I was looking at. After about 3 min of observing it, it gained a tremendous amount of speed and jumped or flew off the building. I than observed it. I’m not sure if the object was generating light or if it was the reflection of the moon on it, but it was a observable bright light flying in an odd pattern of an up and down, side to side motion. It was headed in the direction of Milton and Quincy. I than rejoined my co-worker in her car and told her I just saw the strangest thing. She replied “you mean that dark, misty, looking thing that was on that roof over there?” I couldn’t believe she saw the exact same thing and described it before I even said anything.;42.3516667302195;-71.0643806482362
While at the beach with my family I noticed 4 military helicopter flying low, across Boston.  This is unusual so I took a picture.;2015-08-02 14:00:00;3 minutes;While at the beach with my family I noticed 4 military helicopter flying low, across Boston. This is unusual, so I took a pic with my phone.   When I looked at pic, there was something I.  The image that you could not see with the naked eye ? So I took a few more pics of sky only to see something in pics that no one could see with their eyes.  I thought it was worth reporting, first the military heli's the. Something weird above them, it seems to have an aura of maybe heat around it, so do the heli's?  But it's close to their size?   If someone would like to contact me I could maybe send pics but not sending them around just to everyone, I googled where to report and found this sight.;42.3516667302195;-71.0643806482362
>30 glowing specks in a massive group flying north from the east over the ocean.;2015-09-27 20:00:00;~15;&gt30 glowing specs in a massive group flying north from the east over the ocean This was too far east over the ocean to be coming from any land strips.  At first I thought it could have been a bunch of those candle lanterns released from a boat, but there were far too many, and they were moving far too fast.   It then looked like an arsenal of planes, however their flight pattern was too random.   These objects were specs, but were glowing like breathing bright and then dull slowly, and there were at least 30, maybe more.
