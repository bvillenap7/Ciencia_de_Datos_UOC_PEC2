Bright fiery elongated object seen in sky northeast of Boston Ma, on Sept 8, 2015 at 6 am.;2015-09-08 06:00:00;10 minutes;Bright fiery elongated object seen in sky northeast of Boston Ma, on Sept 8, 2015 at 6 am. Driving to work at 6 AM, heading North on route 24 towards Brockton, MA, saw orange/pink wide streak in sky.  It looked like it was northeast and possibly over or near Atlantic Ocean.  It was slowly working its way downward.   I watched it until I could no longer see it behind the trees.  I don't think it was a craft.   It looked fiery, but perfectly formed in a wide line that was rectangular. It had beautiful colors.;42.3516667302195;-71.0643806482362
