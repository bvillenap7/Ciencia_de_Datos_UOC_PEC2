The object had the shape of a comet or large meteorite, with a “head” about 1/2 lunar diameter and a “tail” about 3 lunar diameters in size. It passed at a high rate of speed from right to left, in a generally North or Northeast direction, also moving downward at about a 30 degree angle relative to the horizon.  It was visible to me for less than a second. What made it highly unusual to me was its color.  It appeared to be a consistant shade of green, perhaps yellow green, bright, almost of a flourescent quality.  The surface of both the object and its tail appeared mottled, broken up by dark patches between the green.  It had the appearance of something colored by a flourescent pen on an animation gel, with no variation in color aside from the mottled appearance.  The mottling and the detail of the object’s tail appeared to be changing slightly as it quickly passed, convincing me it was no reflection. It did appear to be travelling beneath the cloud cover, indicating a fairly low altitude.  Under that cloud cover, I had clear visibility well beyond the range of the object, which I would guess to be 1/2 to 1 mile away. This is only the second time I have seen anything like this...my only other sighting was well over 30 years ago, consisting of a group of star-like objects moving in formation, seen by three other witnesses at that time. I have no idea even how to categorize what I saw...Is this one of the “fireball” objects I have heard about? Would be very interested to get feedback on this, even if it is commonplace among your reports. Thank you for your service...it is appreciated. Notes:  I would be willing to accept a collect call if you feel it is worth the time. Best time to call would be between 8 AM and 1 PM EST.  That would be 5-10 AM PST. Alternatively, I will also answer any email.;42.3516667302195;-71.0643806482362

It was the about 1/4 size of the full moon streaking across (arching) the sky.  It seemed to break up, and get smaller the closer it got to the horizon, it also appeared first as a fiery ball and then broke down (got smaller and smaller with a tail.)  I have seen shooting stars before, but,never this large or bright.  I posted this on a photography website, asking if anyone else saw this--no one did.  I was told it was probably a shooting star or meteror...;42.3516667302195;-71.0643806482362

It came down pretty fast and all a sudden it went down some were over the ocean.   I tried to take a picture of of but I was not able to en time.

Orange blurry fireball observed flying over Boston during the early evening. Flying South over Allston.;2011-12-09 21:00:00;2-3 min;Orange blurry fireball observed flying over Boston during the early evening. Flying South over Allston. My roommates and I (we are all engineering students), were on our deck, and I noticed an orange object coming in our direction.  The object was moving south-southeast and flew directly over us. No real definition of shape could be made out other than the fact that it was glowing and flickering. The shape seemed to be an oval or circular type shape.   Initially we suspected a possible plane on fire or something of that nature, but the plane was flying AWAY from the airport and not falling in altitude.  Constant speed was maintained. I'm not able to say exactly how fast it was moving, but it was fairly quick.  About 30 seconds after flying directly over us, the object steered in the south-southwestern direction and seemed to gain stay very horizontal. My most detailed memory of the event is when the object flew directly over us and it seemed to be on fire. It was fairly low altitude.  The object was also very blurry.;42.3516667302195;-71.0643806482362

Reddish orange orb floating through the sky.;2014-09-27 19:00:00;30 seconds;Reddish orange orb floating through the sky. Me and  my mother were driving north bound on i93 over the bridge coming from quincy into boston when we both noticed what could only be  initially described as a kite on fire BUT after taking into consideration the time of day (6 pm) and the fact that it was moving south at what seemed to be 20 to 40 mph at what seemed to be 40 to 100 feet i the air. This was very strange and fascinating.  I'm both perplexed and compelled to find out what that was!!!;42.3516667302195;-71.0643806482362

At first I looked from my window, then outside and when I came back inside and looked out the window again it had disappeared.
