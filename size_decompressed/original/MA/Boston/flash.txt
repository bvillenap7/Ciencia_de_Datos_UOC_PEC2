Driving on the highway, the sky is very clear with no clouds at all a streak of light appears across the sky and flashes down about 100 feet and it disappears after exploding into a colorful ball (the first flash was a red colored light, the second was  a teal colored light).   There were only two flashes seen, about two hours apart from each other.  The shape was a thin, rectangular shape and a spherical ball of light right before the streaks disappeared.;42.3516667302195;-71.0643806482362
