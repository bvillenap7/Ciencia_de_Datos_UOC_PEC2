At approximately, 04:20 hours, I was sitting with friends on a fire escape when we noticed fast moving lights in the sky.  The lights were green colored, moved independently and would, at times, converge into a cross formation.  The spectacle lasted about 20 minutes at which the lights dimmed and vanished from the sky.;42.3516667302195;-71.0643806482362
