Boston Harbor light show;1977-06-24 01:00:00;10-15 min.;Boston Harbor light show    Several of us were outside the Boston aquarium, looking into the clear night sky over Boston Harbor when we witnessed a fairly extensive display of light lasting several minutes. The phenomina included a single sphere of light ranging from light gold to pure white and varied from barely visible to, at one point, bright enough that it lit up the entire harbor so that we could see our shadows from what could have been several miles away! 	Mostly flying in linear patterns which at times teased what appeared to be military fighter jets, the ball of light seemed to accelorate and decelorate either immediatly or at rates reflecting an absense of enertial consequense. When it finally left the area it did so at a constant rate of acceloration far beyond the capability of the jets. The demonstration of so many inconsistancies with what I had previously considered possible left me sure i was being left out of some informational loop. Date is best guess ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));42.3516667302195;-71.0643806482362
It was gold and round about the size of a golfball.;1978-06-15 03:00:00;5 minutes;It was gold and round about the size of a golfball. We were on top of a 5 story building working on removing a tar and gravel roof. It had to have looked like a landing pad with all the flood lights we used to illuminate the area we were stripping. When I went to my friend ,hey look at that! Do you see that little golden thing up there? He said yes, I see it! It was about the size of a golf ball,gold in color with a glow or haze and it just hovered motionless about 2 feet above our heads. It made no noise. I tried to grab it and it moved so fast to avoid me you couldn't see it. Then it hovered again seeemingly just watching us. So I tried a couple more times to catch it and it kept moving away then it would stop and hover as if it was a game. Then after about 5 minutes it took off straight up and out of our sight. We agreed not to tell anyone about this. But my friend died in a bad car accident and I can't keep this a secret anymore . ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

UFO spotted above Charles River during July 4th fireworks (1998);1998-07-04 22:00:00;Unsure;UFO spotted above Charles River during July 4th fireworks (1998) Hi, well, i was at charles river on july 4th watching the fireworks, sitting up on my dads shoulder. I was looking up (well, who wouldnt be with all the fireworks?) and then i saw an orange flying saucer (aka UFO) at least im pretty sure it was orange. It had some sort of weird language on the outside i think and it was glowing. I could have sworn it was going to land because it got very close to the ground but then it went back up again.

Large spherical object floating over the Charles River amid the smoke following a Fourth of July Fireworks display.;1998-07-04 23:00:00;2 minutes;Large spherical object floating over the Charles River amid the smoke following a Fourth of July Fireworks display. It was July 4th 1998, and I was at a roofdeck party on Beacon Hill in Boston with many friends.  We had just heard the Boston Pops play from the Esplanade (a large park area that borders the Charles River on the Boston side) and had seen the fireworks display.  The show ended approximately 23:00.  I was standing with three other friends looking out over the river and noticed that there were two spotlights on the Cambridge side of the river waving across the sky.  One of them stopped moving so I was wondering who was operating them.  Students perhaps?  An old MIT prank?  Anyway, that was what made me look in that direction.  While I was observing this I also noticed all the smoke from the fireworks slowly drifting over the river toward Boston Harbor.  While I was observing the spotlights and smoke, I noticed a spherical shape floating discreetly among the clouds of smoke.  The sphere had no lights, no sound, and when one of the beams of the spotlights hit the object I noticed it was silverish metallic with a raised ridge going around its equator.  I called my friends' attention to what I was seeing and we all began to discuss.  We had time because it was moving rather slowly.  We first thought, It must be a balloon.  But, judging by the distance between our location on Beacon Hill and the Sphere's position in the smoke over the river, the balloon would have been the size of two automobiles.  Also, it's movement was extremely steady and straight.  It didn't move up or down or sideways, just straight toward the ocean.  We watched it as it passed over the Museum of Science and then it just disappeared.  I've never seen anything like it, and I would find it hard to believe that no one else noticed it, aside from the fact that not too many people watch the smoke after a fireworks display is over....everyone is looking to make their way home instead.  I would love to find out if anyone else saw this.  My friends and I are still puzzled to this day.;42.3516667302195;-71.0643806482362

It glided through the air slowly and seemed to hang in the air for a while. It moved very strangely because it seemed to travel in a very straight line.  The air around the object seemed like it was vibrating or the object had a haze around it. It flew much higher than the buildings around it but not as high as a plane passing by.  It was hard to tell if it was close to me or far away so I could not tell the size of it.  The bottom of the object was hard to see, but it looked black and flat.;42.3516667302195;-71.0643806482362
2 small consecutive black dots over Charles River;2012-11-12 15:00:00;2 minutes;2 small consecutive black dots over Charles River I work on the 42nd top floor of a luxury residence apartment building in downtown Boston.  I was on the deck outside when I saw a tiny miniscule black dot rising into the sky over the Charles River at a 30 degree angle in a direct path with no flaws in it's motion.   At first I passed it off as a balloon, after it disappeared out of my line of site behind me.  However when a second black dot followed it's direct path a minute after.  The exact same forward motion that a balloon could not make.  I tryed to film it on my camera before it disappeared, but it was too small!   I have no clue what it was!   Just a small black flying dot.;42.3516667302195;-71.0643806482362
A green planetoid looking sphere orbiting around the moon during the eclipse.;2015-09-27 22:00:00;30+ minutes;A green planetoid looking sphere orbiting around the moon during the eclipse I was taking pictures of the eclipse and, when checking my pictures, as we were sitting there, I noticed a green planetoid looking object in the picture near the moon.   I took more pictures and noticed the sphere was moving around the moon.  It was not visible to the naked eye but both my camera and a neighbor's camera picked it up in pictures.  It didn't give off any light itself, but light from the sun reflected on it so that it could be seen.;42.3516667302195;-71.0643806482362
