Green glowing disk changing to white light, streaking silently over the city of Boston, visible for less than 1 sec.;2005-02-09 20:00:00;1 second;Green glowing disk changing to white light, streaking silently over the city of Boston, visible for less than 1 sec. I had just stepped out of Shaw's Market on Commonwealth Avenue in Boston and a bright object in the sky caught my attention. I looked up and saw a small disk glowing very bright green, just the color of a traffic light. It moved quickly across the sky in a westerly or slight southwesterly direction. As it moved away from me it appeared only as a white light. It streaked across the sky very quickly, being visible for only about a second, and then disappeared from sight.  I was left rather stunned and wondering what it was. I would rule out any commercial or private aircraft. I would estimate its altitude at somewhere less than 10,000 feet. An aircrat at this altitude would move much more slowly. In fact  several minutes later I saw a plane cross the same area, and it was tiny and moving very slowly. The object I saw was also completely silent. The lights it displayed did not resemble those of a typical aircraft. I have observed military aircraft over Boston. They were extremely loud. If this was a stealth bomber why would it display the bright green light?  I would also rule out a low or high orbit satellite as I have seen them before and they look completely different.

Black Disc Floating over Charles River.;2005-08-04 19:00:00;30sec~1min;Black Disc Floating over Charles River. I am a music student attending Berklee College of Music and this UFO encounter happened on Thursday, August 4th 2005, around 5 or 6pm, there was blue skies with bits of clouds here and there.  I went out for a long walk down the east side of the Charles river starting from Mass Ave and made my way north always keeping close to the river. When I got to the first bridge after passing the Longfellow Bridge I decided to head back from the other side of the river. I crossed this bridge (passing by the Museum Of Science) and started walking back down south again sticking close to the riverside on a small pathway for runners and bikers. It was when I was around the proximity of Memorial Drive when I saw an black flying object that was shaped like a disc, floating in the distance over the Charles River. At first I thought it was a kite that someone was flying but the way it was flew wasnt convincing enough. It flipped on all three axis and it was flying only in one direction. The altitude never changed (it was flying pretty low already but could fly over 10 story buildings) and it flew way to far to be a in a kites flying range. It flew pretty slow. I stopped to watch it fly by until it flew over the buildings out of my sight over memorial drive and up north. There were people around me at that time of the event but most were runners who were out for an exercise and didnt see the flying object. I looked around to see if anyone else is pointing or looking skywards at the object but I couldnt see none. I was pretty depressed that day (hence the long walk) so I didnt bother talking to anyone around me about it. Also, at that time, I have already walked for over an hour, and it was around dinner time and I was a bit hungry. I was also listening to my i-pod all the time druing my walk. But I am pretty sure I did see a tangable object fly over Charles River that day in the fashion as I have described above. Im just not sure if I was the only one to see it or not.;42.3516667302195;-71.0643806482362

Disk with blue lights sequencing with white light emanating in spray in Boston MA 8/19/14 330 AM.;2014-08-19 03:30:00;1 hour;Disk with blue lights sequencing with white light emanating in spray in Boston MA 8/19/14 330 AM I was outside smoking holding my cat, looked up, there was a round object in the sky.  Blue lights on the bottom and the lights appeared to be rotating.  A white light emanated from the craft in a spray around the object.  It was just hovering above Copley Square in Boston MA.   It stayed there long enough for me to go outside again and take a photo, though it was too distant and too dark for my camera to catch.  All it looks like on the photo is a pulsing star but this was no star and no stars have circulating blue lights on the outside on the bottom that go in sequence.   Clearly this was some other kind of craft.  One if many I have seen this summer in Boston MA.  Though the others were spheres and multicolored.;42.3516667302195;-71.0643806482362
