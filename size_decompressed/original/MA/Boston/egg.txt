wobbly flying red object;2004-05-20 21:40:00;20 seconds;wobbly flying red object i saw a red object flying wobbly and  over newbury street in back bay of boston , ma east towards west then it stopped mid air and started going wobbly towards northeast. It disappeared into the clouds. (it is a cloudy night) it was red/pinkish.I saw it tonight on may 20th 2004 at about 9:40 pm.It lasted maybe 20 seconds. Questioning myself whether it is a balloon or not , I think it was going way too fast for that -sort of the speed of a helicopter -but it was not a helicopter (no blinking lights and it was matte round object - more like a red balloon) . also it was round and seemed more oval in the clouds. if there were any such sightings around the same time , can you please let me know? Thank you.;42.3516667302195;-71.0643806482362
Over Boston, 4 bright orange lights approach separately, hover, then recede to the South East.;2014-01-01 19:45:00;15 minutes;Over Boston, 4 bright orange lights approach separately, hover, then recede to the South East I live on the edge of Boston  Common and was walking my  dog at 7:45pm on Jan 1. I walked onto the Common from the NW corner and immediately saw a bright orange light in the sky. At  first, through the trees, I thought it might be a planet and marked its position so I could check on it again when I got to open space. When I did, it had moved and was closer. Being near Logan Airport, I first thought plan or helicopter but there were no blinking lights and it receded to the South South East. At this time I was out on open ground and the first light was out of sight, I saw another single orange light approach from the SW (from my perspective, approaching from the left side of the Hancock tower). It approached at speed, hovered for a minute or two, and then receded to the SSE. At this point there were other people walking through the Common and also looking up, seeing the bright orange light and remarking at it. After the second light was out of sight a third fo! llowed the exact same trajectory in, hovered and receded to the SSE. I decided to go inside, proceeded to tell my wife about the lights and looked out the window to see if there was another out there and there was. I grabbed my binoculars and what I thought I could see was the bright orange light and 2/3rds of whitish eggish shape to the bottom.  This light, like the others, receded to the SSE. I periodically checked out the window the remainder of the evening and saw no other lights.  A couple of other notes: While I was out on the Common, I saw 2 large jetliners take off from Logan and come relatively close to these lights. One of those two times, I thought it was dangerously close,  but it allowed to give a guess at the altitude of the lights, which I would say was between 1,000-2,000 feet.  Also, while I could clearly hear the sound that the jets taking off we're making, and a helicopter to the North, these lights made no sound that I could hear. While I am aware of Chinese Lanterns, these lights each approached at what I would call aircraft speeds, hovered and receded at 90 degree angle from origin at a similar speed.;42.3516667302195;-71.0643806482362

It remained completely stationary.  I even made a simple stationary jig to confirm that it was indeed not moving beyond perhaps rotating.  Small white egg shaped object appeared to be rotating due to to the fact that it appeared to occasionally throw off bright reflections.  First assumed it to be a planet but then it just disappeared about 15 minutes after I noticed it. Visually scanned the sky for the next hour without regaining visual contact.  If the object could be assumed to be about 100 feet in diameter I would guess it was about 12,000-18,000ft msl and 1 to 3 miles offshore.;42.3516667302195;-71.0643806482362
