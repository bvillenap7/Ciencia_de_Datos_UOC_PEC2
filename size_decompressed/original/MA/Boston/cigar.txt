3 totally black and silent cigar shapes flying at a low height through edge of city center;2006-03-24 21:30:00;30 seconds;3 totally black and silent cigar shapes flying at a low height through edge of city center Traveling home in a taxi at 21.30 on Friday 24th March. Driving through city center. Looked to my left away from city as something caught my eye. Saw 3 totally black cigar shaped objects flying in a perfectly straight line, almost in formation, 1 behind the other at slightly different heights. They had no lights at all and were sillouetted against a bridge in the distance. They seemed to be even lower than a helicopter would fly. I drew a picture of these 3 cigar shapes when I got home and only have reported this now as I read about identical descriptions. I saw them for maybe 20 seconds before they passed. They weren't flying that fast but seemed to be silent. No noise like an aiircraft.;42.3516667302195;-71.0643806482362
Two cigar shaped craft spotted lowering object into the boston side of the charles river.;2009-01-23 22:00:00;30 minutes;Two cigar shaped craft spotted lowering object into the boston side of the charles river. I saw 2 large cigar shaped craft quickly enter an area over the Charles River basin. The first craft appeared to be glowing red and I would imagine, very hot. At 23:00 I could not get to bed, so I got up to hangout in the living room. Then all of the sudden, I heard an eerie droning sound. Scared, I got up to look out the window. There were 2 craft that seemed to be lowering a kind of large tray in to the river. This lasted for 30 minutes, and then the craft silently sped off to the west. After that period of 30 minutes, I started to feel nauseous and had a headache. I threw up and then went to bed.;42.3516667302195;-71.0643806482362
Large metallic-object, oblong shaped--disappeared completely from cloudless sky.;2012-05-28 13:00:00;1 minute;Large metallic-object, oblong shaped--disappeared completely from cloudless sky. Driving east on the Massachusetts Turnpike near Newton, Mass.  Saw what appeared to be a jet plane but appeared to be no exhaust or jet lines tailing it, was just moving through the sky reflecting the sun brightly.  Pointed it out to people in the car, they recognized there to be no exhaust or typical trail.  Seconds later, it completely disappeared from the sky.   Clear sky, broad daylight, no clouds--completely gone from the sky.  It's direction of travel would have put it directly in front of our sight.;42.3516667302195;-71.0643806482362
