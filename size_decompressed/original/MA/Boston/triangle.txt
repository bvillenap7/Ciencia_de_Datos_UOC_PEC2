3 Red trianles;1994-06-11 21:00:00;30 sec;3 Red trianles May or June 11th of 1994, I am not sure any more of the exact date. I am an experianced airline pilot and I know what I saw was like nothing I've ever seen in the sky before or since. I'm not exactly sure what I saw which is why it has taken me this long to relate this story to anyone. It was approximately 2100 hrs of that evening. I had just finished flying a trip into Boston's Logan airport. The weather was warm and there was a broken cloud deck above Logan with bases of about 10,000ft and the tops ranged from 10,300 to 10,500. We had just come from Quebec so I knew pretty well where the clouds were hanging. I was walking from the airplane to our operations area in one of the large hangers on Logan's North ramp.  I looked up through a pretty good hole in the clouds as I was walking and noticed 3 objects in the sky just above the cloud tops.  The first two were in a tight echelon formation and the last one was trailing about 1/2 mile behind.  Whatever they were, they were trianglular  in form with rounded corners.  Their coloration looked black except for that they glowed  red much like a caste iron poker would glow once heated.  They approached from the west and were heading east a a high rate of speed.  Their size was emmence as from where I was standing they appeared to be a good 1 long. They were in snd out of the cloud t adjusting for my prespective that  would have them hughe.  I called a close friend at the approach control to see if they had picked up anything.  They had not. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We have requested that the witness attempt to determine the exact date of the sighting, using, perhaps, his flight logs.  PD)) ((BEGIN FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION WITH WITNESS)) Dear Capt. ((deleted)),  Thank you very much for the excellent, and fascinating report!!   I do not know what it was you witnessed, but I agree that the objects were anomalous.  I know of nothing in our military arsenal that looks like what you saw that night.  Is there any way you might be able to reconstruct the precise date of the event, using your flight logs, for example?  If possible, given the quality of the report, we would very much like to pin down all the detail we can.  You might be interested in another report from the New England area from an airline pilot.  His sighting of a charcoal-black, egg-shaped object, seen as he passed over the Rhode Island shoreline at 8,000 feet, was very unusual, too.  The report is on our website for June 22, 2000, but I copy the text below, as well:  ((RESPONSE)) Thanks for the reply...and not laughing.  It was very difficult for someone in my profession to tell that story.  I did take a look back through my logs but to no avail.  I think at the time, in my own mind I was trying to minimize what I had seen.    At the time I was also in the habbit of keeping a journal which may shed more light on the story, but for the moment that remains misplaced.  I will be happy to follow up with any more details should they come to light. Capt. ((deleted)) ((END RESPONSE));42.3516667302195;-71.0643806482362
TR3B Absolutely Certain!;1997-06-01 16:00:00;15 minutes;TR3B Absolutely Certain! I saw the TR3B in the sky in Massachusetts in 1997.  It hovered for 15 minutes, then accelerated from 0 to like MACH 10 in a fraction of a second.  It is real!  A US Navy recon space ship that defied the laws of inertia right in front of me!   I was driving on the highway and saw the triangular shaped craft in the sky.  I pulled over into the breakdown lane and stared at it.  I could see 3 bright lights at each corner of the craft.  It twisted clockwise and counterclockwise like it was floating and was light as a feather.   After 15 mins, it took off at an incredible speed.  I was 100% confused by this when it happened and for years didn't tell anyone for fear of being ridiculed.   And now 20 years later thanks to YouTube.  I now know I'm not crazy!!!!!!!!!!!! ((NUFORC Note:  Many people seem to believe in the existence of a craft called the TR3B, but no photos have been forthcoming, as far as we know, over the course of the past several decades.  If such a craft exists, we have to wonder why it would be being flown over Boston, MA.  PD));42.3516667302195;-71.0643806482362

Orange lights in the sky;2010-10-09 21:45:00;1:00;Orange lights in the sky Two orange colored lights in sky appeared suddenly... side by side, no sound , no commercial flashing tail or wing lights seen  moving east to west  south of Boston. I believed to see what was a triangle shape, but what was odd was the fact that the ‘whatever it was’ was near invisible. I saw the two orange lights clearly, but could also make out what appeared to be a triangle shape of ‘diffused light’ as if I was looking through water. The lights themselves were somewhat diffused as well, round and large, and never changing position relative to each other.  I thought to myself, ‘what was that?’ as I was standing in an area south of Boston and near Logan airport… after a moment of contemplation I thought ‘not a plane’ still looking up suddenly another object of similar shape, with two diffused orange lights, side by side, this one much smaller and following the same path as the larger ‘craft?’ Again, as if I was watching a flying triangle made of water, diffusing the light, but when looking directly at it, one could absolutely see it moving across the sky. Both were moving much faster than what I’d describe as normal speeds for an aircraft -plane or helicopter.;42.3516667302195;-71.0643806482362
Dark triangular craft glided over Boston on 11-05-11 at 5 AM;2011-11-05 05:00:00;3 minutes;Dark triangular craft glided over Boston on 11-05-11 at 5 AM Viewed from a patio on 65 chelsea st. in charlestown,  facing south.   At dawn I witnessed an unlit and silent triangular craft glide toward the financial district in downtown boston.  My best guess as to it's size is 60-80 feet across.  I estimate its speed at 150 miles per hour.  It glided without wing tip down from the northeast and over the city then took a southward curve.;42.3516667302195;-71.0643806482362
23AUG2012, 2030Hrs., Boston City Hall Plaza, Triangular Craft...;2012-08-23 20:30:00;3-4 minutes;23AUG2012, 2030Hrs., Boston City Hall Plaza, Triangular Craft... I am a US Navy veteran, and was with a friend of mine, who is a US Army veteran, on the evening of 23AUG2012 at approx. 2030Hrs, when we both noticed a unique light array approaching us from the north.  We were both sitting on the open plaza at Boston City Hall Plaza this night.  This light array resembled nothing we had ever seen before, as we are closely familiar with military, commercial, and private aircraft, as well as blimps, dirigibles, hot air balloons, and ultralight craft. As this light array got closer, we noticed that there were NO red & green (port & starboard) lights, NO wing lights, nor were there any type of landing (approach) lights seen anywhere on this craft.  Also very noticeable was the fact that there was absolutely NO sound whatsoever associated with this craft. Less than 5-10 minutes before we noticed this light array, there was an airplane on its approach to Boston's Logan Airport, and this light array did NOT resemble any other known craft. I estimate the approximate speed of this craft to be between 25-35MPH, which gave me sufficient time to get a detailed look at it, and later to sketch out the details that I saw. Sketch to follow in a separate mailing, as I have no current access to a scanner to electronically email it out to NUFORC. As this light array passed directly overhead, we both noticed that it was definitely triangular in shape, the outer body being a very black color, with an inner structure a light black or dark gray color. There were 3 white lights on each corner (rimmed in a gold/yellowish color), with a very large bright white light in the direct center of this craft, also rimmed in the same gold/yellowish color, and at the stern of this craft were 2 red lights, near the rear points of this triangle shape, equidistant apart from one another. This craft did NOT cast any shadow or reflected light to the ground, had NO sound even as it passed overhead, and continued directly south until it disappeared behind some tall buildings. Less than 5 minutes later, a twin-engine airplane passed overhead, going from east to west, and this craft we witnessed was nothing like the plane we saw moments later. Being military veterans, we both discussed what exactly we witnessed that evening, ruling out all known aircraft very familiar to us, and have no answers to this unique UAP/UFO sighting. But we know exactly what we DID see that night, and this triangular craft is something not of our current military, as we do not have this type of current technology at this time.;42.3516667302195;-71.0643806482362
Triangular Craft Over Boston City Hall Plaza, August 23, 2012, at Approx. 2030hrs…;2012-08-23 20:30:00;Approx. 4 minutes;Triangular Craft Over Boston City Hall Plaza, August 23, 2012, At Approx. 2030hrs... I am a US Army veteran, familiar with most military, private, and commercial aircraft.   On August 23, 2012, at approx. 2030hrs, a friend, who is a US Navy veteran, and myself observed an odd araingement coming in from the north, which passed over Boston City Hall Plaza at a slow, steady speed and in a straight line, and which continued south to disappear over some buildings.  The craft was triangular in shape, clearly in its shape, and made absolutely no sound whatsoever.  Its body lights were clearly visible as it passed over going to the south.   Please refer to my friend's sketch, as I cannot draw, but his sketch is an accurate drawing of the craft we witnessed.;42.3516667302195;-71.0643806482362
