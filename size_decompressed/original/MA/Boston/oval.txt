I apologize for the lack of info regarding the exact date, but I was 10 years of age at the time and not aware of your work or where (other than the local police), I could possibly report such an incident. It was about 10pm, and I was on the third floor of a two-family house, owned by my grandparents since the mid to late 1960's. The part of the house I was in was inhabited by my aunt L (my mother's sister) and her son, my cousin, F. He was three years of age, almost four, and I was babysitting. My mother lived directly below, which pertinent to this story, and I will relate to it later. We were both in the bedroom which has one window facing Northeast (in approximation to the way I was sitting). We were on the bed, watching television, and the window was open. From the corner of my eye, I noticed a light that suddenly flashed on, or appeared out of nowhere and seemed to be moving. I turned toward the window and that is when I noticed an oval object sitting directly above the moon. The moon was full and exceptionally bright (perhaps the fact that the moon was full will make it easier to deduce what day it was..., and this object sat above it and did not move. It just sat there.However, everytime I looked away this object would move and go from one end of the window to the next and then stop once again, to rest above the moon. If I hold my hand out in front of me, at arms length, I can assess that the moon was the size of my fist and the object was the size of the pad of my thumb! It was HUGE and it was LUMINOUS. I told my cousin to take a look, to confirm that I was indeed seeing this object and he reacted with genuine fear to which I too became increasingly frightened. I grew up on sci-fi, was an outcast amongst my peers and was even nicknamed E.T., so I was fully aware of the UFO and EXTRATERRESTRIAL phenomena, seeing as at that time I believed I was an abductee, and I think this is the reason why I was so frightened. THe object stayed there for over an hour to which I called my mother and told her. I was frightened and asked her to locate my aunt and to tell her to return home because I did not want to be there anymore. Now, when I asked my mother to check for the object, she did originally deduce that I was just looking at a satellite, however she did agree that there was indeed something there and that it was far too big to be sitting above the moon that way. When my Aunt did return, some two and a half hours after the object first appeared, I had already had the shades down so as not to agitate my young cousin any more. However, when I opened the shades to show her...it was gone! I have since seen satellites in the sky, and I am an amateur astronomer, and I can honestly deduce from my current knowledge of the night sky, that what I saw that day was intelligent, perhaps even mocking me, but it was not a satellite nor was it Venus...it was something else entirely. Thanks for listening!   ((initials deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));42.3516667302195;-71.0643806482362

Smooth moving orb with four rotating lights !;2009-11-10 09:15:00;2 Minutes;Smooth moving orb with four rotating lights ! We were driving to the train station at 915 when we saw an orb like bright light moving in our direction aprox. 200-300 feet above the ground. We both were amazed and I stuck my head out of the window to get a better look.  It was almost directly above us and it was no longer a bright white light but an oval shaped craft with a square compartment on the bottom that was spinning clockwise.  There were 4 colored lights on the bottom (2 red and 2 blue) after looking at it for about 2 minutes it vanished.  My eyes couldnt stop watering for about an hour.

Large white illuminated oval shape above city of Boston.;2012-08-25 00:00:00;10 minutes;Large white illuminated oval shape above city of Boston Traveling up the expressway into Boston, my girlfriend and I noticed a large oval object in the sky. It appeared to be somewhat transparent and illuminated white lights.  After seeing the object we tried to figure out what it was.  I thought it might be a blimp.  We pulled over to investigate further. It appeared to hover very slowly across the horizon.  Upon inspecting this object it couldn't have been a blimp. It was almost as if it were in a haze of white light, it did not appear to be solid or opaque like a blimp would be.  It eventually ended up hovering just above the high rise buildings in Boston as though it were further beyond the actual city towards the North Shore.  There is an airport around that area as well.  We tried to drive into the city to see it better but once in town the buildings obstructed our view. We observed it for about ten minutes.;42.3516667302195;-71.0643806482362
