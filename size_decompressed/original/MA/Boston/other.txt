Large Gulf Breeze type object seen over Boston at about 10,000 feet in Winter;1990-02-15 15:30:00;5 seconds;Large Gulf Breeze type object seen over Boston at about 10,000 feet in Winter I was a passenger with a window seat(F) on the Boston MA to Newark NJ shuttle.  We were climbing out of Boston through large thick clouds that had open spaces between them.  We were at about 10,000 to 15,000 feet when we flew by a gap between clouds and I saw clearly a large object that struck me at first as being the shape of a hot air balloon (with no gondola), but it appeared to be solid and the diameter of the bottom narrower part was bigger and had a kind of flange shape at the bottom.  The object was mostly light colored with regularly spaced raised geometric shapes in several bands around the object.  (Seven years later when I first saw the Gulf Breeze photos, I blurted out That's what I saw!) The gap in the clouds closed in about five seconds.  I looked up and down the interior of my plane to see if any other passengers had been looking out the window and showed signs of having seen the object, but no one appeared to have been looking.  I clearly remembered that it had been just below freezing on the ground as I entered the airport, so at 10,000 feet it would have been extremely cold.  The object appeared to be motionless, relative to the clouds, and it was BIG. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  One of two serious-minded sounding reports from same witness.  Please see other report for February 15, 1967, in Andover, Massachusetts.  PD));42.3516667302195;-71.0643806482362
Black Helicopter.;2005-02-14 16:15:00;5 minutes;I was a passenger in a SUV traveling down Columbus Ave in Roxbury/Jamaica Plain, MA when I noticed a very bright light coming up from due south. The subway and the Amtrak share a stretch of rail through this part of Boston that heads to NYC and I often see helicopters flying along this path and figured it was just a TV traffic copter or some other helicopter flying towards us. I noticed it was particularly low (maybe the height of a ten story building) and I couldn't hear it like I typically do when a helicopter passes over. As it flew past us on our left (driver's side) we could see that the copter had no discernible markings on it and was a dull, slate grey/black color and had a enclosed rotor in the tail - very modern looking. It slowed to a hover and looked as though it was looking for something or someone (if I had to guess on the way it was traveling - most of the other's just zoom along towards Logan or the hospitals). Even very near to us it was quiet. The whole thing struck me as odd and figured I would report it since black helicopters seem to be common around a UFO incident. About five minutes later another copter passed along a similar flight path and was much higher up and garnered no additional attention. ((NUFORC Note:  It is unusual for a helicopter to be as quiet as what the witness describes.  However, there are some helicopters, used for military or intelligence purposes, which have hush kits installed, which make them much quieter than a typical helicopter.

fast moving odd shaped craft;2006-09-27 18:58:00;10 seconds;fast moving odd shaped craft Saw only briefly and only saw the back of it, not sure of the entire shape. Craft was moving very fast, when it first caught my eye, I thought it was 3 fighter jets in formation, because of the speed. On closer look, it definately was one large craft and very unlike fighter jets.  It was silent, almost appearing to be gliding, but gliding very, very fast.  much faster then a jet, and flying very low.  Only saw the back - had distict dark 3 cylindar shapes. Two cylindar shapes appeared parallel,with distinct round ends and one smaller cylindar shape below.   View obstructed by buildings and trees, but it was moving so fast it would have been out of sight range quickly anyway. Just wondered if anyone else saw something odd.;42.3516667302195;-71.0643806482362
Four light, red center, yellow light emitted as it moved in orb manner.;2013-04-12 03:00:00;1 hour;Four light, red center, yellow light emitted as it moved in orb manner. I went outside after I learned a friend was killed on his way home after work on his motorcycle.  I went outside to pray and get some air.  It was about 3 AM EST, USA. I was looking at the sky and there was this object. It was between two stars.  We are in the city and don't see many stars here so it was clearly something different. It appeared to be four stars grouped together but it moving very fast.  I went in the house and got my husband and camera with video on it and went back outside with him.  I started filming it, zooming in you could then see it was like two Z shapes attached at the center.  It was moving in an orb manner emitting a yellow light- as if a centrifuge force.  It was huge! It was moving very fast. I know aircraft and it was not an aircraft of Earth origin. I have a video of it I uploaded to youtube if your interested contact me for the link.;42.3516667302195;-71.0643806482362
Distant unmoving object with no lights during the day on July 4th.;2013-07-04 20:30:00;:30;Distant unmoving object with no lights during the day on July 4th. While waiting for the sun to go down sitting in a kayak on the Charles River, my fiance' and I happened to look above us before the sky darkened for the fireworks and saw an unidentifiable object.  Mind you, I was completely sober and there were no waves to rock us back and forth.   The object caught our eyes especially because it didn't move, grow or decrease in size, or blink with light.  It just stayed in place.   For those on the river or downtown waiting for dusk to deepen, they may all tell you that the sky itself was odd that night, with a streak of light peach colored atmosphere across its entirety.  It's described this way because it was unclear whether it was clouds or some trick the sun was playing on us.   Anyway, we remember the craft being greyish to light blue, in a somewhat triangular shape with ridges on its side.   Just as we observed more of its features it seemed to quickly evaporate away into nothingness. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.
