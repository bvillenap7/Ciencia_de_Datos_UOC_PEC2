The harbor reflected the light of the city's buildings and visibility was very clear. We were close to, but past, Logan airport.  I happened to look up in the sky and was really surprised to see a large object I would estimate at approximately 60-80 feet in circumference with a band of large square light panels undulating around its perimeter. Their circulation was in a wave like motion. I watched it as I also scanned the water for any impediments in it. I tried to figure out what the object was. I determined it was unlikely to be advertising as there was no message. The colors in the squares were yellow, red, blue, green.  I wondered whether it was something being held aloft by a helicopter as the object was not fast moving (about 20 miles per hour)but their was no noise associated with the object. I commented to my guests, Look at that, I will bet that is in the paper tomorrow. They looked at the object without comment because they could not figure out what it was. I had recently soloed as a pilot. I had attended the 82nd Airborne Division Intelligence course. I spent 13 consecutive nights in combat watching the night sky in Korea. I had never seen anything the like of what I saw those many years later. I was well trained to report exactly what I had seen nothing more, nothing less. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The object was absolutely solid as I observed it, but appeared to fly thru the windows.;1991-09-01 19:00:00;20 to 30 secnds;The object was absolutely solid as I observed it, but appeared to fly thru the windows. Returning from Boston to PGH ON USAIR, sitting in the aisle seat, second row from the bulkhead, I observed an object fly through the right window of the first row. The round object (mostly red, some white color), about the size of a large marble, and spinning, stopped in mid air about a foot from the bulkhead about 7 feet high in about the middle of the plane.  I watched this object spin for about 10(?) seconds and not believing what I was seeing, I leaned forward and to the right to convince myself it was not a reflection.  I could clearly see that the object was 3 dimentional and could see the bulkhead behind it. It continued spin- ning for about 5(?) more seconds and flew out (through) the window on the left side of the plane. side of the plane. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Small Orb over Boston Airport.;2001-06-22 18:30:00;2 minutes;Small Orb over Boston Airport. I was setting in the airport waiting for my flight watching out over the tarmack.  I saw something floating like a baloon.  I watched it rise roughly up about 100 ft then it smothly travel towards the terminal and over the building out of site.  It was dark grey in color. It was about 2 foot across and had a small square glass area.  I could see lines arund the object.  It looked like something off of star wars.  It did not move very fast.  I would think that there were more witnesses.  There were several hours of delayed planes still on the ground at this time.  I am not sure of the exact time.  It was sometime between 15:00 and dark.  This was off of one of the Delta Terminals.;42.3516667302195;-71.0643806482362
White circular UFO outside Boston disappears--then reappears atop neon orange vertical-ellipse-shaped cloud & witnessed to Hartford CT.;2013-11-28 15:45:00;90 minutes;White circular UFO outside Boston disappears--then reappears atop neon orange vertical-ellipse-shaped cloud & witnessed to Hartford CT. Immediately after emerging from the Boston tunnels, headed Westbound on I-90, I saw a constant stationary illumination, circular and white, directly ahead of us.  Too large and too early in the day to be a star, I pointed it out to my husband, who was driving.  We joked about it, but I kept watching.  Heading due-west, I realized it was moving North and South, but there was no smoke trail.  As soon as I opened my mouth to mention it to my husband, he exclaimed, “It’s moving!”  Very soon after, it seemed to stop moving North-South, but the light got smaller and smaller until it disappeared from sight. Minutes later, we were passing over a body of water by a Framingham exit.  The reflection looked orange, so I looked up, expecting to see sunset starting.  Instead, the sky was bright blue and clear of clouds, except for one, which was directly ahead of us.  It was neon orange in color, a vertical ellipse in shape, about 40 azimuth from the horizon, about 10 azimuth in height.  I joked in less technical terms that it looked like female genitalia. I do a lot of sky gazing, I’ve never seen a cloud like this, my jaw was in my chest, eyes trained on it.  I remarked that it looked like it was glowing brighter, and the constantly white UFO reappeared at the very top of the elliptical cloud, growing from pinpoint in size to the same size as we had originally seen it.  The cloud dissipated within seconds, from the top down, looking more purple as it dissipated.  There was a bright white flash at the very top of the UFO, and a few seconds later it seemed to momentarily change from white to a faint green, but I don’t remember if this was before or after the cloud dissipated. It was difficult to gauge if the UFO was moving or hovering after that, due to the winding roads. It fell out of sight a few times when we dropped in altitude, (particularly Westbound on I/84). The diameter of the illumination was consistent until we neared the Hartford, Connecticut area, when it seemed to grow larger, and appeared to be hovering South of Hartford. We lost sight of it when we exited in New Britain, Connecticut, and we couldn’t see it at our final destination.;42.3516667302195;-71.0643806482362
