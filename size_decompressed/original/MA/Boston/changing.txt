bright light changing shape and moving quickly away;2010-11-10 02:30:00;5-10 minutes;bright light changing shape and moving quickly away I'm a bartender and had just got off of work,and was driving home.  Suddenly,i noticed a bright light in the distance.I knew it wasn't a plane.I pulled over to the side of the road and continued to observe.  This object,as it got closer to me,changed shape from a round or cylindrical object,to a somewhat rectangle.It then bolted at an incredible speed,away from me and out of sight.;42.3516667302195;-71.0643806482362
