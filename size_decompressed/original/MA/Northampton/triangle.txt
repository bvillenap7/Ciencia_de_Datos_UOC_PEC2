Low hovering lit craft.;2013-04-03 12:30:00;3 minute;Low hovering lit craft. I noticed a object with red and green lights huvering over a tall tree line, I heard a drone noise from it.    It stayed in location for a few seconds then moved south and disappeared.   It did have a white stream from glowing in from the front of the craft.;42.3245;-72.6288434782608
Triangular-shaped ufo following Connecticut River up stream.;2018-03-31 18:40:00;3 minutes;Triangle ufo following ct river up stream Noticed an object near local small airport, figured it was a plane, but realized there were no wings.  Saw red light and said to my 11yr old here comes a helicopter.  So we watched as it was coming closer, until it slightly turned and the Sun brightly reflected off its side and nearly made it invisible.   Realizing no sound, thought it was a balloon, but it was a perfect triangle.  Staying at about 600' above ground, it traveled North filling the CT river, winding as the river does.  Seemed to be mapping the river.;42.3245;-72.6288434782608
