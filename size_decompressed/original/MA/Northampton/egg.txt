I witness the UFO while driving north on I91 between Northampton and Amherst on a crystal clear day with a few clouds. I noticed it to left in the distance above the tree line. It was all white with no distinguishing marks or details, and it had a slight oval shape. The longer dimension of it went side-to-side and it was tilted left-side-down, about 20 degrees, and moving in that direction. It looked to be descending slightly. I would have thought that it was nothing more than a wisp of cloud except that it was moving extremely fast. I can not make a fair estimate, but its speed was orders of magnitude faster than a prop-plane. I witnessed a plane flying much closer to me (I was passing a small airport at the time) and the speed of that plane seemed almost nill compared to the UFO. I would estimate that I first noticed it at a distance of several miles and it traveled several miles in the time I witnessed it. The highway I was on was bending right while the craft was moving left. The tree line was rising and I quickly lost sight of the craft. What I saw was unlike any UFO report I have ever heard. I saw what seemed to be a pure white, opaque, slightly elliptical, non-luminous thing moving at a very high rate of speed, with no apparent effect on the atmosphere.;42.3245;-72.6288434782608
