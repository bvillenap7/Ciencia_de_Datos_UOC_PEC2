Glowing, flashing, spinning orb, spotted moving around in night sky;2021-01-07 20:30:00;5 minutes;Glowing, flashing, spinning orb, spotted moving around in night sky I emailed this report to your organization's director on Jan. 7 soon after the sighting.  This is a video of a possible UFO I spotted from near the dike off Pomeroy Terrace in Northampton, MA, USA at around 8:30 p.m. on Jan. 7, 2021:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKFMNoTvKe0  It appeared in the southeast sky. I shot this video with an iPhone and zoomed in further with editing software. The first 50 seconds or so is the zoomed-in version. After that, it's the regular shot. I have no idea what the object is. I'm not a UFO expert so I'm not making any claims as to what it may be. But I am very curious to find out more from reputable sources.  I reported it to the National UFO Reporting Center and the Massachusetts National Guard just for good measure.  I did not immediately hear back from either organization.;42.3245;-72.6288434782608
