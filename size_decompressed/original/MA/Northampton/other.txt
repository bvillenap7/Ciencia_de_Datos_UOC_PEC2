Not very dramatic-but observed an object that appeared to be a satellite moving in a north to south direction. Object had a redish color and suddenly exhibited an increase in speed and changed direction very erratically, disappeared momentarily and reappeared changed direction and suddenly  increased speed again. Then the object was gone. Totally duration was approx. ten seconds but as an amateur astonomer I've never witnessed flying patterns of aircraft or satellites like this before.;42.3245;-72.6288434782608

Approximately 10 PM, two white lights in formation seen moving very quickly across sky in direct northerly direction. On August 10, 2010, at approximately 10:00 PM, I went into my backyard to look up at the stars in hopes of seeing some shooting stars.  I wasn’t disappointed, and in the course of about 20 minutes or so I saw 5 or 6.  I have often witnessed satellites smoothly moving across the night skies, looking like the stars, but just moving quietly, quickly and smoothly.  Tonight, though, I witnessed two very distinct but small white lights moving across the sky from south to north, straight across the sky, more quickly than I’ve seen anything, other than the shooting stars, but nearly at that speed.  They moved in a completely straight line, in a directly northerly direction.  They were next to each other, but in a formation where one was slightly in front of the other.   That’s it.   Nothing other than that, but definitely not aircraft, satellites, meteorites or space junk.;42.3245;-72.6288434782608
