Yellow glowing oval seen by hundreds of spectators after a fireworks display in Northampton, MA;2013-06-22 22:00:00;5 minutes;Yellow glowing oval seen by hundreds of spectators after a fireworks display in Northampton, MA It was the night of the fireworks celebration at Look Park in Northampton, MA.  The fireworks had just ended and my three children, mother and I were walking back to our car along with the hundreds of other spectators. I happened to look up and I saw a glowing yellow light in the sky at about helicopter height.  It was hovering above and to the northeast of us, moving slightly west. It made no sound.  The light was oval shape and a bright yellow like a the color of a traffic light.  It mostly held its shape, but every so often a flicker would come out of it at random intervals and at random places close to the main body, like a flame. It appeared to be roughly the size of a helicopter, but taller. When I looked I could see a cone made of the same yellow light coming out from the top, shaped like a bullhorn, the narrow part attached to the main body and the opening toward us.  The cone, though it shone as if it were made out of light, ended in a sharp line and was about 1/3 the length of the body of the main craft.  This cone swept the area as if in surveillance once, twice, then disappeared, so that only the main oval was visible.  The object then moved slightly faster, continuing to the west, maintaining the same height. I watched the light until it was quite far west, but then continued walking back to the car.  Many spectators in the area saw it too and commented on how extremely unusual it was, and no one could place what it could possibly be.;42.3245;-72.6288434782608
