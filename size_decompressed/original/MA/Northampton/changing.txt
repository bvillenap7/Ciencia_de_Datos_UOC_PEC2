My daughter and I were facing West.  A VERY very bright ball light started moving up and west into the sky at a much faster speed than an aircraft, with absolutely no sound.  When it reached 3/4 of the way up, it rotated 45 degrees or so, and we could see what looked like an underside.  There were 3-4 bright blue lights in semi-circles at the top and bottom long sides, and greenish 1/4 circles at the front and back (assuming that was the front and back)  then it stayed in that position and took off to the North-East going only slightly faster than it's ascencion, and kind of circled up/down and went completely out of my visual range.   I can't say that is was round or oblong or what, but the way it looked was a kind of oblong star shape, if that makes any sense.  And the night is completely clear with little or no moon at this time.;42.3245;-72.6288434782608
