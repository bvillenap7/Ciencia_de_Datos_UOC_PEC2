I was driving east on Rt. 2 just at the Rt.2/190 split in Leominster when I noticed three egg shaped lights fairly close together but hovering independently in the sky ahead of me.  They seemed to be a medium brightness flame color.  They appeared to be pretty high but very close, as it took over a minute for me to drive directly beneath them, which is about a mile or two.  I did not notice any shape outside of the flame colored lights with the star lit sky as the background as I was passing beneath them.  Unfortunately, since I was in my car I did not hear anything.  A minute or two later I pulled over at an eye doctors office in that area but did not see the lights again.  I waited for 15 minutes and witnessed a few planes fly overhead, none of which resembled what I had seen earlier.  I also dialed 911 to report the sighting and was transferred to state police, who stated that I was the only caller regarding the issue.  Itâ€™s hard to believe since there is! a nearby shopping center with a perfect view of the sky above the highway.;42.5301;-71.7552999999999
