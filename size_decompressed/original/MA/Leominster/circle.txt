Large orange reddish circle floating still above homes.;2021-06-03 11:30:00;5 to 6 seconds;Large orange reddish circle floating still above homes. I was outside in my driveway speaking with my spouse, I was facing the opposite direction as him and as I was stretching left to right I saw to my right a 8ft orange reddish circle floating at a stand still above two homes directly behind our home. It’s color was very similar to the sun setting but did not reflect or illuminate anything around it. How bright it was I would think I would have had to squint but it didn’t bother my eyes-It made absolutely no sound. It also almost had what looked like a deeper color red ring in the center of it. It also had a slight I would say haze around the full circle.  I looked back at my spouse to point to him so he would look and it was gone.;42.5301;-71.7552999999999
