White dot slowly moving east to west in the sky over S. Leominster MA   8/29/11 @ 4:45am.;2011-08-29 04:45:00;2 minutes;White dot slowly moving east to west in the sky over S. Leominster MA   8/29/11 @ 4:45am Approx 4:45am on 8/29/11 over the south side of Leominster MA, I observed a small white light what I would say was like a dot to the naked eye traveling in a straight line slowly from east to west then changing course, visualize a square root symbol &#8730 in the sky.  Hours before was Hurricane Irene and by this time the night sky was crystal clear.  I wondered if it was maybe a just satellite but Iâ€™ve never been able to confirm that theory and I have not seen anything like it since.  Any idea?;42.5301;-71.7552999999999
Bright yellow light, size as an average star moving E to SW.  Evntually ascended out of sight.;2014-10-08 21:00:00;2 minutes;Bright yellow light, size as an average star moving E to SW.  Evntually ascended out of sight. Bright yellow light, size as an average star, or little larger moving E to SW, at one point, directly overhead.   At first I thought it was high altitude aircraft, noticed no sound and solid yellow/white light (no flashing lights).   Continued traveling W but seemed to head more SW.  Expecting it continue to travel across the sky but it appeared to ascend into the sky and disappear.;42.5301;-71.7552999999999
