They went over the highway ( I really cant say how high they were but again at first glance I thought it was a plane coming in for a landing)  I then lost sight of these 2 orange fire looking round balls...  freaky, they were not airplane, or lights they were not helicopters, maybe ultra lights? but this was 6:15 at night and it was dark?  I wasn't the only one seeing this because you could see cars brake lights due to they were all of a sudden stopping on the highway ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
