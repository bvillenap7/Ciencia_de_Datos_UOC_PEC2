Bright green flash of 2 parallel lines, lasted a second or less.;2005-11-16 23:45:00;1 second;Bright green flash of 2 parallel lines, lasted a second or less. I was driving east on Route 2 near Leominster, Massachusetts, when there was a flash in the sky - there were 2 parallel lines, further apart than an airplane's wings, and much longer than an airplane.   The lines were green and very bright.  They flashed for a second or less, then disappeared completely.  I saw nothing else in the sky afterwards.   I believe that the car in front of me saw this as well it went off the road a bit just after it happened.;42.5301;-71.7552999999999
