Opened my eyes with a pair of Oakley Prizm (red lens) sunglasses on.  Immediately saw what looked to be a missile headed West from my location.  Except the object was a bright white light with a bright white tail behind it.  In the tail it was almost a perfect stream that disappeared as the object traveled.  The tail had bright blue light outside the white and then orange outside the blue obviously ommiting fire.   The object appeared out of the clear night sky and disappeared with 2 bright perfect circular rings around it that almost immediately disappeared when the object disappeared.  No sound at all.   The tail was perfect to a very fine tip at the end of it.  The object itself had a measurement of a Chevy Silverado floodlight roughly 25 to 30 meters away.  It was huge and apparent that it was close to earth.;42.5301;-71.7552999999999
