Very large metallic craft hovered then darted away at very high speed towards the sun.  ((anonymous report));2016-11-11 07:20:00;5 minutes;Very large metallic craft hovered then darted away at very high speed towards the sun, where it played hide and seek and then was gone. While driving on Route 2 east, a very large metallic, silver craft was hovering above the highway, reflecting the sun's rays.  Thought it was a plane, but it suddenly moved very quickly away unlike any plane/helicopter I have ever seen.  It seemed to be playing hide and seek and stayed near to the sun, making it difficult to see.  And suddenly disappeared.
