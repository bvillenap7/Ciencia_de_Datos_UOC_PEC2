I was driving home from work at about 6:40 p.m. on rt 97 in Georgetown, MA when I saw something flying not too far above the trees from east to west. It didn't appear to be extremely large, and was clearly not very high above the trees (perhaps only 500 feet above the ground or less), so it caught my attention. It also wasn't moving quickly--- in fact, it wasn't moving at a steady rate of speed either. It was moving like a car might move when people are in a parking lot looking for a space to park, steadily moving but at different rates depending on the view. It was nearly perfectly triangular, at least as far as I could tell. The tips of the triangle's corners were edged in white constantly shining v-shaped lights, and at the exact center was a red, unblinking light. I thought at that speed it traveled that it must be a helicopter. I hit the brakes and would have stopped except for the traffic. Whatever it was, it slowly crossed over above the trees by th! e elementary school, where it appeared to hover briefly. I opened the window to try and hear the typical whoosh-thump of a helicopter, but instead heard only a whining hum similar to the sound of a slowing jet turbine or a large centrifuge. I looked forward for the split second to drive safely on the street, and the next moment I glanced back at it was gone, except for a brief wink of red light on the distant horizon. I had only seen it for perhaps a minute total of driving time.;42.7252;-70.9784
