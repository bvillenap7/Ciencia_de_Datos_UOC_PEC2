It was very high in the sky,but,this thing was just slowly moving, when it looked like it turned on a bright head-light,for a couple of second,then turned it off,and made a very sharp u-turn,and headeded back south!  There is NO WAY a plane could have turned like this thing did!  I did not hear anything on the news,but would be intrerewted to know if anyone else saw this!   Thank you, ((name deleted))  ((NUFORC Note:  Witness identifies self as retired from the U. S. military.  He also called NUFORC.  We suspect that he is an exceptionally good witness.

Unknown Strobe Lights Changing Directions in Sky;2009-06-24 22:10:00;1 minute;Unknown Strobe Lights Changing Directions in Sky Was outside of house,star-gazzing,when I saw what,I thought,was a BRIGHT light,like a strobe light,from a plane,heading,from where I thought was Pease,AFB,in New Hamphire,but,thes lights,would strobe,intermittedly,not like a plane! They were in one spot and the next time,would not be in a strait line,they would BOUNCEall over the sky! The Strobes,were like Flashes(VERY BRIGHT),and were all over the place! This sighting ,SURELY,was not a PLANEthe speed,and direction of flight was amazing. I called 911 to report it,and I doubt,very much,that no one else saw it. I sure would like to know!After,I called 911, I went back outside,and after,about 10 second,this,or there lights popped up again,headind back NORTHEAST until I coul not see them anymore. Ps: This is my secound sighting in about 6 Months!;42.7252;-70.9784
Fast moving green light in sky over I-95 near Exit 53B.;2019-01-15 00:30:00;5 seconds;Fast moving green light in sky over I-95. I was 1 mile south of exit 53B on I-95 south.  I saw a green light about 100 feet high, to my left, out at least a few hundred yards, traveling south also.  It was moving at least twice as fast as me and I was going 75mph.  I saw it for a total of about 5 second and it disappeared once it was a about 200 feet past me.  It flew straight, not up or down at all and I couldn't hear it at all.  I couldn't see any shapes.  Possibly a meteor I assume but I honestly have no idea.;42.7252;-70.9784
