Intense white light replaced by dot high in the night sky over Cape Cod;2007-08-12 20:30:00;1 minute;Intense white light replaced by dot high in the night sky over Cape Cod At approximately 8:30 pm on 8/12/2007, while looking at the stars with my family, an extremely bright light appeared high in the clear night sky.  The light was bright white, very intense, and 5-6 times larger than Venus.  The bright light lasted 1-2 seconds and then was replaced by a very small faint dot that moved rapidly on a southeasterly course until it disappeared from sight about 45 seconds later.;41.7321;-70.4387
