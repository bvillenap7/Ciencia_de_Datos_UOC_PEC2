4 Hovering Bright Lights In Cape Cod Sky Over Sandwich;2012-05-20 00:00:00;45 second;4 Hovering Bright Lights In Cape Cod Sky Over Sandwich At 12:00AM 05/20/12 we witnessed 4 bright yellow lights in a square pattern over Camelopardus, which was NW direction.  We stood up after noticing the lights and walked 30 feet and pulled out a cell phone and took a picture.  The top right light fell into the square and the top left light started to irradicaly shake.  All of the lights drifted left and disappeared. Sat and watched for the next hour and nothing else showed. MMR is 3 miles to the west.  There was also a satelite in the same skyward direction.  No explanation for what we saw other than 4 hovering bright lights.;41.7321;-70.4387
