A silent moving object with very bright yellow-white lights.;2010-08-29 22:00:00;1 minute;A silent moving object with very bright yellow-white lights. The object consisted of three very bright, yellow-white , oval lights.  It was shaped in a triangle. It moved with absolute silence over a portion of the back of my property.  When it moved behind a large pine tree, I temporarily lost sight of it.  When it didn't emerge, I moved and saw that it was now a pinpoint of light and was gone. I am a woman with two adult children, retired from being a teacher's aide for 7 months.;42.5516;-71.9067
