We looked up to see a light in the sky, about the size that a plane looks in the sky at night.  It had no blinking lights and moved too slowly to be a plane.  We watched it for a minute and then it flashed and was gone.  It we heard no noise from the craft through the whole sighting.  We kind of got freaked out and ran inside the house.
