I have thought that I have seen UFO's before but never as clearly as this sighting.  I was driving north on highway I95 near the Waltham exit and directly in front of me up to my right in the sky I saw a blue spherical object streak across the sky at about a 45 degree angle and disappeared before it reached the horizon without any sort of debris breakup.   At first I thought it was a shooting star or a meteor, but it was larger than any meteor or shooting star that I have ever witnessed, about half the size of a full moon.  It had a very long brilliant blue streak behind it, and its proximity to the earth's surface appeared to be much closer than any type of shooting star or meteor that I've ever witnessed.  The object was visible for about 3-5 seconds before it disappeared.;42.3795956043956;-71.2320686813187
