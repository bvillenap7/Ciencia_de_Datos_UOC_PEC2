Massive silent and fast, July 1999 in Waltham Ma.;1999-07-01 21:30:00;20 minutes;Massive silent and fast, July 1999 in Waltham Ma. in early july 1999, i had a profound ufo sighting. i was approx, 14 at the time, and a group of about 10 of my firends and i were cutting through the calvary st. cemetary in waltham (walking north from high st. on the newton line to friend st.). it was a very clear night, and out of nowhere an extremely large, triangular aircraft flew overhead from west to east.  the airpcraft was absolutely silent, and had lights throughout the bottom.  it is hard to gauge size because of the lack of distance cues in the sky, but it was obviously massive.  If it was 200 feet off of the ground, it must have been a quarter mile wide, as it took up most of the sky, and if it was higher it was even bigger. As far as speed goes, it went from one horizon to the other in approx. 2 seconds, which is staggering considering it was a clear night, and the craft made absolutely no sound.  Again, if it was higher, it was even faster.   A minute later, an identical craft flew the same route, which means there ware two identical crafts or the first craft made a circle. Everyone in my group saw the exact same things. About 15 minutes later we noticed spotlights in the sky, and military aircraft circling the skies. This continued for a few hours and then stopped. we reported the incident to the state police who told us we were not the first to call regarding the incident. They gave us no explaination, and there was nothing reported in the local papers in the following days.   Please post this on your site if you get a chance, as my hope is i can get in contact with others who have seen similar crafts, or others that witnessed what i did in 1999.  Thank You.

Triangular non moving craft making no noise with red and white flashing lights and a beam of light pointing down at police;2012-01-30 20:55:00;30 seconds;triangular non moving craft making no noise with red and white flashing lights and a beam of light pointing down at police I was driving on 95 south near exit 26 in waltham on the slow lane.  Construction crews lined both sides of the highway (north and south).  I saw a rectangular craft flashing red and white lights at about the height of a street lamp stretched across 3 left lanes of the high-way.  I was able to see the craft for about 30 seconds - the craft did not move and only looked dark in between the flashing lights with a couple of dome-shaped windows.  The craft did not move, sway, or hover and made absolutely no noise - it had a beam of narrow light directed at a frenzy of state troopers.  Half an hour later on my way up the opposite side of the high way going back the way I came, construction crews were gone, but state troopers were still there looking confused.;42.3795956043956;-71.2320686813187
