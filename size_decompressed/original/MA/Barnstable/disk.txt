A portion of the oval/disk shaped craft was exposed from the edge of the clouds. There was a red/pink colored band faintly seen around the object. This object was massive, maybe 30-50 times that of a normal passenger jet. I have a minute long video where lights can be seen making quick flashes at the bottom and around the edge of the object. It disappeared as it looked like it formed a natural cloud around itself and went back into the cloud coverage. This was below/ within cloud altitude. Bject made no fast or sudden movements. Seemed to just hover;41.704;-70.3034
