Possible UFO or military drone over residential neighborhood;2014-10-20 20:00:00;1 hour;Possible UFO or military drone over residential neighborhood My wife and I were out walking our dog, we live near Otis Air Force base. In our neighborhood we walk a loop around 4 separate blocks and then we head back inside. It takes roughly twenty minutes depending on our pace.   The whole duration of our walk there was a  craft hovering over the block.  It had some blinking lights so we thought it was a plane but it was hovering, and planes aren't supposed to do that.   It was completely silent and motionless, until we reached our driveway and then it flew away at a tremendous speed, still silent.  This wasn't the first time we have witnessed something like this, but this was the lowest, and it was definitely stationary.   For all of our walks, I'll bring my phone from now on to try and catch some footage.;41.704;-70.3034
