I believe in UFO's and stuff but have never seen anything out of the ordinary. Tonight around 8:30 I saw this shape moving across the sky on a highway.  The light in front was blinking red, three others solid white in a diamond shape.  Thought it was just a plane but thought it was weird to be so low.  When i drove farther and saw the object on my left I was freaked out because I did not see a different orientation, rather the same shape of lights.  There was no noise.  Seemed to be only a few hundred yards max above the tree level.  By the time I would have thought of taking a picture it was gone. Weirdest thing.  There is an air force base in the town over so it was probably just an aircraft but still thought I'd report.
