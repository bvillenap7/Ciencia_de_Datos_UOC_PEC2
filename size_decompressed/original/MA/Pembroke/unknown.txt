Stationary pulsating white, red & green/blue light in the western horizon;2000-03-18 22:00:00;1/2  hour;Stationary pulsating white, red & green/blue light in the western horizon Noticed a bright pusating white light in the western horizon,about 30-40 degrees up/9:30-10:00 postion. I thought it was a plane, but it wasn't moving. It just stayed there. Looked at it thru binnoculars and saw the different lights, pulsating white, red, geen/blue. Also saw faint red flashes interminent at different distances, still in close proximity, but didn't see them when not looking thru binnoculars. I know the stars can twinkle and play games with your head but this didn't seem to be a star/planet/nebula as the binnoculars are not that powerful(10X50). I live under a flight path for incoming traffic to Boston/Logan Airport and like to watch the different planes come and go but this was not anything like I have seen before. I focused on the object with the binnoculars and when I looked at the stars I had to refocus to see them clearly and vise versa. The weather was crystal clear/full moon. I really do not think this was a plane. I've watched them for many years, I know when a plane at high altitude is coming straight towards you it seems not to be moving for a long time but this was definatly different.

Also, the object is in that part of the sky where both Jupiter and Saturn are located at the time indicated, although they do not twinkle the way some stars do.  We will contact the witness again to see if the object is still visible on a later date.));42.0581;-70.8077
