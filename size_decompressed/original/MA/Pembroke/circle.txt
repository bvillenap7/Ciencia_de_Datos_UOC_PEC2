Aircraft with 10-15 yellow orange lights on it all evenly spaced apart went across the sky.;2014-02-17 22:50:00;90 seconds;Aircraft with 10-15 yellow orange lights on it all evenly spaced apart went across the sky. On the tree line in the backyard there was a glowing yellow orange dot about the size of planet venus, when it appeared in the sky.   At first I thought it was planet Venus, but the object seemed to be slowly getting bigger.  I stepped away for a minute and then looked back about 5-10 seconds later and the object was a bit higher in the sky.   It was 10-15 lights all the same size in a circular shape.  The lights were circular, yellow orange in color, and all spaced about equally throughout the circular shape.  The object was a bit bigger than the average plane I see in the sky and closer to the size of a blimp.   During this sighting my headphones were on a very low volume and I did not hear any sound coming from the aircraft which I can usually hear if I see a helicopter or plane.   Other awake members in the household, although they did not see the object in the sky, did not say to hear anything at this time.   The object moved across the sky at about the speed of a plane and was going in a diagonal line.  I watched the aircraft until I was out of window space.;42.0581;-70.8077
I noticed a very very bright round object pass us to the left traveling from the East heading West.;2019-03-28 06:15:00;<1 second;Sun was just starting to come up, sky was clear and we (my daughter and I) could see the moon very bright to our left as we were driving.   I noticed a very very bright round object pass us to the left traveling from the East heading West.  I have never seen anything fly so fast, and it seemed to just drop beyond the horizon, almost as if it landed somewhere idk.  We thought maybe it was a missile or something, but it didn't have a tail.  Strange, to say the least, and scary.   I'm 48 yrs old and have never ever seen anything like it in my life.;42.0581;-70.8077
Green, Orange and White Lights Low to Ground in Pembroke, MA USA;2020-12-22 08:00:00;60;Green, Orange and White Lights Low to Ground in Pembroke, MA USA Clear night. Lots of stars. Looking for Star of Bethlehem. Suddenly saw 3-4 objects, very low to the ground, with white, green and orange lights. They were bigger than drones but smaller than helicopters. They were following each other in a straight line. Every time I looked outside over the course of an hour I saw them.;42.0581;-70.8077
