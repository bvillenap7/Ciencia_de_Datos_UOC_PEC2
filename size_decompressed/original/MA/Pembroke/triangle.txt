3 large slow quiet planes flying low over Pembroke to Boston;2014-04-09 00:15:00;50 minutes;3 large slow quiet planes flying low over Pembroke to Boston 3 honest & credible witnesses saw 3 low flying (approximately 1000ft.) Aircraft 15mins after midnite for about 50 mins.  They flew at approximately 100mph and defined logic how they stayed airborne.  Being so large and slow.   When we first observed as we were stargazing at Mars (since it was the one night Mars was closest & brightest its been) we noticed a large Coast Guard Search Plane sized plane fly from north to south.   15 mins later a bright spotlight appeared and came from the west to the east. Then banked in a large slow sweep and headed north.  Directly up the coast from Duxbury towards Boston. I had a clear view over the pond at end of my street.   We clearly heard passenger plane type engines as they passed by.  They were 10 times quiter than any jet or plane ive.   And i live within 20 miles of 4 airports. I've heard many planes jets & helicopters in my 34 years at the same address.   All 3 witnessses have 20/20 vision and excellent hearing.  We beleive they are manmade aircraft.   However, 2 appeared to be large rectangle shape planes, with short, broad wings.  The last to go over our heads directly was spearhead shaped and flat on bottom like a Stealth Bomber.  Simular sized to a Stealth bomber.  Very strange. Lots of bright strobing red, yellow and bright white lights on all 3.
