It was light outside and I looked out our bay window and almost at eye level, I noticed what at first I thought was a plane.  It was moving very slow I picked up a camera but did not know how to use it.  I watched the aircraft move in at straight line and make a sharp turn in a direction away from me.  If it was a plane I would have saw it bank right.  I am in the USAF and to this day I beleive I saw something other than a normal aircrat ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.
