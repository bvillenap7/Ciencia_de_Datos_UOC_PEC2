It left a steam Trail that was not consistent with that of the usual aircraft that fly over this area. It went straight up an art slightly to the north but continued moving up. The trail then ceased and the object continued launching up in the atmosphere it appeared to be white possibly circular and the sun was reflecting off of it from the West. It continued to move up until it disappeared in the upper atmosphere. I am not aware of any facilities in this area that would launch missiles, Rockets, or satellite.  The trail lingered for 10 to 15 minutes after object ascended out of sight. Upon A Brief research of are craft exhaust trails and trajectory, I determined that it was definitely not an airplane but what I witnessed seems to be consistent with rocket launches in missile launches.  Again there is nothing near me that I am aware of that would be launching anything into the Outer atmosphere. there was no sound and the object was ascending at a great speed.;42.5763;-71.9883
