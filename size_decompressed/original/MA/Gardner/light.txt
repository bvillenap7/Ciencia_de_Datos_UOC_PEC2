Daylight Star?;2013-05-06 16:50:00;20 minutes;Daylight Star? I was looking at a plane that was passing and above the vapor trail was what appeared to be a star in daylight.  I pointed it out to my BF who could not see it. It was so faint that if you took your eyes off it, it wa hard to relocate it.  Finally he saw it as well.   We watched as it moved across the sky, much higher than any plane could fly.   We got the binoculars and watched it move.  Was obviously some sort of flying object.  He stated it looked like a balloon but clearly was not. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));42.5763;-71.9883
3 red lights in sky flying northeast direction flying same flight path one behind the other.;2016-10-07 21:45:00;5 minutes;3 red lights in sky flying northeast direction flying same flight path one behind the other. Friday night, driving west on route 2 near the Gardner mass exits, I saw 3 red lights in the sky flying in a northeast direction probably about the same hight of a single engine sesna.  was 3 red lights in the sky flying in the same direction one behind the other at the same altitude   The lights were not blinking like u would see on a plane or jet.  There was no other aircraft in the area at that time.  It was unnatural.   This happened between 9:30-10:00 pm. Planes and jets dont fly in the same flight pattern as these lights were doing.   Sorry could not get a picture or video of the lights do to driving on the highway.;42.5763;-71.9883
