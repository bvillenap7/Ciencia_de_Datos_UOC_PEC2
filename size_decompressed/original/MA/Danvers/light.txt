This is a usually route for planes so I paid it no mind at first. But then I noticed it was traveling very fast and flew over me quickly. It was a very bright round light yet small. It traveled faster than any aircraft I have ever seen. As a licensed drone pilot, I could tell it wasn't that. No sound, high speed, very bright. I actually waited to see maybe another, but this was the only one. I went into my apartment and then heard what could only be described as a military jet or two pass by quickly in the same direction. I have always been a skeptic, but now I will pay more attention.;42.5639000000001;-70.9462999999999
