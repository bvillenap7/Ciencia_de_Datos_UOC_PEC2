Never excellerated. 05/22/05 @ 10:00 pm.  I saw one craft moving North West from area of Logan Airport.  Moved very slowly, right over my home.  I was out with my dog. No sound. I could not make out a shape. I did see white lights on bottom of craft (as I looked up at the bottom of it) that flashed on and off in a circular motion.  Craft just flew along, not fast at all.  I am a very stable person. I beleive what I saw was not military or commercial. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) I submitted a form today. I made a mistake on the date of sighting. Actual date was 5/20/05 @ 10:00 pm in Danvers, Ma. My name is ((name deleted)). email address I put on form is ((e-address deleted)). Can you put the correct date on my form? I hope so. I would like to know if anyone else saw this object that evening. Thanks. ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM));42.5639000000001;-70.9462999999999
Orb-like craft moving right to left at night.;2012-03-15 21:20:00;30 seconds;Orb-like craft moving right to left at night We were sitting, drinking coffee, talking and looking out the sunroof as usual. We both spot and orb moving right to left above us, very high in the sky.  Was not pulsating, just an orb-like dot moving along.  We were amazed to say the least.  As the object was almost out of sight, a meteor-like object displayed above us and disappeared quick like a comet or a meteor shower.  But it was only one.  About 1 min after that I saw a bright light flash in the cloud above us and 3 f-16 planes appeared parallel to each other moving in the direction of the orb.  Also this is probably unrelated by I should mention that right after that I witnessed 10-12 albino bats flying around within 20-30 feet from us.  About 2 hours after that, we were still there as another business partner showed up.  Around 11pm or sometime between 11-12, we all witnessed a second orb identical to the previous one.  It was flying at the same rate of speed but a different direction.  Sightings like these ! don't change my life, weird things happen around me all the time but I thought it would be cool to post as their were 5 strange things in one evening.;42.5639000000001;-70.9462999999999
