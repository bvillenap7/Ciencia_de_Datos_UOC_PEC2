Two oblong objects (whitish/orange hue) travelling straight then stopped, did some figure eight swirls around each other and disappered;2012-09-20 00:30:00;1 minute;Two oblong objects (whitish/orange hue) travelling straight then stopped, did some figure eight swirls around each other and disappered On 9/20/2012 (Thursday), at approximately between 12:20 am to 12:40 am, I was standing in the parking lot of a local bank at Endicott Plaza in Danvers, Massachusetts looking at the stars.  I then observed the following:  what I thought were two shooting stars…they were two distinct objects that appeared to be almost cloudy, wispy but oblong…they had no outstanding color but were appearing to be whitish or even having an orange hue…..the objects were travelling from a Western to Eastern direction and were parallel at one point…however, all of a sudden they both stopped mid-flight and did some sort of figure-eight swirls around each other, stopped, and then went Southward very rapidly and ultimately disappeared.  I didn’t think shooting stars did that… ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));42.5639000000001;-70.9462999999999
Shiny, silver, oval oject hovering 500 feet above ground.;2013-05-05 16:00:00;30 seconds;Shiny, silver, oval oject hovering 500 feet above ground. My daughter and I were traveling on route 128 northbound going home from the mall when we both noticed a shiny, silver, oval object hovering in the sky.   I am guessing that it was about 500 feet off the ground. I asked my daughter to keep her eyes on it until I could pull over.  About 30 seconds later she told me that it disappeared when she blinked.;42.5639000000001;-70.9462999999999
Bright glowing object loses color and flies off;2018-05-29 22:15:00;40 seconds;bright glowing object loses color and flies off I was walking my dog and noticed a fairly bright reddish-orange glowing object in the southern sky near the moon and it was moving in a straight line from south to north.  I would guess maybe 2000-3000 feet in elevation, and moving at medium cruising speed.  What was strange is the object went from glowing reddish-orange to a more orange color, and then the color completely disappeared.  You could still see the object which had a light gray body color continue north until it was out of sight.  There was no sound heard at all, as you would expect to hear from a jet or plane even if delayed due to the speed of sound. I called my son outside to see it, and he did, but the color had already dissipated at that time.;42.5639000000001;-70.9462999999999
