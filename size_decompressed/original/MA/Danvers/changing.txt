For 5 sec as it drifted down towards the ground as it descend the green fireball bursted outward with light busting in an aura figure like fashion, morphing into 4 saucer objects with black labels around the middle as they where glistening they spread out from each other.  Then suddenly they stopped an a flash of light was appeared where the saucers where.  Then they disappeared after the flash of light then a black helicopter randomly appeared 300ft flying over us and started flying towards the sighting of the saucers;42.5639000000001;-70.9462999999999
