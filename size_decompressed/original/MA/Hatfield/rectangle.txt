Object in the sky with diamond array of lights floating above river;2019-03-14 20:15:00;3-5 minutes;Object in the sky with diamond array of lights floating above river At about 8:15 I went out to my garage, which was was open. It was just after dusk so the sky was dark but not completely.  My garage faces east towards the Connecticut river, and as I was walking to my car I saw something in the sky in that direction.  Hovering above the river g (or close to it), was an object consisting of four lights, either in a diamond or rectangular pattern, with one light blinking in the center. I was probably only a quarter of a mile away.  It gently, and silently bobbed there for a minute or two before it lowered to a point where it was blocked from view by a neighbors house. I then went to my car and started to drive down River road towards Whately and before I got too far I came to a field so I decided to look back to where the object was.  It was still there above the river just hovering silently like before.  A silent cluster of lights.  After a few minutes I decided to walk back to my car, and before I got in I glanced back and it seemed to have disappeared again.  Definitely a first time sighting of anything remotely like it.;42.387;-72.6126
