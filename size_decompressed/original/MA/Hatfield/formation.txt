April 6 2011 Formation Sighting Over Hatfield MA;2011-04-06 03:15:00;7 seconds;April 6 2011  Formation Sighting Over Hatfield MA I am a truck driver, so I have early work start times I was not purposely looking at the sky the morning of April 6, 2011, but I was cleaning the West Coast mirror of my truck so I was looking up at the mirror.  In my peripheral vision, I saw a left to right moving light (west to east). I thought immediately it was a satellite because there was an absence of sound.  I am always curious about moving objects in the night sky so when I was finished moving the squeegee down the mirror, I focused on the object.  Much to my surprise, it wasnâ€™t one object it was 3 spheres of light moving together in a triangle pattern. I studied the objects and atmospheric conditions carefully.  I estimate they were 1500-2000 feet high, moving at about 100-200MPH.  The night sky was cloudless with winds blowing from the NW at about 15-20MPH. I estimate these spheres of light to be approximately 75-100 ft in diameter.  Let me emphasis, these objects were not points of light that you might see from a specific light source, such as the strobe lights on an airplane.  These were spheres of muted white light, 75-100 ft in diameter each. After 6 seconds, I was preparing to take a video with my iphone.  At 7 seconds, the objects vanished in a way that looked similar to the way people disappeared when in the transporter on the TV series Star Trek, not instantly, but over a period of about a second or so. Let me just mention as background information: my father was a career Air Force NCO.  I grew up on Air Force Bases and around airplanes. I have observed airplanes both civilian and military all of my life (I am now 58 years old).  I have observed satellites since I was a kid.  I know what they look like and their predictable behavior.  This observation was unlike any in my past.  The soundless, formation flying objects were unlike any airplane(s) or satellites I have ever seen.  The fact that they were flying over one of the largest food warehouses on the east coast may just be coincidence, but maybe not. I am not a Cooke but when I shared my observations with others that night, I was treated by some like I was.  I have never reported anything like this before.  This observation has shaken me because I cannot explain it and I am reporting it in hopes that somehow the information can be beneficial.;42.387;-72.6126
