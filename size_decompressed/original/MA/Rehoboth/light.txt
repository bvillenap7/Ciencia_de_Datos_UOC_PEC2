One shot past the window at a very fast speed while the other shot off into the clouds. Went to bed late at night on July 4th but was unable to sleep. Suddenly, a quick light flashed by the window. I do not think it was the neighbors car because of trees blocking any light coming from the neighbor's driveway and the flash was too quick. It was passed by in seconds.  Later, still unable to sleep, I was watching T.V. and saw a light shooting up into the clouds. I do not think this was a firework because there was no sound and it was moving up too fast. A firework also does not explain the other sighting. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));41.8515;-71.2545
