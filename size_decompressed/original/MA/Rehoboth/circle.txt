Looked exactly like a star but much brighter.  Wasn’t an a/c.  ((anonymous report)) ((NUFORC Note:  Jupiter or Saturn??  PD));2019-04-28 02:00:00;1 hour;Looked exactly like a star but much brighter.  Wasn’t a plane because it stayed in the same spot for about an hour (2am-3am)  Wasn’t a star because it eventually moved.  I looked back a little after 3am and it has moved over a bit.  I couldn’t see it actually move because it was so high up and moving very slowly (comparable to the sun setting).  It eventually moved out of my line of vision and appeared to have disappeared.  I thought it may possibly be a satellite at first but it’s been in the same spot for quite a few weeks now.  Every time I wake up between 2am-3am, it’s there, and then after 3:30am, it’s gone.  Very strange. ((NUFORC Note:  Jupiter or Saturn??  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
