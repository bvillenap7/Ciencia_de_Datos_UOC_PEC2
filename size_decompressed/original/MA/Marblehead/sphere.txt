bluish metallic liquid ORB or sphere;2004-09-10 22:00:00;less than a minute;bluish metallic liquid ORB or sphere We had just come home and it was a very clear night sky and my back yard faces a football field with lights even though the upper sky was a deep blue the lower half near the horizon seemed almost white with the wispy cloud cover anyway I said to the person I was with lets go out back and look at the stars and for some reason he was apprehensive and chose to stand just insid the door. I commented that he was chicken and said what are you afraid of and he said DO you hear that noise and I said no and just then I looked EAST towar the football field and just coming out of the southeast just 50 feet above the trees faster than an airplane was this orb with a sky blue metallic hue to it it seemed to be spinning it seemed to be the size of a volkswagon or a very large balloon but it seemed to have the consistency of mercury and it shot off toward th North north west. It was so fast.I mean it was gone within seconds I think I couldn't really time it I was so shocked. I said to ! the person did you see that!? and he said no but I hear a whirring noise, and I said how the hell could you have not seen that, now we were arguing because the noise had frightened him and the sight had frightened me. I ran over to a neighbors house to ask what the hell it could've been and of course I got the old it was probably a plane crap. The person I was with is still frightened by the incident and dosen't like to talk about it. Me on the other hand I want to know more. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.
