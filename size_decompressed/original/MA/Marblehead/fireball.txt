GREEN LIGHT DARTS ACROSS SKY THEN FALLS.;2002-03-04 22:10:00;3 seconds;GREEN LIGHT DARTS ACROSS SKY THEN FALLS. AT FIRST I THOUGHT I SAW A STAR FALLING, AS I CONTINUED TO WATCH IT TURNED GREEN THEN STREAKED ACROSS THE SKY TOWARDS THE SOUTH EAST AND DROPPED DOWN. IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A COMET OR METEORITE, I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE OF THOSE BEFORE, EXCEPT FOR HALE-BOP WHICH LASTED IN THE SKY FOR DAYS. I'VE SEEN LOTS OF SHOOTING STARS, BUT I NEVER SAW ONE TURN GREEN AND MOVE ACROSS THE SKY. THE WEATHER WAS COMPLETELY CLEAR. STARS REAL BRIGHT.;42.4947;-70.8499000000001
