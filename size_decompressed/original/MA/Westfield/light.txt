Moving in zig-zag patterns in the sky over a long period of time. Around 03:00 a bright light appeared about 5 degrees below Orion's Belt.  Blinking blue, white, and red light eminated from this object.  A plume of light came off the object at about the 8 o'clock position.  The object would irregularly alternate movment in a small zig-zag pattern, and a circular pattern.  Over an hour the object moved from north to south very slowly.  After watching the object for about 45 minutes it's brightness would fluctuate and then a second object appeard directly under the first, brighter object.  The second light was about 20 degrees closer to the horizon.  After observing the two objects for a time greater than 15 minutes their blinking and brightness fluctuated and then a third object appeared about 5 degrees lower than light # 2 and slightly further south.  The three observed lights would blink irregularly, sometimes sychronized, and sometimes independant of eachother.   The first light was by far the brightest.;42.1301166666667;-72.753974074074
