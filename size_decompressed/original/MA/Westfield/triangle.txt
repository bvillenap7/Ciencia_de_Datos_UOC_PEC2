We went outside and we watched this glowing white ball of light in the sky for about ten to fifteen minutes. it hung in the sky strobing and pulsing. I had gone back inside and told my wife she being a skeptic did not believe me so I said to her that I was going to go back to see if i could find it in the sky again. I was not dissapointed I walked to the south end of my porch and looked south and saw what I thought was the same light again. It was moving at moderate spead heading north then it banked towards the east. Then it moved from the east to the north west wich brought it almost directly above my head. I had a fantastic view of the underside of this craft. I will detail it in another post as I have to do it in my paint shop to accurately describe it. Anyhow it flew above my porch and it was triangular in shape had a central large red globe of light in its center. It had three smaller red globes from the central portion to the top axis of the triangle, And three more heading to the back axis of it. It had large white globes on each point of the triangle. It also made no noise not a hum not a whisper, it was approximately 150-200 ft in the air. Had a shimmery effect underneath of the craft as well if you look at gas fumes shimmer in the sunlight it is similar. And this is the most amazing part, I watched it cloak itself. It did not dissapear all at once but bit by triangular bit like this >>>>>>. Well here in my town we have an air reserve base and about a half hour away we have an airforce base. One thing of note no other airtraffic in the area that night. I think it was one of ours. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.
