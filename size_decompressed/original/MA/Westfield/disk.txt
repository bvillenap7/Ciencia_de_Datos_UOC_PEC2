Large bright golden glowing object hovering over Barnes airport.;2013-06-17 00:30:00;15 minutes;Large bright golden glowing object hovering over Barnes airport. Hovering bright large object.  Spotted over Barnes Airport.  Moved about 20ft up and then 20ft to the right then disappeared.  Very bright golden color glow coming if it.  Looked like it was sparkling.  Could in no way be a plane, moon ' star etc.   Not sure if this was something the airport was working with but it was nothing I see that is typically in the sky.  I have lived here for four years and have never noticed anything like it.  Half of the object was covered by trees but the part I could see looked large.   At the time I spotted this no other sky activity was going on.  I was hoping a plane would fly by so that it would see the object.  I woke my boyfriend up to see it and he also was able to get a view of it but at that time it was already moving towards the right and was mostly blocked by trees.  He too was unsure of what it could be.  Also, it was silent. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
