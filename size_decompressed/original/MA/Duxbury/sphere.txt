A night on the beach;2003-08-06 02:00:00;:45;A night on the beach One late night,Me and my ex - girlfriend were laying in the sand on Duxbury beach.All of a sudden, while looking up at the sky,I noticed a light that resembled a sphere moving in zagzag position.After a few moments of fast movement,the object disappeared into the ocean.In response,I swear that life definitely exists outside of the human race.However,it's definitely by choice to respect.For those believers,our question is this...Why do they keep coming here?People have reported spheres,triangles,lights,circles,formations,etc.This is more than enough possible proof that we are encountering frequent visits from diferent alien life forms.Therefore,let the truth be told that if everyone is telling the truth about what they've witnessed....we may be in trouble. Does anyone know anything about why we can go to war amongst each other, but can't identify an alien species which may become a threat to humanity..For real.

Pale glowing orange, low flying, spherical object;2003-12-21 01:28:00;a few seconds;Pale glowing orange, low flying, spherical object Drving home after dropping a friend off at around 1:30 in the morning we were in a small neighborhood in a wooded portion of town when I saw a small(diameter less than 1m) spherical object that was glowing a pale orange/ yellow color move across the path of the car a ways ahead and then proceed quickly up and over the trees westward away from the nearby ocean.  I immediately was silent and quickly tried to discern what kind of astronomical event had just occured.  I then turned to my two friends (one of whom is an experienced sky jumper and has done jumps at night) and asked if they saw the meteor or whatever that was. When they both broke their silence and said they had saw it as well, we all knew that it was no meteor, considering how close it was, its appearance, and its relatively slow speed.  We all had watched a meteor shower on the beach before.  None of us could come up with a legitimate explanation for the object and we were all a little freaked out. I am typing this about 14 hours later and have heard no other news of the sphere and am hoping someone will see this report and confirm it.;42.0380055555555;-70.7157805555556
Object rose completely vertically to a point and continued completely horizontally until abruptly vanishing.;2020-07-31 21:25:00;3 minutes;Object rose completely vertically to a point and continued completely horizontally until abruptly vanishing. An amber colored object rose completely vertically over northern horizon and abruptly stopped gaining altitude.  Object continued to move completely laterally while growing continually brighter.  Object then rapidly changed color to blue, dimmed and absolutely disappeared from view after continuing in this manner for a short time.  Object made absolutely no noise and no navigation lights were present despite a seemingly low altitude.;42.0380055555555;-70.7157805555556
