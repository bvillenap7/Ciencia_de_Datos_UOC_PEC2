Strange bobbing light above horizon.;2005-09-28 23:00:00;10 Minutes;Strange bobbing light above horizon. Was at the beach, enjoying the night weather, when I noticed a strange light above the horizon.  At first I thought it was a plane, but as I watched, I noticed it was just a solid orange light.  Pointed it out to my friend and he saw it as well.  It was moving in a swinging motion, sort of the way a moth flies. From left to right, it would move and bob up and down.  At several points, it would pause, move backwards, then shoot right again at an increased speed.  It continued slowly moving parallel to the horizon, until it finally stopped for a few seconds and disappeared.;42.0380055555555;-70.7157805555556
