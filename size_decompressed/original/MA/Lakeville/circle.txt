It was too early for the moon to be in that position and this light was too bright. We went to our porch and got a closer look and video.  It was a bright whitish blue circle, could have been octagon shaped.  It stayed over the tree line for almost a minute moved slightly to the right, stopped, and then moved off quickly behind the tree lines.  We live on the 3rd floor, so we ran outside to the car and tried to follow, but it was gone.;41.8363;-70.9607
