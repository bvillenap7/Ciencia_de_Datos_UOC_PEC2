Got up to go to the bathroom at 3:26 am, looked out window onto back yard, which backs up to the wetlands, saw a craft above the tree line moving slowly but steadily, it was shaped like a triangular chevron, thought to myself is that a stealth fighter?  It had a white flash light on front center tip and three flashing red lights on the left right and pointed rear of the craft, did not make a sound.  Slowly dipped down behind the treeline.
