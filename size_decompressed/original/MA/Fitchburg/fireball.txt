I called my wife to look at it,as i went outside to take a closer look because i thought it was a hot air balloon.  I noticed it was no balloon it moved closer towards me and there was no sound at all.a small plane flew rite over it, so i knew it wasn't no plane, i could here the plane clearly,so i called my neighbor out to see it.  As it passed behind the trees it started moving at a faster pace as we watched it move faster it started to lose its flame like glow then it just disappeared into thin air,  it was just about dark out so i can see a little daylight in background and there was nothing it just vanished!;42.5781;-71.805
