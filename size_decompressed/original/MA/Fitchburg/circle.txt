It was skipping about in the sky very fast, couldn't keep track of it. It had a quick pulsating action. When it reappeared in a different spot the second time, it flew behind a mass of trees. There was an extremely bright white light - in a very cloudy sky. It was skipping about in the sky very fast, couldn't keep track of it. It had a quick pulsating action. When it reappeared in a different spot the second time, it flew behind a mass of trees. I never saw anything like it... There is also a very strange occurrence in Lunenburg, the next town over. Over Lake Whalom, every evening.,there is a huge bright white light that hovers in the same position of the sky evening. It pulses very, very brightly. After about 5 minutes it slowly moves to the left and it abruptly disappears. It will reappear shortly after and do it again - all night long. The locals have been seeing this for years, and it very dependable. It is not a plane, for it is there every evening. It stays in the same place until it shifts to the left and disappears. It is not a planet - for it is there yearround and it moves. I guess you just have to see it. I am a webmaster in West Boylston, MA.

It was very low and I thought it was on fire and would hit the earth as it was moving left to right in a downward motion.  Appeared to be a fireball.  Lasted all of 3 seconds before it was completely out of sight.  It was much lower than any airplane flying overhead and moved incredibly fast.  It had no tail like a comet but it definitely appeared to be on fire.;42.5781;-71.805
Light the size of a star would turn on and off periodically then vanished.;2017-08-24 20:48:00;5 minutes;Light the size of a star would turn on and off periodically then vanished. My friend and I saw a circle very very high in the night sky come from one of the planet stars.  I believe it was circular however, it was high up and dark so unsure.  The light was a single light and got as bright as a star then would shut off.  Then after a few minutes, it would shine again.  The object would sparatcly light up and turn off.  The object also sparatcly changed the light which came from it.  It was moving slow.  Much too slow for a plane.  Then just vanished after about 5 minutes.;42.5781;-71.805
