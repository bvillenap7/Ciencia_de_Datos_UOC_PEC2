The object then rose from the the ground level to over 80-90 yards up over the tree line.  It did this in less that a second. I then woke my son and pointed the object out. While he viewed this object I ran downstairs to get my digital olympus camera and then ran out into the middle of my back yard.  The object had moved 200 yards east and at that time i manages to snap 6 pictures of an object that I cannot explain.  There was no wind, there was no sound and it moved faster than any objest that I have seen. The shape was trinagualar and seemed to spin like a top.  After exmining the pictures at 800X, we noticed a white field arounf the object that looked very interesting. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length with this witness, and found him to be quite convincing.  We are awaiting copies of the photos, and will post them if they look interesting to us.

Then what i thought was an airplaine came really fast and started to hover over our house it had these huge orange lights underneath i woke my wife up to see it. it still has me freaked out i know what a plane looks like but that was no plain it was way to thick and to rounded. i was trying to take pic. with my phone but they came out all black. i dont know it still has me buged out. ((NUFORC Note:  Probably a star, we suspect.  PD));42.5781;-71.805
