The tall one showed me a vision again.;2020-07-30 02:30:00;3:00;The tall one showed me a vision again They were tall and white, they put a hand on my forehead so i can see a vision, visions i have seen before.  There is a war that has been for thousands of year, they are gray and they smell bad, the tall one brought me close to it, their eyes were black i mean blackest material you could think of couldn't explain the color it was like i could see a galaxy in its eyes i could feel it hatred, it wanted to kill me like i was there in front of it like it could see me.  There is a device on the move that destroys plants the whites can no longer protect us from this any longer we are running out of time i could see the destruction of one of their allied planet its like something from of movie one beam of light and all i saw was a flash and this planet was just in pieces i could hear there cries but it wasn't a cry it like a sad sound like they were sad what they were showing me. They showed me this because they can feel courage in me eventually ill have to make a decision on whats right and whats easy its not the first time this has happened they call me friend for many years now sometimes just showing me they are watching, waiting for us to stop fighting and if we do they showed me a future of us humans becoming planet conquers i could see lights on the moon and spacecraft and makeshift trading points of gold and other materials, but that future is slowly fading. After the tall one let go i was in my room felt like puking and i was cold like i was sitting in a freezer for 100 years.;42.2125;-70.9960999999999
