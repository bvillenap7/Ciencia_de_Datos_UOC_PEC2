I as traveling north on RT68 0n 9/19/14 at ~5:30pm when I saw what looked a little like a fighter jet very very slowly cross over the gap in the tree cover above the road.  It was very low maybe three times the height of the trees, it's orientation was perfectly horizontal, and moving so slowly that I can't imagine the wings would have provided any lift.  I didn't actually see any wings but that may have been due to my viewing angle, I was looking straight into the side of the object, and the sun was reflecting off of it and may have obscured my sight of any wings.  But the nose was very pointy.  The size was about that of a fighter jet.   I was driving in my truck with the windows up, no radio on, and I didn't hear any noise from the object, however I'm not certain if I would have heard anything if it was a conventional aircraft as I don't have any experience with the sound level of a fighter jet.  Given that there are no military bases near by that base any type of fighter jets, the entire experience struck me as very strange.;42.3775;-71.9453

It had 3 flashing lights, one in each corner, which flashed orange and white.  The three lights were evenly spaced and far apart from each other making a perfect triangle, and they were all traveling the same exact speed.  It traveled directly overhead all within a matter of seconds.  It didnâ€™t make any sounds.;42.3775;-71.9453
