Shooting star object, much brighter that a star.;2013-11-29 20:30:00;7 seconds;Shooting star object, much brighter that a star. On Friday evening, 11/29/13, at about 2030, I was stationary in my vehicle looking South, toward Mt Hope Bay when I saw what appeared to be a shooting star.  The object was much brighter than a star, and it moved across the sky from Left to Right (or East to West).   I observed this object for about 5-7 seconds, and in the last second or so, a small piece broke off and arched backward, as if the larger object was moving at a greater speed, and when the smaller piece broke off, the 2 objects disappeared.;41.704132631579;-71.1487768421053
Large red light with approximately four green flashing lights, colors vivid and movement odd;2015-09-23 20:10:00;5 minutes;Large red light with approximately four green flashing lights, colors vivid and movement odd I am a 47 year old woman, I work as a drafter and take classes at Bristol Community College in Fall River MA.   At approximately 8:10 PM the night of Sept 23rd I saw a bright red light over the campus parking lot.  It was not moving but it was flashing 4 green lights in the front.  The colors were very vibrant, and it seemed closer that a plane would fly.  There was no sound.   I watched it for a few minutes and the green lights stopped for a few seconds then they resumed flashing and it started moving off across the parking lot towards the North east.;41.704132631579;-71.1487768421053
