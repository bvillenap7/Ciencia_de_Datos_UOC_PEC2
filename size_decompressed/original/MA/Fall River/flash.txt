I was on my way to work at the time i spotted this object in the morning sky. i heard a roar like a jet engine which made me look up at the sky, thats when i saw about 5 to 6 bright flashing lights in the night sky about 200 feet in the air. the lights where not flashing all at the same time they where like  independent flashing all most like sparklers they all had like formed a outline of the ship but i could not see it just the bright lights looked all most like tiny stars flickering the sky was clear and calm at the time so it was clearly visable.
