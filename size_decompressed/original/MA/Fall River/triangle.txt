When I looked up, I initially saw nothing, but a few seconds later a very large triangular object appeared.  The body of the object was difficult to see, however there was a bright red light at the point that illuminated the triangular shape.  It almost looked like the body was invisible, but I could see the outline of the object.  In amazement I watched it hover slowly over the area and it just disappeared.  I looked around to see where it may have gone, but it never reappeared.  The sky was clear and the moon was very bright.  It traveled in a northerly direction.  I've never observed anything like it before.;41.704132631579;-71.1487768421053
