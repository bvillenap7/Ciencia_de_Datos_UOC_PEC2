Orange lights over Massachusetts.;2011-06-18 23:30:00;10 min;orange lights over Mass Myself and friends were all fishing on the beach when we noticed at least a dozen orange balls of light appear.  They appeared to be coming off the ground in the distance which can only be speculated to be aprox 15 miles.  For the distance of the lights, they seemed large, and very clear.   As the orange lights rose in the air, the similarities looked similar to a constalation while hovering there.   After several minutes passed, they continued to rise, and separate while flying at extreme speeds in various directions.  The speed can not be estimated, but surely was faster than any aircraft ever seen in flight.   After the seperation of the orange lights took place, they weaved through the atmosphere in very uncharacteristic motions.  After witnessing this for an additional 2 min., they shot across the sky which seemed to be the spped of light and dissapeared.;41.704132631579;-71.1487768421053
