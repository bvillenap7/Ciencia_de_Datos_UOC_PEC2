mirror shaped object hovering;2007-09-21 18:00:00;30 seconds;mirror shaped object hovering I was driving to see a patient in North Dartmouth, Mass. I was traveling south west. The sun was going down and the moon was out at the same time. I was looking at the moon while I was driving and I saw a MIRROR colored circle in the sky, as I kept looking it changed it's shape so I could see that it was a UFO and then as quickly as it appeared, it disappeared.

The object was large with 5 glowing white lights, shaped like a Jacks (sort of 5 pointed).  We pulled up a bit to get a better look, turned around, and it was gone.;41.6312;-70.9957
