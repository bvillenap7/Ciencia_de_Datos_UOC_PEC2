3 ORANGE CIRCLES.;2012-11-17 16:30:00;5 minutes;3 ORANGE CIRCLES Last night around 8:30pm I was outside on the back porch.  In the Eastern sky I saw an Orange light, not a plane.  Light was not blinking, but maybe flickering a bit similar to fireball.  Light was too big to be from a plane, completely silent!  It wasn't going too fast. It was circular.  Not too far behind was a second one. I followed with my eyes to the West till I couldn't see them anymore.  Then trailing behind was the 3rd one.  I took a short video with my phone of the last one but it didn't come out too clear.  I live in Southeastern MA.;41.6312;-70.9957
