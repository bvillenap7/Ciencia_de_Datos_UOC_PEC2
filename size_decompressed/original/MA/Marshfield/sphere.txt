I tried to see if there were any others in the sky around me when two bright white and orange light are coming my way just above the rooftops.  I tried to video tape them passing over me from my phone but the phone didn't pick up the objects so I waved out the window to what seemed to be an alien drone observing and taping me and an orange light turned on in my direction as it slowly drifted away over trees.  The next night I went to get in my car after trying to make contact with the drone thing and it was in the sky staring towards me and it followed me in the sky as I drove. I was so distracted and scared of it that I was drifting over the side of the road.  They are watching us for some reason by unmanned aircraft ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));42.1034;-70.6967
2 Glowing Lights in Marshfield, MA;2019-10-08 21:00:00;5-7 minutes;2 Glowing Lights in Marshfield, MA We had just finished dinner in Brant Rock and driving back to Plymouth on the back road via Rt 14. Heading South west we noticed 2 round objects glowing high in the sky. One was closer to us, the other was much higher. At first we thought it could have been a couple of drones, then thought it could have been Chinese lanterns but they had a steady, controlled movement about them. The were glowing and were spaced well apart from each other. When we came to a stop sign, we looked around and couldn't see them anymore.;42.1034;-70.6967
Silvery object traveling westerly.;2021-06-13 17:00:00;20 seconds;Silvery object traveling westerly. Laying in grass looking at planes in the Logan flight path and noticed a shinny silver object above the planes traveling in a more westerly path than the plane north west path. Seemed like it was much higher than the plans approaching landing. Watched it until my view was blocked.;42.1034;-70.6967
