Blue/green teardrop over woburn;2003-11-26 06:12:00;5 minutes;Blue/green teardrop over woburn Around 6:12 am I got out of my car to deliver a paper (I'm a paper boy). The skyline on Old Farm Rd, is huge. You can see planes taking off from Logan airport, traffic helicopter's, everything. Now I was about a mile out from route 93 (where the helicopter's hover near boston, and about 12 miles outside of Boston itself).  At that point I noticed a blue/green object stopped behind the treeline in the far distance. I thought nothing of it really (though why I don't know cause the thing was blue/green) cause I just figured it was a plane taking off facing me.  When I came back I looked up and saw two commercial airplanes in the air to the south and strangely enough, a jet leaving a smoke trail directly overhead. Then I noticed the blue green object had started to move in a direction it couldn't possibly have moved.  It was huge, looked to be a weird top heavy shape with a round, thinner, bottome. It was flashing white and red lights. Immediately I started comparing it. It was moving incredibly fast (passing my line of vision over the horizon every 5- 10 seconds). I started to doubt it was a plane (no plane would ever fly that low) and by now was pretty freaked out because I realized I was the only one seeing this and even contemplated knocking on someone's door to get a confirmation.  This thing was viewable from where I was for about 5 minutes (the view on old farm road is massive), and then it fell out of the viewable horizon.   I thought it could have been a helicopter, but I don't think helicopter's are A) completely silent, and B) Glowing blue/green.  Interesting note the miltary jet that was high above my head seemed to be on an arching rise and when I saw it the smoke trail was descending. I think it might have been following it.;42.4809267605634;-71.1562816901409
