On Friday night my wife and I were coming home from a movie. We were on Winn St in Woburn MA when my wife pointed out a strange object that appeared to be shaped like a diamond in the sky. The Light's on each corner appeared to change color several times. My wife and I pulled over to the side of the road to oberve it further where it hovered for several minutes before streaking off into the far horizon out of our sight. From being in the military the object wss like nothing I have ever seen. I belive this information would be usefull to your site. ((NUFORC Note:  The twinkling star, Sirius, is in the northeastern sky at this time of year.  That would be the first possibility that we feel should be ruled out.
