On the 14th at approximately 0325 he witnessed the same object but there were 2 circles of light one was moving in the western sky and the other one was stopped and just sitting there in the sky. He thought they might be planes from Hanscom AFB .It is about 10 miles to the west of us here in woburn. But there was no wing span visible and the lights were steady ,not flashing like you would see on a plane.;42.4809267605634;-71.1562816901409
