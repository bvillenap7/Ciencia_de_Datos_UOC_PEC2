We, of course, thought they were parasuites and were wondering why they had opened up their parasuites so up in the sky. They started as a closed group but started to move apart from each others. They moved very slow, pretty much the same way one moves with a rectangular parasuite. We also noticed one object apart from the main group much much lower than the rest of the objects. We thought that it was one parasuiter that had opened his parasuite much later than the other ones. The objects came in many colors, yellow, green, blue, red etc. like rainbow colors. We noticed that the top ones started to move UP instead of down. We thought that because of the wind streams, they would be in trouble and end up all the way to New York from Boston. However, the objects started to move up and the just simply *disappeared* from the sky. We were althogether three people in the beginning of this phenomena and I invited my two daughters from inside to see the objects as well and they saw those too. I am pretty sure that there were A LOT of people in the area that saw the same thing because this happened at noon and the weather was just beatiful, full of sunshine and clear blue skies.;42.4809267605634;-71.1562816901409
