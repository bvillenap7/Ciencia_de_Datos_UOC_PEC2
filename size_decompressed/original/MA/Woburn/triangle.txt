At fir;2002-02-16 18:00:00;10 minutes;I was in the middle of doing pilates with my wife when we saw something through our window that looked like a trianglular shape. At first I thought it was a plane because it was dark outside and the craft was far away so it really didn't grab my attention. As the craft got closer, there was still no sound. That is what really surprised me because I don't know of any plane or helicopter that doesn't make any noise. The craft then started going backwards, and I know planes can't do that. When I saw the craft do that I knew that I just had to see it. So my wife and I went outside to see it and that is when I realized that it wasn't a plane. The craft started glowing and it was definitely a trianglular shape. When the craft stopped glowing it was gone and there was no trace of it. I'm not sure what it was. I don't think it was a UFO because I don't believe in UFO's.;42.4809267605634;-71.1562816901409
Two triangle shaped crafts one with red & green lights the other white/violet lights.;2013-08-13 01:00:00;1 hour;Two triangle shaped crafts one with red & green lights the other white/violet lights We seen two UFOs like 12 times at least and they was circling and one was slow and stopped allot and the other was fast more erratic and both Low to the ground.  Triangle shaped one had green and red lights the other flashing white/violet lights a lot of light both all around sides and bottoms of craft.   We drive around trying to follow them they would disappear and then all the sudden there they were again.  Was as if they saw us seeing them the green and red lit one would stop frequently then bolt when noticed only to come to a sudden slow down.   The white lit one was always moving and sometimes moderate speed to very fast speeds with both aircrafts having jarring movements.;42.4809267605634;-71.1562816901409
