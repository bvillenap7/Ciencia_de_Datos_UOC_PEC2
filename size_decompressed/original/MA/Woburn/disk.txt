2 black flying objects that moved quick and than disappeared;2012-10-22 18:15:00;<2 minutes;2 black flying objects that moved quick and than dissappered On Monday October 22, 2012 my friend and I were standing outside of our work around 6:15 pm. I just so happen to look up in the sky and what I thought was 2 balloons floating up into the sky, were not balloons.  I realized that they were not balloons when they started to move in my direction. My friend and I were like what the heck is that? The 2 things were moving at a good rate of speed towards us.  They started to go over our building and we started to walk backwards to see if we could still see them.  The one on the left started to fade in and out.  It went from black in color to not being able to see it.  Both of these things were flying parallel with each other the whole time, they would dip down and rise together.  As we started to walk backwards and to the side of the building to see them better they were gone.  I have a small picture of what it looks like on my phone. In the picture I only got on and itâ€™s really small but in person they were not that small!.  I need to zoom in on the phone to see it better.;42.4809267605634;-71.1562816901409
