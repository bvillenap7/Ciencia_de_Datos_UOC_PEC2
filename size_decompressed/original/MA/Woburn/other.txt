At first I thought it might be an airplane but when we drove more down the road you could see the LED light was beaming down through some haze. When I looked up the UFO was in the shape of a line and it had 3 lights coming from it in total, as we drove more down the road I noticed it also had a blinking red light.  We could not tell what color the UFO was.;42.4809267605634;-71.1562816901409

All were pretty close to each other, some momentarily disappeared and reappeared . It was daytime and very clear skies.  The lights were very visible.  After searching online that night I thought maybe Star link satellites, but they weren't scheduled to be in that area.  And would they even be visible during the day?;42.4809267605634;-71.1562816901409
