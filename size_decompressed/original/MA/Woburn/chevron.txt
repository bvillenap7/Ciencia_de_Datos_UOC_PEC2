I stepped outdoors to look at the moon with binoculars and had just gotten them focused in very sharply, when I saw the object. An object shaped like a 'V' , flew across the face of the moon heading east. The object was in sharp focus. It was black and there were no running lights. The binoculars are Nikon 7x20  7.1d  Travelite 2 model. It was small relative to the moon. It take about 20 of it's wing spans to match the moon's diameter. A few seconds after the sighting, I looked all around the sky east of the moon. I could see nothing but stars. There were a few aircraft in the area and were easily recognizable by their lighting. My first thought was that an F-117 Steath figher was flying over. I wonder if anyone else in the Boston area saw this..?.;42.4809267605634;-71.1562816901409
