It appeared like a satelite moving across the sky, stopped, did a S then streak off at 90 degrees.;2005-06-22 22:30:00;30 sec;It appeared like a satelite moving across the sky, stopped, did a S then streak off at 90 degrees. I took my dog outside as usual for the night. As I was sitting on my back deck waiting, I saw a shooting star out of the corner of my eyes. The sky was extremly clear and I could see more stars than usual. As I watched the sky, I noticed what appeared to be a satelite moving North to South. It did not dawn on me at the time that satelites do not normally move North to South. I watched it move across the sky and was following its path. When it reached 12:00, or directly over head, it stopped. I was floored. I have seen many satelites travel across the sky, so I knew this was not normal. It stayed motion less for about 5 seconds, then it move in the same direction quickly in a S pattern and stopped at approximately 11:00 O clock. Again it stayed motion less for approximately 5 seconds, then streak west to east and out of sight in approximately 1 second. I am a private pilot who has flown many nights and have seen many satelites. This event leaves me with no reasonable idea what this was. It was not a weather balloon, laser, plane, cloud, meteor, or satelite. I was awake, not tired, no stress, not intoxicated, or under the influence of any medication. It appeared first like a star, when I realized it was moving I thought it was a satelite. It did not grow in size or get brighter. It stayed constent in appearance and brightness. It defied all logic and Physics. I have read simular stories of this pattern, and have always thought that people eyes were playing tricks, or they wanted to see a UFO so bad that they saw what they wanted. I was not looking for this event. Am not a UFO buff. But this event has changed my thinking. I was totaly amazed.;42.4809267605634;-71.1562816901409

I remarked to her Wow, that's really moving, when it suddenly stopped and hovered for about 10 seconds, before proceeding to speed in the direction of Wilmington, MA, where it again stopped and hovered for a few seconds, before proceeding to return back in the direction I was standing.   My wife had gone in the house and alerted my son, who also observed the object move, stop, and hover again, before proceeding rapidly in the direction of Stoneham, MA, and out of sight.  At no time was there any sound noted.   The only thing it could have been was a drone, but the height and especially the extreme speed, makes that very unlikely in my opinion.;42.4809267605634;-71.1562816901409
