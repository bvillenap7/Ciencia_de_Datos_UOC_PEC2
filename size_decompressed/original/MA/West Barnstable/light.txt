I went out side because i heard my dog barking and bring him in for dinner, when i went out i looked of in the distance and see three lights. one solid in the middle and two lighter lights blinking at the same time. as an avid watcher of the sky i can testify that this was not an airplane.  it was moving way to slow and was silent the whole transition across the sky even after it passed there was no sound to follow unlike a jet.;41.6993;-70.3683
