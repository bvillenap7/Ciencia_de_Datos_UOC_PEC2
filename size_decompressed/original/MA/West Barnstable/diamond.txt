Thety have been around 2 days. February 19, 2012 I was outside and notice to very bright lights close by my home. Later that night around 9:00pm the lights had moved but were still present.  One light had a gold color and the others were bright lighs with flashing red lights.  I thought maybe I was not correct and possible it was a star.  The next night February, 20, 2012 I went outside and the two bright lights were close together and very close by my home.  The Other light that was a gold color was up higher in the sky. Later that night I went outside to check and the lights that were close by were no longer there, and had moved directly in front of my home but higher in the sky.  I am not sure what it is called but there is a high post by my homw with three red lights.  The object was next to this rod with the red lights, I sat outside to see if this would move.  I watch it move away from the lights and lower itself. Later that night I came out again and the light b ut the pole was gone and t! he brioght gold light had moved as well.  These lights are not stars, I am not insane and what i saw was to me I believe UFO. I will be curious if they are back tonight again.  These lights have been lingering in this area now for two days/.;41.6993;-70.3683
