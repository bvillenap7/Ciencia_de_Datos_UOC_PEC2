Reddish bright object traveling southeast from brookline towards south of Boston.;2014-12-17 23:00:00;15 seconds;Reddish bright object traveling southeast from brookline towards south of Boston. At about 11:00 pm on December 17th, I looked up in the sky  and saw a reddish bright light UFO traveling in the sky in a southeast direction from Brookline towards the south of Boston.   I took pictures of the  object  and the object appears whitish in the pictures with two other objects in the background, perhaps asteroids.   This object was traveling across the sky, not falling from the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  The witness forwarded three photos to NUFORC, and each of them shows one lone orange-colored light in the distance.  PD));42.3153;-71.1610999999999
