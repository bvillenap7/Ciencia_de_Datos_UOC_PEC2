Triangular craft over Rte 146;2011-01-21 17:15:00;10 seconds;Triangular craft over Rte 146 I was traveling on Rte 146 South at 5:15 pm on 1/21/11, when I saw a single black, triangular shaped craft with an incredibly bright light on it hovering in the sky to the left of the highway.  I stared at it, trying to figure out exactly what I was looking at when it dive bombed the earth in a semi circle movement.  I thought I had just witnessed a plane crash, but as I drove along I looked for fire and smoke - any indication of a crash - but there was nothing.  That was not a normal movement for an aircraft to make. It was gone in the blink of an eye.;42.1299;-71.7632
