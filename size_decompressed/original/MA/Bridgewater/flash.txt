Light over Bridgewater.;2013-11-28 18:30:00;5 minutes;Light over bridgewater. Appearing as a tiny double flash. Watched this thing go across the sky.  Was watching a satilite, when I saw it first... moved about as fast as a satilite, & looked just as high.  Doing a double flash evey 10 seconds or so,only saw it when it flashed white.  No other colors.  Unlike any plane ive ever seen... & it seemed to high to be one anyways.  Didn't make any sound.

Also there was alot of other smaller anomalies flying around at one point in front of car idk if its bugs but there hasn't been any bugs out at all and these move super quick and are super small white and black;41.97758125;-70.971590625
