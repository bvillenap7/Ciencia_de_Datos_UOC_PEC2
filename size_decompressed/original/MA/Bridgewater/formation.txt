Cluster of lights.  One bigger, several smaller around it.  Dimmed and brigtened.  495 s Massachusetts;2009-05-04 20:30:00;15 minutes;Cluster of lights.  One bigger, several smaller around it.  Dimmed and brigtened.  495 s Massachusetts I was with my niece and daughter after picking my daughter up from Bridgewater State College in Massachusetts.  We were on Route 495 s to 195 w and there was a cluster of lights in the sky.  They would get bright and then dim but stay lit.  One larger in the middle and several around it.  They stayed up there for our whole stretch down the highway (495) until we couldn't see the view anymore because of the trees on 195.  My daughter spotted them first and then asked us to confirm.  We all saw it very clearly.  It was amazing.  We still talk about it.  I'm not sure of the exact date, but I've often wondered who else saw that.
