My husband and I rarely talked about it to each other after the incident, which was short in duration but very baffling just the same.  We were walking casually on a street parallel to the center of town and something caught my attention up above the houses.  It was darker than the night sky and shaped like a tri-cornered hat.  It was massive in size, about the size of a soccer field  There was a bright white light on each corner.  It was traveling very slowly, almost like it was 'coasting.'  My husband and I stood and watched it drift over the rooftops, but oddly, it was silent.  The craft drifted out of our line of vision, and the trees inhibited further viewing, so we didn't see which direction it went, but it had to have traveled over the center of town as it was too large to avoid it.

OBSERVED ONE VERY LARGE TRIANGLE WITH 5 LIGHTS TRAVELING TO THE NORTH EAST, POSSIBLY IN EARTH ORBIT.;1997-11-01 03:00:00;10 minutes;OBSERVED ONE VERY LARGE TRIANGLE WITH 5 LIGHTS TRAVELING TO THE NORTH EAST, POSSIBLY IN EARTH ORBIT. BACKGROUND INFO,I AM A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER IN BRIDGEWATER MA. WORK THE MIDNIGHT SHIFT AND ENJOY STAR GAZING (FINDING AND IDENTIFYING CONSTELATIONS) WORKING THE NIGHT SHIFT FOR MANY YEARS IVE GOTTEN TO KNOW THE NIGHT SKY,BETTER THAN THE AVERAGE PERSON.I HAVE SEEN SATELIGHTS, COMETS, FALLING STARS AND EVEN SKYLAB WHEN TOLD WHEN AND WHERE TO FIND IT.AS A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER I AM TRAINED TO BE OBSERVANT AND TAKE NOTE OF ANYTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY. IN ORDER TO BETTER PROTECT THE PUBLIC. IN THE MONTH OF NOVEMBER 1997 (I FORGOT THE EXACT DATE)WHILE ON DUTY I DID OBSERVE A GROUP OF STARS THAT I DID NOT RECOGNIZE, VERY LARGE IN THE NIGHT SKY,FORMING A TRIANGLE.CONSISTING OF THREE WHITE STARS IN THE FRONT AND TWO RED STARS AT THE BASE OF THE TRIANGLE. I ASKED MY SELF WHAT CONSTELATION IS THAT, NEVER SEEN THAT BEFORE. THE NEXT THING I OBSERVED WAS THAT THIS (GROUP OF STARS) WAS MOVING. IT APPERED TO BE IN EARTH ORBIT MOVING IN A NORTH EASTERLY DIRECTION. I OBSERVED THIS IN THE SKY FOR 10 MIN. ITS SPEED WAS  CONSTANT (ON THE SLOW SIDE) AND THE TRIANGLE FORMATION NEVER VARRIED. I ALSO LOOKED THROUGH BINOCULARS,HOWEVER THIS DID NOT REVEAL ANY NEW DETAILS.THE NIGHT SKY WAS CLEAR AND I DID OBSERVE THE OBJECT UNTIL IT WENT OVER THE HORIZON. MY THOUGHTS BASED ON MY OBSERVATIONS, MY FRST OBSERVATION THAT THIS WAS A GROUP OF STARS WAS INCORECT BECAUSE THIS OBJECT WAS MOVING. THE FACT THAT WITH A EXPERIENCED EYE FOR STAR GAZING THAT I MISTOOK THIS AS A CONSTELATION REVEALS ITS SIZE. IF MY OBSERVATION THAT IT WAS FLYING IN EARTH ORBIT WAS CORRECT THAN THIS COULD HAVE BEEN A MILE WIDE,MORE OR LESS, IT WAS TRULY HUGE. ANOTHER POSIBILTY IS THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN THREE SEPERATE CRAFT FLYING IN PERFECT FORMATION IN EARTH ORBIT,ALTHOUGH IT DID NOT SEEM TO BE THIS TO ME AT THE TIME,I HAVE NO EVIDENCE TO RULE THIS CONCLUSION OUT. THE FORMATION SEEMED TO ME TO BE TO PERFECT TO SUPPORT THIS CONCLUSION. THE REASON THAT I HAVE REPORTED THIS SO LATE IS I HAVE JUST GOT ON THE INTERNET WITHIN THE PAST WEEK.SINCE I HAVE GOTTEN ON THE INTERNET I HAVE BEEN RESEARCHING U.F.O. FILES TO SEE IF ANY ONE HAS SEEN ANY THING SIMILER TO WHAT I HAVE SEEN. I DID FIND ONE WHICH HAPPENED IN RENO NEV ON 11/15/97.WHOEVER READS MY REPORT SHOULD CROSS REFERENCE IT AGAINST TIS REPORT. IF I HAD TO PLACE A DATE ON MY SIGHTING I'AM SURE THAT IT WAS IN NOVEMBER OF 1997 THE DATE WAS SOME WHERE AROUND THANKSGIVING,DEFFINETLY THE LATTER THIRD OF THE MONTH.;41.97758125;-70.971590625
