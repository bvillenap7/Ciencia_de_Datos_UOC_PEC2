3 round crafts and a hidden 4th;2020-09-26 18:39:00;10 minutes;3 round crafts and a hidden 4th At the beginning of the sighting there were 3 distinct crafts moving within each other and seemed to be switching locations with each other in the pattern of 3 that you would see on a dice. In the last 6 seconds of the video you can see them align with each other and then there is a 4th craft and they are in the formation of what you would see as a number 4 on a dice. I will send photos in a separate email and I am able to send the video if that is an available option.;41.97758125;-70.971590625
