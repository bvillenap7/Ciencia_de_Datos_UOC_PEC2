chevron object with lights north south path in Bridgewater MA almost invisible and really fast;2011-08-30 21:45:00;1-2 seconds;chevron object with lights north south path in Bridgewater MA almost invisible and really fast Object was triangular and about 3/4 of an inch when hand held straight out to the sky. This size was estimated immmediately after the object left view. First spotted at 12:00 position and took about 1.2 to 2 seconds to be obsructed by a tree at about 45 degrees from 12:00.  Travelling north to south (roughly 187 degrees-measured after sighting using the tree as a fixture).  It was triangular and had about 5 lights in a v shape flying point forward.  Was going very very fast with no noise at all.  The sky was perfectly clear with stars.  The object had a traingular shape but it was difficult to focus on any lines or even the lights, I had the impression it was shimmering.  Only had enough time to say What the **** is that?! and grab my brohter and point to it before the tree blocked the view. He saw it as well. My brother said it had a glow to its edges but was not streaking. It was not very bright at all, almost invisbible, I was just plain lucky to be loo! king at the exact spot where I noticed it. Bridgewater is south of Boston and on an approach to Logan. Very hard to tell how high this thing was but it was much higher than the trees and much larger than an airplane and going about half as fast (maybe more) as a meteor would streak. I'll never forget this or doubt others who have seen similar things. It just left me dumbfounded and not doubting I saw something that did not belong here.;41.97758125;-70.971590625
