See the pics and decide for yourself.;2012-12-01 18:00:00;2 minutes;see the pics and decide for yourself. my son and i were standing in our driveway at approx 6pm.we noticed a large ball of light traveling slowly across the sky the way a sattelite would.i snapped some pictures because it was nothing like i had ever seen.meaning the size of it and rate of travel.after taking the pictures i did not think much of it until recently when i was cleaning up the pics on my phone.when i came across the pics i blew them up with my i phone and was stunned with what i saw and also there was a second craft.i heard no noise and lost sight of them after a minute or two because of the tree tops,so i am guessing they were in our atmosphere and not space.otherwise why would my pics be so clear.;41.97758125;-70.971590625
