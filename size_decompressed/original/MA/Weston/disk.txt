daughter's abduction;1978-07-15 16:00:00;15 minutes;daughter's abduction  500 Lights On Object0: Yes I was at a friends house about 15 miles west of Boston in the Town of Weston. A saucer shaped craft came an hovered over my friends backyard where some 20 plus people were playing frisbee, volleyball, touch football and enjoying a hearty cookout. The craft came down and landed in my friend's backyard. a door opened and two tall, slender gray colored, about 6'2 and about 6'4 beings, came out and floated across the yard. The crowd panicked and backed away. My friend's mother ran out of the house screaming for everyone to get back. My friend's younger sister was frozen like a statue. These two beings floated across the yard,toward the frozen blonde haired young lady. Her mother ran right at the two beings screaming no you can't take my daughter. One of the beings raised their hand knocking the running mother over backwards, rendering her unconscious. The two beings came and took the daughter by the arms, floated back to the hovering craft, doors opened, in they went and the craft left slowly at first, then disappeared very quickly. The daughter was never returned. Since the summer of 1978, my friend's sister has never been seen again. The mother had a complete nervous breakdown, as she told of her own abductions. Officially the daughter's disappearance, has been categorized by the local police and FBI as an unsolved kidnapping. Everyone I have told this story to has never believed me. The mother told me of her own abductions as well as her daughter's abductions as a small child. The daughter had just become 18 years old about 6 weeks before she was taken.
