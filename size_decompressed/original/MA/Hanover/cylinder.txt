Silvery trashcan shaped object with strange aura observed during rush hour traffic;2001-07-11 17:45:00;7-8 seconds;Silvery trashcan shaped object with strange aura observed during rush hour traffic at 5:45 pm driving south at 55 mph in right-hane lane on Rt. 3 in MA around Hanover/Pembroke area.  A storm front to the south, clear sun to North allowed for clear visability ahead.  Noticed a slight white flash, as if something popped below the clouds ahead to my right at 2 oclock... thought it was sunflash off of a plane, but the flash didnt diminish, so it caught my interest.  My next thought was how fast it seemed to be approaching, following the line of the highway.  As it got closer I saw that there were no wings, then that it wasnt a helocopter.  I also observed a strange aura/trail around it similar to the heat that rises off a hot road. no sounds, seemed also to have a slight wobble maybe caused by the aura, as it seemed to blur the outline.  object silvery, seemed to have black on it shape seemed to resemble a trashcan (or R2D2 from star wars) Continued to approach, and passed overhead and behind me and I lost sight of it.  observed other people in the cars around me also looking into the sky as they passed me.  total time of sighting less than 7-8 seconds;42.1194;-70.8611
