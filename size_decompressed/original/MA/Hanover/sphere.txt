Between 2 to 3 minutes into the ride we see a blue flash of light from the right side of us coming from the woods i look out my window and see a blue ball just floating above the tree tops and as soon as see it a split second later it just flies towards the woods and vanish behind the large tress.;42.1194;-70.8611

Driving down main street, looked up into sky and saw a red sphere with what looked like orange fire coming out of the top of it.....stopped  my vehicle, rolled window down to listen -- no noise at all.  This object was floating silently in an easterly direction.   Other aircraft (airplanes) were also visible.  I have never seen anything like this in my life and this was no plane or helicopter.   I have no explanation.  It scared me.;42.1194;-70.8611
