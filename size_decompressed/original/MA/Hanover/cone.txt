The best way I can describe it is a sailboat with a blue flame for a sail.;2008-06-18 00:30:00;10 seconds;I was driving home after the Celtics game and saw three lights in a triangular shape slowly floating a few hundred feet in the air. it was around 12:30 am and i only saw it for a few moments because of the trees. Every few seconds there was a blue flame that burst out of the top of the black craft. The best way I can describe it is a sailboat with a blue flame for a sail. It was low and moving slowly, I've never seen anything like it ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));42.1194;-70.8611
