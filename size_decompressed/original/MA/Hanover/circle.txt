More than 30 orange lights in Massachusetts;2011-12-25 20:00:00;1/2 hour;More than 30 orange lights in Massachusetts The homeowner went outside and from the driveway observed numerous red/orange round shaped lights traveling in a deliberate west to east direction at a fast rate of speed (faster than a plane).  It was an overcast night and the objects were below the clouds. He went indoors to alert his guests.  Approximately 8 people ran outside and watched for a period of 10 minutes as groups of objects traveled from the west toward the east.   There were various groupings of 2 to 5 in organized formations as well as some random clusters.  At one point the observers counted approximately 30 objects together in the sky as they streamed by before they lost count. One observer reported that the objects traveled back around in a large circular pattern and flew over more than once. This episode lasted long enough for these neighbors to alert others and eventually the group of witnesses totaled 9 or 10. These objects were all bright lights â€“ red, orange and amber in color appearing as round balls.  There was no sound associated with them.;42.1194;-70.8611
