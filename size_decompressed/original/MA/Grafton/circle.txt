Circular silver object with bright lights hovered over our heads at tree top level before whooshing off;1974-08-01 19:00:00;10 mins.;Circular silver object with bright lights hovered over our heads at tree top level before whooshing off I was riding with my mother on Millbury St. in Grafton.  I was ten years old. It was just starting to get dark.  The street was a country-type road at the time.  We noticed an object in the sky and stopped our vehicle and actually got out of the car as did the people in the car in front of and behind ours.   We all stared up at a circular disk hovering at tree top level.  It was about the size of a station wagon.  It was silver with different colored lights around the perimeter.  It hovered there not making a sound for a few minutes while we watched standing by the sides of our cars.  It then just zoomed off at tree top level with a whooshing sound at a very fast, steady speed and disappeared quickly.   We didn't say a word to the other people watching (which seems odd in retrospect) and got in our car and attempted to follow it.   We actually spotted it again about a mile up the road as it once again zoomed off from a hovering stance.   We never forgot the experience and ! have talked about it for years.

Two friends and i saw 9-10 balls of light  forming a circle over the tree tops flying around on particular area in the distance.;2008-01-01 18:30:00;about 45 minutes from the;Two friends and i saw 9-10 balls of light  forming a circle over the tree tops flying around on particular area in the distance. A friend and I were plowing a school parking lot on Millbury Sreett in Grafton. I was going about my business when my friend came running over to my tuck. I said whats wrong and he says Tell me what that is. pointing to the sky over the treetops. I looked up and saw about 9-10 balls(The sight was so amazing i forgot to count) of light (whitish bluish mix similar to LEDS Just barely could see them though) in a perfect circle similar in size to a moon in the sky when the object was above the treetops. The balls of light were on the edge of whatever it was to form a circle so it appeared. It fluttered around like a frisby or like a leaf falling to the ground or something blowing in the wind (seemed unstable). It would dissapear into the trees then reappear above them for a few minutes at a time at treetop level. We at first thought maybe it's a toy or something but then it rose very slowly thousands of feet up into the cloud cover then came back down then dissapeared into the trees. We then were perplexed by it. We waited for it to come back up but it never did so we went back plowing. I again though on the opposite side saw it popback up and hover in the same area as did my friend. Then it slowly rose up into cloud cover then was faintly visible then dissapeared into the night. I attempted video of it on my camera phone but the light from the school blocked it out so the background just looks black. I know what a plane's lights look like I know what a satelite looks like it was not any of this. We didnt hear any propulsion system as well you could hear the rumbles of passing airliner or jets in the distance here and there but nothing sounded to be comming form the objects direction. I was just curious for an explantion if any on this object.;42.2004000000003;-71.6868000000003
Orange ball shoots across the sky.;2009-12-23 21:00:00;6 seconds;Orange ball shoots across the sky. I was standing on my back porch with my dog and looking at the stars and watching the treetops sway in the breeze.  It was a pretty clear night, there was a crescent moon to the left and stars and dark to the right.  An orange ball appeared out of nowhere above the tree tops - it was bigger than the moon, but it seemed very far away. It was really quiet.  I looked at it, trying to figure out what it was.  Then - bam! - it took off.  It looked like a big cone. It went left - horizontally - across the sky and then disappeared.   I thought maybe it was a comet or something but all the pictures of comets I see online are white/blue - not orange - and this was very orange. It also didn't dissipate, like a shooting star does. And it went horizontal, it did not move DOWN it went ACROSS. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.  PD));42.2004000000003;-71.6868000000003
