Bright white light zig-zags and dissapears;2001-09-18 19:00:00;10-20mins;Bright white light zig-zags and dissapears Me and some friends were taking a buddies jeep four wheeling in a field the day after a rainstorm.My friend got his jeep stuck in the mud so we had nowhere to go but to try to get it out and we were there for a long time.It was a very large open area.As it was getting dark we all saw this bright white light on the horizon,it was slowly moving towards us then it stopped in mid air,did a zig-zag and dissapeared into the night sky.Idont think a plane,jet,helicopter,or any of the modernday vehicles can manuvere like that and to this day we all have never forgot what we saw that night.

Two still, round objects that were very bright and were not resting on anything, so could not be a lamp post of some sort.;2011-08-13 20:00:00;5 min;Two still, round objects that were very bright and were not resting on anything, so could not be a lamp post of some sort. Driving past an old farm when I saw two bright lights that were about the size of softballs. They were about 100 feet high, and 100 feet apart.  They were not moving.  I watched for about two minutes until they just disappeared.   Never seen anything like this before. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.
