Looked like ducks flying south with lights.;2003-11-08 19:45:00;30 seconds;Looked like ducks flying south with lights. We were watching the lunar eclipse (with binoculars) when we observed a chevron -shaped formation traveling from East to West at a high rate of speed. The formation itself covered approximately 10 degrees of arc and traversed the entire sky in approximately 30 seconds. With the naked eye, the formation looked like a solid boomerang, but with binoculars it was possible to discern at least 20 to 25 separate points of light. There was absolutely no sound associated with the sighting. ((NUFORC Note:  One of several reports about the same phenomenon.  Other reports from New York City, as well, which should be submitted as written reports before we post new reports.  PD));42.2004000000003;-71.6868000000003
3 lights flying similar to a satellite, but 2 of the lights faded in and out of sight;2015-12-06 17:00:00;1 minute;3 lights flying similar to a satellite, but 2 of the lights faded in and out of sight I noticed a dim solid white light, appearing very much like a satellite, travelling west to east, speed very similar to that of a satellite or the space station.  Then in front of this light, about 1 moon distance, appeared a second solid light.  This second light, traveling slightly higher and at the same speed, was the same size and intensity but over a 5 second span it would fade into view and then fade out completely. This repeated at a uniform rate until they both disappeared near the tree line near the horizon.  In addition, a third light started fading in and out right next to the second light, at the same rate and speed.  All three were moving at the same speed and were spaced differently between each other.  I witnessed this for around 20 seconds and then called 3 others that were indoors to come out and they witnessed another 20 seconds.  None of us had seen anything like this.  It definitely was not a plane.  I would say it was a satellite or the space station but the consistent fading in and out of light 2 and 3 has me baffled.  I researched space station fly over times and it was not flying over at the time;42.2004000000003;-71.6868000000003
