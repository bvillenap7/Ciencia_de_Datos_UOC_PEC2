Appearing above the horizon, we all observed a column of orange-red-amber orbs climbing swiftly across the sky towards us.  They were spaced out and it took about 4-5 minutes before they all appeared.  They were swift, in comparison to an airplane or helicopter, but not as fast as a shooting star.  Then, each one disappeared overhead into the clouds. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));42.2004000000003;-71.6868000000003
