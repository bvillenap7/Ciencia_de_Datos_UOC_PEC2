Bright round object at low altitude that proceeded east and then vertical out of sight within 2-3 seconds of eye contact.;2006-06-25 23:43:00;less then 3 seconds;Bright round object at low altitude that proceeded east and then vertical out of sight within 2-3 seconds of eye contact. As I was walking back towards my apartment with my dog, I saw a bright blue/white object in the sky that appeared to be at a low altitude. It seemed to me as if it did not want to be seen.  I saw it out of peripheral for a second or two before i made direct eye contact.  I was facing east when I saw the object. It was a circular pulsating bright light.   With in 2-3 seconds of me making direct eye contact with it, it shot off at an extremely high rate of speed almost completely vertical to a high altitude out of sight/atmosphere.  It did look as if it curved upward by traveling east for a split second then shooting upward.  It traveled fast enough where the light that it was giving off formed a tail of its course that lasted a split second.  I am a college educated young professional who has never made any report like this in my life.  I am 100 percent sure that this was not any type of man made aircraft and honestly have never been so scared in my entire life.  Unfortunately because of the duration of the event, I have no pictures or video.  I didn't see anyone else outside but myself at the time.;42.3491000000001;-71.5431000000002
Formation of white lights;2013-08-17 21:15:00;~2 minutes;Formation of white lights I was in a car when another passenger noticed a line of lights (dots) moving perpendicular to our direction of travel.   There were five of them the first four traveling in formation - with a straggler following a close distance behind. I'd say they were white-ish in color, and they did not have any flashing lights. There was a plane nearby, but the objects didn't seem to interact with it at all.;42.3491000000001;-71.5431000000002
Strange wobbly light in the sky moves around for two hours;2016-07-29 01:00:00;2 hours;strange wobbly light in the sky moves around for two hours I was looking for the north star with friends when I spotted a star near the horizon line that appeared much brighter than any other star.  I began to suspect it was not a star at all because it was flickering/pulsating in a way I had never seen before, and appeared almost reddish.  I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me and alerted my two friends who were with me, when suddenly we all saw it begin to steadily move up in the sky, at which point we saw another, much dimmer light moving away from the big light and disappear.  The light moved quickly back and forth and went in circles in the sky for about two hours, its movements could almost be described as wobbly.  We noticed it looked almost like it was reflecting something beneath it, as though there was something bigger there that we couldn't see.  Around an hour in all of us noticed that it was getting dimmer, as though it was getting farther away, but it never disappeared.  When we left to go to sle! ep it was still out there.  Earlier that night while stargazing my friends and I had witnessed a bright flash in the sky that was not a shooting star or lightning.  I'm not sure if this is significant or not but around an hour before this took place my two friends and I had taken a walk through the woods and noticed that there were a TON of owls out.  I've never heard that many owls before in my entire life.  Not sure if this counts as Animals responding to the event or not but there you have it.  Lastly I noticed this morning that I have a small circular bruise on my wrist that was not there earlier that night.  Again, not sure if this is significant or not.  I cannot say for sure whether or not time went missing.;42.3491000000001;-71.5431000000002
Object Emits Bright Light, Turns Off, and Quickly Leaves the Sky;2020-12-18 16:45:00;1 minute;Object Emits Bright Light, Turns Off, and Quickly Leaves the Sky Behind the Wegmans grocery store, on a hill facing south and overlooking the town, I was with my girlfriend eating dinner in a parked car. The lights were off, car was running. She says she was observing the anomaly for approximately 30 seconds, noticing the unusual brightness put in the distance. Dumbfounded, she turned to be and asked me what it was.  I looked up to see a bright white light in the distance a couple miles above the horizon. Observing the object for about 10 seconds, I assumed it to be the north star... but then I realized that the North Star would be behind us due to the car facing the southern direction.  Before I could say this to my girlfriend, the light immediately shut off as if a light switch was being flipped. And about a second later, the tiny dot that could have been what was shining so bright, shot off to the southeast, and was gone.  We pondered all the possible options as to what object could be, but couldn’t not determine it’s identity.  There were radio towers in the distance but much closer to the ground, and far less bright and consistently blinking on and off. There were planes in the sky, but much father away or higher up, also far less bright. The north star was not even nearly as bright as this object but was the closest thing I could have concluded the UFO to be. However, stars don’t just stop shining like flipping off a light switch on top of this, the north star was behind me from how we were positioned.  This occurred just as towards the end of Twilight so it was perfect to identify differences between stars, planets, satellites, radio towers, or planes.  This was not any of them. This is not my first UFO encounter, but it is the most unique and clear event I have observed yet.;42.3491000000001;-71.5431000000002
