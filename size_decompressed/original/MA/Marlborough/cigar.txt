Cigar shaped silver object flying low and slow over Marlborough, MA at approximately 10 a.m. on 8/28/14.;2014-08-28 10:00:00;30 seconds;Cigar shaped silver object flying low and slow over Marlborough, MA at approximately 10 a.m. on 8/28/14. Wife and I driving up Hosmer St heading north.  Cigar shaped silver object flying low and slow from west to east.  Due to trees, it was only in sight for less than a minute.  No sound.   Possibly the angle didn't allow us to see wings.   I am 70 but I have excellent vision.  I saw it so briefly it was difficult to judge the altitude and speed ... also had to keep my eyes on the road.    My first guess was that it was a drone of some sort.   Seemed too large to be a remote.  My wife is 67 and she concurs with this report.;42.3491000000001;-71.5431000000002
