Metallic ball hovering in the sky in Massachusetts;1999-06-01 16:00:00;five minutes;Metallic ball hovering in the sky in Massachusetts It was a sunny day, clear blue sky. I was standing outside of my parent's house. Looking Northeast over the backyard and the neighbor's house, I saw something in the sky. It looked like a silver x-mas tree ornament - that's how I remember describing it. It just hung in the air for a while, moved around a little bit, made a motion left, then floated over to the right, behind some trees. I followed it but it seemed to have just disappeared. It was small but I could tell that it was not a plane or helicopter - nor was it a balloon. This was shining, like metal. It was a little darker at the bottom of the sphere. I've seen pictures online of other alleged UFOs that look just like what I saw. I'll try to upload one.;42.3491000000001;-71.5431000000002
Round orange objects floating across sky and disappearing one by one.;2014-11-05 20:00:00;8 minutes;Round orange objects floating across sky and disappearing one by one. We walked outside last night around 8pm and I noticed 4 round orange/yellow/reddish objects in the sky.  I thought they were helicopters but my boyfriend said that we would have heard them.  These objects were 100% silent and floated across the sky.  There were another 3-4 more round objects following behind and at first they appeared to be traveling in a similar formation then they became random as one by one they started to disappear until the last one was gone.  A few seconds later a commercial plane flew by over head and we could clearly hear it which told us the objects we saw were silent and moving MUCH slower than the plane.;42.3491000000001;-71.5431000000002
