June 30th 2008 around 5:00 pm eastern time. There was a big thunderstorm coming from the north that had not reached us yet. The storm was moving fast heading south. Me and my wife where on the porch looking at the clouds when we saw a silver cylinder in a vertical position moving at a steady speed, steady path, from east to west. We saw it for about 30 seconds until the view was blocked by the woods. The object looked like a thick, big, metal Pringles can. It did not make any noise and it was not afected by the strong storm winds. I am guessing it was about 1,000 feet from the ground, it did not touch the clouds. The other weird thing that happened was that when it was getting out of our view for about 5 seconds it looked like a vertical bow, like a bow tie. I tought it was my eyes playing tricks on me until my wife said “did you just see that?, it turned into a bow”. If anyone knows if there are weather ballons, or other artifacts that are like this object  please let me know. Thank you.;42.3491000000001;-71.5431000000002
