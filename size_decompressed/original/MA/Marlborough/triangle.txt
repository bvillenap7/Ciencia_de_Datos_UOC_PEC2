3 red silent lights.;2016-12-28 17:00:00;2 minutes;3 red silent lights I was driving to my sons doctors appt with my boyfriend.  Where we live there is a lot of planes so we were watching them up in the sky.  My boyfriend spotted three red dots hovering over a field in the night sky.  There was no noise from these red dots and they were in a triangular pattern.  It was flying quite fast and very low.  Maybe about 200 ft up.  He continued driving and I continued staring.  We eventually drove behind the trees.  We reemerge from trees and it was nowhere in sight.  This was right behind the Marlborough airport but was most definitely not a plane.;42.3491000000001;-71.5431000000002
