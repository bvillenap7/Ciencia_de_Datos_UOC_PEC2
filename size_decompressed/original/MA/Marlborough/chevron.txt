I’m not sure of the height, but the object would have been hidden by a quarter, placed in front of me at arm’s length.  It seemed to float, moving slightly back and forth.  I immediately thought it was a hawk soaring on thermals, as I’ve seen them in this area before. This lasted about 5 minutes, and then the object moved away from me and was beyond the horizon in just a matter of 3 to 5 seconds, without leaving any type of contrail.  That’s when I realized it wasn’t a hawk, nor an airplane, because of the great speed at which it disappeared.  I’ve watched high-flying jets and they literally take minutes to travel from directly overhead to the horizon.;42.3491000000001;-71.5431000000002
