Large light hovering in the eastern sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Jupiter, we suspect.  PD));2013-09-30 01:30:00;3+;Large light hovering in the eastern sky Saw a light in the eastern part of the sky, tried to zone into the light...as I did the light seemed to get brighter.  I have seen it a few early mornings as well.  I have also seen it in the sky in the same position last year (east), although last year around this time there were also multiple red lights as well seemingly flashing on and off... The lights last year seemed to get brighter and dimmer as well.  The seeming vehicle did not move in the sky, only got brighter and dimmer.  It also got dimmer as a plane was coming seemingly towards it from the north. thank you, I am only posting this to see if others had seen something similar. ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Jupiter, we suspect.  It is very prominent in the eastern sky, at the hour indicated, currently.  PD));42.8539;-70.9396999999999
