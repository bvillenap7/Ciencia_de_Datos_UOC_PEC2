PD));2005-04-09 21:40:00;60 MINS+;blinking bright light greenish, yellow, red in NW sky on NH MA border. sitting looking out large window facing lake.  just above the tree line (north westerly) saw bright blinking greenish light.  thought it was airplane but did not move just sort of hovered.  stayed in same place for about 45 mins then began to move in a way that south and downward in the sky.  looked thru binoculars and was only still able to see light but seemed to be vibrating and changing color yellow green red but mostly green.   went outside to see if it was some sort of reflection off my window but it was still there in the sky.  sky black, very clear, lots of stars but none like this. stayed in that same spot for about an hour then slowly drifted to the right and downward very very slow.
