8-12 steady whitish-yellow and red lights low in the sky (no osund heard).;2016-07-25 21:10:00;5;8 to 12 steady whitish-yellow and red lights low in the sky (no osund heard) We had a group of between 8 to 12 steady (not blinking) lights (some red and some whitish-yellow like car lights) low in the sky in the north.  They were moving slowly and not in any formation.  They moved around, changed positions, and were erratic. Some further away came up to form a small group of lights.  No sound could be heard.  They came from the northeast towards us then took an abrupt turn and headed north.  An airplane did fly by in a straight line west to east during the time and we could hear it as well as see its blinking lights.;42.8539;-70.9396999999999
