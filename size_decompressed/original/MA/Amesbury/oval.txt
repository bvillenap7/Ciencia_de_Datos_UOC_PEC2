A Blimp shaped craft witnessed December 20th, 1983 near Amesbury, Ma. USA;1983-12-20 22:00:00;5 minutes;A Blimp shaped craft witnessed December 20th, 1983 near Amesbury, Ma. USA Report of sighting of a UFO December 20th, 1983.  Time: 9:00 PM to 11:00 PM EST.  Route 95 North, traveling towards Maine.  I picked up a hitch hiker trying to get back to Maine, and about a half hour after picking him up, we saw crossing the Highway a large blimp shaped craft the size of a football field wide, and it was glowing a bright amber light, as if it was lit up from the friction causing heat to make it glow like a coal in a fire place. It was in front of us, as I stopped the car on the Highway about 100 to 200 yards ahead of us, and about 200 yards up over the highway. It was not a blimp, nor a plane, not a fireball, nor a helicopter or jet.  It had a powerful low pitched sound like humming and we watched it slowly move across the Highway and was only traveling about 20 to 30 mph since we were able to look at it as it moved across and kept traveling east over the Atlantic Ocean and then curved upwards and disappeared into the sky. It was real, I know it was not from this Earth.  I was honored to see it, I was not scared, just awestruck to open my eyes to see it as clear as I could.  The hitch hiker and I had fun the whole ride to his house in Maine.  It was reported on the radio from Kansas to Maine that night. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

Whitish blue oval craft seen becoming brighter than brightest star in sky, and camflauging to totally black.;2008-07-02 23:45:00;still there;Whitish blue oval craft seen becoming brighter than brightest star in sky, and camflauging to totally black. Yesterday night, July 1st, I noticed a bright whitish blue light in the southeastern sky. It hovered in place as it went through cycles of turning its lights on and off. Smaller crafts were seen around the large one. This lasted about an hour and a half, the light got brighter than any star in the sky and dimmed out to totally black many times. I showed my brother, sister, and my sisters friend. Today, July 2nd, I noticed the same whitish blue object in a slightly more east position. I showed my mom, she said she had no idea what it was. I showed my sister again and she spotted a smaller red flashing object in the south western sky. It is still in the sky right now at 11:50 pm, it is totally apart from any stars there are none near it whatsoever. The southern needle of my compass points at the craft and not south. If it returns again I will photograph it with a camera I don't have one handy right now.;42.8539;-70.9396999999999
