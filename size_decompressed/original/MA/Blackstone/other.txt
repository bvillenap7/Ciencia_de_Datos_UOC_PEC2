Football shaped object moving steadily across daytime sky.;2012-10-05 17:50:00;45 seconds;Football shaped object moving steadily across daytime sky. Football shaped object observed in daylght moving southeast at a pretty good rate of speed. Object was very dark colored and was silent.  It kept a very steady course.  There were no wings or anything projecting off of it which was what initially captured my attention.  I could not accurately determine its size or height without anything around it to use for comparison.  It was slightly windy blowing toward the north and the object was moving southeast which rules out a balloon.  There was no wobbling or weaving, it moved eerily straight as it drifted over.;42.0261;-71.5294
