I was standing by a fence from above the Cape Cod Canal with the Bourne Bridge in the back ground, when a orange fireball appeared in the sky not far from the bridge.   The fireball was traveling east moving forward then zigzagged, stopped in mid-air, it then dropped or fell in the sky, then shot off at great speed & it was gone.   It made no sound.;41.7465;-70.5914
Orange fireball at Buzzard's Bay, MA.;2018-07-20 20:30:00;3-5 minutes;Orange fireball at Buzzard's Bay, MA Orange fireball, looked like it had a very tiny darker colored flame at one end. It moved slow & silent in the sky from east to west.  It had just become dark out.  Only one object seen.  Myself & my partner of 20 years are seasonal campers at Bourne Scenic Park where object was observed, (he had never seen an object like that before, I have reported in the past seeing a similar object at the same place) we were the only ones at that section of the park (maybe 18 campsites) to have an outdoor fire going. I am a nurse & he is a retired ((title deleted)) @ Mass ((name of office deleted)).  As we were watching it, we didn't even think of taking a cell phone picture of it, sorry (& stupid)!!!   Note:  the park is minutes from Otis Air orce Base.;41.7465;-70.5914
