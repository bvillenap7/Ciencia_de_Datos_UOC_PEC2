Bright green spere of light, about 3 times the visual size of Venus, tranversed the sky, directly over my location, from WSW to ENE. Object was spotted out sliding glass doors. I calculate my field of view to be about 30 degrees of sky from top to horizon. The object transveresed this arc in 1 1/2 to 3 seconds in a straight line. There are pine trees about 50 yrds from my location, and as the object disappeared into that ridge line, it was not low enough to light the trees or ground, inspite of being very bright. It was about 3 to 4 times the brightness of Venus at it's brightest. Did not appear to be a flare, or meteor, although the speed seemed slower than meteors I have witnessed. I also witnessed an unreported white fireball, at least half the diameter of the full moon, from the same vantage point, EXACT same tragectory, in August 1997. Flight characteristics were similar. Although I found the first sighting very odd, I dismissed it as either a meteor, or some incindiary, because the first, August 97 gave off sparks as it flew. If it was a meteor in August, it seemed to large to have entered the atmosphere unreported.;42.5861;-71.7223
