Craft had lights at each point that were a very bright white.  There were also multi colored lights towards the center of the craft. What made me go outside to look was a low almost bass like sound.  Making a loop around a small area of my neighborhood, it left in the same direction it came.  I came inside and started researching for a forum for sightings like the one I just had.  While I was searching I thought I heard the same type of sound.  Going back outside I saw nothing but heard what to me sounded like just a helicopter, after going outside I could tell they we're two different sounds.;42.7145;-70.9148
