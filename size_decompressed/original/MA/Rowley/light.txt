Light dropping in the sky in Northeastern Massachusetts;2015-08-17 21:00:00;20 seconds;Light dropping in the sky in Northeastern Massachusetts At approximately 9pm (21:00) on Monday the 17th of August, I was putting my dog outside to make her business for the night. My kitchen door roughly faces east.  As a turned south, I noticed I had left my grill out and needed to put it in my shed.  Now the east sky to my left, I noticed a bright light high in the sky out of the corner of my eye. Not really realizing what I was seeing yet, I started to roll my grill towards my shed, but kept looking back to the east sky. It's hard to explaine the color and speed that the item was dropping.  I am color blind, so I cannot tell you what color the light was, but it was dropping in the sky almost at the pace that you would caulk a vertical seam in a tub. The backdrop to the light was the night sky, full of stars. I could not see a cloud, but I can't say it is not possible.  The light did not blink like the 100's of aircraft that pass over my house at night. It also made no sound.  As it was dropping, it disappeared. It disappeared like a plane might into a cloud, except it didn't appear to be any clouds as I could see the night sky full of stars behind it.  I have spent the past week observing the sky and have seen meteors from the meteor showers. This is not the same. The drop was at a controlled, slow speed.;42.7145;-70.9148
