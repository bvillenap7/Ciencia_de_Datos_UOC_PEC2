Tree top fiery shaped after signalling with laser;2017-06-01 21:25:00;5 seconds;Tree top firey shaped after signalling with laser Following working on the outside of my house, I sat down out side with my laser pointer looking into the south east sky.  I targeted some stars in the sky and started doing random patterns of bursts of the laser into the sky.   After only a couple of minutes, a fiery orb travelling from left to right appeared at the tree top level (@50 ft) and disappeared a short number of seconds later.   It was amazing, and scary, all at the same time.;42.7145;-70.9148
