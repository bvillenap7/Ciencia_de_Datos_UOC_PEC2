At approximately 9:50 pm EST I went out front of my condo to have a cigarette.  As a stargazer I looked across the sky to see what was up.  I saw a light that looked like a plane comming from the direction that planes usually fly from in my neck of the woods.  I noticed that this object was different.  It appeared to keep going up as to go into orbit.  There were no marker lights on this object, like the ones aircraft have.  I also noticed the object moving in stages.  It seemed to move a little, then it moved a bit more, as if it got a boost.  I don't think this was an alien craft but I do believe that it was something unusual.  I attempted to run inside and get my Tele Vue refractor telescope to get a better view.  I got the scope set up very quickly however, it was not quick enough.  The object was either to faint to see or was in orbit.  After being very frustrated I went inside to see if any orbiters have been launched today.  The only thing that is close in terms of a launch date is July 11th.  That is when Boeing is launching the AURA ozone layer data collecting orbiter from Vandenburg AFB in California.  Well what ever I saw I am 100% convinced it was not a plane, weather-baloon, or satilite.;42.1447;-71.2542
