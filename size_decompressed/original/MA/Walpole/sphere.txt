Bright white/yellow low flying, fast moving orb in Walpole, MA.;2019-07-09 22:30:00;5 seconds;Bright white/yellow low flying, fast moving orb in Walpole, MA I was taking out the trash when I noticed a bright yellow/white circular object hovering above my neighborsâ€™s house.  It appeared to be about the size of a softball and no bigger than a basketball.   As soon as I looked at it, it moved in a straight line at a high rate of speed, and then vanished after traveling roughly 100 feet.   While moving, the object looked like a shooting star, but was only about 60 feet above the ground.  It made no noise.;42.1447;-71.2542
