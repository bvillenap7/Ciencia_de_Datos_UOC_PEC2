As I was walking north on Yirrell Beach a plane passed overhead. This plane took off from Logan Airport, about 1 mile away, and was traveling west to east.  As I continued my walk an orange ball appeared about a quarter of a mile in front of me.  I thought it was a meteor entering the atmosphere but it stopped and hovered and then a second ball joined it.  I called two friends in the area and they saw them also. The two balls came in from the  north and hovered at about 400 and 500 feet above a hill on which the Winthrop water tower is located.  After about 40 seconds the orbs disappeared. The bottom orb disappeared first.  They both appeared to turn west and then vanished. There was a report on a local website of a person who saw two similar orbs at 19:30 on the same night.  They reported that the balls travelled towards Logan Airport and then disappeared.;42.375;-70.9756
