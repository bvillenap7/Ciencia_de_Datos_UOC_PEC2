Large wedged shaped object, with two large bright lights, and no noise.;2005-01-12 19:30:00;2 - 3minites;Large wedged shaped object, with two large bright lights, and no noise. I was at work one night and my boss sent me on my hour break. I was driving down the road toward the center of town and noticed what i thought were two extremly bright street lights. As i drove closser I saw that the lights were moving slowly across the road and appeared to get much larger than the surrounding street lights. I immediatly felt allarmed and slowed the van to observe the lights. once I got about 100 yards away from it I saw a very large triangular , almost boomerang shaped object hovering mabee 200 feet off the road at a very low altitude (mabee 250 feet). The bright lights were set out on the points of its wings there were no other lights and it made absolutly no noise as i passed it by. About 3 miles down the road I found a spot to turn arround hopping to see it again but it was gone. I told my freinds at work, they didnt belive me, and I went back to work as normal. I couldent have been the only one to see it, the road was fairly busy and other cars were slowwing down to see it.;42.6012;-72.6226
