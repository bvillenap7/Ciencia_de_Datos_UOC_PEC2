I got out of my car walked up the sidewalk with a bag and a box of frozen pizza.  As I was walking, I thought I saw something dark moving accross the sky.  I stoped to confirm if I really saw it.  There was a small plane,I could tell by its lights, higher up and a good distance east of this object.  This object was in a lower flight path and was moving from the north east to the south west, then more south.  It blended with the night sky, and if it was not moving I would not have seen it. I could track it with my eyes, then lose it for a secound, then I would see it again.  I could not make out its shape, I could only see a dark object moving accross the sky.  I live one town over from a small plane type airport,and see many small plans flying at night.  They all have blinking lights and you can tell what they are by the way they fly. I never saw anything like this,all blacked out, no lights, flying not real low, but lower than norma! l.  At the time I was wondering if it was a government drone.  I watched it for about five mins untill it was out of my sight flying south.  I'm posting this wondering if any others in the area saw it?;42.6012;-72.6226
