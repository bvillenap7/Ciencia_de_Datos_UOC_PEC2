White light with no known source fading into a mist without sound on cloudless night.  ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));2009-09-19 20:00:00;30 secs?;White light with no known source fading into a mist without sound on cloudless night To whom it may concern:  I am writing to report a UFO sighting that occurred this evening, September 19, 2009, at approximately 8 p.m. EST in the hills of western Massachusetts. My husband, sons and I were returning home in our car, when I spotted something in the sky. At first glance, I thought it was a helicopter with a spotlight hovering over a house a few houses down from ours. The light made a cone shape with the widest part closer to the earth and the apex was very bright. We pulled into our driveway and got out of the car, and there was no sound coming from it, eliminating the possibility of a helicopter. Then, it appeared as if the “spotlight” retreated into a small cloud or a sort of a mist and faded out. The “mist” quickly dissipated. There is a cloudless sky here tonight, and so whatever the mist was came from the object that we couldn’t see. It was just a light and then it was gone. There was no smell. We have eliminated the possibility of a flare, firework, or aircraft. No lightening. I! t is a clear, starry, cool, late summer, early fall evening. I am at a loss.  I hope I have described this adequately enough.  Thank you  J.G. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));42.6012;-72.6226

Approx 10 miles Out I witnessed a small bright light moving Slowly and erratically downward.  It then came to A semi stationary position as other smaller Lights seemed to dance around it.  It was fairly Distant and not easily discerned with the naked Eye, but it became obvious that the brighter object seemed To be taking evasive action from the more numerous Small lights. The swarm of lights often seemed To shine blue headlight beams at the larger light Wich returned in similar fashion.  Eventually the The action moved to far away towards Northampton To see clearly.;42.6012;-72.6226
