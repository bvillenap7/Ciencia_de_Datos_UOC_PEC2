Saw what seemed to be 2 bright stars, one much bigger and brighter, and a smaller something in the sky as well. The smaller UFO I followed across Great Bay, it was egg-shaped and a fiery orange glow. No noise, just seem to float across the sky. My friend finally ran out and saw the last 10 secs. No structure, one glowing orange color, no noise...and then disappeared. Less than a minute later I looked for the 2 bright stars, explaining to my friend where it had started...the bigger and brighter star was gone. I feel like the one we saw more closely and detailed was a distraction from seeing the bigger UFO(only saw that still, but then was gone). I an a USAF veteran and my friend is a Boston Public School Administrator. I am a single mom who was taking a night away at my friend's Cape house. What a perfect eve it was. Clearest sky I had seen in a long time. I will be looking for! more. Mind blown.;41.5694;-70.6152
