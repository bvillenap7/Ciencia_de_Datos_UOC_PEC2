Second hand information.   While the witness was traveling by the Woods Hole Golf Course heading toward West Falmouth, she noticed a triangle of non blinking lights in close proximity.  She stopped her car and turned off her music to notice there was no sound.   She described the craft as being apparently close to the ground and expected to hear the loud drone of a low flying aircraft.   The three lights apparently marked the edge of the craft.   Her account is as follows three non blinking lights were seen moving in a steady course from Woods Hole, Mass.  They were in close proximity to houses in the area.  The apparent craft did not emit noise.  The two aft light were led by a single light and appeared to outline a craft which moved disproportionately slow for its relative distance and appeared extremely large.  The craft, at one point, pivoted instead of like the banked turn of an aircraft.  The craft did not leave but was not seen thereafter.;41.5694;-70.6152
