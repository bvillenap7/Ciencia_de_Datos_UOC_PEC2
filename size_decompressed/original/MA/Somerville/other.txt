Walking outside at 17:00 to dinner with family, looked up at the rising moon and noticed a bright object just to the left—looking exactly like a planet (size and brightness).  On our walk to the car (about 100 yards) we looked up again.  The object was now higher in the sky than above, which doesn’t make sense if it was a planet.  Once we reached the car the brightness had diminished significantly.  It actually looked to have disappeared…but upon closer focus there seemed to be multiple objects, smaller and dimmer. Luckily, I had a pair of 10x40 binoculars in the car.  We got those out as quickly as possible and focused on the spot where the object(s) originally existed.  This is when I noticed what looked like debris in the area where the object was originally.  The largest “piece” of what was originally there started to fall toward earth.  I shared the use of the binoculars with my wife.  She verified that the object was there and falling toward earth.  We kept watching until it vanished from our view.;42.3874547945206;-71.1022602739726
