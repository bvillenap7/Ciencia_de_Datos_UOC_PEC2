While celebrating New Years Eve,  My friend and I heard fireworks. When we went to the window to look, we saw 3 orange and yellow in color oval shaped objects moving sideways when one went behind the other looking like there was only 2 objects, then seamingly that one either slowed down or the other sped up making the 3rd object visable again.  While we watched 3 more orange and yellow in color oval objects appeared.  They were not airplanes or helicopters, because there was no noise.;42.3874547945206;-71.1022602739726
