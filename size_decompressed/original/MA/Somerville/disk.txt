A blue and green disc-like object floated down, there was no noise so we were confused as to what it was.  We assumed it was far away because of the lack of noise.  But when it stopped moving, we realized it was only about a mile away from us, and then hovered for around 3 minutes mid air.  The colors were emitted by a light that encompassed the entire craft, and it seemed like an aura and not light beams. It then lowered towards the ground out of our sight.  There was no noise coming from this object when it was lowering.  We were still on the patio 40 minutes later when a helicopter ascended from the same area.  However, the difference was that we could hear the helicopter as it was taking off and for the rest of the duration it was in the area.  The lights on the helicopter were colored red and yellow, and it was clear to what it was.;42.3874547945206;-71.1022602739726
