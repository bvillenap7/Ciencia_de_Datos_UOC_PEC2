Bright white light streaking across sky.;2017-09-25 22:05:00;5 seconds;Bright white light streaking across sky Bright pure white light streaked across the sky above my house in a densely populated area.  No sound and moving very fast.  Was not a drone, helicopter or plane.   The light was very bright and moving at a high rate of speed in a north-northeast direction.;42.3874547945206;-71.1022602739726
light, non-blinking, solid, fast, trajectory towards the ground;2017-12-19 17:30:00;2 seconds;light, non-blinking, solid, fast, trajectory towards the ground Driving home from work on route 16 heading towards Assembly Row and a ball of light, non-blinking shot across the sky and towards the ground.  Lasted 2 seconds and very very fast. It was a normal light color and i dont know how far it really was but i know it was way too fast to be a plane becasue planes fly higher up with the blinking lights and dont go as fast as this was moving.  It happened in a blink of the eye and the way i was facing it went from my right across to the left and looked like it was heading to crash into the ground but i didnt see where it landed, too far away from where i was;42.3874547945206;-71.1022602739726
