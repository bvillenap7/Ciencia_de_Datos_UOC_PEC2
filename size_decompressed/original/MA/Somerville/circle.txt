A shadow of a light circling around and around in the sky, in a big circle.  ((NUFORC Note:  Advertising lights?  PD));2015-11-07 00:10:00;4 minutes;a shadow of a light circling around and around in the sky, in a big circle looking at stars on clear night...  Then saw a light circling rather quickly, in a horisontal strobe, making a big circle.  I only it flashing past the white clouds as it passed by them, I saw nothing against the dark sky, only as it circled back around to hit the white clouds.  I saw no beam originating from anywhere.  It quickly circled around many times, in a perfect circle. When the clouds floated away, I no longer saw the light....very strange, never saw anything like this before.;42.3874547945206;-71.1022602739726
