4 glowing orange orbs paired off in twos and moving sequentially before fading into the night sky;2013-09-21 01:00:00;30-40 seconds;4 glowing orange orbs paired off in twos and moving sequentially before fading into the night sky I stepped onto my porch a little past 1am on September 21st, and immediately noticed 4 glowing orange circular orbs -- all noticeably larger, and brighter than stars, and headed eastward.  They were paired off in twos.  The first pair swarmed toward and then away from each other in a very succinct manner.  They were glowing brighter than their neighboring pair.  The second pair was to the left, and lower in the sky than the first pair, but they were all in the same vicinity.  The brighter pair started to fade and eventually disappeared into the night sky.  The second pair grew brighter when the first pair first started to fade.  They were interacting in the same manner as the first pair -- almost like a well rehearsed dance between partners.  They too started to fade and after a few more seconds faded completely into the night.  The whole sighting lasted about 30-40 seconds.
