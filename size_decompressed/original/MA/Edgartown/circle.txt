It was almost overhead traveling from west to east in the southern sky, there was absolutely no sound. It looked  bright white with a halo around it like a very large bright star. It was a very clear night with lots of stars. It seemed to be traveling about the speed of a jet at 30,000 feet We saw it for about 50 sec. very brightly then it faded quickly and disappeared We also saw 2 satellites just before the sighting, and a shooting star.;41.3868;-70.535
