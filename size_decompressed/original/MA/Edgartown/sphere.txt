Bright sphere descending, hovering over Cape Cod, and ascending.;2012-10-16 20:00:00;Unknown;Bright sphere descending, hovering over Cape Cod, and ascending. I live in a north facing, waterfront home on the coast of a small island named Chappaquiddick.  The living room windows give a full view of Nantucket Sound and the shores of Cape Cod in East Falmouth and Mashpee.  On Tuesday night I saw a very bright light with a circular shape descending until it came to a pause, hovering over Cape Cod.  During this time I grabbed my camera and photographed it. After just two shots it gradually began to hover and rise east.  Then it began to accelerate and was gone. This ball of light’s diameter was much larger than any spot lights I’ve ever seen.  When it moved, the light never lost its spherical shape.  Its motion seemed to defy the effects of momentum in a way nothing human made I know of could move.  Wind was not a possible explanation either. I was able to adjust the shutter speed enough to get a better look at it (kind of like adjusting to get the structural details of a full moon in a photo).  The light was so bright in the night sky that my eyes couldn’t make out any structure.   I am an amateur photographer but I’ve had practice with this sort of application snapping pictures of full moons. The pictures reveal a well defined, circular shape with a strange red hued pink/purple center and orange outer ring.  Did anyone else see this?;41.3868;-70.535
