3 fast moving erratic lights over Edgartown, MA;2020-02-22 01:45:00;it kept going;3 fast moving erratic lights over Edgartown, MA My husband and I were in bed and the stars were very bright through a transom window. I first saw a really cool meteor that was the largest I'd ever seen. From my view it was baseball size and was heading toward the Atlantic Ocean. Shortly after I noticed a star that was moving around like it was a bug. I asked my husband if he saw the odd star that was moving around. He saw it too. It was very weird so I got out binoculars. Through the binoculars it was 3 lights moving around erratically. The lights were doing loops and squiggles and leaving trails of light in their paths. This went on nonstop. I am 56 and my husband is 59. We are college graduates and own a small business. We were totally sober and just trying to fall asleep.;41.3868;-70.535
