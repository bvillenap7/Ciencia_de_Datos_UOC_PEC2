About 11:00 the night before our wedding she and I were standing on a small dead end road far outside of the center of Edgartown, MA looking up and enjoying the beautiful night sky.  It was a very clear night so the sweeping streak of the Milky Way and billions of other stars were visible that night.  The ground was very dark because there was no moon in the sky at the time.  A single very large black triangular shaped object creeped very slowly in over us blocking out the stars.  The object was completely silent and had no lights on it at all.  It appeared to be at a low altitude, maybe 100 ft or less, possibly at treetop level.  It was such a deep black that we could only discern its shape by the stars which were blocked out by it.  Its size was large enough to block out most of the sky over us.  We were both stunned as the point of its nose slowly wedged itself into our view but then a calm fell over both of us and we didn't utter a word.  We weren't quite sure of the duration of the event because neither of us could remember it leaving.  It was strange because at the time we both acknowledged that this had happened but we never told anyone in the wedding party nor discussed it much with each other after that.;41.3868;-70.535
