Triangle craft with white lights flew over Wakefield, MA.;2019-01-21 16:00:00;30 seconds;Triangle craft with white lights flew over Wakefield, MA, Triangle shaped craft, with solid white lights in each corner, flying below cloud level.  At a distance sounds like a low plane but as it got closer it became much more high-pitched than any plane I've ever heard.  Flew over my house going North while I was outside in a hot tub by myself.   My dog who was inside was and started barking at the same time.  Flew in a straight path.  Weather was thick, low cloud cover, very fine light snow, low wind, 4 degrees Fahrenheit.;42.4945;-71.0715
