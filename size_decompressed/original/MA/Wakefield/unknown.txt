It was bright because the sun was shining off of It.  It was not giving off a bright light, its gray color was magnified, but the sun.   It could have been circular or square but not in the least similar to the shape of a plane.  We both noticed it at the same time that's why it was so weird.  It snuffed out and completely disappeared from the sky after about 10 seconds.;42.4945;-71.0715
