5 Red/Orange lights, turn to 3, then disappear on July 4th, Wakefield, MA;2010-07-04 21:30:00;8-10 mins;5 Red/Orange lights, turn to 3, then disappear on July 4th, Wakefield, MA I spotted 5 orange/ red objects in the sky, for about 5 seconds before they went behind a batch of trees ( 3 trees) These objects were in the shape of / or a ladder i guess you can say. About 15 seconds later, the top light emerged from behind the trees, and proceeded across the sky. This light was in a perfect line going across the sky. It moved slowly at times, and few times picked up a little speed. I told my girlfriend to take a look and she began observing as well. About a minute later, the second light emerged and started a similar path, never moving up or down. The light was a bit dimmer than the original 5 cluster sighting. The top one moved a bit slower, while the second one looked as if it were catching up to it. A 3rd light came out, and went across the sky about half way towards the 2nd and then seemed to almost stop in place. We kept watching the 2 lights that had appeared first. The first moved slowly across the sky. The 2nd faded away, but then seemed to get a bit brighter and literally reappearing.  This happend about 3 times, before staying away, while the first continued across the sky until going behind a patch of clouds, and our attention being redirected to the fireworks beginning. During this time, the lights varied in distance from each other.  We saw planes going across the sky, and were much faster than these lights, so a plane is out of the question.  You could have drawn a straight line across the sky like a ___ and the lights would have never varied from the paths.;42.4945;-71.0715
