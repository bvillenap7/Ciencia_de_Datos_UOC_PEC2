Glowing amber lights flying silently in a triangle formation;2011-08-10 22:00:00;3 minutes;Glowing amber lights flying silently in a triangle formation Saw glowing Amber lights flying in an upside down triangle formation.  Completely silent.  Two broke off and disappeared.  The third on followed. A fourth amber light appeared directly overhead.  It was not as low as the other three. Again there was complete silence, no engine noise.  It too disappeared into the clouds. I called out of curiosity the police to see if anyone else had seen the glowing amber lights and they confirmed that people were reporting the same thing I saw.
