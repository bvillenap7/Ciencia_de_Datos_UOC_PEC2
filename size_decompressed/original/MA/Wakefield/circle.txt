Rapid moving circular pattern of green light;2007-06-10 21:30:00;6 minutes;Rapid moving circular pattern of green light Noticed a flicker in the streetlight which made me look up.  Observed green light moving in very fast circle over neighbor's house when i went to take out trash - movement was rather jumpy and not smooth, but rapid. took 5 seconds to complete a wide rough circle.  there was some low cloud cover, and object appeared to be above lowest level of clouds, but not too high in the sky.  called my son out to witness it also. at first thought it might be a searchlight.  when i moved (and my son stayed still) light appeared to move in the same direction - still circling. When camera phone was aimed at sky to take video, light disappeared from view completely. Son did capture a strange looking arc of light on his cellphone even though we could no longer see anything in the sky. Will watch again tomorrow night at same time to see if it re-appears.;42.4945;-71.0715
Bright white light that shot across the sky and then disappeared.;2013-12-13 17:30:00;30 seconds;Bright white light that shot across the sky and then disappeared. Very bright white light that shot across the sky at a very fast speed with a dim white tail and then just disappeared.  Seemed much brighter and much larger than a falling star and completely disappeared in a second.;42.4945;-71.0715
I saw a bright lighted circle just above a tree which then quickly dipped straight down behind the tree blocking my vision of it.;2014-07-29 21:40:00;3 seconds;I saw a bright lighted circle just above a tree which then quickly dipped straight down behind the tree blocking my vision of it. I walked out of my house to take out the trash, and I saw a large, brightly illuminated white circle just above a tree across the street.  It then immediately dipped behind the tree and I couldn't see it any more.   Many planes go over my neighborhood on their way to and from Logan, so I know it wasn't a plane.  It was much too large and amorphous to have been a plane,traveled too fast, and dipped very quickly straight down.   I knew I had seen something inexplicable, and I am a keen observer of the skies.   I have never seen anything like this before, and my heart was pounding with fear.;42.4945;-71.0715
Orange lights meteor like object flies overhead;2016-07-03 21:54:00;120 seconds;Orange lights meteor like object flies overhead While outside on my porch smoking a cigarette and speaking with a friend on the phone when I noticed what appeared to be a meteor moving South to North around 3000 feet in the air.  As it moved closer I noticed no sound and about six orange lights below the object. I was taken aback when it moved sideways briefly then returned to its northern movement always keeping the same height from what I could observe. As it slowly passed overhead I was able to stare directly up at it and I've never seen anything of the sort in my life.;42.4945;-71.0715
