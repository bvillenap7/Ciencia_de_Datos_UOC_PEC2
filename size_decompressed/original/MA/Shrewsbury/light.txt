Green streak shooting across sky;2004-10-28 22:45:00;5 seconds;Green streak shooting across sky I was driving alone and saw a green streak of light shoot across the sky near junction of Rte. 20 and Rte. 9.  Was close enough to the earth where if it were a jet, I would have definitely heard it.  Yet, there was no sound.  It moved very quickly and went over the tree line where I lost sight of it.  I saw many aircraft in the area shortly thereafter in an area where there isn't usually much commercial airline traffic.;42.2831;-71.7237

It was making a circular pattern then would suddenly and quickly dart forth in a straight line, and then dart straight straight back along the same line, then resume the circular pattern, much like a helicopter would do while circling. Except it seemed way too high for a helicopter and a helicopter could not move as fast in a straight line as this single light did.;42.2831;-71.7237
Bright light heading east. No sound. Just after dusk.;2013-12-27 17:10:00;5 Minutes;Bright light heading east.  No sound.  Just after dusk. Looking eastward towards Boston. This light came from the northwest and flew east, then turned southeast with a 20-30 mile travel distance (estimated).   I ran inside to check four flight tracking websites, NASA's ISS locator and nothing I could find confirmed an aircraft.  No engine sound.  Brightness stayed consistent during observation with no variation which would indicate beacon lighting.  Second time over two months this was witnessed.;42.2831;-71.7237
2 lights appeared right in front of airplane I was watching in the sky. They were close together, then moved apart and further from air;2017-02-19 14:00:00;~5 minutes;2 lights appeared right in front of airplane I was watching in the sky.  They were close together, then moved apart and further from airplane as it passed by them, then 5 more lights appeared.  One larger with a smaller light on opposite sides, another one a little smaller and  the rest same size as the first 2.  They moved in regards to each other a little, didn't make a symmetrical formation, flew from north-west to south-east at steady speed.   I ran home to get the camera, when I got back, they disappeared except 1 small one.  It disappeared within a minute or so.  I didn't get a good shot.  :(;42.2831;-71.7237
