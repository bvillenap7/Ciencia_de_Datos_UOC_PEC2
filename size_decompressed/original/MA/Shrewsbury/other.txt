Two of us driving east on Route 20 in Worcester on way to early movie. I looked up in sky, only to see a silver object sitting in a clear blue sky (it glinted in the sun).  My friend(the driver,who tends to be a skeptic) confirmed that she saw it too.  We lost sight of it as trees obscured our view, and we had to make a left hand turn.  This is a very busy highway, and there was no chance to pull over to try to take a picture. My friend recalls it as being crescent-shaped my impression was of a slim rectangle.  I am retired she is a high school science teacher we are are both college graduates.  On returning from the movie, I scanned the same area of the sky (only travelling west now) to see if I could see it again (thinking it could have been an advertising balloon, but too far up for that really), but did not.;42.2831;-71.7237
