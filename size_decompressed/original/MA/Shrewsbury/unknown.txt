I left my dashcam on.  The dashcam picked up the entire sighting.  I saw the ufo while reviewing the dashcam sd card that evening.  I never saw the ufo myself.  My car was facing north.  The ufo was going west to east at great speed.  The ufo was only a small speck on the screen.  There were fair weather clouds in the sky at the time.   The ufo went through a small clearing in the sky then proceeded behind a cloudy patch then through another clearing then off the screen. I will send you some video as soon as I can have the dashcam five minute video segment shortened.                                                                                    In summary I believe this is one sighting that is truly authentic. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be quite serious and sober-minded.
