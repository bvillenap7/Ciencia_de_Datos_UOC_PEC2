From the road, I could see the tops of the city's skyscrapers. From the distance, I assumed the craft to be an airplane landing at the local airport. Two things bothered me about the thing. One, it seemed larger than most aircraft I have ever seen land there. Two, it glided in towards the city and did not seem to be any color of any airplane I have ever seen, either. Also, it glowed with a strange orange lumininous crackle, and when I looked at it for very long, it hurt my eyes to do so. Black dots seemed to float around this thing, but I thought it might have been a trick of my eye. The thing seeming larger might have made its location closer rather than further. Again, it was very unusual. I am sure that it was not the sun, or a falling star. I am convinced that it was a vehicle meant for airflight, but not of any human construction that I know. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness might have observed an airliner landing, with the rising sun reflecting off of its surface.  That is only a guess.  PD));42.2796;-71.1282000000001

I believe I had a Close Encounter of the First Kind. I was in the basement of my house, watching TV, and I looked outside and saw one oval-like light going across the sky at a little bit faster [from the perspective of the viewer] than a normal commercial airplane. It moved in a continuous line. I only saw it for a few seconds. Conclusion: CLOSE ENCOUNTER OF THE FIRST KIND ONE OBJECT VALLEE SYSTEM TYPE: TYPE IV-A;42.2796;-71.1282000000001
