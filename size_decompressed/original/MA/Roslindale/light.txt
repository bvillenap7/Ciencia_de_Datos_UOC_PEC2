white light followed by many colored tail streaked across sky.;1999-06-01 20:00:00;3 minutes;white light followed by many colored tail streaked across sky. i was visiting a friends grave with two other friends and we were talking and looking in the sky when suddenly a large ball of light with a long tail made of all different color lights went from one  end of the sky (east), all the way across (west), it was way too big to be a star and it resembled something coming into our atmosphere. i was later standing on centre street in west roxbury and heard a woman ask her husband what he thought the light in the sky was. i heard it and approached them. they had seen the same thing and they were about 3 miles away in another part of boston when they saw it.
