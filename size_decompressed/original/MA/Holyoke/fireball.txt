Unexplained red-orange object seen moving slowly in sky, and then vanishes.;2014-09-28 22:00:00;2 minutes;Unexplained red-orange object seen moving slowly in sky, and then vanishes. While sitting on my porch I happened to glance up at the sky.  I noticed a bright orange object moving very slowly. It did not appear to be very close by, at first I rationalized it to be a plane, but the color was not right for it to be a plane.  I pointed it out to the person I was sitting with.  We continued to watch the object and I noticed its color changed from bright orange to red to orange and back to red and orange again.  My friend mentioned that to him it appeared to be V shaped.  He went back in the house but I continued to watch.  The object then stopped. Just stopped, right where it was in the sky and then it vanished. I watched for quite a few more minutes to see if it would reappear (still thinking it was a plane that perhaps went behind a cloud or something...even though I could see stars where the object had vanished), but it did not.
