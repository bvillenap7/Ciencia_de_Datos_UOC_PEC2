Tom, and we both saw a large craft to the left of the highway over the valley where there are no houses or buildings. It was not moving and very close to the earth. That is was caught our attention. It was very large and dark with lights. I was driving so I couldn't stare too long at it. The passenger in my car was able to get a good look at it and described it as being diamond shaped, like a kite, with white lights on the points. It did not make any noise. It was completely silent. It then moved across the valley going east, flying low, and so smoothly, not real fast, but it was out of sight in a matter of seconds. It was probably going fast, but gave us an illusion of going slower, because it was like gliding over the valley away from us and it didn't make any noise. It really freaked us out. We definitely saw something that night like we'd never seen before. Perhaps our government has some secret aircraft we don't know about or perhaps we witnessed a UFO. Whatever the case, there must have been others who saw it too, because it was near a major highway and during rush hour commute.;42.2051451612903;-72.6273967741935
