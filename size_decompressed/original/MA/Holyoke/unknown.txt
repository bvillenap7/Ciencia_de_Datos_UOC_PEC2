5 unidentified lights travel through the night sky.;2013-09-02 19:18:00;3 minutes;5 unidentified lights travel through the night sky. I was looking through the clearing cloud cover when I noticed a light similar to a street light in the sky.  I continued watching, listening trying to identify the object as a plane when the object appeared to slow in speed.  Then another light appeared in the sky moving at a like speed and height of the first light.  I wondered if they were Military jets returning to Barns Air base in Westfield but there was no sound and the jets are unmistakable and easy to identify.   I called to my wife to come out and watch and as she did the third and fourth and fifth  lights appeared also traveling at a similar height and speed.  With in minutes all five lights traveled out of sight not ever making a sound, never changing direction and never appearing different then lights in the sky.   I will always wonder what exactly it was we witnessed this night. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));42.2051451612903;-72.6273967741935
