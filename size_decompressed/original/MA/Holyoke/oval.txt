There was a faint dull silver green luminous oval object flying in a clockwise rotation,spanning over the river and neighboring houses.;2012-10-13 20:26:00;25 minutes;There was a faint dull silver green luminous oval object flying in a clockwise rotation, spanning over the river and neighboring houses. I was taking my dog outside for a walk.  When I noticed the sky had a purple blue tint and there was a faint dull silver-green luminous object flying from the lower end of my backyard crossing over the Connecticut River.  At first I thought it was a helicopter or a stealth jet or a light beacon due to the air base being near by or a looping shooting star or meteor.  But there was no sound emitting ,nor was there a streamed light source connecting to the sky.   The object was circling in clockwise rotation it reached a full circle in every 3-4 in a half seconds.  The phenomena lasted for roughly 15-20 mins begining from 8:26pm.   It made roughly 60-70 rotations. This has been the first sighting that I have ever witnessed this irregularity to happen in this area.;42.2051451612903;-72.6273967741935
