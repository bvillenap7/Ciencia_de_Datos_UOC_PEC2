Three black metallic orbs;2003-03-22 10:00:00;1.5 min estimate;Three black metallic orbs This happend in the Kmart parking lot on Route 5 mid morning the day of the St. Patrick's Day Parade which was held after the actual holiday. I was looking up in the sky at a balloon that had gotten loose from someone.  (The parade had not started yet and there were at least 200 people in the parking lot preparing for the parade etc. which goes down route 5)  At the time it was overcast.   From the woods behind the shopping center there emerged three black orbs. At first I thought they were balloons.They were like liquid metallic quivering spheres and black as the night sky. They were floating or flying as if controlled.  They stayed together but weren't attached.  At one point they hovered together in one area for maybe 30 seconds then accelerated across the sky to the east so fast I'd say faster then a jet.;42.2051451612903;-72.6273967741935
