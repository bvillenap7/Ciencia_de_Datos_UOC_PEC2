Strange moving light over Holyoke Ma in 1995;1995-04-01 18:00:00;10-20 Minutes;Strange moving light over Holyoke Ma in 1995 When I was 17, my family and I were driving from Northampton south on I-91. It was in the spring, I believe in late April.  When we got close to a rest stop that overlooks Holyoke Ma, we noticed a bright star like white light over the city. At first it looked like a helicopter, and we only noticed it because we kids were in the back seat and looking out the window over the city. The white star then suddenly turned purple and began to do zigzag maneuvers we had never seen an aircraft do. It changed colors from red to blue to purple to green and back to white. There was only one light, and no other lights on it to suggest an aircraft. (No blinking lights etc). Just the steady star-like light that coninued to change color every few minutes.  My father pulled over at the rest stop (this was the one where the old Mt Tom sign used to be years ago) and all 5 of us jumped out of the mini van. We were not the only ones who saw it. Several carloads of people stopped. There might have been as many as 20 folks. We watched it moved in these zigzags, several times appearing to even move against the wind very quickly. It then vanished in an odd way. It almost appeared that the sky slid over it, as if a reflective cover was moved over the light that reflected the sky back at us. No sooner had it vanished than one of the viewers (a young woman) who had turned to go back to her car cried, There it is!  We all turned to see that it had in the span of about three seconds, appeared behind Mount Tom with no noise that we could hear. It then shot straight up into the sky above the clouds and vanished for good. I wanted to report this because this report:  http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/076/S76260.html   Appears to have been seen in the exact same area over 10 years later, and I’m wondering if there is a regular sighting of odd things in the sky.  I’ve not heard myself of much (and I live the in the area.) but I would be interested to know if this is a hotspot for this kind of thing. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));42.2051451612903;-72.6273967741935
Bright red light hovering motionless, then moving slowly while wavering side to side, then slowly fading from red to green to invisible;2014-09-26 20:30:00;2 minutes;Bright red light hovering motionless, then moving slowly while wavering side to side, then slowly fading from red to green to invisible Seen between two houses, a red light hovering at about 2,000-5,000 feet. Thought it was Mars, but was in wrong position. Twice as bright as Venus, and twice the size of Venus. Moved erratically and slowly from south to north, wavering side to side. As it slowed again, it dimmed, turned the light intensity down to nearly invisible and changed color to a pale nearly invisible frost green. Then it disappeared. We were amazed. Fifteen minutes later it reappeared. This time it moved again in the same direction, but disappeared quickly while wavering side to side. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.

He asked me to come look out the window at what at first, looked like a star.  We noticed it kept getting darker and then very bright in an instant, and it would do this slowly fade and come back.  It wasnt normal looking to me whatsoever.  We also saw an aircraft (plane) within the vicinity of this object. The object of light would also occasionally look like arms of some sort (I can describe the arms as looking like Doc Oc's mechanical arms in Spiderman) would appear surrounding the oval light.  This would happen when the light would brighten up with extreme brightness.  Eventually, it disappeared.  The plane did too.;42.2051451612903;-72.6273967741935
