PD)) ((ADDENDUM)) my mom was alittle skecty on the details because it was so long ago most of the witnesses have moved away and have not had contact with my mom since then. Personally I think it was a plane from an afb called westover but she was not sure so we tryed to see if anyone reported it  thank you very much-((name deleted));42.2051451612903;-72.6273967741935
