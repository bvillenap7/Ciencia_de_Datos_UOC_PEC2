Two Circular Objects Traveling in the Sky.;2014-10-13 12:23:00;ongoing;Two Circular Objects Traveling in the Sky. I was stopped at the set of lights in the intersection of Route 9EB and Otis St., just gazing ahead, when two circular objects in the sky caught my vision.  Although it was overcast, I had sunglasses on so I took them off so as to get a better look and convince myself that I wasn’t “seeing things” like spots or anything.  To my intriguing surprise, they were real.   The objects were round like (as if you were to look at a tube from its side) and each had two short legs coming out of them just like what helicopters have so as to land but these had round balls at the ends.  The distance from one UFO to another looked like it may have been maybe 50-70 feet apart (hard to tell when you’re about 200 feet away).  The objects were moving westbound and it didn’t seem as if they were flying fast so as to get away but gave the impression that they were either observing and/or looking for something. Unfortunately the red light changed to green and I had to go.  I quickly drove into the Walmart parking lot that was right there but by the time I parked and got out of my car, I didn’t see the UFOs anymore.;42.3182;-71.6428999999999
