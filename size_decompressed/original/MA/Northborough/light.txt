Triangular formation of 20 + blue lights move around near the moon;2005-04-11 22:00:00;3+ hours;Triangular formation of 20 + blue lights move around near the moon There was a small sliver moon, and just to the right of it I noticed multiple faint blue lights, all clustered very close together.  The lights flickered on and off, and with views from binoculars and telescope, I noticed a definitive triangular formation of identical bright blue lights, all equally spaced apart.  A few of them moved around with no noticeable pattern.  Throughout the whole hour I viewed them they remained just to the right of the moon.  There was a definite difference between these lights and the stars around them.;42.3182;-71.6428999999999
