There was a very bright light in the southern sky that looked like a double star at first. I initially thought it was just a star but then I noticed a red light flash underneath the double star which caught my attention. After observing the object for a few minutes it appeared to be slightly moving around but hovering in the same general vicinity. I also witnessed it flash a green light underneath the double star as well. I witnessed the flashing lights at least 6-7 times but there was no pattern or rythm to it. The flashing light was very much like a light you would see on a plane fying by. I went inside but returned after about 15 minutes. The sun was coming up on the horizon and all the other stars had mostly faded away. This object was still in the same spot and still shining with the same intesity. It was definitely the brightest object in the sky compared to all the other stars. I finally went to bed around 5:00 am. Could this object have been the space station?;42.2647;-71.6175
