Disc Above the Mass Pike;2007-02-04 15:20:00;10 seconds;Disc Above the Mass Pike I was driving to my friends Super Bowl party about to get onto the Mass Pike towards Springfield, MA. As I was taking the onramp to the tolls, I noticed a perfect disc about 20-30 degree on the horizon.  It was perfect disc shape and reflecting the sunlight brilliantly. It remained perfectly still as I was driving slowly for about 10 seconds. Suddenly it jotted off in a blink of an eye, I scanned the sky briefly but saw nothing else out of the ordinary.;42.2647;-71.6175
