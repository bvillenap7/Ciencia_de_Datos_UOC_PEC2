Silvery to almost translucent, pulsating between visible and near invisible. I was driving west on Route 9 in Westborough MA at 1359 23 Sep 98 when a truck in front of me let out a puff of smoke.  The visible smoke did not disipate as I expected. My eyes were then drawn to what was really happening in the sky. What I saw was what appeared to be a funnel cloud rotating and shifting while changing density dark to light. Then this appearant funnel formed into a more roundish but not perfect round object that moved from right to left and then back left to right. Again this movement was accompanied by darkish to near translucent appearance. After just a few seconds the object appeared to me perfectly round, and pulsating between silver and near translucent.  It was if the object was trying to be invisible but not able to achive it totally. I am a very creditable person, a simple software sales person. I can't believe something like this has happened to me. There are no drugs involved here. I am a former member of the Air Force Intelligence Command who was in the right place at the right time on my way back to the office from a simple lunch meal.;42.2647;-71.6175
