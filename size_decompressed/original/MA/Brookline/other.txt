hook shape of multiple small lights gliding silently at night during lunar eclipse;2003-11-08 19:55:00;4 minutes;hook shape of multiple small lights gliding silently at night during lunar eclipse A hook shape comprised of about 30 small white lights (as if two sides of a traingle) moving silently from the northeast and curving across the sky towards the northwest, where it eventually went beyond my sight line. This was during the lunar eclipse. The lights did not change configuration, no blinking. It seemed to maintain a consistent altitude and speed.
