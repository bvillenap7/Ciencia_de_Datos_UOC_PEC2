Black triangular object flying low over Brookline MA in August 1987.  Made no noise, had no lights.;1987-08-15 22:30:00;7 seconds;Black triangular object flying low over Brookline MA in August 1987.  Made no noise, had no lights. I was lying on the roof of a building on a warm summer night.  It was very hot and hazy, to the point where stars were almost not visible because of haze and heavy light pollution from street lights.  As I lay on the roof looking upward a black triangular craft moved right over the building just above me.  It was about 150 above the ground and was completely black.  No lights, but the bottom of this thing was illuminated by the light pollution from the street lights on Beacon Street.  It was clearly a triangular, black object and I wouldn't have seen it if I wasn't lying on my back on a roof!  It was completely silent.  Made no noise whatsoever, and it was only about 100 feet away.   I was too dark to make out any other features.  It was not a conventional aircraft.  Don't know what it was.

Triangle shaped craft sighting over Brookline MA.;2004-10-15 04:30:00;25 secends;Triangle shaped craft sighting over Brookline MA. On October 15th 2004 at about 4:30 am i woke up and looked out my bedroom window my house is on a hill in brookline in the suberbs of boston MA facing east. As i was looking out i looked up and from above my house i saw a medium shaped perfect triangle slowly flying in the north east direction, the triangle had 3 white lights at each point and one blinking red light in the center of the craft and if i had put my hand up to the craft it would be 2 thumbs thick and the left and right tips would just barely stick out at the ends. At that early hour of the morning there was just enough light so that i could see a perfect triangle outline in the dark blue morning sky. My bedroom window was open at the time and the thing that got my attention was that the street was completely silent and this craft was not gliding, not at the slow pace it was moving at and it was completely dead silent no noise whatsoever. I kept watching as it moved north east for about 30 seconds or so and the triangle shaped craft eventually disappeared over the horizon. Theres one more thing i would like to mention that i feel is very important, im not at all a morning person, i never get up early, not since my school days and the thing about that morning is that i woke up and it's almost as if someone or something told me to get up open the blind and look out the window and when i did 5 secends later this triangle shows up. It's as if for some reason unknown i was meant to see that triangle that morning. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));42.3351941747572;-71.1279485436893
UFO over Harvard Street?;2006-11-09 19:30:00;5 minutes;UFO over Harvard Street? I was driving with my girlfriend down Beacon Street between Washtington and Harvard when I noticed a strange formation of lights in the sky.  At first I thought it was just a helicopter, but it had two triangular sets of lights, one of which was blinking.  The other thing I found strange was that it didn't seem to be moving, and if it was, it was doing so incredibly slowly.  We passed under it around the intersection at Harvard Street before I lost sight of it.;42.3351941747572;-71.1279485436893
