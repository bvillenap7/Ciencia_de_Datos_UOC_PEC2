Ovoid , brightly lit unidentified flying object  seen  near Massachusetts city.;2002-10-16 19:00:00;2 hrs.;Ovoid , brightly lit unidentified flying object  seen  near Massachusetts city. An ovoid, glowing form was seen from the top floor of a multi-story home. I(observer)noticed it when lights in room were turned out after sweeping room. It hovered over the trees in a W-SWesterly direction. It was highly lit, more bright around the circumfrence than the center. After several seconds it moved horizontally in an exact line, at a moderatly slow pace, then hovering to a stop behind trees where I could only see silouettes of its light through the branches. I then attemped to follow the object on foot, but not seeing it asked around in some stores near a local parkway about a blimp. No one else saw the object, but I then took a running path around a resevior, and I briefly saw it over the trees, but it then moved out of sight and I was unable to follow it further.
