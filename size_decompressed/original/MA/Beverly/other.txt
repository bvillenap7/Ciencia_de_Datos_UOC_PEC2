Anomalous object hovering over our street at 7:45 PM;2020-07-20 19:45:00;3-4 minutes;Anomalous object hovering over our street at 7:45 PM The sky was still lit and we saw a very oddly shaped object floating about as high as a helicopter would fly, maybe higher.  I ran inside to grab binoculars and my sister and I followed it as it flew west and then curved southeast.  We went onto the street watching it until it was out of our sight.  All of us were unable to figure out what it was even though it was so visible in our binoculars.  When I first saw it it looked like it was on fire, then it just appeared very shiny/sparkly, and could have been brown in color.  The shaped was so odd, scalloped on the top and more box like on its bottom.  We didn't get a photo or video of it. Around this time many citizens all over our town had been reporting that their Comcast internet and cable weren't working.;42.5583;-70.8782000000001
