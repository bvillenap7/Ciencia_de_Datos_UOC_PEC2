2 bright white lights hovering over north shore area of boston;2012-06-24 04:00:00;1.5 hours;2 bright white lights hovering over north shore area of boston while travelling by car on rt 128 N from woburn , ma on june 24, 2012 at 4:00am to beverly,ma i saw 2 bright non-pulsating white lights hovering several miles out ahead of me in the northern sky. one of the lights seemed low in the sky perhaps only a few hundred feet above the ground , the other much higher perhaps several thousand ft high.  both seemed to maintain their relative position. the higher one at approximatly 2 o'clock high. even though i traveled some 15 miles the objects always seemed fairly distant to me.  when i got home i was able to view only the higher object with low powered binoculars.  all i could see was a small very intense white light, no other structural details.   the lights were visible until 5:30am. the may have disappeared or just were no longer visible because of the brightness of the morning sky.;42.5583;-70.8782000000001

Near beach two bright orange/red lights came across the water and went inland.   No sound as the first light went at a constant speed overhead and the second flew with a pronounced change in speed.   Then they both quickly dulled in brightness and vanished.;42.5583;-70.8782000000001
