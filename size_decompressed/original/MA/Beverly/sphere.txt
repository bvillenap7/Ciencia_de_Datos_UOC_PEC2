2 round spheres chasing each other in a counter clockwise elliptical pattern;2013-09-26 00:20:00;20 minutes;2 round spheres chasing each other in a counter clockwise elliptical pattern 9/26/13 00:20 to 00:40 Beverly MA Coordinates N 42 degrees 34.432 minutes W 70 degrees 52.880 minutes. .5 miles north of Beverly High School.  A co- worker and I and saw two white objects ( at first we thought they were search spot lights) travel in a counter clock wise pattern. The two objects would converge on top of each other in the top right quadrant of the elliptical revolution, and stay at that location for about 30 seconds.  The two objects would change speed, but stayed on the same track. The first object appeared to be exiting to the upper left quadrant where the sphere was cut in half, then totally disappeared ( as if going through a door) approximately 15 seconds later the second sphere exited the same way.  The sky had low overcast clouds and there was no sign of a spot light beam.  The spheres were illuminated as if light reflecting down from the clouds.  There was no noise, hum, or vibration.  After the spheres left it looked like there were four dark areas in the clouds, where the spheres were stationary.  This incident  lasted for at least 20 minutes.  We were unable to capture any video due to the halogen lights in our parking lot.;42.5583;-70.8782000000001
Orb seen flying over my neighborhood with blue sky all around.;2020-07-25 15:00:00;1 minute;Orb seen flying over my neighborhood with blue sky all around. Over the past three days I've been seeing sphere shaped UFOs flying directly over my home. The first sighting was of a single sphere which pulsated from black to red.  The second sighting was of two white spheres going in the same direction but one was playing around the other as the flew silently and with no trails over our neighborhood. Yesterday was the third sighting of a single sphere. It was backlit so it appeared dark in color.  I had decided to set-up a rig and get some video and I was successful.  I'll include a photo with this report. The area where I live seems to be a highway of sorts.  So, I'm sure that I'll see more and will attempt better footage.;42.5583;-70.8782000000001
Red/Orange Sphere/Vessel (Radiating/Eminating Shape);2021-08-01 22:00:00;5 Minutes;Red/Orange Sphere/Vessel (Radiating/Eminating Shape) On the evening of 8/1/2021 around 10PM, I was walking past my dining room window and noticed an unusual light eminating through the curtains. This clearly did not make sense to me given the time of day. As I opened my curtains, I saw a large sphere, floating at a standstill, low, above my neighbors building.  The sphere was red and orange in color. Although, the object was a sphere in shape, it did not hold a solid outline, almost as if it was a fireball radiating. As I observed the object, I noticed the radiation of light eminating more from the bottom, less on the top, and nothing on its sides. The sphere stood in its upright position during the interaction and the vessel itself did not seem to be in rotation.  My gaze locked into place as I have never seen anything quite like this. After minutes of staring in disbelief, I had to move past denial and realized I was actually seeing this object.  Toward the end of the 5 minute span, the object started to slowly move north, never really picking up speed, almost as if we were watching each other. Also, the object did not produce a condensation trail throughout the entire duration.  The object did not disappear, it slowly traveled out of my eye sight into the distance. After the whole interaction ended, I realized there were no sounds coming from or around the object during the whole interaction.;42.5583;-70.8782000000001
