The sky was clear, only a few clouds.   I noticed a bright saucer shaped object in the sky, hovering far away directly from the east.  When it appeared to be moving in closer it changed from one saucer to three saucers then it formed a triangle with red, blue, and orange lights coming from the top.  It vanished after 40 mins.  I have never seen anything like this.;42.5583;-70.8782000000001
