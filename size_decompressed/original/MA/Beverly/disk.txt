Large hovering disk with lights over Beverly Commons Cemetary;1975-08-15 18:00:00;2 min;Large hovering disk with lights over Beverly Commons Cemetary Summer early evening (still light out) my friend and I saw a flying disk shaped object with lights rotating around the bottom of it. I believe it also had a light on the top.  It was large and hovering at a slight angle with no sound, a couple hundred feet above trees. We were at the front of my friends house next to the Beverly Commons cemetary. It was a clear summer evening and we watched it until we realized we could not explain what it was and we ran. I never brought it up much since, but on recent return trip to Beverly, my cousins neighbor who still lives near the cemetary also saw the object from his porch. The year sighted may be off a year or two. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));42.5583;-70.8782000000001
