As i was driving to work onthe morning of  1/16/08 i saw what appeared to be blinking lights in the southern sky. i thought that perhaps a satelite or some other debris had fallen and was burning up in the atmosphere. As i kept driving along, the lights became very bright and were blinking and the object seemed to take up one whole quadrant of the sky. Upon reaching my work , i watched the object from the parking lot.  The best explanation i can give is that it looked like a costellation was moving in an easterly direction while flashing its lights all the time.  I thought it could be a formation of at least a dozen or more planes or helicopters, but there was no sound, the lights were too bright and it moved to uniformly. there is a national guard air base nearby but i have lived here for 35 years and never seen anythig like this. I would love to know if anyone else in my area saw this event and has an explanation.;41.6468;-70.6293
