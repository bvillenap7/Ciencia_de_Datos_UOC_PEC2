Red flickering lights over Falmouth.;2012-07-22 21:30:00;15 mins;Red flickering lights over Falmouth. Six red flickering objects looked like baskets, silently gliding through the sky using the same path/trajectory - flames flickering underneath, so not a hot air balloon (flames would push upwards, not downwards).  We were amazed. The following Thursday, I received a text from a friend on a boat in Oak Bluffs (Martha's Vineyard) who saw the exact same thing...we both took photos but they're with our phones, and crappy.
