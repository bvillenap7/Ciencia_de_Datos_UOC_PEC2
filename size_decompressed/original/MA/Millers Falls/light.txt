My boyfriend and I were standing on the French King Bridge above the Connecticut River in Millers Falls, MA, around 8:30 p.m. on April 9th, 2016.  It was a clear, cool night, and the only lights around were the streetlamps that lined the bridge and a few passing cars.  There were no clouds in the sky, the moon was a waxing crescent, and we could see the stars clearly.   My boyfriend was looking up when he pointed out a light that was moving slowly in the sky directly above us.  It was the size and color (white) of a star, and had no distinct shape.  It made no sound, left no visible trail, and was not blinking.   Suddenly, the light moved back and forth erratically in a few different directions, and then shot off into the south sky at what can only be described as the speed of light.  We viewed it for about a total of 15 seconds before it took off into the distant sky.;42.5802;-72.4921
