Alien sighting;1972-03-15 22:00:00;2 minutes;Alien sighting We were Driving home from Greenfield, MA on Route 2, an unlit, two lane highway in rural massachusetts in March 1972.  On this route between Millers Falls and Greenfield are towers or high intensity electrical wires that drape across the landscape for miles. Just off the highway at about 50 feet, we saw an unusual figure at the   base of one of these steel towers.  The shape looked human (two arms and two legs) however, the whole body glowed.  Imagine a dark room and you are flipping channels on the TV - the figures resembled the snow on the inbetween channels of a tv.  It was so bright.  We stopped our car at the edge of the road.  It started to walk toward us - we were petrified and quickly left.  Looking behind you can see the figure twisting to follow our departure.  We promised never to tell anyone for fear that people would think we were nuts.  Some weeks later, that same sighting was reported in the Enquirer solidifying that we would really never tell anyone.  However, must exposure  today warrants me telling my story without fear. ((NUFORC Note:  Date in March 1972 is approximate.  PD));42.5802;-72.4921
