Whitish light with red light/s flash left and then right at odd intervals;2006-08-16 23:15:00;about 30 minutes;Whitish light with red light/s flash left and then right at odd intervals My boyfriend and I were out so he could smoke a cigarette. We noticed what we at first thought was a star, a pulsing blue/white light. As we both looked at it, it appeared that a red light danced first to the left and then the right. The light did not appear to move, and although we live close to an AFB, we wrote it off as not being a plane. It did not move at all. We saw the red light/s blink several times, and then tapped on our neighbor's window. She came out and confirmed that yes, the light stood still, and yes, the red light went left and then right (she said this without us having mentioned it). The light then seemed as if it were getting lower. It started appearing smaller and sinking about 30 minutes after we noticed it, until it dissapeared behind neighboring buildings. The light did not appear in photographs or on video we tried taking.;42.1748232894729;-72.5788369736826
