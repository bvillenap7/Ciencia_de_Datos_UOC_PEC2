I am a 19 year old student, attending college (STCC) for video production.  I have made the Deans list twice my first two semester and am a straight A student.  I am skeptical as to what UFO are and who pilots them.   As for the sighting, we were getting of the Massachusetts Turnpike when my younger brother saw an orange light in the distance.  He pointed it out and me and my mother looked and saw it moving towards us fast. My brother said, it's a UFO, and insisted that we pull into a Walgreens' parking lot to get out of our car and look at the object.  To our surprise, the object slowed once over us as if it wanted to be seen.  The object was like a ball of fire.  We could see the flames along the outside of the object.  I estimate the object was between 200 and 500 feet above us, (which I understand to be a rough estimate).  All I know is that it was low enough to see that it was on fire and flickering.  As it slowed and passed overhead, we watched the object Grow dimmer and dimmer until it's flame became a flicker, and it's flicker fade until the object disappeared.  That was the last we saw of it.

I thought not much of it until I saw 7 or more of them.  Still not alarmed I just thought wow that is quite a few of them. I was with my kids and talking on the phone so i kept driving.  Then, after looking back up the lights had become small orange/yellowish contained orb like objects and had organized themselves into a near arch looking patten but not perfect symmetry.  There were lined up directly with the highway.  I was swearing into the phone(which I DON'T DO) Because I couldn't believe what I was seeing. People on the highway were all honking their horns so i know others were seeing this. As is approached me I eventually was under and going past it.  As they were close to me, I would describe the orange/yellowish objects almost as if they were perfect self contained fireballs.  I looked to the left as I passed and there was an object, very very dark black following just behind to the left.  I can't tell you how eerie it is to see something appear that black against an already night sky.  It was strange to say the least.  I tried in every way to rationalize it I could not.  I pulled over off the exit and got out of my car to look up and process what I just saw. We DO live very close to the military base.  I have lived here my whole life and I can say to you not one person familiar with military craft would be able to identify these things.  The defied any shape and color of anything I have seen.  The black object was the most obviously deep black object you have ever seen and odd/scary to see.;42.1748232894729;-72.5788369736826
