A white silver object was seen flying and then disappeared;2019-04-01 18:00:00;~30 seconds;A white silver object was seen flying and then disappeared I was at my job.  I work at chicopee Wal-Mart.  I work outside as a cart pusher,  I was standing outside, when one of my coworkers spotted a white silver object.  It was flying at a low altitude, so it was easy to watch this object as it moved across the sky.  It was a clear day, so there were almost no clouds in the sky.  As I watched the object, it faded away and disappeared.  This object appeared to be a solid structural craft of some kind.  It didn't change color or leave a trail.  No other objects came out of it.  The object didn't make any noise that I heard.  3 other coworkers reported seeing this object, as well. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It moved soundlessly in a way that seemed to not catch the eye. The object was rocket shaped with a sharp nose that had short long fins.  It was black and seemed to have an ash or burnt look about the surface.  The object was about 20 feet from the passenger side of the car window.  It was traveling east to west along the Chicopee River.  Its speed seemed slow in a strange unnoticeable way. The object caught my attention because he said,I think I just saw a UFO.  I looked to my right and the object appeared.  When I said, Its like a black rocket, he said no it was a bright flash in the sky.;42.1748232894729;-72.5788369736826
