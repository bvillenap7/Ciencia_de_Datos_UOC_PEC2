White disk flying over park;2004-05-30 16:00:00;1 minute;White disk flying over park My boyfriend and I were in the park, lying down on the bleachers.  It was a clear day, and were were watching the clouds.  I saw a round white object flying over me, at a higher altitude than the planes we'd seen flying by.  It was flying from north to south, and when it got near the sun, it tilted and we could see that it was a disk, and there was a bright metallic shine off of the rim.  After it tilted, it disappeared.  There is a military base in the city, but there were no military planes chasing the object... in fact, there was no air traffic of any kind for the next half hour.;42.1748232894729;-72.5788369736826
