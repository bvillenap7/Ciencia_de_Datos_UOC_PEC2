UFO sigting in the skies of chicopee;2009-09-07 06:15:00;3 mins;UFO sigting in the skies of chicopee This Morning on my morning commute I seen something I never seen before in the skies.  I usually chop these things up to a aircraft from the Westoveer base, but I seen it as clear as day and there is no way we can reach those speeds.   I was traveling on 391 towards Springfield. I looked up in the sky and noticed a very bright light, it was blinking at first, I didn't think nothing of it because thats common to see here.  But when it stopped blinking then took off and in a split second it was gone. It was so fast my eyes could not keep up with it.  All I seen was it just take off. It took off so fast I could no longer see it anywhere, and the sky's were clear, no clouds.   I am scratching my head trying to think of a logical explanation and for the first time I don't have one.  I seen it so clearly it freaks me out.;42.1748232894729;-72.5788369736826
