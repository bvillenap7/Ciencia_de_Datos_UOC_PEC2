VERY bright object with 3 circular lights in an oval pattern very low in the sky.;2019-02-12 19:00:00;on going;1900 hours during a snow storm looking in the direction of Springfield, Ma., from Chicopee, Ma. Center to the left or East in the night sky there is a VERY bright object with 3 circular lights in an oval pattern very low in the sky.  Bright enough that there is an illumination at almost ground level from the object.  Then to the West at a further distance in the night sky there is another similar object in the sky.  It does not seem as bright due to the distance.  Both objects have been stationary in the night sky for over an hour so far.  Craziest thing I have EVER seen.  Also, after about 15 minutes or so I noticed cars stopping to observe the  Bright object to the east.  Also, we started hearing alot of sirens after awhile.;42.1748232894729;-72.5788369736826
