I was standing outside, facing West, and observed 2 round whitish yellow lights, one right behind the other traveling east.  There was light cloud cover, so I couldn't see anything other than the lights which caught my attention because they were moving much too slowly to be an airplane or helicopter.  Both objects were completely silent.  My cell phone totally shut off  and my daughter said the tv stopped working.  Lights in the house also seemed to flicker and dim for the few minutes the lights moved over the neighborhood.  I live close to Westover air reserve base but everything that ever flies by makes some sort of sound, these didn't.   Within 1 minute of me first observing the lights I could hear the helicopters start their engines over at the air force  base.  Within 3 minutes of the helicopters starting they were flying over my house more quickly than I've ever seen, headed in the same direction as the lights.  They were totally black military helicopters, which I've never ever seen fly at night. Usually, they're only used in training during the day mostly on weekends as that's when the reservists train.  The lights caught my attention at first because of their slow speed and silence, my suspicions were confirmed as soon as I saw the black helicopters proceeding so quickly, as if on a mission, travelling the same exact route that the lights went in.;42.1748232894729;-72.5788369736826
