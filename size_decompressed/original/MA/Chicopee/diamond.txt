I woke up hearing a noise like thunder.  Out of my bedroom window I saw an orange fireball flying by, so I went into the kitchen to look out the window and told my sister to come and see the meteor coming down.  When I opened the curtains my sister and I saw a black diamond-shaped craft hovering over the porch.  It was about ten feet wide and had large green lights on the points of the diamond.  A very low rumbling sound shook the house, the window glass was rattling and the sound seemed to be going through my chest.  We watched it for a few minutes, then the thing slid off the porch roof horizontally, then lifted up and flew away.  It was blacker than the sky, and it seemed to be flying fast and slow at the same time.  Then 4 jets from the Westover Air Force Base chased it but were far too slow to catch up with it. My sister and I started to walk out of the kitchen, but I don't remember going to bed.  I woke up a few hours later, my parents were home and they were yelling at my sister because she was sitting in front of the TV with her eyes bugged out, shaking.  Then I noticed that I was tucked into bed with my slippers on, which I had not been wearing when I got up to look at the object.  My hair was spread out on the pillow and my arms were crossed mummy-style when I woke up.  My door was locked, so my parents had not tucked me in-- and I was too old for that anyway, since I was 14 at the time. The strangest thing is that I never spoke to my sister about this, and I had a false memory of having told my best friend about it.  It was five years before I fully remembered what had happened.;42.1748232894729;-72.5788369736826
Black diamond with green lights lands on porch roof;1980-12-30 23:30:00;5 minutes;Black diamond with green lights lands on porch roof I was sleeping in my room and heard a noise like thunder. I looked out my window and saw an orange fireball gliding over the house.  I went into the kitchen and told my sister to come to the window and watch what I thought was a meteor falling into the back yard.  I pulled open the kitchen curtains and saw a black diamond with green lights on the points settle onto the back porch roof-- but the green lights didn't light up any of the diamond. (It was small, only about ten feet across and about eight feet high.)  A low hum was shaking the house and rattling the back window.  The thing sat on the roof for a few minutes,and I wanted to go outside but I heard someone in my head saying, Don't go outside, you'll get hurt.  Finally the thing slid horizontally off the porch and hovered in the back yard.  The green lights went off and it was just a black diamond, but it was blacker than the sky. It took off and seemed to be flying fast and slow at the same time.  After it had gone over the hill, four jets from the military base chased it, but couldn't catch it.  I don't remember going back to bed, but a few hours later I woke up, tucked into bed, wearing slippers that I hadn't been wearing earlier, and my hands were crossed over my chest.  It took 5 years for me to remember this event, but I had false memories of having told people about it.  When my parents came home that night, they found my sister in front of the TV, shaking.  They thought she'd just seen a scary movie.  She doesn't remember seeing anything that night. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));42.1748232894729;-72.5788369736826

My sister said there was something strange over her house while we were on the phone.  I heard something over my apartment around the same time and looked outside to see a triangular shape (even sided) flying overhead.;42.1748232894729;-72.5788369736826
