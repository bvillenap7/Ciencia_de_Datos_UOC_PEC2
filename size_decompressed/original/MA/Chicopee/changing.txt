Chicopee State Park, Craft seemed to be shooting balls of light or breaking up;1994-10-01 20:00:00;5 minutes;Chicopee State Park, Craft seemed to be shooting balls of light or breaking up Please note time and date are approximate, this happened over ten years ago. Me and 2 other friends where spending the day hiking in the state park, which borders westover AFB. We were making our way out of the park by heading the way of a back trail. There is a large pond/lake in the park with adjacent wall with a railing. We were by the rail enjoying the view of the lake when we saw the forest on the other side of the lake light up very bright (we were about 1/8 mile from object). We saw a round object (it seemed about 75 feet in diameter) that was glowing in multi-color, the object than started to break-up shooting large glowing balls (seemed basketball sized) of light in every direction and color, the glowing balls seemed to be shooting off farther and seemed to be getting closer. We were scared these things might get closer so we proceeded to run as fast as we could into the forest behind us, once we got to the edge of the forest (about 40 yards away)we looked back and there was nothing there. We  continued running anyways until we got to our car. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));42.1748232894729;-72.5788369736826
