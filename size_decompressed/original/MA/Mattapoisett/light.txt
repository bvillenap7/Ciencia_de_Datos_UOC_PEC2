On July 30, 2011 at approximately 9:45 PM in Mattapoisett, MA I noticed a single strange orange light moving slowly through the sky. I noted it as unusual, but only watched it briefly. It was unusual because it was quite constant it did not blink at all like airplanes. It did not look like landing lights from an airplane. It did not move like an airplane or a satellite. Then at approximately 10:30 PM my wife and I both saw three lights identical to the one I had seen earlier. We now paid great attention. I observed them through binoculars, but they still appeared as points of orange light that were not flashing. The three lights were slow moving and slowly moving with respect to one another. I estimated they were over Nantucket Island or even farther away. Then one light quickly, but not instantly, faded away almost as if it were turning and the light no longer was pointed in our direction. Then shortly after that the other two lights did the same and were no longer visible. These were lights like nothing Iâ€™ve ever seen in my 53 years. I have watched many meteor showers and observed many satellites both low orbit, bright, fast moving satellites as well as high orbit, dim, slow moving satellites.;41.6577;-70.8168
Lights in sky over Mattapoisett;2013-09-28 20:00:00;3 minutes;Lights in sky over Mattapoisett I was out walking the dog on my front lawn, and I saw 2, then 3, then 4 slowly moving red/orange lights out over the water.  They were not airplaines, and were silent.  They moved slowly together across the sky, then one got smaller and disappeared, and then they all got smaller and disappeared.  This was nothing like I have ever seen in my 56 years.;41.6577;-70.8168
