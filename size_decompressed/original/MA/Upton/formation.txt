4 lights spreading out from one point, rotating 45 degrees, then meeting again.  ((NUFORC Note:  Advertising lights?  PD));2015-12-25 22:30:00;10 minutes;4 lights spreading out from one point, rotating 45 degrees, then meeting again. The objects were circular lights in the clouds, moving in a set pattern in the sky. They would meet at a point, spread out, rotate 45 degrees, then meet again at the same point as one larger light (continuous cycle) There were 4 lights.  They looked like spotlights.   I was traveling west on I-90 and the formation was traveling roughly the same speed, 70 mph, in the same direction, to the North of my car. In Millbury, the formation slowed down and I lost sight of it.   Wife tried to take video, but the lights were not bright enough to show up. ((NUFORC Note:  Advertising lights?
