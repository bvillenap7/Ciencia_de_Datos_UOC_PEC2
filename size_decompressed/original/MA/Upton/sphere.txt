White sphere, 1 witness, unnatural movement.;2012-09-11 08:50:00;2 minutes approx.;White sphere, 1 witness, unnatural movement. 0850 - My son gets on his bus, bus pulls away, and I happened to look up to see what the air traffic was like on the 09-11 anniversary.  I noticed a white, spherical object moving from the north in a south-south-westerly trajectory at a steady rate of speed, constant altitude.  Would guess it was up at about 2,500/3,000 feet. T + 30 seconds - object still visible, began making a slow turn to the west and then began to move back in my direction to the north/north east.  Noticed a slight haze around the object at this time. Continued to observe object, noticed it was slowly turning more to the east, speed constant.  Hazing only lasted a few seconds, repeated 2 or 3 times. T + 60 seconds - object suddenly moved straight up, covering about 1,000 feet (best guess) in roughly 2 seconds.  Object stayed in place for another few seconds, and then began slowly moving back in a south-south-westerly trajectory at this new altitude.  Watched object for another 30 seconds or so until I could no longer perceive it.;42.1753;-71.6017
