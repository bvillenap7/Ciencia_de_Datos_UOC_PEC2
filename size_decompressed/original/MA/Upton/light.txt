My boyfriend and I were driving down Rte 140 leaving Grafton heading to Upton.   We had lost power earlier that night and the wind and rain had been pretty bad.  The sky had cleared up by this time and there were many stars visible in the sky.   I was looking in the sky as I always do and noticed what looked to be 3 BRIGHT lights moving slowly just above the trees, very low,  I told my boyfriend to look at this because I did not think it resembled any type of plane.  He did not see it because as we continued driving it disappeared behind the tree line.   About a mile further down the road I observed this object in the sky again, it was very low and almost right overhead.  I pulled the car over to observe and show my boyfriend.  It had about three large yellow/white lights that were extreamly bright (hurt your eyes to look at)  and a few other smaller, dimmer lights that were blue and red it didnt even really seem to be moving much if it was it was Very slow.   We sat there observing for about 5 minutes trying to figure out what this could be.   Then the lights just like shut off, it just disappeared, nowhere to be seen. we then just drove home, rubbing and blinking our eyes because of the extremely bright lights we observed.;42.1753;-71.6017
