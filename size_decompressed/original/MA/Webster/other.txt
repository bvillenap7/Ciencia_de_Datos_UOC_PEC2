Lake side beach. Webster mass;1981-06-30 00:00:00;02:00;Lake side beach. Webster mass I think it was 1981 but not sure.  Was many years later that this sighting started bothering me.  I remember seeing a sled like thing in the sky not very high at the lake side beach area off of lower gore Rd Webster lake.  There were different color lights maybe blue red white.  The strange thing is it's bothered me for over 30 years with no explanation. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));42.0521000000001;-71.8486
