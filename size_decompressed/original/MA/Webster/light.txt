4 glowing orange UFOs seen in Webster, MA;2011-10-23 00:20:00;3 minutes each;4 glowing orange UFOs seen in Webster, MA I saw a post on a social media page from a friend claiming, I think I just saw a UFO over Webster Lake. I live close to Webster Lake so out of curiosity a friend and I looked out the window. Immediately upon looking out the window we saw 2 glowing orange spheres traveling in a south/south east direction.  One of the UFOs was slightly above and to the right of the other. I ran outside and could still see the objects clearly, as did my friend.  At this point our two girlfriends were also looking out the window from the inside, seeing exactly the same thing.  After roughly 30 seconds the first, higher in the sky and to the right, object began to disappear. I would describe the disappearance of the UFO's as a very drastic fade.  The objects were extremely bright one moment, and once they began to fade, within 1-2 seconds the object was comletely gone.  Seconds after, the second disappeared. After 5 to 6 minutes two more crafts appeared from a more northerly positio! n.(UFOS 3 and 4) These UFOs were in the same formation. With one slightly above and to the right.  The bottom/left UFO disappeared after roughly 10 seconds, but the 4th UFO stayed glowing orange for a full minute.  This 4th UFO was traveling south and was clearly gradually rising in the sky.;42.0521000000001;-71.8486
