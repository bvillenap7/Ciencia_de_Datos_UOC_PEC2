Orange colored sphere stationary, very low over lake, accelerates fast, high and away as approached;2011-10-22 20:45:00;5 min;Orange colored sphere stationary, very low over lake, accelerates fast, high and away as approached At the time specified, my girlfriend and I saw an orange flickering sphere hovering 75-150 ft over Webster Lake (stationary). We were in the car. It was an unlit highway.  I  rolled down my window and it remained still.  We drove closer after turning around getting off the interstate to investigate.  This took about 4 minutes. I thought sure it would be gone. It remained and as I approached (500 yards away now), the sphere, very smoothly accelerated upward and away fading into the north east sky.  I am an Aviation professional and cannot compare color, acceleration, or rate of climb to that of anything I have ever seen.
