5 Bright Light Orbs in Webster, MA.;2014-09-16 19:00:00;10-15 seconds;5 Bright Light Orbs in Webster, MA. When my iphone warned me for low battery, I had to get plug from the car.  I wish I bring iphone with me, but it is just happened (too late)  I went outside and looked at the sky, I noticed lights, I thought it was a plane but the way it looks didn't make any sense to me.  It does not match any aircrafts I know.   I had to see/study those lights until it went down below the tree line.  It was 5 bright light orbs, not like plane light.  That is different.  The dots were in group flying toward East.  I was looking at East.  The color of lights are white-yellow.  It was short sighting.;42.0521000000001;-71.8486
