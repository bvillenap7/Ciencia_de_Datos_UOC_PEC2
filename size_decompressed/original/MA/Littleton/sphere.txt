Silver White  radiant Pulsating Sphere Streaks & stops in Sky 8/24/03 3:15 PM  Littleton Mass.;2003-08-24 15:15:00;1minute 30 seconds;Silver White  radiant Pulsating Sphere Streaks & stops in Sky 8/24/03 3:15 PM  Littleton Mass. At 3:15 PM at the Kimball Ice Cream driving range, route 110 Littleton Massachusetts  husband/wife and two adjacent golfers witnessed a silver white/pulsating radiant sphereical light streaking at a very high rate of speed across the sky in a westerly direction aproximately 30,000 or more feet up in the sky.  We observed this for about 30 seconds or so....then the object came to a fast stop....hovered for about 20-30 seconds and continued to pulsate as described above...it then moved slightly east...then began to go south and eventually faded into the horizon..total length of sighting was about 1 and 1/2 minutes...2 commercial jets in the area with 2 trailing contrails were easily recognizable, another jet traveling east was easily recognizable and did not experience any sun refelction on  its hull...these jets were NOT traveling as fast as the pulsating sphere...it was TOO HIGH in the sky and to fast to be a helicopter...and stopped to fast to be either a helicopter or a jet.  It was NOT Mars, NOT Venus...planets do not move fast across the sky at 3:15 in the afternoon...There was no sound. Visibility was UNLIMITED...no clouds...perfect summer day.  Husband is an electrical engineer and physics person/wife is educated business woman...we used to live near Logan Airport in  Boston and have been at lots of airports all hours of the day and night...THIS WAS NOT an airplane as we are familiar with...this was something DIFFERENT...note should be taken tthat Hanscom Base is in the vicinity with 15 miles or so of  sighting. We felt like once we started talking about the orb...was when it stopped...like it turned and looked at us or something....we saw this as well as a couple of other people.
