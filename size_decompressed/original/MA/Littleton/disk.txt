Faint disk travelling parallel to I495 southbound in Littleton MA.;1998-12-14 21:05:00;1 second;Faint disk travelling parallel to I495 southbound in Littleton MA. I was driving south on I495 (in Littleton?) 10 to 15 minutes south of junction with Route 4 in Chelmsford MA. I saw an object come into view at my right through the top center of my windshield travelling approximately the same direction as me but faster. It dissappeared behind hills or trees on the right side of the road. It was visible for less than one second. It appeared round, but this was difficult to judge. It very dim, not much brighter than the night sky. I saw no running lights. When I reached my destination I tried to simulate what I saw by reflecting light from my flashlight in my windshield. I wasn't able to do this without also creating other bright spots inside the passenger compartment which I would have noticed.;42.5374;-71.4842
