Suffice to say that myself and six others, (five of whom I did not meet until the sighting), witnessed an enormous sized triangular craft moving south to north in western Massachusetts near the New York State border.  I discovered several weeks later that the same object was sighted in the Hudson Valley in New York and in White Plains and Brewster.   Am not certain of the exact date this occured but for some strange reason I have been doing a little research trying to pinpoint the exact evening.  I do remember that either the next day or a few days after the sighting that a group of light planes flew over parts of Eastern New York in a triangular pattern in an  effort to explain the sighting to the public.  Anyone who had seen the triangular craft, and I have discovered there were literally hundreds, and then saw the planes flying in the formation the next evening would have to be a fool to believe they were one and the same.  I was 35 at the time of the sighting.  The thought never goes away.  You may want to think twice before you wish you could see a UFO.
