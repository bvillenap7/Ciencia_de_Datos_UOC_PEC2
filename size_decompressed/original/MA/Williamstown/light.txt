2 unblinking star-like objects moving quickly across the sky.   ((NUFORC Note:  ISS in formation with Space Shuttle??

My boyfriend and I were sitting in my back yard when my boyfriend noticed 2 bright star-like objects moving quite fast across the sky.  They were silent unblinking lights and appeared to be at a very high altitude.  1 light followed the other (maybe several hundred feet apart), one behind the other.  The distance between them or speed never varied...they were perfectly aligned and travelling in a West to East direction.  After watching them travel across the sky for approximately 1 to 2 minutes, the first light dimmed and disappeared and a moment later the second light completely vanished.  It was a clear night with very little cloud cover.  It was a little unsettling because neither of us could think of a rational explanation for what it could have been.  Very strange!
