Hovering.  Top of object was orange donut shape with a triangular white spike below.  Daytime. Driving east across Petersburg Pass on Route 2, 100 yards past the Mass border with NY. Hovering on the west side of the road about 200 feet high, above a heavily forested area, was an object I could not identify.  The top section of the object was a bright red/orange donut shape about 3-5 feet around.   Below the donut, a 5-10 foot long white pyramidal spike shape pointed at the ground.  The spike had either 3 or 4 sides I could not tell for sure.  I observed it for about 3 to 5 seconds before our car went past it and we went around a turn.  At the first opportunity, I turned around a few hundred yards further in a parking area and went back up toward the top of the pass to try to see it again.  However, it was no longer visible.;42.7087;-73.1987
