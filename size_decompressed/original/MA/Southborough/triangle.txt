I was going to wait for the vehicle to pass and then pull out behind it into traffic.  It took longer than expected to get past me so I went to look up again and that’s when I realized it wasn’t what I’d expected to be looking at.  It appeared to be about the size of 2 large pickup trucks in length, triangular shaped with 3 bright lights emitting to the front of the vehicle and it was a color best described as a darker-tint stainless steel.  There was 1 light on each side and one in the middle of the front.  It was approximately 2 to 2.5 inches in height (thickness) and was approximately 5 feet off of the roadway moving slower than the speed limit which was 35mph.  Very shortly after passing in front of me it completely disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));42.2924;-71.5275
