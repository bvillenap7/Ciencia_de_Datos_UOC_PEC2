The craft was extremely large.  Triple the size of a large home and only several hundred feet above the treeline.  It slowly hovered closer with lights pulsating and as our motion lights in driveway went off it disappeared.  Didn't fly off, but was suddenly gone.  This craft was completely silent.  Never a sound .;42.2377;-71.9206
5 lights forming a triangle.;2019-09-19 21:45:00;5 minutes;5 lights forming a triangle. Tonight I was driving on Stafford street towards Leicester.  There were 5, very bright lights that seemed to be from different crafts.  Altogether, they formed a triangle shape.  They just hovered in the sky together. I had to take a right at the intersection so I drove away from the lights.  I could no longer see them.  It was very weird and different.  As soon as I saw it, my body got numb and i got goosebumps, probably because I was scared.   Iâ€™m wondering if anyone else saw it.;42.2377;-71.9206
