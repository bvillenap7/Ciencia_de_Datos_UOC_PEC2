Flash of light, then object moving fast across the night sky.;2018-04-22 11:00:00;10 seconds;Flash of light, then object moving fast across the night sky. I was sitting outside smoking a cigarette before bed looking up at the bright moon when I saw a flash in the sky, as if a star turned on and off.  I didn't think anything of it when a few minutes later from the opposite side of the sky I saw a fast moving brightly glowing white/reddish object trail accross the sky for about 10 seconds, and then disappear.  It was moving much faster than an airplane but much slower than a shooting star.  And I know that it couldn't have been a shooting star because this object was moving horizontally along the skyline.  The odd thing was that it disappeared right around where I saw the initial flash.  There was no sound that I could hear at the time but there was a loud bang in the distance.  Not sure if it could be related to this object.  It was a very quiet night before this, but shortly after 3 aircraft emerged from the sky which I thought was odd.  And all the dogs in the surrounding areas started barking.;42.2377;-71.9206
