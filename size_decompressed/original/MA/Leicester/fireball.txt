Bright spot of light falling from the sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Reported as a meteor.  PD));2016-05-17 01:00:00;5 minutes;bright spot of light falling from the sky Don't think it was a UFO.   I work nights and was opening up my building walked back outside to grab my lunch from my truck.  Then I saw it the sky turned a reddish color and bright ball of light fell straight down, sky then turned light blue color and when the ball fell out of site.  Sky turned back to black like it should look at night.  I was expecting a explosion I thought it was a plane falling from the sky.  I've never seen anything like that it was so unreal. ((NUFORC Note:  We have received several other reports from the east coast of the event.  We suspect that the most likely explanation is a dramatic meteor.
