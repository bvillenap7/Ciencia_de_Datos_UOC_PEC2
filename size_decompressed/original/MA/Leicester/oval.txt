Oval craft glowing green;2007-02-07 03:30:00;15 minutes;Oval craft glowing green It was about 3:30 in the morning and a strange noise suddenly awoke me.  I looked out the window and saw that my motion-detector light was on.  I went downstairs thinking to see a deer or sasquatch, but there was nothing there.  I looked up and saw a bizarre oval shaped craft that seemed to be moving east/west very quickly.  At first I ruled it out as being a UFO since I am very close to the airport, thinking it was a plane.  But I have never seen an oval shaped plane before.  The craft continued to move back and forth east/west when it began to glow a mysterious green color.  Suddenly, the craft took off to the north and was gone.  It must have been going hundreds of miles per hour because it was gone in the blink of an eye.  I don't know what it was but it was not a plane or a helicopter.  I did not see any aliens or things like that, only the craft.  I will look for it again tonight.  I will see if I can flag the craft down to land in my yard so that I can befriend our outer-space allies..;42.2377;-71.9206
