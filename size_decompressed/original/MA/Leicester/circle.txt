Last week, I saw something that flew at the blink of an eye. It looked weird but I didn't put much thought into it because I thought it was just a shooting star. Last night, I saw it again on the same spot.  This had me thinking.  This craft looked like a bright star that was still in the sky.  Out of no where, it flew away so quick.  Like a zap or something.  This object had a tail of light facing the direction it was heading, so the light was in front of the craft.  When looking at a shooting star, the tail of light is behind the star, facing the opposite direction of where it's heading. It was so weird, this thing past so quick, like at the blink of an eye and then disappeared.  I have never seen anything like this in my life.  I don't know how to explain this.;42.2377;-71.9206
