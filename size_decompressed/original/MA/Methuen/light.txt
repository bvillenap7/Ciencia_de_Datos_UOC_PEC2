Yellow/orange light over route 93 near Methuen.;2013-12-24 16:30:00;20 seconds;Yellow/orange light over route 93 near Methuen While traveling north on rt 93 two of us saw a yellow/orange light heading in a southern direction.  There were planes off in the distance to the west which had the tell tale blinking lights.  This light was like the color of a dim headlight bulb on an old car.  It was low in altitude and had no other colors with it.  We lost sight of it after passed over the truck and was out of my sight path.  We watched it for about 15 seconds.  It was a different color than anything else in the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));42.7287000000001;-71.1833999999999
Four bluish-white lights (possibly saucers) + one upside-down teardrop ship over i93 and own home, Methuen, MA, 01844;2016-11-17 21:30:00;6 hours;Four bluish-white lights (possibly saucers) + one upside-down teardrop ship over i93 and own home, Methuen, MA, 01844 I was coming down the highway (specifically i93 North) and right near exit 46-47, I noticed a few lights in the sky, towards the southwest, much closer to earth compared to the surrounding stars, (I verified this later on, viewing the lights through my binoculars from my kitchen window) and I knew something was different because the stars were so dim, and these lights were so bright, and one of these lights even had a diamond shape to it, with a vertical light coming down from the main point of horizontal light on the top.  (the best description I have for this shape are those concept photos of what cloud cities would look like on Venus)  I felt a drop in my stomach because at first, I honestly thought it was an incoming meteor and even swerved my car out of shock from these lights.  They were clearly spinning and blinking blue and white lights, and the other few objects, other than the cloud city-looking one, almost had a saucer shape to them when I looked through binoculars when I arrived home.  (which these lights were totally visible the entire night, from the highway and then from my home in Methuen as well) I grabbed my iPhone and started recording when I got home, and when I was watching the video I took from my street, you can't see much, but you can tell that although the lights were stationary, they were clearly moving and hovering, and you can even see the succession of colors it was giving off.  Now at first, I thought these may have been drones, but I witnessed them stay aligned in a swooping line under the moon and continue to blink and hover in the same exact position until 3:30am the following morning! I had my father verify that these lights were indeed there and that I was not crazy for thinking there were strange lights locked in with the moon's path across the night sky. He isn't a believer either, but he was stumped by what we were witnessing, and even took a few looks through the binoculars to make sure they w! ere really there hovering!  What's even more interesting, is that two n ights later, when the clouds broke for a few at night, I could see the possibly saucer-shaped, blue and white flashing light again, in the same exact position, not moving but clearly hovering and spinning!  I have been doing some research, and the only possible report of UFOs that matched my description, were seen traversing in front of the sun and interacting with said star two days before I saw what I saw they were blue and white orbs and they were witnessed possibly taking energy from our sun, and I am starting to wonder if what I saw was maybe one of these orbs, much smaller, viewing the Earth and keeping a close eye as there mothership interacts with our sun (maybe to prevent the earthlings from acting on this giant object near our sun!) who knows, I just know what I saw and I will try to figure out a way to post the videos I have, zoomed in and more focused on the objects.;42.7287000000001;-71.1833999999999

I heard a small noise but once it disappeared I didn’t see it again. It was followed by another light the same thing and it faded a little earlier it took about 10 seconds for the fading to complete.;42.7287000000001;-71.1833999999999
