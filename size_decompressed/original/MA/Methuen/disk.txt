It was rotating At 9:46 P.M my son my girlfriend and myself were getting in our car when a big disc with a red light came flying over head. It was moving at a much higher rate than the planes. It was not going in straight line i could see it rotating with the naked eye. There was 4 orange lights that followed it.  About 20 seconds apart from each other. They resembled hope candles.  The thing with that is they weren't going up into the sky. They were flying just as fast as the disc. they all vanished around the same point in the sky;42.7287000000001;-71.1833999999999
