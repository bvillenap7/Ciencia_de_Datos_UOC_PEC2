At first I thought it was a balloon bieng launched from a local buisness. As this mass went up I realized it was changing shape and a slight changing of color.  I followed it up and then it started moving over my head pretty high in the sky. I followed it until it went over my sister in laws house and I couldnt see it anymore. I was about to go inside and then I saw 3 lights chasing it. These lights seemed extremely high and moving extremely fast. They looked like stars they were so high. They followed the shape changing objects exact path.  The original object is hard to explain. I can only explain it as cloud like or gas like with a self emitting light? It seemed to change shape and color. It started low to the ground and rose slowly. I have never seen anything like it before.  I called my local Police but no one else has reported anything.;42.7287000000001;-71.1833999999999
