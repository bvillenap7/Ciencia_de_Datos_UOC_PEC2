I went to see  what she was barking at , I looked out the window at the street below  as I thought maybe she's barking at person or an animal but there was nothing as I started to turn my head Inoticed some odd lights in the sky  there  were 3 with triangle pattern red ,and  green lights that would  flash . I first thought maybe they were military helicopters but they didnt make any noise they would dart around strangely  and then after watching them for about 2-3 minutes there was a white flash  ball shape that came over the tree tops and then left straight up and north, then the red flashing light objects dispersed in a crazy criss cross  pattern and then  appeared to chase after white ball of light .then they were gone in a second,  So I dont know what I saw, but it was not like anything i've seen before. Is the military testing new aircraft?  it was too fast and quiet.   Would like to know if anyone else noticed the lights.  I told my husband and my son. but the objects never came back we watched the sky for about 20minutes then went to bed..;42.7287000000001;-71.1833999999999
Strange orange triangular objects.;2015-06-13 20:40:00;20 minutes;Strange orange triangular objects. I was inside my car with my wife, when she told me to look up for what she thought to be 3 airplanes flying really close from each other,  the problem is that these did not look like airplanes the light these objects were reflecting was of orange tone and they have triangle shape forms.   There were 3 flying objects, one on front two behind one at each side, one disappear two keep flying next to the other, when these two were far from the point where the third object disappear this third object show up again.;42.7287000000001;-71.1833999999999
