large bright lighted object seen in sky on 495 in methuen/haverhill line...any other witnesses????;2007-06-05 02:42:00;0.2;large bright lighted object seen in sky on 495 in methuen/haverhill line...any other witnesses???? We were driving home on 495 north after just getting off 213, and in our sky far ahead to the left above the tree line we both saw an object with two rectengular lights on it side by side.  It seemed like a flat object and seemed something like a frisbee but like advanced like batplane.  It was cloudy but the object was clear as day and vanished almost immediately we witnessed it.  At first we didn't say anything to eachother becuase we were both kind of shocked at what we had witnessed.  It seemed like it just appeared far ahead of us and then darted downward and vanished from our view.  The driver thought it looked as if it had been shot down.;42.7287000000001;-71.1833999999999
Eleven bright, orange colored orbs. First four in a formation type pattern, the next seven in a straight line.;2013-12-19 18:30:00;5 minutes;Eleven bright, orange colored orbs. First four in a formation type pattern, the next seven in a straight line. All objects were sphere shaped, orange in color.   First two objects were side by side with a small space in between, the next two objects were following close behind and spread a little wider.  These objects were in a formation pattern. As they passed, they faded slowly one by one.  There was a slight gap and then the fifth orb appeared and (was following in the same path as the first four).   Followed by the seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, and eleventh orb.  These latter orbs were in a straight line formation.  They would start bright far away and as they neared, they would fade.   The night was clear and moon/stars were visible. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));42.7287000000001;-71.1833999999999
Two basket ball type orange/yellow sheres traveling east past a half moon.;2014-05-09 21:35:00;10 seconds;Two basket ball type orange/yellow sheres traveling east past a half moon. I was sitting out back on my porch smoking. I was looking straight ahead dragging on my cigarette when out of the corner of my eye in the direction of a half moon, light caught my eye, (sky lit up).  I looked up to the half moon and observed 2 basket ball sized objects flying on my side of the moon. The objects were yellow/orange in color. I could not believe my eyes. I jumped off the chair and turned to run into my house to get my girlfriend, who just went to bed.  I stopped and told myself that it couldn't be.  Let me look again to verify.  I looked again and there they were traveling east.  I estimated the speed and thought I would have a few seconds to get ((girl's name deleted)).  I wanted her witness an event of a lifetime. I ran about 20 feet from the porch to the bedroom and yelled get out here! I then ran back to hope it was still there.  They were gone.  I ran down to the driveway to look on the other side of the house,nothing. I wish I would have stayed now. I was so excited.  The event was so unbelievable. The 2 objects were moving like they were floating effortlessly, but were travelling in an eastward direction at a good speed.  From my sight they were basket ball sized, about 1/4 size of the half moon. They seem to just appear in that location and were 2 separate objects one behind the other. I made sure I was seeing what I was, by taking that second look.  I first thought when I looked away, that I better check in case I was seeing something not there.  When I saw them again, I was so excited at what I was witnessing.  Unbelievable. The night was clear in the spot I was looking (south west), with broken clouds to the west.  About 60 degrees.  I can't help this feeling I had: when planes go by in the sky, they appear to be working hard to maintain flight.  These things were so different.  You get that distinct feeling that they are floating effortlessly, although traveling fast, interesting. I am a little embarrassed as, I reported an event that happened in 1988 on May 8, 201, to this website and this happened the next day.  I find that a little odd myself.;42.7287000000001;-71.1833999999999
