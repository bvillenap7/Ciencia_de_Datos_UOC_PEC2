Two white cigar shaped ufos cross over methuen;2017-07-16 20:07:00;10 minutes;Two white cigar shaped ufos cross over methuen Me and by boyfriend, who had come back to my hometown from college, were going out for ice cream, when we saw two bright white cigar shaped objects hovering around each other, going from the southern horizon to the northern horizon, ducking behind clouds.  This is like the fifth time I'm filling out this report because my phone keeps shutting off whenever I finish writing the report (coincidence? Maybe)   After we noticed the strange flying objects and they had gone, we saw two grey small planes flying around the area.   A few years ago I saw about thirty of the same exact ufos going the same way a few at a time ducking behind clouds.  This is why I noticed them and knew what they were so abruptly.  The first time I saw them, about ten others in my neighborhood did, as well.  (flying from Lowell street in Methuen to Forest Street/the Methuen water tower);42.7287000000001;-71.1833999999999
