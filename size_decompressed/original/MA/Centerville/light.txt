Bright round object;2009-09-01 05:13:00;20 seconds;Bright round object I was doing some star gazing and viewing venus and saw a bright light appear in the western sky. The object appeared to be under 8 thousand feet in altitude and moving in a steady motion from west to east and eventually dissapearing off in the distance. The object was about 2 times the brightness as venus and had a warm orange glow to it. I watched the object for about 20-25 secs before it was gone.;41.6646;-70.3452

The line elongated, and then split into 2 sections.     Conjecture--it could have been a satellite, burning up on re-entry, or some other object.    Light was clearly white and straight.   The leading edge was heading toward the ground, perhaps close to Otis AFB?  However, clouds obscured the final period of the event.;41.6646;-70.3452
