Small orange shooting metior travelling Northeast direction direction.  ((anonymous report))((NUFORC Note:  Meteor??  PD));2018-04-21 22:30:00;2-3 seconds;Small orange shooting metior travelling Northeast direction direction. I happened to look out at the night sky and to check the weather and was looking at Venus and Mars and saw an orange fireball going from South to Northeast at a very fast rate. I have seen two other larger meteors before but never reported them.  This one was smaller and was spitting sparks and a small trail. I was wondering if anyone else witnessed the same thing?
