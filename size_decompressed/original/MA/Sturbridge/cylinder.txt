I'm a 17  year old kid with fairly ok grades and who is much more itelegent then they reflecf. I have always seen stuff through teloscopes, and i have always looked at the skys. I have always told people what they see if a airplane, or a planet or stars. But every once in a while i see something i can't explain. Like January 6 2007. I never said anything on this site because i just found it today. On this day in question i saw a flying object about afew hundred feet in the sky. It was round and seemed to be bigger then a plane, had red and purple lights, and it seemed to be giving or something because i got a headach looking at it. I watched it go back and froth in the sky(like it was looking for something) for 15-20minutes. I was amazed.  Finally after that time it shot up into the atospehere out of site in seconds. . . Explain that as a aircarft and I'll call you as liar because not even i could explain it. ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  PD));42.1158;-72.0871000000001
