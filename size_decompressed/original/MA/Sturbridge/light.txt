For years I have observed this object(s) in the night sky on the horizon. I have a few acres and no trees blocking the night sky.  I usually see this bright, glowing round object close to the horizon in any direction on any given night. The object will be very bright, then more dull.. move in one direction, then back the other way go up and then descend below the horizon.  It seems to be very bright when going back upward. When the object is close, but never overhead..it is silent.  No noise is heard in the sky.  Sometimes, there are multiple objects at once, usually one or more coming upward while one is in the sky just sitting there.  No distinct colors. I have been unsuccessful in photographing them so far. Working on my night camera skills.;42.1158;-72.0871000000001
Very large bright light in the sky, similar to a helicopter light but bigger. Darted behind clouds, didnt see it again after that;2017-10-25 18:10:00;45 seconds;Very large bright light in the sky, similar to a helicopter light but bigger.
