Fireball  possible abductee tests done? took me 27 years to come to terms!!;1978-06-30 01:00:00;not sure;Fireball  possible abductee tests done? took me 27 years to come to terms!! I was 13 and it has taken me tillnow. I am currently taking a Ufology course (going for diploma in Paranormal studies, PhD.in Metaphysical Sciences) actually I felt drawn too and this is why.....I am some friends were camping out by the cranberry bogs it was late and we were very tired just after we made sure the fire was out and saying our good nights I for some reason looked up and saw what looked like a red, glowing orb shaped thing just above the tree line, now when I say trees I mean the 40 to 60 foot pine trees common in New England. I thought it was a fireball although there was no lightening around but it was misty...however this fireball was not on a straight line path it seemed to dance along the tree line changing direction cleanly and swiftly. Well needless to say the rest of my gruop too had joined me in awe staring at this phenomenon, we had to staring at this for quite a while not realizing the amount of time that had passed...it had to have been a very long whilre because when we came to so to speak a very dense fog had settled in and we could barely make out each others outline  even though we were within a few feet if not inches from each other. This is the thing for years after I have nothing but problem pregnancies, one miscarriage after another, the Doctors all say it is because of extensive scaring in my tubes and on my uterus, that they could not explain. I have had no dreams or proof of an abduction but feel Iit would explain the scarring...please tell me I am not crazy !!   Also there are other things about my skeletal structure that put me in the Medical books in Pa. They had found extensions if you like on both my shoulder blades that resemble that of a birds there are 5 on each and extend only far enough to be visible in an MRI, the doc jokingly said it looked like I either did or was suppossed to have wings. Not sure if these two things are related but one never knows!! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));41.6446547008547;-70.9332888888888
On Sunday night, October 9, 2011 we saw many fireballs fly over New Bedford, MA.;2011-10-09 18:42:00;28 Minutes;On Sunday night, October 9, 2011 we saw many fireballs fly over New Bedford, MA. It was an unusually warm night with very clear skies. At 7:42 PM, my son was driving near a local Park when he saw five fireballs in the night sky.  The fireballs displayed complex patterns of symmetrical movement.   He immediately phoned me and we went out into the street to observe it and saw that the objects were flying over our house in single file and they made no sound.  A new fireball would appear just over the Western horizon about every 30 seconds.  They traveled on the same basic path from West to East.   Each appeared as an orange and red fireball.   The fireballs were about 4 times the size of Jupiter.  They moved past us and onto a point just above the eastern horizon where groups of two or three of them would congregate and then disappear together as a group.   One of the fireballs changed color to white and merged with an orange one at their meeting point.  The last ship disappeared at about 8:10 PM.  We did not get a picture or a video, but we have since found many videos and pictures of these same objects posted on the internet. ((NUFORC Note:  We have corrected the date above, to reflect a sighting in October, not November, 2011.  PD));41.6446547008547;-70.9332888888888
Nine orange glowing fireballs Court St west end New Bedford Ma heading southeast about 8 PM.;2011-10-09 20:00:00;10 minutes;Nine orange glowing fireballs Court St west end New Bedford Ma heading southeast about 8 PM. My two daughters and I where walking the dog on Florence street heading south towards Court street when approaching the corner my older daughter seen the first orange ball.  Then another two followed it they seem to glow but also looked like a balls of fire.  They seemed to move quickly but where silent and it was hard to judge the height.  I told my girls to let's go around the corner to get a better look as we turned the corner we watched them go southeast towards St Lukes hospital.  My daughter then said look daddy theres more, which was another three that travelled the same route but seemed a little lower. We are now walking down Court street which is a oneway heading east we watched them as we walked about three blocks we seen the last three come over the house behind us again going the same direction.  As we walked another block we seen a lady walking on James St turning on Court and I asked if she seen the lights she said yes.  My youngest daughter was cry! ing about she was scared of the fire.  The four of us seen a couple on a porch on Court between James and Tremont he was recording the last ones  we seen which actually looked like they moved together as one.  Then when we got closer to the house we seen a group of teenagers 6 of them or so who said they had seen them also.  I tried to take two videos only one could you see a little but it's only a two megapixel phone camera. I would like to know if anyone could explain these.  Thank you.;41.6446547008547;-70.9332888888888
I was driving home on the highway and I always have eyes in the sky while driving.(not my first sighting) As I came off 195;2014-06-14 23:17:00;2 minutes;I was driving home on the highway and I always have eyes in the sky while driving.(not my first sighting) As I came off 195 I was driving home on the highway and I always haveeyes in the sky while driving.  (not my first sighting)   As I came off 195 an orange light caught my eye.as I looked closer I noticed there were several flying objects.  I noticed that they were not airplanes they were not stars, and definitely not a fire lantern.   So, I wanted to get a video this time, I pulled over and grabbed my cell, and I was so excited, I wasn't even fully pulled off to the side of the highway in the breakdown lane.   So I fixed my self all while filming.  These UFO's weren't just fire balls I could notice shape and dimension inside the light like a craft and I saw shadows in the middle of these crafts.  There wernt any trail that I could see behind them.  They were pretty close to one another all going more or less in the same direction.  I wanted to stay and watch, but I didn't want to get hit, or a cop drive by.   So I decided to get off the highway and try to find a better view.  But I lost them.I did capture some video but it's very hard to see it in the video compared to in real life.  The ufo's were pretty close to the ground, as if they were looking for something. Last year near this area back in August, I encountered UFOs, they were fireballs but they were very different.;41.6446547008547;-70.9332888888888
