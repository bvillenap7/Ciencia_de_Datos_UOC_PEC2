I saw a small metalic silver sphere at 3200 feet.;2015-04-19 14:10:00;10 seconds;I saw a small mettalic silver sphere at 3200 feet. 4/23/2015   To whom it may concern:   On April 19, 2015, my wife and I, along with our two young grandchildren, were flying home in our personal aircraft from Marthaâ€™s Vineyard to our home airport, between New Bedford, MA, and Lincoln, RI, at 3200 MSL.   I witnessed a small round object about 150 feet higher than our plane and about 50 feet beyond our left wing.  The time was 2:10 local. The round object appeared to be approximately between two and three feet in diameter, from that distance.  It was silver metallic in color.   I do not know if the object was stationary or moving but it passed to our left side of our plane. The report was reported to Providence air traffic control.   The sighting was no longer than 10 seconds.;41.6446547008547;-70.9332888888888

Four spherical objects emitting red aura flying in a trail formation;2019-11-25 18:45:00;7 minutes;Four spherical objects emitting red aura flying in a trail formation I saw four spherical objects in the sky near the intersection of Route 140 and Route 6 at approximately 700-1500 feet. Two of them were headed west to east over Route 140 parallel with one another. One of them then moved behind the other in a trailing formation moving at approximately 20+ mph. The other two objects I observed were located above a cemetery near Route 140 and Route 6. They were moving up, down, left, right for a minute or so. One of them dropped altitude really quickly like, 500 feet in less than a second. It then moved back upwards and the both started heading west to east in a trailing formation back over Route 140 and Route 6. Could have been drones, color being emitted was a red solid light with an aura around it.;41.6446547008547;-70.9332888888888
