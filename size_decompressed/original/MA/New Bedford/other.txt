strange craft, erratic movement, no blinking lights or sound;1982-06-15 21:00:00;10 min.;strange craft, erratic movement, no blinking lights or sound I had returned home from a school event.  I looked up and thought that I initially was seeing an aircraft coming in for a landing...not unusual, as I lived about 1 mile from New Bedford airport. The only reason that I continued to look for any length of time were (1) the craft was stopped...(2) no noise   (3) no blinking lights.  (4) strange appearance.  All of those quickly ruled out a chopper or plane, and every second the object seemed stranger.   As I watched, the shape was hard to determine but appeared somewhat triangular...there were lights, but they were just hues, no blinking.  There was no sound at all.  Craft made some sudden  nervous type moves, all followed by complete and sudden stops, which startled me.  It then slowly hovered across the highway, with a few complete stops,  then was completely stopped above the treeline in a non-occupied wooded area behind my home (I rented an attached apartment).  I ran and knocked on my landlord's door, but they were not in, and unfortunately I did not have any camera film.  The craft then went down behind the tree line in the wooded area.  I was shaken.  I was a school teacher (and still am)  I only told my parents and one other teacher in the area, and some close friends not from the area.  I overheard a student talking to another the next morning, stating he had seen something out near the New Bedford airport at appx. the same time...strikingly similar.  I did not talk to the student.  Another friend spoke to someone on an airplane from Boston a month later, a salesman, who suddenly spoke of seeing something weird recently....when asked where, he replied New Bedford Mass, along the highway and close to the airport.  I had never seen anything like this before, or since. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));41.6446547008547;-70.9332888888888
