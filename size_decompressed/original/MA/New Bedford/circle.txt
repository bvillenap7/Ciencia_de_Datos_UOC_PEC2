Circle shaped craft over new bedford, MA 12 lights lite up around it and 2 blinking ones on top.;2006-12-18 18:00:00;5 min +;Circle shaped craft over new bedford, MA 12 lights lite up around it and 2 blinking ones on top. It was night time, but it light up the sky it had lights all around it and 2 on top that blinked white about 12 lights lite up all around the craft as it looked like it was getting ready to take off I was able to see the craft because of how it lite up the night sky, I belive the color of the craft was a smoke grey. This happened near Rockdale west over the woods near the tall flag pole about 50yds from it. I was skeptical at 1st about UFOs till I witnessed 2 in one week. The 2nd one happen only about 5 days before. The craft looked like a jet so at 1st thats what I thought it was however it wasn't. The craft had thrusters it looked like on each side front and back of the craft it was grey and silver and left no trail what so ever then all of a sudden it was gone in a blink of an eye The one happened over my house very high in the air. Unfortunatly I have no pictures or video but I know what I seen those days and I hope one day there will be some light shedded on these events and the goverment to acknowledge this to the public.

We saw many orange fireballs fly over New Bedford, MA.;2011-10-09 19:42:00;28 minutes;We saw many orange fireballs fly over New Bedford, MA. It was an unusually warm night with very clear skies.  At 7:42 PM, my son was driving his car near Buttonwood Park, in the City’s West End, when he saw five bright orange fireballs in the night sky.  The fireballs seemed to be playing tag with each other, and their movement formed symmetrical patterns.  He phoned us about it so we went outside to check them out. Once in the street, we immediately saw the objects flying over the house in single file, and they made no sound. Every 30-seconds or so, a new fireball would appear just over the Western horizon.  It followed the same path in the sky as if in a procession.  Our son arrived at the house and the three of us continued to watch from the street. The fireballs were orange and red on the outside and using binoculars, the center looked bright white. To the naked eye, the fireballs appeared to be about two to three times the size of Jupiter.  Jupiter gives the appearance of a big bright star, and is currently the largest object in night sky beside the moon.  I would guess that the objects were flying well above the stratosphere at tremendous speed as they covered half the sky in about 30-seconds!   The fireballs moved past us and onto a point just above the Eastern horizon where they would congregate in groups of three.  Once the third fireball arrived and completed the group, the three would move close together and then disappear.  One of the fireballs changed color to white and moved just above an orange one.  The two merged together and then disappeared together.  Evidently they don’t need three to make an exit. We could see that the fireballs seemed to be playful in their movement about each other, and they were capable of changing color to yellow, orange, red, or white.  The last fireball reached its Easterly destination at about 8:10 PM and then disappeared with its two mates. We did not get any pictures but found many videos and pictures of fireballs just like them on the internet. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous provides no contact information.

At least 25 orange and red fireballs fly over New Bedford, MA, USA;2011-10-11 19:42:00;30-Minutes;At least 25 orange and red fireballs fly over New Bedford, MA, USA On Sunday night, October 11, 2011 my family and I saw at least 25 alien fireballs fly over our house in New Bedford, MA. It was an unusually warm night with very clear skies.   At 7:42 PM, my son was driving near a local Park when he saw five fireballs in the night sky.  These dazzling fireballs displayed complex patterns of symmetrical movement.  Although he was only a few blocks away, he immediately phoned us so we went out into the street to observe it.  Sure enough, the objects were flying over our house in single file and they made no sound.   A new fireball would appear just over the Western horizon about every 30 seconds.  Each appeared as an orange and red fireball.  The size of these fireballs was a little smaller than the size of your pinky’s fingernail if you stretched your arm out in front of you.   They moved past us and onto their rendezvous point just above the eastern horizon where groups of two or three of them would congregate and then disappear together as a group.  One of the fireballs changed color to white and merged with an orange one at their rendezvous point.  The last ship disappeared at about 8:10 PM.   We did not get a picture or a video, but we found plenty of videos and pictures of these same objects on the internet.;41.6446547008547;-70.9332888888888
((HOAX??))  Four orbs, different directions.;2016-06-29 20:30:00;15 minutes;Four orbs, different directions. Began to get this electrical feeling to look up, as i usually see them often.  This was the first time in about a year, since which is odd to me.   At about 45000 feet, I observed multiple orbs flying, very steadily fast.  No sound, no other lights, naked eye;41.6446547008547;-70.9332888888888
