Disk-like object floating over new bedford aprox. 300' in air.;2011-09-02 19:00:00;20 minutes;Disk-like object floating over new bedford aprox.300' in air.  This object had some kind of glow around it with absolutley no sound.  No lights! but the sunset shimmerd over this object making it look metallic. It moved in ways ive never seen with human-like aircrafts.I tried to record this object with two smartphones and i could not see the object thru the viewfinder, only by eye.  When it departed, it was gone instantly. Amazing!;41.6446547008547;-70.9332888888888
