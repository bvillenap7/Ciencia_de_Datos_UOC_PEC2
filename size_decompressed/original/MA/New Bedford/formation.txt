Five lights fly over New Bedford Harbor in strange formation;2003-10-03 20:40:00;8 minutes;Five lights fly over New Bedford Harbor in strange formation While traveling south on Route 18, at roughly 20:40. I noticed five (5) white lights flying over the highway in an odd way.  They appeared to me at first to be airplanes, but after watching more closely, there were no red tail lights.  They moved across the night sky towards a transmission towers that were flashing red warning lights.  At this time, the five lights appeared to hover next to these red lights, making me think they were helicopters searching for something.  I turned my vehicle around to follow the white lights, and as I did, I noticed that the hovering continued until I was probably mile away from the transmission lights, when suddenly all five lights went out simultaneously.  They did not land anywhere, not did anything else appear next to them when the lights went out.  All totalled the experience lasted 8-10 minutes from the time of sighting to the lights shutting off.  To note the type of weather outside was partly cloudy, but warm.  The lights appeared in a well lit area overlooking New Bedford Harbor, and a highway illuminated with many lights.;41.6446547008547;-70.9332888888888
Glowing orbs flying in formation in the New Bedford sky;2011-08-19 21:00:00;5-6 minutes;Glowing orbs flying in formation in the New Bedford sky While Driving down North Street in the west end of New Bedford, my wife and I came down a hill, and noticed what looked like a large crane with three lights on it, rising over a tree in the distance. Suddenly the three lights shot up into the air like fireworks that never extinguished.  There were three orangish-red twinkling orbs in the sky. I pulled over and got out of my car and noticed others were doing the same as me.  The three orbs formed a triangle in the sky that hovered for 10 seconds or so. then the shape dispersed and the orbs started doing 'S' patterns, slowly hovering around the sky. Then the three orbs, which were at least 2-3 times the size of a normal plane flashing in the sky, formed what looked like a bird's wingspan. the orbs held this formation for approximately 10 seconds, before forming a straight line and fading into the clouds one by one.;41.6446547008547;-70.9332888888888
Four lights flying in formation over the city;2020-10-09 20:00:00;10 minutes;Four lights flying in formation over the city On Friday night, I observed four lights that appeared to fly in formation across the city, south to north. After attempting to take some photos, I began to follow the lights as best I could. After about a mile, the lights disappeared. The lights were in a 2x2 formation and stayed at the same altitude the entirety of my sighting.  I am an aviation enthusiast and typically watch the skies. We have a regional airport in the city with small commercial aircraft, business jets, and personal aircraft. This night I had been watching some of the planes from the school circling in the pattern. Unlike those known aircraft, these lights did not have any positional strobes and were not in the pattern for the airport.  When returned from my chase, my coworker was returning and reported seeing the same lights but he was further south when he first spotted them.;41.6446547008547;-70.9332888888888
