We;2014-09-22 21:30:00;4-5 minutes;Around 930 pm my son and I were outside cooking on the grill, it was a fairly clear evening . We noticed how bright the stars were.  We where looking also at all aircraft lights we noticed.  I was telling my son I I started looking up again, he laughed, we always see the unexplained in the sky and I took a break recently.  We were looking south and up verifying aircraft flashing lights.  Thats when an orange glowing light appeared flying north with an easterly direction.  The glow was not flashing it had a slow  consistant pulsation with a strong amber glow. . As it traveled it seem to get weaker as if it were passing through a cloud.About three more pulsations then it was gone.   I know this was no aircraft, no flashing lights just orange glow with pulsation ..thanks for reading this and keep looking up.. ((NUFORC Note:  We have corrected the time above.

I observed a single, fairly large, blueish oval/pill shaped object with a lighter blueish tint/halo surrounding it.((anonymous report));2019-06-08 23:34:00;4-5 seconds;I observed a single, fairly large, blueish oval/pill shaped object with a lighter blueish tint/halo surrounding it.  It traveled in the clear night sky, in low earth orbit, at very high speeds with no audible sounds.  It was slightly slower than a meteorite/shooting star and much much faster than a satellite.  It had no visible tail and kept on path heading from West to East and was only in my field of view for about 4 to 5 seconds.  At the time I was star gazing and looking up at the big dipper constellation.  Roughly 4 minutes later a passenger jet or possibly a private jet was on a similar path but moving quite slow.
