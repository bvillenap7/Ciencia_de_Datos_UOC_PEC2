There was what I would describe as an anomaly of light, about the size of a softball if held at arm's length above my head, directly above my house.  It was toward the northern sky but more centrally located from all four directions.  My daughter and husband saw it before I did and they reported more activity than I witnessed.  What I saw was a circular blueish-white light that had dark, changing shapes passing in and out of it.;42.0491;-71.8944
Pulsating white glow and active dark forms appear high in sky near Southern Worcester County, MA.;2010-07-14 23:00:00;over 20minutes;Pulsating white glow and active dark forms appear high in sky near Southern Worcester County, MA. Tonight is very cloudy and the sky has warm grey/orange cast to it. I was outside with my dogs, when this bluish/white halo appeared high in the sky directly above my house and quickly pulsated three times.  At first, I thought it was a weather light then the pulsating stopped and became somewhat constant except for a subtly changing glow.   The circumference of the illumination would grow and shrink.  There also appeared to be dark cloud-like forms (some were cigar shaped, some shadows changed size & shape) shifting and moving around outside of the halo.   At least ten times these shadow forms moved fast in front of the glow, completely eliminating the light.   Twice, I heard a plane in the sky and during that time the glow & shadows became very active.
