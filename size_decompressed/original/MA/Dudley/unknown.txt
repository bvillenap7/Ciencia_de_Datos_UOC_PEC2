I saw what almost looked like a shooting star except it went straight down.;2019-11-06 01:20:00;3-4 seconds;As I was driving to work @ 01:20 on Monday evening in Dudled Charlton on Rt 31 south on Rt.31 omw to N.Dudley MA from Charlton, MA I saw what almost looked like a shooting star except it went straight down, like into a g-neg maneuver.  At the end of this G-neg there was a bright green flash. Not at all like the indicator lights on a plane, it was surprisingly bright. I don't even know what I saw, but it really didn't strike me as a meteor or shooting star it's movement seemed deliberate. I cross referenced meteor showers over new england, with the date/time of year nothing. Persied ends in late August early September And Omnied (I think that's it's name) happens for only a few days in the beginning of October.  If anyone else saw this, please reply in anyway allowed by this forum...I am completely perplexed, and I would just like either confirmation of an astrological event, or idk some explanation..?  Also 2 deer ran across the road & away from the direction of the g-neg and a few Fox as well.  All were running southbound about 5 minutes later.  As the object streaked down in the northern part of the sky.;42.0491;-71.8944
