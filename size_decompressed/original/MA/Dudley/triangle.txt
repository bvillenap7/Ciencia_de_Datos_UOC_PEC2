Triangular shaped lights crossing the sky in MA on Thanksgiving  night 2002;2002-11-28 04:00:00;10 minutes;Triangular shaped lights crossing the sky in MA on Thanksgiving  night 2002 A triangular shape appeared about 4:00 am which was lit with bright blinking white/yellow lights. This shape moved north with it's lights completely outlining this triangular shape - (much like the shape that Canadian geese form) - and then turned East. As it turned east, some of the outlining lights were dimmed, and the craft then hovered and lowered itself past the tree line. We are located on a hill and have a vast view of the valley behind us - this sequence was fully viewed as the night sky was incredibly clear. It moved very slowly and the lights repeated a very set pattern..they were not random.. any other sightings of this? We would love to hear that otheres witnessed this in this area.
