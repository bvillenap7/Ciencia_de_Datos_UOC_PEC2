At first, I thought that it was the moon but it was way too low to be the moon.  So I stepped outside and the moon was behind me, this thing was huge. I went upstairs and told my wife and had told her I was going to get a better look. As I started driving towards it , it started to move quite quickly and then it was gone.  The lights were of a amber color not white like the moon.  This thing was absolutely huge.;42.0491;-71.8944
