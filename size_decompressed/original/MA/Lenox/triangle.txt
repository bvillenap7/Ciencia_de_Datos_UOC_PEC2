saw a triangular flying object in the berkshires tonight.;2011-02-09 20:00:00;15 SEC;saw a triangular flying object in the berkshires tonight. Approximately 8pm heading east on Route 90, (turnpike) going 65mph.  Skies clear.  I saw the vehicle approximately 1000 ft high  and 2000 ft to the front right.   At first the bright lights seemed like 2.  As it traveled over, and passed to the left I saw 3 lights that looked like they came from the bottom of the vehicle.  The vehicle looked triangular.  The lights looked like they were close to the points of each corner of a triangle.  No strobes or blinking lights. The event was a very short time approx 15 sec.  The speed of the vehicle did not seem to go very fast.   About the speed of a fast car.   Would like to know if anyone else saw this to confirm my story.
