I was sitting on my deck with my son at approximately 11:15-11:25 pm on 8/8/2014.  Facing south overlooking Nantucket Sound (ocean) and all of a sudden I thought a meteor appeared, so clear like a flaming ball of fire, except it was flying horizontally and therefore it could not be a meteor!  And it flew horizontal for a good 3 minutes!  It was so fast yet so bright as fire, yet so perfectly round.   It kept flying in a straight horizontal line and it disappeared as quickly as it appeared after a few minutes.   My son recorded it, yet with the naked eye it was much closer and brighter orange than the video. ((NUFORC Note:  If the data provided by the witness is accurate, the object could not have been the ISS, which passed over this area at approximately 23:39 hrs., and which was visible for less than a minute.  The ISS was visible in the southern sky, during this flyover.  PD));41.6621;-70.1329
