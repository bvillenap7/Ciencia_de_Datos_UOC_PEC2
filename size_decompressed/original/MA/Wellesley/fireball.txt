Green fireball seen close to horizon;2007-01-12 17:09:00;3 seconds;Green fireball seen close to horizon First of all I would like to say I saw exactly the same thing as the person filed a report on 1/13/07 also in Boston.  When I was driving to pick up my mom from work, in wellesley center I saw this green fireball, it was hard to tell exactly what shape it was but looked like a sphere and it coming down at an angle towards the horizon.  I only saw it for about 3 seconds until it went over the trees.   It wasn't dark out yet it wasn't daytime either, it was dusk.  I tried to figure out what it might have been and by process of elimination nothing came to my mind and therefore I must admit that I saw a ufo.;42.2958;-71.3018
