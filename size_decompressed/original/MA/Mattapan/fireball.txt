It stopped and I watched it for a minute then it took off at lightning speeds. Inside the ball looked like a roaring fire. Like the sun.  An hour later I saw 2 sets of small grey balls or spheres  flying in formation shaped like a triangle and moving very slowly. It was going in the direction that the fireball came from.;42.2743;-71.0972
