7 light object hovers and moves in a radical fashion.;2006-10-22 01:50:00;1 hour;7 light object hovers and moves in a radical fashion. I got up to view the meteor showers.   At 1:50 I noticed a single light traveling from the east headed west just to the left of Orion's Belt.  The light was moving in a foward pulse, accelerating pattern.  Dart foward stop dart foward stop.   It then stopped and using the same pattern moved left then right.  It eventually stopped and stood still.   I looked at the light through binoculars.  There where 7 lights in a horizontal line. They multiple lights where only visible with the binoculars.  The middle light being the biggest and brightest.  The lights to the left and right where all dimmer than the center light and progressivly smaller as they got further from the center.  I observed many other stars to make sure I was not seeing a refraction from the binoculars, but no other heavenly light produced the same affect.   I watched the light for about an hour.   I tried to take some pictures with a pair of digital camera binoculars that I have but they aren't that good and it looks as though nothing came out from the shots.;42.5639;-73.161
