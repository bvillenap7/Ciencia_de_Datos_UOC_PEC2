It had a consistant white light on top, and alternating red, yellow and greens lights on the bottom. I had gone out to lock my Jeep up and retire for the evening when I saw this. I ran into the house and woke up my 13 year old son to make sure that he witnessed it. It was completely stationary, yet the lights were glistening at a terrific pace. It made no noise. I went inside to get my cell phone to call the police, and when I came back outside, it was gone. Local lobstermen have been said to witness something similar to this for sometime. ((NUFORC Note:  We presume the sighting occurred at 2300 hrs., 11:00 p.m..  We have amended the time above. PD));42.6595;-70.6195
