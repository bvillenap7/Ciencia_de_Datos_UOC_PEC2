On a Saturday night in a semi-forested area I saw a what looked circular or oval-shaped flying object.  It looked to round to be a air plane in my opinion.  It flew as fast as would a normal plane (which makes me think it may have actually just been a plane) and it had two or three blinking lights on it, one red and two blue.  Though I was the only person who saw it at least twenty people, including myself, heard an odd noise before and after the object was within sight (note: the sound was not heard while the object was in sight).  The sound was very similar to soft thunder (even though the sky was clear).  Some people thought it may have been fireworks, but the soound was too continuous to be from fireworks.  I even speculated that it could have been sheets and cloth flapping in the wind, for it did sound like that just stronger and farther away.  Was this an extra-terrestrial phenomenon, I'm still skeptical.  I'm postimng because I want to hear if other p! eople who know more about UFO's think this could be something that is out-of-this-worldly.

Glowing low flying lights in formation over Rockport, MA.;2012-10-06 22:45:00;5 minutes;Glowing low flying lights in formation over Rockport, MA. Six glowing orange / reddish circular lights (not flashing). We pulled over & got out to see.  They appeared to be flying at about 1,000 feet, in single file about 100 yards apart, moving over the water from Pigeon Cove towards Bearskin Neck.  There was NO noise & No wind. Planes on approach to Logan airport were visible at a much higher altitude in the distance with flashing lights.  There were other people out walking their dogs that stopped too.  No clue what they were, but not helicopters and not airplanes.;42.6595;-70.6195
