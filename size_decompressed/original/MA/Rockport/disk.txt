I observed two objects approximately 200 to 300 yards off shore Ease of my position that appeared to be facing towards me in a Westerly direction and roughly 50 feet above the water moving back and forth horizontally towards each other and then away from each other.  Both of these objects were approximately 40 feet across.  Each of the objects had a white lights in the center positioned in a 5 star pattern.  I grabbed my cell phone and began recording the event . I was only able to record one of them as the other had moved behind a house that was within my viewing area.  The other one I was able to capture a roughly 23 second video of.  I later froze the recording and took a couple of screen shots which I am posting.  I adjusted the contrast in one of the photographs posted to show more definition.  The weather conditions were unfortunately heavy fog over the ocean and therefore I was not able to get a real clear focus with my iphone 6S plus.;42.6595;-70.6195
