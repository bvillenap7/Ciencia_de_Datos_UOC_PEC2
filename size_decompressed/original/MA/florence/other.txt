Low flying steady dim object in sky suddenly gone from view, craft roughly 50.  ((anonymous report));2018-09-06 21:00:00;1 minutes;Low flying steady dim object in sky suddenly gone from view, craft roughly 50 I was driving though a wooded area of Florence, MA.  I saw a low flying, but very still, illuminated dim object hovering in the sky.  I happened to notice a bicyclist on the road, who also seemed to notice the craft.   I was startled and drove maybe a hundred feet up the road.  At this point, I looked back, looked up, and it was gone.
