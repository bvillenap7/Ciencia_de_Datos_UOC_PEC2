I would describe the area as thickly settled residential with street lights and so, the night sky isn't black.  It hovered fairly low and moved slowly across the sky, well above distant trees, but low enough that its dark triangular shape was visible in the sky, it then it vanished abruptly.  It may have been there longer than I witnessed, but it remained in my vision for only a couple of minutes.;42.3181;-72.692
