Photographs of orbs taken;2009-04-16 08:55:00;2 nights;Photographs of orbs taken Last year started seeing things moving in the outer atmosphere, big enough to where the sun was reflecting off them.  Until a group of nine of us, was watching one specific sphere moving across the night sky, around 8:30pm, august 13th, 2008. as the sphere was moving across the sky, we watched a second sphere moving at a even higher rate of speed in a intercept pattern to the larger sphere. Upon which the larger sphere dimmed itself in light, and the second smaller sphere proceeded to explode with unearthly force. Then the first,larger sphere looked to grow with its light again and moved off at a even higher rate of speed. Even during the winter months, we noticed ourselves looking up at the night sky much more often, due to the summer events.  But to our veil, there were no sightings in the colder months. Now, on April 16, 2009, they returned., but in a different form.  They are much closer in our atmosphere. rendering them much larger to the naked eye.  But when photographs are taken of the spheres,  They appear to be moving at a extremely high speed, and at a randomized, sparatic form, leaving light trails in  a photo graph. which result with multi colored lights and almost arms extended away from what seems to be a center point.  Blue, orange, red, green, purple, the whole spectrum of colors on these beams. every single photograph represents a different formation, never the same one.  almost stretching across the whole sky in the picture, but with the naked eye, only a glowing orb.  They are in the South East of our location in Hampden Ma. About 20-30degree horizon;42.06212;-72.44836
