Saucer-type white slow moving,then zoomed off.;2003-03-20 06:45:00;2-3 min;Saucer-type white slow moving,then zoomed off. I am 12 years old i was waiting for the bus one morning as usual. I looked up in the sky and saw a strange disk high in the air about the hight of an airplane. It was white with vague red on it. It was extreamly slow i watched it for two or three min. Then a girl at my bus stop came over and I said Look up in the sky! before she could even look up it zoomed so far i couldn't see it anymore. It was going at such an intense speed It is still un-comprehendable to me. The girl never saw it because it zoomed before she got a view. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
