The commercial airliner was headed south and the unidentified flying object was headed north.  It passed right by the airliner moving at a very fast pace and as it passed over our home, it turned around quickly and headed back south.  The object was a tube cigar shape, shiny and moving very fast in a horizontal direction.  We viewed the object through binoculars and could visibly see the shape and it was shining on the side.  The sky was considerably clear, there was no sound coming from it and no trail behind it.  It just disappeared.;42.0622;-71.3412
