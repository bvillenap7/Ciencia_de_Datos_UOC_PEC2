I observed a bright light, over the ocean, too low to be a star.  It didn't move, no blinking lights, just a steady bright light, shining dimly down on the water.  I watched it for a few minutes,and turned to walk home and get my son.  I turned around twice as I walked away from the seawall towards the street, it was still as I had seen it. The third time I turned around, it has just disappeared.  This all took place in the time it took me to walk approximately 20 yards.;42.2013;-70.7543
