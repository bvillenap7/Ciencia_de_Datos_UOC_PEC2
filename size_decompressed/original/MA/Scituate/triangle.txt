I never mentioned this to anyone then but at the time of the sighting I as an amateur/semi pro photogrpaher was just coming home with my camera, telephoto and tripod and took a roll of transparancy photos. The object was high in the sky, there were no clouds and the day was perfecly clear. The object was white and bright against the daylight sky, I don't know if it was illuminated or it was a reflection from the ocean's light. The air force did send a plane to look at this object as I saw the plane, the object was larger than the plane, the airforce denied sending a plane as I Recall, this was a long time ago.

At first I thought that it was a satellite because of how it was moving, but then it stopped in the sky.   It started moving again but moving in the direct opposite direction moving east to west.   It stopped again and a red solid light appeared, it seemed to have changed the position it was in the sky, but not moving.   It then looked like it flipped its position in the sky and 3 smaller lights appeared in a triangular shape, the one on the top appeared last.  The top light then got extremely bright, followed by the bottom 2. Finally all 3 lights got smaller and smaller until it disappeared as if it does away extremely fast.;42.2013;-70.7543
