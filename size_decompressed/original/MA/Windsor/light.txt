White Object Following Route 9 In Windsor, MA;2015-05-17 23:00:00;3 minutes;White Object Following Route 9 In Windsor, MA. Driving North on Route 9, a large white light appearing to follow the road, it looked like a small airplane that had no lights just completely white.   I would say it was about 30 feet off the ground as was going approx 50 to 60 miles an hour, because the distance remained the same from my vehicle for some time.    It appeared to then veer towards Route 8 A in Savoy, but when I turned on to Route 8A I could no longer see it.
