On Sept.13,1999 Iwas on my way to work. At aprox. 04:30 I observed a very bright light over the water(where the Merrimac River meets the Atlantic Ocean)in the N.E. section of the sky. The sky was clear(no cloud cover)and the stars were visible. This light was approx. 3 times as bright as the stars and approx. 30 degrees above the horizon(it appeared much lower in the sky than the stars).It moved very slowly (from left to right).I observed it through my binoculars part of the time.The light appeared more rounded on the left side and slightly jagged on the right.Unfortunately I could only observe it for a few minutes .IT was still in view when I left.It didn't appear to be a planet (Ihave observed Jupiter & Venus in the past).I'm really not sure what it was.I hope this info has been helpful.;42.8133;-70.8814000000001
