I witnessed a silent white teardrop shaped object.;2002-05-23 12:30:00;5 min;I witnessed a silent white teardrop shaped object. I was in a parking lot.The weather was sunny with cloudless clear skies. I happened to look up an saw an unusual object in the sky.It was a white teardrop shaped object that was silent.It was several hundred feet high. It was moving in a north easterly direction.I was watching it for about 5 minutes then it disapeared.The reason it seemed unusual to me was that it was low enough that if it was an airplane or helicopter I think I would have heard it. I am an Artist so observation and description is very important in my work. I have never seen anything quite like this object before.;42.8133;-70.8814000000001
