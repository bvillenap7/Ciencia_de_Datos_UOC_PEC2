Bright, flashing, amber colored, oval object stationary above Route 6 westbound on Cape Cod, MA.;2014-01-30 05:30:00;10;Bright, flashing, amber colored, oval object stationary above Route 6 westbound on Cape Cod, MA. Driving from my house in South Dennis, MA this morning to watch my grandchildren in West Yarmouth, I noticed an Amber colored, flashing object in the western sky.  It was stationary & at least the size of a Benadryl antihistamine tablet.  Crooked like it was hovering above the Mid Cape Highway/Route 6, westbound.  I know this wasn't the planet that is big & visible because that was to my left and bright white.  This thing was flashing & Amber colored. I know others saw it because people were putting their break lights on.  This was not a plane because it stayed stationary.  Because of the snowstorm yesterday, there was no area on the side of the road to pull over for photos, and I also couldn't be late to watch grandchildren. This object was viewable to me for 10 of the 15 minutes my drive took.  I lost sight of it when I turned onto a South bound road.;41.7083;-70.2239
