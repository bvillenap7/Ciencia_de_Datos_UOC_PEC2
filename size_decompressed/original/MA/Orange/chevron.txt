Visiting my family at the home where I grew up, after everyone else in the house was asleep, I was sitting on the back stoop, in view of the woods.  Feeling calm and peaceful after a day of meditation, I silently (in my head) invited any ships in the area to reveal themselves. Within roughly a minute, a chevron (or triangular/boomerang) shaped object appeared over the woods, partially obscured by the tree line.  I counted five green lights on the bottom of the object, which glided up slowly from the point of materialization at an angle that allowed me to view its full shape. Viewing this object, I felt a sense of joy and reunion.  However, when the question came into my head, not as words, but as a feeling, inviting me to meet the occupants of the object, it came with an intense energy that was familiar in a sense, but like nothing I've experienced on Earth in my conscious memory. I was reluctant to feel fear, but I almost immediately knew that I wasn't ready to have a physical encounter.  I declined, telling the occupants they could go if they wished and thanked them for trusting me.  Almost instantly, the object dematerialized.   I sat outside for a few minutes before going in for the night.;42.6127999999999;-72.2882000000003
