Almost every night there’s a ufo that comes through orange. I’ve seen a couple but the one I’m talking about you can see if you face south and look Southwest, Towards Westfield, Ma. It rises into the sky, sometimes it does circles or goes up and down, sometimes it just flies away.  Almost always it’ll fly northeast.  My only guess is Westfield Air Force base, one of the biggest in New England, has something they’re not talking about.  I’ve also seen a triangular craft with three red lights at the points, and one HUGE white sphere in the middle fly over my house in the same direction. I got a video of it and soon after that cell phone just disappeared. It was an old government flip phone and the craft was moving so slowly I was able to film it from my window then run outside and catch it outside before it flew over tree cover.  If there’s anyone in orange on here, look for the one that comes almost nightly! If you’re not good with direction go to! the lights by the dispensary, stand in front of the brown apartment building facing the Pizza Factory, and look above the Bedroom Factory. Right around sundown. You’ll eventually see it yourself.;42.6127999999999;-72.2882000000003
