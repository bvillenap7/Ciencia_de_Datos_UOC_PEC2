On the evening of 2/26/19,, around  20:50 to 21:00 driving south on Rt.47 towards our home in South Hadley, we noticed a huge object, full of lights, hovering over the dairy farm on left of us.  Skinner Mountain was in the back of it.  It had a square configuration of lights  red, yellow, and white.  The corners each had a red light.   Couldnâ€™t tell if the outsides of the craft we rounded or not.  Almost seems it had 2 levels to it.  Overall size was maybe  60 x 60.  Initially, it was about 40 to 50 foot of the ground.  It moved slowly upwards (no sound) in a few seconds, up over the mountain which was  600 + feet.   My wife, and granddaughter all saw this.;42.3599;-72.566
