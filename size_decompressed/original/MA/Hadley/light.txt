bright amber light over Amherst-Hadley MA;2010-05-06 21:30:00;2-3 minutes;bright amber light over Amherst-Hadley MA From my location on Moody Bridge Road, looking towards the west over Amherst, and north of the Holyoke mountain range, I observed what first appeared to be a flare (bright orange) and hovering (no forward or sideward movement).  Nearby Westover AFB was conducting nightime flight ops which is what drew me to look outside in the first place (close overflight of C-7s).  I watched the light for approximately two minutes when I went to get my binoculars in the kitchen. Upon my return to the front porch less than 20 seconds later, the light was 'gone'.
