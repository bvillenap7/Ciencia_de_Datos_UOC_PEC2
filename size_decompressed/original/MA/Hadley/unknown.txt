Glowing orbs moving quickly.;2014-07-12 21:18:00;45 seconds;Glowing orbs moving quickly On Saturday July 12, 2014, I went outside to photograph the full moon.  I took one picture, but I wanted several more.   As I snapped the photos, I saw several orbs, and I took the picture.  The object appeared to be rope shape with several glowing orbs within it.  Two additional photos showed additional strange object, but with the moon clearly visible.   Please note that it was a clear night.  There were no clouds that obstructed the view.  The photos were taken with my IPhone.  I will send the images.;42.3599;-72.566
