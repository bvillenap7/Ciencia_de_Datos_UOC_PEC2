At 2 AM I took my dog out.  To the east I saw bright lights.  I thought they were my neighbor's flood lights but realized they were too high.  I thought it was the moon coming up but at 2 AM the moon would have been more to the west.  It looked like this vehicle was stopped about 1/4 mile down the hill at tree top level.  As I watched, staying at tree top level, it slowly made it's way up the hill towards my house.  I thought it was a helicopter but I did not hear any noise.  The vehicle looked like a flying car with three huge bright white light headlights.  It was very close to my house and I was getting uneasy.  I went up the stairs to wake my husband to see this flying vehicle.  About one minute went by and when we went out to look again the vehicle was no where to be seen.  At the speed it was traveling it should still have been in the area. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the witness, and we found her to be exceptionally eloquent, and seemingly quite credible.
