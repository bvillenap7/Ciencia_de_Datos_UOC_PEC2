Three Golden or Deep Yellow Oval lights over Holden, Massachusetts.;2014-08-16 22:45:00;~60 seconds;Three Golden or Deep Yellow Oval lights over Holden, Massachusetts It was 10:45 pm on August 16, 2014 - a quite Saturday night. I had just let my dog in from going to do her business in the back yard.  It was a mostly overcast and cool night outside.  I was still outside and was enjoying a cigar..   I was standing on my back deck which faces eastward.  It was dark outside and very quite. A bright golden or deep yellow oval shape light went overhead traveling eastward (I know it is east because the sun rises from this same vantage point in the mornings into my kitchen).... I don't know how high the light was because of the spotty cloud cover but it was traveling slowly - maybe 20mph - 30mph ?...but made no sound and I mean NO SOUND at all.....I was thinking what the hell was that when the 2nd one went overhead in the exact path as the first....and perhaps 10 sec later a 3rd in the same line.....by now I was a little scared  and was waiting to see if a forth light came but none did.... The oval lights (all three of them) were the size of a basket ball but without know how high up they were it doesn't really help I know.   I have never seen anything like this and was a little shaken by the sighting. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));42.3432;-71.8394
