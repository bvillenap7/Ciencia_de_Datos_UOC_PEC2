Object too bright to be a star or planet.  Object was stationary for at least 15 minutes. Decided to continue watching until something changed.  After more than 15 minutes object dimmed and began slowly moving in a notherly direction until it drifted from sight.  Could not have been an airplane or even a hovering helicopter because it was rock-solid stationary for so long.;41.4567;-70.5625
