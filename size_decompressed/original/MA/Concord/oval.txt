Large craft seen hovering over trees along Route 2 in Massachusetts.;1996-09-16 18:00:00;3 min?;Large craft seen hovering over trees along Route 2 in Massachusetts. My sister and I were heading east bound toward Boston on Route 2 in Massachusetts. Over the trees I saw a large craft hovering noiselessly. It had a gray 'hull' with a large white glowing dome on the top. There appeared to be portholes around it. The glow was so bright it illuminated the trees underneath it. I should have stopped because we were passing by and my sister was in the car reading and did not look up until I  started yelling 'Did you see it?!? Did you see it?!?' By that time, the saucer was obscured by the trees, but she did see the very bright light. I turned around as soon as I could to come back for a second look but it was gone. I know other people must have seen this. There was quite a bit of traffic on Route 2 at the time. Since then I have occaisionally snooped around on the net to see if anyone else reported a similar occurance or to see if Hanscon AFB is up to anything strange since Concord is quite close to it. I have yet to see anything but I know I am not crazy, and I KNOW what I saw was bizarre. I would like to provide photos of the area where I saw it and also to draw a picture of the saucer (I am an art school drop out).;42.4574541666666;-71.3778333333333
