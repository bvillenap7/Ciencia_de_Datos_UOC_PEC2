Unexplained light beams radiating high in the sky above west concord for at least an hour.;2013-11-28 23:00:00;30+ minutes;unexplained light beams radiating high in the sky above west concord for at least an hour A beam of light resembling a search light observed over west concord  at times there were two beams that crossed paths   these beams did not radiate upwards from the ground  rather they appeared to redistricting an unknown origin high above the tree line, almost resembling the pattern one would expect from a lighthouse.  the lights were radiating parallel to the ground not down, and were still going as I wrote this report.  Upon contacting the police I was told they knew of nothing that might explain this.;42.4574541666666;-71.3778333333333
