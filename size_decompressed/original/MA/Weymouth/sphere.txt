Multiple black spheres in sky at Weymouth Landing train station.;2015-12-23 08:15:00;8 minutes;Multiple black spheres in sky at Weymouth Landing train station During most of the sighting it was difficult to tell how many spheres/shapes there were, but it was a tight group of multiple dark black spheres (they seemed to occasionally change shape) moving roughly east to west.  No way to tell how far away they were, but there was a solid cloud deck, so they were under that altitude whatever it was.   This was sighted at the Weymouth Landing train station at around 8:15 am by more than 5 people.  Object(s) were still visible as people boarded the train and left the area.   Object(s) were transiting a normally pretty busy airspace used by aircraft using Logan Airport.  Didn't see a single conventional aircraft in that area however, which is odd.   I have held an FAA certification as a single engine pilot in the past and previously never witnessed anything I'd consider to be a UFO.
