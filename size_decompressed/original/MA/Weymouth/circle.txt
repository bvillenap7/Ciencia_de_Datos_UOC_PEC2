It moved quickly across the sky to the right side of the moon that night and made an abrupt stop hovered for a few minutes then changed direction and moved in the original direction it came in.  There are many planes in the area due to logan airport being close by but I've seen many planes at night and this one moved faster than any plane I've seen and i know of no plane that can stop on a dime.;42.2123;-70.9619
