Black Objects Were Seen in the Sky Before the Storm;2020-08-03 09:00:00;All day;Black Objects Were Seen in the Sky Before the Storm The morning of August 3rd everyone knew of an impending storm in Massachusetts.  That morning on my way to work I traveled to a sspot where I like to look at the water.  When I got there I saw a huge, black looking object way out in the distance on the horizon . I took a picture. When I got home that evening from work, the power was out. I called the power company and to my surprise heard a long, growling noise. I hung up and tried again a few times. Each time that was the only sound that was heard. No person available to speak to. Now a few days later I sit down to relax and look back at my pictures. After looking at that one again more closely, I noticed about 8 flying objects. They look like black disks and dots flying around in the sky, some close to each other, some far apart. All of the instances that happened within the 24 hours around the storm are just all too coincidental and now seeing this picture with the black objects in it... It's just really har! d to explain away.;42.2123;-70.9619
