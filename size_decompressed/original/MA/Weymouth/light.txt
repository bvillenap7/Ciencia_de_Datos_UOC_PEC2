Two lights hovering over Weymouth shoot to earth at tremendous speed.;2013-11-02 20:30:00;2 minutes;Two lights hovering over Weymouth shoot to earth at tremendous speed. Heading north toward Boston on Route 3, we saw 3 lights in the sky that appeared to be airplanes taking off in succesion from Boston.  They were on the Ocean side of the highway. The first light was an airplane, but as we continued on the second and third lights appeared stationary and too close together to be aircraft.  The two lights were white and incandesent looking.  As we drove past the lights, from the passenger side of the car, I watched as the closer light disapeared into the low cloud cover, and then the second light did as well.  I still wondered what they were, and was looking back toward where they had been a few seconds ago when one or both shot downward out of the clouds to the ground.  They did not fall to the ground but rocketed to the ground.  The only thing I have witnessed that was faster than the speed, is lightening.  The light/s created a broad zigzaggy trail visible for only a second.;42.2123;-70.9619
Bright star looking object that pluses light moving constantly.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of twinkling star??  PD));2015-03-12 19:00:00;hour;Bright star looking object that pluses light moving constantly. For the past few weeks I have been seeing what seems to be a star but it is much brighter.  As I watch it will move from side to side and up and down randomly.  It also randomly dims and sparks back to life.   Definitely out of this world. ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of twinkling star??

I decided to take short video of it, when zoomed in you see a lilac blue ring around the light.   It went on for about two minutes of it going up and down above a tree, at the very end it light up the entire sky and everything outside was pitch black.  Maybe about twenty seconds later, i hear something flying over the roof.;42.2123;-70.9619
