It was dark outside, but clouds were still lightly visible in the sky. I  happened to suddenly glance up and see a bright light fly across the sky to very quickly vanish into nothing. I would compare it to watching a firework shoot up into the sky, only this was much brighter and faster. And instead of pretty colors exploding, a quick flash of light went to nothing.;42.2123;-70.9619
