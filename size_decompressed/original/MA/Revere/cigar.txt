Strange cigar objects above Revere Beach;2017-07-18 16:00:00;30 seconds;Strange cigar objects above Revere Beach Revere Beach Daytime Sighting of an Unidentified Flying Object  7/18/17  On Tuesday, July 18th at 4pm, 3 adults sunning themselves on Revere Beach, MA, observed a metallic fuselage shaped (cigar) object in the sky.  It looked similar to a typical airplane at that distant, but the front 1/3 section seemed to be independent of the remaining 2/3 behind it. It was too far away to discern any sound from it.  It was too far away to discern any sound from it and the sky is always busy with airplane from nearby Logan airport. The object caught our attention due to its unusual shape and flight path.  We discussed it together while it flew above us.  Its flight pattern was toward Logan Airport, yet instead of descending toward Boston, it ascended up into the clouds above, until we could no longer view it.  The sighting lasted about 30 seconds.  Its speed was consistent to that of a normal plane but it had no wings or tail leading us to believe it was not a normal object we had ever seen. I took some photos using my iPhone 5c, which did capture the object but they are a bit fuzzy.  I will attach them with this report.;42.4125;-71.0034
