flashing blue and green lights on object over sea.  ((anonymous report));2017-09-28 02:00:00;4 hours;flashing blue and green lights on object over sea On both 9/28/2017 and 9/28/2017, in the hours after midnight, I saw an object hovering over the sea, roughly 120 degrees east-southeast.  Naked eye observation alone indicated a blinking star-like object that was somewhat bluer than the other stars.   Upon examination via binoculars, I could make out flashing blue and green lights.  The object did not move. It neither grew larger nor smaller, nor did it change direction.  As the sun began to rise the object disappeared with the rest of the stars in the sky.
