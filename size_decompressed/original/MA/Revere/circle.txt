The instance was only for a matter of seconds but very visible and clear.  The two of us exclaimed what was that! I can only compare it to a green shooting star yet in the atmosphere and much larger.  I came home and began to look up what the occurrance could have been with no luck.  Nothing fit the color and the way it appeared then sped irregularly fast then was gone.;42.4125;-71.0034

I couldn't believe it so I asked my mom and she saw it too. It was a bright white/gray circle type shape, It was hard to tell because the way it was moving. It was moving back and forth very quick faster than any kind of plane could move. Then it just went in one direction and disappeared in the sky as if it was never there.;42.4125;-71.0034
