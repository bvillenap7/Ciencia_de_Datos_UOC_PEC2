I walked outside and this object completely drew my attention.  It was a glowing ball of light, yellowish gold,, the color and shape of a street light/lamp post.  Shot across the sky as fast as a shooting star only this was as low as a plane landing, maybe even lower.  I'm used to seeing planes from Logan, but this was unlike anything I have ever seen in my life.  It shot across the sky until it went over the skyline, where I lost it.;42.4125;-71.0034
