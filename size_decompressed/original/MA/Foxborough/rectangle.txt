3 red lights move from straight line to triangle formation and back again quickly and silently;2012-08-24 11:00:00;1 minute;3 red lights move from straight line to triangle formation and back again quickly and silently When the entire stadium was emptying out after the Kenny Chesney concert we were all walking back to the parking lots when I looked up to the right side and one red square looked like an airplane in the sky moving slowly but then suddenly another appeared behind it and then one more in a perfect line.   They were moving very slowly like planes in the far distance.  But then the middle one moved out to the right and slightly forward to form a perfect triangle then back in line again quickly.  No normal plane could move at the precision and speed that it did.   The middle light traveled through the sky not just turning Off and On like it was one plane but like they were 3 different objects. It did it again, moved back into the line up and then the first red square light went out and then the next and the last one hovered for a few seconds and then disappeared too.  They did not move very far forward while this all went on.  The person I was walking with witnessed t! he whole thing with me and we both kept saying this is so weird looking the whole time.  There were no aircraft sounds of any type. The entire stadium of people were all walking with us so someone else had to witness this.;42.0648;-71.2504
