Triangular craft with 4 white lights seen in early September over the skies of Foxborough Massachusetts.;2002-09-08 22:45:00;2 or 3 minutes;Triangular craft with 4 white lights seen in early September over the skies of Foxborough Massachusetts. I am a 17 year old who has seen quite a few UFO's before, and never reported a single one.  This one that I saw back in September was while me and dad were coming home to Cape Cod from New Hampshire on Rt 495 and we must have been in Foxborough by then. I was looking out the windows at the stars when I saw this triangular craft.  It was dark except for four white lights, 3 on one side and one in the 'back'.  The lights slightly illuminated the edges of the craft and there was no strobe light.  I was quite interested in it, and even got my skeptic of a dad to look at it, and he had no idea what it was.  I watched as it flew in a curved path though the sky('front' tip first), and the lights stayed steady.  There was no noise coming from it that I could hear.  It was visable for a few minutes before it was obscured by trees.;42.0648;-71.2504
