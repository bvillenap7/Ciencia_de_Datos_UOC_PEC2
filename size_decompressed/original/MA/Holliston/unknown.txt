Fast moving bright light that hovered and bolted in non typical directions and speed Holliston, Ashland, Framingham fall 1971 or 1972;1971-10-29 18:45:00;1 minute;Fast moving bright light that hovered and bolted in non typical directions and speed Holliston, Ashland, Framingham fall 1971 or 1972 My Father was taking me to my art class in Holliston from our home in Ashland in the fall of 1971, possibly 1972.   We noticed a very bright light outside the rightside car window hovering over a field.  It was so stunning that my dad pulled over.   We watched as it hovered soundless, then went straight across the sky with incredible speed, went straight up vertically at incredible speed, hovered again, then back down straight,then bolted to the right and out of sight.   The next day the local radio station reported they received several phone calls in the Framingham area as well of a similar sighting.
