bright drifting light fading away into sky;2010-03-17 20:30:00;30 seconds;bright drifting light fading away into sky I was walking my dog outside at around 8:30 pm and I happened to look up at the sky and I saw what looked like a drifting star. It was very bright. I kept watching it and as it drifted across the sky it faded away and the light dimmed. I stood outside for another five minutes but I didn't see it again.;42.1303;-71.0441
