It looked like a comet.   I pulled into the Walmart where it looked like it may have hit the ground just behind it.  Nobody was around.    I'm so surprised the car in front of me didn't pull over.  I hope I'm not the only one who saw it.  I've never seen anything like it before in my life.;42.1303;-71.0441
