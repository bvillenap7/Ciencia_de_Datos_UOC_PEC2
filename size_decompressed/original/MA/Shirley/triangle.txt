It was 11:30 pm.  No stars seen, since there was cloud cover.  I heard a loud rumble noise.  I ran to the window since I have heard sounds before.  2 long triangle crafts flying near each other, in a stand up position slowly flew from East to West.  Both had lights many lights on on the underside.   It was above the tall pines and low enough that I saw it all so clearly.  It moved slowly out of sight in the same stand up position..but not up.  I got my cell phone ready if they returned, but they did not.   This past 8 months I have heard many sounds in the skies here..but what I saw was not planes.;42.5767;-71.6457
