Thursday evening 8/25/16    8:15 pm Driving down Boardman St towards Maple Ave in Sheffield, MA, saw orange lights in the sky ahead of me ... high as some jets fly.  They looked like small lights ... a bit diamond shaped ... a bit bigger than stars .. very orange in color.   Saw two groups ... one with 3 lights and the other with 4.  Each group was moving very slowly towards me and to the left.  The lights within each group seemed to move independently of each other.  Stopped my car and got out to get a better look.  The group of 3 had disappeared.   Watched the group of 4 ... got back in my car and started driving slowly still watching them and then they disappeared.  Total time of sighting was probably 3 - 4 minutes. The sky was very cloudy that night ... no stars or moon. Background of observer:  Berkshire native 64 yr old female.   I am outdoors a lot.  For the past 25 years I have been out walking daily (3 hrs/day) for bone exercise.  Have seen a lot of shooting stars but never what I saw tonight.;42.0963;-73.3632
