Green light  beam from the sky.;2000-07-03 02:45:00;1 min;Green light  beam from the sky. I was walking home after a late night fishing trip with my brother.We had to walk trough a large cemetary about half way through we noticed a green light about six to ten feet wide on a large hill at the back of the cemetary it lasted about 30 seconds and then the green light got realy bright and lit up the entire graveyard.We looked to the sky to see what it was but it was realy dark and could not see,it apeared the green light was coming from a small hole in the sky.;42.2440999999999;-71.1688000000001
