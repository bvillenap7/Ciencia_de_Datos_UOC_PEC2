He tells me to look up in the sky & there were these orange lights, individually shaped like circles coming from behind the tree line.  It seemed as if they were coming from the ground up. Once they were up there they started to move into the formation of a perfect square.  That stayed like that for a few seconds then the top 2 circles that wouldâ€™ve been the top 2 corners of the square started to separate from each other horizontally while the bottom 2 moved horizontally towards each other. As they started to disappear, we see more starting to come into view, again from what seemed to be the ground up.  They all seemed to go in different directions in very unnatural ways until they also were gone. There was also 2 black dots that we saw acting in the same manner;42.2440999999999;-71.1688000000001
