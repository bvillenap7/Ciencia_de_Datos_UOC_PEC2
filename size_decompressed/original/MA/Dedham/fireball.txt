On patrol, parked in lot with second cruiser.  Noticed two distinct flashes similar to lightning flash or transformer malfunctioning.  Looked up and noticed a ball of bright white/yellow light streak quickly north towards Boston, then light blinked out.  I have seen plenty of shooting stars, due to working midnight shift for 13 years.  This light was quick, but not like a meteor.   I also believe ball of light had two red dots of light in rear, similar in appearance to brake lights.   Very strange.
