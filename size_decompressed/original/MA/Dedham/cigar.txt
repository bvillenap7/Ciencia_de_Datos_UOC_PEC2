Floating Metallic Cylindrical Object,  Vanished Afterwards.;2013-05-12 18:00:00;2-3 minutes;Floating Metallic Cylindrical Object, Vanished Afterwards From the back seat of a car, I saw what looked like a silvery cigar or bullet shaped object in the sky, and it appeared to be floating in place, and would occasionally reflect really bright lights.  This object remained in the air for a couple minutes, although the driver and person in the passengerâ€™s seat said they couldn't see what I was pointing at.  After a short while, the object stopped reflecting and just disappeared.;42.2440999999999;-71.1688000000001
