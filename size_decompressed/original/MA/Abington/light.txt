It appeared to be ascending in the sky, which is also odd.  Have there been any other reports of this? ((FOLLOW-UP RESPONSE)) Reply to your inquiry The apparent size of the object was pretty large, I'd say maybe about 1/4 to 1/2 the size of the moon last night, or about the size of 3 or 4 stars put together.  It seemed to move a great distance in a very short amount of time.  Also, the direction appeared to be a right to left, in a large upward arc across the sky.  Are you at liberty to tell me what else has taken place at the same time as my sighting, because I am very curious?;42.1186;-70.9576
