It seemed to be moving so I focused on it to make sure it was.  There were no flashing lights and it was just one solid bright white light. It moved through the sky and to the horizon within a couple of minutes.  I used my star map to see what was in the sky thinking it could be an asteroid or the ISS but nothing showed up.  It was too bright and large to be a satellite or the ISS.  Because it was dark and the object was bright, it was hard to pick up any details of the object itself.;42.1186;-70.9576
