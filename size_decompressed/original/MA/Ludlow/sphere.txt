Small round silverfish objects over Masspike.;2016-03-18 16:40:00;30 seconds;Small round silverfish objects over Masspike. While heading east on Mass Pike in Ludlow on 3/18/16, at approximately 4:40 PM, I noticed silverfish small round shape object in the sky on the right (one o'clock).  It was clearly visible against a dark blue cloud, near a bow of rainbow, which originally drew my attention to that spot in the sky.   I shortly noticed a second such object closer to the center of the view, and later two more on the left side.  The objects disappeared very shortly.  It started raining and no more sightings happen after that. Upon reviewing the recording form my dash cam, I saw not the four objects but numerous like flashing briefly objects showing up and disappearing very fast in that area.  The quality of the recording sadly is not that great.;42.1719;-72.4721
