I look up and I see white tic tac shaped ufo with a bright reflection.  The ufo stayed and flying west at a steady pace.  The aircraft made no sounds, was very reflective and had no lights in the area, unlike the very loud, gray, and big, jets that fly over our house every 30-45 mins.  The ufo was gone shortly after taking a 23 second video.  Then four mins later it came back around it was the same silent, reflective, white, tic tac shaped aircraft.  I got a higher quality but shorter video.;42.1719;-72.4721
