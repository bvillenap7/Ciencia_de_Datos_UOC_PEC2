White orbs of light bobbing and bouncing in the sky, then rapidly moving and disappearing from sight.  ((anonymous report));2019-05-24 10:15:00;~2 minutes;White orbs of light bobbing and bouncing in the sky, then rapidly moving and disappearing from sight. I was sitting on the couch when my mother asked me to get a drink from the fridge.  I obliged, and while passing the window to get to the kitchen I saw a white, circular object bouncing low to the ground,  I called her and my father over, and we all watched as they bounced and bobbed up and down, and every time they went down more would appear on the rebound up.  They were faintly gray from the clouds, but other than that they were pure white.  They left no trail whatsoever, and eventually they all faded.  Only on remained, half obstructed by the building in front of us, and then out of nowhere dozens of lights started whirring in the sky.  They moved in all directions, all white again, and they flew left, right, forward, and back over our property.  It looked very similar to the light speed warp scenes in Star Wars, except instead of lines it was white balls that left no trail.  After that they eventually became fewer and stopped.  The sky behind them, which was ! night at the time, turned from pitch black to a lighter, orange color, probably due to sunset but could have been caused by these unknown objects.  I ruled out the possibility of planes, and spotlights, due to the sporadic nature and speed and size of the objects.  If anyone else has seen this, then please submit your report as well.  This has been my first experience with unknown flying objects, and I am truly flabbergasted, as well as my family.;42.508709375;-71.1982593750001
