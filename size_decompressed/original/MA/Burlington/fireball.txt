green descending fireball with a tail;2004-01-14 12:45:00;10 seconds;green descending fireball with a tail I was driving home at 12:45am on rt 128 in Mass near Burlington.  A little ways down the highway I saw a descending green fireball with a tail that seemed to disappear as it neared the tree line. It really caught me by surprise, the sighting was not that long. The fireball was green which I thought was really odd.;42.508709375;-71.1982593750001
