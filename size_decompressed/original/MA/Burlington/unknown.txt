Multicolored object moving vertically and horizontally without sound. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible twinkling star??  PD));2009-09-14 21:00:00;90 minutes;Multicolored object moving vertically and horizontally without sound. On the night of Sept 14th, at around 9 PM we saw a brightly lit multicolored object hovering high in the sky.  It started in the south sky then appeared in the west northwest. It had blue, red and white colored lights.  It appeared to move in a vertical direction gaining altitude and then dropping back down where it would dip above and below the tree line.  We also observed it moving horizontally.  We watched it for approximately 20 minutes.  When we went back out about an hour later we were not able to locate it.  However, we soon saw a very bright object with the same colors moving rapidly through the sky.  It flew in a circular direction around the house from the southern sky all the way around to the east.  The object appeared to be large and wide with rows of white lights in the front.  It did not have the normal signal lights of an airplane.  It also made no sound although it was flying at a fairly low altitude.  We watched it fly in an easterly direction and w! ithin seconds of flying out of view, it appeared again and was now flying back in the direction that it had just taken.  At that point, it flew out of view completely. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible twinkling star??  PD));42.508709375;-71.1982593750001
