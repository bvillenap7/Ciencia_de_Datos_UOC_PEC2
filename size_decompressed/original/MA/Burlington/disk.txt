I was just leaving work, it was 7pm, I was in a dense heavily populated neighborhood, and while driving, I happened to see a VERY bright object in the sky... I was able to view it for 10 seconds approx, before the object was lost... in the trees.  The shape was VERY much like a saucer... with some sort of line in the middle... At first I thought it might have been a STREETLIGHT, but I noticed it was moving ever so slowly... the lights were also WHITE, and not yellow, as most streethlights are.;42.508709375;-71.1982593750001
