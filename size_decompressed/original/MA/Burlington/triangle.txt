A flying wing or triangle in Burlngton, MA, just after midnight.  ((NUFORC Note:  Reliable witness, who is a public employee.  PD));2011-03-23 00:05:00;8 to 10 seconds;A flying wing or triangle in Burlngton MA, just after midnight Location of object was Burlington MA at about lat 42.4672 degs & lon -71.2012 degs. Time: 00:05 local. Date: 03/23/2011 Temp 29.5 °F Dew point 29.94°F wind calm, gusts 1.0 mph. Humidity 81%. Object was stationary when first sighted, 100-150 feet above the water of a small pond. The viewing angle was up about 15 to 20 degrees.  Distance to the object was 300 to 600 feet (or more). Closer than 300 would have put it in thick trees, farther out then 600 is possible, but only if the object was extremely large. Viewing time was between about 8 or 10 seconds, looking out a small window, in a door about 4-5 feet away. I was walking up a basement stairs, towards the door. The visible parts of the object were it's lights.  There were around 15 bright lights, red, green, blue & white. Some looked like a car's headlights in brightness and size, others seemed slightly smaller and a bit dimmer. When first sighted, the lights appeared to be slowly rotating horizontally around a fixed central axis. The rotation only lasted a few seconds before stopping.  It turned about 1/4 of a turn or 90 degrees. These lights moved in unison, maintaining their positions relative to each other, as if they were all attached to one solid object, hidden in the black sky. Viewed rotation lasted 2 or 3 seconds. It appeared to be a 'V' or a triangle shaped craft that was pointed directly towards me, and then turned towards the west. It sat still for 3 to 4 seconds and then accelerated toward the west (into Lexington MA). It's speed was moderate. The rate of acceleration wasn't fast, and it appeared to be about 25 mph, when it went out of sight. I believe it got much faster, because it was gone when I got close to the window seconds later. (Or, it's lights went out). I got the impression that I was looking at the belly and edge of a flying wing or triangle. It had a wing span that was a bit larger than the wings of a Gulfstream G350. Since it went out of my field of view so quickly, I believe it was within about 300 feet of me. Had it been farther away, I would have seen more if its slow westward fight, due to the wider angle of view at that distance. This area is a busy air space for the local airport, (Hanscom AFB) many aircraft make their base leg turn to final approach right here. So, the first second I saw this group of bight lights out over the pond, I assumed that a jet was about to crash. But, there was no noise at all.  I did hear the sound of a distant truck engine a few seconds after the object had gone.;42.508709375;-71.1982593750001
