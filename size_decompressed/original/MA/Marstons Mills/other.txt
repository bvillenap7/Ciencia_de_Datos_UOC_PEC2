It was the 24th and I saw for the second time in a year an unusual black void in the sky above my home on Cape Cod. There were  no stars within the black phenomena even though it was a particularly starry evening. It was as if there was a jet black blob that changed shape from an oblong to a kidney shape up above. My dogs were trembling as if there was a thunder storm in progress. It was the strangest thing I had ever seen and to see 2 similar occurences in the same year that effected my dogs the same way each time was really weird. OK!! Now it's getting creepy because less than an hour ago I saw it again. This time it was moving very fast as it crossed the horizon. I was alone(no dogs) and it was most definitely the same object or whatever it is , as the 2 times before. It is not a starry night at all and it is overcast. This time it stuck out like a sore thumb against the clouded sky. The object was traveling Southwest and was moving at a fair clip, which is totally different from the way I observed it the last 2 times, when it was barely moving at all. This is a strange thing and I would love to know what it is. I know that there is an Air Force Base less than a few miles from my house but it's no plane that's for sure, because it is a massive area. I can't estimate the size because I have no idea of how high above it is.  Anyway, any ideas? I'm stumped and determined to get a picture worth sharing with everyone. Has anyone else seen this before? I would be grateful for any information. Thanks again ((name deleted)), MA;41.6703;-70.4163
