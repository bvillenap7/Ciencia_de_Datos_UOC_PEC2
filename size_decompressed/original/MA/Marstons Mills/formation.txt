We have been keeping our eyes to the sky ever since our last sighting this past summer.  In the western sky we saw what appeared to be a very very bright star. We watched it for a few minutes and noticed it starting to dim from a bright white to an orange color. The object was moving slowly but clearly moving. It was not stationary. I ran into the house to get binoculars and when seen up closer you could see that it was a cluster of 4-6 lights.  The object started to descend lower and the dogs in our neighborhood including our dog, started to bark and howl.  It was crazy!!  We decided to see if it reacted to our flashlight.  We flashed the object 3 quick flashes and to our amazement the street light repeated our exact flash pattern.   We repeated the flashes several times and it repeated the pattern with the street light closest to where we were standing. Out of fear, we stopped and just watched the light get brighter and then blink out completely. It continued to go out and come back brighter each time. The light dropped below our line of site and we decided to go inside. We heard 2 jets traveling across the sky in the area of our sighting for several minutes. After 20 minutes of activity it ended and we came in and decided to report what we saw. The skies over Cape Cod, MA are clearly full of activity. That is what we saw.;41.6703;-70.4163
