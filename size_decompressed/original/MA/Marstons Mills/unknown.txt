This is the second time in the past year that this incident has happened. When it happened last time I reported it to another UFO web page I came across on the WEB. I came across this web page a few weeks after the first occurence last Feb/March or so. Well this is the strangest and most eerie thing that has ever happened to me. A short while ago as I was walking my dogs they started to pace and hide behind me, much like they do when there is a storm w/lightning and thunder. And almost exactly as it happened before, the area above me turned pitch black. I mean it was as if the sky had been painted over. The area was huge from my vantage point.Well put it this way it was either huge and far away or it was closer than I thought it was. I mean there were no stars, no clouds, no light of any kind. I could see a defined edge but the shape changed from oblong to kidney shape and then to a distorted sphere of some kind. There was no noise of any kind, and the black shape moved at a pretty slow pace. It covered very little area in the 5 or so minutes that I could see it. I was determined to get a picture of it and I walked over to my car and grabbed the binocular/digital camera I bought myself a few weeks ago to snap pictures of the birds around my yard. I started snapping like mad and took at least 50 exposures. None of them ended up looking like anything except a shot of BLACK and nothing else. It would be pretty hard to get a good picture of it unless it was a crystal clear night loaded with stars.( unfortunately tonight was a bit mixed with clouds and pockets of stars) I am so excited that I was able to verify to myself that I wasn't going crazy. Last time I was all by myself with the dogs and I had to keep telling myself that I saw what I saw and that it was OK. But tonight I saw it again and this time it hung there in the sky for a goodwhile. The creepy part of the whole thing was that last time I only saw it for a few moments maybe 1/2 a minute but this time not only did I see it on approach to where it stopped but I saw it leave as well. It just picked up speed and within a few seconds it had risen into the night sky and I could see stars taking the place of the object as it rose and then it was gone out of site. It was awesome and I wish I knew what the heck it was and who the heck they were. Well that's it. The whole truth and nothing but the truth. Thanks for keeping such a great resource site for those of us who have been fortunate enough to see such an amazing phenomonen. Thanks to all!

IT WAS EAST OF ME TRAVELING NORTH TO SOUTH AND SHOWED THE BRIGHT REFLECTION OF THE SUN.  THERE WAS NO CONTRAIL, NO NOISE, THERE WAS NO CHANGE IN TRAJECTORY.  THERE WAS NO LOSS OF MATERIAL AS FROM A METEOR.  THE UNUSUAL PART OF THIS WAS THE SPEED INVOLVED. AT THE ESTIMATED ALTITUDE, DISTANCE TRAVELED AND THE TIME THIS OBJECT WAS TRAVELING OVER MACH 10.  IT BLEW ME AWAY AS TO THE SPEED.  I WISH MY WIFE COULD HAVE SEEN IT BUT IT HAPPENED SO FAST;41.6703;-70.4163
