The craft then would completely stop and travel side to side or up and down. It travel out of sight and would come back into view until finally it stopped. Then my Daughter came out and noticed the exact same lights behind us a few miles away. I got my Binoculars and verified that they were vertically shaped lights that rotated in an intelligent fashion. We then saw tiny red lights and white ones exiting the craft from the top and re-entering at the bottom. We observed the sighting at about 9:50 and it was at 12 o'clock high facing SOUTH with the other craft doing the opposite. See Above;41.6703;-70.4163
