Unexplained object darting and pinwheeling about in the night sky of Cape Cod.;2002-07-30 00:20:00;2 hours;Unexplained object darting and pinwheeling about in the night sky of Cape Cod. I was in my yard in a very rural area after midnight, and gazing at stars, as I like to do before bed.  I noticed a large shape that seemed to be changing colors, and as I glanced at it it began zig-zagging and darting around like it was on a string or being blown in a breeze.  It was probably 5 miles or so away in the night sky, and I watched it for 15 minutes or so  before waking up my wife.  I compared it to stars, and even to a plane that flew by during that time (in a different part of the sky)and it was like nothing I had ever seen.  It would hover or sit still for a few minutes at a time, then begin the darting and pinwheeling again.  I awakened my wife after about 15 minutes of trying to believe my eyes, and after deciding I had not gone mad, she dug out her binoculars.  We saw that the object had 3 different lights (that we could make out) in a triangular patern. orange on bottom, and blue and green up top.  They seemed to kind of pulse and alternate.  We stayed outside and monitored this phenomenon until about 2 am that night (Roughly 1.5-2 hours).  It never completely left our view, but seemed to be travelling further and higher over the course of the night, until it began to be hard to make out, even with the binoculars.
