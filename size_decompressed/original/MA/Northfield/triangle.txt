Triangle object seen following the Connecticut River;1981-03-01 17:30:00;1 minute;Triangle object seen following the Connecticut River I was driving north on route 142 just by route 10.  Something caught my attention in the sky and no one was behind me, so I decided to get out and look.  I looked up, there was no noise, and saw what looked like 3 white lights flying in a triangle flying from west to east over the Connecticut River.  They made a turn and followed the river south.  Because of the way they turned it seemed like one object.  I watched it go south along the river until I couldn't see it anymore. My impression is that it was huge, fast, low to the ground and quiet. The length of each side was about 7 full moons. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));42.6896;-72.4488000000001
