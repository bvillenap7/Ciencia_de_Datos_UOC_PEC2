Ball of light being followed by aircraft.;2015-08-13 21:30:00;2 minutes;Ball of light being followed by aircraft. Ball of light was seen being followed by an aircraft, appearing to be a C130.  Both passed over to the south, then circled and passed to the North.   Approx 10 minutes later, both appeared in the southwest sky, and headed east northeast.  Very low altitude and slow speed.   Could not make out a shape of anything, only a ball of light.  The aircraft following it was very clearly an aircraft, could make out the shape of it, wings, tail and all.   No sound emitting from the ball of light but obvious aircraft engine sound from the aircraft.;42.6896;-72.4488000000001
