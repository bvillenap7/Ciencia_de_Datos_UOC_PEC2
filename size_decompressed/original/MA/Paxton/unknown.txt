A real July 4th show;2010-07-04 22:00:00;30 seconds;A real July 4th show During our July 4th celebration several of us were simply talking.  I first looked up to the sky and noticed a light moving across the sky very slowly as if it were an aircraft.  I mentioned that they had a great view of fireworks around the area and my friends looked up. Just as they did the craft made an erratic move then shot across the sky  heading north at an astonishing speed.    We are all in our fifties so we are not young kids making up a story.
