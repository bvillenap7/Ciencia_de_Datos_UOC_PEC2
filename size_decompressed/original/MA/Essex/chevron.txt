Chevron appears north of Boston.;2017-08-13 19:30:00;2 seconds;Chevron appears north of Boston Was sitting out on my back deck just before twilight watching the civilian aircraft circling in the Logan approach pattern and the high altitude military aircraft flying south over Boston.  What caught my attention was fast mover that had the afterburners kicked in moving north away from Boston at a very high rate of speed.  It is not unusual for military aircraft to be cruising in this area.  But it is unusual to see them with the afterburners kicked in with such a dense air traffic area.   As I was watching the fast mover a single chevon shaped object momentarily appeared ahead of the interceptor and disappeared.  Had no way of gauging the distance between the interceptor and the chevron shaped object.  After the object disappeared the interceptor continued north towards New Hampshire at a slower rate of speed.;42.6287;-70.7818
