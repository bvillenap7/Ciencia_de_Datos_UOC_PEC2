All followed the same path, held the same formation and were moving at the same speed.   There was a cluster of about a dozen at the begin then 4 more single then 3 more close together in the final cluster.  They seemed to by flying at the elevation that a small plane would fly at (4 or 5 thousand feet?)   No noise or engine sounds were audible.  No blinking lights or spot light were visible, just glowing orange and appeared to be flicking.   My wife and I watched for approximately 10 minutes. A couple of cars passing by slowed down and appeared to see them as well.  I took pictures and a video on my phone but the objects are very faint.;42.793;-70.9731
