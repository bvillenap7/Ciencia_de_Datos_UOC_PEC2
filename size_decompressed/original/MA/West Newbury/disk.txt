((HOAX??))  I picked up my friends to drive them to school.  After picking them up, we saw a flying saucer.  ((anonymous report));2017-01-11 08:30:00;1 hour;Around 8:30 this morning, I went to pick up my friends to drive them to school.  After picking them up, we saw a flying saucer type object in the air.  It had no lights but was very chrome and metallic looking.  The object followed us for about 20 minutes.  My friends and I had all seen it, we are 100% positive it was not anything made by humans.  When we got to the part of road where it was surrounded by woods, we all heard a loud bang noise and could not see the flying saucer type object anymore.  One of my friends said they saw something land to our right.  Us being the naive people we were decided to go check it out. What we saw has forever changed my life.  Do not read past this if you are not prepared for you everything you know to change. My friends and I moved towards where my friend thought he saw the saucer land.  We spent about 20 minutes looking until we found it.  The Saucer was about 10ft by 10ft and was like a Frisbee almost.  It landed in an awkward position, revealing kind of on its side.  We were all freaking out at this point and did not have any idea what we were looking at.  We spent only a short amount of time looking at the crashed saucer because a hatch opened at the bottom revealing a creature that was most definitely NOT HUMAN.  We all saw the creature or alien reveal itself and ran as fast as we possibly could.  We all got in my car and drove away talking about what we just saw.  We came to a consensus that the creature looked like Yoda from star wars just without the pointy ears.  I swear this is a true story and I have friends that saw the same thing as me.
