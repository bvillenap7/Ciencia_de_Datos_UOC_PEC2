No sound and it was pretty close to a plane. I was looking up in the sky and I saw what looked to me (I am not trained) a military jet and just beneath it I saw what looked like a white/opal/colored sphere.  It was going pretty fast.  At first I thought it may have been a weather balloon but after much thought it was moving much too fast for that.   crazy don't you think?   I never believed in UFO's.  Made fun of people that did.  Maybe it was something that the military is working on???? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));42.1145;-71.3236
