I kept looking the sound went away and I saw a cigar shaped aircraft with NO WINGS fly from  Northeast direction toward the Southeast.  The craft was very high but I could clearly see separation between the front half and a dark band and it looked as if the back half was separate but attached sort of like two short cigar shapes made of what I would think of a dull aluminum.  There was a large dark band at the rear of the first part.  It was really high and I could see it clearly.  No wings and it was going what I would think of as slow and I kept the object in my view  thinking I could get my cell phone and have enough time to get a picture.  I looked down and looked up it was gone it should have been in my view at least 30 seconds more the way it was moving.  If it was a plane it wouldn't have been gone that fast.  It just didn't seem to move across the sky that fast it was a clear sky.  I put my head down and looked back up in a spit second and it was gone.  The change in speed was not something a regular plane could have accomplished.   Which brings me back to it had no wings! This is the second time I have seen something in the sky from my back yard.  I saw a sphere a few years ago around this time of year.  Crazy isn't it. I am just a regular person that believes in God and as God is my witness I saw what doesn't seem to be anything I have ever seen on TV before.  I really don't like star wars type of stuff so I don't know if it is something that the movies has copied.;42.1145;-71.3236
