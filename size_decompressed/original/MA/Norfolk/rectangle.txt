Rectangle object that had several lights.;2013-08-11 00:30:00;>1 hour;rectangle object that had several lights I saw an object that I had seen a few years ago.  When I saw it before I was looking straight up and saw an object that was rectangle with a center light that was brighter than the others. It had several rows of lights beside the middle light and at the corners it had lights that beamed out to the sides of the object.   I was watching the meteor shower on the 11th of Aug after midnight.  I saw just over the tree line Zhumella sport optical and his eyesight is bad and he couldn’t see it.  I can’t explain it.  I wish someone would tell me why I see them every few years?  And no one else sees them.;42.1145;-71.3236
