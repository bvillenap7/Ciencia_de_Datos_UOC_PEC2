More that one siting over the last five years.;2011-07-30 22:00:00;30 seconds;More that one siting over the last five years. I already reported this under another shape.   I saw two fireballs glide by and there was no pyrotechs around.   It happened at 10 and 10:30.  We have had several things happen overhead and I was concentrating on the structure in the sky it had nine lights on either side with the end lights shining at an angle then in the center three lights of the nine there were lights beside it and inside those three center lights was a single light with more of a blue color hue.   I was looking at that for a few hours it was overhead and I questioned whether it was a satellite.  But last winter we had a circle made in the snow in our backyard.  My husband woke up and looked out into the yard and I tried to take pictures and a video.  I just got some of it on film.   A few years ago I had a ball of energy move from my bathroom into my hallway and hovered there. It was energy moving inside itself like balls of light that stretched and moved into each other and hovered ther! e looking at me.  It was crazy because I thought to myself I am not going to follow you because I don't want to die.   I felt it knew what I was thinking.   A few years earlier I saw a cigar shaped UFO and was told it could have been an experimental rocket.  I don't think so because it was flying over a populated area and had no fins and changed direction.  A few years before that I saw a sphere with a military plane directly above it.  I know something is going on out there.;42.1145;-71.3236
