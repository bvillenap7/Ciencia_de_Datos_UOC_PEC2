Ufo, massachusetts, circular, discs, formation, triangle;2006-10-12 17:30:00;4-5 minutes;Ufo, massachusetts, circular, discs, formation, triangle At about 5:20-5:30 pm, I was driving through a parking lot with a passenger {witness} in Seekonk and the witness noticed something in the sky, which I slowed my car to see for myself.  The witness noticed {and pointed out to me} a formation of three discs {or globes} small {because distance} clustered together, each appearing to rotate positions {switching} They appeared to have some color, very hard to see, like reddish or a slight blueish and one glinted a hint of metalic.  These {discs} rotated eaches positing {which were clustered in three, like a triangle} and then would stack on each other with spaces in between, like on top of each other repeated going back to the traingle cluster and then stacking again. The actions of these disc like object did not act like balloons blowing in the wind, did not act like a kite {there was no way it could have been a kite} all business were in the vicinity. They were originally high above the stores in seekonk and as I drove through each parking lot connecting the stores together, they appeared to be getting to far to see anymore. I pulled over to get a better view and when viewing {with the witness} they completely vanished.  These objects repeated the switching positions and stacking up until we could not see them anymore. After losing sight of these wierd things, I went back to the store with witness and went shopping.  There have been alot of wierd sights in and about Rhode Island and Massachusetts in the sky.  Look up more often and you'll know what I mean! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));41.8418;-71.3222
