It was dark out so it was clearly visible. It was the brightest red I've ever seen then began to turn orange. All the while it was just hovering In the same spot. I ran to my office door to open it and upon return to the spot I had been standing, it had vanished. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
