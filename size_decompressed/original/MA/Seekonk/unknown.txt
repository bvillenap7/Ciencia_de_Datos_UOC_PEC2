Two objects, only saw reflection.;2004-05-30 18:45:00;45 seconds;Two objects, only saw reflection. I was sitting on my back deck when me and my dad saw 2 aircraft flying high in the sky. We couldn't see the aircraft, but we could see a very bright reflection, from the setting sun. The reflection was too bright to be any kind of small airplane, as they appeared to be up pretty high. I ran inside the house to get me bonoculars, and when I came back out they were gone. I was only in the house for at most 20 seconds. They were traveling at a farily fast speed if they were up that high, but this is only a guess, as I don't know the altitude OR size of the objects. Also: My sister saw the objects, and there were no clouds in the sky. I would like to know if RADAR contact was made. I did not hear any sound from the objects, I could hear plane engines later, but from a different direction. Please email me if you can find out if RADAR contact was made, likely at T.F. Green airport.;41.8418;-71.3222
