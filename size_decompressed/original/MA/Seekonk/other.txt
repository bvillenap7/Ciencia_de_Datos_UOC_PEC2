Jet shaped object explodes in white flash.;2003-07-05 20:00:00;10 seconds;Jet shaped object explodes in white flash. It looked like a jet aircraft heading south, but the lights did not flash and were all the same color. The craft was moving slow and dissapeared in a bright flash. The flash either rotated or moved east to west to east. Altitude est.10,000-15,000ft. The weather was partly cloudy. A jetliner at a higher altitude was passing near it. There were then some bright flashes on the north horizon. Similar to the passenger jets bieng reported in Trenton, Ohio.;41.8418;-71.3222
5 objects in V pattern on I-195 East in Massachusetts.;2014-07-06 14:20:00;~1 minute;5 objects in V pattern on I-195 East in Massachusetts. I was a passenger in a car driving on I195 East in (I believe) Seekonk, MA, & what caught my eye were 2 straight white bands across the sky, typically made by airplane fuel.   All of a sudden, in between those bands & at a great distance, I saw 5 objects in a V pattern, then for about 5 seconds (size of the objects looked like dots in the sky) glowed briefly (few seconds) as if they were hit by the sunlight & just as I was watching this the 5 objects suddenly disappeared.   I looked around for about 10-15 minutes to see if I could spot them again, but did not.   I am not sure what I saw, not sure if any military bases in that area, as objects were at an extremely high altitude,  I did not hear any sounds or noise from objects either.;41.8418;-71.3222
