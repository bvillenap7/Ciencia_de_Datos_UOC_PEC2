Light blue rectangle craft;2010-08-17 17:00:00;5 or 10 mins;light blue rectangle craft I was coming out of Walmart in Seekonk, MA, with my carriage and loaded the things in the back of the car, when I went around to get in my car, I looked up and way up in the sky floating slowly was a rectangle shaped craft which was partially light blue and what appeared to be occasional strobe lights coming down each side.  It was very high in the sky and passing under and threw the clouds.  I called the guy who was putting the carriages away and told him to look up at it.  He did and he saw it too.  I said its not a plane or a helicopter or a jet and he agreed.   We both thought maybe it was an airship shaped in a rectangle shape.  It looked like it had windows on one side and the back three quarters was a light blue color with occasional strobe lights on each side.  It glided slowly across the sky and into the clouds.  Later, I looked up Airships on the internet and found out that there are many types of airships nowadays and that some are even shaped like ! sauser ufos and that they now have passenger rides on airships and that companies make personal airships for people customized to whatever shape or design they want.  Also learned that the Army has made one the size of a football field to do spy work over Aphghanistan and saw a picture of another unmanned spy airship that looks like a ufo.  They said they can also operate them remotely.  So whatever it was, it could have been one of these new airships but it definately wasnt a regular air craft.
