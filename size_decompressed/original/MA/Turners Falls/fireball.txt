THREE REDDISH ORANGE LIGHTS IN MOTION DISSOLVED;2013-09-24 19:58:00;30 seconds;THREE REDDISH ORANGE LIGHTS IN MOTION DISSOLVED I was driving north towards the center of town, I crossed over the Connecticut river and noticed three red ascending lights.  I quickly pulled over and ran over the bridges edge.   As I arrived, the three red lights, which had been stationary, began to ascend into the sky.  They were separated by equal intervals laterally, but the lowest of the three was offset from the formation along the positive x axis.   Starting from the highest in the sky, the lights began to, for lack of a better term dissolve.  As this was happening three airplanes had been triangulating the formation.   When the lights disappeared, the airplanes changed course, no one flying in the same direction.;42.5957;-72.5621
