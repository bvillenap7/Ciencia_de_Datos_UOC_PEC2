triangular UFO spotted over cape cod and pursued by jet aircraft;2007-12-10 23:00:00;2 minutes;triangular UFO spotted over cape cod and pursued by jet aircraft My father saw a ufo flying very low (much lower than an airplane should be flying) parallel to the street at a fairly slow rate of speed.  He described the object as having three bright lights in a triangular formation, and the craft made no noise.  It made a slow turn above our house.  He then saw and heard two jet fighters screaming after the object, flying above the craft, as if trying to locate it.  My father is in the Air Force, and has seen almost every military aircraft.  The interesting thing is, the jet fighters were not from Otis AFB (a few miles away) because all F-15 fighters were grounded around the country due to mechanical failures (including Otis jets).  The jets had to have been from further inland and pursuing it for some time.  I am writing this report for my father because he is applying for top secret clearance and does not want to be denied it as a quack.
