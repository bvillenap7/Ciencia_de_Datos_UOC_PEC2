Everyone looked up.  Whatever it was was moving very slow was bright orange with a black centre it came from the direction all the fireworks were but the fire works were in Falmouth we saw this in mashpee twenty feet above our house.  It flew slowly over our house out over to the golf course we ran out back to see if we could get a picture but it took off so fast we had no chance to get the cameras ready.   It was pretty cool. I was excited because I had seen these two times before and been laughed at.  No ones laughing now though.;41.6181;-70.4854
