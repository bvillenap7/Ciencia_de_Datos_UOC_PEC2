Approximately 10 silver/ irridescent spheres seen flying South in a formation over Cape Cod, MA;2011-08-22 14:00:00;~30 sec.;Approximately 10 silver/ irridescent spheres seen flying South in a formation over Cape Cod, MA Was lying on a lake beach facing south at approximately 2pm, skies were partly cloudy.  I happened to be looking at the clouds and noticed approximately 10 silver/ iridescent/ spheres set up in a formation flying approximately in a southerly direction.  These were very high in the sky, far above the clouds, and appeared small due to their high elevation in the sky.  The formation was a slight variation of a typical V as seen in bird flight, but with a couple craft filling in the center notch.  I watched the crafts move south at a steady speed, then begin to diverge, and then simultaneously speed up and slowly disappear . I was with one other person that did not see the event, but remembered how I reacted. I could not explain what I saw as being neither bird nor plane nor satellite.  The craft were far too high in the sky, displayed far too much variation in velocity, as well as showing sudden and seemingly choreographed changes in direction to be any of the above listed.  Was motivated to report this after reading about the NYC sighting yesterday, and of course the occurrence of the 5.9 earthquake in Virginia yesterday.;41.6181;-70.4854
