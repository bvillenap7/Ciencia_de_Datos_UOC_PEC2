Fast-moving, silent UFO with strobe-like flickering lights spotted over Western Massachusetts, 6/16/01 23:15;2001-06-16 23:15:00;90 sec;Fast-moving, silent UFO with strobe-like flickering lights spotted over Western Massachusetts, 6/16/01 23:15 At first we thought it was a plane, or the space station, but this was different.  Faster, It moved across the entire night sky from one horizon to the other in 90 seconds.  It moved very straight and smooth and was dead silent.  Strobe-like flickering lights unlike any airplane or satellite were very evident and easily seen with the naked eye.  Can't be certain of the shape, perhaps flat oval.  The pattern of the lights is the only shape-identifier we could see.  We were observing the sky in hopes of seeing the space station pass by, however, this was scheduled to pass by our area att 22:45 and emit a solid white light.  Our sighting was 30 minutes later and a definite strobe-like flashing of several different lights was observed.;42.064275;-72.62232
