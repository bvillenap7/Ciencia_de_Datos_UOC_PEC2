Newtown Lights 1987;1987-05-26 22:30:00;5 minutes;Newtown Lights 1987 I had to put this in writing.I was 11 yrs old at the time.  It was late at night and I was out in my parents driveway when I saw something coming over the tree tops very low and quiet.  I live next to Bradley Int. airport so had seen hundreds of planes, helicopters of all shapes and sizes but this was different...it was too low, too quiet,and the light pattern was odd,  they were in a boomerang kinda semi-circle.  The lights were red,green and white,they all were illuminated but some appeared to slowly strobe..it moved from south to north.  .I would tell people about this for years and got the expected response thats weird or  thats cool.  I am now 44 yrs old...I was looking things up on google and decided to see if anyone had seen what I did that night..well to my surprise I found articles about the Newtown Ct. sightings of 1987.. along with the articles was 1 photo. Taken by Commercial Pilot Mr.Etting I believe. This photo is EXACTLY wha! t I saw that night...!! After all these years of photo after photo of nothing like what I had seen....there it was..I felt vindicated and emotional..I know what I saw that night..and hundreds of other eye witnesses in the Ct.area do to..I know that we have no idea what it was. Thank you,needed to get this off my chest. Believe..;42.064275;-72.62232
