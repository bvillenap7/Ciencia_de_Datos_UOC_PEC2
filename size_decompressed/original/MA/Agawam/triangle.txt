I hastely ran and got witness2 and showed her the craft through a large slider window. I returned outside to find the object gone. It was a cold night when I noticed three strange lights over the Connecticut river. They were about one hundred meters away and casted a glare on the water only directly under the object. There were three lights in triangular form and the craft was from what i chould see was about the size of a small house(25feetlong and 20feet high). After viewing the craft for about a minute I ran and got witness two to see the craft. She was confused about the sighting when I ran outside to view it again when the object was gone.
