The object was very high in altitude when compared to aircraft flying overhead (compared to transient aircraft at high altitude, NOT compared to local aircraft on approach/departure from BDL approx 10 SSW of our location.  The object was first observed by myself almost due north of us, and pointed out to my wife and friend.  The object appeared to be spherical in shape however due to the brightness of the object no true discernable outline was visible.  The weather was hot and humid with slight haze.  The object was only visible while wearing sunglasses, with sunglasses off the object was unable to be seen.  It was however, bright and had an almost mirror like shine to it.  It did not appear to be moving at all in reference to nearby inanimate structures.  There were 60 to 70 foot trees approximately 100 yards in front of us, the object was roughly three hand widths above the tree line.  The intensity of the light did not fade or increase throughout the sighting.  We were actually in an amusement park ride line when it was spotted.  After completing the ride we were unable to find the object again.  About the closest thing I could compare this to would be viewing a planet such as Venus at dusk, again however it was mid-day.  Unfortunately due to the fact we were at an amusement/water park, none of us had our cell phones on us.;42.064275;-72.62232
