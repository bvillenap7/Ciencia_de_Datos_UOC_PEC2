Hovering craft at tree top level, at night.  Craft lit up from inside w/4 aliens clearly visible, 3 short, 1 tall, all gray type.;1979-06-01 21:30:00;5 minutes;hovering craft at tree top level  at night craft lit up from inside w/ 4 aliens clearly visible 3 short 1 tall all gray type I was with a friend (both of us about age 9) in a rural neighborhood playing it had fallen dark and we were on our way in to his house and just before we got to the door steeps we stopped in our tracks and looked up and saw a craft perfectly still and completely silent at tree top level. There were 3 short grays lined up in a window with one tall gray standing in the back of them all looking down at us. The craft was all lit up from the inside bright white light with no visible source. As we looked at this scene with amazement for about a min or so My friend ran off into the direction of the house.I never saw him make it to the house just shot of faded out of my sight. I continued to look at this scene for about another 3 or 4 min  and kept thinking WOW, and thought I needed to share this. I turned to my left and started to move/run towards the house.  This was my last memory of the encounter and did not recall anything until years latter, but I now recall, as described very clearly. It has always left me with many questions.

There was a central shiny object with at least 3 light blue objects around it all moving at the same speed;2005-04-17 17:00:00;5 minutes;There was a central shiny object with at least 3 light blue objects around it all moving at the same speed While sitting out on my deck with my 23 year old daughter I happened to glance into the clear blue sky and noticed a bright, shiny object.  A contact wearer I rubbed my eyes to ensure I wansn't seeing things. After which to my surprise I noted 2 light blue objects to each side of the shiny object.   I pointed the objects out to my daughter.  It took a few mintes for her to see them, they were high in the sky, then she noticed them.   I ran into the house to get binoculars. She said she then saw another light blue object. She said they formed 2 shapes, a diamond then what she called a peace sign.   As I came back outside they were passing into the trees and I never did see them with the binoculars. We watched for a while hoping to see them again but to no avail.  They came from the WSW and slowly turned towards the south. I would be interested to hear if anyone else had a similar sighting on this day.;42.5996;-72.2287999999999
