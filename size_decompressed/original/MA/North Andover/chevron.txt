No noise attached. While looking for Leonid showers on my porch.  I noticed a dully lit chevron shaped object which at first appeared like a moving constellation of shiny stars moving pretty slow and steady across the sky.  There was very little to almost no noise accompanying it.  It wasn't very noticeable would really have to be paying attention.  I looked up satellites and space station tracking maps and nothing that I could find was in the area.;42.6800270833333;-71.1112520833334
Largest object in the sky i have ever seen;2013-10-23 07:15:00;5 minutes;Largest object in the sky i have ever seen I had stepped outside for a cigarette around 7:15pm on 10/23/2013.  I am standing on the steps of my backyard and in the distance i see 3 or 4 lights in a Chevron or triangle shape.  It was low and below the clouds at first.  It was in a turn at a distance so it was tough to clearly see the shape.   Also it was hard to determine if this object made sound or not because of the distance.  It was traveling away from me and i see a single red light flashing as i believe a smaller plane/jet was following/tailing/chasing it.   As i stated i live next to a municiple airport so i have seen many planes.  I only had this thing in view for about a minute or 2 because it was cloudy and at distance.  Unless my eyes played a trick on me these 3 or 4 lights appeared to be connected to a single object.  This was the largest object/plane I've seen in my lifetime and it was many many miles off in the distance.  I can only imagine the size if it were much closer.;42.6800270833333;-71.1112520833334
