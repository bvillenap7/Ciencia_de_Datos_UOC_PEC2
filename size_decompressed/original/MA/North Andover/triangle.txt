It came out of the trees.;2016-09-11 18:00:00;30;It came out of the trees Decided to take my dog on a hike on Holt Hill reservation.  Always go there for a long hike and to enjoy the view on the top of the mountain which oversees the area and one could also see Boston from it.  As I walked toward the open area to look over to Boston, my dog suddenly stopped and pointed towards the open area that you can see Boston.  When I looked over, I noticed what I thought was just a plane just taking off in the distance, except it was kind of bright.  No noises or anything.   My dog started to whine as in he wanted to go check it out running back and forth for me to move.  Kept walking a little further in the trail and it started to move slower, it was a good few miles away then it deter to the east and disappeared.  The object was triangular awoth lights on the bottom.  It came from a wooded area in the distance.  Looked up nearest airports and there were no airports near that location.;42.6800270833333;-71.1112520833334
