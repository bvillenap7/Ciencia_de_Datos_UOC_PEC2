It appeared as a five pronged star with a blue dotted circle surrounding the bright white lights.  red dot flashed in the center at some points looked around the during the sighing and saw about 4 or 5 maybe even 6 forming a circle around us.  very weird we watched them for about a hour in the dark and observed them getting bigger and smaller and zooming in odd patterns, i was able to take one picture, of one of the things before my camera died, in the picture the object appears to be a three pronged star, but very hard to tell.  also observed a air plane fly very close to one. i know its saint patties day but what we saw;42.6800270833333;-71.1112520833334
