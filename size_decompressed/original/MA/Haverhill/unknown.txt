small object floating moving up and down blinking.;2010-04-24 00:12:00;30 mins;small object floating moving up and down blinking. I'm looking at an object right now. I've been watching it for a good 20 mins.  It looked like a star at first and then when i put my glasses on i saw it was blinking a white light and light seems to turn red every once in a while.  It moves up and down, reft and right but says in the same area. It can't be a plane because it hasn't moved away. Now it's gone it just dissapeared!  I never thought there were ufos but i might be wrong.  I tried to take a picture of it but it was too small;42.7736676923077;-71.0871307692307
