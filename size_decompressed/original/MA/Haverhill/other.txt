The UFO appeared straight overhead and was a hexagon.;2009-06-25 22:00:00;5 minutes;The UFO appeared straight overhead and was a hexagon. It was a clear night.  The UFO appeared straight overhead.  The UFO moved across the sky at about two times the speed of a jet plane.  The UFO was a hexagon.  It was about 50 feet off the ground. It flew right over us.  I saw it on my front porch. My grandfather and I were sitting on the front porch talking and we heard a swishing sound.  I looked up and I told him to look.  We saw a thin hexagon two times the size of an airplane fly across the sky at an amazing pace.  It had flashing lights that changed colors.  The colors on it were unexplainable and I never saw them before.  Then it disappeared and we never saw it again.;42.7736676923077;-71.0871307692307
Kite shaped craft hovering over residential area in Haverhill, MA.;2012-11-29 17:15:00;15 minutes;Kite shaped craft hovering over residential area in Haverhill, MA While driving home from work on I-495 South in Haverhill, MA, just past Exit 51/50?, I noticed an object in the distance with multiple lights.  Given the time of year, it was pitch black, but also rush hour so there were hundreds of cars passing below this craft.  The craft was hovering to the right of I-495 about 100 yards off from the side of the highway with an estimated altitude of 200 yards.  Below was a small residential area. An accident had been reported a few exits up so at first I assumed it was a news helicopter.  However as we got closer I noticed that the object was too large to be any helicopter that I know of, and because it was stationary, it couldn't have been an aircraft, especially that close to a major highway and residential area. The craft had 5 lights 4 white and 1 red on the underbelly. I've seen plenty of shows about UFO's and I've never seen anyone describe a 4 point kite shaped UFO (the short side of the triangle was slightly v-shaped, creating the 4th point).  It appeared to be about 150-200 feet in length with 3 lights at, what I can only assume, was the tail end and 1 white light at the front tip.  The lights didn't strike me as overly bright, nor did they seem to have any offensive or defensive purposes.  They were very similar to the lights you'd see on the tips of aircraft wings. I don't know what it was. I am a college educated, internal communications professional.  I consider myself to be extremely observant and well informed.;42.7736676923077;-71.0871307692307
A blackhawk helicopter changed into an unrecognizable shape.  ((NUFORC Note:  Photo of helicopter.  PD));2013-03-02 14:00:00;1:10;A blackhawk helicopter changed into an unrecognizable shape. I was in my room, and I heard a helicopter flying by- a Blackhawk helicopter.  I took three pictures.  Nothing weird.   It came back again about 5 minutes later, and I got three more pictures.  The final picture was weird.  The helicopter was flying away from me, but I couldn't identify any parts.  It had morphed! (supposedly).  I'll include two pictures.  The first is of the helicopter before it morphed, the second one after.  See for yourself.   BE ADVISED that I made a report to MUFON, and the pictures went away.  Please guard these pictures as they are no longer visible. ((NUFORC Note:  We see nothing in the photo that suggests to us the presence of a UFO.  The object is just a helicopter, which is flying directly away from the camera, we believe.  PD));42.7736676923077;-71.0871307692307
Frequent sightings in same area nightly!;2013-09-29 18:00:00;1-6 hours;Frequent sightings in same area nightly! I live at one of the highest points in haverhill and every night since August 2013 myself and my husband as well as our kids have witnessed 2 fireballs.  Everynight there are 2-20 blinking round objects that are red, white and some have blue.  They hover in one place and then some will slowly move in a northern direction some disappear in the tree lines.   2 days ago I started seeing a boomerang shaped object that is bright white lit appear during daylight around 6pm yesterday 2 appeared.one above the other then one just disappeared.   I've captured this on video as well as tsome of the nightly sightings.  I tell my kids they are drones so they don't get scared.   It's so weird to know every evening to night you will see strange objects and fireballs.  I should also mention that we have an airport southwest of our house so u can totally tell when it's an aircraft.  These objects in no way shape or form are aviation of human kind,;42.7736676923077;-71.0871307692307
Round bright light pulsing colors in the center and every couple minutes changed to a larger square/diamond shape that pulsed.;2020-05-09 21:20:00;>45 minutes;Round bright light pulsing colors in the center and every couple minutes changed to a larger square/diamond shape that pulsed. It looked like a bright star so I got my cannon video recorder and zoomed in on it and noticed it was a pulsing circle shape from white to a couple other colors, but pulsing in the center, and every couple minutes or so it would change into a larger diamond/square shape that also pulsed, then a couple minutes later change back to the pulsing circle shape. I put the video on youtube. I seen it before a few times that past month or so traveling on this path very slowly, but I always thought it was a star and this was the first time I zoomed in on it and realized I don't know what it is. It lasts about an hour or more as it moves slowly north west out of site into the distance. I'll try and get more video when I see it again.;42.7736676923077;-71.0871307692307
