Haverhill Massachusetts triangle object sighting;2010-01-01 13:00:00;30 seconds;Haverhill Massachusetts triangle object sighting I was driving up Route 97 East and turned right off of a side street. In the sky I saw a triangle, gray object just above the tree line flying North to South.  There were no lights and no loud noises.  There appeared to be a raised surface at the base of the triangle and that was the part that I presumed was the front.  I asked my daughter if she saw it and said yes.  It then disappeared below the tree line.;42.7736676923077;-71.0871307692307
