It was a solid bright white light (no tail).  Too large to be a plane and there were no othe flashing colors around it like the ones you would notice on planes. Traveling from West to East directly overhead.  Did anyone else whitness the same? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Two planes had just flown over in the exact opposite direction from where this bright light came.  We knew it wasn’t a plane because it was so low and we knew it wasn’t a satellite because it was moving much faster and was much, much brighter. We kept staring at it in hopes to see the blinking lights that would normally be visible on a plane.  We never did. The light or star as we called it got brighter and bigger as it got closer to us.  It wasn’t pulsing or flashing and had no tail.  Then it started to grow dimmer and moving in an upward flight. It got smaller and dimmer until we could no longer see it.  Almost as if it had burned out? We looked at each other and couldn’t believe what we saw.   Please tell me, what was it?;42.7736676923077;-71.0871307692307
