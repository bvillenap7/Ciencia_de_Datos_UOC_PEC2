A meteor to the naked eye becomes something compleetly different on camera.;2013-07-06 22:40:00;20 seconds;A meteor to the naked eye becomes something compleetly different on camera. Myself (witness 1) and my guest (witness 2) were on my deck when a bright orange fire ball was behind a tree line. W 1 spotted it and pointed it out to W 2, seconds later it was in clear view and made a straight trajectory over us. W1 was able to snap 2 pictures on a camera phone, while W2 was able to watch it burn out. This sounds like a typical meteor but the pictures on the phone showed a bright white boomerang type object. Inconsistent with what both witnesses observed. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the date above is flawed.  We suspect the sighting occurred on July 6th, and we have amended the report above.
