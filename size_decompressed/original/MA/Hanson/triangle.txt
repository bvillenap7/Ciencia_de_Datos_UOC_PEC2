3 bright lights seen in the sky - forming a triangular shape and not moving;2020-01-01 18:20:00;10 minutes;3 bright lights seen in the sky - forming a triangular shape and not moving Posted on Facebook on January 2nd, 2020:  Facebook user 1:  So last night I was driving down 27 by the commuter rail station and swear I saw what looked to be a large flying triangle the sides and what seemed to be the back part of the craft was all lit up with round lights.  Has anyone else experienced a sight like this at all?  Facebook user 2: (Me)  I too saw it while I driving to drop someone off at the Hanson train station. This was about 6:20PM and as I was driving from Pembroke up Route 27 into Hanson, I saw three bright white lights low in the sky, on my left side, forming a V shape.  Figuring I was nuts, because I do believe in UFO's (UAPs), I said nah, gotta be stars/planets.;42.0618;-70.8661
