Two slowly moving distant lights.;2000-09-05 21:00:00;1 hour +;Two slowly moving distant lights. 10 or so people could see a seemingly stationary light in the ESE sky. It flashed once every 10 seconds and was'nt easy to spot. Everyone did see it by watching the right area and waiting for the flash. Binoculars were passed around and it was discovered there was a second fainter one near it, possibly a third even fainter. As we watched for fifteen minutes it was noticed that they had moved signifigantly in relation to the stars. As we watched we ruled out airplanes and normal satelites we've all seen. The most visible light was the size of a star.Upon returning home it was still there 15 minutes later having moved a little when I showed my wife.;42.0618;-70.8661
