Strange craft followed my car silently darting across sky;2020-09-10 19:00:00;5 minutes;Strange craft followed my car silently darting across sky We were on the small highway coming home, when I saw a somewhat rectangular object in the sky. It looked like a rectangle with a triangle on top, with two bright lights in the front of the triangle, and lights on the side. I know it wasn’t a plane, or at least not any plane I know of. As far as I know, planes don’t move fast and quietly across the sky, and planes don’t follow you home in the sky. I know what the planes near my house look like at night. This wasn’t it. I live near a Air Force base, that usually has big cargo planes flying above. You can hear them from miles away. This made no sound, and traveled quickly, but seemed to dart across the sky, seemingly following my car.   Ps. I’m very sorry I cannot give my information to contact me, I am a minor, and feel uncomfortable with being contacted.;42.234;-72.583
