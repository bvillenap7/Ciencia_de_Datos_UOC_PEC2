Made no noise. 2 very bright lights seen in the sky about 2 miles away and above the Village Commons.  Started to follow and catch up to it (weird because a car's not faster then a helicopter or airplane).   Pulled into Commons parking lot and got out to look at it.  Distinct triangle shape with lights at each corner and made a complete 180 and started flying opposite way.   Was flying very low and slowly, made absolutely no noise.  The weather was also incredibly windy so it couldn't have been a small drone.;42.234;-72.583
