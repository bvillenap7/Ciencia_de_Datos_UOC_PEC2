I have never seen anything which moved so fast without noise in my life.;2019-08-17 15:36:00;30 seconds;I have never seen anything which moved so fast without noise in my life. 8/17/19 3:36 pm In the sky above Stoddard Pond, Winchendon, MA 01475.   As I was sitting on my sofa looking up at the sky, I saw large clouds.  I noticed, which appeared to be a small black DOT. I have seen airplanes crossing most often West to East.  I have seen helicopter flying.  I have seen a drone fly by.  I have seen many birds, bats, bees, geese flying over the Stoddard Pond. This small black DOT was first stationary in the south sky, which caught my curiosity.  As my eyes were locked on this DOT it began to move heading northwest to our house!  But maintaining height.  After 5 seconds it suddenly changed direction and turned 90 degrees and sped toward the West.  Within 2 seconds, it disappeared from my view.  By the time I rushed over to the sliding door it was completely gone.  When it turned the DOT became like a hot dog - still black.  It happened in complete silence. I told my wife, who was sitting next to me but she could not find it probably because of where she was located due to the window casing. At the exact time this object shot off to the west our house security alarm system was triggered.  I tried to shut it off by entering the code which worked for 30 seconds, but it came back again and again.  Finally, I shut it off by turning off its electrical circuit breaker. This never happened before. I have never seen any object fly so fast.  And in total “Silence”.;42.6789;-72.0477
