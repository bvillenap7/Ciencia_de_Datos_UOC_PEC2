I was leaving my mom's house in Bedford, MA, around 9pm on Thursday, September 12, 2019.  As I was going down her street I noticed something strange in the sky, but it was too high up to tell what it was at first. As I was driving on the side streets and stopped at the stop sign before making a right to Rt. 3... my heart dropped and I grew curious and anxious at the same time. In front of me, I saw a large saucer shaped craft hovered in the sky above the tree line with white lights surrounding the circumference.  I just stared at it and when I started to pull my phone from my pocket to record, it moved left at an angle passed the trees until I couldn't see it any longer. It wasn't a plane and it was way too big to be a drone.  I did see a red light as well but white lights were around the craft. Possible UFO?;42.4881;-71.2758
