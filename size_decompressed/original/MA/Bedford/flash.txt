Unexplained  quick flashes  of light  from  a clear blue sky;2008-07-15 08:00:00;1 second;Unexplained  quick flashes  of light  from  a clear blue sky While driving south on route 3 during morning rush hour I saw a glint in the sky. It was similar to what you might see when the sun catches a mirror but it was way off in the distance. When I looked for the cause I didn't see anything but clear skies in all directions. I  figured it was a plane way off in the distance that I couldn't see but 2-3 minutes later the same thing happened from almost the exact same spot suggesting that whatever had produced it was stationary.
