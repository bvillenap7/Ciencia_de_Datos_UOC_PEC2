I was camping in my friend’s field and around midnight was finally about to fall asleep when I saw a bright red light appear in the sky, then fade away to an almost white twinkle, then flash on again, then fade. Several times this happened. My first thought was that it was a meteor, but it was raining so the stars weren’t even out. A plane was my next rationalization, but it wasn’t moving in any direction, just still in the sky. Next I thought drone, but there’s no footage to be taken in the middle of the night in the rain. I kept staring and contemplating when 3 or 4 other red lights started turning on and off around the main red light that was fading in and out still, as if creating a pattern around the center light. I watched for another minute or so, even closed my eyes and asked myself if I was just dreaming, opened them again, and it was all still happening up in the sky. I finally turned over, pulled my sleeping bag over my head and began ignoring what was going on out of fear, really. I couldn’t even muster a picture because I wasn’t sure if that would set som! ething off or something. The next morning I googled UFO sightings in Western Mass, and was astonished to find a 5 year old article from the Valley Advocate with a picture of likely the exact same thing I had seen! So bizarre.;42.6032;-72.8877
