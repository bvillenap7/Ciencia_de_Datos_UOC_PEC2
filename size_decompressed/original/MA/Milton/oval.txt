Oval shape with flashing lights. Not moving at all.;2019-10-25 22:00:00;120 seconds;Oval shape with flashing lights. Not moving at all. So my sister and I was driving home from work at 10:30-11:00 ish. So we were in an area that for miles it’s was woods and zero cell service. Then we see a something oval in the ski with flashing lights. It was just sitting there and my sister and I was thinking we’re just imagining it. Then it started moving at a fast rate that’s when we know it’s not a airplane.;42.2518;-71.0805
