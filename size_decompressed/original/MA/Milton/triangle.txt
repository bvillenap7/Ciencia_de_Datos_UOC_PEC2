At first, I thought it might be a star, but it moved, then disappeared behind the roof line of my neighbor's house, reappeared and continued on a south westerly to north easterly course.  It appeared to be about 2 miles high with very bright white lights in the front and three red lights in the rear and with other bright lights on the side.  It moved steadily, but was not in the normal air traffic pattern for the Boston area approach or departure.  I called the FAA in Nashua, N.H., to ask if they had any aircraft to report in the area at 5 AM and they said no.
