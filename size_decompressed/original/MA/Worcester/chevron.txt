Chevron shape on side and very shiny but not blinding.;2004-01-30 16:00:00;1 minute;Chevron shape on side and very shiny but not blinding. The sun was low and I was watching contrails that were very high up.  There were 6 indicating a plane with six distinct trails.  Seemingly well below those I spotted a very shiny, silvery object which appeared as a boomerang or chevron shape on its side.  It was a very cold day and I saw no contrails.  It appeared motionless.  All I could think was that it looked beautiful against the blue sky.  I looked from several positions through a large window to see if it was a reflection.  It wasn't. The side away from the sun, in the shadow appeared to have a bluish cast.   If I held my hand at arms length and used my thumb and forefinger to get a size my fingers would have been approximately 1/8th of an inch apart.  It was at an elevation of 45 degrees above the horizon. I was a trained oberver as a Naval lookout aboard ship.;42.300387409598;-71.8011229125535
Chevron-shaped object with orange lights covering its underside.;2017-09-01 20:30:00;2 minutes;Chevron-shaped object with orange lights covering its underside. I saw a chevron-shaped object in the sky, about the height I might expect to see a small plane.  The object had orange hued lights that covered it.   I would guess there were perhaps fifteen or so.  It moved slowly, perhaps at the rate a small plane might be going.  It was crossing the sky going east or perhaps south east and was a mile or so from the Worcester airport.   I was with another person who also saw it.   It went behind the trees and when we drove farther to get a clear view again, we could no longer see it.;42.300387409598;-71.8011229125535
