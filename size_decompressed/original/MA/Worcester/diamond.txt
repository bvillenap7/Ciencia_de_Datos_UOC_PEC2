Diamond shape object slowly flying over Worcester skies and then disappearing;2007-04-22 13:30:00;about 1 minute;Diamond shape object slowly flying over Worcester skies and then disappearing At approx. 1:30 pm on April 22nd 2007 I saw a diamond shaped chrome looking object slowly moving over  the clear skies near Interstate 190 south in the greendale area in Worcester, Massachusetts. I kept a close eye on the object as it hovered for a moment.  It changed color from chrome to a dark grey and as it changed color it disappeared from the sky. The sky was clear and my son also witnessed the event.;42.300387409598;-71.8011229125535
Diamond shape objects with yellowish orange lights.;2014-10-25 19:00:00;10 minutes;Diamond shape objects with yellowish orange lights My Boyfriend and I were shopping near the Greendale area and on our way out of the store I looked up in the sky because there was a light show in Worcester. I noticed ffour diamond shape object with yellowish orange lights in the sky. At first my boyfriend thought it was a group of helicopters but then we realized that they were not moving and didn't have the normal flashing lights that helicopters have.  By the time my boyfriend was driving to get on 290 west I looked up toward the Holden are and noticed another of the same object in the sky.  When we were on the highway we looked looked again and there were just two left above Worcester and the one above the town of Holden had disappeared. We have never witnessed anything like this in our lives.  We know what we saw and regardless of what some of our friends think that either it was part of the light show, it was not.  The light show was moving white light but these were actual objects and the color was far fr! om white. It was an amazing experience that we would never forget. I just regret that I didn't  take a video so I can show those who doubt what we saw.;42.300387409598;-71.8011229125535
