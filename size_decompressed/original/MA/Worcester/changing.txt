LED Nav Lights and an Ultra bright Strobe;2007-04-21 21:00:00;Hours;LED Nav Lights and an Ultra bright Strobe This would make it the fourth time in two different time zones, to of seen the exact same thing. It's a decent sized ball of lights, when focused in on it appears to be crosshair's.  A bright white cross with four particular points that have strobe type lights that you can see from afar.  With the naked eye you can see what appears to be Nav lights (red and green) with an ultra bright strobe and white lights.  I am fairly familar with aircrafts (prior service and living near an airport my whole live).  You can see aircraft fly below and around it, its distincly differeent then an outline of a plane at night. I have tape of the objects from my old house in Madison, WI.  I filmed it for hours focusing in and out and it appears to move slightly yet reappear in the same location the next night.  I just would like to know if there is anything out there that'd fit this description.;42.300387409598;-71.8011229125535
Day time morphing ufo.  From one object to 5 objects !!;2016-02-29 17:28:00;2:02;Day time morphing ufo.  From one object to 5 objects!! On February 29th, 2016, at 5:28pm, from North East U.S.A, my wife and I were outside.  My wife then saw something strange flying from a distance.  I quickly grabbed my Samsung galaxy Note 3 and began recording.  It was difficult to see at first until it got closer and we noticed it was changing shapes and went from one object to at one point up to 5 distinct objects flying together morphing and so on.  I thought at one point it was a helicopter carrying something, then realized it wasn't.   Then a totally red helicopter appeared from nowhere which is in itself unusual for us, we have never seen a red helicopter in our city, ever.  The helicopter appeared to be hovering above us watching this U.F.O!  When I finally uploaded the video and took a closer look WOW ! I paused the video at different intervals and captured those as images and the zoomed in closer, and unbelievable.  We seen many different symbols within what appeared to be like an invisible bubble around each of the objects many of the symbols were crosses.  One in particular when it was three objects each had a different symbol, a cross, what appeared to be an image of a d.n.a strand, ie. double helix, and the third looks like a person kneeling down on their knees praying.   I will send original video, along with a couple of the different images we get out of these ufos. It was truly amazing.  My wife was a real sceptic until this happened on the anniversary of her grandmother's birthday, leap year day.  I have seen and witnessed many other wordly things my entire life, but this was great because I had a witness and video to back it up.  Please let me know if or what you think.  I believe we are witnessing some incredible things at this time.;42.300387409598;-71.8011229125535
