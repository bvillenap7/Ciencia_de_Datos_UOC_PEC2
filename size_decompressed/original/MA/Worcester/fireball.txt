I thought it was a plane crash but quickly realized that it was traveling way too fast for that. That's about it. Thanks... Neil The above explanation I gave is really all there was to it.;42.300387409598;-71.8011229125535
a green fireball that moved quickly down and up and then across the sky before it disappeared.;2007-01-02 22:15:00;10 seconds;a green fireball that moved quickly down and up and then across the sky before it disappeared. At about 10:15pm on January 2, 2007, i was driving home from work and in the clear northern sky i noticed a bright green fireball.  It was directly above a church and in the vacinity of Worcester Regional Airport.   When i saw it, it shot down diagonally to the right, then back up towards the right, and then shot straight across to the right and then disappeared.  It looked similar to a firework, but moved unlike any firework i have ever seen, and there was only one, so i ruled out any idea of a firework.   I also thought it may have been a shooting star, but this looked to be a little smaller than what the sun looks like, and again, it moved in ways i have never seen or heard a shooting star move like.;42.300387409598;-71.8011229125535
2 bright orange fireballs glowing in sky in Worcester, MA.;2012-08-04 18:00:00;5 minutes;2 bright orange fireballs glowing in sky in Worcester, MA A few years ago, in August, 2012, on Pleasant St. in Worcester, Massachusetts.  2 bright orange balls in the sky.  Looked like they were giant fire balls, glowing bright orange like a flames. One object was ahead of the other one and slowly making distance, when out of no where the one trailing behind sped up quicker than a bullet and caught up to the one ahead.  Then they started traveling at the same speed til out of distance.  They were close enough to ground where there would of been sound if they were aircraft, yet there was absolutely no sound. Complete silence. I know for a fact that my phone had full battery, but as soon as I pulled out my phone to record the objects my phone died and I couldn't.  Objects seemed to cause a small type of electrical interference as my phone stopped working but my car turned on. Also, when they were passing by, for the whole 5 minutes they were in sight swarms of birds were flying and making much noise and multiple dogs were barking.  Difficult to believe but it was like a scene straight out of a movie. Lasted about 5 minutes until they were completely out of sight in the distance.
