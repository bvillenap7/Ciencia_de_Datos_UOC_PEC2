Bright stationary object in s/sw night sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of the planet, Venus.  PD));2013-11-24 18:00:00;20 minutes;Bright stationary object in s/sw night sky My neighbor called to have me look at something in the sky that he,son and his wife had been watching for about 20 minutes.  He said it had not moved much the entire time.  I, my wife, and daughter went outside to look at the object.   In the south/southwest sky was a very bright, stationary object.  I watched for about 5 minutes but it was very cold out.  During that time, it did not move.   I checked from my front hall about five minutes later and it was still there.  Checked again about 5 minutes later but it had moved right (west) and then about 5 or ten minutes later it appeared to have been heading (down) south and then it was gone.  The brightness was never dimmed.  I saw no shape to it, just very bright.  Neighbors thought it had a peak on the top (triangular).   We could see starts faintly as well as other aircrast in the sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of the planet, Venus.  PD));42.300387409598;-71.8011229125535
Small buzzing boomerang/triangle distinct quiet buzz.;2014-07-30 21:15:00;20 minutes;Small buzzing boomerang/triangle distinct quiet buzz. I heard a buzzing sound out of an open window.  Seems pretty normal being 2 miles from worcester airport.  I happend to go outside for a smoke and heard a quiet buzz getting closer and closer.  The idle sound got very quiet as this boomerang object passed over my house.   The sky still had pink in it from sundown so I had a visuaul straight over my house about 300 ft up.  Had one solid bright white light and green flashers on each wing.   The object was plane-like, except extra long in the front but wings toward back of this object.  Looked between a boomerang and a triangle.   It continued to swoop toward a landing near airport but turned and looped around and over my house another 4 times.  It was not a plane because it hummed or buzzed like a dirtbike..  I've now seen the bright green flashers and bright solid light in the entire valley randomly since last winter. Has a distinct hum/buzz sound. Are these drones?;42.300387409598;-71.8011229125535

The lights where in a triangle shaped pattern it looked like the lights where about 100 yards apart and about 150 yards above the highway.;42.300387409598;-71.8011229125535
3 rectangular objects forming a triangle;2021-06-05 04:18:00;2 minutes;3 rectangular objects forming a triangle These three objects we're not stars clearly. It was 4:18am and I was able to take five photos. The objects moved in synchronization but always in a triangle, from elongated to very tight. The objects moved as the sun was beginning to rise,suddenly two of the objects dissapeared or merged into one. The 5th picture shows what looks like a bright white like hot white and a glow or field of what looked like cold surrounding it. On the third picture there is a point where the 3 objects look like boomerangs wit perfect 90 degree angles that aligned to one another, not matter how far or close they were!;42.300387409598;-71.8011229125535
