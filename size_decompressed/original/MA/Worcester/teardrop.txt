TearDrop Shape UFO in the Park.;1993-06-08 16:09:00;12 minutes;TearDrop Shape UFO in the Park. There was me and My cousin Janice sitting at a park when we were 16 years old, actually I was and she was 17 at the time.  Any way, she thought that she had seen some fire in the distance so she nudged me to look up and over the hill that was in front of us.  There wasn't anything there so I told her she's just seeing things.  Then allofasudden it happened.  We both heard this high pitch buzzing or humming sound, and when we looked up we saw red and white flashes in the sky which soon formed a teardrop shape if you will or you may say it was sort of oval.  It hovered above us for about 10 to 15 minutes.  It was just like so wierd you know. Well anyways there it is, and if  no one believes me then oh well I know what I saw and I'm not crazy.!;42.300387409598;-71.8011229125535
