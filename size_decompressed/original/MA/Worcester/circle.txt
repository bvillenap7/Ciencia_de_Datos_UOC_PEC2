a stationery, very bright  silver circular object about  500 feet in air, 60 to 70 feet across then vanished.;2007-10-15 15:00:00;15 seconds;a stationery, very bright  silver circular object about  500 feet in air, 60 to 70 feet across then vanished. As I was driving in Auburn Ma. On Hwy. 20 heading east, I took notice off to the left in the Worcester aria sky about what looked like 500 feet in the air I saw a disk shape object that looked to be about 60 or 70 feet across. It was like a bright pie-pan shape and it seemed to be turning. It looked like a pie-pan in the sun and someone were turning it from right to left very fast. It was bright silver in color. As the sun shined on it, it looked really bright.  I looked it for about  10 or 15 seconds and I was about to pull my car off the road to observe it more when it was like someone turned off the light. It just vanished out of sight.  As I drove down the road I would look for it and for the next mile or so it never re-appeared.  When I got home, I turned on the local T.V. station expecting some news on this event but not so. Later that evening I turned on the radio and no news about this.  I thought for sure someone else had to see this because it was right in the air above a crowded city, but nobody reported it that I know about.

They were pointing up at the sky, and when I looked up at the sky I noticed 4 circular objects beaming orange lights off of them.  They were close enough to appear large to us. As they hovered away, they got smaller until they disappeared.  Another one then showed up and disappeared. Just then, 3 more showed up in the sky, making them 8 total. They were all coming from and going towards the same direction. The last three that showed up in the sky formed a triangle, to only then disappear before our eyes.;42.300387409598;-71.8011229125535
