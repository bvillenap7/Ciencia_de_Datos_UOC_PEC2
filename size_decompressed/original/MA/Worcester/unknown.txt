Two lights, travelling close and very fast, from N to S;1998-03-16 23:00:00;20 seconds;Two lights, travelling close and very fast, from N to S Two lights travelling extremely quickly from the north to the south, very high up.  Appeared to be flying in close formation, but one kept coming in close to the other, varying the distance by 1/2 at even intervals throughout the observable portion of the trip.  No regular aircraft lights, not flying in a logan or greene or orham air lane.  Too high for civilian craft, and too erratic (and completely silent) for military.  Having been exposed to most types of aircraft (including missiles and experimental craft) in New Mexico (worked at White Sands and Holloman for some time), I can say that I have never seen anything like this.  The two lights apppeared like satellites, but moved too close, too erratic.  No flames, no missile contrails.  Overall, my estimate is 50,000 feet or more altitude, 2500 or more miles per hour nautical.  I cannot explain or rationalize, though they may be more missile testing, but were headed from land to land, not over an ocean.  VERY unusual.;42.300387409598;-71.8011229125535

It was saucer-like except that instead of being rounded it had sharp sides and edges the 'front' of the craft came out to twin points. I only saw the underneath of the craft which seemed to have tons of dimly lit orange lights. It moved at a sse direction, It seemed to be at a very high alittude yet it very large.;42.300387409598;-71.8011229125535
2 UFO's with dim lights and moving with no sound.;2011-11-14 17:45:00;30 seconds;2 UFO's with dim lights and moving with no sound. At approximately 5:45pm above Holmes Field in Worcester MA I noticed what looked like several very dim lights moving north.  There was definitely a structure there but i could not make anything out.   As I continued to stare in the same location in shock, another one came, on the same north path.  It did not make any noise at all.  As a matter of fact, unless you were staring in the location that I was it would definitely have been missed.  Hopefully someone sees the same thing.;42.300387409598;-71.8011229125535

Four bizarre orange lights in the southern sky over Worcester, MA just after midnight.;2014-07-22 00:05:00;~2 minutes;Four bizarre orange lights in the southern sky over Worcester, MA just after midnight. At 12:05am on Tuesday, July 22, 2014, I was driving south on Belleview Street, when I spotted a large, round, orange light in the sky to my left…which works out to south-southeast.  Best guess is it was about 20 degrees over the tree line.  I first thought it was a star, but soon figured it to be too large.  Then I thought an airplane or helicopter, but still would have been too large for those kinds of lights.  It also appeared to be moving in a left-right-left pattern over a short distance, relative to the object.  If you google Belleview street, Worcester, MA, the little green arrow that pinpoints the road on the map is precisely where I was positioned at the first sighting. As I approached the intersection of Belleview and Chandler Streets, I spotted certainly three, and possibly four more orange lights sitting dead south in the sky, not apparently moving.  One was slightly lower than the first one I spotted, perhaps at 15 degrees over the tree line.  The other two I am certain of were considerably higher in the sky, one at 75-80 degrees and shading toward the southeast, the other at about 45 degrees, directly below the highest one. There were no other unusual objects near these, and they did not show any distinct pattern or shine light on anything near to them.  My car window was down, and I heard no sounds to possibly indicate their proximity to my position. I was near my home, so I gathered my head, and sped to grab a good camera.  By the time I got back, about ten minutes later, there was no sign of these objects in any direction. One side observation:  on my arrival to my driveway before getting my camera, I looked to the sky to see if they could be seen from my house, but in the general direction of where I saw them, all I could see was a vague pinkish glow behind the shadowed profile of trees and other houses.  Couldn’t see any stars in any direction, so I thought it might be clouds obscuring the night sky.  When I returned home, disappointed and without pictures of anything, at about 12:30 am the glow behind the silhouetted houses and trees was gone, and there were a good many visible stars in every direction. I hope someone else reports this so I know I am not nuts.;42.300387409598;-71.8011229125535
Two balls of orange light.;2014-08-08 22:26:00;2 minutes;Two balls of orange light. Two orbs of light appeared in the sky. Very bright, very large orange orbs. They slowly rose further over the ground.   At first, I thought they were just lanterns but their behavior said otherwise.  They would come together and fly apart, swirling around in a pattern that was identical to each other.  Eventually they stopped spinning at the exact same time, completely still.  There was no sound.   The lights disappeared after a few minutes.  Never seen anything like this.  I'm a very rational scientific person, and although my first assumption was a couple of Chinese lanterns, there is no way lanterns would behave like this.

Orange Amber lights Big Dipper shape.;2014-09-27 23:30:00;2 min;Orange Amber lights Big Dipper shape At approximately 11:30PM, I was driving in my car towards home.  As I was driving I noticed that there were many stars in the sky and some were in the shape of The Big Dipper.  Some of these, what I thought were stars became brighter than the other surrounding stars.   As I was now driving my car under these stars, I looked up through my cars skylight.  Overhead I saw these lights become more orangey in color and more square than round.   They appeared to be above tree level.  As I was driving, I looked up and they were overhead for a while until I drove in another direction. I've never experienced this before. It was unusual and I was shaken up by this.
