Large green streak viewed across sky.;2008-11-12 21:30:00;2 seconds;Large green streak viewed across sky. I was waking my dog before bed when I looked up there was a large green streak moving across the sky. I thought it may be a shooting star but it was moving to fast and it was green. After I watched it for about two seconds it disappeared behind the tree line and I didn’t see it again. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

It first appeared as a black dot in the sky, so I thought it was a stray balloon floating.  As the object got closer I realized that it did not move as a balloon would, It did not vary its course or altitude, or move left or right,  The object remained stationary in flight with no rotation of it’s body,   A balloon would tend to rotate, dance, and move with the wind.  There was a slight breeze of  about five m.p.h. in the opposite direction the object was heading at the time. As the object approached and passed directly overhead I estimate the speed it was traveling at about fifteen or twenty m.p.h. or about the same speed that someone on a ten speed bike would be moving at. When the object passed overhead It was absolutely silent.  I would describe it as being shaped like a loaf of bread.  The color was a very dark bron! ze, almost charcoal color with a metallic copper base. As the object passed overhead and went behind me, I noticed that  it had a  circular indent in the rear of the craft that resembled a crator. About two hundred yards behind me was an apartment complex. When the object flew over it,  The object was about two times the height of the apartment complex.  That would equal 24 stories.  Based on the size of the outside deck of the apartment, the craft was  the size of a full size truck.;42.300387409598;-71.8011229125535

My son and i were driving down a road talking and we stopped talking because we both saw a bright light in front of us in the sky that came from behind us and swooped down, hovered for a second or two and then took off straight up into the sky and disappeared very, very fast.  It had a strange shape, a not oval or egg but kind of like a round cornered box, shorter on the top.  My son held onto my arm and said. do not speak a word of this.  And i haven't since.  I can't believe it happened.;42.300387409598;-71.8011229125535
