Too fast for any plane Went from west to East, The White light would dissapear and then reappear, but it was not moving behind a cloud.  The back had 4 very close together lights.  About 5,000 ft. high.  It was egg shaped, and none of the lights were blinking.  No E.B.E.  encounter was experienced. The craft was egg shaped.  Had a bright light on the side of the craft that was white/yellow.  The light would fade out and dissapear , and then reapper, we know it was not a clould in the path of vision because none were present at the time.  From the rear of the craft there were 4 lights closely together, they were tiny compared to the one on the side, and they wren't as bright.  The light on the side when it went out would reappear half way across the sky  so it was moving at a very incredible speed much faster than a plane.;42.300387409598;-71.8011229125535

Silent craft overhead;2011-08-10 13:00:00;five minutes;Silent craft overhead On 8-10-2011 I was in a fast food restraunt eating my meal when I observed an object approximatly two miles away.  At first I thought it was a stray balloon floating because it appeared as a dark circular object. The object approached on a course from the south west heading to the north east, eventually going straight above my vehicle.  As it approached I noticed that it did not act as a balloon would, like dancing in wind currents or rotating on it's axis.  This object stayed on a steady course and did not vary it's speed, alitude or direction.  There was a breeze at the time that I figured to be appx. five m.p.h going from the west to the east, that I thought would make a balloon go off course.  When the object was about 200 yrds. from me, it was traveling about 20 m.p.h  about the speed of a ten speed bike  The altitude is hard to determine, but I would say that it about twenty stories high.  The object resembled a loaf of bread with a more rounded top and flatter bottom.  The color was of a dark bronze, almost charcoal with copper tints.  The rear of the craft had a concave circle that appeared like a crator but did not display any kind of propulsion system like a jet exhaust and it remained the same color as the rest of the craft.  The object passed by and had no noise at all.  When it continued behind me, it approached apartment buildings that were 200 yards away from me that are twelve stories high and the object seemed th be about twice the height of the buildings.  The object seemed to be the same size as the outside decks on the apartments, that i estimate to be about twelve to twenty feet. Making the craft to be about the size of a large s.u.v.;42.300387409598;-71.8011229125535

While driving down Interstate 290 into Worcester from the mass pike, my friend and I witnessed a white metallic egg shaped craft in the sky.  I spotted it first, he was driving.  I thought it was a blimp at first but it was moving about 2 times faster than the car.   We watched it for about 2 minutes.   It went behind a high rise building, than another, then it disappeared without a trace.   No clouds in the sky, no smoke and no sound.
