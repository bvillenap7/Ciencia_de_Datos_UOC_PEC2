Very bright white spherical object flew over Worcester;2009-08-14 23:15:00;1 minute;Very bright white spherical object flew over Worcester We were out in the back yard (near the top of Plantation St) having a late night snack when around 11:15PM (may have been 10:15), we saw a very bright spherical object moving northeast.  There were no blinking lights on the object.  It was larger and brighter than all other objects in the sky.  The object moved fairly quickly through the sky and there was no trail like a shooting star would leave.  There were a few airplanes in the sky (common occurence here) and it was not an airplane.  The object was far enough away that we would have heard no sound even if it was making one.  We did not get any images of the object.  There were trees in the way that shortened the duration of the sighting.;42.300387409598;-71.8011229125535
