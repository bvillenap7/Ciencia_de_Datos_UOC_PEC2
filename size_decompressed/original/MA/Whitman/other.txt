Gaseous masses in the sky;2002-01-23 06:56:00;:30 sec.;Gaseous masses in the sky Upon leaving for my commute, i glanced up towards the rising sun. After a few sexonds the sun seemed to turn into a gray haze. It moved like a mass higher in the sky, then veered to the side and appeared to be coming towards me. At this point it split into two separate masses. These masses moved in opposite directions, 1 east 1 west, until they were enarly out of view. At this point, the reversed directions, headed straight toward eachother, and impacted with a flash of light. I did not physically feel any wind or heat, merely stood staring at the sky for a near ten minutes before heading off to work.;42.0829;-70.9349
