2 reports in one, triangle, and 5 bright orbs.;1971-06-01 21:00:00;1 Minute;2 reports in one, triangle, and 5 bright orbs. It was 1971 and my father was with my grandfather out fishing late at night, when suddenly over his head looked like that he saw a very large aircraft over his head which he said was a UFO he said it flew over very fast. Iâ€™m not sure you can help with it or whatever you do, but he still talks about it today. He said it had lights on it. Id also like to report my mother seeing one when she was 6 years old in 1975 and she said they were 5 bright lights following her camper going home. That was in Bridgewater, MA. She said it flew off into the distance too. Thank you.;42.0829;-70.9349
Three red light in the shape of a triangle moving fast to the north;2010-05-03 09:15:00;30 second;Three red light in the shape of a triangle moving fast to the north I was at a ball game when a triangular shaped object with 3 bright lights moved toward the north.  The lights were very bright then shut off and 1 white light fell downward and it was gone.  It was very strange I thought it was some kind of firework but it had no sound at all.  My wife sent me a text right after to see if i saw the lights as well. Maybe I we just saw our first U.F.O.;42.0829;-70.9349
