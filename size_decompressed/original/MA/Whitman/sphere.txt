a bluish white ball of light  that moved with out a sound;1979-06-01 21:00:00;minute;a bluish white ball of light  that moved with out a sound a freind and I had been out in the back yard using the telescope i had recieved at christmas and my friend had seen it first.  It had been a clear night out no clouds or anything to say it was caused by a reflection. The only light source around the area had been from the few street lamps and behind the back yard is conservation land. An orb of 75 to 100 feet in diameter, a flourecent bluish white, it made no sound.  A solid ball of light was the only way to describe it.  Just moving a hundred or so feet above the tree tops, in a westerly directon, 20 or 30 miles per hour.  At  13 years old, my friend and i stood and watched it move along and we high tailed back to the house. It had seemed that all the grasshoppers and frogs had gone silent as it passed by. It definitely was not  a hot air balloon. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));42.0829;-70.9349
