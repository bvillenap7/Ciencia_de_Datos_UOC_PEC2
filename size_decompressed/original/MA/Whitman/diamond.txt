Two extremely bright red lights moving rapidly and abruptly through a clear night sky.;2020-10-31 22:10:00;5 minutes;Two extremely bright red lights moving rapidly and abruptly through a clear night sky. I saw an extremely bright red light after dark in the eastern sky.  The light was stationary for two minutes.  It suddenly dropped in altitude almost like it was falling from the sky, and then remained motionless.  I noticed that it wasn't one bright red light, but two right next to each other.  It was by far the brightest object in the sky.  It then began to move from east to west, directly over me at an increasing and alarming speed.  I could make out a diamond shape connecting the two bright red lights.  I ran to the other side of my apartment to watch it in the western sky.  It was traveling at a speed that's difficult to verbalize, took an extreme turn left and towards the south and was gone.  I am a private pilot with 20 years experience.  I know it wasn't a plane, due to it's lighting configuration and movement in the sky.  It moved to rapidly to be a helicopter.  The lights did not blink.;42.0829;-70.9349
