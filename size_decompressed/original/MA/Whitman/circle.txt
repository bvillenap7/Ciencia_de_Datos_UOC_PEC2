At first it was stationary, but then began moving to the right at a slow place.  It looks to be miles away in another town southwest of Whitman around the Marion town area.  About fifteen minutes after sighting it, a second one appeared a few miles away from it.  The second one was moving to the left, away from the first one.  Then about ten minutes ago, the two started moving closer together.  I'm driving with my mom and lost sight of them about five minutes ago.
