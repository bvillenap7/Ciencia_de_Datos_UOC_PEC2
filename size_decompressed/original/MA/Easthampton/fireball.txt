After turning onto East Street in Easthampton, MA from Route 5, I noticed what at first I thought to be a very strange-looking streetlight on the I-91 overpass as I began to pass under it.  As I drove between the two overpasses, I looked upward to see a large fireball above my vehicle that seemed to be slowly drifting to the northeast.  It made no noise.  I slowed my rate of speed to watch but with traffic behind me, I was unable to stop and watch.  I continued driving for a little less than a mile until I was able to pull onto Fort Hill Road in Easthampton.  I looked to the northeast and witnessed two glowing orbs in the sky.  As I took video on my cell phone, one of the orbs flickered and disappeared.  One orb remained.  Shortly after, another orb appeared below the remaining orb and appeared to ascend.;42.2649;-72.6687000000001
