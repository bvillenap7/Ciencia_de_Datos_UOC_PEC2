Cylinder doing survey.;2004-04-15 09:00:00;30minutes;Cylinder doing survey. After reading the report dated 06/01/77 and posted on 06/23/10 and titled, Encounter with small UFO drone-type object  It reminded of an incident while driving thru Medway, Ma. on Rt.126.  As I was driving south I saw what looked like a large grayish-green pineapple juice can pop over the guardrail from the east and float across the road and a height of about 2 feet.  The odd thing is that as it floated westbound it was counter-rotating.  This cylinder stayed at that height even as it floated over a stone wall and into a field, I slowed my truck down to watch it, as it came to another stone wall it maneuvered over it at the 2 foot height.  Another truck driver traveling north saw it also and asked me what it was.  All during this time the cylinder stayed perfectly horizontal to the ground. In all honesty I believe it was doing a contour survey of the ground. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));42.1506;-71.4268
