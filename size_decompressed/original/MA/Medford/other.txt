That's the best descrpition of the sound, however i looked North from South Medford and an object with white and small blue lights couldn't even make the shape out.  It started to rise almost straight up but at around a 30 degree angle.   I called my mom and girl who came out and we all watched and listened to this object eventually go straight up and then sit for about a miute and a half then drop at around a 20 degree angle left in front of us.After losing view do to a tree , it never appeared again.;42.4177341176471;-71.1132282352942
