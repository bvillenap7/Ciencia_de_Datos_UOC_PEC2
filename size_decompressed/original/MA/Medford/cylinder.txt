Round saucer shaped aluminum colored no noise hovering craft that disappeared in blink of an eye.;2013-03-03 16:10:00;5 seconds;round saucer shaped aluminum colored no noise hovering craft that disappeared in blink of an eye. On return from docs office, I noticed a aliminum colored DISK hovering up in the sky.  As i was driving in traffic i could not stop.  It caught my eye and as i drove past a small tree (aprox 7 inch diameter) i noticed the craft slightly move (as if going away from me) then it just disappeared. ???  It seemed to be about 500 feet in the sky,off to my 1 o'clock,and just a little bigger then an M&M candy(for comparison size), only saw it for about 5 or 6 seconds. BUT I WILL NEVER FOR GET THIS!!!;42.4177341176471;-71.1132282352942
