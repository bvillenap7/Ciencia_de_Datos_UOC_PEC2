Spherical UFOs over Medford, MA;2013-04-10 12:00:00;10 minutes;Spherical UFOs over Medford, MA I witnessed these two craft accidentally on my way to work above Wellington Circle in Medford, Massachusetts. I constantly look up in the sky as an amateur weather buff and lover of astronomy.  So, as usual, I looked up and noticed a plane leaving a trail and then I looked back down, but did a very quick double-take because I subconsciously noticed something odd. I saw two spherical objects in the sky, approximately 800 feet or so off the ground, flying side-by-side, heading north by northeast.  As I walked along, I kept looking up and following them.  They were over Kappy's Liquors on route 16 by the time I got to the 16/28 intersection. The light changed and I needed to move, so I did and when I looked up again, they were gone. I observed them a good 10 minutes and was in shock that no one else looked up as they saw me walking along and staring into the sky.  I've seen UFOs before, but this is the first time I've EVER spotted them in daylight, much less at noon. I've fought with myself over whether or not to report this with UFOCenter, but right now... I just feel I need to. Description: -- Round, could not determine approximate size. -- They were ~800 feet off the ground, about 100 feet apart, staggered formation. -- They were a dull white color, but seemed to be sort of metallic. -- They were moving steadily, but not very quickly. Maybe 30mph or so as I was observing. I apologize for not having any pictures or video.  I was just in so much awe that I was seeing them at that particular time of day, that I was more concerned with seeing if anyone else had noticed them. I've only told two other people because, well, you know how people react when you tell them this sort of thing.;42.4177341176471;-71.1132282352942
3 white orbs moving in the sky, rotating.;2017-07-16 12:00:00;~1 hour;3 white orbs moving in the sky, rotating This event happened this past summer.  My girlfriend and I were sitting outside in an alcove on the side of my house when we saw something moving in the sky.  It appeared to be 3 white dots moving very high up in the sky.  The three dots seemed to stay together in a triangle pattern and rotate in a circle, possibly indicating that it was one object giving off 3 light sources.  We grabbed the best camera we had (Canon 70D) and tried to take video.  It was so high up that we weren’t able to keep the camera stable enough for a video but we did get some pretty good photos, which I’ll be emailing.  It was hard to keep track of it as the dots were white and it would move behind clouds now and then.  There really isn’t much else to say about it except that we sat and watched the phenomenon for about an hour before they disappeared.;42.4177341176471;-71.1132282352942
