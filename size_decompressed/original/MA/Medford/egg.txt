We were observing Orion’s Belt and trying to locate Venus when I look to my left and see something wild.  It is the brightest light I’ve ever seen in the sky at night, white/yellow/purplish colors.  It was football shaped and relatively big.   The second I lay eyes on it, it flies extremely quickly to the left in a straight line and then in an instant vanishes.  It left behind a shockwave in the sky that lasted about 4-5 seconds.  I want to clarify that the light didn’t fly across the horizon, but rather, it vanished in a blink after flying for a bit.  It was unbelievable. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Hi Peter, It was early Saturday morning, the 24th, around 2:30 am.  Also, not sure why it says  Sighting County:  Virginia, but it happened up in Medford, MA. Thanks for getting back to me! ((END ADDENDUM));42.4177341176471;-71.1132282352942
