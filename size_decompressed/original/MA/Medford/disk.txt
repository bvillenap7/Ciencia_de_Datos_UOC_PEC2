Disk-Shaped silver craft glided over my home.;1976-07-15 13:00:00;20 seconds;Disk-Shaped silver craft glided over my home. It was a bright sunny summer day in 1976-1977.  It was early afternoon-late morning. My brother asked me to go outside to play with him.  He was around 10 and I was 8.   As my brother stepped onto the front porch ahead of me he immediately yelled for me to come outside.  As soon as I joined him I saw a large saucer-shaped craft directly above our house.  It was so large that it blocked out the sun.  My brother and I were in complete awe. We were not afraid.   The craft made little to no sound and it was silver in color, with rotating lights around the perimeter.   My brother and I started to yell into the open front door to our older brother who was babysitting us.  Before our older brother arrived, the craft had moved silently out of site.  My brother and I told everyone about what we saw but no one believed us.   When our mother returned home and we shared our story, our mother told us that if we had seen a UFO, there would be others who also saw it, considering we lived in a heavily populated area.

Round silver saucer type craft just hovering.;2013-04-03 16:10:00;7-10 seconds;round silver saucer type craft just hovering. driving back frommy doctor appointment on 4-3 aprox 410pm i saw up in the sky a typical &quotsaucer type UFO&quot, i saw this craft for 7-10 seconds just hovering about 500 feet up (maybe) I was driving and saw it,silver in color,round saucer just hovering.  I couldnt pull over cause of traffic.  As i kept looking i passed a tree which blocked the craft for less than 1 second,and then it kind of moved away from me just a bit, then completely disappeared. (or size comparison- it was as big as an M&M candy about 7 inches away from your eye, no lights just a silver round disk.   I did circle to go back to where i saw this craft,but observed Nothing else. I have submitted another report elsewhere,but was so excited I explained it rather wrong,and am submitting this one to clarify my sighting! I love my daughter more than life itself,and i SWEAR ON MY DAUGHTER ((daughter's name deleted)) LIFE I SAW THIS CRAFT!!!!  unmistakable and i will NEVER FORGET THIS!;42.4177341176471;-71.1132282352942
