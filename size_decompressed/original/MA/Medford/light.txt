I decided to pull an all-nighter because I had at best 2 hours of sleep to get that night.  So I'm sitting beside my window on my phone and I hear airplanes, so I guess that compelled me to look out the window (airplanes are normal around there).  However, I notice a stationary blue light in the sky that is relatively small in my sight since it was far away.  After looking at this light, I see it dim and then quickly shoot upwards while still dimming until it disappeared. It disappeared for a bit then reappeared stationary in the same general area one time, dimmed and disappeared again, and reappearing a ways further.  At some points it would go dim to where I thought I saw multiple dimmed blue lights faintly moving around the sky. I do distinctly remember seeing a dim blue light flying left, then upwards while disappearing. This was most likely another ufo, but it's possible it was the same one I first seen just reappearing at another spot very fast.! What I took away from the experience was deep mystery and intelligence. The lights did not move like objects on a fixed course, but rather moved intelligently like an insect flies.;42.4177341176471;-71.1132282352942
