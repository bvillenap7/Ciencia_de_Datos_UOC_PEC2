round white saucer with lights on the bottom and made no sound.;1970-06-01 19:30:00;2 times;round white saucer with lights on the bottom and made no sound. I was walking by a park in Medford, MA.  I looked up at the sky and saw several round ships flying around the sky.  Like a fool, after seeing them I ran up the street and told some people what I saw.  They ran back to the park with me and they were gone.  Needless to say I felt like a jerk.  I continued on my walk as this night I was meeting a friend of mine to go out for the night.  When I met my friend I told her what happened and she got a good chuckle out of the story and told me I was crazy.  We were walking on Riverside Avenue and went down to a field area in order to save time and take a shortcut.  I saw a dog running and barking.  I thought this was strange as I knew if a dog was barking there was someone in the field.  I am thinking at the time, a person was down here.  Believe me I was not thinking space ships.  I then looked up and there was the ship.  It was very white, round, and had lights around the bottom of it.  It was over our heads so I could not see the top of it.  It was so close to us that if you had a good arm you could have thrown a rock and hit it.   That is how close it was to us.  I was scared shitless.  This ship made no noise at all.  I could not understand this.  I then said to my friend, look there is one of the ships I saw before.  I told you I was not crazy when I saw them in the park.  My friend started to run away and I was (no way) going to stay there by myself looking at this thing.  I ran after her.  I tried to tell our mutual friends what we saw.  In fact, one time when I did tell others my friend got very upset with me and did not want to admit seeing anything.  She just gave me a look when I was telling the story to others that I should just shut up. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
