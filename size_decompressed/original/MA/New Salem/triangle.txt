Triangle shaped craft over Quabbin with red or color changing lights in the middle of craft;2015-03-09 21:00:00;2 minutes;Triangle shaped craft over quabbin with red or color changing lights in the middle of craft The object was initially seen on the west side of Rt 202 North.  My wife and I thought there was some sort of fire at the top of the trees.   It then became clear that it was two very bright lights above the trees that looked as if they burned in a white fire.  We rounded the corner and lost sight of the object for just a moment and it reappeared on the east side of Rt 202, hovering over the Quabbin reservoir and there was a red light in the middle of what appeared to be a triangular shaped aircraft that was capable of moving back and forth without turning and the craft began to descend without any lateral movement.  It appeared large but was difficult to discern how big because it was very bright lights in front of a very dark sky.   My wife was able to get a better look at the light or lights in the middle and claims they had a changing color aura that ranged from red to blue to green.   We continued North on 202 with no other incident. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, who wishes to remain anonymous.  He sounded to us to be a quite serious-minded individual, and we suspect that he is a highly reliable witness.  PD));42.5166;-72.3014
