Here is my report per our 0145 discussion this morning. I was walking back to my process building from the shower when I saw two very bright white strobes in the sky. I stopped to watch them, and noticed that instead of being next to each other (as in wingtip strobes) they were trailing. The appearance of the strobes was such that they appeared to be at a fairly low altitude. There were no other lights (as in tail or belly beacons, nav lights, or anti-collision). I was looking north, and the lights moved in a slightly curving path from roughly NW to NE. They moved at a fairly slow pace. Because the lights appeared to be at low altitude, I tried to listen for some kind of noise. It was absolutely silent. I have been involved in avaition my entire life, and I have NEVER seen anything like this before. The sighting lasted about 2 to 3 minutes.;42.1029635258357;-72.5717899696044
Bright green light above the mass pike. Fell to ground then disappeared.;2009-01-23 09:00:00;Seconds;Bright green light above the mass pike. Fell to ground then disappeared. Me and Roommate were driving down the mass pike when out of no where this really bright green light showed up in the middle of the sky and then started to drop like a shooting star, while it was falling it disappeared. neither one of us has ever seen anything like it. It was much larger then a shooting star. It left a bright green trail for a second after it was gone.;42.1029635258357;-72.5717899696044
Reddish/orange light observed moving low in night sky West to East no flashing or sounds.;2010-07-04 22:00:00;30 seconds;Reddish/orange light observed moving low in night sky West to East no flashing or sounds. While observing local fireworks, noticed reddish/orange light in sky approaching from the Western sky.  Appeared to be height of low-flying aircraft.  Light continued across sky towards the East no change in color, size or rate of movement.   Wife and I did not hear any airplane sounds.  Light was not flashing (like those found on a plane).;42.1029635258357;-72.5717899696044
Green light appears out of nowhere in night sky;2010-09-26 22:00:00;2 seconds;Green light appears out of nowhere in night sky I was outside smoking a cigerette when I still smoked cigarettes, looking at the sky. Sitting on my steps I was looking straight at the skyline. It was about 10pm, and dark.   All of a sudden I saw a green light flash across the sky. It came out of nowhere. If you stuck your arms out to measure the distance it travelled, it would have been about a foot between my arms as a measure.  It seemed to appear at the same height as the stars, and shot across the sky then disappeared.  Was this a shooting star or a comet?  I don't know. Are comets or shooting stars a green blob circle of light that shoots across the sky?  I've seen shooting stars and a meteor shower before. Neither were green.  And though I could not tell how high up this was.  The intensity of the green light makes me think that it was not as high as the stars, possibly in the higher parts of our atmosphere. That's my gut feeling.   Did I see a alien ship? I t's a possibility.;42.1029635258357;-72.5717899696044
Three cone shaped lights rotating steadily every three seconds they meet in the center where another dimmer light is located.;2012-12-20 18:31:00;still occuring;Three cone shaped lights rotating steadily every three seconds they meet in the center where another dimmer light is located. Laying down in bed messing with my phone then in the corner of my eye I see a light dipping in and out.  Of course I turn to my window to actually see what it is and well there are 3 cone shaped lights spinning in a full circle then then all meet in the center about every three or four seconds, in the center how ever is yet another light that is dimmer than the others.   The event is actually still going on as I type this, no sound or anything.  Funny thing is this is not my first encounter with this about two months ago there was a single spinning light that resembled what a medalion would look like if spun it always followed the same path at the same height.   Even before that how ever me and some friends saw what appeared to be to be like a Phoenix in the sky then it simply disappeared as some planes came by its loaction, not long after it randomly appeared again before rising steadily and disappearing in a flash.;42.1029635258357;-72.5717899696044
((HOAX??))  Young man and woman are awakened by a loud humming sound they are pressed down in their bed.;2013-01-07 02:10:00;2-4 minutes;Young man and woman are awakened by a loud humming sound they are pressed down in their bed. Telephoned Report:  A young man reported that he and his fiancee had been awakened by a strange humming sound, which appeared to be emanating from directly over their residence. They looked out the window of their bedroom, and were shocked by how bright it was in their yard.  Also, he reported, they both felt &quotpressed down&quot in their bed, and they found themselves unable to move. ((NUFORC Note:  The source of the telephoned report sounded to us to be seemingly quite eloquent and responsible, but he has failed to submit a follow-up report.  We have telephoned him on approximately half a dozen occasions, and each time, he has stated that he would submit a report.  However, he has failed to do so, over the course of nearly four weeks.  Possible hoax??  PD));42.1029635258357;-72.5717899696044

It was a white light about 20 thousand feet moving across the sky making no noise.   It moved from one part of the sky to another in a matter of seconds and back again for 5 minutes then vanished.

Bright light fell from the sky.;2017-05-15 22:00:00;45 seconds;Bright light fell from the sky. I had gone outside with my boyfriend to have a smoke and look at the stars on a clear night as we usually do.   We had quickly noticed a satellite, about 5 planes flying around some higher then others (which I found strange that there was so many planes in just that one section of the sky) and then there was this very bright light in the sky almost like a really big star, just a bright white light no color, flashing, sound or any visible form.  It wasn't twinkling or moving but it stood out from all the other stars out that night like it didn't fit in.   All of the sudden, about 30-45 seconds of us noticing it, it dropped straight down like it was landing possibly in the distance, there was no trail that came off of it no sound, no shake from impact as if it was a crash.  Just a bright big star that fell from the sky in a very odd way.;42.1029635258357;-72.5717899696044
10 plus orange lights seen in Springfield, MA;2019-12-08 17:25:00;2 minutes;10 plus orange lights seen in Springfield, MA I noticed about 3 bright orange lights in the sky in East Springfield area looking towards Chicopee. With in 10-15 seconds of seeing the first lights about five more appeared in very close formation. The lights were bright and sold orange color, there were no flashing strobes as you would normally see in aircraft. The lights then turned towards the north and stared to fade. As the lead would fade out another light became visible at the tail end of the formation. I witnessed this for roughly 2 minutes and there were around 10-15 total.;42.1029635258357;-72.5717899696044
