Missing time with triangular craft.;1994-06-30 23:00:00;20 minutes;MIssing time with Triangular craft I was returning to my mother's house late from visiting with friends. My two teenage children were at home with her, so I was alone in the car.  Coming down Parker Street, which is a suburban area, I started going past part of the golf course on the left.  There are many trees here and the night was dark although there are streetlamps.  I was compelled to slow down the car (windows were open) and look over to the left as I pulled over to the curb.  There were no other cars on the road, which is strange for even this late hour as Parker Street is a main four-lane throughway.  I know the radio was on, but cannot recall any music playing just before, during or after the incident.   I realized that hovering directly over the treetops (maybe 40' at the most as they are predominantly maples) was an immense black triangle. No lights, but it blocked all stars and ambient lighting from the surrounding area so that it was like dense black velvet. It was silent.   As soon as I recognized it as a UFO, I recall nothing else until I was pulling away from the curb and driving on my way home.  I had a hard time understanding why I had been pulled over in the first place and struggled to recall.   A few moments later it came back to me what I had seen.  Then I heard the music playing, looked at the car clock realizing I was missing 18 minutes of time.  I cannot recall the exact timing but I do recall the 18 minutes as the number 18 is a lifelong pattern of synchronicity. I had to laugh at that one!   I told my mom when I got back to the house about what had happened. Her reaction was, It doesn't surprise me! (UFO's are a known 4-generation experience for us!) ((NUFORC Note:  Date in 1994 is approximate.  We have assigned an artificial date above.  We have requested that the witness attempt to try to recall the exact date.

Lots of details about three orange lights springfield, mass. Heard you on coast to coast, freaked out.;2010-07-04 21:30:00;at least five minutes;Lots of details about three orange lights springfield, mass. Heard you on coast to coast, freaked out. I was heading towards downtown Springfield for the fireworks.  I was traveling west and was stuck in traffic for aprox. five minutes.  The fireworks began at 9:30pm, but I saw the lights around around 9:25pm.  The fireworks were north of me, and the light were south of me. There were three distinctively orange lights in triangular formation, but moved in a oscillating fashion.  I was screaming at people on the sidewalk from my car to look over the highway, but no one would look...it was ridiculous.  These light were not that high in the sky hovering over the Connecticut River,  I'm talkin maybe a thousand feet off the ground....maybe more. maybe less don't know the exact calculations.  Sorry no photos or video from my end, but there were lots of cameras around that night. maybe call channel 22, channel 40, or channel 3 for footage from elevated positions shooting south over I-91 south.  They were no more than a half mile from the memorial bridge, where the fireworks! were being held, and they were definately in our lower atmosphere.;42.1029635258357;-72.5717899696044
