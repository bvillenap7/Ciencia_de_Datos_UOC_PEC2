Large cigar craft traveling at high speed and low altitude.;2010-11-02 19:15:00;Under 10 seconds;Large cigar craft traveling at high speed and low altitude. I was walking home form a convenience store on a side street heading north.  A motion in the sky caught my attention.  I looked up and I saw this craft. It was between 150 to 250 feet long.  There were small white lights on it from front to back. My guess is that there were between 10 and 15 lights. They appeared to be moving although I didn't observe the craft long enough to give a description as to how they moved.  From my angle of view this object appeared to be cigar in shape. The craft was traveling east to west in a straight line at an altitude of around 500 feet.  The speed of this craft was incredible.  The only way I can describe it is supersonic. It went from horizon to horizon in 5 to 10 seconds.  Trailing behind this craft was a strange vapor trail. It glowed with a sickly white-green color. It reminded me of the Aurora Borealis, the way it seemed to shimmer and move. The intensity of the vapor was very asymmetrical, the most concentration was closest to! the back of the craft and then quickly faded away. The most unnerving aspect about this whole sighting for me was that this craft made no noise what so ever. I live near Westover Air Force Base, and you can hear the planes WAY before you see them.;42.1029635258357;-72.5717899696044

The height or level of flight appears to be well over what commercial and fighter planes fly.  My guess is whenever I see them they are well into 100,000 plus feet into what I would consider outer space, the level of the stars!   My first sighting was in P.R. while on vacation ( spinning wheel like fire approached where I was staying and then made a fast 90 degree turn and thrusted away extremely fast) that was Nov. 2011.  Between late June 2012 through 7-24-12 I have seen many things in the sky on a nightly basis which I firmly believe with witnesses to be UFO's meaning objects that I cannot identify.  I have over 8 other eywitnesses who have seen them with me and without me being present. What I seen between 7-4 through 7-24-12 are starlike objects, silent while traveling and at times pulse activity with the object. On 7-24-12 after leaving a store I pointed! out to my friend in Springfield, Ma North of an area near a town called Ludlow, Ma, a long shaped cigar shape with lights all across.  The object floated silently, dropped and then disappeared.   That same evening which was 12:30 a.m. I drove home quickly in an attempt to find the object but it was gone. Then I decided to star gaze as I been doing for the past month.  I invited another friend over my home who had a close encounter on 7-4-12 of orange spheres with over 15 people as witneses.  He now is more interested in the night sky since his experience.   He seen a bright starlike light with me that hovered for over two hours changing colors from white, green, blue, orange. It then switched positions to another location in the sky.  During my observing the bright starlike object changing color I seen high in the sky a light coasting across the night sky extremely high with pulsing light.  A second one appeared doing the samething heading east as the other was heading west.  This h! as been a regular occurance EVERY NIGHT there is a clear sky.   My wife seen this and dismissed it as a hig plane. However after her 4th sighting she says she thinks its something different.;42.1029635258357;-72.5717899696044
