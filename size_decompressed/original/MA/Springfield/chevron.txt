Very big no sound;1997-06-01 21:00:00;4 minutes;very big no sound a friend and i were outside looking at a U.F.O. chevron shape dark and very big moving slow like it should have fell out of the sky but that had to be due to the huge size of the craft.   what we noticed that stood out was the lack of sound.  there was no sound.   my friend quickly called some more people to go out to there yard so they could see it as well. at least i had him with me because it just made know sense.;42.1029635258357;-72.5717899696044
