My boyfriend and I went onto my porch to have a cigarette and I always watch the sky, when I looked up I saw this craft that hovered right above the tree line.  It didn't move k until an airplane flew by and it looked like the craft slowly descended then once the plane passed the craft slow ascended to its original position.;42.1029635258357;-72.5717899696044
2 bright white lights change shape than color before vanishing;2015-11-16 16:30:00;30 minutes;2 bright white lights change shape than color before vanishing A co-worker and I stepped outside of work to have a cigarette and we both noticed to bright white lights in north west sky just before sunset.  I wondered if they could be stars but I could see no other stars out and they seemed too bright to be stars especially while the sun was still partly out.   About 10 minutes go by and we noticed the two bright circles in the sky began to change shape from circles to diamonds and they slowly started moving to the left at the same time. Than they stopped and started to change to a dark reddish color.   About 10 minutes go I after that and I start to notice the two lights that were super bright this whole time are starting to slowly dim down.  This lasted about 5 minutes untill they just vanished away out of thin air.right after the objects vanished we watched a couple jets head towards where the objects were. it was one of the craziest things I ever saw and im glad I had two other people witness it with me.;42.1029635258357;-72.5717899696044
