UFO flashing lights;2012-10-27 23:00:00;~2 minutes;ufo flashing lights It was not so long ago. I was with my 3 cousins making plans for the weekend when all of a sudden my cousin points out 2 or 3 shining dots that made a triangle shape.  It just hovered and we kept asking each other if it's possible for a plane to hover.  Then i started thinking if there are even planes shaped like that. Next thing you know, one by one the dots flew away FAST.  They flew away like 5 seconds apart but when they did, the sky lit up. It was creepy.  I'm certain others have seen it, but our community is filled with people who just don't care or assume they are fireworks.  Others would rather keep the info to themselves.  Me, I have to share an experience like this.;42.1029635258357;-72.5717899696044
