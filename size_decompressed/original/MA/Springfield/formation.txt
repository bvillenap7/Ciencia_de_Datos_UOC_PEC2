I told my wife to look up and she also wittnessed it. They flew right above us and disappeared to the other side of horizon. My estimate of their distance is 1,000 ft. It was clear star-lit sky. There was no sound coming from these objects. I called 911, the police and the close by Westover Airforce Base but nobody took me too seriously.;42.1029635258357;-72.5717899696044
November  8 Lights over Massachusetts;2003-11-09 00:30:00;2 Minutes;November  8 Lights over Massachusetts I happened to hear the gentleman who runs this site on a segment on Coast to Coast AM Saturday night (early Sunday 11/15) and heard the witnesses describe the sightings from over New England the night of the 8th.  It was this that stirred my memory about that evening. I was DJing a benefit for a local soldier injured in Iraq and finished packing my gear about 11:45 pm on that night.  I stayed for a drink afterward and headed out about 12:15-12:30 AM.  While at a stoplight I looked up at the moon and saw a light, which I thought was a plane.  I did a double-take because I then noticed the light was part of a V of very faint lights, maybe 7 or 8 on each 'wing' of the V. The V was not too wide and appeared nearly as a single line.  It was very difficult to see against the ambient city lighting.  The traffic light changed to green and I proceeded, I looked up again but could not locate the lights.  I thought it was odd but since there is a major air reserve base in the next town- which happens to be fairly active at this time of war- as well as an international airport close, I passed it off as an odd reflection or trick of the eyes.  I was heading in a southeasterly direction at the time.  As I said, had I not heard the Coast to Coast piece, I would never had thought any furthr of what I saw.;42.1029635258357;-72.5717899696044
1 large light  center, 3 lights on either side  1 additional light off to right side, width of 5 c-5 aircrafts side by side.;2008-01-08 05:00:00;2 minutes;1 large light  center, 3 lights on either side  1 additional light off to right side, width of 5 c-5 aircrafts side by side. At 5:00am on January 8, 2008 I stepped outside to get a.m. newspaper and looked up when I heard a low droning noise above.  Sound was much lower than typical aircraft that pass over, and not as loud as jets or c-5 aircraft that I am familiar with hearing.  The morning sky was crystal clear as was evident when a shooting star passed directly under the object I saw and was very bright, and there were many stars out.  An object was approaching from the west and moving toward south east.  The object above looked to be approximately the width of five C-5 aircraft and was moving very slowly.  I saw one large central light, that appeared to have more than one color and on either side of the center light there were 4 smaller lights, spaced out at regular intervals of perhaps 200 ft  between and 1 light off the right side set back and apart from the rest.  All moved at the same uniform speed while approaching me and moving over me.  The lights were dim, as if behind a cloud, although there appeared to be no clouds in the area.  I assumed it was very high in the sky.  I cannot estimate height, but from where I stood it appeared to be the width above mentioned.  I was unable to see a distinct form of airplane(s), only the light formations.  I initially though that perhaps this was a large aircraft with jets flying on the sides in formation, however, the object remained in the same configuration while it passed over me, and after passing directly over the 8 lights on either side of the main central light started to change configuration in that they circled around each other, but remained at the same speed as the object.   I then thought that there were no way these were jets flying in formation because the lights could not have circled around each other.  They continued to do this until they were too far off in the horizon for me to see.;42.1029635258357;-72.5717899696044
