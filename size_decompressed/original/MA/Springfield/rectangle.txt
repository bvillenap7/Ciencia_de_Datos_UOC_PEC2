Summer of '78, Springfield, MA, a display of colors on a screen hovering above us.;1978-08-15 20:00:00;2-3 minutes;Summer of '78, Springfield MA, a display of colors on a screen hovering above us My teenaged friends and myself witnessed the event from the pool located on Dickinson St., Springfield, MA.  Other people present included residents of the complex.   We were just taking advantage of their pool on a hot summer night.  What we saw looked like a movie screen shaped object, most definitely a rectangle.  It was silent, stopped above us at a height of about 2-300 feet and stayed motionless above us, but running through a number of beautiful colors.  Some of us panicked, but I was just generally curious about this event.   After just an minute or two, it slowly and silently retreated in no particular rush.   That's it, just a rectangular screen about 50 ft x 100 ft producing an incredible display of colors from across the spectrum.   I was never affected physically or mentally (i hope!) and made for an interesting, once in a lifetime experience.;42.1029635258357;-72.5717899696044
 it ran through colors like I have never seen;1979-08-01 22:00:00;2-3 minutes; it ran through colors like I have never seen This event took place about 10pm. I was pool-hopping with some friends at the Georgetown Apts. pool, after hours. We noticed a light in the sky, more of a square shape then a rectangle. The object made no sound and appeared to be at least a hundred feet or more above us. It stopped above us, causing some of my friends to panic (to my amusement!). It hovered above us and ran through colors like I have never seen before. It seemed to be somekind of screen. Then it went back the way that it came and that was the end of it! Once again, we heard no sound at all, and there was really no road noise to speak of. We had all admitted to what we had seen and never persued it, but I have never forgotten it.

I can see the stars about a group of what looked like about 12 stars moving the opposite direction of the clouds.  At first I thought i was looking as Orion's belt but it started to move.   I keep my eyes on the stars it was cloudy but could see that the stars or lights was moving the lights moving evenly spaced and i could see something the shape of a rectangle moving.;42.1029635258357;-72.5717899696044
