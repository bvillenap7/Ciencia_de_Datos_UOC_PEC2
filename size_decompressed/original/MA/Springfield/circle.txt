I was on patrol of a property in ((city deleted)), Ma, On ((street name deleted)) st. It was a very cloudy day, with large dark clouds. Storm clouds. I was always drawn to looking to the sky. I had made several patrols inside and outside, but continued to have a strange feeling. I went outside once again and for no reason I looked up. I saw a red round object hoovering in front of a storm cloud. After a few seconds it began to bob up and down then circled around the clouds. It started slow then got faster and faster. I heard no sound. I kept looking and the object, it took off into the clouds never to be seen again. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));42.1029635258357;-72.5717899696044
We noticed it had gotten smaller out of nowhere, but was still at the same distance.;2005-04-09 00:00:00;1 min or less;Happend around 3:45 pm (I'm having trouble putting it in the above slot) Was driving on the highway in Springfield MA heading towards W.Springfield with my sister, when we both noticed something silver in the sky to the right of us. Wasn't a baloon or a blimp and wasn't moving. I had her stay focused on it as I was driving and I would glimpse back when I could. We noticed it had gotten smaller out of nowhere, but was still at the same distance. I looked away and then back about a second later to see that it was gone.;42.1029635258357;-72.5717899696044

At approximately 21:40,as we looked out our 4th floor window facing the north, we witnessed at least 40 circular orange-red lights (all separate), coming up out of the north-westerly direction and seemed to bank to the north and disappear.   These objects were simultaneously appearing, then floating in linear pattern, then disappearing into the north.   We counted at least 40, seeing approximately 5 at a time, in the sky at once. this incident lasted approximately 20 minutes.;42.1029635258357;-72.5717899696044
3 white lights circling in formations around 1 big white light.;2014-02-27 20:30:00;~5 minutes;3 white lights circling in formations around 1 big white light. There was 1 big very bright white light in the shape of a circle behind the clouds.   Then there were 3 bright smaller white lights (not as bright as the big light) that were circling in formations around the big light behind the clouds.   Then the 3 smaller lights seemed to disappear behind the big light.   Then the big light slowly started to fade away.   I came out side again about an hour later and the clouds were gone and so were the lights.   We tried taking video but it is very hard to see.  We are trying to brighten it up then we will send it in.;42.1029635258357;-72.5717899696044
