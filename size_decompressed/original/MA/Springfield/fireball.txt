Slow moving falling satr at 30 degree angle west to east;2004-03-15 19:27:00;12 seconds;Slow moving falling satr at 30 degree angle west to east while waking my dog at aprox. 7:27 pm I saw what I first thought was a meteor. It was moving at a 30 degree angle from the West to the East It was very bright and moving much slower than the falling stars that I usually see. Surely someone else must have seen it? I do not know much about meteors. Can they seem to be going slower if they are very large?;42.1029635258357;-72.5717899696044
