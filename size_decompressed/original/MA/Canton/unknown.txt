At first I thought it was a military helicopter because it had a certain amount of  bass to it, but as it got louder I came to the conclusion this was no helicopter.  The pitch didn’t change like a helicopter would have as it moved closed, and its bass increased also.   While listening to this strange noise for about 1 minute or so I then started to think that it was some ones car stereo, however the sound never changed its rhythm during the entire time.  Observing the only possible routes a car could take into and out of neighborhood no cars were seen.   This noise also seemed to take a path that could only be taken in the air.  After several minutes of my curiosity being peaked I thought to myself I’m going out and see what the hell is making this strange noise.  At this exact moment I could feel this slight pressure all over my body and felt somewhat off balance.  This freaked me out enough to say the hell with it and stay parked firmly in front of the TV, and allow this sound to pass over without  me investigating further.
