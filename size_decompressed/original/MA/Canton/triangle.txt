Traveling south RT 95 and observed bright lights west of RT 95 in Canton;2000-02-08 05:15:00;5 minutes;Traveling south RT 95 and observed bright lights west of RT 95 in Canton I was traveling south on RT 95 in Canton,Mass when I saw a bright light off to the west of my location,I traveled for 3 miles watching the light At first I thought it must be a plane and keeped my eye on it,after 2 miles something told me to pull over into the breakdown lane to watch, as it passed overhead just in front of my truck I noticed that the lights were not setup like a planes. There were 10 lights all which were yellow/white in color 2 of the 10 lights were strobe lights color blue at the rear middle of the craft, lights were located on the 3 corners and located at the bottom middle of the craft 2 in the front side by side and 3 at the bottom middle side by side across the back. As it passed in front of my truck I rolled down the window and stuck my head out to look closer and heard not a sound and this craft was at a height that when I extended my arm out at the craft my hand just covered it, a jet plane at this height would have been loud but no noise. It traveled about 10 miles in about 2 minutes from RT 1A in walpole to RT 138 Stoughton.;42.1648;-71.1379
