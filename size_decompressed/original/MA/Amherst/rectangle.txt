Drum like Object with Vertical Rectangle Light Panels.;1985-09-30 06:00:00;less than 10 seconds;Drum like Object with Vertical Rectangle Light Panels My experience happened in the fall of 1985 at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. It was either a mild late summer or fall early morning with a bit of fog. It was just after day break.  I was walking along the campus center pond when I looked up over my shoulder to see what appeared to be a rotating like drum/cylinder that was defined by vertical rectangles of light.  Nothing else defined the object but the rectangles of light.    The size of the light panels were maybe 10 feet wide by 15 feet tall.  The drum was rotating in a right to left stop and go motion if I remember correctly.  It was a silent moving rotating object that stayed in place as it sat on top of the fog above the pond.  The UFO lasted for a few seconds and seemed to just fade out in place. I looked about to see if there were any other people walking that morning on campus but there were not. I was alone.  I remember just having a sense of curiosity and wonder, but no emotions of fear or concern at what I saw.;42.3705046153846;-72.4787769230769
