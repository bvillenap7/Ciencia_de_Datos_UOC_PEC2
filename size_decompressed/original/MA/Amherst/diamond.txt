Huge silent flying object moving North East in the sky.;2013-10-28 21:00:00;10 minutes;Huge silent flying object moving North East in the sky. On the night of Oct. 28,2013 I witnessed what I believe to be a UFO flying in a North East direction at about 9:00 pm.  It caught my attention because of its size and how low it was over the roof top of the house.  I estimate its size to be bigger than a full moon and I liken its shape to be diamond like.  It had lights along the tips and partial perimeter.  I tried chasing it to get a picture but was obscured by tree line and street lights.  I chased it for about 10 min. but lost it.   I also mention that there was no engine noise.  I rolled my window down to see if it was an airplane but it was absolutely quiet.;42.3705046153846;-72.4787769230769
