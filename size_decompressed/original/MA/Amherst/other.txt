Glowing boomerang shaped object, hovering for 2 1/2 minutes;2002-12-16 15:30:00;2 1/2 minutes;Glowing boomerang shaped object, hovering for 2 1/2 minutes I saw a craft shaped like a boomerang and it was hovering about 100 feet above the tree tops. It was a glowing pale orange-yellow. The only color that I can think of that comes close is the color of a flame.  The color seemed to have a fluid movement like when looking at a flame too. I was in my car and came upon this object, and I stoped the car to look at it.  It stayed there for about two and a half minutes and then just seemed to blink out. Just like some one turning off a light.  This is not the first time that I have seen strange things in the sky, but this was the first time that I had fear in my heart over it.  There was no reason that I could understand, for the feelings of fear, but the feeling was there just the same. A great deal of fear. This object made no sound at all. I don't remember the exact date, but I do know it was about 7 to 9 days before christmas. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));42.3705046153846;-72.4787769230769
