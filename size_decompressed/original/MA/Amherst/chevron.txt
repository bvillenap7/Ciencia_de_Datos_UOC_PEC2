I am a 20-year-old college student.  At approximately 7:15 pm eastern time, I was driving with my girlfriend on Bay Road in Belchertown Massachusetts right near the border with Amherst.  We were near the Cold Spring Self storage facility heading east when we saw bright lights overhead.  At first, I thought it was a plane but as it got closer it didnâ€™t seem like any plane I had ever heard of.  It was dark, but from what I could make it appeared to be a black triangle or diamond shape flying maybe 100 feet above us.  It crossed over the road heading from North to South. From our vantage point, it looked slightly larger than a full moon.  We opened the window and there was no sound at all even though the aircraft seemed to be so close.  All we could hear was the wind from us driving.  There were bright flashing white lights that outlined the triangle shape and then there were also flashing red and green lights on the bottom of the craft.  We attempted to take a! video.  It then seemed to speed up very quickly and got smaller and smaller until it disappeared over the treeline.;42.3705046153846;-72.4787769230769
