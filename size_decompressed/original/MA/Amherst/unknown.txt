Flashing Lights, Changing colors, Amherst;2013-09-22 02:30:00;1 hour;Flashing Lights, Changing colors, Amherst At approximately 2:30am my friend and I noticed several bright green lights flash outside of her window. Looking like they came from the sky.  We briefly ignored the bright green flashes assuming they were just a weird tint/minds playing tricks on us about lightning. Afterwards, we noticed several red flashes as well (each flash lasting in about 6 or 8 second periods). We went outside to check, and asked several people if they saw the lights, and they saw them as well, and the lights changed to a bright yellow, and seemed to originate past the W.E. dubois library at center of campus. It was consistent flashing. I asked if maybe they were fireworks, but it was raining, and it was flashing too much to be a fireworks show. And a firework at 2:30 in the morning makes no sense.;42.3705046153846;-72.4787769230769
Two very large bursts of light, in rapid succession.;2016-11-06 02:30:00;5 seconds;Two very large bursts of light, in rapid succession. When I looked out a large window, the sky was very dark (window looks out on several miles of open fields, with low hills, the Pelham range in the distance).  There were two bursts of light that occurred in very rapid succession.  They seemed to appear from just on the other side of the hills and were impressively large.  It was a quiet night here, no noise was audible, and that seemed to be it.  Given the distance from the occurrence though, this had to be something major, yet I can find no instance of an explosion or accident.;42.3705046153846;-72.4787769230769
Flashing Blue light changing to red/white, changed direction quickly.;2017-01-11 17:01:00;<30 seconds;Flashing Blue light changing to red/white, changed direction quickly. The object was a blue flashing light ascending rather quickly above the tree line.  It stopped in midair for about 2 seconds then proceeded to move forward at which point the flashing blue light changed to flashing red and white.   After a few seconds the object stopped and began to ascend again slowly and the lights faded out as it went into the cloud layer.  Local weather reports listed the ceiling at 21000-23000 ft..;42.3705046153846;-72.4787769230769
