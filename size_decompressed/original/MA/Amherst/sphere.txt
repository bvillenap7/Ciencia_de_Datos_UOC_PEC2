There was a tree line about 50 yards to 75 yards ahead of me, and about 20 feet above that, appeared a green circle very bright with no back light shining on any of the trees and it looked like it was divided into four sections with for green lights and it shot straight past the tree line where I couldn't see it the occurrence only happened roughly 5 seconds but it was very vivid and very easy to describe because it was that close to me;42.3705046153846;-72.4787769230769
