Oject left a fire trail below it, could not be identified.;2003-09-20 16:30:00;1 second;Oject left a fire trail below it, could not be identified. No one actually saw this craft we were taking pictures from our dorm room balcony on the UMass Amherst Campus, with a digital camera.  We took about 10 pictures and we have only one w/ this craft that appears to have a jet below it w/ fire. I have abosolutley no idea what it is or could be and I was just looking for an explanation.  I just got a copy of the picture yesterday wand peaked my interest in it and I just thought i should report just to get an idea of what it might be.  So if any one at this website would liek to see the picture i would love to share it and maybe get some answers. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));42.3705046153846;-72.4787769230769
