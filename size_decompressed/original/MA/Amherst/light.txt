Multi-colored lights, upper atmosphere, redshift anomaly, star UFO;2009-08-15 03:00:00;2 Hours;Multi-colored lights, upper atmosphere, redshift anomaly, star UFO At approximately 3am - 5am EST 3 young adults observed 15+ lights in the upper atmosphere with video camera and telescope.  They appeared to resemble stars at first but ultimately shifted in color and position unlike normal celestial bodies.  They seem to be constantly in their relative positions but bounce in the sky when zoomed in upon.  In addition, while observing these lights in the sky strange points and flashes of light were noticed above the trees and closer to our group, some as shooting stars with curved tails.  Two members of this sighting team are members of independent paranormal research collaborations.;42.3705046153846;-72.4787769230769
