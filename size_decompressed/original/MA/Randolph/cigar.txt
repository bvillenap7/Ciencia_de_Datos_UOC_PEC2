Possible Tomahawk Missile;2008-11-12 16:10:00;2 sec;Possible Tomahawk Missile I and three additional friends were on our way to New Hampshire for the weekend. I was sitting in the front passenger seat while my girl friend drove. The other two sat in the rear. The craft was traveling at extreme speeds so it was difficult to see any real detail. The best description I could give was something like a Tomahawk missile. I was a police officer in the Air Force for ten years and have a great deal of experience surrounding air craft. The craft traveled from right to left across the highway (US 93). The terrain dropped to my right and rose to the left. I was fortunate to see it as it approached. My girl friend witnessed it as it passed to her front and above. If it was not a Tomahawk, (which is what I could have sworn it was) I have no idea what it was. The size was difficult to determine again due to the speed, but the fact I witnessed it and judging from the road and surrounding area I would speculate it was the same size as a Tomahawk or larger, most likely larger (it is difficult to see a Tomahawk at full speed passing directly in front of you). I looked at my girlfriend and she at me. She said what he fuck was that? I did not want to poison her thought process and simply asked her what she saw. She thought she saw a missile and kept asking me why would a missile be going over the highway and where is going and so on. I explained I did not know any of that and told her maybe it was a test rocket or such. To this day it troubles me whatever it was. I have seen many craft public and secret and the fact it was traveling over a U.S. highway bothers me the most. Anyway this is first time I have ever participated in such a public forum. Due the current state of affairs in this area I felt compelled to share.;42.1755;-71.0540000000001
