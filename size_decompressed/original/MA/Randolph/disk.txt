I was driving on 95s heading down to the Cape.  As I was driving about 75-80, I looked up at that sky and saw a disk with a hole in the middle, silver and shiny and thin.  The way that it was moving across the sky (and it wasn't very big) it reminded me of a frisbee that was thrown sloppy.  I have no idea what the hell this thing was.;42.1755;-71.0540000000001
