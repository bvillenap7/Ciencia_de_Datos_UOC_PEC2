Two black objects slowly came into view in the sky, the other parent and I with our kids (4 witnesses) noticed them, flying spaced apart but in tandem at a steady pace in high altitude just about the cloud lines and dipped in and out of the clouds on their course, flying from the Southwest to Northeast, heading toward Boston. The two unknown objects were seemingly large and may have had large wings slowly flapping but from a distance from each other, like they were following each other. They must have been quite large. A commercial jet appeared and came into view half way though this event. The Commercial jet flew quite high in the distance but was lower, not in the clouds, that gave me/us a sense of the fairly large size to compare them to, But the two black objects were not as big and fast moving as the commercial airplane. It was odd. There was no tail and did not look li! ke a airplane. Very bizarre. I thought to myself it could have been some sort of angelic black creature or being with wings, but not white like an angel. I have no idea what we we saw.;42.2802999999999;-71.25
