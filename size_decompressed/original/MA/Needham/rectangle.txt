Needham, MA event.  (NUFORC Note:  Probably local aircraft.  PD));2005-09-10 22:45:00;5 MINUTES;Needham, MA event My husband called me into our living room, which has a large west view of MA's skyline.  He said he noticed a very strong light, low, that was moving very slow.   When he went outside on our deck to look closer, he said it moved a little to the left and it kept changing in intensity.   He called me out and we watched the light and suddenly, it moved towards our house and I looked at it quite critically, as since we are at the highest point in our town, we are used to small planes and helicopters over our house.  This had no noise and resembled neither.  When it passed over the house, it had a light configuration that we had never seen--a rectangular one, behind a very bright lead light light.  The object flew over our house and then disappeared, only to reappear a few minutes later to the east, and then disappear before it would have logically gone over our home. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with one of the witnesses, and both of them now believe that the lights they witnessed probably were from aircraft taking off from, and landing at, a local airport, used by light aircraft.
