Star- looking, awkward moving, 3 lighted ufo.;2006-05-27 22:35:00;20 minutes and ongoin;Star- looking, awkward moving, 3 lighted ufo. I looked about mid horizon/above me. I saw what looked to be just a regular star. Although, blinking. Its is a combanation of 3 stars clumped together. I have been looking at it, and as my witnesses left, it started to move slightly, like trying to message me, as it moved, it made what looked like to be shapes. It moved at a steady rate, then returned to a state of rest. Although it looked originally like a star, it moved, and in too awkward a shape to be a satalite.  There is what seems like a trail of light. Im still looking at it as i type this, and it still moves ocoasionally.;42.3935000000001;-71.1836000000001
