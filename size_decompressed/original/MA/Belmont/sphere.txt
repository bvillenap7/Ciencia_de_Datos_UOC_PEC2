Red fast-moving orb;2016-05-10 20:30:00;30 seconds;Red fast-moving orb Object seen in sky on clear night, circular and reddish colored.  Looked like airplane red lights, but had no accompanying blink or white/blue light as you typically see with aircraft and it made no noise.   As I watched it moved left to right across the sky, then did a quick swing back to the left, and then out of view to the north.
