follow up on a 3 light ufo, awkwardly moving.;2006-05-27 23:15:00;30 minutes;follow up on a 3 light ufo, awkwardly moving. i submited a previous report, about 5 minutes ago, but recently, after i spoke to a representative from washington i believe, the ufo began moving at a staedy pace to the right. I figured it must have just been  a statlite, but at that moment, it moved awkardly backwards, diagonally. It was much more visible before, but no i have to lean out of my porch to see it. It is what looks like 3 star clumped to form a triangle. It is no bigger than your fingernail, a full arms length away. It has changed colors, but in very long timespans. It went from whioth saw it and belive it is te, to red, blue and green light. It has what seems to be a trail of light connected to it. MY dad and siter both saw it and agree that it is a ufo. I triangulated its position, and it seems to be above me, a little bit closer to the horizon.;42.3935000000001;-71.1836000000001
