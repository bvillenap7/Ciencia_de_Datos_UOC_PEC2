Object with bright light and blue/green tint moves rapidly and silently through Belmont;2015-04-01 22:45:00;seconds;Object with bright light and blue/green tint moves rapidly and silently through Belmont At around 10:45 PM on Wednesday, April 1, I was laying on my couch in the living room looking outside the front window and saw a very bright light, with a faint blue/green tint surrounding, move rapidly behind my neighbor’s houses across the street.   From the angle I was looking out my window, this object could have been miles away, but definitely looked much closer.   The roundish object moved horizontally in a fairly straight line from SW to W.  I only saw the object for a second or two since the opening between my neighbor’s houses is only 25-30 feet.   The object didn’t have any tail behind it as it passed and didn’t make any sound that I could hear. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness.  He sounded to us to be quite serious-minded, and we suspect that he is a very good witness.  PD));42.3935000000001;-71.1836000000001
