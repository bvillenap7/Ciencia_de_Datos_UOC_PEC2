We saw 6 objects moving silently and slightly erratically from west to east.  They all started out appearing from below the horizon in the west, rising upward then turning to the east.   Appeared to move in a sweeping arch toward the east and not in a straight line like a plane.  Their color varied from light orange to dark orange and one almost appeared to be on fire.   I had my camera and zoomed in as much as I could and saw that they were all spheres, almost like small suns.  Their speed was not constant but varied and one moved side to side while moving westward.  One also was very close to another one but did not touch.  No sound at all yet they seemed to be fairly close to us.   Lasted about 10 minutes in all.  First three appeared, then two then one by itself, all traveled in the same direction.   When I zoomed in I could see no wings or anything attached to the spheres, only the lit up spheres themselves.;41.9261;-71.3010999999999
