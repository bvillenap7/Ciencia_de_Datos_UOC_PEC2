A small globe of white light hovering over the grass paced my car for several minutes.;1997-10-19 02:00:00;10 minutes;A small globe of white light hovering over the grass paced my car for several minutes. I was driving southbound on interstate 95 in Attleboro.  At approximately 2:00AM I spotted a globe of white light pacing my car in the median between lanes just before exit 2B.  It was clearly visible through the driver's side window and hovered about two or three feet off the ground.   At first I thought it was a dirt bike or glare on the window, but when I rolled down the window, the light continued to pace me and it was clearly not a bike of any kind.  I looked out the windshield, then back in case it was a ghost image in my eyes from oncoming headlights, but it didn't move with my vision.   The light paced the car for about ten minutes. I slowed down to forty miles an hour and it slowed as well, still keeping pace.   I am very interested in finding out what it was. I am not a user of drugs and seldom drink.  I was not drinking at all that day or for many days prior.;41.9261;-71.3010999999999

I saw no aircraft marker lights.  The object was moving at a fast pace but was not faster than could be expected by conventional aircraft.  I lost site of the object over the horizon heading south from the north.;41.9261;-71.3010999999999
Curved blue light shot towards earth;2015-09-19 00:37:00;0.5 second;Curved blue light shot towards earth What I saw may have only been a shooting star or falling space debris.  A blue glow shot through the sky to my left, at such an angle that if it were small and close it could have impacted the earth within my town.   I listened and heard nothing, so I suppose it could have been larger and farther away than I assumed but there was no air burst or flash of light.  This leads me to believe it was a small piece of debris, had it  been a space shuttle in the distance it would have taken a less steep entry angle.   Knowing that UFOs can accelerate instantaneously I assume they can decelerate just as fast.  If the composition of said potential craft was hard and dense enough I suppose it may have completed it's journey whole.  From the center of Attleboro it appeared in the southern sky, towards Rhode Island.  The trail seen may have only been a streak of light caused by super heating.  The curved edge was about the size of the tip of a finger at arm's length.;41.9261;-71.3010999999999
