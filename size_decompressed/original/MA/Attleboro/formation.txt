faint triagle formation massachusetts rhode island;2003-07-04 23:30:00;2 minutes approx;faint triagle formation massachusetts rhode island appeared to be three crafts traveling south east resembing faint stars.  i stress, very faint. pyramid was an accute triangle, furthest point leading the pack. approx the size of tip of thumb to bottom nuckle for the hypotonous then connecting your other fore finger and index finger as the accure angle.  if my orientation was correct, they would be crossing over, onto the atlantic just south of the rhode island / massachusetts border.  what i found odd about the occurance was the speed and the formation being a far distance apart traveling at that altitude. i was atop a roof watching fireworks in a town called attleboro MA.  my wife and i laid staring up at the stars for a short time thereafter.  there were city lights, however many stars were visable, these lights were much more faint.  i logged onto passur.com for logan airport (boston) and saw no travel in that direction, let alone that formation.  curious however if passur.com would report non-commerical aircraft. never seen anything i felt was unidentifialbe in the sky before.  came home type in google report ufo and presto... this site. hope it has legs.

Occaisionally one will blink out, and dart across the sky into a different formation.  There seems to be one centralized light in the North, and to the west of that, at least 1 Triangle formation and 2 individual formations.;41.9261;-71.3010999999999
