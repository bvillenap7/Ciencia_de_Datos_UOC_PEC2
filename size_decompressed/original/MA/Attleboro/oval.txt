Two red/orange objects flying in synchronicity over Attleboro, Massachusetts 08/06/13;2013-08-06 21:40:00;3 minutes;Two red/orange objects flying in synchronicity over Attleboro, Massachusetts 08/06/13 I walked outside at approximately 9:40 pm on 08/06/13 and obsevered two redish orange glowing objects flying very low.  I observed them flying slowly heading North East for a few seconds then they appeared to stop and hover for about 20 seconds.  I thne noticed that my cell phone was not in my pocket so I ran back inside to get it and also called for my son. I never told him what I had just saw.  He ran outside with me.  They then in synchronicity continued traveling North West and on eof them abrupty started flying upward at a much higher rate of speed.  I then asked my son to desribe what he is seeing and he told me two dark orange glowing things flying in the sky.  The first object then flew upward and an extremely high rate of speed until it was not viewable then the second object did the same.  I didn't notice any sound from either object.  By the time I got the video camera on my cell phone to work they were gone.;41.9261;-71.3010999999999
