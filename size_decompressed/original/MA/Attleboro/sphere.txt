Looked up in the eastern sky and saw a spherical object approach, fly overhead and off into the distance.  Thought it could have been a mylar balloon but it didn't dance like a balloon would and it's rate of speed did not behave like a balloon.  There was no noise or lights.  Color of the object was silver and reflective.;41.9261;-71.3010999999999
