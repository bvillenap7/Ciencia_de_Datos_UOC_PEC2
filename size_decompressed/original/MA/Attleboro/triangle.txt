a very lowflying massive craft spotted during lunar eclipse;2003-11-08 19:30:00;30sec;a very lowflying massive craft spotted during lunar eclipse I was outside looking at the lunar eclipse. From the corner of my eye I saw what I thought at first were Canadian geese flying in formation. They were not geese, but a series of very dim lights outlining  the front part of a massive black, triangular aircraft. It was very quiet and very low. I watched it fly by slowly for a few seconds and quickly ran to get another witness when it was overhead. A split second later it had vanished. The shape of the craft was not a sharp-lined triangle, but had subtle indentations almost like  gigantic bird wings. It was extremely low, and almost completely silent except of a slight swishing sound when directly overhead. ((NUFORC Note:  Please see numerous other reports.  PD));41.9261;-71.3010999999999
