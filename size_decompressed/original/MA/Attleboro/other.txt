BOOMERANG OBJECT TRAVELING NORTH TO SOUTH OVER ATTLEBORO MASS.;2007-11-29 18:45:00;5 seconds;BOOMERANG OBJECT TRAVELING NORTH TO SOUTH OVER ATTLEBORO MASS. AT 6:45PM I OBSERVED A BOOMERANG SHAPED CRAFT FLY DIRECTLY OVERHEAD AS I WAS STANDING ON MY THIRD FLOOR APARTMENT PORCH HAVING A CIGARETTE.THERE WERE THREE SOFT RED CIRCULAR LIGHTS EVENLY SPACED ON EACH WING WITH A PURPLE COLORED MIST OR HAZE COMING OFF OF BACKSIDE OF THESE LIGHTS. THE WHOLE CRAFT SEEMED TO BE A SLIGHT VIOLET COLOR,BUT I SUPPOSE IT COULD HAVE BEEN A REFLECTION OF ITS OWN LIGHT SOURCE.A COLD FRONT HAD JUST GONE BY AND SKY WAS BASICALLY CLEAR EXCEPT FOR A FEW FAST MOVING WHISPY CLOUDS.I WISH I KNEW THE HEIGHT OF THE CLOUDS BECAUSE THE OBJECT SEEMED JUST ABOVE THIS LEVEL. MY GUESS ON HEIGHT OF OBJECTS FLIGHT PATH WOULD BE 500FT. TO 1 MILE.IT TRAVELED IN A STRAIGHT LINE. AT FIRST I WAS LOOKING AT THE STARS TOWARDS THE NE. THEN TO THE NORTH I CAUGHT IN VIEW WHAT I THOUGHT WAS GOING TO BE A SEARCHLIGHT BUT IT CONTINUED IN A STRAIHT LINE TOWARDS ME,WHITISH LIGHT AT FIST UNTIL DIRECTLY OVERHEAD THEN COULD MAKE OUT DETAILS AND COLOR THEN BACK TO WHITISH AS IT CONTINUED BY TOWARDS GREEN AIRPORT IN RHODE ISLAND.IT WAS THE SIZE OF A NEW PENCIL HELD OUT AT ARMS LENGTH(PROBABLY DOES NOT HELP DETERMINING ITS SIZE THOUGH).NO SOUND CAME FROM IT,I WAS TRULY AMAZED AND IN AWE,IT WAS WHAT IT WAS AND I HAD NEVER  SEEN SUCH A SIGHT.EVER SINCE THEN I AM TRYING TO COME UP WITH WAYS THAT SUGGEST IT WAS SOMETHING ELSE BUT CAN NOT DO SO.;41.9261;-71.3010999999999
