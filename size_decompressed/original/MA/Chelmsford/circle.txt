Bright light covered distance in seconds.;2005-12-14 05:48:00;5 seconds;Bright light covered distance in seconds. Travelling South on Route3 (Nashua NH to Lowell MA) just passed the exit for Route 40 and to the east a bright circle travelling at extream velocity and a very steep angle appeared, it was impossible to miss all vehicles on Route 3 slowed down. Route3 is a commuter road for Boston I use it to drop my wife at Lowell train station then return back to Nashua NH using Route3 north. When I started to approach the area of the earlier  sighting there was clearly way in the distance aircraft lights.  I exited Route 3 and stopped as the wind noise travelling at speed obscured any chance of hearing the aircraft.  After stopping the aircraft were clearly helicopters.
