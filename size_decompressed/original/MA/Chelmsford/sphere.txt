((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch at 2055 hrs (EDT).  PD))   Resembled what the ISS looks like when it went overhead one night;2005-04-29 21:00:00;1 minute;Resembled what the ISS looks like when it went overhead one night except less defined.  Sort of fuzzy.   This object seemed to come out of nowhere and travel in a direction the jets take heading overseas. (NE).  It was high in the SEast sky.   Moving quickly at first then almost seemed to stop. That caught my attention while walking the dog.  Then a jet at cruise altitude heading NE began to catch up on it.  The object was definately higher than the jet.  As the jet came closer the object sped up and withing 5 seconds sort of faded away.  Those pilot had to see this.   To sum up, it traveled at different speeds, seemed very high, came out of nowhere and disappeared into nowhere.  Strange! ((NUFORC Note:  We assume that the witness describes above the launch of a Titan IV missile out of Cape Canaveral, which occurred at 20:55 hrs. (Eastern) on this date.  The missile apparently was launched to the northeast, so it was visible along the eastern shoreline of the U. S..  PD));42.5945;-71.3571000000001
