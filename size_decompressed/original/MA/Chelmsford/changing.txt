Green comet like light.;2015-11-01 18:00:00;30 seconds;green comet like light I was driving on rt 3 north in Chelmsford ma and noticed a green light with a tail, first I thought It was a comet or a shooting star Because it was coming down so fast.   It formed into a ball and spilt into two balls and shot forward and vanished. I have no clue what it was but I wish I never saw it.   I was also with my mother and my four year old son everyone saw the same thing.;42.5945;-71.3571000000001
