Bright Light over 495 in Chelmsford MA;2010-09-07 19:30:00;10 minutes;Bright Light over 495 in Chelmsford MA While driving southbound on Route 495 the evening of Sept 7, 2010 in the Chelmsford, MA area I noticed a very bright, twinkling light very low in the sky.  The light was large and did not move but hovered in one spot. I watched the light for about 10 minutes and then it was gone!  It did not leave a trail or fly off. It was just gone!  About 5 seconds later it reappeared in the exact same spot.  I watched it until I had to turn onto Route 2 West. As I continued driving on Route 2 West I saw another one in the southern sky.  This one did not move either but hovered there twinkling very bright. It was low and quite large. The sun had not gone down yet â€“ there were no stars in the sky.  Plus it was so much bigger than a star. As I got closer to the Shirley Prison I saw two more appear in the North.  One was slightly higher than the other and to its North. It a very strange way, the higher object moved left to align itself directly on top of the lower one. There is no way this was a plane as they were very, very close to one another. There were no flashing lights as a plane has. These objects were twinkling bright. Like a giant disco ball. Once the two were aligned one above the other, they moved together to the right in one smooth motion and then they were behind the tree line and I lost sight of them. I was alone in the car and wished so badly to have someone to share this phenomenon with! Was I the only one to see it? This is my first experience with something like this and I have been driving this same route home for over 12 years!;42.5945;-71.3571000000001
