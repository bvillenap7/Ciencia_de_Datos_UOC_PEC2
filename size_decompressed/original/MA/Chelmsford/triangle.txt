A friend and I were going home and I took the route I generally took. I began to drive down a sidestreet, the street is at a 45 degree angle to the park, when I looked over to the park I noticed three bright lights over the treeline.  The lights were bright, but they weren't luminating the trees or ground.  I stopped the car and we observed the lights. Then before I realized it we were drive down the road toward my friends house.  We never really discussed what we saw that night, but when we do (three years later)my friend gets alittle defensive and denies seeing anything. After a few days of the incident I told my girlfriend at the time about what we saw, she told me not to discuss this in public(in fear that I would be considered crazy). Still to this day I wonder if anything happen to us, because it seems like time past and we back in the car driving like we normally did. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
