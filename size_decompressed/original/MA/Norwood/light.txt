bright blue-white light moving to fast and then gone?;2008-01-21 18:37:00;5 seconds;bright blue-white light moving to fast and then gone? We were driving down the local highway when the bright blue and white light caught our eyes in the sky straight ahead. It lasted for 5 to 7 seconds, what ever it was it was moving faster then anything Iâ€™ve seen. As we continued to drive north we noticed white smoke trail, about 2 miles long and no visible plane in sight.  The only logical thing I can think of is blue ice burning up from a much higher plane. I believe planes are not allowed to drop waste from the air?;42.1897;-71.2048
