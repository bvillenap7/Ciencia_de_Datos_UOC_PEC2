4 whitish objects in formation in night sky.;2015-03-17 21:30:00;~1 minute;4 whitish objects in formation in night sky. I was outside looking at the night sky when I noticed 4 round objects slowly moving southward in the sky.  They were lined up equidistant from each other and initially I thought it was one larger object.  They appeared to be illuminated from the bottom in a whitish light. There were no blinking lights to indicate an airplane or helicopter which I observe frequently.  I did not hear any noise or sound but they may have been too far away. As they passed thru the sky the furthest light from me moved slightly away and behind the other 3 lights.  At this point all four lights disappeared at the same time and did not reappear while I was watching. I frequently watch the night sky and observe the stars. I have witnessed meteors, comets, “shooting stars” , the International Space Station as while as search lights and aircraft. Whatever I witnessed was not something I could identify. I am a female my early 50s and have been in healthcare and healthcare management for nearly 25 years. I have a B.S. in Business/Healthcare Management as well as two Associate’s of Science degrees. I own my home in a suburb about 13 miles south of Boston. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));42.1897;-71.2048
