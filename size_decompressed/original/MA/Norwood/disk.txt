We drove up and parked our car on a hill and watched it for a good five minutes and it started drifting away. Our car was turned off completely and we were just watching it. When it drifts away we moved our car to see it and within less than a minute it moved again.  When it started moving more we went down route one and we saw it further in the distance. It seems to be headed toasted Boston.  Now when we had a clear view of it, it seemed to have a green glow and one large red light that kept flashing in the center.  There was air displacement that didn't seem to come from a gas engine.  Now I'm not sure if this is man made or not or where it is now but this is what we saw.;42.1897;-71.2048
