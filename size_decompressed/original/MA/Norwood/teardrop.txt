Never before have i witnessed something like this. Wow!!;2016-10-10 21:30:00;90 seconds;Never before have i witnessed something like this. Wow!! While smoking outside with my mother and stepfather on the front patio.  It was raining and the moon was cresect and waxing.  There appeared two brilliant tear shaped crafts right along side the moon but seemed much closer to the ground.  Almost like in front of the moon but at a lower altitude.  Maybe about 20 000 feet.  I've been a private pilot for 14 years so I have a good sense for AGL.  The two craft were bright pink in color.  They hovered for about 45 seconds and then simultaneously took a sharp left at 90 degrees and shot straight up out of view.  Traveling at several thousands of miles per hour.  They left no streak of light.  They just took off. The strangest thing is, it left a smell.  The whole neighborhood smelled like a sweet fruity smell for about 12 hours???  Really strange and crazy.  I thought i should report.  My first report ever.;42.1897;-71.2048
