I walked into my yard at about 11 o'clock when all of a sudden everything became extreamly bright. I looked up and witnessed a round,silent,brillantly lit silver object.It looked like as if it was the color of murcury.It was only about 50 feet max up in the air. The object had colored lights along the leading edge. The lights were not like regular fixxed lights but more like a molten color to color ring. The craft was directly above me so I had an extreamly perfect view of it.It's not something I imagined, I accually got my mother out to see it also ,but by the time I got her out to see it,it was moving off to our west.This is not something I talk about often,but it is something I remember as if it was yesterday.I don't know if anything happened that night to me but it is not my only experience.The craft was,I would have to say about at least 75 feet in diameter.I don't care who believes me but I would really like to go under hypnotism to find out happened on that occationandothers.My other experiences are much more graffic.I know that there is much more to my story do to physical evidence that was left on my body.There was someone else there to prove my story on another occation also when I was accually left bleading.I sometimes feel a fobia when I am alone at night,and wonder if it is a sign of something happening,has happened,or will be happening?;42.477;-73.1565
