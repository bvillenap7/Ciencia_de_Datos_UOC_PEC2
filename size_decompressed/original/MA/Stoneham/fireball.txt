I came out with my wife and other son (31 YOA), at which time we all observed this orange or fireball coming from the Boston area, northerly towards Stoneham.  It did not seem to be traveling fast, there was no engine sound as a place or helicopter would make.  It turned Easterly and slowed down almost to a standstill, then another one caught up to it about 30 seconds later and it continued traveling east and the 2nd one followed it.  Within a minute a 3rd one showed up from the same flight path and followed #2.  Then less than a minute the 4th one got in line and they all headed east.  My son thought that there may have been one more at the beginning one more in front of the first one that I observed . I posted on FB but no responses yet.;42.4843;-71.0952
