The light dissapeared suddenly and there was no visibility of the object. There was ample space in the sky to see as the object continued in the direction of my perspective. This thing just dissapeared. The event was approximately 15 seconds. No sound could be heard eminating from the object before it's aproach or after it vanished.;42.4509000000006;-73.2494999999999
Orange glowing line in sky.;2013-11-28 19:00:00;~3 minutes;Orange glowing line in sky. I was outside letting my dogs out.  My boyfriend came outside a few minutes later to go to the store.  As he drove away I happen to notice something in the sky. I happen to be facing North west. I saw what seem to be an orange string like object floating across the sky. It was lightly illuminated.  As it floated across the sky it would change form. I closed my eyes a few times to see if what I was seeing was true.  It was night and dark and clear as day I could see this object. I watched this object continue across the sky in the south east direction.  I could not take my eyes off of this now.  I watched it take several different forms.  It wasn't a straight line. It was more like a ribbon floating across the sky, only this was lit up and was large in the sky.   I don't know what I just saw but I do know it wasn't a plane or clouds.  Clouds are not orange and do not move across the sky in that manner.;42.4509000000006;-73.2494999999999
