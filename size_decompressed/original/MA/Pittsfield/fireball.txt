Initially, I had assumed it was Mars - until I realized it was moving slowly in an easterly direction and changing to a fiery orange color.  It was larger initially of course, then became smaller as it appeared to be flying away from me and upward. I had pulled out my camera to take a video successfully until an oncoming vehicle shown it's brights on me.  I was able to capture a shakey 30 seconds or so of it as it slowly changed it's course to a more northerly direction and faded into the sky. The entire experience lasted roughly 10 minutes maximum.  This is the second time either myself or members of my immediate family have seen something of this nature.   This is my second sighting in this city but the first of an orange fiery looking object.  I did not report the first sighting except on social media the following day to ask locals some questions related to what we saw that morning.  The answers only further varified that the object we saw was unidentified and flying.;42.4509000000006;-73.2494999999999
