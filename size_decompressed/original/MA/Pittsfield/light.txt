This incident occurred years ago, but it's fresh in my mind. I saw the following from the front of my tent while on a Boy Scout camp out at October Mountain in Western Massachusetts. The date and time information is only approximate since I didn't record that information at the time. However, the weather was calm and the night sky was clear. A white light came in from the horizon rather rapidly, however, no quicker than a jet. The light wasn't spectacular or anything something you'd expect from an aircraft. It then slowed down once above the camp area and continued along until it went out of site. There were no sounds heard from the object. A few minutes later, another light came in rapidly from the horizon just as the first. My first thought was that it was an Air Force interceptor investigating the original object. However, it gradually stopped and hovered above the camp area. It was fairly high up, perhaps 500 feet (it was difficult to know exactly). There were no sounds from this object as well. It hovered for a short while until the next event occurred. The original object came back from where it went out of site. It stopped and hovered fairly close to the most recent object perhaps within 50-100 feet. This went on for about 20 seconds or so. The 2 objects then went off together and went out of site to where the first object did. About 5 minutes later, the two objects came back and hovered above the camp ground again. Suddenly, one object moved out of the way a bit and carefully adjusted it's position. It then accelerated vertically. I could follow it for about a second. Then it suddenly picked up tremendous speed and literally bolted into the heavens. At that moment, I knew I witnessed a very special technology in action. I didn't know what it was, but I knew it was very special. The other object went to the same takeoff position about 5 seconds later. It then took off in an identical fashion. I don't know what these objects were. However, I'm glad I saw them and will never forget them. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));42.4509000000006;-73.2494999999999
Two fast-moving, silent, amber lights subdued with haze moving southeast over Pittsfield, MA at 19:15.;2007-01-04 19:15:00;15 seconds;Two fast-moving, silent, amber lights subdued with haze moving southeast over Pittsfield, MA at 19:15. At 19:15 I was walking my dog and looked up into the sky.  I saw two lights that appeared to be a kind of amber color.  I thought it was odd because the sky was totally clear but the lights looked like they were subdued by some sort of fog or haze.   From my point of view the lights appeared to be either on the same vehicle or in perfect formation.  They looked like they were no more than 200 yards away from me at the most.  But it was moving so fast that it should have been making a whole bunch of noise.  Instead, it was absolutely silent.   As the lights moved off to the southeast they seemed to rapidly dim until they were no longer visible.   I remember that there was no street noise at all.  I should've been able to hear something. There were no clouds or fog or wind.  The night was absolutely clear and still.     I am a retired Air Force Loadmaster and flew for about 11 years on the C-5 Galaxy out of Westover AFB, MA.  I've seen a lot of strange stuff in those years, but nothing like this.  I'm a combat Veteran from the Gulf War and know what should and shouldn't be in the air.  This is like nothing I've ever seen and it made me shake and perspire once I had seen it.;42.4509000000006;-73.2494999999999
I saw a light in the sky that I could not identify.;2010-06-18 21:00:00;3 min;I saw a light in the sky that I could not identify. My father and I were having a conversation on his back porch on acorn st. He said  hey look at that I saw a simple red light ascending from the tree line that was 100 yards in front of us. the object looked like it was approx. 2-3 miles away and over the city.  As I observed further and the light moved upward from right to left, I noticed that there was a rainbow aura around the steadily shining light.  This object moved without any sound, then it went behind the clouds and was gone. I have been a helicopter pilot for over ten years, and I can say with confidence, it was not anything I can identify.
