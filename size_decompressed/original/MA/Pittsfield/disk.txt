It was when I was very young(5 or 6),before I even started school I remember it very well. Me and my sister went a PTO meeting w/my mom. Me and my sister were outside waiting, I turned around and saw a saucer in the sky. It was probably 100-200 yards away above some houses, it had blue lights circling around it. The saucer looked like it was made from a strange metal, the lights circling the middle of the disk looked like rectangles. It seemed like the whole ship was spinning.I starred at it until it disapeared eastward behind some houses, when I looked at my sister she was facing in the other direction.To this day no one believes me, but that night is one of the clearest memories I have of my childhood.
