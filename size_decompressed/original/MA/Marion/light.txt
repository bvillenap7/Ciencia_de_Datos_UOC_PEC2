Bright bluish-white light visible for 30 seconds to 1 minute and then gone in less than second;2013-12-12 16:20:00;1 minute;Bright bluish-white light visible for 30 seconds to 1 minute and then gone in less than second Somewhere between 4:15 and 4:20 I was traveling NE on 195 and noticed a large bright bluish-white light straight ahead in the cloudless sky and high above the tree line.  I was on a straight stretch of highway.   My first thought was that it was a planet.  The sun was just setting and the sky was still bright and a little early for a planet to be out.  Venus is usually visible first, but it is yellowish, and seen to the west.   As I watched it, it did not move, but it slightly twinkled (another indication that it was not a planet or plane).  Then I reached down to grab a water (in less than a second), and when I looked back up the light was completely gone.  No other lights or clouds were visible at the time.
