Last year on 8/6/04 around 8pm  I was on my way picking up a couple of friends to go see a movie. I was traveling East on Interstate 195 from New Bedford,Ma to Marion,Ma,wich is about 10-15 minutes away.  When I was about 2 1/2 miles from the exit #20 that I would be taking, all of a sudden in the corner of my eye I notice a bright ball shaped light in the sky & immediately got a stange feeling about it!(Looked like it had to be around 400-500 feet up).  It was moving Eastward parallel with the highway,but Inland above the trees, & then in a split second it changes from Ball shaped to Oval shape! Back & forth!! Now I'm getting really nervous because I dont know what I'm looking at! I know for a fact this was not a blimp or anything like that! This Thing wasn't covered w/ lights, It was a Solid (Yellowish) Glowing Object!(With sharp edges...Not fuzzy!) that was (Literally)changing size at will every few seconds! (Very Strange!)  It must of been atleast 100 feet long when Oval! (We don't have any aircraft like this!)A Definate UFO Sighting that, I thought would have been seen by many!,  Since there were several cars on the highway at the same time traveling just ahead & behind me!  There was no reports about it on local tv news, newspapers etc. Never heard anyone mention anything about it...Strange! I sometimes wonder if (They) can choose who sees them & who does not!  Totally freaked me out & Now i wish I hadn't taken that exit off the higway & continued following It instead...Who knows what could of happened?;41.7114;-70.758
