As I proceeded along the road I noticed the light all of a sudden coming towards me off to my left about 300 yards and about 300 yards high and zoomed past very fast.  There were no flashing wing or tail lights or the normal search lights on an air craft.  It passed and disappeared very fast.  It had a small possible stream of light behind it, but it was not a helicopter or air craft as it was silent.;42.4288;-73.0719
