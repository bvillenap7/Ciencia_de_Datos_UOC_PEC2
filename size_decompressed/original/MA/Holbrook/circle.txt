Looming cirle of four large very bright lights (white, tinged with blue and red) Driving down dark roadway and noticed in the sky what I thought was two planes passing very close, almost on top of each other.  Plane pass just below a cirle of four very bright lights.  Cirle of lights did not move as plane passed and in comparasion, cirle of lights was extremely large.  This cirle of lights moved off to the left and stayed in same spot.  Could not see actual outline of craft as lights were big and bright and what stays with me is how large it was and that it was just sitting there.  Saw other planes in the sky and could easily make out their shape.  Did anyone else see this?;42.1473;-71.0068
