Orange lights all moving in the same direction. Scattered ( not in any kind of formation)  No sound. Unable to ascertain height.  Moving at a leisurely pace from my perspective.   One stayed longer and seemed to tarry but eventually moved away in the same general direction as the others.  My wife saw the one that stayed a little longer. I took a couple of pictures with my cell phone.  I posted them on Facebook.;42.1473;-71.0068
