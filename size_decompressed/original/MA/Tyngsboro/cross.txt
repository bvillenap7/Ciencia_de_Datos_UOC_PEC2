Originally thought it was a star through some trees over a lake in tyngsboro MA.  As I turned the corner and cleared the few trees I saw it had moved, at that time I proceeded to following, to make sure it wasn't an airplane.  While following it down a long straight connecting road to the next town now in Dracut MA, I noticed my radio went to static as I got close to it.  At this point I was close enough to see it looked like a very thin cross shape with an orange/amber colored light in the middle.  Once I got that close it would speed up andove to the other side of the street.  Always stayed at the tree line. The closest I got to it looked like the curved disk shape became more prominent and thought I could make out two faint smaller green lights on either side of the middle orange one.  It got faster and finally sped up so much I had to let it go, didn't want to speed.  Seems like it was heading back toward the direction of the next closes river.  It made no soun! d that I could hear, but many birds were chirping and flying about.  Quite more and louder than usual.  It's smooth movements from one area to the sky to another was nothing like I've seen any aircraft do before and would slow down, speed up, and hover, from one second to the next.  Exciting stuff!;42.6707;-71.4164
