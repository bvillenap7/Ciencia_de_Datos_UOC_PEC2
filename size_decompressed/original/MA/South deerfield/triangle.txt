On 1/13/2019 at approximately 11:05 PM, I saw a very bright light north west of my house in South Deerfield.  I watched it for quite some time, and realized there were multiple lights on the underside of what looked like a triangular shaped craft.  The craft made absolutely no noise and hovered about 500 feet to 600 feet above the ground. The craft was very large in size. I observed this craft for about 15 minutes.  It was still hovering in the sky when I went into the house. I was able to capture it on cell phone video, but itâ€™s a bit grainy.;42.473;-72.6189
