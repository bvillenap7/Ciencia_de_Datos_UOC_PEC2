Every night I look up to the Big Dipper, have since childhood.  Tonight I looked up but there were two extra stars to the left of the cup end the two were moving in a northern direction evenly spaced,  1 behind the other the one behind began gaining on the other then they seemed to merge to become one.  At that point within seconds the light broke up into 4 individual lights darting off at high speed each in a direction of their own at a north south east and west.   I have never seen anything like this. I called to my wife to witness it.  she thought I was loosing it!  Found this site while searching if anyone else saw this!;42.5278;-71.1039999999999
