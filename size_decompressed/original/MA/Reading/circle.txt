EXTREMELY SHINY, METALLIC & UNKNOWN IMMOBILE OBJECT.;2014-05-11 06:20:00;Just saw it till i drove ;EXTREMELY SHINY, METALLIC & UNKNOWN IMMOBILE OBJECT On Mother's Day, Sunday, 05/11/2014, at approximately 06:20 hours, I was driving on highway route 128 southbound in the Reading, Massachusetts, area.  The weather conditions was sunny with no overcast in the sky.   At this time I was driving around a bend when I came to a clearing which revealed the sky, an unknown object and the horizon.  The first thing I noticed was this bright, silver and extremely shiny, metallic and circular object located mid-horizon straight ahead of myself.   This object could not have been missed even if you lacked all attention.  This object seemed to have been hovering probably in the vicinity of 15,000 feet from the ground and was the size of roughly 3-4 times the circumference of a mid-sized commercial jet.  I would of liked to observe this object longer than I had but unfortunately had to drive out of the objects view and then I noticed as my attention came to, a Massachusetts State Trooper at my rear bumper.  I did observe this unknown bright object enough to know that it was completely immobile.  I stared at this object waiting for it to turn to see its profile view in search for wings and or exhaust smoke which failed to show.  I was in awe as I viewed this object and I'm sure the other cars on the highway was too as the traffic was low but yet present.  This object cannot be described as anything but unidentified and as it was airborne/flying I have no issue labeling this anomaly as an Unidentified Flying Object.  I am grateful to have viewed this UFO and would like to see if there are others who have shared this same experienced and will report this.  Anyways, keep your heads up and your eyes wide open.
