Stationary Chevron Shaped Object visible above tree top level...;2005-01-07 18:00:00;2 minutes;Stationary Chevron Shaped Object visible above tree top level... At approximately 6:00 pm (EST) on January 7, 2005 I was driving north on route 125 (approx. 1 mile south of the intersection with route 114). When bright lights in the sky caught my eye. At first I thought this might be a plane but, as I drove closer I realized it was stationary. My next thought was could it be a helicopter? No, as there was no sound from blades. As I got closer I could see that the object was Chevron in shape hovering about 150 feet above ground level. It had 2 very bright white lights positioned in it's center front section with no additional red or green lights. As I passed beneath the object I could see an orange/gold glow illuminating it's bottom surface. It appeared to be rather large I would estimate it at some 300 feet wide and 50 to 75 feet from front to back.;42.6511762499999;-71.15834625
