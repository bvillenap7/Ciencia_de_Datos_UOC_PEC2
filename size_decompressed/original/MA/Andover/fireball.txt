Like someone was using a lazer pointer in the sky. I was sitting around a campfire with a couple friends and my girlfriend, and my girlfriend and I looked up at the sky and saw this small red dot zipping around the sky.  It was doing figure eights, and moving pretty eratically at an unthinkable speed.  Like some one was using a lazer pointer but obviously that would be impossible.   We still think about it once and a while today.   I am convinced it was either a meteor that was going out of control haha or it had to be something paranormal.   If anyone has seen anything like this I would love to hear from you. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));42.6511762499999;-71.15834625
