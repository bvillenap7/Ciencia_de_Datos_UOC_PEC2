Random Moving Object;2001-07-23 23:00:00;Three Minutes;Random Moving Object It was about 11 o'clock as my friend and I lay in a field checking out the stars. We were looking for shooting stars when I thought I spotted one. It was the same size as the stars, except it was moving so I thought I had found one. Then I was puzzled to find that it started to change its direction going left to right, then up and down, in a random movement. It would turn right on the button. Eventually we had to leave so we did not get to finish watching it. ((NUFORC Note:  We presume the witness means July 23, not July 24.  We have changed the date here.  PD));42.6511762499999;-71.15834625
