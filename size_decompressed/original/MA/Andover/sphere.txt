Blue ovallish object stationary in the sky and then bolts across the horizon.;1995-02-18 10:00:00;15 seconds;Blue ovallish object stationary in the sky and then bolts across the horizon. It was probably around ten O'clock and my mother and I were driving home on a winding road in a wooded area.   We came around a bend and there was an object in a fixed position in the sky that seemed to simply be hovering there.  It was blue and ovalish and seemed almsot liquid like as the colors seemed to ebb and flow.  As we continued along the road I watched it and as we passed almost directly under it, it zipped across the horizon at an unfathomable speed and was gone.   I looked at my mom and asked her if she had seen if and she said she had.   The article about the Chicago O'hare UFO sighting reminded me of this because the description was almost exact except for the color (though they saw it at dusk which could account for the discrepancy).  Anyway, I have no idea what it was or could be, but do find it interesting each time I recognize descriptions of similar phenomena.
