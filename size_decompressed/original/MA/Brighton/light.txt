It straightend it self out and moved slowly in my direction with the light starting to dim. I listened for a sound like that of a helicopter or plane but their wasn't any noise at all. It moved as if it were an underwater robot probe. Then made a SHARP, perfect right turn, at this point their was another big (round) light on the back side, and you could see that thier was a black silhouett shape to it, and the light seemed to be somewhat white with hues of red flashing like a fireball but again it moved so metodically. I ran from one room th the other to see if I could catch it on the opposit side of the house when I did see it, it was still moving as if probing and I watched it with the lights and no sound move further away but the the light sort of dimmed and went out.;42.3474000000001;-71.1581999999999
Very bright star, no tail, moving at the speed of an airplane, then diming to nothing within seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  Satellite??  PD));2004-09-01 20:45:00;3 minutes;Very bright star, no tail, moving at the speed of an airplane, then diming to nothing within seconds. From the Boston area, I saw what looked like a bright star (maybe a little brighter than the brightest star in the sky).  It was moving south at the pace of a low flying airplane (reasonably quick), but it had no flashing lights and made no sound.  Because of this, I assumed it was VERY high up.  But I wouldn't think a plane that high would move quite that fast.  After watching it for a couple of minutes, it began to dim.  I watched closely as it faded to complete invisibility within about 20 to 30 seconds.  At this point it was still near the highest point in the nights sky, according to my vision.  In other words, it was nowhere near the horizon.  I thought it may be a satellite, but if it was in orbit, why would it vanish so quickly as if it were moving away from earth? ((NUFORC Note:  The description is not inconsistent with a satellite, we believe.  PD));42.3474000000001;-71.1581999999999
