It gave 2 quick bright flashes and then It was a very clear night and I happen to a solid white light moving towards my direction through my back door. I did not see any flashing lights at that time. I lost it behind the trees for a few seconds but then recorded as it came back into view. It then did two quick bright flashes, took a couple dips unlike an airplane would be capable of. Honestly after that I was too afraid to keep watching!;42.3389;-73.3826
