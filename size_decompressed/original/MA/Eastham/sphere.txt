We saw three orbs not quite as bright in the sky as the stars, traveling from northwest to southeast.  Two of the orbs were traveling side by side with the third orb zig zaging between them. The third orb then did a corkscrew maneuver around the left orb and they all cruised off into the distance.  My yard is wide open and we watched it go an impressive distance silently for a few seconds before they vanished into the horizon.;41.8417;-69.9798
