Light over eastern MA moves NW to SE;2010-07-06 22:15:00;2 min;Light over eastern MA moves NW to SE Noticed light moving NW to SE in clear sky.  Constant velocity, very high altitude, and faded after about 2 minutes.  I concluded something entered the atmosphere.  Not a satellite or airplane, certainly not a meteor.  Much brighter than satellites, comparable to other major night sky stars. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.  PD));41.8417;-69.9798
Bright Lights Over beach, with big red light over ocean;2020-08-09 20:50:00;20 minutes;Bright Lights Over beach, with big red light over ocean After we saw weird bright lights over the ocean we saw a light ovalish duck behind a the dunes and then light up the dunes with very bright lights.  We then saw 3-4 white light objects I do have a picture.  A hour later we drove by that same beach and saw a HUGE red light that got smaller and started as a oval, then a half upside down oval, then a rectangle, then just vanished.;41.8417;-69.9798
