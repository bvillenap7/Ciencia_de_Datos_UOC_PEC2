Red light making unusual moves.;2014-11-08 20:20:00;5 minutes;Red light making unusual moves. My girl friend and I had just arrived home at 8:20 p.m and noticed to the northwest a hovering red  light.  The red light was solid, unblinking and 40 deg. above the horizon.  There where other strobe lights that were in the same vicinity that could be identified as conventional aircraft.   The light then made an abrupt movement  to the south west, hovered for a bit, then quickly moved back to its original spot.   At this point it quickly dropped to a slightly lower altitude, stood still for several minutes and then shot off toward the northwest disappearing behind the tree line. No sound was detected.;41.7456105263158;-71.1561894736842
