Flying craft cloaking ind uncloaking.;2018-09-01 17:10:00;2 minutes;Flying craft cloaking ind uncloaking While driving east on route 6 just near the Swansea/Somerset line, I looked to the south side of the roadway and up in the sky probably less than 3/4 mile there was a craft that was as long as a Huey Helicopter, if not larger, flying about 2000 ft, it was gun metal in color with a cylindrical shape.  It looked like it had four large wings that bent.  It appeared to be cloaking and uncloaking then completely disappeared.  There was no sound to the aircraft, which tells me it wasnâ€™t a helicopter. Not sure if anyone else saw it, since I was driving in traffic it was difficult to pull over on this roadway. Because my of my experience in personal drones and my husband being a drone pilot,  I am absolutely sure this was not a drone.  It was too large and it the disappearing/reappearing also negates this fact as well.;41.7456105263158;-71.1561894736842
