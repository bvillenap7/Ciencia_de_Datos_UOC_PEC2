75+ lights swarmed the sky in Massachusetts.;2012-12-19 04:00:00;3 minutes;75+ lights swarmed the sky in Massachusetts. 75+ circular lights all moving around one area in the sky.  Faded in and out of the clouds, quickly started to vanish until only a few were left, all moving in a manor of nothing I could explain.  Sighting lasted about 3-5 mins.  I took pictures but was unable to see anything, they were to far away. Waited for about 15 mins but they never returned.;41.7456105263158;-71.1561894736842
