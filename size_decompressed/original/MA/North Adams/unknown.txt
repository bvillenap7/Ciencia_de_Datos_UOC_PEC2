Star like object flashing colors and hovering for over an hour in one stop.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible star??  PD));2008-10-19 21:00:00;1 hour;Star like object flashing colors and hovering for over an hour in one stop My husband & I were on our deck and noticed what we first thought was an ambulance on the top of the mountain behind our house because of the flashing lights. We soon realized though that IT was above the mountains. It was like a star, but it was flashing colors of green, red, white and blue, so we knew it had to be something more. It just hovered in that one area for over an hour. It made NO sound either. If it was a helicopter, which is the only thing that could have stayed that still for that long, we would have heard something. It also looked to be surrounded by 2 or 3 other star like things that were also blinking, but only white. We went in side for a while and when we came back out they were all gone.
