I was looking at the spot, I thought thats a brite light the brite light was stationary west south west of my home, North Adams, Massachusetts. Okay i am looking at the brite object in one moment the light ball as it looked to me. At in about 1/4 of a second seemed to move vertical just a hair I saw the light move it seemed to me to move a bit then it was gone strait up gone upward at flash speed off the map away toward space. What could it be led light, maybe the International space station, maybe extraterestial spacecraft. Your Truly;42.6954999999998;-73.0800000000005
