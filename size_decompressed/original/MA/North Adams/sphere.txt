She was in her car traveling home on Protection Ave, towards home. When suddenly in the distance she could see a craft(UFO) was approaching her car, It did not turn towards the small local airpot but instead came  right at her car. it did have very bright light and was sphere shapped. She stopped her car the next instant the UFO was on her left side hovering over a very large elm tree it made no noise. She was so frightened she slammed on the gas and drove home (2miles) and almost hit our house with her car, she came screeming saying she just seen a UFO and go get the bonoculers and look out back she was shaking she was so scarred, but we did not see a thing. she called the local airport and police to report the sighting and the next day there was an artical in the local papaer about the sighting and it reported 8 other people seeing the object that day, also the large elm tree did die after the sighting;42.6954999999998;-73.0800000000005
Tell me someone else saw the same thing I saw last night!  Red flickering lights that appeared to be in a group or a circle.;2014-07-21 23:00:00;5 minutes;Tell me someone else saw the same thing I saw last night!  Red flickering lights that appeared to be in a group or a circle. It was right before we went to bed.  My girlfriend called me outside with a panic in her voice.  I said, Oh, no, not again.   It was true!   There were 5 flying objects in the open sky that were very bright red/yellow flickkering lights.  Each one hoovered over each other in a circled pattern.   As we watched in shock we watch one by one craft disappear instantly.  There was NO trail of lights like you see as if it were an airplane or helicopter.   After they floated in the sky the crafts disappear one by one.  Leaving NO trace.   I am convinced these were UFO's.  We are not alone.............that i know after last night.  I was amazed and called to tell my mother who has always believed.  It was the most exciting thing I have ever witnessed.;42.6954999999998;-73.0800000000005
