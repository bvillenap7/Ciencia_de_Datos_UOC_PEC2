Blinking light zig-zagging across the sky.;2010-01-16 20:40:00;2 min;Blinking light zig-zagging across the sky. I observed a light in the Southern sky.  Crystal clear night, no moonlight.  Naturally thought it was a plane because it was blinking, but i observed no other lights, so i thought it may be a satellite.  The light began to zig-zag numerous times, then would continue on a straight line but at a different angle from it's original path.  No sound accompanied the object.  I could see it for at least two full minutes, before it flashed away.;42.0713;-71.478

Many yellow-orange objects crossing sky all in one direction.;2014-11-14 18:45:00;15 minutes;Many yellow-orange objects crossing sky all in one direction Approx 6:30 pm, got out of car after arriving home from work, noticed unusual yellow-orange objects passing across the sky.   I stood and watched for 10 minutes or so, a fairly steady stream of these objects which was probably 30 or more during the time I was watching.  Some appeared to be grouped, they were not in a straight line but all traveling in the same direction.   They appeared from one direction and passed across the sky above my neighborhood.  There was no sound.  It was nothing I had ever seen before.  It was a clear, starlit evening. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

3 orbs moving about the sky above my home;2018-08-22 23:00:00;3+ hours;3 orbs moving about the sky above my home I have seen these lights several nights this summer and the pics that I am sending were  taken on 7/29/18 8/5/18 and 8/9/18.  On the night of 8/22/18 I was sitting on my back porch and witnessed 2 orbs in the sky, an orange one in the south and  a white one to the  South West.  They looked very similar to stars but after watching closely for about 15 minutes I saw that they were making movements up, down, left and right.  I watched them for more than 3 hours.  They were still there when I went in for the night.   Also, while observing these lights I saw another orange orb move quickly across the sky from North to South.  I am a 40 yr old single mother of 1 boy.  I waitress for a living in a fine dining restaurant and I have had an interest in ufology for a long time now.;42.0713;-71.478
On the night of 9/7/18 my mother (58 yrs old retired postal worker), step father (66 yrs old naval architect), and myself (40 yr old st;2018-09-07 20:15:00;5+ hours;On the night of 9/7/18 my mother (58 yrs old retired postal worker), step father (66 yrs old naval architect), and myself (40 yr old student/waitress) stepped out onto the back porch after dinner and noticed an orange ball of light just above the tree line to the south.  It was slowly moving towards us.  As it got closer it also went higher.  After about an hour it seemed to have stopped practically right on the edge of the back yard to the southwest.  It still made movements up, down, left and right but in one small area. We then noticed another ball of light to the west but this one was white.  It made the same type of movements in one small area and eventually after about an hour of gradually moving higher and higher kept getting smaller until it disappeared. In the meantime the orange one was still in the same spot to the southwest making the same small movements but, after about 2 hours began moving slowly to the west at the same altitude.  It eventually came to a stop and began moving further away and becoming smaller until it disappeared behind the tree line.;42.0713;-71.478
