At 6:17 PM on November 10 2013, I was outside looking up at the stars and thought I saw a satellite flying overhead.  Then suddenly it changed directions.  It continued to change directions for about 5 minutes, and then it more or less settled in to drifting between 2 stars.  If you were to draw a line between the 2 stars, it would continuously drift across this centerline but also, it would move closer to one star then the other.  This was all in the eastern sky.  A second object appeared and flew by the first in a southerly direction till it disappeared.  A third object appeared, randomly changing directions.  It also flew south till it disappeared.  The 4th object flew by the drifting one in a southerly direction but didn’t disappear exactly. It was in plain sight.  Suddenly there was a bright flash of light and it was gone.  The 5th object flew off in a southerly direction as well, but faded till it was out of sight.  The 1st object is still there at 7:35 PM.  I haven’t seen any more yet.
