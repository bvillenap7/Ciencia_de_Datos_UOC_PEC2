The trees and brush below it were pushed down and away , like a force was  holding them there, they did not move or sway at all. I was standing on a small storage building in our back yard situated on a small hill. The craft was about  100 yards away west of where I was , I was facing north. It was slightly below horizontal line of view. I could see its right side, some of its top , and some of its rear. It looked like the space shuttle, but much sleeker, no markings, no sign of seams or windows, or propulsion units from the rear. I was outside that dayand noticed a silence, unnatural, thats when I got on the building. I got down to get someone else, changed my mind and got back up on the building, about a minite, it was gone. I noticed a dot in the sky to the northeast that got smaller and disapeared, fast. (NUFORC Note:  Date in June 1974 is approximate.  PD));42.0713;-71.478
