Strange light progressivly brighter, cone of light from below in Massachusetts, ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));2009-09-19 19:50:00;1 minute;Strange light progressivly brighter, cone of light from below in Massachusetts, ~addendum~ I was outside on my driveway, talking to my friend on my cell phone.  I was looking into the night sky since it was unusually clear and starry.  I was facing south-west when suddenly, what I thought was a star, looking like all other stars, started to get progressively brighter.  From below a light started to emit down like a skirt, or a cone, very slowly.  It almost seemed like a comet coming from the earth, except that it wasnâ€™t moving, it was sitting perfectly still. I ran in to get my girlfriend to see what was happening.  Just as she was coming out, the object that was emitting this light seemed to have shot straight up, and the cone of light started to disperse.  My girl friend got to see the curtain of light disappearing.  I stayed outside looking for anything else strange I did notice that there was increased air traffic after the event.  Strange fast flying air craft lights flying around the area. it was at about a 30 degrees elevation in the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));42.0713;-71.478
