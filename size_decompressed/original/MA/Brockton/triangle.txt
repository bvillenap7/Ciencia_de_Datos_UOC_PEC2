An object stops dead in it's track!;1990-02-15 20:17:00;4 min;An object stops dead in it's track! I was at my back porch/driveway going to my car to get my laundry when three lights caught my eye.The wind was blowing at about 20-30 mph to the north east,The craft or crafts where traveling from north east to southwest at a speed of maybe 120-130 mph. and at about 1000-1500 feet altitude,and at an elevation of 70 degrees to my north east.The objects made no sound even at closest approach.My back porch light was on so I was in its light,while I was watching the three lights move towards me the one light closest to my viewpoint stopped dead in it's track for about 3-5 seconds while the other two kept moving.So it had lost ground to the others,then moved very quickly to catch up with the other two,were as it regained it's original position and continued with the other two off to the south west were as I lost visual contact behind some brownstone homes down my field of view.;42.0795805084746;-71.0326203389831
came out of nowhere, disappeared into the sky;1995-05-01 21:30:00;2 minutes;came out of nowhere, disappeared into the sky I was siting on front porch with 4 other people, the sky was dark, all of a sudden there was this humming sound. Then out of no-where this triangular shaped craft appeared, it blended with the nite sky the only way we saw it was that it had big round light on the underneath of each corner. Then it made like a jerking motion , lowered a little bit right over the tree tops and the humming became almost silent.It actualy hovered there for about 6-10 seconds, then it lifted up made that jerking sound again and mad a fast sharp turn and disappeared as quickly as it had appeared, almost silent.

Suspected UFO, hovering in an unpopulated area over the tree line.;2008-11-16 23:00:00;2 minutes;Suspected UFO, hovering in an unpopulated area over the tree line. I was driving my wife to work, when suddenly a formation of white lights appeared in the sky, they were moving very slowly as if it were a slug.  It seemed to switch formations from a single light, to three white lights.  They continued to climb through the sky, changing formation from time to time.  Even though the craft was going very slow, at time to time it would burst into enormous speed so if you blinked you would've missed it.  I pointed to the object shouting What is that!.  She looked up and was astounded by the sight.  As soon as they appeared, they burst into enormous speed heading west, into the horizon.

Fiery orange triangle with blinking lights on rear, moved from east to west and pitched from side to side.;2012-10-18 19:50:00;3-5 minutes;Fiery orange triangle with blinking lights on rear, moved from east to west and pitched from side to side. I am located in Brockton, Massachusetts, near the border with Holbrook and Abington. I was outdoors facing the northeast, watching the sky for meteors. First saw a normal airplane come over the horizon and travel across the sky. Next, I noticed an iridescent orange glow that I could not initially resolve.  Went to get my prescription glasses out of my car and it had moved further along. It was triangle shaped, and the color and light it seemed to be emitting was like fire.  As it passed directly overhead and moved off toward the western sky,  I noticed blinking lights on the rear of the object. Starting in the east, it did not move in a fixed path like an airplane would, but instead was moving off side to side slightly irregularly while heading east/west.  It then banked northwest slightly after passing overhead and appeared to be pitching side to side, making the triangle shape more obvious against the dark sky.  It was still fiery orange but almost appeared to ! be reflecting light while pitching rather than emitting.  The whole sighting lasted approximately five minutes total.  The object did not emit any sound, and was moving at approximately the same speed as an aircraft in the distance that had been spotted a moment earlier.  Horizon to horizon over a few minutes.  It did not appear to be a meteor or bolide, and did not break up or leave a trail behind.;42.0795805084746;-71.0326203389831
