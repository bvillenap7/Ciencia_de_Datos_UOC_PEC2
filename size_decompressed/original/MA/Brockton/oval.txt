Orange oval craft with no sound.;2016-08-20 22:57:00;45 seconds;Orange oval craft with no sound On the night of Aug 20th approx. 11pm, I was on my back porch with a friend hanging out observing the sky, when my friend said hey what is that.  We both observed what looked like an orange light traveling from SE to NW.  The sky was clear of clouds and there was a bright moon. As the craft approached us, I grabbed my Iphone to record video and my friend grabbed my binoculars.  He couldn't zero in on the object fast enough to get a good look but I got it on video for the duration of the event. Right away, we both thought it was a drone, but when it traversed such a great distance at a relatively fast speed we were convinced it was not a drone.  There were no aviation lights on the craft, and it was a dark orange in color it almost had a pearl type glow to it. Meaning the color kind of had a swirl to it.  It was shaped sort of like an egg on it's side.  There was no noise and it appeared to be pretty close and low in the sky although it was difficult to tell with no clouds to judge altitude. My friend who is also an avid sky watcher said it resembled a rocket launch, so we right away started researching any launches for that night and there was none. It wasn't a star, meteor, plane, drone or helicopter.  We were both amazed at what we were seeing and could not believe our eyes.  Thank goodness I was with a witness and got video of the event.;42.0795805084746;-71.0326203389831
