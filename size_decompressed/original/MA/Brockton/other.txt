Large Craft Hovers Over Highway in Mass;1990-02-15 20:15:00;10 Minutes;Large Craft Hovers Over Highway in Mass I was traveling North on Rte. 3 between Brockton and Plymouth about 8:15 PM February 15 1990 when a very large craft passed over going from south east to north west about 200 Mph. followed shortly by another and then a third which stopped directly overhead. We pulled off the highway along with about 40 other vehicles and we got out to have a better look.  The craft was like any other I had ever seen and I have seen plenty. I have worked in aviation for about 15 years including a tour in the U. S. Airforce. This massive craft just stopped and hovered over us for about 6 minutes. It was black or dark grey and had very few lights but there was enough residual light from the highway streeet lights to allow us to see the size and shape of the craft and some of its massive demensions. I would have some difficulty giving an exact lateral measurement except to say that it could have easily have contained a nuclear aircraft carrier. It was nearly as tall as it was long if you were to include the vertical projections. It was hexagonal in shape and had 3 vertical projections above the upper surface ending in a t tail formation located equidistant at the 120 240 and 360 degree locations if you were to look at the craft as a disk. there was one white light in the center of the bottom surface of the craft and a red and blue light on each side of the horizontal element of the vertical projections. The craft was completely silent. After about 8 minutes the craft moved suddenly and rapidly twards the northwest in the same direction that the other 2 craft had gone and was shortly followed by 5 F-16 fighters from I believe Otis ANG Base which is in close proximity to the south west near the towns of Sandwich and Falmouth. That base is no longer active. When I arived home I was shocked to find that the television news had reported that there had been sightings reported to be UFOs all up and down the east coast from Virginia to Newfoundland in Canada. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We observe that it would be the rare exception that the news would report UFO sightings, particularly so soon after the alleged sighting.  It usually takes days for the news media to awaken to a suspected UFO-related incident, and they usually ascribe the event to meteors, swamp gas, crash dummies, aurora displays, etc..

Firey shooting star..?;2002-06-02 22:42:00;1-3 sec.;Firey shooting star..? This was What I thought to be a typical shooting star. Although the tail behind this one was red and firey. I just looked up a site for info on sitings to see if this had any signifigance? It was almost commet looking in shape and velocity . I only caught what was the last second or two before it either went out or faded into the clear star lit horizon.;42.0795805084746;-71.0326203389831
Bright, white, pulsating light seen in sky above Brockton, Massachusetts;2017-11-23 02:00:00;2-4 minutes;Bright, white, pulsating light seen in sky above Brockton, Massachusetts Woke up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom, noticed a bright light coming through the window of the bathroom which was located on the second floor.  No light ever shines through that window, there are no street or flood lights in that area.   When I looked out the window, I saw an extremely bright white light in the sky, unmoving, at about roof level, approximately a half mile away from the house.  It seemed to be in the shape of a diamond with rounded edges.  The way the light pulsated reminded me of the way light ripples across water.   I had no idea what I was looking at.  I could clearly see the stars above this object.  It was definitely not a star or planet, it was much closer and larger than the stars appeared.   My phone was charging downstairs, so I went to get it so that I could photograph the object.  When I returned to the bathroom, as I entered, the light quickly went out.  This occurred before I could get back to the window.  When I looked out again, there was nothing.   I have no idea what this was, or if anyone else saw it.;42.0795805084746;-71.0326203389831
