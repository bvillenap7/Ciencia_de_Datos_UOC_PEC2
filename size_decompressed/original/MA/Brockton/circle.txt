Fleets of ufos increasing by the numbers light spheres.;2015-06-12 02:00:00;45 minutes;Fleets of ufos increasing by the numbers light spheres At 2 am from 3am, there was small light spheres heading north by the dozens through a thick cloud cover just heading in the same pattern direction, one after another some lights were brighter then some.  On flew in a triangle pattern.  i cant stress enough of how this was a fleet this wasnt like one or two spheres of light it was 50 to 100 easly flying above a thick cloud cover.but there was holes in the clouds where you could see ufos flying in one pattern form like they had a course set with no stop.  Not only was the fleet a sight to see but the way after this fleet had passed the cloud cover passed after all ufos passed it was instantly a clear night.;42.0795805084746;-71.0326203389831
UFO or Planet?  ((NUFORC Note:  Probably a sighting of Venus, we suspect.  PD));2017-02-24 20:00:00;Not to sure;UFO or Planet? Not sure if it was a planet but definitely not a star.  Saw a half circle light in the sky to the west towards the town of Easton, MA.  It didn't move that I could see.  The night before 2/23/17 was in almost the same place except it looked different.   It seemed to have a small light on top elongated light in the middle and another round light on the bottom.  Again it didn't seem to move.  I'm emailing a picture I took on 2/24/17. On 2/23/17 I didn't get a picture.  I truly believe in UFO's & the possibility that they could be intelligent life observing Earth and humanity but to what extent baffles me and worries me.  If this turns out to be Venus or some other planet, at least I did my part. ((NUFORC Note:  Probably a sighting of Venus, we suspect.  PD));42.0795805084746;-71.0326203389831
