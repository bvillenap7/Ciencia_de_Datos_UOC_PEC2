The Sighting;1971-06-15 11:00:00;one hour;The Sighting   I was sitting in my living room watching television...had a picture window in my condo that looked out onto the back yard behind my condo..... Saw lights flashing wildly....alot of lights...television went out and turned black...no picture no sound....I looked out of window and saw a spaceship land in my yard and upon landing I saw 6 little men jump out of spacecraft and they were working...loading or I think unloading stuff and working frantically fast and very busy but could not figure out what exactly they were unloading...but it was a bit of work....called to my son who was ten years old at the time...and said to him  Curt...quick...you have to see this and he did walk up to the window and he saw the whole scene also...To this day he remembers this as do I..... dont remember anything about the rest of the night. dont even remember if I went to bed or if I might have ventured outside.  Knowing me I probably did venture outside my apartment to see because I have always been interested in this stuff..... wow  my mind has been blown ever since.... all these years...and I still feel like I should be hypnotized to find out more....

bright baloon like ufo with light circulating under it in brockton Mass. in 1989 .;1989-06-15 20:00:00;less than 5 minutes;bright baloon like ufo with light circulating under it in brockton Mass. in 1989 . I was 7 years old at the time. My mom, my step dad, my aunt, my uncle, my two sleeping sisters and I were walking home from my uncle's birthday party. I remember my mom saying ooh look how big the moon is tonight. My uncle said in responce If that's the moon, then what is that? everyone froze and stared at the huge object that seemed to look like a big glowing baloon. It was like a light bulb! and it had colors circling on the bottom. I was so scared that I jumped behind some bushes on the right of the sidewalk. My step dad and my my mom were arguing over what it was. My step dad said it was just a baloon lighted from the inside, while my mom told him it couldn't be because it had no sign or seemed to advertise anything. I am sending you this because around that time there seemed to be other reports. please tell me if there were any. I want to confirm if it was really an unidentified craft or some baloon. At the time of the sighting it was over some houses and disappeared a couple of times behind some trees. please let me know if anything comes up. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
