I looked up in the sky and saw what appeared to be two bright stars.  I stayed out longer than usual and had a second cigarette when I noticed, what I thought to be stars, were now moving slowly in all different directions.  I went back inside studied for another hour and went back out to the balcony to have another cigarette once again I noticed the two bright lights in different locations but still moving slowly in all different directions and at times they would suddenly stop and stay in one position for a few minutes and start moving slowly again.  This continued until 4 AM and then they suddenly disappeared.   This has continued at least 2-3 times a week from February to present day July 31, 2010 around midnight again.  I woke my husband one night at 2 AM on another night I was studying, because he didn't believe me and said that I had gone mad from all the studying and he witnessed one of the starlike objects moving around.  He didn't know what to make of it and then proceeded to tell me not to wake him up again.  I'm very fascinated by this and wondered could they be satellites and went online tonight to do some research after six months of witnessing these things in the sky and found out I'm not the only one seeing these lights.  I can't wait to show my husband! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));42.0795805084746;-71.0326203389831
Three glowing ambers lights flying in a formation over Brockton, MA;2011-02-08 19:15:00;30 secs;Three glowing ambers lights flying in a formation over Brockton, MA At approximately 7:15 on February 8th, I went to take my dogs for a walk and was noticing how clear the sky was and how bright the stars were.  I saw one glowing amber light brighter and bigger than a star but not bright like an airplane light.  Then I noticed two others off to the left in almost a triangular formation at matching speed. There was no sound. In reference there was an airplane that was further that I could hear clearly.  I thought it may have been one craft, an airplane at a weird angle until the rightmost light started moving slowly closer to the other two lights.   The first moving light as it got  closer the other two seemed to start moving in a three way figure eight.  They all stopped dead and reversed course and sped off at an alarming speed.;42.0795805084746;-71.0326203389831
