60-80 ft in diameter, disc shaped, flat on top, red and green lights underneath.;1977-06-15 22:30:00;20 min;60-80 ft in diameter, disc shaped, flat on top, red and green lights underneath. I was 18 at the time of the sighting.  I was staying alone at our summer home on Otis Reservoir.  I was watching TV when the reception was lost and I looked out the picure window and saw it.  The disc was hovering over a small island directly across the cove from our cottage.  It was as big as the island about 60 - 80 ft., it was saucer shaped, flat on top and red and green lights underneath.  I got on the phone to call for help, the call went through but the other party couldn't hear me above the static when I started to explain what I was looking at.  After a few minutes it came directly over the house very slowly, and within a minute or so the TV reception came back.   The following morning I heard on the radio that six were seen that night and it was on the front page of the local Winsted, CT, newspaper. ((NUFORC Note:  Date in 1977 is approximate.
