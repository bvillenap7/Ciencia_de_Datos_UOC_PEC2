Early morning trangle spotted near airport;2006-03-25 04:30:00;1 minute;Early morning trangle spotted near airport Due to the nature of my job,I am required to get dragged out of bed at unusual hours. I am a lineman for one of the local utilities. This particular night I was on a pole hit,which requires us to respond and replace the pole and wires,ect.  While I was waiting to get into the pole to do my work  there is some down time while other utilities get to do their work first), I noticed a triangler shape with 3 lights, 1 on each corner and a red light in the center coast by at a low altitude. No sound at all.   At the time,I paid no real attention to it, being in such close location to Bradley International Airport.  I assumed it was a UPS flight or something.It was not for a day or so later when it occurred to me that that was no UPS flight or anything else I was familiar with.  I grew up around airports,my dad was in the Air National Guard (104th) base at Barnes in Westfield,MA, and we are surrounded by airports, including Westover AFB in Chicopee, MA.  I've seen thousands of take offs and landings, holding patterns, you name it and this was not anything that I've ever seen.   Got me wondering,what it was. Very odd.;42.0511;-72.7706
