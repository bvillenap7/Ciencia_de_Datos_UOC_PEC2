Then I noticed what looked like a star about the same distance in the sky moving at the same speed a plane would across the sky but much too far away.  I continued to watch this object as it made its way toward another star is if the crash into it.  At that point it was still moving in a straight line until it came close to the other star.  I was breathless as it speed up and made a half circle around the star and continued on its path heading due north.  Again, all this happened within 10-15 seconds then puff it was gone.  My friend and I looked at each other in disbelief.  Incredible experience and my first in 36 years....;42.2533981012657;-71.0011645569618
Multiple pulsating and bizarre formations of reddish-orange orbs maneuvering at various projectories.;2014-04-12 21:10:00;~30 minutes;Multiple pulsating and bizarre formations of reddish-orange orbs maneuvering at various projectories. On April 12th, 2014, in Quincy, MA (near Wollostan Beach), I witnessed a spectacular event, to which I have no explanation. I first witnessed 3 distinct orange orbs in a triangular formation that soon became dispersed in a very subtle, and fading in and out-floating way.  I honestly thought I was just seeing things, but decided to grab my Ipad and record the following event:  Recorded via Ipad(although unfortunately, 10 times illegible versus the naked eye) I was noticing multiple reddish-orange orbs pulsating and maneuvering at odd trajectories.  They were lighting up the sky- many many many of them!  It was as though some of them would hover and some would skip in the sky.  Sometimes leaving visual traces of their flight pathsâ€¦.. Some would hover, some would move in right angles and zip amongst the sky, some were pulsating, some were moving in what appeared to be in formation- sometimes forming distinct geometric patterns, some flashing in and out of focus, some turning slightly different colors- such as green-amber glows, etc. That very night, the moon had a very peculiar glow and a mist or cloud formation that took on the shape of a beautiful circle of clouds or something equivalent. Just so you know, I am an artist and an art professor at a respectable college, and my eyes are very keen to subtlety.  I honestly thought that most of what I was seeing was perhaps due to retinal fatigue, but when I went inside after the orange orbs, I decided to Ipad-video record this event. I do not claim to see little green men.  I do not claim to have seen an ET.  I DO CLAIM THAT I SAW SOMETHING VERY VERY VERY PECULIAR AND VERY VERY ODD, THAT SEEMS TO BE AN INCREDIBLE VISUAL PHENOMANOM- whether it was natural or something else (even UFO like)  I have seen footage of Japanese/chinese lanterns, Aurora Borealis, flares, weather balloons, jets (as my father was in the military- I used to live in Fort Bragg, NC), drones, etc,..     and NONE OF THESE FIT THE BILL!!  I have no clue what I saw but am absolutely confounded and mystified what I had seen!!!!   Anyways, I hope that I am not crazy, or that I will NOT be publicly humiliated by these words, as I was honestly hesitant about sharing my experience.;42.2533981012657;-71.0011645569618
Green oval shape shoot across the sky and then disappeared.;2016-09-21 22:00:00;5 seconds;Green oval shape shoot across the sky and then disappeared. I saw a green oval shape move from quickly through the sky first going right to left, up and down, then is disappeared.   The sky was very cloudy and it was difficult to even see planes however this unidentified flying object was very bright and easily seen.  It was silent.;42.2533981012657;-71.0011645569618
