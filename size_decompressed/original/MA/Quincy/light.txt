At first I thought it may have been a planet as Venus was visible.  The object appeared to be moving.   I stood in front of a tree to block the object from my sight.  The object did come in to my view again so is was indeed moving.  It did appear that some lights were flashing on it (blue/greenish in color).;42.2533981012657;-71.0011645569618
