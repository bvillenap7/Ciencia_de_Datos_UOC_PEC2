I stared at it for a few seconds thinking it was some sort of balloon when I realized metal shining as it spinner. The rotation and direction was consistent.  I then pulled out my phone and recorded 3 seconds of it because the sun was so bright I didn’t realize I didn’t catch much.;42.2533981012657;-71.0011645569618
