Noticed small dark sphere appear from over tree line in back yard traveling  at a fairly slow speed, similar to passing commercial aircraft during approach to Logan airport.  Object was approx. at a 70 degree angle in sky from my position, so it passed not far from directly above me.  Object briefly passed through low cloud cover as it moved over head passing by having consistent speed and trajectory.  Eventually, lost sight  of object in cloud cover in distance.;42.2533981012657;-71.0011645569618
