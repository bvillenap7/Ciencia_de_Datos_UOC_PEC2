A triangle shaped object moved over South Quincy into East Braintree.;2012-09-02 02:25:00;1 minute;A triangle shaped object moved over South Quincy into East Braintree. I was sitting outside facing West when a triangle shaped object about the size of a commercial airliner approached from the North, heading South.  The object was flying at a much lower altitude than any aircraft of that size normally would.  The object was making a sound that sounded like a fan buffeting air.  The noise was loud enough to be clearly heard, and grew louder as the object approached.  The object was shaped like a triangle, with a red light on the front tip and one white light on each back tip. When the object was directly in front of me it turned East, moving straight towards me as it lowered its altitude and its speed.  When it was less than a football field away from me it suddenly turned Southeast, quickly accelerating its speed and moving out of my field of vision.  Several black helicopters were seen in the area for the remainder of the night and the following day.;42.2533981012657;-71.0011645569618
Two unidentified triangular objects circling 02169;2013-04-26 03:30:00;1 hour;Two unidentified triangular objects circling 02169 At approximately 3am a &quotUFO&quot began to circle around our house. We live on the Logan Airport's landing route but have never seen a flying object like this.  White and red lights on this object were flashing sporadically. No sound of engines.  At 4 am a second &quotUFO&quot began to circle.  First object circled about 20 times.  Once the second one appeared, the 2 circled together for about 5 times until the 1st disappeared.  The second UFO had lights much brighter than the first and is moving at a much faster speed. Both objects appeared to be in a triangle shape.;42.2533981012657;-71.0011645569618
As I am waiting outside for my car to come out of the washing bay I look;2016-07-24 11:00:00;5 minutes;Had my car washed at a car wash in West Quincy, Massachusetts.  As I am waiting outside for my car to come out of the washing bay, I looked up at the very clear blue sky. Noticed what appeared to be two seagull type birds at about 100 feet circling each other.  When I looked to the right of the birds I noticed what I thought were two other birds circling each other at a great rate of speed, but I realized that they were much too high in the sky to be birds.  Would say they were well over 50,000 feet directly above me nearly 90 degrees vertical from the horizon straight up.  It looked like the two objects were putting on an air show very high in the atmosphere. Took out my I Phone to take a picture after one of the objects banked and the sun bounced off of the object revealing a narrow triangular shape body with what appeared to be almost corrogated vertical lines on the side of the object. Just before I snapped the picture the object disappeared like the light from a light bulb disappears when you turn it off. The other person waiting for their car said there had been UFO sitings in New Hampshire yesterday. Again, when the object turned it revealed a thin triangular shape with corrogated vertical lines evenly space along the entire side. Attempted to take a picture with my I Phone and both objects vanished seconds before I could snap the picture. Weather conditions. Sunny and clear blye sky.   Time of Day: 11 AM EST.   Date: July 24, 2016.  Location: Centre Street West Quincy, Massachusetts.;42.2533981012657;-71.0011645569618
