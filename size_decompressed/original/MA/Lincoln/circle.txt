I had never seen anything move that fast;2020-01-05 18:30:00;3 seconds;I had never seen anything move that fast I was driving with my daughter on Route 2 going towards Boston around 6:30 PM.  We had just passed Bedford Road traffic light in Lincoln.  Both of us saw a ball of yellow light moving very rapidly from our right to left.  The speed of this object was much faster than a jet plane and slower than meteorite.  The object was not at the usual height where airplane flies but at much lower level.  We saw the object for about 3 seconds and then the light just went off.;42.4206;-71.3141
