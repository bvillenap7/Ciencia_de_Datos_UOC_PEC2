At first, I really didn't think anything of it until my wife and I saw a second orange ball moving in the same direction.  Whatever it was did not make any noise and they were moving at a moderate pace.  The objects did not have any trail and moved at a steady pace across the horizon. My wife and I were on the back deck talking when the soundless fireballs caught our eye. we definitely were not expecting to see such a phenomenon, and were quite dumbfounded when confronted by it.   My wife and I are family oriented, and we own a small business in the local area.  We are not sure what to think about the incident.;42.1153;-71.6644
