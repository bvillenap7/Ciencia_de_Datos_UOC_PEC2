It was moving very slowly, almost hovering.  Spherical, or oval ... couldn't tell.  Silent.  Lights (white, orange, a couple of red ones) flashing rotationally. NOT a star, not an airplane, helicopter or blimp.  This is a very rural small town and we are not under any flight paths except for an occasional fighter plane being moved from one air force base to another.  This was NOT one of those ... they move very fast and this was barely moving at all. I used binoculars to get a better look, but it was dark, so really, I could only guess its shape from the pattern of the lights. I'm 62 and have never seen anything like it.  Altitude approx that of a passenger aircraft, speed more like a blimp.  You don't get blimps in Uxbridge, I assure you. NEVER.  A lot of lights, which is why I noticed it.  No leaves on the trees, or I might not have seen it at all. And silent.  Completely, absolutely silent. I'm hoping someone else happened to see it, but I don't know how many folks in the Valley are up this late and outside in the middle of the night (other smokers??);42.0744;-71.6385
