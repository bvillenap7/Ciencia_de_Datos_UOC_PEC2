Saucer hovering low to the ground.  ((anonymous report));2016-12-30 22:00:00;3 minutes;Saucer hovering low to the ground Was sitting in my living room when I felt the house rumble.  I looked outside the window and a large saucer with circular lights was covering just above the tree right outside my window, so close to the house I could see details--circular lights, tin colored, very sturdy looking.    When I called for my significant other to come over, as soon as he approached the window, the saucer flew off so quickly it was almost uncatchable.
