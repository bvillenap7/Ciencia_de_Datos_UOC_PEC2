pulsating light;2004-01-12 02:00:00;7 minutes;Our bedroom faces a wooded area. Awakening from sleep, I noticed a white pulsating light through the blinds on our windows. I woke up my wife, and she noticed ,too. The light filled the whole window and appeared to be from overhead, but I can't be sure.  The weird part was it went from bright to dim slowly, like someone going back and forth with a fader switch. By the time I was awake enough to investigate, it disappeared.
