Glowing lights over Worcester seen from Douglas;2013-07-11 21:15:00;8 minutes;Glowing lights over Worcester seen from Douglas I was driving home from work in Douglas going north toward Worcester when I saw 2 orange glowing objects in the sky.  At first I just thought they were planes but noticedthey were solid orange and didnt have the typical blinking lights of planes. I continued to observe them for a minute or so then lost them as I turned into my neighborhood.   I pulled in my driveway and got out of my car looking for them and didn't see them at first but then noticed one in the sky followed shortly by 2 planes flying directly towards it from the southwest flying northeast towards it.   At first the 2 planes were flying in parallel with one slightly behind but then the one behind fell in line directly behind the plane in the front.  They were clearly jets as they left the lines in the sky. The orange object rose into the any and then disappeared as the jets continued northeast towards Worcester.  I ran into my house shocked by what I just witnessed to get my wife and told her the story. I told her to come out and see the lines from the jets in the sky, upon going outside I pointed north to where we saw them and we saw 4 more round orange flowing balls rise above the treeline as if over Worcester and descending rapidly up into the sky only to disappear.  Both of us now shocked ran north across our front yard and noticed a neighbor out in his yard. We described to him what we had seen and at the same time we saw another one rise above the treeline and he witnessed it as well.  We all discussed whether they were flares or something else but all agreed there was no noise and it moved much too controlled and rose dar too high. I think we all erierly had chills as to what we had just witnessed.;42.0509;-71.7543
