Green light crosses sky at very fast pace.;2011-12-29 21:06:00;3 Seconds;Green light crosses sky at very fast pace. As I was on my way home from work I observed a very bright, very large green light cross the sky.  The object in question moved very fast over my car and across the sky as I was on the exit ramp of the highway I was traveling.  The whole sighting was only about 3 seconds until it was gone.  I was the only one in my car but thanks to facebook I have been contacted by others who also saw the object.;42.0509;-71.7543
