Are there LED powered spotlights?;2013-01-25 23:42:00;14;Are there LED powered spotlights? I was driving home 100% sober, I was traveling NW, and I saw between 8-12 lights that looked spotlights, the problem that I have was that there was no expansion of the light beam and it was brighter in intensity the higher in the sky.  The lights were equally spaced  and appeared to be in a straight line or file. I first observed then to my left and when I finished driving the lights were to the right of me I was traveling on a mostly straight road.  The closest I can come to explaining this is that maybe there's new LED spotlights that I have never heard of or seen before.
