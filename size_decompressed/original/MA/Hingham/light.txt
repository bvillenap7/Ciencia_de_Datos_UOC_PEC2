While driving along Rte 3 South in Hingham, MA two of us saw an amazing meteor or something more local.  It looked like a large bright meteorite in the Southeastern sky.  Much brighter than a any meteorite either of us has seen and we have seen hundreds of meteorites. After a second or so it broke off into three trailing smaller peices that burned as brightly , though not as large.  The now four lights travelled behind the tree line and out of sight at a very high consistant speed, not appearing to burn out.  It left a slight 'light trail' it was so bright against an average to dark sky.;42.2235157894738;-70.8820010526317
