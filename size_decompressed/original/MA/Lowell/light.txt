A huge, round, red orb hovering in the sky;1990-11-01 21:30:00;20 seconds;A huge, round, red orb hovering in the sky It’s been years, so I don’t recall the exact date, or even the exact month, but I do know this event happened during late fall of 1990.  This happened on the outskirts of Lowell, in one of the more suburban areas along Andover St. At approximately 9:30 PM I went outside to take the trash out.  It was raining pretty hard and I remember it being exceptionally dark that night.  I walked out the front door with the bag of trash and around the back of our house.  As I turned the corner from the side of the house to the back, I saw a huge, round, red light hovering in the sky almost directly above me.  It seemed really close- maybe JUST  above the trees (and certainly below the clouds), but it made absolutely NO sound. It was large. if you hold a small paper plate at arm’s length in front of you while looking at the sky, that’s about the size.  The light was deep red, like a stop light, and in the 20 seconds I watched it, it didn’t flicker, fade, or pulse.  It was solid.  I remember thinking how strange it was that it was just glowing with no portion of the circle being any brighter than another and had no different characteristics - just one massive, solid, glowing orb in the sky. At some point, I looked away to drop the trash into the barrel I’d been standing next to, and when I looked back, the orb was gone.  I waited a few more seconds to see if it would return, but it didn’t. It’s been 20 years since it happened and I STILL think about it all the time, as if it just happened yesterday.  Every so often I search the net but have never found much until now, when I found NUFORC.  Reading through this site, just the Massachusetts section alone, I can’t believe how many people have had similar experiences. On a side note, for reference purposes, the accounts I’ve read from July 4th 2010 and the subsequent videos all over Youtube from that night are very similar to what I experienced, except, in my case, the single orb was red, didn’t move and seemed closer to the ground (just due to the size difference).

 I observed, and also the driver observed, a round bright white light flying in the same direction as our car.  ((anonymous report));1991-06-30 22:00:00;~3 minutes;I was sitting in passenger seat.  We were traveling South bound Route 3 South near the Lowell Connector area.  I observed, and also the driver observed, a round bright white light flying in the same direction as our car was traveling at a low almost horizon level to the height of the raised part of highway we were on.  It was nighttime  and not a cloudy night.  The bright white ball of light made a very sharp right upwards angle at a very fast speed and I watched it disappear up out of the sky.  I will never forget this.  We have no technology to my knowledge that can make this type of manuever at that speed and be that close and make no sound.  Two people witnessed this.  The white ball of light did not blink on and off it appeared the same during sighting.  I am only now reporting since recently heard of new info about a govt program.  I have no interest in this only want to report what we saw. It still creeps me out to this day because I don't want to believe in this stuff but how do you explain this otherwise.  I would like to remain anonymous but hope this info helps in some way. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

single bright light in west sky above Lowell looped, dived , soared amd hovered, fading thwn shining;2013-10-19 19:05:00;several minutes;single bright light in west sky above Lowell looped, dived , soared amd hovered, fading thwn shining After 7pm saw single very bright light in west sky moving fast and odd,. Seen from hill on east side of Lowell Looking almost due west.  I first noticed the light through local trees and above rooftops, less than 45 degrees above west horizon.  It was a very bright point of light (whitish blue?  Eventually changing in intensity and hue, fading then restoring brightness).  It alternately zipped and wobbled in a confined area almost horizontally, then made breathtaking dives only to suddenly recover and soar back up to level hundreds of feet up.   I drove around hill a few minutes and saw it continue its antics, from a few locations.  this was absolutely no plane, jet, or helicopter!!!  Its speed, erratic eccentric stops starts wobbles...its flaring light fading and returning…  It was a mystery, but being in the direction of seemingly over the new north campus building area, perhaps it was new remote control technology.  The gforces and power source had to be incredible in order to dive amd rise so fast while shining dimming shining.

Quiet, fast moving light across the night sky.;2014-08-01 22:15:00;2 minutes;Quiet, fast moving light across the night sky. While sitting in my yard, I looked to the sky and saw a light moving swiftly across.  Planes frequently fly overhead, but this was different.  There were no guide lights like a plane would have, and there was absolutely no sound.  This craft was a single, white light (looks similar to a bright star) that steadily moved across the sky.;42.636185925926;-71.3161133333334
