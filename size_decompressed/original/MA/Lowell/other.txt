Parachute-like object drifting past window;2004-03-01 11:30:00;two minutes;Parachute-like object drifting past window I'm an elementary school teacher in a public school.  I was taking my morning break to have a cup of tea and sat on a chair by the window in the teachers room.  I noticed something that seemed to be drifting past the window (the school sits on a hill overlooking the city).  It was about 150 feet away. At first I thought it was a para sail,  but when I looked closely, I realized it was something that looked like three stuffed pillows stacked one on top of the other.  There were cables or wires that held a dark canister hanging beneath it  and seemed to be suspended from the sructure.  There was a teacher in the room with me, and I directed her attention to the object.  She went to the window where I was standing and watched without comment.  I thought the whole incident was very strange.  The object drifted, rising and falling with the general contour of the hillside until it passed out of site.  I don't know why, but I had the feeling that it was gathering information, collecting data of some kind.  It seemed to be under control and climed in elevation when necessary.  It seemed to maintain a level elevation.;42.636185925926;-71.3161133333334
Yellowish/orange object that darted in multiple directions quickly.;2014-06-19 21:10:00;2 minutes;Yellowish/orange object that darted in multiple directions quickly. I first thought it was an airplane but it was too high in the sky.  It was flashing orange/yellow colors.   It took off quickly and stopped just as quickly as it started, hovered for a few seconds and then took off quickly and stopped again, but in a different direction.  It continued to travel on in a zig zag form like that until I could no longer see it. ((NUFORC Note:;42.636185925926;-71.3161133333334
Stacked light formation;2020-07-15 21:00:00;10 minutes;Stacked light formation While walking our dogs, my wife and I noticed a bright squared shaped light slowly rotating with another squared shape light.  The two lights then proceeded to almost stack on top of each other & move east.  The formation then stayed stationary and two red/green lights formed a triangular formation with the stacked lights.  The light to the right of the stacked lights then moved west at a high rate of speed and was pulsating a dull light.  We also noticed that all the stars in the sky seemed to form a triangular formation. The big dipper constellation was also highly visible.;42.636185925926;-71.3161133333334
