In Lowell, Massachusetts sometime during the summer of 1978,I was 7 years old and home alone on a third floor apartment building.at 8:00 p.m. I looked out of my bedroom window into the western sky,when out of the left hand of my field of view,I saw a brilliant orange-red cigar or hot-dog shaped object moving @ a snail's pace,in a perfect linear trajectory from the S-SW sky,due N-NE over tree-top level.I got a real good eyefull that lasted a couple of minutes.I knew it was not a heilicopter nor an airplane.The object may have been large and in the distance but appeared large and elongated in the dusk-to dark lit sky. I was in a state of awe as I watched sun coloured torpedo like thing go across the sky.I also noticed that it was silent,no motorized noise or any sound whatsoever.My awe soon turned to panic after the thing passed beyond my sight.I telephoned my mother,who was doing laundry @ my grandmother's condo next door to the building I was in.She noted the distress in my voice and tried to comfort me.I had just had a close encounter of the first kind,as I found out when I went to my second grade school's library and looked for books about ufos,the book:UFOs and IFOs showed an artists drawing of the hot-dog shape I had seen and thought might have been a flying sub-marine.I was aware then that other people around the world and throughout history have seen the same thing I saw.;42.636185925926;-71.3161133333334
Seen over Lowell, MA, at top of Christian Hill.  Not a cloud in the sky.

At first we thought it was a shooting star, till we got a better look.  Bright neon pink, though the color may have been reflected from the sunsets background...no fuel trail.   Nothing else in the sky.  Was moving pretty good.   Finally lost sight of it.   Have four photos.;42.636185925926;-71.3161133333334
