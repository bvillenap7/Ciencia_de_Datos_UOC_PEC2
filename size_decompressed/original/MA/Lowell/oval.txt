Multiple orange globes traveled slowly across skyline then dissapeared;2008-07-04 21:45:00;15 minutes;Multiple orange globes traveled slowly across skyline then dissapeared Im not entirely sure what it was that myself, girlfriend, father, and several other witnesses saw this night, but after seeing the pictures fro Indiana on your site it has made me want to post this to say what we saw was VERY similar.  It started off with three to four orange in color globes moving across the sky very slowly. (Not sure on the direction, but if I went back to the site I could for sure use a compass to identify) At first we all thought it may have been helicopters or some other kind of aircraft, but as in the Indiana description as they went across the sky, they dissapeared.  After we noticed that the objects kept coming across the skyline, it started to draw our attention more and more. I would say about 4 objects had passed when I started to actually count as they kept coming. By the time the last one past, my father and I had counted 18 crafts, but there could have been up to 25 or so as we did not immediately start counting.  Others were joking that it was Aliens, and one man kept suggesting that it was just helicopters. Im having a hard time believing it was helicopters, especially that many in flight, in no distinct patters, flying across the sky at almost 10PM at night. There was no sound, just the orange globes traveling high enough and far enough to where it could not possibly be fireworks. And I also have a hard time believing that helicopters could fly as high as these crafts were. No way they were airplanes either, I know and have seen so many airplanes in the sky at night, and these were not. I dont care what anyone tries to tell me, this was something odd, dont know what it was, but they surely were not an airplanes or helicopters.;42.636185925926;-71.3161133333334
There was one green oval shaped light that was moving in the sky. It seemed as though it followed us. ((anonymous report));2019-01-24 08:45:00;4 minutes;There was one green oval shaped light that was moving in the sky.  It seemed as though it followed us from one street onto another.  Then it began to move from side to side.   It was outside until I reached my house, and then it was moving around near my house and I went inside.

Hovering UFO seen in mid-day on 495 in MA;2020-07-26 12:53:00;5 minutes;Hovering UFO seen in mid-day on 495 in MA My husband and I were driving on I-95 from Massachusetts to Maine.  We were on 495 near Lowell, MA at the time of the sighting. It was a clear day, around 1pm.  Just below the cloud line there was a bright white oval shaped object hovering.  We knew it was not an airplane because it was not moving in any direction- just hovering.  I watched it intently as we drove to monitor any changes.  It remained unmoving for several minutes before changing colors. It looked like it had rotated to show an underside of the craft, which was a grayish/black color. I turned around to tend to my daughter for a moment and when I looked back, it was gone.  I searched the sky and the object was nowhere to be found.  I took a photo while the object still presented as white, but I Unfortunately didnâ€™t think to record exact location information.  The information provided above is my best estimate of our location given the time that we left for our trip and the time the photo was taken.;42.636185925926;-71.3161133333334
