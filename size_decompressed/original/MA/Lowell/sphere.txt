The object looked like a metallic weather balloon, but it just hovered. the object was about the size of pea because how high it was it did not move just continually stayed in one position. I continued to look at it for about 20 seconds before a plane flying by passed in front of the object blocking my view for about 1 second. once the plane passed the object was no longer there.;42.636185925926;-71.3161133333334
