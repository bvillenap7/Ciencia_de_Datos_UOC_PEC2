Previous experience had taught me not to get mesmerized!! I awoke at 3:30a.m. I sat up and lit a cigarette and I noticed a peculiar light reflecting on some furniture across from me. I recall thinking, that this was odd, because, there was no beam coming through the window. Just a dull vertical light reflecting on an upright cabinet. I finished my cigarette and lay down, once again. Then I heard a faint, electrical crackling sound. I arose, and went to the window. I dept my hand on the shade pull, because in 1991, while living in an adjacent town in an apartment situated on the perimeter, of the state forest I had experienced two traumatic experiences, which have left an indlible mind imprint. This, is why I approached the window in a cautionary manner. This, is the reason why I grasped the shade pull fully exposing myself, fully at the window to whatever, may be outside. i am glad that I made this descret maneuver, for above the next door house was a large, rectangular shape. It was a very, bright, very white glowing object. It gave the appearance of being created from New England milk glass, which was popular in these parts, during the 19th century. I got the distinct impression that this glowing object was very weighty. I am not good with eyeballing measurement, but I think that it was about the size of two, large, sized kitchen stoves placed side by side. The object was very still...not moving a hair...just sitting there hovering, above my neighbor's house. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

Many of us saw what I think might be a UFO or UFOs when I got home from dinner with my family.;2010-07-04 23:00:00;brief;Many of us saw what I think might be a UFO or UFOs when I got home from dinner with my family. Driving home evening of Independence day.  4 People in my car, my neighbors/grandparents in another car, everyone is looking to the sky to see fireworks only when we turn on our street, 5 out of 6 of us see a large square shape in the sky with a light in each corner.  As I was thinking What is that thinking it was some kind of large display set up my mother voiced out, What is that? and her husband said A UFO sarcastically, we pulled in our driveway and I ran back to look again and the huge shape in the sky was gone.  My brother got there slightly before me and said that the lights just faded.  They had an orange color.  Then I looked around and I saw 1 more steady orange light that wasn't moving. I looked away and it was gone again. I feel like I'm going crazy.  It wasn't much higher than the rooftops and the lights weren't very bright but it was still, perfectly still in the sky and definitely had a square shape between them. About 30 minutes later there was one orange light moving pretty fast through the sky, much faster than I've ever seen a plane move.  Shortly after that there were two planes going the same route  but slower that were obviously some kind of plane or jet flying through the sky.  I think most people would assume that those planes were the four lights but they weren't.  The lights were smaller, white, and blinking on the last 2 that I saw that I could recognize as planes, everything else I saw tonight I can't explain or describe well because I haven't seen anything like it before. I'm hoping that these were just some experimental US aircrafts because I am really scared now.;42.636185925926;-71.3161133333334
