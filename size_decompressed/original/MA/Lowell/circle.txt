Orange ball like burning ember moving in erratic pattern about 5000 feet;2013-08-17 22:05:00;90 seconds;Orange ball like burning ember moving in erratic pattern about 5000 feet I saw an orange ball moving erratically across the sky it was traveling about 200 mph it looked like a firework that was ready to fade out but it did not fade out and kept moving across the sky over me and over the horizon it dimmed for a few seconds when passing over me then got bright again as it disappeared from my sight. It did not move in a straight line, it veered a little to the right and left unlike any airplane I ever saw.  No noise and I am in the state forest and can hear plane noise normally.

Strange orange object with trail appearing and disappearing quickly at civil twilight.;2014-12-01 16:45:00;2-3 seconds;Strange orange object with trail appearing and disappearing quickly at civil twilight. I was driving north on Route 3 near Lowell, MA, around 16:45.  I was looking up at the sky which was still well-lit (Civil Twilight), when I saw a single solid orange, circular, object appear out of the sky. It moved much quicker than an airplane and had a distinct trail traveling behind it.  The direction it was moving from my perspective was approximately a 135Â° angle, or between 3 and 9 o'clock if referencing a clock.  It appeared to be traveling away from me.  The object was only in sight for approximately 2-3 seconds. The sky conditions were partly cloudy but the direction of which the 'UFO' appeared was cloudless.  There were no trees or other objects obstructing my view of the object. My initial thoughts of the object was either a comet, or some other debris entering the atmosphere, but I feel it wouldn't just appear and disappear so quickly.;42.636185925926;-71.3161133333334
I was driving down MA-13 by Pawtucket Blvd. Heading toward Tyngsboro. I was just coming up on the big company on the right with the hug;2015-01-16 21:30:00;5 minutes;I was driving down MA-13 by Pawtucket Blvd., heading toward Tyngsboro.  I was just coming up on the big company on the right with the huge parking lot when I saw three low lights that were in a row, flashing a dim red and blue.   Since it's so close to where LGH is, I assumed maybe it was medflight but as I got closer I realized the depth perception wasn't right.  These lights were actually lower and closer so had to have been a lot smaller than helicopters.   They were all in a row until I started getting closer and then one shot all the way across the water to the other side of Lowell and hovered, one shot towards Nashua, and the other one I couldn't find.  The rate in which they travelled was nothing that I've ever seen.   My boyfriend and I left a restaurant in separate cars.  He was about five minutes behind me and he told me that he saw the same thing.   I tried to take video but my camera wouldn't focus.
