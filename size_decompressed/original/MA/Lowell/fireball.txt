6 fireball lights seen overhead;2010-07-01 21:10:00;5 mins;6 fireball lights seen overhead We were sitting on the front steps looking to the SSE sky, it was a partially cloudy/clear night, when we (me, my daughter and a friend) first noticed one bright fireball shaped light in the sky followed quickly by 2 additional objects flying at the same speed and spaced evenly apart.    We continued watching more continued to follow 6 in total.  The objects seem to switch directions, heading north and formed a straight line.    We were beginning to lose sight of them behind other houses so I ran to the back yard while my friend and daughter stayed on the street watching them.   Each one just started to disappear but the last one looked like it switched direction again and began fading as it headed East again.;42.636185925926;-71.3161133333334
Reddish/orange fireball/orb glided silently from north to south across the sky.;2014-06-21 23:15:00;3 minutes;Reddish/orange fireball/orb glided silently from north to south across the sky. 23:15  Redish/orange orb flickering  Dropped flair like objects Silent  Didn't have characteristics of plane Moved N to W to S (Initial report I wrote down right after sighting on my iPhone)  Got dropped off at my house when something in the sky caught my attention.  It looked like someone had shot off a firework but there was no noise and the object did not disappear/fade away like a normal firework does.   After realizing that it wasn't a firework I kinda assumed it was a flare of some sort due to the brightness of the object.  I quickly realized that it wasn't a flare when it the main object suddenly dropped mini flares of its own.  I immediately alerted my friends to get out of the car to see the object. It clearly wasn't a plane no noise, no blinking red/white/green lights. This sighting lasted for about 3 minutes. The object was orange/reddish in nature as like a ball of fire. It flickered  not like anything I had seen before. The object was circular in shape in the way of a fireball would assume.  The way it moved seemed like it as gliding across the sky by some alternative means. The object moved from the North to a Southern direction.  The height of the object didn't seem to high or low in the sky, relatively speaking.  Definitely at a planes altitude.  Hard to judge considering it was at night and nothing in the sky to reference to. There was only 1 main object (possible flares/objects being ejected from it that disappeared). Planes fly over my house/the area all the time. I can tell when a plane is going overhead. I nor my friends that witnessed this as well do not have any aviation background.  However I would consider myself proficient at plane identification (civilian and military).;42.636185925926;-71.3161133333334
