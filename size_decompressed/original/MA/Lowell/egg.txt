Blimp-like Craft crossing Lowell, MA super slowly... proceeded by Tactical Craft;2008-06-09 23:00:00;10 min;Blimp-like Craft crossing Lowell, MA super slowly... proceeded by Tatical Craft Looking out my window... a loud tactical aircraft buzzed over head ~1200ft (not strange). 2 minutes later, a low-sound buzz (up on high ~2500ft) caught my attention.  The Object had 3-4 lights 2 of which were pulsing off an on ever 1 second.  Most stange was the near-still behaviour. Moving, just, barely... the unit was traveling towards the east.. again, just barely moving. Hanging in the sky for nearly 10 minutes. Would not be surprised to discover this was some type of USHS-Blimp. Eventually drifted out of site headed East-NorthEast.  I shall be sure to photograph if there is a next time.
