I was sitting on the couch watching food network at 8:00pm on a Thursday night, I looked towards my neighbor’s house through my first floor window.  I was too bright and low to be a star and there was many lights grouped together I thought that was weird.  Then I had noticed it had started to rise like it was almost hovering over my neighbor’s house.  I had noted to my mom there was something like a plane in the sky she didn’t seem to care so I checked it out myself. At first I ran to the window and watched it move slowly over the trees until I couldn’t see it any more.  At this point I ran outside to my porch to get a better look.  It flew lower than an average plane and was quite quiet.  It had the high drone like that of a jet, but again it wasn’t loud my mom noted that she couldn’t hear it while she was inside.  I have helicopters that come over my house that transport people from hospital to hospital and they fly pretty low but not that low and are considerably noisy. As I watched it come over my house I noted that its bottom was in the shape of a diamond, and there were four white lights, one in each corner.  The light at the tail end was flashing a white while there was two smaller lights on either side.  Once it was more in front of me it looked liked the top of it was like a balloon, it was like the jiffy pop popcorn the kind that you put on the stove and watch it puff up. It took around two minutes to pass from my neighbor’s house till it was out of my side.  It moved to the North West, West coming from the North East.;42.5396;-72.6125
