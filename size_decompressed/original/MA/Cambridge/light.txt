Maybe nothing, maybe something?;2008-10-31 16:30:00;cum. 1 min;Maybe nothing, maybe something? I was driving west, home from work, in slow traffic in Cambridge MA and while looking at two jets and their contrails at about 30,000' I saw what appeared to be a silver orb.  It appeared and disappeared within 3-5 seconds.  I categorized it as probably another jet with the sun reflecting off it's fusilage as it banked, although there was no contrail.   Several miles later I saw another one (or the same one again) also for just a few seconds.  I still didn't think much of it, until minutes later when I saw three helicopters: two flying east about 1000 feet apart at 5,000' 1 yellow 2 seater, the other navy blue/white ~6 seater, and the third flying north -I couldn't see the colors too well through the trees, but it was a dark color and small.  About 15 minutes after that, I watched a military jet (F16?) flying very slowly at around 12,000' - 15,000' southwest to northeast.  I wanted to report this in case someone else saw more than I did. Thanks for running this site despite the immature youth making it difficult!   Children, stop screwing around this is serious business!;42.3707105263159;-71.1048343249427
