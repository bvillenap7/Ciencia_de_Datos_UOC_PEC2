Silver boomerang, slight shine above Cambridge, MA at 5:50pm.;2009-03-04 17:50:00;5-8 minutes;Silver boomerang, slight shine above Cambridge, MA at 5:50pm. I came up from the T station underground, and looked up to see a silver boomerang shape hovering high up in the sky.  I stared at it, then looked behind me at the moon and a bright star (to make sure my eyes weren't playing tricks on me), then turned back around, and saw the object still there.  A plane then passed by it at a lower altitude, and I was stunned to realize it truly wasn't moving.  I have never seen anything like this.  Silver, boomerang and slightly shiny. It was twilight (5:50 pm).;42.3707105263159;-71.1048343249427
