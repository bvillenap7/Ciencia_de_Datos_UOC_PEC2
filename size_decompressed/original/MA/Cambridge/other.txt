I had not thought about this since it happened and we never told anyone..my brother mentioned it yesterday and our two other friends we havent seen in 20 years easy.   We walked along a path if you can call it that and we all stopped as we saw it and it saw us...the most striking feature was red eyes..glowing red..it had its hands on the ground and stood erect, it was standing in the path, it was doing something when we came upon it, we startled it and it startled us...it turned, looked directly at all of us and slowly walked away.  The dump had growth way over our heads, dry reeds and like that, when it left we heard nothing, an impossibility in the dump.  The amount of space encompassed by the dump was huge, we as kids knew our way around it, no one else really did, we played in ther all the time..we knew it well..   As I said I havent seen my friends in 20 years if approached the definetly remember it, the certainly never told anyone and will remember we agreed it was an orangutang, with the one unexplained item, the red glowing eyes...

Yellow and metallic Craft;2008-07-13 19:45:00;15 SEC;Yellow and metallic Craft Dear Sir, This is a belated follow-up to call I made to your organization July 17th.   At 7:45 PM on 07/15, I clearly observed a craft. This craft consisted of a yellow square approximately 10 feet high with a metallic band across the top. Protruding from this band the metal continued off the top for 10 ft tapering into a point. The texture, and appearance were incredible, as if it were brand new. ( If that makes sense)  My view became obstructed by a small low cloud , I kept my eyes on that point in the sky. However when the cloud passed the object was no longer there. I estimate the distance to be less than 25 yards from the window I observed this from. At the time I was looking out from a building on the 6 th floor. This craft had no lights, no visible ports just what I described above. I wish others had seen this, I told my Daughter, she thinks it was something Military. I can't imagine we have these capabilities.;42.3707105263159;-71.1048343249427
