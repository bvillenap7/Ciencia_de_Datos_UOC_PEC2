weird lights spotted over East Cambridge;2006-02-17 21:00:00;2 minutes;weird lights spotted over East Cambridge I don't know what this was but it did not seem to be a plane. It had three white lights shaped in a triagle. Two at the bottom spaced apart and one at the top and it was moving slowly across the sky. The lights were facing sideways so the craft seemed to be flying with its undercarriage facing sideways. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
