Jefferson Park, Cambridge Mass, 2 children sight 50ft craft-speak about it 30+years later;1976-06-30 18:00:00;1 minute;Jefferson Park, Cambridge Mass, 2 children sight 50ft craft-speak about it 30+years later Between 1973 and 1978 on a summer evening my brother and I (ages 3and4 to 8 and 9) saw a 50ft craft, 100ft in the air moving slowly and quietly above Jefferson Park.  Numerous colored lights lighting in a rotating pattern.  The lights themselves DID NOT rotate.  There was no cockpit or area on the bottom to act as one like a blimp would have.  It was round and somewhat flat unlike a blimp.   I told my mother and aunt who where outside and they dismissed us.  It was grey and don't remember windows.  It was light out and very easy to see but nobody else saw it or said anything. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));42.3707105263159;-71.1048343249427
possible fighter jet closely tailing an airliner.;2003-07-06 19:30:00;30 seconds;possible fighter jet closely tailing an airliner. I was sitting in a hammock in my backyard when a jet passed overhead at relatively high altitude.  It appeared to be a commercial airliner with 2 engines located at the rear of the fuselage.  It was flying in a SW direction at a high altitude, probably too high for it to have just taken off from nearby Logan airport (approx 10 miles away). As I was lazily sitting in the hammock while grilling dinner, I looked up at the plane and saw a smaller object flying directly behind it at close range.  My first instinct was that it was a fighter--it had the same general shape and was proportionatly sized compared to the airliner but from that distance, it was impossible to tell.  My instinct was that it was escorting the airliner due to some sort of hijacking incident.  I watched as the two craft disapeared from view (trees and houses block out most of the sky from the yard) and either the unidentified craft drew closer to the airliner or it appeared to due to perspective.  I went inside to check the news for any sort of breaking report on a hijack but nothing.  Now, 3 hours later, I'm still baffled.
