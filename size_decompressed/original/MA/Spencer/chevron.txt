V-shaped aircraft flying NW.;2015-09-06 11:45:00;10 seconds;V-shaped aircraft flying NW I was walking out my front door and noticed a strange sound coming from the sky similar to that of a helicopter, which is what I expected to see in the sky when I looked up.   Instead, I saw a V-shaped craft flying in the sky.  I was unable to get my cell phone out of my pocket fast enough to capture it on video.  The object was heading North West.   Note that I have lived at this location for years, which is between two airports (Spencer Airport and Worcester Airport).  However I have never seen an aircraft that looked like this, nor an aircraft that has ever flown the path that this aircraft flew.;42.2414;-71.9903
