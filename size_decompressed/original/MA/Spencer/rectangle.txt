Circular craft with 2 red and 2 green lights with a pulsating red-white let in the middle.;2014-04-14 23:00:00;15 seconds;Circular craft with 2 red and 2 green lights with a pulsating red-white let in the middle. Was driving by myself down Route 31 coming from the center of Spencer towards Paxton/Rutland are when a group of lights in the distance caught my eye.   As I drove closer I noticed the craft has 2 red lights and 2 green lights (one on each corner).   The craft also had a red light that seems to pulsate from red to white to dark red and back again.   A low, pulsating whoomp was heard as the craft moved across the field and behind the tree lines.   I attempted to follow the craft via Wire Village Road but was unable to regain sight or sound of the craft.   The entire even last maybe 15-30 seconds with the craft traveling at a slow pace across the sky taking approximately 30 seconds to cross the horizon.;42.2414;-71.9903
