Lights were at brief and bright.;2002-11-16 02:30:00;20 SECONDS;Lights were at brief and bright. On 11-16-02 I witnessed 2 bright white lights approx: 10 feet apart,similiar to aircraft landing lights,approx: 100 to 200 feet off the surface. The area is a partially wooded partially open ground for approx: 10 square miles except for the road. No structures in that specific area. I saw them as I stopped at the junction of route 49 and route 9. From the time it tyokk to make the 90 degree left hand turn they disappeared. I was an aircraft crew chief in the U.S.A.F. And familiar with the approach and landing of all types of aircraft. I am very familiar of the area that this event took place and know there is airport of any kind in the immediate area. The night was almost unlimited visability.;42.2414;-71.9903
Light traveling in the stars until it made a zig zag in the sky then flew off at rapid speed into the stars!;2019-06-08 00:33:00;15-20 seconds;Light traveling in the stars until it made a zig zag in the sky then flew off at rapid speed into the stars! As my son, wife and I were looking up at the stars late Friday night into early Saturday morning we saw this light traveling in the galaxy at a constant speed.  It was passing stars and at first we thought it was a shooting star but clearly realized it wasn't because it stayed lite and maintained a constant speed until it came to a complete stop.  It was going from West to East then stopped, went south for a short distance, did this zig zag in the sky and shot off rapidly towards the east until it disappeared.  Was out of this world for sure!
