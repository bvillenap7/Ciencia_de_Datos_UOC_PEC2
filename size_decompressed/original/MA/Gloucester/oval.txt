Glowing, fiery, hovering orb, lasting 30 minutes.;2012-12-09 06:30:00;30 minutes;glowing, fiery, hovering orb, lasting 30 minutes. glowing, orb-like fiery ball. hovered over Ipswich Bay in Massachusetts, about 3/4 the distance between Lanes Cove and town of Newburyport. stayed motionless about 200 feet above ocean surface.  I EVEN USED A PAIN OR HIGH-POWERED NAUTICAL BINOCULARS TO LOOK AT IT. IT WAS ABSOLUTELY FLAMING COLR, LIKE SUN.  had perfect edges. could only be described as hovering orb.  hovered for third minutes.  moved slowly towards town of Ipswich.  vanished. never seen anything like this in all my years at sea in gloucester. I  am an avid sunrise watcher and have spent years at sea and in nature. this was absolutely mysterious and frightening. witnessed by 4 people i know. all say the same thing. bright, shining, orb. pre-sunrise. 6AM to 630AM;42.6219;-70.6761999999999
