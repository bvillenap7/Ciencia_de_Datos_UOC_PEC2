I was hanging out with three of my friends in a walgreens parking lot and all of a sudden we saw what we thought was a police car's strobe/search light cross threw the parking lot.  We just thought it was a cop making sure everyone was behaving and not loitering outside the store.   We decided to get up and walk down the block for whatever reason. About seven minutes later, we heard a very faint noise above us and saw the strobe light again as we were still walking towards the boardwalk.  From what I recall, the light was white-colored (it was sort of like what a helicopter beam light looks like when they're searching for someone).  The beam of light went over us and we all saw it touch the sidewalk.  After this the ufo or whatever it was started to take off slowly then reached a faster speed as it flew off into the distance. Keep in mind that all of us were completely sober when we saw this.  Also, when we looked up we couldn't really see what color the actual flying object was, but it had a green square colored light on the bottom of it.  Behind the green square of light was the weird white-ish strobe light thing that would actually reach down and hit the sidewalk. The next day, I later found out that my friends from Rockport, MA, saw the same exact thing!  It freaked me out a lot that night, but I think it was quite the experience to see something so cool in the sky late at night like that.;42.6219;-70.6761999999999
