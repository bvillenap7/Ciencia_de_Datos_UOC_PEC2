3 spinning object or objects in day sky;2007-07-17 18:54:00;5 minutes;3 spinning object or objects in day sky i was sitting in my room when my mother called me outside it was sunny out partly cloudy i came out and she said look i looked up and at that point i saw below the clouds was/were these 3 metal objects that were spinning around in an axis when it spun i saw the sun reflecting off of it i couldn't tell wether these were spinning freely or if they were fixed they tilted up on the side i couldn't tell if it was turning or spinning over because of the rotation of the craft/crafts i ran into my room to grab a scope to look closer by that time it had already passed the treeline i proceded to climb on my roof of my 3 1/2    4 story house but failed because i did not have anyone around strong enough to boost me up ((NUFORC Note:  We cannot certify that this is a serious-minded report.

It changed the direction of its rotation in the air from flat to sideways and continued to spin uniformly I ran inside to grab my 3-9X32 powerline scope to get a better look but it had passed the tree line I attempted to climb on top of my 3.5 4 story house but couldnâ€™t;42.6219;-70.6761999999999
