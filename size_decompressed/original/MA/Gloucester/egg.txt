Egg shape craft with white lights.;2014-05-10 22:00:00;2-3 minutes;Egg shape craft with white lights. I was standing out on my deck and I saw an egg shape craft with 2 tail lights that were round and white in the middle with a red light circling the white lights it made absolutely no sound it just like floated over the rooftop of the house on the next street from my street and rose above the tree line and then it was gone.  It was flying low and had no sound so I knew it wasn't a plane or a helicopter the white lights and red lights were not blinking. I couldn't believe what I was looking at! It was very strange I live in a very populated area so someone other than myself had to have seen it too.  However, I have not heard or read of any other sightings of this craft for last Saturday evening.;42.6219;-70.6761999999999
