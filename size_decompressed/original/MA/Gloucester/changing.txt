2 triangles split apart to many stars and hovered near Orion.;2004-12-25 22:25:00;5 MINUTES;2 triangles split apart to many stars and hovered near Orion. I was out on my deck and I thought I saw an unfamiliar constellation.  The 2 triangles started to move slowly toward the constellation of Orion.  The 2 triangles somehow burst into several 4.0 magnitude stars that did not stop, but sort of floated near the belt of Orion.  I watched for about 5 minutes, then felt terrified and felt like I needed to be in the house.  I went in to the computer to check the Heavens Above website to see if there were any satellites in the area.  They moved slower than a satellite, and hovered, which I have never seen a satellite do.  After I checked the computer, I went outside (about 5 minutes had elapsed) and the area was completely socked in with cloud cover.  It was partly cloudy at the time of observation, making a precise report impossible.;42.6219;-70.6761999999999
