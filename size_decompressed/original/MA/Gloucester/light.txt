White light bobbing around sporadically for several minutes.;2000-12-02 21:00:00;Less than 5 minutes;White light bobbing around sporadically for several minutes. My children and I walked out to the breakwater at Lane's Cove after a real late dinner. Upon heading back, my daughter noticed a bright white light bobbing around in the easterly skies. It looked like a star, but it's motion was erratic,...never staying in the same spot for more than just a few seconds. It moved up and down, and jogged back and forth laterally. It disappeared behing the hill that leads up to Dogtown, and did not reappear.;42.6219;-70.6761999999999
