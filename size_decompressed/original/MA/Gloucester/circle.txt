On a clear night ,stars were out. It hovered in one spot almost like looking at something.

They were moving horizontally, vertically and at an angle. They got very close to one another at one point, looking as if they were about to merge and then sped away from each other at high speed. After about 25 mins, they seemed to lower towards the ground and we lost sight of them.;42.6219;-70.6761999999999
We were in awe and wonder what did we see?;2013-08-17 20:30:00;2-3 minutes;We were in awe and wonder what did we see? We had an 80 degree vision of the sky from ocean to inland.  We sighted 2 bright orange/amber lights move across the sky from the south to the north.  There was no sound emitted from the objects;42.6219;-70.6761999999999

After watching it for almost a minute it took off extremely fast and it was gone.   It was comparable to the Star Trek enterprise taking off into light speed.   Never seen anything like it, freaked me out a little.;42.6219;-70.6761999999999
Circular, bright craft seen.;2018-03-12 00:23:00;45 minutes;Circular, bright craft seen The object was in the WNW sky at about 65 degrees.  If you took 10 Sirius stars and made a circle of them you would have the approximate size and brightness.  It looked predominately white, with red and other colors inside it.  It zig-zagged in what seemed to be impossible turns, although it mostly stayed stationary.   At one point, the circle changed shape with the top flattened out and it looked like a traditional flying saucer.  Then it changed back into the circle.   At the end of the sighting, I saw what looked like a plane coming directly toward the object.  The object let the plane get close and then just vanished.  I saw the craft briefly on 3-12-18 at 23:15 for maybe 20 minutes.;42.6219;-70.6761999999999
