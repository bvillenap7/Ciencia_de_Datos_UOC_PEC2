At outdoor Dave Matthews concert, admiring a satellite passing by, when a fireball with a bright red flaming tail passed through the sky and behind the trees.  Many witnesses were pointing at it and screaming excitedly.   Shortly thereafter from behind us another similar object, red and yellowish, which seemed to be headed straight towards us but suddenly disappeared.  It was behind the crowd's view this time, so less witnesses saw this one.  Then right after that another much smaller red object seemed to fall straight down in the same area where the first fireball was seen.;42.0215;-71.2188
