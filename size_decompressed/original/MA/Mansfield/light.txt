Bright lights aligned with Castor and Pollux;2010-01-07 06:15:00;3 min;Bright lights aligned with Castor and Pollux I was driving west on 495 when I noticed two bright lights that were to the right of the stars Castor and Pollux.  They were completely still and did not appear to be aircraft landing lights.   As I was exiting the highway, I saw both lights quickly fade out one after the other.;42.0215;-71.2188
Two bright lights seen moving together at constant pace slowly dimming into darkness;2011-07-01 00:05:00;1 minute;Two bright lights seen moving together at constant pace slowly dimming into darkness Looked up in the south western part of the sky to see two very bright white lights.  Moving very close together (within a degree) and obviously brighter than the surrounding stars.  They moved in concert with one another as they headed north east.   Appeared after seeing one light move West to East across the sky.   The speed of movement was constant and the brightness slowly dimmed until completely dark.   Very strange looking no blinking lights just constant brightness.;42.0215;-71.2188
