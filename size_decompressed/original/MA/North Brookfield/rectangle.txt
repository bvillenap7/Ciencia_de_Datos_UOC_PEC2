While talking with my son, I'm looking west out drivers side window.  I see lots of planes flying high in the sky. Another object catches my eye. A flat long rectangular shaped craft with multiple lights side by side flying in a level plane at about 1-1.5K. The objects seems to be less than 2 miles from where we are. Moving slowly from west to east.  I ask my son what he sees?  I stopped the car and both of us got out to see what type of craft.  I turned off the car to listen, no noise.  We watched as the object started to take a more south east trajectory and it seemed as thou the object started to climb in elevation. What ever it was, as the elevation rose, the lights on it seemed to be getting dimmer the higher it got.  The lights seems to go out as if passing through clouds, but no clouds in the sky. Clear night.  From my stand point, the 1/2 moon was in the southern sky and as planes had flown through the moon light, you could see the siloghett of the plane.  This object as it flew through the mooon light could not be seen.;42.264;-72.0785
