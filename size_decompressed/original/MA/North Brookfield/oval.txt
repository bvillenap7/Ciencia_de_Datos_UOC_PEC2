Green oval flying through the sky;2016-09-21 21:30:00;1 minute;Green oval flying through the sky I was driving with my friends on a back road in North Brookfield, MA, when I happened to look out the driver side back seat window to see a green oval that was moving not as fast as a shooting star but faster than a normal plane, it was bigger than a plane and left a green streak in the sky.   I never believed in this type of stuff before this, I have never seen anything close to this.  It kept on flying, even after I drove past I told my friends to turn around but when we went back it was gone.;42.264;-72.0785
