Lights changing direction and disappeared;2013-12-07 16:00:00;5 minutes;Lights changing direction and disappeared I was driving the skies were clear and i noticed a weird little cloud that did nto seem right.  I kept looking and was wondering what it was.  I went about a half mile up the road and pulled off at the top of a hill.  The object was now further away and was a bright orange light moving away and eventually just diappeared.  While filming with my phone I picked up a second light in the background.  I have never done anything like this, but I cannot explain what I saw.  The video is decent that I took with my phone.  This was no plane and definitely not the setting sun hitting an object.
