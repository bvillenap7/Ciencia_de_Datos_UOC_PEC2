2 white 1 red triangular craft over Monson Massachusetts. Western Mass;2020-01-30 21:00:00;5 minutes;2 white 1 red triangular craft over Monson Massachusetts. Western Mass Went to take my dog Out to use the bathroom. I was telling my dog to go pee and she was the one who first noticed the object. Noticed that the sky had gotten cloudy out of nowhere because 20 mins prior I was out there ans it was clear. After noticing the clouds I noticed a wierd turbine type of sound and started looking for a heliciptoer or jet, and noticed coming over the top of the trees in a NE position. The sound never seemed to change. It almost stayed in my head for days. Cant totally describe it. was a three lighted triangular object. 2 white and red in the front. Seemed to decrease speed over the mountain and id say was at about 700 feet. Heard it til it was about 4 miles away. Seemed to be traveling really alow. Had eyes on it for at least 2 minutes. Strange thing is this happened to happen just after my phone died and had to put it on the charger. So had no phone to be able to record the event. This is the second event I've seen in the 2 years I ha! ve lived there. The other sighting was a lite colired orb traveling NW from SE. The orb was totally bouncing from N to S and E to W and back. Within 6 miles of Monson Mass, I grew up in Palmer Mass and have seen crafts over man made lake Thompson when I was 7 years old with my mother. And around that time, our neighbor across the lake seen many of crafts in Burleigh Park which has been featured multiple occasions on unsolved mysteries. Def an area full of unknown crafts here. Hope someone else out here has seen this craft as well;42.101;-72.3231
