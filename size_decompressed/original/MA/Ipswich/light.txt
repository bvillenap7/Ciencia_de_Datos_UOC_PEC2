My eyes kept falling on one light that appeared to not be moving, but it disappeared behind trees because we were moving through winding roads.  Once me and one friend arrived at my house we decided to check it out from the back deck.  We looked in the same area as on the drive and there was this extremely low, but further away light. It looked like it was kind of lightly flashing white maybe a little blue/red like an airplane would.  But it wasn't moving, just sitting in the sky in the same spot. Suddenly it grew brighter orange extremely fast, scaring my friend and me. Then as quickly as it grew bright it faded out and disappeared. My friend has never believed in things like UFO's or had a curiosity for the unknown.  She was absolutely shaken, in tears. You could tell she knew something wasn't right. A few days earlier my mother saw the same light around the same spot and just kept saying that wasn't a plane, that was weird.  I could tell she felt something was off.  I don't know what this circular ball of light that was wider than it was tall could be.;42.6842;-70.8478
