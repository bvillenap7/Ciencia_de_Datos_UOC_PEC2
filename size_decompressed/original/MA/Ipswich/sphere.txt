Spherical type objects hovering above the sky for long durations, rapid movement.;2012-04-30 00:00:00;40 Minutes - 1 Hour;Spherical type objects hovering above the sky for long durations, rapid movement. Bright orange spheres hovering in the sky, these objects could change direction at whim (Shoot straight up, darted from side to side)  Two hovered close to each other extremely bright orange.  At one point the bright orange would just stop and only the flashing white, blue and red lights could be seen. Others flew around with white lights on the bottom and blue and red lighting on the side with occasional flashing and a slight orange tint.  There was also one that was fairly large that just hovered for 30 minutes or so then dissapeared below the horizon.  Speeds varied for each craft.  At one point two crafts seemed to have nearly collided but hovered directly above one another for about 5 minutes.  You could faintly hear a whirring of a jet-like engine as one passed over.

Three orange lights above beach.;2014-11-15 22:15:00;5 minutes;Three orange lights above beach. After sitting in our car at the beach to view stars three orange lights appeared in the sky.   My friend and I, along with two others in a car next to us, exited our vehicles to get a better look.  For about five minutes we watched the orange lights move in an obscure fashion and slowly disappear in the sky one by one.   We spoke briefly to the people next to us who had seen it as well.  No noise was produced.;42.6842;-70.8478
