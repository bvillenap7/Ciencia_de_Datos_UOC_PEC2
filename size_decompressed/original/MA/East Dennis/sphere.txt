While staying at our yearly vacation spot, an oceanfront cottage (one of five) in E. Dennis, at 9:50 we saw an orange-ish, glowing, rather large sphere travelling towards the shoreline, then in a linear, but at times trembly, or hover-y path from left to right across the skyline.  It appeared to enlarge then shrink several times, sort oflike a pupil dilating and contracting. When it had moved to the righthand edge of our view, it appeared to rapidly move in toward the ocean, blinking out once, going on again, then snuffing out completely.;41.7448;-70.1648
