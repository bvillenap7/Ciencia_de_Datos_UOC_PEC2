Small bright object with red lights  in East Dennis, MA.;2013-04-09 19:30:00;1 minute;small bright object with red lights  in East Dennis, MA I was driving home from Mayflower beach in East Dennis, MA, at 7:30pm tonight.  I was on Rte 6A headign east when I noticed a bright, luminescent object with red lights around the center sitting stationary up in the sky above a gas station at the corner of Rte. 6A and Old Bass River Rd.  The reason why I noticed it was because if was as bright as those LED headlights that cars have now-very bright with a bluish/greenish tinge.  I slowed and then saw the red lights around the center. I couldn't tell if they were moving, but they were bright as well.  This thing just was sitting there.  If I had to estimate size, it would be the size of those tiny, baby Le Seur peas held at arms length.  I started to pull over by the Fire Station ob Old Bass River Rd. to grab my camera on the seat next to me, but before I could, this thing quickly moved off to the east towards Brewster, MA. I would say that anyone driving east on Rte. 6A would have seen this because it was so bright and stationary, then woosh! Sped away!;41.7448;-70.1648
