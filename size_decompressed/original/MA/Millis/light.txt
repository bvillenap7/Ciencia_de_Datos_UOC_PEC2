silent low flying light VANISHES;2009-07-21 21:30:00;2 minutes;silent low flying light VANISHES For the record, the follow event has happened on several occasions.  This particular incident I am reporting happens to have happened in the town of Millis.  A peer of mine and myself were walking through his/her yard and in the close distance saw a white spherical light was moving across the horizon.  The object moved in a straight smooth motion at a very steady slow speed.  After about a minute or two of watching the object, it suddenly vanished.  I did not see streak marks of light indicating it moving across the sky at an accelerated speed, however I suggest it went invisible. As mentioned before, the sightings have occurred on different dates and throughout many years.  A few of the objects have been seen in groups of two, but no more than two.  I have seen other objects (exactly as previously described) stay in the same position for more than a half hour not moving before it finally vanished before my eyes.  I am not the only witness to these events in the area.  I do not assume it is any kind of alien UFO.  I would just like to report the incident and see if anybody has experienced any of these events in the Norfolk County region of Mass.;42.17;-71.3651
