Seemed to be very close and low and dropping altitude. At approximately 21:30 on May 13, 2015, my son and I were travelling on Rt. 116 in Savoy, MA 01256.  A very large, bright white light shot across the sky in front of us.  Our view only lasted for a couple of seconds, due to the trees on either side of the road.  It seemed to be very low and close to us. It was getting lower in altitude.  There was no tail.  The color was pure white. We quickly continued a short distance further, where there was a much larger viewing area.  This was just across the Plainfield town line.  We could not see the light anywhere in the sky. My son said that he noticed that the object was lighting up the tops of the trees as it passed over them. It is in our opinion that if the light/object had maintained its course it would have made contact with the ground.;42.577;-73.0233
