A large beam of light in the back yard;1995-12-23 23:50:00;5 min.;A large beam of light in the back yard About 10 to 11 years ago (I was approx.11-12 years old) my cousin and I were visiting my grandmothers house for christmas. It was about 11:30-midnight and we were spending the night on the fold out couch in the living room. We were getting ready to watch a t.v. show when all of a sudden a huge beam of light lit up the back yard. We immediately shut off the t.v. and watched in awe for a few moments until we started to get frightened. We then woke up our grandmother who came out of bed and we all walked right up to the sliding glass door in hopes to get a better look above. All of a sudden the light started to pan from side to side. Thinking rationaly about the situation as I always do when wierd things happen I thought it might just be a helicopter. Unforntunately I had to throw that thought out the window due to the fact that it was absolutely SILENT. I wanted to go out side to get a better look, but I knew my grandmother wouldn't have allowed it. All of a sudden the light was gone and the craft had left with out a sound.
