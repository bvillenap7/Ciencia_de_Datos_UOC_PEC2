Erratic light zips around Martha’s Vineyard.;2021-06-08 01:00:00;5 min;Erratic light zips around Martha’s Vineyard. I was outside the other night getting some air. It’s fairly quiet here on Martha’s Vineyard…lots of trees and farm land. It was a starless night. Very dark. Then I saw what looked like a star, briefly,  to the northwest. Then it (or they?) did this sort of scattershot effect in a fairly contained radius. (Almost like those poppy fireworks at the end of a big explosion.) Then it was one object again, and it started moving erratically. Again, it was far away, so it looked like a star. But it almost seemed alive, going different directions.Then it went behind a tree and I couldn’t see it.  All of a sudden it was in another part of the sky to the south. Again, moving erratically like a living thing, but much faster. Then it went below that tree line and I could see it moving behind the cluster of trees. (Which gave me the impression that it must have been not enormous, but not tine either.  That’s it. Not very dramatic, but it wasn’t like anything I’ve seen.;41.3582;-70.7419
