Cigar shaped siting;2009-07-04 20:30:00;5 min;Cigar shaped siting My wife and I were out for the sunset on our porch. In the East was the moon.  Then I saw what appeared to be cigar shaped object above the moon from my perspective.  It was quite far away and moving quite rapidly across the sky.  If it was a jet at the size that I witnessed it, it would not be moving that fast.  There was no vapor trail, and it was silent.  We watched it move rapidly off into the distance.  Almost immediately following that, 4 F-16s followed and appeared to give chase.  That being said, it is also July 4th and sometimes the F-16s give air shows and the F-16s remained in the area for sometime after the object left which makes me question whether or not they were actually chasing the object or not.  I could clearly hear the F-16s but not the object.  I am an aircraft owner with 950 hours of pilot-in command time.;42.6793;-71.0169
