Large slow V shaped object making no noise flew overhead in Boxford, Mass;2001-11-14 19:30:00;5 minutes;Large slow V shaped object making no noise flew overhead in Boxford, Mass I am a 36 year old police officer and I was heading home from a night class.  As I got off Rt 95 at Rt 97 in Boxford, I noticed a very bright orangish colored light ahead of me to the west and at a distance of a couple miles.  It appeared large and very bright.  As I drove towards it, it was also moving towards me. After driving approximately 3 mins I noticed other lights and thought maybe it was an airplane afterall.  As we continued to draw closer, it became evident it was too large to be a plane.  I then noticed a shape through the trees and it was V shaped with lights down both sides.  I pulled over with another vehicle and got out as it passed over the road.  It made no sound and was proceeding slowly and took approximately 6 or 7 seconds to pass directly over us.  I would say it was approximately 350 feet long.  It continued south past us and towards the Boston area.  I have never seen anything like it before and wasn't going to say anything until I saw a special earlier tonight and was shocked because on tv they showed a depiction exactly of what I had seen.;42.6793;-71.0169
