Multiple UFO’s shooting up into the sky one after another.  ((Starlink satellites??));2020-03-20 20:40:00;10 minutes;Multiple UFO’s shooting up into the sky one after another. A friend and I were about to go for a run when I told her to look up at what first looked like a satellite.  We quickly noticed it was moving too quick to be a satellite.  It was a light going in a straight line and then it disappeared up into the sky.  We then noticed another in the same path, they continued and clouds moved and we could actually see the light going upward in the sky.  We lost count of how many did this but it was at least 15-20 things going in the same line about the same amount of distance apart and launching up around the same area . Pretty crazy!;42.2868;-70.8818
