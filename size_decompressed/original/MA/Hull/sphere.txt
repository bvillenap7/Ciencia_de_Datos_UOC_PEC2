Orange light seen twice over Hull, MA, Sept 2014.;2014-09-07 20:15:00;45 seconds;Orange light seen twice over Hull, MA, Sept 2014. My wife and I parked in a lot by the ocean in hull we spotted an orange light the size of a planes landing light it was moving slow and seemed to be low in the air.   As we watched, it stopped over the water, and then slowly changed direction slightly, stopped and remained motionless for a few seconds, then got smaller and smaller, then suddenly shrunk and disappeared.   A little over an hour later, we witnessed the same thing it was in the same airspace as we saw the same stars and it was a cloudless sky and lit by an almost full moon.   This object as it disappeared then flashed a quick flash of orange light and was gone.   This object made no sound and was not a plane.  I was in the Air Force for 8 years I know an aircraft.;42.2868;-70.8818
