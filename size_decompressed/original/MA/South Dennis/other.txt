3 sets of  multicolored flashing lights flew  silently over Dennis-definately not airplanes!;2009-06-17 22:55:00;5 minutes;3 sets of  multicolored flashing lights flew silently over Dennis-definately not airplanes! I was in my backyard last night right before 11pm when I noticed a slow moving, brightly lit w/flashing lights object coming from the NW ( Yarmouth area) and heading and traveling SE (towards Truro/Provincetown). The lights were in a straight line, were colored red,bluish/green and yellow and were flashing one after the other continuously. Within less than 1 minute, in my peripheral vision, I noticed another identical object following the same path and with exactly the same flashing light colors and pattern. These lights never moved out of the straight line formation which makes me believe that they were on some sort of craft, but I couldn't make out the shape. The only thing I can give for measurements is BOTH were about half an inch if I held my hand at arms length. While keeping my eyes glued to the 2 craft, another set of lights came into my peripheral vision from the left( also traveling from NE to SW following the same path as the previous 2-which were still visable to me). This time there were 4 lights in the shape of a square-with one light on each corner. The 2 leading lights were yellow and the 2 back lights were red. These lights did NOT blink and the square between the lights covered up the stars it passed. Again, this object measured 1/2 inch holding my hand at arms length. There was absolutely NO sound associated with these 3 groups of lights and they all continued on the same flight path, one after the other. The entire episode lasted 5 minutes from the time I noticed the first lights until the 3 objects were too far away to see anymore.;41.7137;-70.1578
