Noticed that a few dogs in my neighborhood started barking, which I thought was weird.  Looking north, I saw 2 round, cherry red spheres in what looked like a rhythmic dance.  It was beautiful.  The only color was cherry red, & there was a slow, rhythmic, pulse to the light. One I could see clearly outside the edges of a big tree that was blocking the sky.  The other I could see through the branches of the tree.  They did this rhythmic dance, like 1 went up & the other went down.  Then they'd come back close, then swirl around slowly. I watched this for 20 minutes, transfixed.  Then one turned & slowly went northeast, towards the ocean & lower Cape.  The other turned left & proceeded southwest, towards Yarmouth.  Both had that rhythmic, slow pulsing, cherry red light.  The one heading towards Yarmouth I observed until it disappeared at 1030 pm, when I came in & immediately wanted to make this report. Size wise, when I came in, I looked for something to compare it to.  Only thing I can compare them to is maybe the size of a small pea. It was beautiful.;41.7137;-70.1578
