LOW altitude I heard a loud humming noise, realized it was outside, went out on deck, looked up and triangle shaped craft with 3 white steady lights at points of triangle, no sound, also saw black helicopter (heard too) very near it... ran in to get our son, and came back out and both were gone.  Very weird.  Helicopiter did NOT have any kind of spot light on.   Son saw something similar in August in the outdoor shower one night. Bizarre to say the least. Both VERY low....above tree line.   Also saw orange fire balls heading towards Atlantic Ocean (heading east) in August a few times. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
