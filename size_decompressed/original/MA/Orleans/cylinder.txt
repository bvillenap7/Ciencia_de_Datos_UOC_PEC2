Very bright object from the west moving east over Orleans MA 7-31-15.;2015-07-31 23:00:00;2 minutes;Very bright object from the west moving east over Orleans MA 7-31-15. Just after 11pm, a very bright object appeared in the western sky, just above the horizon, moving to the east at just about the radial velocity of a satellite, which is what I believe this was, but it was burning with a very bright orange glow.   It continued to move east and at it did it continued to burn, but became gradually more faint after passing 90 degrees elevation.  Eventually about 20 degrees above the eastern horizon it faded out. My expectation is this was a satellite or space junk, re-entering the atmosphere, but I would think a lot of people would have seen it, and there would be some news about it online.  Instead, I see nothing so I am posting this. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));41.7756;-69.983
