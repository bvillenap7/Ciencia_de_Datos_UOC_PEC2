In the SSE sky (151 degrees), an intense light that appears to be a star, but it seems MUCH brighter.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sirius??  PD));2014-11-29 22:00:00;1-4 hours;In the SSE sky (151 degrees) there is an intense light that appears to be a star but after looking at it it seems MUCH brighter than all the other stars.  It appears as a swirling bright white light with red and blue and sometime green flashes.  It also moved slightly to the left and right and in slow zig zag movements occasionally.  It can not be a satellite, or a plane or a helicopter as the altitude is too high.  This could be due to distance but it is a very clear night and on Cape Cod there is no light noise in that direction. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the witness was looking at the star, Sirius.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));41.7756;-69.983
