Light would slowly rise, becoming more intense and then hover.  Sometimes they would blink off completely or slowly become less intense.   At one point they also appeared to move horizontally across the horizon.  Very similar to other reports of Cape Cod Lights seen over the bay.

White dots moving across the sky.;2021-07-09 21:30:00;Several minutes;White dots moving across the sky. Looking up I saw a star moving slowly across the sky. When that star reached another they both moved off side by side in a north east direction. Before they were out of sight another one went South west to north east. I entered the house and convinced my daughter and two grand daughters to come out. We witnessed 3 more white stars go South west to north east. And two more west to east. One changed direction to the north east from the easterly direction. The clouds started to cover the area until the sky was obscured. They all were white in color and non flashing. Far too high for a conventional aircraft. The lights from aircraft are much larger and aircraft can be heard long after being seen. These stars were silent. There was no visible trail. Much dimmer than the north star but about the same size when directly overhead.;41.7492;-70.0699
