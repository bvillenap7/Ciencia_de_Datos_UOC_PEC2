Moving lights on dark mass;2021-03-30 20:29:00;4 minutes;Moving lights on dark mass It was 20:25 on March 30,2021. I was drawn to go out side for some reason. So I went to get my coat and gloves. It was a clear cool night. I took a seat on my deck to enjoy the stars for a few minutes. A bright light, larger than the biggest star in the sky, made one slow flash to the right of the sky. Then 2 minutes later, on the left side of the sky,  a smaller light went from right to left and then disappeared, as if it was going around a round object.  It happened several times, in the same spot without moving, over and over, round and round. I text my son to come see but he didnâ€™t get the text until it was gone. This light show continued so I took a video of it. The rest of the night sky was bright with stars across the entire sky except in this one area, like a dark mass was covering it. Small static lights flickered over this dark area as well. And then it just stopped after 5 minutes, as if it just left. No noise, just gone. The stars came back in th! at area and I went inside.;41.7492;-70.0699
