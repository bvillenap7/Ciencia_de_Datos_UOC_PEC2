soldiers observe large unidentified craft as fighters give chase;2003-10-15 23:00:00;10 min;soldiers observe large unidentified craft as fighters give chase we were on a observation mission south of Bahgdad watching a project building and a rotory. Our platoon was adjacent to a railroad track in a fairly large feild in a 360 degree defensive-observation formation. The night was fairly quiet only a few explosions in the distance and infrequent gun fire.  As the mission was drawing to a close on of our soldiers broke his observation position and profiles himself atop the tracks. I go to his side to see what he is doing and to tell him to get back down. As Im standing next to him he points to the horizon. We wittness a large cigar shaped object almost at a stand still moving along the tree line approx 3/4 miles away. There were no lights on the craft and it was only visible through night vision. Many members of my platoon were wittness to the craft and the others were very aware of its presance.Before the object was observed the radios in our humvees lost frequancy hop and went all static. As we were watching the object three fighters came off station and flew directly to the area in a extremly high rate of speed as on a troops in trouble call. When the jets gave chase the object dissapeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));41.7492;-70.0699
