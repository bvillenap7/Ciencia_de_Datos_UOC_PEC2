Orange lights over cape cod bay and the Brewster flats.;2012-08-04 22:00:00;30 seconds;Orange lights over cape cod bay and the Brewster flats. Saw what appeared to be a fireball in the sky to our west above the Brewster flats. I figured it was an airplane and awaited it to fly over head as it was coming closer to us.  But then it suddenly reversed direction and moved away from us  heading westerly   About five minutes later it happened again.  Moved towards us and then away.  It did not appear to be an air plane because of the reversal of direction and the.  Rightness and color of the light.  It was very orange and lacked that blinking typically seen with plans or helicopters. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
