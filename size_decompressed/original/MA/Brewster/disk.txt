I was awake .Ilooked out my window and there was a bright light like a yellow fireball so i went outside to videotape it .  by the time i went out side the yellow glow went away and all there was left was a silver disc i captured on video .The disc looks like the shape of a shiny metallic tuna can it appears to be flat on the top and on the bottom and it also appears to be round like a can but it hovered above the treeline for about 45 minutes untill the sun came up and ithe image went out of range. The object looked like a metallic can like disk that had no opening it just i was startled at first and i could not believe my eyes but i was tired from not sleeping much the night before. others have seen the tape i showed it to them and they only saw  and heard of my experience after i videoed it and they dont know what it could be ..so its a unidentified flying object that i videoed in my back yard i thank you for your time;41.7492;-70.0699
