Strange craft emitting large beams spotted in Brewster MA.;2011-01-28 18:17:00;1 minute;Strange craft emitting large beams spotted in Brewster MA. We were driving down 137 and we saw a bright white light flashing through the sky from what seemed to be a car hovering for about 20 sec. but as we got closer we saw a hexagonal shaped craft.  It had tiny wings on the side and two red lights and two green lights, plus the head lights.  It must have been 250 - 300 ft. in the air and about 75-100 ft. in length.   We panicked and ((name deleted)) slammed on the brakes and pulled into snow rd. we drove about 1/10 of a mile and got out of the car.  The craft was hovering over a neighborhood.   About 3 sec. after we got out of the car, the UFO slowly picked up speed and flew over Feretties market and disappeared out of sight.  We then drove to the end of snow rd. and turned around and tried to find it to follow it but it was gone.  We drove home Immediately and told my parents.;41.7492;-70.0699
