2 dim orange triangular/orb.;2015-04-28 23:30:00;20 minutes;11:30 pm 2 dim orange triangular/orb. First hovering north west Cape Cod Bay.  Moving away from each other in consistent high speed.  Hovering.   Next, light shines bright from both of them as third orb appeared and the original two switched places with each other.  Third orb hovering very high above started a light pattern at each point of triangle.  Red,  blue, and orange.  Then original 2 craft started to flash the same light frequency and pattern.  They all shined a bright orange in unison heavily illuminating the surrounding clouds before moving in sync out of sight to the north east.  This is the 3rd time I have witnessed this occurrence in past two weeks.;41.7492;-70.0699
