Orange flickering light (like flame) moved across sky for about forty five seconds over Cape Cod, then vanished.;2013-10-18 22:35:00;45 seconds;Orange flickering light (like flame) moved across sky for about forty five seconds over Cape Cod, then vanished. My wife and I stepped outside to see if we could catch the partial lunar eclipse around 10:30pm.  We spotted a flickering orange light in the sky, moving at about the same speed as an airplane, to the west. The flicker looked very much like fire.   My wife suggested that the object might be a sky lantern, but it seemed too bright and too fast, and its course was very straight.   It moved for about forty five seconds, then disappeared.;41.6614;-70.2363
