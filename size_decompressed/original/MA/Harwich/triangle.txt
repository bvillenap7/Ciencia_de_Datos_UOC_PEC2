Arrow shaped UFO spotted over Cape Cod;2009-07-19 01:00:00;15 Seconds;Arrow shaped UFO spotted over Cape Cod My girlfriend and I were sitting on Buck's pond beach at 1am.   We had returned from the bar where we each had one drink.  There was no moon in the sky, making the stars and milky way very visible.  When we first saw the the lights we both said in unison  what the ___ was that!?  An arrow-shaped group of lights (4 in total) flew over us silently.   They were very bright at first but faded as they got farther away.   The craft looked immense in size and flew like nothing I had ever seen.  We waited around for another half hour but saw nothing unusual.  I have always been skeptical about UFO's but this was truly remarkable.
