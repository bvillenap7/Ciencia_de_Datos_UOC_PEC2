An odd cloud formation was discovered in two photos taken during a nature walk.  It appears to be a small, solitary vortex created by an aircraft or other object traveling at high speed.  It was a cloudless winter morning, and I donâ€™t recall hearing any aircraft, when I photographed some backlit phragmites against a background of blue sky. Upon later review of my photos, I noted the small bright vortex cloud in IMG_3842.  I created a cropped version of this image to get a closer look at it.  IMG_3843, taken a second or two later, also shows the same vortex cloud contours, but faintly. I am not suggesting a UFO caused this odd cloud, but would like to know if any similar images have been reported to NUFORC.  I had never before seen anything like this.;41.698;-70.0602
