They were going up and twards us but not making any sound then they cut north of us and disappeared.  Then a few seconds later 4 more came from where the first two originated.  They weren't moving in any type of formation or anything, but like the other two cut north and disappeared.  Then we saw a single one follow the same route.  We had a tower with a flashing light so we judged the altitude to be aprox 1000 feet and they objects we saw were approximately 2 miles away from us.  They were orange on the Bottem it seamed and red on top of the objects. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));41.7297;-70.1996
