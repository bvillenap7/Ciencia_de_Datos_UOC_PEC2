2 Bright Lights in the Southwestern Sky before Dusk;2005-12-15 16:15:00;15 seconds;2 Bright Lights in the Southwestern Sky before Dusk Driving home from work proceeding on 117 East, I noticed 2 lights next to each other in the Southwest Sky just over the tree line.  I first thought it was an aircraft, however the lights were remaining stationary.  I continued to observe the lights for about 10 seconds and then the light on the right side just shut off. About 2-3 seconds later the remaining light blinked off.  This was before dusk, so I don't believe that this was a sighting of Venus.;42.4368;-71.6115
