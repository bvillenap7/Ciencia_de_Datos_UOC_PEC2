2 fainted orange spheres mirroring each other until they separeated;2012-09-01 21:30:00;45 seconds;2 fainted orange spheres mirroring each other until they separeated I was driving on Jerusalem road in Cohasset Ma when I noticed 2 lightly dimmed orange lights as if you were looking at the lights on the opposite ends of a wing on an airplane, except these lights were non glowing red/orange.  They turned just like the wings of a plane until they turned so much they were one ontop of the other then they seperated.  I watched one fly away at an angle and at the end of it you could see flares coming out just like a rocket taking off until it dissapeared into the sky;42.2426;-70.8144
