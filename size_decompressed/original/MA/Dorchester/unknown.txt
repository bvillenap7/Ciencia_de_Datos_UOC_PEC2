He led another friend of ours along with myself through a small thicket of trees to a clearing just beyond a small baseball field. what we saw was the strangest thing, an almost perfect circle measuring approximately 60 or 70 feet across burnt into the ground. The ground looked like it had been boiled(for lack of a better descrip tion). the trees that had been there just disappeared, no charred hulks you would normally would find after a brush fire,just gone. the wildest though is the soil that exsist today is almost looks like lava but very brittle wich is completely out of character of the surronding soil. in fact the ground dirt is only a couple of inches thick due the fact that this location is on top of a large granite ledge. I would be happy to send a sample of this area to anyone who is serius about doing some kind of analysis on this dirt. I will (by permission of the land owner) give the location of this area for scientific (serius inqueries only) study.;42.2903402173912;-71.0763413043479
