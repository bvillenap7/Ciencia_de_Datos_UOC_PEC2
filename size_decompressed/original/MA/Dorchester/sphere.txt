Drifting, wobbly light moving quickly across the night sky and disappearing;2010-07-06 22:00:00;60 seconds;Drifting, wobbly light moving quickly across the night sky and disappearing Wife and I were sitting on the porch swing and noticed a very bright, drifting star - brighter than Venus by several magnitude - moving quickly from northwest to southwest.  Too fast for a plane, too quiet as well, not high enough for a satellite.  It wobbled slightly as it moved, but moved smoothly. After passing over our home, it dimmed and disappeared completely.   We stayed outside to see if it would come again - say on a second rotation if it were a satellite.  However, never saw it again.  Wife mentioned she saw it earlier in the evening hovering on the horizon.  Thought it was an extremely bright star.

Drifting, wobbly light moving quickly across the night sky and disappearing three days after 1st sighting.  ((NUFORC Note:  ISS?  PD));2010-07-09 22:15:00;75 seconds;Drifting, wobbly light moving quickly across the night sky and disappearing three days after 1st sighting Three days after our original sighting, wife and I were again sitting on the porch swing at about the same time when the same bright, wobbly light drifted across the sky.  Too quiet to be an airplane, too low to be a satellite, too fast to be anything I've seen before around here.  Moved from northwest to southwest again.  Took more time to move this time.   After passing over our home, it began to dim.  Then it turned red like a glowing ember for just a secon.  Then it dimmed out and totally disappeared.  Stuck around for a long time to see if it would come back. No sign. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
