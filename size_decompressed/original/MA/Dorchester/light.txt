First saw a point of what seemed like starlight move down across the sky, then left, then up then fade away. I and my boyfriend saw this.  Then he went inside and ten to twenty min later, two dim orbs of light, much bigger than a star, moved across from one end of the sky to the other horizon and fade away as it moved of into the distance.  It was a slow pace across the sky and the orbs followed one another in a linear motion.   Definitely not a manmade object.  The orbs looked as if they were behind clouds, as far as the dimness is concerned.  But it is a perfectly clear night. by the second event i was practically in tears, i was so happy.  simply amazing.   we have planes that are constantly going over boston. they all make the same noise. planes had been going over all night, but when this object passed it was silent. the reason i was outside - i was smoking a cigarette.;42.2903402173912;-71.0763413043479
