Big cluster of bright lights stationary way above tree line in Stow MA.;2013-09-30 19:00:00;20 minutes;Big cluster of bright lights stationary way above tree line in Stow MA. I was in the parking lot of a large supermarket. I looked up and west. I was a large clustered group of at least 10-20 bright lights.  They were high in the sky, higher than any tower or antennae could be.   They formed a disk or oval shape of sorts.  They appeared to be about 1/2 mile or a mile away.  They were stationary, hovering, in the same location.  I found it odd and pointed it out to at least 10 other random people in the area.  They all looked at it and reported seeing the same thing that I saw.   It did not change direction or shape or size. I viewed all this with my naked eye, and so did all the other people who saw it.  My phone camera and very low resolution and when I use it at night it takes all-black photos so I did not bother trying to get a photo.  I could only stay for about 20 minutes because I had to go somewhere.  I cannot explain it other than saying-- it seems to me that it was was an object that was flying and I, to me, it is unidentified.;42.4302;-71.5148
