Intermittently moving lighted object observed over a fifteen minute period.;2016-10-19 20:45:00;15 minutes;Intermittently moving lighted object observed over a fifteen minute period. Stepped outside this evening and glanced up and saw a stationary lighted object, I would guess it was at an altitude of about 15,000 to 20,000 feet.  The object then began moving slowly in a southern direction.  There was no sound. I got a pair of binoculars and observed three red lights, horizontally linear in arrangement.  The center light was blinking around once per second. My two young daughters also observed the object.  They each described it as being circular. I was unable to see this, the night sky was too dark.  Later we all independently drew pictures of what we saw.  Both girls drew a football shaped object with three lights. The object continued southward, stopping several times and then continuing. I was able to observe the object with binoculars as it moved farther away, even while it was no longer visible with the naked eye.  Eventually it was so far away that it was very difficult to see with binoculars and I stopped my observation.;42.4302;-71.5148
