It sat above the trees stobing and pulsing shifting from blue to green to red to white to orange. It appeared to be rotating.... I waited 15 minutes untill I was sure of what I was looking at and I could obviously see that it was moving ... I went to the building next to where I live and got my friend Mike to witness what I was seeing. Hes a skeptic so the first thing out of his mouth was  thats an airplane, andhe got argumentative about it. Then I told him how long I had been watching it and he was watching it very closely and said Thats not an airplane. It was at that point that witness number two arrived.... We watched this thing as it moved plused shifted in color and looked at times like it was splitting itself apart in seperate llights it then dropped behind the trees as two what I think were fighter jets moved in on its position then it took off leaving a trail of white light in its passing...;42.1845;-72.3608
