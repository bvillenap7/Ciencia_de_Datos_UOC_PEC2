Huge Orb soft warm orange 50 ft high 100 feet wide hovering over home;1989-06-15 02:30:00;5 minutes;Huge Orb soft warm orange 50 ft high 100 feet wide hovering over home I was driving home from work passing through Harold Parker state forest into North Reading having passed through the North Andover portion. On my left was a clearing of a handful of homes. I was drawn to look to my left and saw a huge orange sphere that glowed as if a soft warm light. it was hovering above a ranch home and there were cars in the driveways of that and other homes adjacent. The sphere i estimate to have have been 50 feet high and 100 feet in diameter as it hung over the right and left edges of the home. It was perhaps 6-10 feet above the roof. i slowed down to 5 mph and rolled the window down. It made no noise and was a steady soft warm glow.As i slowed to watch it it began to move in sync with my vehicle matching the speed. I estimate my vehicle was 15 to 20 feet from the house on the road. I continued driving and watching until i reached the edge of the clearing to where it became woods again. At that point it continued on just above the tre! etops at about the same 5 mph heading in a 10 O'clock position from my vehicle. About 20 years later i bumped into a man who lived in the same area and had a friend with the state police. He told me that the state police had been flooded with calls that night unbekown to me.I have a college degree.;42.5821769230769;-71.0954653846154
