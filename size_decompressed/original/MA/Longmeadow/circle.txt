Bright moving light with flashes around it.;2016-06-06 22:30:00;30-45 minutes;Bright moving light with flashes around it We observed what at first was thought to be a bright star in a clear night sky.  It was a bright circle of light and we noticed that it appeared to be moving slightly so we kept watching.   Soon we began to see bright flashes of light appearing in all directions around the circle and then the movement of the circle appeared more obvious as it moved toward the flashes (the flashes did not all happen at once but rather separately some were small while others were larger bursts).   Also, the circle would periodically fade out and then become bright again.  The smaller flashes appeared to be moving away from or coming out of the circle while the larger ones appeared to be static (these are the flashes that the circle moved towards).  We watched for around 30-45 minutes until the circle moved out of our range of sight.;42.0508;-72.5672
