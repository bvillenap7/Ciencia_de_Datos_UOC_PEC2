Fanny stebbins refuge, Tonight. Me and one other person are in our 30's. Fished a small pond and headed back on train tracks going to springfield .. I looked into sky and notice a bright white moving east to west, and I commented &quotHuh, whats that ?&quot My buddy looks up and goes oh it's a plane. I exclaim, &quotyeah but its not blinking and its white, pure white. No colors, no pulsation, nothing.. just white and round&quot   We both agree this is odd, we watch it move east to west , then it navigates at about the distance a passenger jet would be at. We watch it expected it to continue on. Keep in mind, no direct path, just like an object deciding it movemnet. Not a coment , or metorite. I have seen hundreds of these , as I am a sky buff. They don't just glow pure white, and stay constant. They don't.  It doesn't. So we watch as it seems to turn away and up, then in about 2 seconds, leaves twoards space, then disappears. Before it does , there is a small glow as it leaves, like some sort of burner. and then its just gone.  I can say surley, for me a total non beleiver , this has made me believe.;42.0508;-72.5672
