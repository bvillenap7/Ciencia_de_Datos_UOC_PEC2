Ashland, MA UFO  on Chestnut St.;2004-07-27 02:00:00;20 min;Ashland, MA UFO  on Chestnut St. While driving home from a dinner party my wife and I both observed a round silver disk about 30 feet in diameter that had landed in an open field off of Chestnut St. (Northeaster University Property). We both got out of our vehicle and approached the disk, when we go close enough we both touched the craft. It was very cold to the touch however it was glowing red to blue. I was able to see inside the craft through a small window and was able to see three small beings. All appeared to be sleeping or meditating, they did not respond to my voice. As my wife and I walked around this craft it began to levitate and eventually flew off without making any sound at all. My wife and I promised each other that we would not tell anyone about this encounter however I could not resist. If anyone else saw this craft please post something. It took place around 2:00am.;42.2546;-71.4564
