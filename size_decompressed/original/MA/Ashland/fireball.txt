15-20 Bright Orange objects Seen just outside of Boston, MA (Ashland-Hopkinton Area).;2013-11-30 21:30:00;5 minutes;15-20 Bright Orange objects Seen just outside of Boston, MA(Ashland-Hopkinton Area) Around 9:30 pm Est. Myself and my Mother and Father witnessed about 15-20 Orange spheres that looked to all be moving at the same exact slow speed across the sky, just above the tree line of our back yard.  They looked almost like a bright north star but orange and each one would show up and move across the sky from left to right and then after about 30 seconds of being visible and moving they would just dissapear.  They looked EXACTLY like the objects captured in a photo about a week ago in Bridgewater Massachusetts.  Bridgewater, MA, is about 45 minutes South East of where I live and saw these objects.;42.2546;-71.4564
