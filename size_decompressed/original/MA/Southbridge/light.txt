This light after about three minutes slowly moved away. (NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));42.0737999999998;-72.0302999999994

This may sound strange, I was just outside watching the meteor shower and as I was looking straight up at the sky I noticed what seemed to be a small star moving.   Now I've seen many meteor showers and this was not your typical meteor.  This object did not fizzle out, or have a tail.  It was very very high up.  It looked like a star that was traveling across the sky, I know this wasn't an airplane no airplane could be at this height and travel across the sky in a manner like this did.  It traveled till it looked like it had gone into the darkness of the sky.   It was 5:30 in the morning, we live near an airport which has given me the opportunity to see many planes land and such, Iam very confident in saying this was no plane.

A faint light as a star moved generally south to north. About jet speed but much higher. No color, just a dim light.  As it passed though, directly overhead, it flared up to a bright star light.  Like maybe entering the atmosphere.   Then dimmed. Then about 10 seconds later, flared bright again.  Dimmed, and flared once more before losing it to trees.   Another same average light, was moving behind it in a slightly different trajectory North, but no flaring.;42.0737999999998;-72.0302999999994
