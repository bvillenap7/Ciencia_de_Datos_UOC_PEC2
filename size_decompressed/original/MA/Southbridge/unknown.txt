Reoccuring visitations ? Senses altered.;1990-08-10 02:00:00;45min-2 hours;Reoccurring visitations?  Senses altered. This has occured a minimum of 3 times before but this event was the last and most vivid, although all ocurred in about the same fashion.I was 10-11 at the time. I awoke in the middle of the night to the sounds of what sounded like fast whispering, my eyes were closed so I assumed I was swimming out of a dream and hearing dream stuff, so I opened my eyes.  I heard the whispering with my eyes open.  At this time I knew the thing was happening again. It is strange and hard to describe, but I will try. I have this overwhelming feeling of guilt or saddness, or some sort of PHYSICAL-emotion that is either overwhelming or bad.  Gravity feels stronger or muddy-like, and every thing I stare at grows, or my eyes had telescopic vision.  All I wanted was for this to go away as soon as possible.  I would therefore go to my mom's bed and lay with her, staring at everything growing with this terrible feeling inside and outside of me.  Words and crying didn't seem possible at these times, so the other witness, my mother, was unaware.  I think I  cried when I was younger. All these events I thought were personal until one night a caller on Coast to Coast named Brian described almost the exact same events happening to him when he was younger.  I almost cried.  I say telescopic vision, he said things grew when he stared at them (he specified his mom growing, so he was probably feeling the same thing too and went to her).  He also said he saw those two white theater face masks, you know, I think the one is laughing and one was crying, up in the corner kinda just there, and I freaked out because I had one of those in my house, or so I thought. I swear I have a memory of having them but thinking on it for four years now, I am positive we have never owned that. That is weird. I swear everything I wrote is the absolute TRUTH.  I even left out my speculations so you will not dismiss this odd one.  BTW, is there a name for this phenomena, I would Love to find out or talk to someone with similar things.  Also I still get little drops of the emotion from time to time.;42.0737999999998;-72.0302999999994

We were already talking about sky phenomenon and were a little hyped up.  As we got closer to town I look up and was like wtf!!  That isnt happening again is it?  Cuz we've seen a craft before and she was like yes I see it.  All we saw was flames coulda been exhaust from a plane, but it was single engine and going fast really fast, faster than all the planes around that we've seen so far that night.  There was no sound or sonic boom.  It was gone within 10 seconds of seeing it.  Did anyone else catch it too that night?;42.0737999999998;-72.0302999999994
