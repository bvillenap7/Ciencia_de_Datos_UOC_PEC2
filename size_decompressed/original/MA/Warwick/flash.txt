We do not know what we saw!;2014-08-25 22:05:00;25;We do not know what we saw! We were sitting outside when my brother said look above the screen house,  When I looked I saw a red light similar to a tower light blinking.  We both observed the light and the flashing was erridic, no pattern.  My brother went into the house and brought out his son and wife who both observed the red light.  The light originally moved west to east but then moved east to west, the light would stop and remain motionless while still blinking for 3 to 4 minutes at a time.  We all agreed that there we could not identify what we saw mabee a drone, mabee a ufo.  We are hoping that someone else saw these lights.
