Spherical steady moving object seen over Salisbury Beach;2013-07-05 01:32:00;~80 seconds;Spherical steady moving object seen over Salisbury Beach At roughly 1:30 am on the morning of July 5th, my wife and I took the dog down to the beach after watching the fireworks.  It was very dark on the beach and the sky was amazingly clear.   We laid down on the sand to look at the sky, and I saw a shooting star. My wife was upset that she missed it because she was looking in a different area.  About 3 minutes later she said, Is that one?? but she quickly realized it wasn't.   I saw the object she was looking at and it looked similar to a star and it looked to be a pale yellow in color but much larger and obviously much lower.   I reached in my pocket for my phone to film it and remembered I had left it at home to charge.  It was moving at a steady rate from what seemed like South to North, but I'm not great with direction.  After about 25 seconds of watching, it looked like it kind of zig zagged or vibrated at the same time, both of us said, Whoa, at the same time.   It only did that for maybe a second or two then went straight at a steady speed for another 20 seconds or so and then did the zig zag thing again.   We both sat silent in amazement until it disappeared about 20 seconds or so after that.  It was the weirdest feeling I ever had and I'm still not quite sure what to think.;42.8559;-70.8618
