3 Lights moving together at night over Cape Cod at low altitude without making any sound at all.;2010-10-23 21:20:00;3 minutes;3 Lights moving together at night over Cape Cod at low altitude without making any sound at all. On Saturday Oct. 23 at 9:20 PM while unpacking our RV trailer saw 3 bright yellowish lights in the sky moving toward me. We live near the Otis Air Base on Cape Cod and we are used to seeing airplanes and helicopters in the sky every day. I am also a licensed pilot and I am familiar with aircraft flight, landings etc. What I saw was not an airplane or a helicopter.  The 3 lights were in a chevron pattern with the right most light being the brightest and a bit further from the center than the left loght. I could not tell if these lights were part of a larger craft or if they were separate items.  I would estimate their altitude to be around 1000 feet.  As these lights moved toward me I called to my wife to come and look. She saw them too and asked what they were. As they approached we noticed that there was absolutely no sound coming from them.  If they were airplanes or helicopters there would be some sound coming from them but there was not a whisper of sound co! ming from them.  My wife was uncomfortable watching as they passed overhead and she stepped into the garage to watch under cover.  They passed overhead and over some clouds and we could not see them anymore.;41.7448;-70.6005
