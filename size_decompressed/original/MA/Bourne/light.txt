Series of lights moving west to east over cape cod.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-11 20:15:00;10 minutes;Series of lights moving west to east over cape cod We were observing the night sky when we saw a light moving from west to east, we counted 6 lights that were equally spaced moving across the sky, we may have missed some in the beginning, so there may have been more, they looked like stars, very high solid white lights.  Then another series of the same type of lights still moving east at a slightly different heading, still east.  We counted 11 in this series.  We live near a joint base on cape cod and know aircraft, these objects were very high,  I have never seen anything like this.  Could it be satellites?;41.7448;-70.6005
