We were sitting at our campsite by the Cape Cod Canal in Bourne, MA, and we saw two objects flying above the canal.  They were orange in color and closely resembled the flame of a candle.  They proceeded to fly down the canal and no engine noise could be heard.   There were three of us who witnessed this.  One is a daycare worker, a banker, and an entrepreneur.;41.7448;-70.6005
