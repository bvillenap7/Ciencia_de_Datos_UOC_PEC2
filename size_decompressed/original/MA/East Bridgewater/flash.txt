It was thought to be a meteorite until  it happened again, in exactly the same location and wasn't streaking as a meteorite would.  Over a 20 minute period the light contined to flash, rhythmically, every 5-6 seconds.  At times it appeared strong enough to be a ground based, advertising spotlight, albeit very far away, but it never had a line of light from the ground.  It appeared to be approximately the length of a thumbnail, when held to the sky and it never changed location, although it appeared that the direction of the beam may have been rotating.  The sky was very clear, stars being visible, although there was some whispy, high misty clouds at high altitudes, which sometimes made the light appear a bit fuzzy and not so distinct.  Then, after observing it for 20 minutes or so, it got dimmer (still never changing location) and then just stopped.  We checked up till 45 minutes later and never saw it again.;42.0336;-70.9495
