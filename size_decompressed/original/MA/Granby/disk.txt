Saucer Shaped Craft seen by over 50 people Independance Day 1977, Granby MA;1977-07-04 19:45:00;3 minutes;Saucer Shaped Craft seen by over 50 people Independance Day 1977, Granby MA Independence Day, 1977.  Getting ready to watch fireworks at Mountain Park on Mount Tom (amusement park, no longer open).  Looking West.  Craft moved NW to SE, hovered East of Granby at between 500 and 800ft alt.  Close enough to see at least two figures through windows that ran around the edge of saucer craft, that appeared to be about 40' in diameter.   Craft hung for about 3 min, then tilted slight and raced off in a SE direction.  About 30 seconds later, two jet fighters appeared and went same direction.   The incident was reported in the local newspaper, but a few years later that issue was pulled and is no longer on file with library.  At the time, there was a follow up article that stated Westover AFB and nearby airport would not release radar records.  At least 50 people and perhaps many more saw the craft.  Consensus was it was most probably a secret military aircraft.;42.256;-72.5145
