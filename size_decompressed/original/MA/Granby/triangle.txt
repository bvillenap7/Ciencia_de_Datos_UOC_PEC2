I was driving on Truby Street, towards Taylor Street to the North East.  I look easterly behind the houses. 3 very bright lights. 2 dimmer lights on the side, and one central one. My first thoughts were that is must have been a C-5 from Westover AFB. When I got closer to the part of the road that allowed me maximum viewing, I realized it wasn't moving. It didn't look like it was moving going towards it either, whereas with C-5s or other planes they are going faster.  The object had to be about 100 feet in the air.  Once I got toward it, I saw a dark tail on it that was clearly more massive than the craft.  When I stopped and pulled over, that's when it started to slowly creep away and finally out of my view. It was massive.;42.256;-72.5145
