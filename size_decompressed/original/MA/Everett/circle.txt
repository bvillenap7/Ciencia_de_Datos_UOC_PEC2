Everett Mass 3 witnesses;2009-04-10 08:30:00;20 seconds;Everett Mass 3 witnesses while in a park on nicholes st in Everett Mass at 8:30 am on said date I was talking to my friend Chuck and his wife Dianne and I was a beautiful clear day and I look up in the sky and I said to them look at these two things side by side just hovering at the edge of space, but clear enough to see two circlular shapes as they both looked up,the one on the left in view shot out left and did a half circle formation and ended right back where it was, then in a matter of 2 seconds they went across the shy about 5000 miles, having the whole sky line in view, there was no way a plane could cover the distance these two crafts cover and they were gone.;42.415;-71.0527000000001
