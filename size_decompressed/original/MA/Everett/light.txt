Slow moving, flashing object at high altitude over Boston, MA.;2013-08-24 20:30:00;Ongoing @ 21:20;Slow moving, flashing object at high altitude over Boston, MA I sit in the window most nights and watch planes, helicopters and even the occasional blimp pass by as we have Logan Itn'l Airport within a couple miles of my home, and the Boston skyline as my daily view.  But tonight I am watching an object I can't identify track across the extremely clear, cloudless sky.  I also must note that the skies are extremely quiet tonight and I have only observed one other plane from my position coming in for a landing throughout this incident. I noticed what appeared to be a brightly flashing star in a spot that I had not noticed one before in the ESE sky over Boston.  I watched it, could not discern any movement, but noticed that it appeared to be flashing erratically with multicolored lights. Whatever it is, it is very high up.  About 20 minutes later I looked back up (I had not moved from my seat) and noticed that it had moved about a foot in my view across the sky.  I was able to compare it to a junction on a power line which is in the foreground of my sight. At this point I alerted my boyfriend who is equally stumped.  I checked the ISS position which is currently over the Carribean.  I checked Weatherbug.com for visible satellites over this area and found none. I've lived here and watched these skies my whole life. Planes that high up appear to move slower, but not that slow!  Currentl,y it is still moving at a barely noticeable pace toward the south. It is most definitely one of the brightest things in the sky, as I am in a very urban area with plenty of glow from the city, but can still make it out fairly easy.  It also seems to get brighter and flash quicker at times, before slowing down and twinkling steadily. It's now 21:40 and it's still making its way south and still clearly visible from my window seat.  Object was too dark and far away to take pictures unfortunately.;42.415;-71.0527000000001
Red/orange light.;2014-08-23 11:00:00;1 minute;Red/orange light. Was a very bright reddish/orange color, that just seemed to float there and slowly flickered out.  It was in the SW sky, at 9pm (est).   Totally clear night no clouds, and this thing was awesome!  By the time i pulled over and got camera out it flickered out.;42.415;-71.0527000000001
