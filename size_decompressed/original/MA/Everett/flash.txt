Flashing streak across night sky.;2014-03-26 22:15:00;5 seconds;Flashing streak across night sky While at work, I walked outside the garage bay door to bring in another vehicle.   As I looked up into the night sky I noticed a bright light moving really fast across the sky, close enough that at first I though it was a military jet streaking across the sky.  The bright light flashed 3 times and as fast as I saw the object streak into my view it disappeared.   I work in a building right on landing and takeoff zones from Logan airport In Boston and I knew immediately it was not a plane cause there were planes in view at the time moving at 1/10 of the speed of the object I saw.   Length of sighting was approx 5 seconds.;42.415;-71.0527000000001
