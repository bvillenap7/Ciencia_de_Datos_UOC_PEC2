2 Star-like UFOS moving in unison followed by another all going from S-N.  Then minutes later a 4th moving W-E at high speeds.;2014-05-20 20:30:00;15 minutes;2 Star-like UFOS moving in unison followed by another all going from S-N.  Then minutes later a 4th moving W-E at high speeds This oddly is the second report am writing within 10 days.  I've been observing the skies since I had a strange sighting in which I posted in the previous report from North Reading, Massachusetts on 05/10/2014.  I am hesitant to report this feeling people might be critical being that its is so soon after my first report.  Anyways, this anomaly happened as I was looking at the stars in the Peabody, Massachusetts, sky.   The stars were very vibrant that night with minimal forecast. at approximately 20:30 hours I observed 2 star-like objects moving at high speeds (as fast as a plane would observed 300 ft up)  These object were moving in unison together high up as stars would be and never moved away from one another.  The objects were moving from the Peabody sky towards Danvers which is from South to North.   Approximately 3-4 minutes later an additional star-like object was flying at the same speed and in the same direction.  Then oddly enough I witnessed a both object this object flying the same speed, but in a completely different direction from Peabody to Salem which is West to East.   These objects could be mistaken as stars if it wasn't for their high moving speeds but not as fast as a shooting star.  These objects were moving is steady as a flight would be but the distance from myself seemed to show that these objects were flying at astonishing speeds. I looked at the Satellite and Space Station travel path of this day which does not match these times and flight direction.   Completely odd.   If there are an explanation on these objects or if these objects are believed to be UFOs, I would appreciate if someone could contact me through my email ((e-address deleted))  Thanks you!;42.5334;-70.9652999999999
