Bright object disappears.;2003-12-27 18:00:00;10 min;Bright object disappears. We were driving south on RT 128 in the Peabody/Lynnfield area at dusk when I looked up and saw a bright light that appeared to be a star. I followed it as we were driving and then I just didn't see it anymore. Didn't move or anything -- just disappeared. Then a bit down the road (about 1-1/2 minutes later) I saw what appeared to be a huge light, almost a very wide chemtrail just hovering in the sky and not moving. We were moving, of course, as we changed direction on the road, it shifted from one side of the sky to the other from our vantage point but the object never actually moved. I eventually didn't see it anymore.  It was the strangest thing I've ever seen because I've seem chemtrails and this didn't look like an ordinary one. By the way, the sky was very clear. In fact, I could see the crescent moon. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));42.5334;-70.9652999999999
