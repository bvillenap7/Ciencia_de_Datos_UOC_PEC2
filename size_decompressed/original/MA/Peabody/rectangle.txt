Blue and red blinking lights, not moving, appears as a satellite.;2014-09-11 22:00:00;2 weeks;Blue and red blinking lights, not moving, appears as a satellite. For the past two weeks, me and my family have seen a square object blinking blue and red in the sky.  The object does not move at all, but seems to get closer to us each night.  It appears to be a satellite but cannot be sure.   We could make the shape of the object with binoculars, so I know it's not a star.  Has anyone else seen this?   From West Peabody, it looks like the object is over the Lawrence area. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));42.5334;-70.9652999999999
