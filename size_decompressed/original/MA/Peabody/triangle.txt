I was juggling a soccer ball in the street when i saw a this bright light off in the distance. i figured it was a plane so i ignored it for about a minute. When i looked up agian it was coming closer. As is flew over my head, it was about ias high as a low flying plane. It made no noise at all. There were three small white lights at each of the corners and a blinking red one in the middle. When it was gone, i just continued doing what i was doing. i am not making up a story.
