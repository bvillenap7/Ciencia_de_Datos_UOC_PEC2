We thought, gee thatâ€™s really weird, and continued to watch it for several minutes.  We continued our walk, looking up once in a while to see that it was still not moving.  After a few minutes we looked up again and noticed 2 of the lights had changed to green and were flashing and the triangle was moving extremely quickly in a straight line to the south. There was no noise during this time coming from the object.;42.0686;-72.5006
