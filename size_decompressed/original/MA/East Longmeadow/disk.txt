My husband caught sight of something shiny in the sky that seem to be so far up there behind the clouds far past where airplanes were going by. I took a photo through binoculars with my iPhone. It seem to be the shape of a saucer definitely metallic and kind of moved around a bit erratically but stayed in the same general area. We had seen something similarly about two weeks before this event. He was in a little bit of a different location in the sky but very similar.;42.0686;-72.5006
