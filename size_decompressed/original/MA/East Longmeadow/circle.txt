5  bright navigating objects in night sky;2013-12-18 23:00:00;5 minutes;5  bright navigating objects in night sky Just before my girlfriend came home after picking up her son, she called me from up the street a minute away and told me to open the back door and look up at the UFO'S.  I did.  She had already got to the driveway and came back with me.   We saw Five objects intermittently stationary and zig-zagging from low on the horizon to an upward larger object.  The movements very fast and not at all aircraft-like but with absolute direction and precision.  As each got close to the larger one, they disappeared until all of them had gone.  This happened in the south-eastern sky from our location. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
