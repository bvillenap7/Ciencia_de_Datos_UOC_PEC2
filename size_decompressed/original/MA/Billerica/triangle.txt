Triangular object in sky with lights, accelerated out of view quickly.;2009-02-24 19:20:00;10 seconds or so;Triangular object in sky with lights, accelerated out of view quickly. On the night of Feb 24th, my girlfriend and I were traveling down a local main road close to where I live.  She pointed out something in the sky that I initially thought was a low flying plane, but soon we both realized that it was not moving, but staying in the same exact spot.  It looked extremely low, and had 3 lights that did not blink.  It was night out, so we could only make out a basic shape, which look triangular, with a dip in the side. I stopped and turned a corner to my right.  My girlfriend saw the shape accelerate and move out of sight, while I turned.  As soon as I slowed down I looked and saw nothing there anymore, whatever was there had left.;42.5536747572816;-71.2672077669903
