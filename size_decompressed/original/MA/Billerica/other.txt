Huge shadow passing blotting out sun, causing short energy surge/ computer outages.;2003-08-26 09:45:00;20-30 seconds;Huge shadow passing blotting out sun, causing short energy surge/ computer outages. At approximately 9:45 am Eastcoast time, I was working at my computer (I have an interor cubical in an open office space) when I noticed that the lights begin to flicker a bit, and then suddenly a high intense surge of energy occured for about 2 or 3 seconds.  Some, but not all of the computers in the department shut down, some just flickered and remained on as did the lights.  Approximately 2 or 3 seconds after that another more powerful surge flowed through, and this time I actually pysically felt it, and this time it shut down the rest of the computers but the lights remained on.  I walked over to my collogues office, which is on a window side of our building facing south, about two cubical down from me, and half jokingly mused about another black out.  Then I noticed the expression on his face as he looked at me, his mouth and eyes wide.  He said it was like something passed in front of the sun, like someone or something walked by the window and blocked out the sun, a giant shadow!  But as he said this to me, he was waving is right hand past his his head as if indicating that something had taken a path through the window and past by him. The stange thing is that when the first surge began, my sense was that the light just above his cubical was the area that was hit, sort of the hot spot. I wonder if anyone else in the Billerica, Chemsford, Ma. area experienced anything unusal.  What ever my co-worker was describing had to be huge.

Weird shape with multiple legs extending from object;2019-09-22 08:20:00;5 minutes;Weird shape with multiple legs extending from object We were outside by our pool this morning when we saw something coming from the southeast and heading northeast.   There wasn’t any sound and the sun was pretty bright so it was hard to see the screen on my phone but I took 4 pictures as it moved.   I’m wondering if anyone saw this and if it’s just a hoax by someone or a drone.  It would have been seen from Burlington, Woburn and probably Wilmington based on the direction it moved.;42.5536747572816;-71.2672077669903
