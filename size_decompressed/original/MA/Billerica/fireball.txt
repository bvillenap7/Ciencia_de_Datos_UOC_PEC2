Three glowing red yellow fireballs without tails sailing straight over house same route.;2014-07-05 21:15:00;15-20 minutes;Three glowing red yellow fireballs without tails sailing straight over house same route. We were having a party in our backyard when approximately 9:15pm I noticed a good size fireball floating directly over our yard and house.   I called it to everyone's attention and no one could agree on what it was.   A second one floated by within a couple minutes...  We were all watching it glowing and moving at a similar pace that you would see a plane move but I don't believe it was anywhere near as high.   We were all talking about it for the next 5-10,minutes and a third one came over.   Same as last two...and it was the last one we saw...and we were out there until 11pm.;42.5536747572816;-71.2672077669903
