Two discs seen one loud one quiet.;2000-07-15 09:00:00;about 3:00;Two discs seen one loud one quiet. Although it was a long time ago, this whitness is pretty wired. I was out with my friends in a tent when all of a sudden we hear this really loud noise like 20 motorcycles in the air. This continued for about 5 seconds so we look out and this disk (we could see the outline) comes by with three lights in the center. Red, Yellow, and Green. It sped by and we went back in the tent speechless. Later, about 1 minute later, another craft but more quieter went by as fast as the other one. We were convinsed this was not a plane.

Rotating object with single red light.;2019-11-02 18:10:00;30 seconds;Rotating object with single red light. I was standing on my back deck when they noticed a odd shaped object coming from the direction of the Moon and headed towards my house. The object was rotating and appeared to have a single red light. Then it just disappeared from sight before I could take a picture of it.;42.5536747572816;-71.2672077669903
