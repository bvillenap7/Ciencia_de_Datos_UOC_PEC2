Stationary bright white object observed in daytime sky in Billerica, MA;2013-11-16 16:00:00;2 hours;Stationary bright white object observed in daytime sky in Billerica, MA While my wife and I were talking in a middle school parking lot during halftime of my son's basketball game, I noticed a white light in the daytime sky.   As it was too early for stars, I assumed it was an aircraft.  But my wife and I observed it for the next 10 minutes and it never moved from its position.  It was extremely bright and its shape seemed to change.   We took pictures with our cell phones to try to zoom in and identify it.  When zooming, we also noticed it seemed to have a blue light at its right side.   When our friend arrived we showed her and she suggested it may be a planet.  When we left the game an hour later, the object was still there.   When we got home, we checked the position of any celestial objects which would be visible at that time, and in that position (relative to the moon and big dipper)and found none.;42.5536747572816;-71.2672077669903
