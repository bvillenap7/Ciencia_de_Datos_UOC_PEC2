We got a couple of good looks at it right then, though we still weren't certain if it was moving or not.  It was not a plane, there were other planes in the sky with their white and red flashing lights but this orange fireball was definitely not a plane.  It wasn't the right color, it was way too big, too orange, too low to the ground, and it didn't seem to be moving towards any particular direction or in a path. But that's not even the weird part.  We kept driving and joked that it looked like a giant meteor that was headed strait for our town.  I started to drive in a North-west direction, towards what we saw, out of pure curiousity.  Maybe 20 minutes later we were near the highway and we saw the light again.  Bigger and brighter than before it shined through the trees.  As we drove foward and the trees disappeared to make room for the highway exit, two more bright orange lights appeared next to it.  Now, there were three of these lights in a row, similar to orions belt, two of them in line with each other and the other slightly off-center.  The two on the ends were not as bright as the one in the middle which looked slightly bigger than the others.  I really couldn't tell how far away the lights actually were because they were so bright.  All three of us saw the same thing.  This was by Route 3 in Billerica.;42.5536747572816;-71.2672077669903
