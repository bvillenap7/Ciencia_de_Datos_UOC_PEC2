These could not be seen without binoclars. I have also observed on a few occassions a bright yellow light moving slowly, and then pause, sometimes the bright light releases a small red blinking object,  the bright light will then fade off, or will travel in the opposite direction away from the red light. The last time I've seen this was about 9-12-97;38.0471;-85.3828999999999

Between the time 19:48 and 19:58 on October 7, 2015, I was sitting outside watching the sky, waiting on the International Space Station to pass from the NW.  As the ISS came into view, I immediately realized they were not alone!...  The ISS was traveling at a speed of around 18,000 mph, the UFO (a bright light) was traveling directly above the ISS matching its speed exactly and then all of a sudden it SHOT straight up and disappeared!...   I was on the phone with some family members who were also outside about 5 miles from my location and witnessed the exact same thing at the same time as I did.  We all at the same time said that was a UFO did you just see that?!?!...;38.0471;-85.3828999999999
