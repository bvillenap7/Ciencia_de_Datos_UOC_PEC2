Unexplained Light over Hardin County.;2003-12-20 23:45:00;5 seconds;Unexplained Light over Hardin County. Observed an unknown light traversing the sky at an undeterminable rate of speed.  The light moved from NE to SW in the span of 5 seconds or less before it was out of sight.  This incident occurred as I was passing the exact spot where I first spotted the triangular shaped UFO several years ago in the mid 1990's (I recently submitted this event, but have yet to see it posted) but this sighting occurred at a much higher elevation.  As I was driving down Hutcherson Lane at a speed of 20mph, a bright yellow light entered my field of view from the top of my windshield.  At first the light was travelling relatively slow, but then accellerated to a speed greater than I've seen any aircraft fly.  It crossed my field of vision in 5 seconds or less, traversing diagonally across my windshield in a NE to SW direction before disappearing from sight.  I've ruled out the light as either a falling star or meteorite due to the fact that every event I've seen or heard of involving one of the above details the object as possessing a tail behind it.  Besides, I've never known either of those stellar event to accellerate mid flight.  The object also appeared to be moving parallel to the earths surface instead of angular, as if on a crash collision.;37.6875224137931;-85.8743655172416
Bright blue almost LED type light transversing the entire distance of the distant sky in 2-3 seconds.  ((Missile launch.));2006-12-16 07:20:00;3 seconds;Bright blue almost LED type light transversing the entire distance of the distant sky in 2-3 seconds. I was driving home from work on Ring Rd. in Elizabethtown Ky.  I was listening to the radio...just watching the road in front of me.  It was 7:20 am.  It was dawn but not quite light yet.  The sky was still a deep blue color.  Clear weather, no clouds.  Off in the horizon at about a 60 degree angle from myself, a bright blue light appeared to come around the curvature of the earth on the left of me and continue on a direct course until it disappeared around the curvature of the earth on the other side of the horizon approximately 2-3 seconds later.  The color of the light was about that of a blue LED light that people use to decorate the hoods of their cars with.  It was deep, bright....almost neon.  It truely looked almost exactly like a LED light.  It could tell it was very far in the distance and high in the sky based on it's position relative to the horizon.  This thing was booking it.  The speed it must have been travelling to transverse the entire curvature of the horizon from one side to the other in 2-3 seconds is mind boggling.  Even at the distance I was, the light appeared to be about 3-4 times larger than a bright star in the night sky...ofcourse that's my own comparison, it was already dawn so there were no stars visible behind it to directly compare it's size to.  I was very far away and listening to the radio so no sound. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Red Ball UFO in Elizabethtown, KY in 2013;2013-04-01 22:00:00;3 minutes;Red Ball UFO in Elizabethtown, KY in 2013 About 1 year ago, I am not sure to the exact date, I was standing outside talking on my cell phone.  I am not sure of the time of day, but it was dark outside at the time of the event.  What I witnessed was a red ball hovering in the air at approximately 1500-2000 ft. elevation.  There was no sound associated with the object.  After hovering for a few seconds the single red ball divided into 2 separate red balls.  Immediately after separation the 2 glowing red balls flew around erratically in opposite directions for approximately 15 seconds before coming back together and forming 1 single object.  The red object repeated this process 2 or 3 times before disappearing.   I was standing outside by myself at the time, but 2 of my neighbors from up the street came down to where I was standing to watch this event bringing the total number of witnesses to 3.   We did not know what the object was as none of us had seen anything like it before.   The only thing we could we could classify it as was a UFO.;37.6875224137931;-85.8743655172416
