The red light appeared to divide into two red lights and the four lights formed a diamond shape.  We had to keep driving but as I was looking, it continued in a zig-zag pattern above the interstate and hills surrounding it.  The four lights converged into one large red light and then separated.  It repeated this another time until it disappeared from my sight behind the trees.  I could see the glowing red light from about one and a half miles down the road because of its brightness. It happened in an area surrounding the interstate which was hilly and covered with trees. There were some fields.  I'm not sure if the field had crops or livestock since it was dark.  The sky was cloudy, so I couldn't see any stars. It wasn't near an airport either.  Someone said it was a helicopter, but the windows were open and I didn't hear any noise.  It was also flying fairly low.;37.6875224137931;-85.8743655172416
