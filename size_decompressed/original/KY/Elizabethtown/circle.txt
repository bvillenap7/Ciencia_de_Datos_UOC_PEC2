4-15-05 small star-like object (not jet/plane/satellite) seen Elizabethtown, Ky. in daylight around 3:15pm which made a 45 degree turn;2005-04-15 15:15:00;3 minutes;4-15-05 small star-like object (not jet/plane/satellite) seen Elizabethtown, Ky. in daylight around 3:15pm which made a 45 degree turn I was wondering if anyone in the Elizabethtown area reported an unidentified flying object sighting on Friday, April 15, 2005.   Around 3:15pm as I was sitting at the stop light near the Mall I saw a very unusual object flying in the sky.  The object was not a jet or plane or satallite because it was moving very fast and then hesitated and made a 45 degree turn and disappeared into the distance.  The object look similar to a small star that you would see in the night sky.  I observed it for about 3 minutes.  It was small and not very noticable to the human eye.   I do not believe in aliens from outer space.  I do not know how to report this to the government.   There does not seem to be a government web site available for this. ((NUFORC Note:  The U. S. government does not maintain a website for reporting UFO's, although we have reason to believe that various agencies in the government follow the phenomenon very closely.  One agency has admitted to NUFORC that their personnel follow the postings to our site.  PD));37.6875224137931;-85.8743655172416

Flickering objects in stationary formation.;2014-09-04 22:30:00;30 minutes;Flickering objects in stationary formation We live approximately 6 miles south of Elizabethtown, KY, and approximately 16 miles south of Fort Knox.  At approximately 2230, on 4 Sep. 14, while walking my dogs, I noticed four bright objects, flickering red/green and hovering in the South/Southwest sky.    At first I thought the objects were aircraft on approach glide path to Louisville Airport (SDF).  They were evenly spaced and staggered: 2 aligned and higher in altitude, and 2 aligned at a lower altitude.   After observing the objects for about 5 minutes I noticed that they were not moving.  The objects in the southern sky appeared as follows:                  *                    *                                                             *                    *   I brought my wife and 16 year old son outside to observe, and to help me identify the objects.  We noticed a fifth object of similar size and shape flickering red/green to the West at about the same altitude as the other four.  We watched the objects for about 20 minutes.   The objects did not move from their positions and continued to flicker red and green.  Other air traffic moved througout the sky near objects.   Objects appeared to react towards aircraft by emitting a beam (very quick to the eye) and/or turning towards aircraft in an aggressive manner.;37.6875224137931;-85.8743655172416
