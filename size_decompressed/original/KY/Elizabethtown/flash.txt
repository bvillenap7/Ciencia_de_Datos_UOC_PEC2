It was high in the sky. The light flashed distinctive times in 3 places far apart in the western sky.  I had on HD type sunglasses at the time I saw it.  I could not see any craft such as an airplane that might have reflected the sun.  Also, the speed and distance between the flashes seemed to me to rule out an aircraft.;37.6875224137931;-85.8743655172416
