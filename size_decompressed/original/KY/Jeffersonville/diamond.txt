LOOK LIKE DIMONDS IN THE SKY FADING AWAY  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly Sirius.  PD));2004-02-17 21:00:00;30;LOOK LIKE DIMONDS IN THE SKY FADING AWAY THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR SOMETIME. AT NIGHT AROUND DARK WE CAN SEE WHAT LOOKS LIKE STARS MOVING. THEY WILL GET REAL BRIGHT AND TWINKLE THEN START TO MOVE AND THEN START TO FADE AWAY AND BEGIN BLINKING. WHEN THEY GET CLOSE THEY LOOK LIKE DIAMONDS AND THEY HAVE SEVERAL DIFFERENT COLORS. AT FIRST I THOUGHT THAT THESE WERE SATILITES UNTIL THEY STARTED MOVING CLOSER AND JUST FADED AWAY.
