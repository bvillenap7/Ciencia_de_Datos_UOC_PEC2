The object was first seen in the left side of our field of vision, first it was dismissed as glare, or a row of houses, because it wasn't moving. Then the object proceeded to cross our field of vision moving from north to the southeast. It appeared to be a large airplane, traveling close to the ground and close to us, it almost appeared to be a crashing airliner. The only problem with it being a plane was the absence of sound, nothing could be heard except the wind and passing cars. If a big airliner was to pass that close, you would definately hear it. The driver of the car and I discussed the fact that it looked almost like two or three airplanes following close behind each other,or as if they were connected, fusealage to tail. There appeared to be lights on the craft, with a higher concentration near what is assumed to be the front of the craft, than to the rear of the craft. Since the sight looked so much like a crashing plane, we kept waiting to see an explosion, while keeping a lookout for a landing sight, or some other sign of landing. Once the craft passed out of out field of vision, it was not seen again by us, even though there was ample opportunity to see the skyline in which it departed, once the trees cleared. The color of the craft is undetermined, as to the fact it was dark outside, but the craft appeared to be darker than the night sky, as if it were black, or some other dark color.;38.3334000000002;-85.4673999999999
