Orange/red balls of light near Louisville, Ky (no sound).;2011-08-04 22:00:00;30sec;Orange/red balls of light near Louisville, Ky (no sound). At 22:00 hrs approximately, on 8/4/11 my mother and I looked into the sky and saw approximately 9 orange/red balls of light.  They started in a Y formation going from south to north-west.  We also saw an airplane flying above, not near or around the objects (seemed to be unrelated).  There was no sound and they were moving faster than a regular aircraft.  One by one they began to disappear.  After they all disappeared through the tree line we could make out other lights, but were unable to tell if they were the same lights or something unrelated they seemed to be both white and the orange/red color.   After waiting around for a few minutes they didn't reappear.;38.3334000000002;-85.4673999999999
