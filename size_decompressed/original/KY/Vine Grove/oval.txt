I had gotten scared and went in side while the rest stayed out side for another hour just watching it float over our town it headed in a sw direction to rineyville were other people had seen it,  we later contacted the military FT KNOX Ky and they said it was just a plane (C-130) and we should not be alarmed.  we live by the base and everyone knows what a plane looks like!   this was not the last time this would happen here.   it is now 19 yrs later and me and others still see nonmilitary vehicles in the air that defy physics. and unlike tom cruse  this has not changed my belife in GOD almighty.
