Silent, very bright ball of light, silent, instantly disappeared;2015-10-24 08:00:00;3 minutes;Silent, very bright ball of light, silent, instantly disappeared First off, I'm not really a believer in these kinds of things, but what I seen yesterday (10-24-15) really has me at a loss.  While fishing at Salem Lake in Hodgenville, Ky, I happened to look behind me to see if anyone else had launched their boat.  Immediately, a very, very bright light in the sky caught my eye it looked like several powerful LED lights.  I stared at it for 30 seconds or so and just assumed it was a helicopter or plane and made another cast.  I looked back once again after approximately a minute or so and it had gotten closer and even brighter, but with absolutely no sound.  It was essentially just a silent ball of light moving slowly.  Out of nowhere, it literally disappeared instantly while I was staring at it for the second time.  While I don't know how long this thing was in the sky, from the time that I spotted it to it disappearing was around 3 minutes.  Anyhow, I have seen Chinese lanterns and what not and this was certainly nothing like that it was the biggest/brightest light that I have ever seen in the sky.
