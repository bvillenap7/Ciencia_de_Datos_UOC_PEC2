long snake/worm like horizontal multicolor shape jumping all over the place and into different shapes.;2006-08-07 23:00:00;hours;long snake/worm like horizontal multicolor shape jumping all over the place and into different shapes. I saw a multicolored star, which looked like a star with the naked eye, but, because it was moving more than just what some see as gravitational, I deceided to get my boniculars and saw quite a different sight than what I could see with the naked eye.  It was multicolored, red, white, green etc.   It moved very very quickly and did all kind of shapes.  It looked like a snake shaped but it was also horizontal rectangle.  It seemed to have a white circle on one end as it was moving so fast into spirals, figure 8, zig zag, and it was just moving into all kinds of shape as this snake shaped or worm shaped so called star was moving around and jumping around.   I have seen this before in the past and it is very curious.   I would like to know what this could be.  It is interesting that it looks like a star but what got my curoisity was the multicolor of it and it seemed to move the clouds as it moved down, down more than a gravitational force I think.   I also see helicopters that fly behind the mountain trees where I live which come late in the night or and early am, and they fly down .   I do not know what is behind these mountain trees, as far as I know it is just mountains but it is curious to me.   So, this is what I am reporting, a star that when seen with binoculars is quite different.
