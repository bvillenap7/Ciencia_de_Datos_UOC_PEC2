Very high in the sky then moved to the south. Was just watching the sunset and looking at the scirus clouds when it appared at the same altitude as the clouds and just appeared from seemingly no where. It proceded to move from north to south at a fairly fast rate. Much faster than a plane would appear to at the same distance/altitude. After a few secounds it seemed to make a right climbing turn and quickly faded out. The object was very bright and much larger than a comercial plane much like light on a polished metal object. note the sun was setting but I was observing from the opposite side as the sun so it was not a reflection.;36.802;-87.8286
Orange lights one object.;2013-07-10 20:30:00;40 seconds;Orange lights one object My stepson and I were drIving home after cat fishing at Lake Barkley in Cadiz, KY.  As we approached US 68/80 bypass, we observed two orange lights moving at a slow pace.  I pulled over as he video taped the object move.  It appeared to be one single object with two lights, but it would seem mind boggling because it would make the object very large. My step son estimated it was an acre long.  The object moved behind trees and then vanished quickly in the distance.  The video quality is poor because he taped it on a cell phone and there is no contrast.
