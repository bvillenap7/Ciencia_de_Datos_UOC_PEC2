Basketball sized craft spotted at night in Cadiz, KY.;2014-07-15 21:20:00;2.5 minutes;Basketball sized craft spotted at night in Cadiz KY In the eastern sky, 3 stationary blinking lights from white to red, 5 times faster than the lightening bugs.  No sound.   One accelerates upward, disappears.  The other two exhibit drastic turns and moves for a moment and then start downward at a fast clip.   They stay perfectly aligned side-by-side at a 45 degree angle all thru this, making me think they were a larger craft with 2 sets of lights.   When they reach the level of the house top across the road, one splits off and soars upward and disappears.   The other hovers about 20 ft above the street and I can see that it is a ball-shaped craft.   It stays in place with the white and red lights alternating, as I watch it for almost 45 seconds and then it soars upward towards its original place in the eastern sky, then disappears.   Not the first time I've seen them in that exact place, and there is usually a variety of sizes and shapes there.;36.802;-87.8286
