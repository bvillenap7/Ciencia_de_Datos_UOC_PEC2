Two bright lights.;2015-01-16 20:00:00;2 minutes?;Two Bright lights Saw to really bright lights in close proximity to each other while driving.  I said something about it and it vanished.   Pulled over to look again, and there was no evidence of anything in the area.  WSW sky area, and both lights were nearly as bright as Venus.   Appeared to be still. COULD have been landing lights on a plane, but the only aircraft I saw was nowhere near the area of interest.;37.4611755555555;-86.3233044444445
