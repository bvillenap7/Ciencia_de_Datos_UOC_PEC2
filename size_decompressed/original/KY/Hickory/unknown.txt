Strange lights were seen speeding through the night in Kentucky.;2014-05-24 21:30:00;45 seconds;Strange lights were seen speeding through the night in Kentucky. the weather last night was overcast with thunderstorms rolling in from the west-southwest.  At around 9:30 PM, we sighted one object heading to the southwest of our position.  The distance from us and the object placed the object around the county airport.  There were one to two light airplanes in the vicinity.  The object increased its altitude and its speed to avoid an oncoming airplane.  The flight path was a stretched out arc stretching several miles.  It increased speed dramatically and the light started to flash as it moved over the town and then disappeared.   We went inside to talk about what we saw then went back outside at approximately 9:36 PM.  Then we saw either the same object or another craft of the same type and it followed the same flight path and took the same actions as the previous object had done.   The objects were of unknown shape but they had a single bright orange light on them.  The same kind as a street light and as the light we have on the side of our house.  There was also a slight glow or haze around the light.   Attempts were made to capture the phenomenon on video but were unsuccessful.   We except for my 5 year old sister are all believers in aliens.  My dad was a storm spotter, and both me and my brother are listeners of coast to coast.   I don't know if this helps but we live close to a nuclear facility, and about 100 miles from Fort Campbell.;36.8484;-88.6814
