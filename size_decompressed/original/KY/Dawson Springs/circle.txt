Two small orbs seen hovering over Dawson Springs, KY at a great distance.;2008-08-09 18:45:00;7.5 minutes;Two small orbs seen hovering over Dawson Springs, KY at a great distance. the objects were too far up to describe in much detail.  There was one object that appeared to emit light or simply reflected sunlight.  The other object appeared only for a few seconds and simply appeared as a dark spot.  The lighted object moved only a small distance then stopped, moved back and then stopped and did this about 4 times before disappearing. I have taken photos of the objects as well.;37.1974;-87.6724
