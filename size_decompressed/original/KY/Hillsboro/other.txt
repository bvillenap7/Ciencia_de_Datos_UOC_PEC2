Unusually large & bright white light returns for a fourth visit.;2005-10-29 19:30:00;1 hour;Unusually large & bright white light returns for a fourth visit I was sitting about four feet from the window and noticed an extremely bright white light shaped like a bell in the southwest sky.  It was about 4 1/2 thumbwidths from the horizon and remained there for about 45 minutes.   It was at least 20 times bigger than the biggest star and about 30 times brighter than the brightest star in the sky.(I remained inside for most of the sighting and could not see any other stars or planes through the window-only this light).  I was watching when it started descending to about 2 thumbwidths from the horizon and floating west.  It took about 15 minutes to move so far west it moved out of sight.  There was no sound associated with it.  The sky was clear and the temperature was about 38 or 40 degrees Fahrenheit.  I have seen a similar light three times in eleven days.  On October 31 a relative of mine who lives about seven miles northwest of here saw a white light about the same size and intensity.  She went inside and came back out about 30 minutes later and it was gone.  The sky was clear and the temperature was about 55 degrees Fahrenheit.
