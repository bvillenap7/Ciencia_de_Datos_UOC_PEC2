Two orbs seen hovering in sky.;2005-10-18 19:30:00;1 hour;Two orbs seen hovering in sky. The light from the larger craft was so bright I noticed it while sitting on my couch and looking out the window which was 6-8 feet across the room.  I knew it was no star.   I went outside immediately and stood watching it for at least fifteen minutes.  The larger craft was so bright I could not discern a specific shape other than round.  It was in the southwestern sky and appeared to be a couple miles away or more.  The lower one appeared round and either was changing from white to red or was strobing.  They seemed to be at the same altitude as a small plane flies.  (I do not know anything about planes or altitude).   My husband and son also observed them.  Other than the lower one appearing to strobe they did not move.  The bottom one grew dimmer but they remained in place the whole time.  I thought at first that they may be helicopters but there was no noise whatsoever.   After watching for at least fifteen minutes and they did not move, I convinced myself that they must be stars.  However, my husband went outside about 45 minutes later and they both were gone.;38.2938;-83.6726
