Strange encounter with unknown craft.;2005-09-30 04:55:00;8 min;Strange encounter with unknown craft. I was two blocks from the corner of 19th and Kentucky Ave. I was heading toward the north side of the city.  It was earily Friday morning of the 30th about 4:55 A.M. cool and quiet outside.  I looked up to my right into the night shy and seen 4 large white lights in the air.  As I looked closer I reallized that they made A triangle patten.  One in front, one to right side, one to left side and one at back that was in line with the front light.  There was no red or green lights flashing on the craft and it was not moving but was standing still in the air with no noise heard.   It was not very high in the sky the reason I say that is because the highest building here in Paducah Ky is the Jackson house 20 stories high It could have been more then that maybe slightly less.  It was not A helicopter as there was no loud pop or click of the main rotor and no green or red warning lights seen.  As I am futher down the street I could begen to See The Shape Around The Lights.  The Craft was Flat black in color as in the latest stealth aircraft.  Yet it was not in the arrowhead shape of A F-117 nighthawk or the long triangle shape of the B-2 Spirit.  It`s dimensions I give as A rough guess were about 70 to 80 feet across in wing span and about 40 to 55 feet in length from the angle I got of the shape it seemed slihtly thick.  Yet it was arounded off at the three edges of the triangle shape.  At first I heard no noise but when I got to within one block I heard A very low rumble that seem to be behind and up futher then the craft itself was.  Then as it moved off to the southwest the noise I had heard was gone.  There was no noise what so ever as it moved off.;37.0528517241379;-88.6355206896553
Triangle shaped object with center white light and flashing red lights.;2010-09-30 23:00:00;3 minutes;Triangle shaped object with center white light and flashing red lights. We were traveling through a small rural area in Paducah, when I looked up and saw a light in the sky.  At first, I thought it was a radio tower light, but as we traveled further down the road I noticed that it was moving slowly in the sky.  We slowed down the car and it hovered slowly over us and then over the neighborhood until we couldn't see it anymore.  It had a big center light with three other lights in a triangle fashion.  The center light was white and the surrounding lights were flashing red. ((ADDENDUM FROM SOURCE OF REPORT)) September 30, 2010.
