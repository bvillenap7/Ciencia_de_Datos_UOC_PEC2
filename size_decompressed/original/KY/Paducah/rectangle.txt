I was traveling north in a vehicle at 5 mph and observed a meteor-type falling object in the north sky. Initial sighting was at 30 degrees above the horizon and it was falling left to right at 10 degrees from vertical. The oject was silver to white and was brighest immediately before it disappeared at 10 degrees above the horizon. In checking with the Regional National weather station the following day, they had other similar reports of the same meteor-like object, one from a location 50 miles to the north.  I am curious as to what I observed, since nothing has been reported in the local media. ((NUFORC Note:  Other sightings reported from Indiana and Illinois.  Possible meteor.  Article below from the The State Journal-Register, Sangemon County, Illinois:   ((BEGIN ARTICLE)) http://www.sj-r.com/news/Friday/f.htm Daytime meteor shower strikes county  No reports of damage from rare event  By JAYETTE BOLINSKI STAFF WRITER  Sangamon County authorities received more than a dozen calls Thursday afternoon of brilliant, firelike streaks in the eastern sky — a daytime meteor shower that is rare but not unheard of, according to a local astronomer. It’s certainly possible to see a meteor during the day if it’s large enough or bright enough, said Charles Schweighauser, professor of astronomy and physics at the University of Illinois at Springfield. I have seen one during the day, in the evening, years ago. It’s not terribly common, but certainly it’s not impossible. Reports of the meteors flooded the 911 dispatcher’s office about 4:15 p.m. The calls came primarily from residents of Springfield’s east side and eastern Sangamon County, according to Springfield police Sgt. Kevin Keen. At first they thought it was a joke until more and more calls began coming in, he said. We’re keeping our eye out for anything. None have been confirmed yet. A spokesman for the Sangamon County Sheriff’s Office said there were no reports of damage from the falling space dust. Commonly referred to as shooting stars, meteors are tiny particles that orbit the sun and typically are no larger than a grain of sand. The particles are called meteoroids once they enter the Earth’s atmosphere. They become visible, rarely for more than a few seconds, because friction between the particle and air molecules creates a blue or white glow.

There was no sound, and as it passed over our car, and moved away it left a yellow trail similar to a comet.  It was very bright.   The exact location was at 21rst and Broadway, downtown.  It was moving at a very high rate of speed also . As it got further away , it took on a yellowish hue.   We cannot be the only ones to have seen this thing .
