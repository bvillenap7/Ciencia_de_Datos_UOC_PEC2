White cigar-shaped object flashes a brilliant white light twice, then disappears.;2003-05-20 19:00:00;2-3 minutes;White cigar-shaped object flashes a brilliant white light twice, then disappears. About a month ago, my brother called me out on the deck of my house (in the back).  He said, There is a UFO out here!   I went out as fast as I could, since I am disabled and don't move very fast.  It took me about one minute to get out there...then I looked in the direction he was pointing (almost straight up).  Here is what I saw:  The object was approximately 1/2 to 3/4 as wide as a full moon.  It was definitely cigar-shaped and brilliant white.  It looked just like a fuselage of a jet with absolutely no wings.  It was traveling from about 030 deg (NNE) on a compass to about 210 (SSW), which is exactly perpendicular to my house as it is oriented.  (That is why I am so sure of the directional travel of the object)  I would estimate it was quite a ways up into the sky, approximately 3 to 5 thousand feet, although it is difficult to say with no other reference points.  The object made absolutely no sound.  The skies were clear blue.  It was near 7:00 P.M.   I first picked up the object at an inclination of about 80 degrees (azimuth 030) and followed it for about 3 minutes until it was at an inclination of about 50 degrees (azimuth 210).  It made no sudden acceleration or deceleration during the entire travel.  It then flashed BRILLIANT WHITE, so bright I lost sight of the shape of the object.  The flash was almost as big as a full moon!  About five seconds later it flashed a second time (identical to the first time).  Then the object just disappeared!  I have emailed a sketch of the object, but it really isn't very detailed as I didn't see much detail other than the shape of the object itself.  The sketch includes the object shape, the relation of a full moon in size, and the size of the 2 bursts of light that the object made, in relation to the size of the object.  This is the second time in my life I have seen something that is absolutely unexplainable in the sky.  (The first being in Mancelona, Michigan in 1978).  I used to be a UFO skeptic.  I still have not been convinced that these objects are extraterrestrial, but I can say with absolute certainty that there are unidentifiable objects traveling through the atmosphere of this planet.  I know there are more than one type since I have seen for myself two distinct shapes of these objects.  It is certainly well past time for our government to come clean on what they know about these objects.  If they think they are protecting us by cloaking their knowledge in secrecy they are mistaken.  The more data the researchers have to work with, the better the chance that these mysteries can be solved!;37.0528517241379;-88.6355206896553
Reflective chrome shiny metallic cylinder shaped thing floating from Paducah off toward the Brookport area.;2014-07-15 15:00:00;3 minutes;Reflective chrome shiny metallic cylinder shaped thing floating from Paducah off toward the Brookport area. This happened years ago...forgive me it was 2013-2015 in the summer.  I am not for sure the exact month but it was nice out...summer time.  I walked out the back door of my work and looked up to the west and saw a completely shiny (shiny chrome) long cylinder or I guess you could say cigar shaped.  It was probably 1,500-2,500 feet up...it was clear as day...but not if you didn't have a fix on it...but when I did pick it out in the sky I could see the shape and color perfectly.   It was moving north west above the mall area moving out the direction of Brookport, Illinois...that direction.  It just kept moving off that direction.   A coworker was there and I told him look...but he couldn't see it and I didn't want to sound dumb but I have always wondered what that was. I can still remember it clear as day.  The coworker looked but could not see it and walked back in.  Are our weather balloons shaped that way?  It made no sound and had defined cylinder shape.. reflective chrome.  I would say it was 20-30 feet long is my guess.  Ya see, the wind here blows in a north east direction,..it wasn't blowing in the wind...it was headed northwest.   I am submitting this because I noticed another person saw the exact same thing as me according to what I read of sightings in my town but this person saw it in 2017 years after me but they saw the same thing. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));37.0528517241379;-88.6355206896553
I noticed a chrome cigar shapes craft hovering about 3000' above the city.  ((anonymous report));2017-02-16 16:30:00;<1 minute;Driving into downtown on the I24 business loop when I noticed a chrome cigar shapes craft hovering about 3000 feet above the city.  After a very short time, the craft disappeared into thin air.  There weren't any clouds, fog, or haze of any kind in the sky.  It simply banished without appearing to move at all.
