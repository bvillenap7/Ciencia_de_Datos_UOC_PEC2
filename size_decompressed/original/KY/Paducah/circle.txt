UFO spotted in rural Paducah, Ky neighborhood;2010-07-13 22:30:00;10 minutes;UFO spotted in rural Paducah, Ky neighborhood Three teenagers were swimming in their backyard when they saw flashing multicolored lights above and through the tree line. The occurrence lasted ten minutes in about 30 second invariables. The lights would get almost blinding and then would go completely dark.  One of the teenagers came in the back door and reported the lights to the parents.  The teenager was at a loss of words as to what they’d seen and why the lights wouldn’t stop flashing. A brother of the teenager went through the front door to the front yard to see if the lights were coming from the front  yard to the back somehow.  The teenager from the pool continued to explain the lights to the parents as the older brother started back into the house screaming he’d seen a UFO.  Neither had heard the others description but both accounts were the same.  They’d saw multi colored lights on a circular object with load wind swishing sounds.  They said it wasn’t huge it looked smaller than they would have thought a UFO would be.;37.0528517241379;-88.6355206896553
