From my backyard facing in a southern direction at approximately 7:pm I was admiring the early evening sky and noted the usual bright body in the lower part of the sky about twenty degrees from the horizon. As I observed this usual body there appeared a second bright body similiar in size and brightness but was moving in an upward direction just above the other body. It passed the other body and then disappeared. For several minutes I watched to see if a conventional blinking light or sound would occur, neither did. I watched for approximately twenty minutes but did not see any recurrence or any other similiar body. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.
