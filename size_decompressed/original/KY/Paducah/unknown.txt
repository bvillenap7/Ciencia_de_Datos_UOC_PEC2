I noticed something that seemed like an out of place star only to realize that it was not.  Did not look round even though it was spinning in place.  Lights were flashing in a straight line gold-red-blue colors which made it look rectangular shaped, but it wasn't.  It was a crystal clear night sky and the object could be clearly seen.  I got my relatives to come out and bear witness that they saw what I saw.  I observed the object for at least 45 minutes and it was still hovering over my house when I went in.  The object appeared to be closer than it was far off in the sky.  I know that this was not a satellite because I've never seen one this close.  I truly believe that we witnessed an unidentified flying object, which is why I feel compelled to submit this report.  I gave as much detail as I could.  I'm still bewildered...
