Small light, first mistaken for a bright star, begins moving slowly downward in a zigzagging pattern, before slowly dimming out.;2009-02-02 18:30:00;1 minute;Small light, first mistaken for a bright star, begins moving slowly downward in a zigzagging pattern, before slowly dimming out. Yesterday evening, my boyfriend and I were about to go out and run a couple of errands.  As we walked through the parking lot, I glanced up at the sky as I usually do.  I first noted Venus, then turned to look at Orion (roughly to the East) and said Look, Orion! (typical behaviour for me).  To the left upper side of the constellation, I noticed a very bright star that didn't seem to belong there, but I shrugged it off and  turned to get into the car, when my boyfriend, who was still looking up at the sky said A UFO!  I turned back to see that the white dot of light that I'd first mistaken for a bright star was slowly moving downward through the field of the Orion constellation.  The light zigzagged slightly as it moved downward and toward the left.  The lack of blinking and coloured lights, as well as the pattern of movement made both my boyfriend and myself remark that it couldn't be a place.  The light was also far too small/far away to be a helicoptor.  After about a minute or less, the light had reached the area right below the constellation, when it began to dim until it had disappeared entirely.  We waited a bit to see if it would return, then got into the car.  As we were exiting the parking lot, I looked up toward Orion again, and this time I did see an airplane traveling northeast, though I doubt that was related.  I am a 23 year old female and have lived in Paducah, Kentucky my entire life.  My boyfriend is 32 and originally from Guadalajara, Mexico.;37.0528517241379;-88.6355206896553
Two lighted objects streaked across the sky.;2011-05-13 21:45:00;35 to 40 seconds;Two lighted objects streaked across the sky. Last night (May 13, 2011, between 9:30 and 9:45) my husband suddenly called to me.  Sensing the urgency in his voice, I ran outside. He pointed to the sky where two lighted objects were streaking across the sky.  They were very high.  He saw them come from the west, and by the time I got there (only seconds), they were overhead.  We watched them make an arc to the right and disappear behind some trees. The objects were traveling VERY fast.  My husband estimates it was 35 to 40 seconds from the time he saw them until they disappeared behind the trees.;37.0528517241379;-88.6355206896553
Four flashing stobe lights moving quickly in the sky.;2012-05-06 22:56:00;4 seconds;Four flashing stobe lights moving quickly in the sky. From approximately Olivette Church Road and Rte. 60 a light was observed descending at an approximate 10 degree down angle from north to south.  The distance and size of the object were not distance due to the speed, however, the light appeared to traverse approximately 3 degrees every second and flash 4 times at each second interval.  The light was only observed just a few degrees above the horizon between a building and a tree when the light flew out of sight. The light was plain white of only moderate intensity but was not accompanied by any other light.  What made the light striking was the rapidity with which it seemed to traverse the sky the next time it cycled four flashes.  Only three cycles were observed. It should be noted that there was intense electrical storm activity well to the west and south of the sighting.;37.0528517241379;-88.6355206896553
Light disc’s;2020-08-08 12:50:00;2 minutes;Light disc’s In bright sunlit day I initially saw a bright disc of 2 lights side by side horizontally about 4 inches across. I closed each eye one eye at a time to be sure it wasn’t a reflection or a prismatic light. The lights moved around into the trees, a few feet above the ground and then onto the side of my house in front of the siding then a third light disc appeared with the other two.  They moved to be beside me about six feet from my face then moved in front of me and slowly floated up then stood still with an almost vibrating look to them and suddenly ascended up extremely fast then disappeared. I noticed no birds singing or animal noises during this time as well, as I am an avid bird watcher.  I looked around and away from these foreign light discs and they stayed in place and moved when they decided to move. Never seen anything like this before.;37.0528517241379;-88.6355206896553

Not sure how to relate how big it was. 20x bigger than a star?  Thought maybe they were helicopters.  Then one drifted to the right and dimmed and disappeared.  The other kept going towards us, got a little bigger, then dimmed and disappeared.  I've never seen anything like that.  I consider it my first UFO sighting.;37.0528517241379;-88.6355206896553
