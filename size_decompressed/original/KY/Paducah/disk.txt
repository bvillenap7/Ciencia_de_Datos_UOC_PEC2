Saucer Craft with much light and no sound.;2008-03-13 00:00:00;1 min;Saucer Craft with much light and no sound. I was asleep on my dad’s couch in his room.  I remember waking up in a cold sweat from a dream that was very freighting.  The dream was of my dad’s execution in a king’s court by beheading.  I remember waking up afraid that my dad was dead.  I then composed myself realizing it was a dream.  The way I got up on the couch I was sitting facing his windows.  All of a sudden I saw that the yard was illuminated with white light as if their was a emergency vehicle outside.  I then got up to look out the window and was frozen to see a saucer like craft with lights going all the way around it in a circle.  It moved very slow just above the tree tops.  I would say about 2 to 3 stories up, I could have thrown a baseball and hit it.  No sound was being made and I watch not able to move as it went down the road.  I got the feeling of needles pricking my skin all over and my heart raced.  When I could no longer see the craft I started thinking that maybe I was dreaming so I pinched myself and it hurt so I concluded that I was not.  I then turned to my dad who was sleeping and tried to wake him up, being like he always was he told me to shut up and go to bed.  I couldn’t though and I laid back on his couch all night until the next morning.  Since that night my life has changed in ways that I can’t get over.  I have since developed sleep paralysis in which I tend to astral project and sometimes feel like I am being carried off.  I became a music prodigy on the guitar and piano.  I have psychic feelings.  I also use to have a reoccurring dream that I am hovering over a coffin that is violently shaking, it opens, and a grey is laying there with its arms crossed.
