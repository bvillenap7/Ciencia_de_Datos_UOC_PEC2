I have never seen a UFO previously.   As I entered the construction zone I was taken by surprise, when, at sunset, in my rear view mirror, a fireball just seemed to appear, falling very slow down through a cloud, then continuing to fall.  There seemed to be a orb, just to the left of it.   There was a almost blinding light in my rear view mirror so bright that I had to look away, I was frightened at what I was seeing, and still I was not thinking UFO.   As I exited the construction zone, just above the treeline on the southbound side was a saucer, 50 to 60 feet in diameter, rotating clockwise with multicolored lights.  Amazing!;37.2909;-85.92
