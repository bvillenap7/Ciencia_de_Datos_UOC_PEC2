The white flashing light was more brilliant than the other two lights. One of the objects seemed to be closer to me than, the object on the right. Both objects were stationary,not moving. They levitated in the South Western sky for a few hours. I watched them for 3 hours then got bored and went to bed.At one point, a third object joined the two and as suddenly as it appeared, took off to the west at an incredible speed. The reason I thought the object to be triangular was because the lights did not rotate in a circle .;37.4868;-83.2913
Saw a triangular object way high up fly back and forth, stop, then start back again multiple times.;2016-03-25 04:38:00;4 minutes;Saw a triangular object way high up fly back and forth, stop, then start back again multiple times. I went outside to lay on the pavement and look at the clouds and a figure caught my eye in the distance, it was very high up, higher than where planes or birds fly so I ruled them out.   I watched the figure for around two minutes then ran back in to grab my phone and record what I believe to be an UFO, once back outside it continued for a minute before disappearing behind my house.   Before disappearing, it would go left and right then stop for a few seconds only to start back.  Since neither birds or airplanes stop in the middle of flight, it has to be an UFO;37.4868;-83.2913
