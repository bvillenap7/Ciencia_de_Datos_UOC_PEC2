Triangular craft with no sound in Russell KY;1988-10-01 19:00:00;30 seconds;Triangular craft with no sound in Russell KY The date and time of my report is only a best guess.  My father told me after this event that it is not appropriate to talk about things like this.  My father and I walked out of the front door and turned left and walked down the front stairs. It was dark outside. I noticed or sensed something in the sky.  I turned and looked up.  From behind us I saw a very large triangular shaped craft with lights (I believe green and yellow).  It was completely silent and very low to the ground.  I told my dad to look and pointed.  He turned around and almost pushed me to the ground he was so caught off guard.  We both stopped on the way to the car and watched it hover over us.  It never made a sound.  It was moving very slowly.  I remember it seemed to defy gravity by keeping its elevation while moving so slow.  I had never seen anything in my life like it.  My father dismissed it as military for years.  Once the stealth aircraft came out he seemed to make sense of it in! that way for himself. We haven't spoke about this in decades. I was never convinced that what we saw was military.  I will never forget that moment.  I wish I was old enough to record the specific date and time along with other information about that experience.;38.5189;-82.7018
