I, my husband and my cousin were all sitting outside on our deck around 9:30pm on July 3, 2011, when I saw a bright orange ball of light move quickly across the sky.   I said to them, What the hell is that? It went behind a couple of trees and I jumped up and ran into the yard to see it better.  My husband and cousin ran with me and when we caught sight of it again it continued across the sky and then it stopped and disappeared.  At first I thought it was a meteor but when it didnâ€™t fizzle out within a couple of seconds  I knew it was something different.  It was definitely going faster than a plane.   We watched it for approximately 1.5 minutes and it just disappeared in the sky.   This is the first time we have ever seen anything like it.  If you have any clue of what it is or if there is any other witnesses in the Mt. Washington, KY, area please let me know.;38.0463;-85.5608000000001
