I was star gazing and an perculiar orb (which was as brilliant and comparably as large as the image of a star) emerged far above the southeast treetops.  I watched with confusion and speculated as to what we were viewing.  Planes frequently travel over my homestead on route to the Louisville Airport at seemingly faster speeds at much higher altitudes than what this mysterious light was.  I proceeded to view the orb's somewhat jerky scale of the sky until it was directly above my backyard.  The small light then emitted a radiant blue flash and continued across the scerney in a much more rapid manor.  I never took our sights of the propelling enigma and it never really diminished as does a meteroid.  It traveled for another mile or so and then fastly ascended into the dark obsurity.
