((name deleted)) had built a building on the fault and my lease gave me no rights to mine under a building, as we were mining in a north direction and the building was north on the fault, pulled up on a little mound of dirt that I had put a 8 in. pipe in for the discharge water from the mine, we could see the building plane as day about 70 ft. by 60 ft. by about 15 ft. tall, we were talking about mr. ((deleted)) and I would get a lawyer in the morning to have him move it, about that time we saw a light come around the building, I shut the truck off and got out to talk to mr. ((name deleted)), the light went around to the left side of the building, so we went toward the building, we were looking at the building and it went away, just like that, it was not their any more.
