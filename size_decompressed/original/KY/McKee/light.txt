Around midnight my neighbor saw a bright light on the horizon in the sky east, southeast of McKee, Ky.  This light shined brighter than a planet. He and his wife watched as it slowly rose straight up into the sky.  They said it brightened and disappeared three times before calling my girlfriend and i out to see it.  Once it reached the top of the treeline it curved off to the southeast and dimmed in brightness.  It slowly started fading away until it turned into a twinkle of rainbow colors and disappeared altogether.  The event lasted about 10 min.;37.4338;-84.0251
