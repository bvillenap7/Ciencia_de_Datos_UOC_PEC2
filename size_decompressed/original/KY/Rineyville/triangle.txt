I live on a back road so it is really dark and therefore it was very clear.It was shaped like a triangle, and had lights at every point.On the back it had a line of steady moving lights.And it kept going vertical then back to being horizontal. It was moving at a moderate speed but then it  dropped even lower then took off very quickly.And that was it, it was gone.
