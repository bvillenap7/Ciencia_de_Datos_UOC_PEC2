Hovered, moved rapidly up and down short distances, most notably and unsettlingly, it would move laterally and wobble/weave only to rapidly move back to it's original location, called neighboring farmer(s) advised to look, they advised this is what they have been seeing off and on over last 2 months.  Same erratic pattern / motion, same low position in horizon. Amazingly bright white light below tree line not typically present, triangle seems to stay oriented with this light tonight, previous witnesses reported not having ever seen ground light before (new phenomenon).  Triangle seems to turn in place (white only visible) then appears to rotate and shows red on both downward angles, point of triangle is up, base is down.;38.2968;-84.1464
