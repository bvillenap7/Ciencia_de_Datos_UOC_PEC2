3 red triangle shaped pulsating lights.;2011-03-22 20:00:00;25 minutes;3 red triangle shaped pulsating lights Three red triangular pulsating lights...huge and no noise at all.   Changed shape from triangle to frown face to lights being in a straight line going from 3 red lights to several red lights some blinking and some not.  Was looking up at sky as sun was going down.  One minute it wasn't there, then it was.  Never seen anything like it and none since.;37.5245;-84.6912000000001
