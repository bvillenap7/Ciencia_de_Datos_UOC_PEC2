My 14-year-old son and I were driving home home from a basketball game.  In a relatively sparsely populated area about 5 miles south of Stanford on US 27 we witnessed a pale green circle of lights rapidly drop from the sky and disappear behind a low cloud.

The object was in the southeastern part of the sky.;37.5245;-84.6912000000001
