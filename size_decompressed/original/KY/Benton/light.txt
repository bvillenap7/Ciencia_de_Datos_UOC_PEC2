3 white lights in a semi-circular pattern high over Western KY, moving at different speeds from S to N, then E, then N before disappear;2007-04-21 22:05:00;3-5 minutes;3 white lights in a semi-circular pattern high over Western KY, moving at different speeds from S to N, then E, then N before disappear April 21, 2007 around 10:05 PM CST  Clear, cloudless night, sparsely populated rural area however neighbor’s security lights cause some light pollution, i.e. glare but stars can still be seen plainly. I was standing outside in my front yard waiting for my dog to return from using the bathroom and looked directly overhead. Several times in the past I’ve been able to watch a satellite crossing the night sky near the same time of night. The satellite always moves across the sky in a consistent straight flight path from West to East at a speed much faster than airplanes but much slower than meteors. However when I looked up tonight the Big Dipper constellation was to my left when I noticed 3 distinct white lights of slightly dimmer brightness than the satellite (which is as bright or brighter than most stars) and even dimmer than some of the stars. The lights were in a pattern shaped loosely like this ) pointing Northward. At first they appeared to be standing still. Then as I continued to watch they began to move very, very slowly toward the North and as they moved they began to pick up speed, and then abruptly slowed again. As one staying in the same ) shaped pattern they changed direction from moving South to North to moving toward the East. They moved a short distance in an Easterly direction stopped then turned to face north again then separated until they were in a straight line then one by one they seemed to fly upward and disappear. The entire incident lasted between 3 and five minutes. The sole witness I’m a 43 year old former manager of a medical Practitioner who’s been on medical Disability since 2005. Though my illness prevents me from working it doesn’t have any adverse effects on my thinking, reasoning, nor does it interfere with my sight.;36.8806;-88.3548
Strange light in KY.;2020-02-07 05:15:00;2-3 minutes;Strange light in KY Fell asleep on the couch at 12:30AM.  Was woke by my dog barking and growling at the back door at approximately 5:15AM.  Looking outside I saw a singular dim light move slowly to the right and then to the left and it disappeared.  The light was not broken by the trees, I saw no disturbance in the snow in the woods.  From where I stood to where I saw the light there is a dramatic slope which means the light had to have been in the air.;36.8806;-88.3548
