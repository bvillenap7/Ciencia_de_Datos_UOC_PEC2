I was driving home and noticed a low flying aircraft seemingly hovering over a nearby neighborhood to the north of my location.  As I continued to drive home the craft seemed to be moving in my direction at the same low altitude that I first noticed it and at pace with my car, which was only going 40 MPH. I was driving along the river so the craft was also following the contour of the waterway.  I lost sight of the craft for a moment when I switched direction but soon saw it again when I entered my neighborhood.  It was now to the south of me and seemed to be hovering again, this time over my neighborhood.  I made it to my house and got out of the car and looked at it.  It flew directly overhead of me, probably no more than 1000 ft off the ground. It made very little noise, a slight shhhh sound could be heard right after it passed over me but not as loud as any aircraft I know of.  It seemed to have two white lights close together on the nose or front w two red bl! inking lights toward the center of the craft but on the outside, as on wings.  It also had a blue light somewhere on the body.  I can't be sure where. When it passed I noticed two very faint bluish grey lights on the rear, almost reminding me of thrusters.  I was wondering if anything like this had been reported recently by anyone in the surrounding area. I feel like I couldn't have been the only one to see it. It didn't look big enough to be a plane.  If I had to guess I might say it was the size of a minivan or mid-size SUV.;38.4125;-85.5792
