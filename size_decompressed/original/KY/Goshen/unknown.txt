Looked to be red with single white light.  Single file formation, with first three evenly spaced with one about 10 seconds behind.  Heading east away from Louisville, possibly following Ohio River.  Seemed to be higher that most helicopters and the interesting item was NO SOUND. Never believed in this stuff unless the military is at it again.
