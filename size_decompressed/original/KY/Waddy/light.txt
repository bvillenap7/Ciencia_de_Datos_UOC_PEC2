Super Fast Pin Point of Light Traverses Sky near Waddy, Kentucky;1977-07-03 11:00:00;12 minutes;Super Fast Pin Point of Light Traverses Sky near Waddy, Kentucky Object noted in sky by occupants (college students)  of van on way to a small recreational lake in Kentucky.  Van was pulled over  as a result of sighting of a pinpoint of white light moving erratically across the sky.  Occupants of van stepped out next to roadway and marveled at the speed of the  object.  It traversed the  horizon at incredible speeds.  It also descended in the sky and then shot back up again.  It appeared as a point of light very high and made no noise nor did it smoke or emit anything.  The event lasted a while (we watched for about 12 minutes) and then we left with the object still racing across the sky.  It was daylight and the object light was bright enough to be seen at high altitude.  The structure of the object could not be ascertained. Amazingly the other van riders seemed to drop the subject of the sighting within hours and it was not talked about again.  I can't be sure they even remember the sight but it is one that I will never forget. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));38.1065;-85.1298
