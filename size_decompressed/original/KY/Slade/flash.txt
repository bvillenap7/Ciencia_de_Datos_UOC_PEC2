Satellite-like object zig zags then disappears.;2015-06-07 00:30:00;2 minutes;Satellite-like object zig zags then disappears. I saw what I thought was a satellite or the ISS as it was moving very fast across the night sky.   After about 20 seconds it started going the opposite direction, then zig-zagging up and down.   After about 2 minutes of odd flight behavior the object disappeared completely. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));37.7944;-83.699
