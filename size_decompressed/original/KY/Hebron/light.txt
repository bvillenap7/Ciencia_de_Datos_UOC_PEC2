What I thought was space station overhead wobbled and accelerated straight into space. ((NUFORC Note:  Satellite?  PD));2017-06-09 22:35:00;10 seconds;What I thought was space station overhead wobbled and accelerated straight into space. I was at work taking some trash out to our dumpster.  It sits in the back lot of our shop.  After throwing my trash in the dumpster I looked up in the sky because of how clear it was outside.   Almost straight above me, I saw a bright light moving across the sky.  I thought how cool, must be international space lab.  One of my co-workers was out painting and I called him on our work radios and told him took look up to the sky.   At that point this object had traveled about an armâ€™s length across the sky.  All of a sudden this light started to wobble.   Then the light got smaller and smaller and then totally out of sight in a matter of a couple seconds.  I am thinking that when I saw it wobble it started accelerating into space.   Never seen anything like it.  I hope someone else seen it because it was amazing.;39.0788000000001;-84.7024000000001
