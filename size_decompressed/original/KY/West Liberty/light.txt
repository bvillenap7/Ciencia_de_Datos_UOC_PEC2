Two bright lights, lasted 10 seconds then disappeared.;2013-04-19 05:30:00;10 seconds;Two bright lights, lasted 10 seconds then disappeared. I was travelling North on Rt. 519, toward Morehead, approximately 4 miles from West Liberty, it was between Pleasant Run Road and the 519 Fire Station, this section of road is straight.  It was Friday 4/19 between 5:30 and 5:40 am.  There was a light rain, but I couldn’t see any stars, so I don’t think there were any breaks in the clouds.  There was no oncoming traffic. I’ve travelled this route for years at this time of day and know the reflections I see in my windows, this wasn’t a reflection. I saw 2 pinpoints of light straight ahead and up high, they were just far enough apart that you could see 2 separate lights and seemed to be just underneath the clouds.  I began slowing down, looking up at the lights and glancing back at the road several times.  In the space of 2 to 3 seconds, they faded out as if they rose into the clouds in unison.  The entire sighting lasted approximately 10 seconds. I want to add another sighting I had a few years ago to this report because it’s older.  If  the site administrators want me to make a separate report, I will. It was early January, no later than January 3rd or 4th.  Around 5:30 am. I was travelling North on Rt. 7 just outside of West Liberty, going down the hill toward where Rt. 7 turns to the right and Rt. 519 begins.  I don’t remember the sky conditions, but it wasn’t raining or snowing. My attention was drawn to my upper left field of vision to a very bright, white light, a little larger than a star.  As I was turning my head toward it, it shot straight ahead and disappeared over the horizon.  The entire sighting lasted 2 to 3 seconds.;37.9227;-83.261
