Craft trailing smoke from 2 engines.;2019-12-23 17:00:00;10 minutes;Craft trailing smoke from 2 engines. I was driving home from work on I-64 between Lexington and Winchester in the eastbound lanes.  What I saw, and recorded on my iPhone, appeared to be a twin engine aircraft that was trailing black smoke from both engines.  It appeared to be around 20,000 feet in altitude and moving in roughly the same direction I was â€“ east.  It moved slowly like an aircraft across the sky.  Obviously not a UFO, although it was too far from me to confirm any details.  I just thought someone should know about this event.  I am a private pilot and know the difference between a contrail and smoke.  This was smoke!  I have pretty good video footage.;37.9850999999999;-84.1723999999997
