UFO sighting in Winchester, KY, red craft in the sky.;2009-07-21 10:20:00;5 Minutes;UFO sighting in Winchester, KY, red craft in the sky. It was late at night and my friend and I were sitting upstairs when my Father-in-law ran upstairs and shouted that there was an UFO outside.  We ran downstairs and my Mother-in-law, Father-in-law, Sister-in-law, my friend, and I stood on the back porch as we witnessed the most incredible thing that any of us have ever seen in our lives.  In the night sky we saw a shining red craft with an almost halo shaped red pulsing light around it.  It had no directional path to it and began to move across the sky slowly and decreasing in size as if it were going up into the atmosphere.  It was completely silent outside and it was closer than a normal flying plane.  After about five minutes it was very far up in the sky and had become very small.  Eventually it went away, then it came back in to sight for a moment.  We all could not believe our eyes.   My Father-in-law is a knowledgeable ex-air force pilot and has built and flown planes for over 20 years.  He was the one who identified it in the sky.  We are all now believers.;37.9850999999999;-84.1723999999997
