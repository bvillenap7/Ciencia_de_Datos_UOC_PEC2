Pair of V-shaped lights flying fairly fast.;2015-08-24 23:00:00;10-15 seconds;Pair of V-shaped lights flying fairly fast. My father and I were leaving my grandmother's house, when I looked up and saw a v-shaped set of lights.  One set had a red light, flashing underneath it.  The UFO had no sound.  It was 11:00pm so I couldn't see the object to make out its shape.  One set of lights were slightly lined up below the set of lights to its right.  It was moving fairly fast.   I ruled out that it could be two jets because iv never seen two jets fly perfectly next to each other or fly next to each other at all.
