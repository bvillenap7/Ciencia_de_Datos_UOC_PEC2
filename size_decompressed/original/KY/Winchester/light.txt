Objects in the sky and planes flying around them.;2008-06-06 23:00:00;2 Hours;Objects in the sky and planes flying around them. On June 6, 2008 I was walking home around 11:00pm. I noticed several airplanes flying around. Airplanes are very common in this area but what caught my attention was the number of them. You usually see only one or two but  never in the same area. What made me curious was particular groups of these aircraft with red and green flashing lights appearing to be flying in formation in groups of threes. I also noticed Several larger aircraft with the same red and green lights and two larger white lights in the back as they flew over me at very high speeds. These planes were obviously not UFO’s but while I was observing these planes I noticed a star like object hovering much lower than the other planes and traveling at a  faster speed. Occasionally the object would slow down a bit and appeared to wobble in a short circle and speed back up again. I observed this object for about ten minutes until it disappeared behind some trees. I then made several phone calls to friends in the area telling them what I saw. I proceeded to walk home when I noticed several more star like objects move higher in the sky. I then noticed one of the larger planes flying towards one of them at a high speed. The object then appeared to fly much higher in the sky until I couldn’t see it. I then saw a short white streak across the sky moving extremely fast and disappeared. I continued to observe several more of these objects and more airplanes  circling in the same area. I got home and woke up my father who came outside and witnessed the same events. I also contacted a neighbor who also witnessed several of the objects streaking across the sky. Several of my friends saw the planes flying around in the circular pattern but did not see the star like objects. Everyone who witnessed where kind of concerned and frightened at the events taking place. After a while I couldn’t see any more objects but the planes continued to circle the area. I hope that this small group of people were not the only ones to witness these events. We tried to film the objects and planes on a cell phone camera but couldn’t see them in the night sky.;37.9850999999999;-84.1723999999997
Blue/Purple light in field off Clintonville Road.;2015-11-04 22:00:00;3-4 minutes;Blue/Purple light in field off Clintonville Road. I had stepped outside to have a smoke when I noticed this blue/purple light in the distance over my neighbors barn.   I watched as it hung there for a moment then slowly started to descend, veering to the left before going out of my site.   A few minutes later, it appeared again but quickly disappeared in another direction.   I can’t confirm what I saw, maybe a drone, but needless to say it left me with a weird feeling.;37.9850999999999;-84.1723999999997
Small continuous light moving slowly across the horizon.;2020-09-17 21:28:00;2 minutes;Small continuous light moving slowly across the horizon. Came outside in my back yard and noticed a spherical light on the horizon. It floated slowly North to South following the horizon. In my opinion it was not a plane or helicopter because it had no flashing lights and moved way too slow. Then instead of moving horizontally it started to drift down past the horizon out of sight. The odd thing is I tried to record video of the object with my phone but even though I could clearly see it, it couldn't be seen through my phone camera.;37.9850999999999;-84.1723999999997
