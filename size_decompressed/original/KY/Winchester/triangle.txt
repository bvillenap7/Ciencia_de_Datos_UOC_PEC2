semi  transparent triangular sighting;2007-07-02 10:25:00;10 min;semi  transparent triangular sighting myself and two other witnesses saw a very large almost transparent object moving east outside of winchester. I would say it was a quater mile wide with the flat edge moving in a forward direction. i could see it moving, but the werid thing was i could barley see it. i was just lookin up at the stars and it was right about me. all the sides if you looked real hard resembeled like a milky way. but as it was moving i could see the stars through the lighter parts of it. so i know it wasnt a cloud(no clouds what so ever in the sky).;37.9850999999999;-84.1723999999997
