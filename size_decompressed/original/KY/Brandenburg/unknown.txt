I stead fast on birght ones, and let the clouds pass just to see if I was mistaking if they were stars they should have been in the same location shouldn`t they? they weren`t they were moving. Well If anyone reads this and can find out what was going on, I`d really like to know what phenomenon I had experienced. ty Dave ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
