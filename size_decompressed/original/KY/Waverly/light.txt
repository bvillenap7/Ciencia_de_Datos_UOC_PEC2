The object appeared in the southern sky at about 12 oclock. I was facing east.There was a tall building to my right which prevented me from seeing it until the 12 o clock position. What I saw first was a burst of light, yellow/orange in front and red in rear blending together in the middle. The object seemed to be much higher than an airplane. I thought it was a star to star to start with. The object began moving in a zig-zag pattern from south to north and at every change of direction the same burst of light would appear. what was so amazing was the speed at which it traveled, it seemed to almost jump from point to point. the object disappeared at about the 9 o clock position. Nothing that I know of can move that fast at that altitude. It was about the speed of a shooting star only much much higher.;37.7457;-87.8036
