Reflective sphere travelling West....;2011-08-08 20:00:00;8 seconds;Reflective sphere travelling West.... Sitting on the porch of my cabin talking on the phone approximately 8:00 P.M.  Facing West looking at the sunset as the sun was behind clouds making a nice view.   I spotted to my left slowly going west a shiny sphere about a tenth the size of the moon would be when it is full.  The object traveled slowly seeming to be silver and reflecting the sun.  Only seeing it for a few seconds it went behind a small cloud and I never seen it come out from behind it. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded quite sincere and credible to us.  He emphasized how bizarre, and highly reflective, the sphere was.  PD));38.3781;-82.6321
