No words to explain it or prove it,but really was something to see.;1991-08-15 20:30:00;30seconds;No words to explain it or prove it,but really was something to see. The large craft glowed orange but I believe it was the sun reflecting from a metallic craft. It was traveling from west to east. It had no navigation light,wings or vertical or horizontal stabilizers.  Ther was no visible vapor trails or engine noise. I really think it was at or near the edge of the atmosphere. The size is hard to guess at because I don't know its altitude.To give some idea of its size though  it appeared to be about the size of a C-5A aircraft viewed from about 500 yards.  The two other aircraft approached the larger craft,one from the North and the other from the South. The two smaller craft appeared only as small white lights approaching the large craft. What really attracted my attention to the small crafts was the manouver one of them made upon nearing the large craft.  The one coming from the north came to the left side of the large craft An instant before the one arrived fron the southand the light went out. The craft from the south approached the same location at very hihg speed and at the last moment stopped and circled and entered the right side of the large craft.  I hope I have given enough details.  I never reported this before because most people don't believe it or think you are crazy if you see something like this craft.
