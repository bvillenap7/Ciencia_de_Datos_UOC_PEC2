My wife and i was on the deck waiting for food delivery, when i saw a cigar shaped red and white light come from behind some houses then turned almost into a fireball with a white glow around it.  it was moving from south to north in a diagonal pattern very fast, and was ascending at same time.  it got to the left of us rapidly then slowed down and disappeared.  no sound no blinking lights, it was not a plane, a jet,nor a helicopter.  it was not fireworks nor a remote controlled flying device.  i dont know what it was.  i do not believe in alien life or flying saucers but cannot explain this.;38.2145;-85.2254
Cigar shaped fireball ascending up diagonally then disappeared.;2013-09-18 21:30:00;4 minutes;cigar shaped fireball ascending up diagonally then disappeared. my husband and i were sitting on our front porch with our dogs at 9:30 pm.  my husband told me to turn around where we both saw a shape.  it was long like a cigar or chevron.  it was not a plane.  there were no wings.  it made no noise.  it had a solid red light on it and the rest of it looked as if it were engulfed in flames. it also appeared to have a haze or aura around it.  it appeared over the front of our subdivision, it continued ascending so fast until it got over a factory next door to us, then the flame went out, it slowed down,  the red light stayed on, then it just disappeared.  this only lasted like 3-4 minutes;38.2145;-85.2254
