This was NOT a balloon floating in the sky!!!;2019-10-19 14:30:00;~5 minutes;This was NOT a balloon floating in the sky!!! I was on my way home from fishing at Tom Wallace lake in Fairdale KY. I saw a chrome (silver colored) object in the sky. I saw the reflection and thought it was a (mylar) ballon floating in the sky. As i got closer,  it got bigger & bigger. I stopped my truck in the middle of the road to try to take a picture. But i could not get my phone camera to focus on it. As i was trying to take that picture 2 jets came at a high speed and was chasing the object. When the jets went over they were so loud i could feel the vibrations in my chest and my truck was shaking. And as soon as i saw the jets the sliver object was GONE. dissapeared FAST!!!  I could not get the object to focus on my phone camera. So i went out and bought a Nikon P1000 so i can get good quality CLOSE UP pictures the next time i see one!!  I'm only reporting this sighting now because my wife just found this website today.;38.1102;-85.7595000000001
