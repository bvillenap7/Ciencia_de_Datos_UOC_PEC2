very bright white light heading from north to south;2013-10-19 20:03:00;30 seconds;very bright white light heading from north to south i went out to have a cigarette at around 20:00 and take the dog out.  i looked up in the sky at approx. 20:03 and say what i thought was a bright star or planet.  it was very bright compared to all the other stars and planets i have looked at.  then i realized that it was moving to the south i know this because i used the compass on my cell phone.  it was a bright white and then i saw what i would describe as a flash of red so i thought it was i high flying air plane, but according to flight aware app on phone there was no aircraft heading that direction near my location.  then it seemed to fade and then just disappear.   i first noticed it just to the west of the star ALTAIR in the constilation AQUILA;38.1102;-85.7595000000001
