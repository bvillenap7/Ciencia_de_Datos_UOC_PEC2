Me and my friends where driving around when I noticed a light in the sky.  At first I thought it was a street light.  But I was wrong. It started slowly moving around town then it stopped. We followed it and the light just vanished.  It was like it knew we where following it.  When it stopped the ufos turned the lights off and you could still see the shape of the UFO. We tried to follow it but it was gone.  So we drove back in town and that's when we seen two more and this time they where circling each other.  We where going to park but when we was driving both of the ufos vanished like the other one.;37.8245;-83.7811
