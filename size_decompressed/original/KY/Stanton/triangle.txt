I was on my way to work driving along the Mountain Parkway when i saw something large in the sky ahead of me.  I wouldn't have noticed it if it weren't for the lights on the front.  It was just above the trees and sat motionless.

I pressed the gas harder and quickly hurried on down the road.  I chanced a look back and was shocked to that it was gone. Where could something that big go that fast?;37.8245;-83.7811
