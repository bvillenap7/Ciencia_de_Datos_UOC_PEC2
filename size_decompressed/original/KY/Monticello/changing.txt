Two lights flying odd paterns and running into each other;2009-06-14 00:30:00;15 mins. (approx.);Two lights flying odd paterns and running into each other It was a very clear night and we were looking at the stars, there were a couple planes in the sky that we were also watching, while looking at those we noticed something that at first glance looked like a plane. After watching it for a few seconds we noticed the lights were flashing non stop instead of twice and then a pause like a jet. We also noticed it was flying at a higher rate of speed, at first it was a long ways behind what was clearly a jet but it quickly caught up and zoomed past it. It then went behind trees so we couldn't see it. We came in my house and went to look out of an upstairs window (this took approximately 5 minutes) by the time we got to the window it was all the way across the sky. It flew in a zig zag pattern for awhile and moved over to the left side of the window.  We then noticed there was another identical object on the right side of the window.  The two objects began to fly very fast toward each other, and when they got very close they turned orange and the one on the right began to get dimmer and dimmer till it disappeared.  We continued to watch the one on the left till it disappeared behind the trees. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));36.8639;-84.8229
