Triangular/chevron small object with fixed lights at corner--very fast moving.;1994-10-12 15:00:00;1-2 minutes;Triangular/chevron small object with fixed lights at corner--very fast moving. I am reporting this 12 years later, so some of the details I won't remember.  I was driving home after school, and I was on a side road getting ready to turn on to a more travelled road.  As I slowed to stop before turning onto the road, I looked in my rearview mirror and saw something flying very quickly in the distance--it would have been like I was looking over my right shoulder.  At first, the sun glinting on the object made it catch my eye.  At first I thought it was a ballon and was catching the sun funny, but then it began to get closer, and I could see it was too large and moving too fast.  However, it was too small to be a plane, and too low and too fast.  The object flew over and above the trees and to the right.  By this time, I had turned onto the road, but I had slowed down to look, and two other cars had slowed also--so it wasn't just me.  I tried to make myself think it was a sophisticated R/C toy of some kind, but it was too big for that.  It was very, VERY quickly gone.  This whole incident was 1-2 minutes in length.  The object (I got a brief good look when it was overhead) was chevron/triangular shaped, with steady lights at each corner and (I think) some moving lights between the corners.  It was silent and, as I've said, small and fast.  I did tell some others, and we thought it might be an experimental military device.  I think it was too small for anyone/thing to be in it.  It is hard for me to know how high it was since it was a very clear and bright day with no clouds.  I had nothing to compare it to in the bright blue sky.
