Me and a buddy of mine saw in the sky in a distance there were a large orange ball of light, we watched it for 15 mins until a second orange ball appeared beside it and only stayed for maybe 10 seconds and disappeared, as was watching the orb we noticed that every time a plane got near the orb would go out as if you would turn off a light bulb, it did this 3 more times and as the the third plane passed the orb went small and followed the plane for a sec and then shot straight up in the sky and was never seen again.
