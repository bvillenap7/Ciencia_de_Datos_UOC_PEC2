When I looked up I saw at about 40,000- 50,000 feet directly above me a small rectangular, white object with a circular wavy- patterned air disturbance pocket around it, no following contrail.  At first it made a left 90 deg turn and then a quick right 90 deg turn to the south and then it quickly (faster than any jet or plane)sped off over the horizon.   Again at 5:20pm I heard the same humming sound at which time I called to my wife inside the house to quickly bring the binoculars.  When she came outside (within 10 sec) she also heard the hum and saw the same object in the south sky about 45 deg off the horizon.  She tried to look at the object thru the binoculars, but was unable to find it so she lowered them, located the object again a fair distance from where it was and tried again to locate it in the binoculars.  Again unsuccessful, she lowered the binoculars, located the object again at which time it sped off over the horizon.  It was a perfectly blue sky with no clouds, temp about 75 deg.
