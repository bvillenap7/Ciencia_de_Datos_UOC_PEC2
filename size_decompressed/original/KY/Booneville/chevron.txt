Entering into sight from treeline and hovering over known field  and stream of property next to my own home.   This time we could see the shape better and it was arrowhead shaped.  The point changed directions multiple times and drifted back into treeline.   Poor quality video attached.  Taped on a Samsung galaxy s3 phone.  The red orange dot can barely be seen but was very bright to naked eye. The white dot in video is a star or planet, while zooming in to focus on craft the white dot appears to move.  It is not.  This is just the result of zooming in and out to focus on orange craft. Time recorded~00:45 july 5 2014 Hand held resting on patio chair for stability;37.496;-83.6607
