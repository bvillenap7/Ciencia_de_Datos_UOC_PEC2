THE LIGHT SEEMED TO FOLLOW US, AFTER A FEW MINUTES WE REALIZED IT WAS INDEED FOLLOWING US. I TOLD MY MOM TO SPEED UP AS I WAS STARTING TO FEEL UNEASY ABOUT THIS. SHE DID SPEED UP, THE LIGHT CONTINUED TO BE ABOVE US EVEN THOUGH WE'D TURNED OFF THE INTERSTATE AND WERE NOW ON US 32. WE LIVED JUST OUTSIDE THE SMALL COMMUNITY OF SADIEVILLE, WE WENT HOME. MY DAD AND BROTHER WERE HOME AND WITNESSED THE FOLLOWING EVENTS: MORE LIGHTS JOINED THE SINGLE LIGHT IN THE SKY, BUT IT WAS AMAZING - THE SPEED WITH WHICH THE LIGHTS TRAVELED. THE LIGHTS MOVED ABOUT THE SKY - NOISELESS, IN A MANNER UNCOMMON TO ANY AIRCRAFT ANY OF US HAD SEEN, NO PLANE I'VE SEEN HAS EVER TAKEN ANY INTEREST IN HOVERING ABOVE THE SMALL TOWN OF SADIEVILLE, KY. THE EVENT LASTED ABOUT 20 MINUTES AFTER OUR ARRIVAL HOME. I TRIED TO CALL THE AIRFORCE AT WRIGHT PATTERSON BUT WAS UNABLE TO FIND A WORKING NUMBER. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
