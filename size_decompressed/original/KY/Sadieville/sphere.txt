Two orbs seen over Sadieville, Ky.;2009-07-24 23:30:00;1 minute;Two orbs seen over Sadieville, Ky. I was lying in the back yard enjoying the stars after the sky had cleared following a day of stormy weather.  Suddenly a bluish white orb appeared out of the darkness.  The orb was approximately 5 times larger than any of the stars in the sky, and about the same color.  It moved very quickly and smoothly. I could not hear any jets or engines.  The craft was completely silent. As it cruised across the middle of the sky, I notice that above and to the object's left was another orb.  This one was a faint reddish color, and it followed the same path, running parallel to the whitish orb.  After about 30seconds both orbs vanished into thin air.  I was quite excited to see these objects, if not slightly disappointed that I had no one there corroborate the events.;38.3926;-84.5382
