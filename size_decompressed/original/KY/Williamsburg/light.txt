PD));2017-12-02 22:00:00;30 minutes;Me and my wife spotted it while looking SSE about mid sky.  It emitted green, red, blue, white, lights.  The object appeared to be moving up and down and at one point it went completely out for around 15 seconds.  We drove down the road a bit from our house so that we could get a clear view since we live in the mountains and it still appeared to be moving up and down and the colors had changed to just green, and red.   Within minutes of the spotting the object, an emense fog covered our fields and roadways.  Just thought it was all kinda odd!!
