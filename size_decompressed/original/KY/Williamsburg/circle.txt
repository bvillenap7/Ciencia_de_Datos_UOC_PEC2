Early this morning I heard a loud oscillating sound that kept getting louder until it sounded like it was right outside of my bedroom window. It woke me up from my sleep. When I went to look outside my window all I saw was a mark on the grass in the shape of a circle about 76 inches in diameter connected with a straight line on one side. The circle was not complete. The grass around the circle is green. The grass that makes up the outline of the object that landed is completely brown (killed) to the root. It doesnâ€™t look like its burnt, it looks like something pressed from up above against the grass. It is well defined. Please contact me at your convenience.;36.7445;-84.1399
