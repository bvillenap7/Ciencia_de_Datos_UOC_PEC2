Large orange ball moves and hovers above house.-January 11, 2014.;2014-01-11 20:00:00;2 minutes;Large orange ball moves and hovers above house.-January 11, 2014 I was sitting outside smoking a cigarette and I was looking at the sky, (mostly the clouds moving as it was a windy evening.)  I saw this large round orange ball and at first I thought it may be the full moon, although since the sighting, I've learned that we didn't have a full moon that night.  It was a little larger than a full moon would've been, and it was bright orange.  At first the clouds were moving in front of it, and then it started moving to my right across the sky.  Its movement was slow and steady unlike that of a shooting start or meteor.   It was much too large to be an airplane.   When it had moved to my right for some time it slowed and hovered in the sky.  Then it looked as if it rose up into the sky quickly and disappeared.  This disappearance was much quicker than the slow movement across the sky. I didn't hear any sounds during the event.;38.6658;-84.3379
