Purple orb, resembling shooting star.;2015-10-11 17:30:00;~5 seconds;Purple orb, resembling shooting star. I live on a horse farm.  As I was driving up the road to my home, I looked up and thought I was seeing a shooting star.  As I continued to watch, I realized it was moving a little slower than a regular shooting star.  It had a purple glow to it, which it was still light outside.  Suddenly, it disappeared, and I was not able to see it anymore.  I looked for it thinking it was probably a plane or something but never saw it again.  The best way to describe it was a slow moving shooting star, I suppose.;37.886681868132;-84.5667357142855
