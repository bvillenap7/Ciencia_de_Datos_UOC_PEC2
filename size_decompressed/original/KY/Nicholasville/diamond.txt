Diamond-faceted.  ((NUFORC Note:  Object was present on two sequential nights.  Possible sighting of Sirius, we suspect.  PD));2005-10-28 19:00:00;2 hours +;Diamond-faceted A friend and I were driving south on Alumni Drive in Lexington after eating out. We were returning home, which was about 1 mile past the Fayette and Jessamine County line on Tates Creek Rd. As we traveled along Alumni Dr. to my right (West) I saw a large diamond shape object above the trees. It was the size of my thumb. As Alumni meanders, it seemed to stay in a constant attitude. No movement. When we reached home, I walked to the front of the house and it was then, south, but the same size and stationery. This was about the time either Mars or Venus was supposed to be so close. My friend thought it must be that. But, what I saw did not resemble a star or planet. It was diamond-shaped with the tallest points verticle. It was very bright and clear, possibly lit from the moon's glow. This was night time. Through the center was a green belt. The entire surface was faceted, as though it was made up of millions of tiny crystals, including the belt. Since distance can fool you, I can say that it appeared to be between the earth and it's moon, however, the moon was to my north-east. I am 60 years old this spring, and even though I haven't flown since the mid 80's, I do hold a 3rd class, single engine, land rating. So, even though I have had only about 100 hours flying time, I have had some training in observation. The next night, I thought I would walk out to see if anything was there. Again, it was there, in the same position, and looking the same as before. I went back into the house and retrieved my binoculars and viewed the object through them. It was so bright, I could never get it in good focus. Since it never did anything but set there, I went back inside and forgot about it. Three or four days later, I checked again, but did not see it at all in a 360 sweep.;37.886681868132;-84.5667357142855
