A red light appeared, thought it was an aircraft coming toward us.  Noticed that the light was getting closer then appeared to stop mid air.  Lingered for a couple minutes then faded a little then zipped off quickly to the right.  A few minutes later, appeared again but closer and that's when we noticed the cigar shape.  It did the exact same thing as the first time, then zipped away to the right again.;37.886681868132;-84.5667357142855
