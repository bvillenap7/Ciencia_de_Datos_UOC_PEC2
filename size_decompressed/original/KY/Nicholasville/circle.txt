I stepped out on my back porch to smoke. I laid back on the stoop and looked up at the sky.There were birds flying around and I could see planes taking off from the airport on a normal flight path. The first object,a bright light move across the sky at a high rate of speed and what seem to be a very high altitude.I relize it to be an unusual sighting ,but was quite surprised to see it again following the same path. This continued for the next few minutes about 50 to 60 seconds apart.At one point one of the objects slowed down and met with a second object,which moved at a slower rate of speed and as they briefly met the first object resumed moving fast and the second object slowly went back from the same direction,perpendicular to the other  The balls of white lights is the first time I've seen something in the sky that I could not explain as anything other than a UFO.I've witnessed weather ballons and these did not move aimlessly as a weather ballon does.;37.886681868132;-84.5667357142855
