Saw Bright light in sky. Procceded outside to get a closer look. The two of us watched the light stay in the same position for about 15 min, then the light shifted and was now in a diffrent spot. The light was very low and close. It was a bright round shape. The object/light then started to fade away as if it were moving away but still very slow.
