Looked like a star, at first glance.  After looking for a while you could see different colors, and it looked like a beam of light came from it a time or two.   It slowly went away but was very strange.  Completely silent.  Some quick flashes, hardly noticeable.   Hopefully it's not Russia.;37.5995;-83.7179
