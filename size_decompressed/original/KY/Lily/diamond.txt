My husband and I witnessed an extremely BRIGHT diamond shaped object moving across the sky. It caught our attention because of how bright it was.  The object had no blinking lights (like an airplane) whatsoever.  It was one solid bright light (like a star) just floating thru the sky.  As it traveled east, it started to dim and eventually disappeared completely.   I have always been a skeptic but now I am confused because what I saw was not normal!
