I visited a drive-in theater with my son and girlfriend on the day on June 20, 2009.  While we were at the drive-in, we witnessed a total of 13 flying aircraft that each illuminated a very bright light and was clearly visible.  What was amazing about the 13 aircraft was they were able to connect together with each another and then they were able to completely detach themselves which occurred a number of times.   The 13 flying aircraft completely defied logic with the flight pattern they were flying on since they possessed the capability of attaching back to one another at will.  It is beyond anything I have ever witnessed in my life and for any two known aircraft to be able to fly that close to each other would have certainly resulted in a crash, let alone 13 total aircraft being able to do so.   It was truly something not of this world, or if so something that the government certainly is keeping from us.;36.7254;-86.57
