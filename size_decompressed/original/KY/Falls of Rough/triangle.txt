Two hypotenuse triangles, one directly behind and appearantly touching the one in front. Size: appeared thumb size at arms length. Color: Battleship Gray No lights or other markings moving West to East Altitude: Guessing... perhaps 8000 feet This was a broad daylight sighting. I was drawing water from an outside faucet to water plants. Looked up ans observed these two craft. Identical in size and appearance. I assumed that they were in a refueling position, with the lead craft refueling the trailing craft, until I realized that neither had any visible hose or refueling appendge showing. Speed: moving slowly across the sky. which was clear and blue. The trailing craft then began to drop back from the lead craft very slowly. The most unusual thing about this, was that they remained joined by a long cylinder which was about 1/14th the diameter of the triangles from tip to tip left to right. This cylinder was the exact same color as the triangles. The craft were separated by about 7 lengths front to back at this point. The craft made absolutely no sound. The two craft remained joined by the strange cylinder as they continued Eastward across the sky toward the Fort Knox area. With the cylinder joining these two triangles they resembeled a dragon fly. I'm guessing that they are secret military craft, using advanced design technology. I lost my notes, so I can really only guess about the date. Sorry. I am a trained observer, so you can take this information as completely credible! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));37.556;-86.4841
