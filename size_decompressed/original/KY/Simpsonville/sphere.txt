I took the picture with a cell phone camera as I was driving and I took three pictures and the octagonal object in question was in the 2nd picture I took and was not present in the 1st picture. I could not see this object with my naked eye as I tried too locate it after seeing it in my focus before I took the 2nd picture. I could only see it through the display screen of my cell phone camera. It seemed to be far away but it appeared to be a huge object somewhat octagonal in shape so that's why I chose spherical on your report site. I travel this road daily to and from work in Louisville, Ky. This is my first time experiencing something unusual like this so I thought I would share it with you. Maybe it's explainable but I cannot explain why it appeared and dissapeared so quickly in my camera view but yet I could not see it with my naked eye!;38.2351;-85.3498
