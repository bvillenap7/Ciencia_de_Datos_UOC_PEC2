Crazy.;2013-05-03 21:00:00;3 minutes;Crazy I was driving to work (grave yard shift) and I see three extremely bright lights shoot half way across sky and then they stopped. I'm know Physics Major!!  But it seems unbelievable what I was witnessing!  I have never even consider the existence of UFOs.  But what I saw that  night was undeniable!!   The speed of these things were traveling Impossible in my own mind  but yet I was seeing it.  I mean halfway across the sky and it stopped what appeared to be on a dime!  I would  not believe what i seen .   if I wouldn't saw it myself ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));38.2351;-85.3498
Strange rectangular light shines down on Backyard appears then disappears after 4 minutes and 10 seconds in Simpsonville Kentucky.;2019-05-16 23:30:00;4 minutes 10 seconds;Strange rectangular light shines down on Backyard appears then disappears after 4 minutes and 10 seconds in Simpsonville Kentucky. I have security cameras pointed to our backyard from inside my house.  I was looking at one and noticed a light that appeared to be coming from an object above and was shining on the grass. First there was one light then another seemed to turn on a second or so after the first one.  They appeared to be spot lights with a rectangular shape. The lights lasted for 4 minutes and 10 seconds and turned off as suddenly as they turned on. I looked outside while the lights were visible but could not see anything directly above from my window, but they could have been coming from something higher up in the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Video from security camera shows a patch of lawn (?) that is illuminated from above with a quadrilateral field of illumation.  Very strabge.  PD));38.2351;-85.3498
