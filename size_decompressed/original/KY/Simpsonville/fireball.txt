A few seconds passed when I started to see flames and then thought it was an airplane on fire. A few more seconds passed when I stopped my truck and got out to watch and noticed I could hear the crackling and rumbling sound of fire.  It was a HUGE meteor burning up in our atmosphere and I thought I was witnessing the end of the Earth.   I watched as parts of it broke off and fell into the tail.  As each piece joined the tail they hit the next one knocking it farther back.  I was still in amazement.   I continued to watch for about a minute as the meteor shreaked across the sky following the Earth's curvature until it was completely out of sight.   I believe it was so massive and traveling at such a high rate of speed that it's momentum let it enter the Earth's atmosphere, skip straight through and exit without ever touching down.!  I have no way of knowing how big it was for sure but visually it was about 6 inches in diameter. The fact that I could hear it meant it couldn't have been too far away. I estimate within 100 miles because it was inside our atmosphere. For something to appear visually to be six inches high at 100 miles I estimate it would have to be at least as big as the island of Cuba. I feel honored to have witnessed it.
