It was a silver cigar shaped object !!!;2019-10-05 19:00:00;15-20 seconds;It was a silver cigar shaped object !!! Sky was blue very clear no clouds. Looked out the passenger window of my truck, I saw a cigar shape.  Wasn’t sure what it was but I kept my eyes on it.  The object seemed to be right above the tree line.  There was no trail. It wasn’t a plane, there were no lights. The cigar shaped was silver.  It moved across to the western sky very,very quickly and then completely disappeared.  At that same moment I seen a Blackhawk helicopter to the east of this object.;38.6699;-85.1679
