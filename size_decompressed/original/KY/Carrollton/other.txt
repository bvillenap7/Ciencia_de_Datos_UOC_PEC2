Silver square hovering down, then back up.;2018-08-01 03:30:00;5 minutes;Silver square hovering down, then back up. Was working in the tobacco field when I looked over at another field I clearly seen this square sliver ship slowly come straight down and got pretty close to the tobacco.   The same path it came down from, it used it to go back up into the clouds.;38.6699;-85.1679
