Huge orb like object in picture not visable to naked eye.;2014-11-02 08:20:00;?;huge orb like object in picture not visable to naked eye. I was taking a picture of the fog over the water.  The sky around was clear and bright blue. Nothing but pure blue sky was visible however, when I looked at the picture there was a huge glowing bright orb like object.  My husband and I both looked and saw nothing before and after taking the shot.  Just clear blue sky.  I have no idea what this could be.;39.0385;-84.8404
