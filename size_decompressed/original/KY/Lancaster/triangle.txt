My wife and I were out on the back deck star gazing when we saw an unkown craft fly over the house. It was a dark triangular shape that mdae no sound flying low,approximately 500 feet. The craftt had very dim lights almost like blacklights. The bottom of the craft seemed to reflect the night sky. It looked as if the night sky were moving but not blanked out by the craft body.;37.6584;-84.6014

My family and I were sitting in our front yard watching the fireworks at the Herrington Lake Marina to the right, and as one of the fireworks went off we noticed a glowing object in the sky to our left.  Even though it was dark at this point, it did not appear to be very high in the sky so at first we assumed it must be a large piece of flaming debris from one of the fireworks however, the debris did not lose altitude and float to the ground.  It appeared to be on fire and it also traveled on a straight, unwaivering path, which continued to fly at the same altitude until we could no longer see the object.  While the object could have possibly be triangular in shape it was hard to see because it was so illuminated although it did appear to have flames coming from the back of the object.  It did not appear to be traveling at a great rate of speed.  There was only one object and the color was kind of a bright yellow orange like fire.;37.6584;-84.6014
