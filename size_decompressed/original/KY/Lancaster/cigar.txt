It was reflecting the sun, but from what I could perceive, it was silvery metallic. It was not moving. I was driving, so I had to keep an eye on the road. When I turned to the road and back to the object again it was gone. Like the other guy said, it was out of sight way to quick to be any conventional aircraft.;37.6584;-84.6014
