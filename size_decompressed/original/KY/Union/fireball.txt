In the northeast sky from our vantage point looking at about a 50-60 degree angle up we witnessed a fireball entering our atmosphere at a fast rate of speed.It was an amber/orange color and had a contrail that was a whitish color.  What happened next was amazing!   The ball of light,as it was descending, split into two balls of light and then three.  The objects slowed down as they got closer to the ground,then stopped!  They completely disappeared for about three seconds and then reappeared in the same location.   The objects were about the size of large jets to comparison,as CVG airport is a few miles away and we are familiar with their size in the nite sky.  The 3 objects then began to move up,down,left,right just hovering maybe at an altitude of a mile or so off the ground.  We watched them for about 5 minutes make these strange movements in a fairly close proximity to each other, and then they slowly drifted to the east or northeast and went out of our view.;38.9411;-84.7185
