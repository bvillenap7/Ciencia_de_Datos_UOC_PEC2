Large ship and several escorts seen over Melber, KY.;2013-10-09 01:00:00;3 hours;Large ship and several escorts seen over Melber, KY It was a cloudless night, I was camping at my friend's house.  We were all in a mesh tent so we could see clearly through it. at about 12:45 in the morning everyone had fallen asleep I was still awake at the time because i kept hearing strange noises.  I finally decide to roll over and look up through the tent and I saw a large object directly above us It was emitting a slight shrieking sound and it had blue lights arranged to look like a X, it also had a blue haze around it.  At first i thought it was a meteor, but after watching it for about five minutes it had not moved, in fact it was rotating slowly. after about twenty more minutes some smaller objects appeared to have come out of the larger craft and joined into a delta formation there were about four objects on each side of the formation.  They wee circling the larger craft as if they were protecting or escorting it.I would have woken up the others but I was too shocked to move.  There were some dogs outsi! de with us, they were howling frequently, there was also a donkey in a nearby field giving out loud yelps.  The objects could not have been more than 1000 feet above me they sat there as if studying the landscape.  These craft sat in the sky for hours until i finally decided to try and sleep. the next morning the dogs that had been out with us were visibly shaken.  I have mostly kept this to my-self and told only the friend hosting the party i was at and select family members. I had no way to photograph these ships.  There were airplanes in the area but i don't know if they spotted it.;36.9174;-88.756
