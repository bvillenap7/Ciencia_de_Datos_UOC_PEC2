On 8/4/06, at approximately 11:28 P.M., myself, wife, and step-daughter observed two lights of the same magnitude traveling due south.  We observerd the lights for approximately 3 to 5 minutes.  The object/objects appeared to be of high altitude, emitted no sound, and were approximately the same light magnitude of Denebe, or Vega which were nearby.  Myself thought it to be two seperate objects in formation.  The other two witnesses thought it to be one object with smaller, dimmer lights running in a line between the two main lights.  We observed the object/objects until they either disapeared into some cirrus clouds or dimmed out.;37.2963076923077;-83.1913230769231
