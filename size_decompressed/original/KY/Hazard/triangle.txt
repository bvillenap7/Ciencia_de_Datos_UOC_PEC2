triangle shaped object;1986-08-01 21:50:00;3-5 minutes;About 1986, sometime during warmer weather, just about first dark.  I observed a spotlight shining around from an object in the sky and it seemed for a moment it spotlighted me, at least the light seemed to be beaming in my eyes briefly.  It seemed to be fairly close maybe Â½ to 1 mile away.  It had just come over a mountaintop at not too great a distance.  At first I thought it must be a helicopter and judged its size to be about the size of a very large helicopter but I noticed it made no noise.  At this point all I could see was the spotlight.  I thought it was unusual and ran to get my wife to look at it.  I also got my father-in-law to come out in the street.  By the time I had gathered everyone else outside to see it, probably about 2 minutes, it seemed to have gained altitude significantly and got significantly farther away up in the sky.  It appeared to be a black elongated isosceles triangle shaped object with lights on the three tips of the triangle, large, but I could not judge its size well as I had no reference points in the sky and could not judge well how high in the sky, however, it was directly overhead.  My wife said she remembered it hovered briefly.  My wife remembers it being fairly low.  It slowly and silently glided over and past the next mountain on the horizon.  Mountains are fairly close together where the sighting was.  I'm guessing entire sighting to have lasted 3-4 minutes.;37.2963076923077;-83.1913230769231
two triangle shapes with white lights and one red flashing light. they flew at low speeds and altitudes with almost no noise;2007-11-01 21:00:00;7-10 min;two triangle shapes with white lights and one red flashing light. they flew at low speeds and altitudes with almost no noise I saw two triangular air vehicles with four white lights at adjacent corners and one flashing red light.  There was a similiar aircraft flying behind and to the right of the leading aircraft.  They were making almost no noise except for a faint rumble and they were also moving slow, almost cruising.  We continued to watch them fly toward the horizon and then the trailing craft broke off the same path and turned around almost the same direction it came from but climbing higher in the sky.  We continued to watch both aircraft until they both disappeared or until we couldn't see them anymore.;37.2963076923077;-83.1913230769231
