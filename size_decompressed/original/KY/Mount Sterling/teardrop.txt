Lager ship was about 2 miles long Me and my wife were outside at 2:00pm and saw 2 ships.  One small ship and one very large ship.  It came right over the trees with NO sounds at all.   Both were traveling at speeds we have never see a flying aircraft fly at.  The first ship seemed to be trying to get away from the lager ship.   About 10 seconds in the larger ship lite up a very bright orange and seemed to shot out 3 laser beams or fire balls at the first ship.  The first ship avoid them and seemed to go faster the it was traveling before.  After about other 10 to 15 seconds and more good flying the smaller ship went right up and the lager one follow it.  No sound at all the hole time.   I would say that the lager ship was about 2 miles long and a teardrop shape.  Please let me know if any one else saw this.
