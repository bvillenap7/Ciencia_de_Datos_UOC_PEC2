Illuminated object shaped like a bus hovering silently above a communications tower;2007-09-20 02:00:00;2 minutes;Illuminated object shaped like a bus hovering silently above a communications tower On Thursday, September 20, 2007 at approximately 2:00 AM, my son and three friends were pulling out of our driveway when they spotted an illuminated object “shaped like a greyhound bus” hovering above a communications tower that is located on our farm.  They proclaimed the most astonishing thing was the silence and stillness of this object. They did not describe any particular lights, only that the whole object was illuminated, glowing a kind of orange. As the object moved from above the tower it traveled northeast and left what they described as a “jet stream”. They did not hear any engine sounds. After it left their sight my son said our cattle started “going wild” and as the object moved toward the northeast coyotes began shrieking. My son immediately called his sister who has always believed in extraterre..strial life. My son and his friends are not imaginative or overly dramatic. They wanted to report this sighting immediately but did not know to whom. They were most amazed by the silence and the stillness of the large object.
