A town left in Aweh.;1973-06-17 17:30:00;20 minutes;A town left in Aweh I know that this is a late time to write this report.  But I know that the event that took place was witnessed by my stepfather ((name 1 deleted)), my half-brother, ((name 2 deleted)), and myself, ((name 3 deleted)).   After talking to my step father a few yrs. ago we talked about the UFO that we saw in Kentucky,  It was in the month of June 1973, we were driving to a friendâ€™s house at around 5pm.  My mother and sister was there and we were going there to pick them up.   As we were driving we saw a large ship overhead, and it hovered over us, the whole way to town. (Mount Sterling, KY), this ship was huge, all we could see is the bottom of the ship.  It was lit up with all kinds of lights, different colors.  Flickering off and on, all the lights flickered in different speeds, it was like red would flash one time, and then blue lights would flash, and as we could tell there were about 6 different colors of lights. This ship was about one hundred feet of the ground and to this day,  I cannot believe how the ship did not fall to the earth.  It was just there, over the car, moving over us as we moved in the car.  There was not beams of light, no rays or sound that we could hear. As we drove into town, we saw people all over looking up at the craft.  People were on the streets, standing alongside the road, sidewalks, by their cars.   And when we arrived at our destination, the ship stopped and after a few minutes, the craft took off.
