Triangle shaped craft, flying low;2008-08-11 00:00:00;10 min.;Triangle shaped craft, flying low This sighting took place at midnight while we were watching the meteor shower. The first thing we noticed was a really bright light moving at a distance. It soon became clear ,as the light became brighter and more clearly defined that it was coming towards us. There seemed to be what appeared to be several headlights on it, from a distance. As the craft neared us we saw that what we were seeing were very bright lights placed at each corner of a triangle. There was also a red flashing light on the middle underneath side. It was flying as low as most helicopters I have seen and going at a great speed. We could clearly see the underneath side of it, there were no markings or numbers and it was silver in color. The craft was quite large and made absolutely NO noise. It was flying with the base of the triangle going forward. The craft flew directly over us and was witnessed by four adults. I have no idea what the craft was, but I cannot explain what we saw in the sky Monday night.;38.0537999999999;-83.9386000000001
