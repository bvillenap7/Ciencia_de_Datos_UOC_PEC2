I would estimate the speed of 100 plus MPH as it was moving in a direct line, until it went out of sight.   There was a little wind that evening but the Illuminated Orb did not waver in its path.  I call my daughter who had just enough time to see it before it flew out of sight.  It appeared to be 200 to 300 feet above my house when I first saw it.  I could see nothing in the orb.  It was half the size of a full moon and illuminated as bright as it first passed overhead and, of course, appeared smaller as it zoomed away in the night sky.;38.0537999999999;-83.9386000000001
