My husband and I witnessed a bright orange light in the sky which slowly disappeared.  Another one appeared in the same area and also slowly disappeared.  Three more lights appeared in the shape of a triangle, one by one they seemed to fade out.  We managed to capture the next light on film, this one split into two.  One half remained stationary while the other seemed to fall to the ground.  We witnessed two more lights after that.  The sky flashed throughout all of this and for a while after all of the lights were gone.  It looked like heat lightning.;37.824;-85.9375
