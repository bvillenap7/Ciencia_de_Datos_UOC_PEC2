4 unidentified flying objects seen by a couple.;2009-10-20 00:20:00;15 minutes;4 unidentified flying objects seen by a couple. I'm 18 years old, my boyfriend is 22. Every night we go outside to play hackey sack.  Tonight, this is what we heard & saw.  It started with a rumbling, sounded like a plane coming over our house, we live beside a military base, we looked up. An odd shaped flying object went over our heads. It was very low to the ground for any aircraft. It had 4 lights a red light in the front, green, blue, and yellow lights on the back of it in a row. WE watched it go a few blocks behind our house and stop. It hovered for quite a bit...it probably still is. While we were staring at it I took a video.  Two more flying obects came behind us. We turned around when we heard the rumbling again.  They went in opposite directions diagonally. We saw a brown object come flying below the unidentified aircraft in a shooting star-like motion and disappear.  The one to our left went a few blocks, same distance as the first, turned 90 degrees, lowered behind the treeline and hovered. We c! ould see the lights flickering through the branches. The other to our right kept going quite a distance and turned left towards the other two then disappeared. After a couple of minutes, we heard the rumbling...AGAIN. I ran to the top of the stairs on our deck and only saw what I thought was an airplane. But, as it went on...it quickly turned it's nose up to the sky and SHOT UPWARDS. This one only had a red light. Possibly the same shape.;37.824;-85.9375
