Chrome cigar shaped craft  without  wings emitting no sound or vapor trails;2005-11-11 09:00:00;one minute;Chrome cigar shaped craft  without  wings emitting no sound or vapor trails I saw a cigar shaped object mowing south south-east at a altitude of about 3 or 4 thousand ft., traveling at about 200 mph on a crystal clear morning.  We had perfectly blue skies, no clouds, and the wingless object was as if made of chrome, the morning sun reflected off it.  It made no noise, it left no vapor trails, and nothing else was noticable.  I think the object was about 100 ft. long and about 30 ft. around.  It was smooth and silent and didn`t waiver in flight.  To look at it, you could not tell the back from the front except for the directions it was heading;37.5762;-87.28
