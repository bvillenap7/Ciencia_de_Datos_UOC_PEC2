Two red lights that changed colors and began swirling around over tree tops;2007-12-15 21:30:00;3 min;Two red lights that changed colors and began swirling around over tree tops I was sitting on my porch with my wife and off to the SW I noticed two red lights side by over the tree tops. They were parallel with each other for a few seconds then began swirling around and changing colors from green to yellow ( not a bright yellow thow) then back to red. The whole incident lasted a few of minutes. They disappeared behind the tree line.;38.9345;-84.5481
bright red light with white belly;2009-06-07 21:30:00;2 minutes;bright red light with white belly Around approx 9:30 pm ES, I was putting yard tools away when I noticed a bright red light in the sky.  We see planes all of the time, so I thought that was what it was at first glance, but when I turned around, it wasn’t.  By what we could only describe as a red light, with a little white light on the bottom, was going diagonally across the sky in a north western direction (very uncommon for out weather patterns around here).  I took a picture of the light, and when we looked at it later and zoomed in, it actually looks like multiple lights in no particular pattern.  We just wanted to bring this to someone else’s attention, we thought it was awful unusual and none of the news stations caught it either.  The more I look at the picture, the more curious I am as to what we saw.  As for our UFO history, we have none.  We have seen strange things before, but never quite like this.  My husband is a firefighter and I am a stay at home mom, that does hair for friends on the side.  We have NO background as to know what this was.;38.9345;-84.5481
Strange circular light sern over norther kentucky;2013-03-08 02:20:00;~2 minutes;Strange circular light sern over norther kentucky My girlfriend and I were sitting on my porch when  I noticed a light in in the sky that caught my attention.  It pulsated a red and orange light pattern. It began to move in irregular patterns. It would hover in one position, then move to the left or right then hover again for a few seconds before moving again.  After doing that a few times the orange light completely stopped and the object was only emitting thr red light.  A few seconds later the red light  disappeared and the craft completely vanished.;38.9345;-84.5481
