stationary disk-like object seen near I-75/Independence, KY;2005-05-01 06:20:00;5 minutes;stationary disk-like object seen near I-75/Independence, KY While driving to work I noticed a metallic object hovering in the sky about 1/2 mile or less away. It was somewhat disk shaped but with a tall dome or arch on top. It was silent and totally still.  I drove towards it to see if it was a helicopter- it wasn't. It was totally silent, no lights of any kind and I was close enough to confirm that it was nothing familiar.  It flew so smooth, like glass. I watched it from a parking lot and attempted to get pictures on my cell phone, but the resolution was too poor. It started to get smaller (moving away) so I drove after it.  I pulled into another parking lot about 1/4 mile away and  watched it until it got real small (and I was going to be late to work). It was heading to the Southeast I belive and must have been going pretty fast.  The weirdest thing is that the object had at least two bent poles or arms coming off the sides like the probes on a space shuttle. As the object got farther away it appeared more round like a dark ball. I am positive of what I saw.;38.9345;-84.5481
