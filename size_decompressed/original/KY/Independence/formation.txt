Saw 3 red orbs in a triangular formation in the sky.;2015-08-01 23:00:00;1-2 minutes;Saw 3 red orbs in a triangular formation in the sky. Unfortunately, I cannot remember the exact date I witnessed the UFO's, but it was July-August 2015 around 10:30-11pm in Independence, KY, close to Mount Zion Rd.  I was getting off work and proceeding to my car, when I noticed in the sky that there were 3 red lights in the shape of a triangle.  They stayed still it seemed for a minute, or so, but then split up and became out my view.  I don't recall hearing any noise or seeing any blinking from the orbs.;38.9345;-84.5481
