I was pulling into my driveway and noticed a light in the sky out my window. I originally thought it was a glare off my window. I rolled down the window and it was still there. The silo of the barn came between myself and the light. I parked, got out, and moved to get a better look. A cloud had come in front of the object and because there was no wind it stayed there. The light faded behind the cloud and eventually disappeared.  The object never appeared to move except when it faded. That was one of very few clouds in the sky. The light was white and fairly bright. It was round in shape. It was not a plane it was too big. I would guess around a sixth of the size of the moon.  I do not believe in aliens but I have never seen anything like it. I have never drank or done drugs.  Iâ€™m reporting this in case others saw the same thing.;38.9345;-84.5481
