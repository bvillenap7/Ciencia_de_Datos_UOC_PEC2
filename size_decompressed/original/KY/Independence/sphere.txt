Saw a red/yellow luminous shape trailing slowly across the sky, fading to a dot after about 2 minutes.  No sound was heard.   Followed by an exact duplicate about 1 minute after the first one.;38.9345;-84.5481

As we stood there we both carry pistols it shot from their back yard over to my driveway in a blur when it slowed down to almost a complete stop going by in slow motion we were both speechless. We both began to draw our guns when it took off in a literal blur. It looked almost liquidish if thats a term lol. It was not even 6 feet from us and we both got warm and it was 30 degrees. We took the truck for a test drive and we seen it again. It was running parallel in the woods beside at 50 and then shot above the tree tops and in a blur it took off at an incline and went out of sight. We were both scared. We told our family about it and others had mentioned seeing things but was afraid to talk about it.;38.9345;-84.5481
