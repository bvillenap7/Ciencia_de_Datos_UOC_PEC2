Triangular object with three rectangular Ulta Violet blue lights on the bottom.;2014-05-04 20:15:00;30 seconds;Triangular object with three rectangular Ulta Violet blue lights on the bottom. I saw a object that appeared to be a shooting star.  It was falling to the ground at a high rate of speed.  Then the object appeared to be a plane about to crash.  The car in front of me came to a stop as did I.  A few seconds later the object came back into sight and begins hovering low over a subdivision.  At that time I was about 100 yards away from this triangular object.  I came to a complete stop to get a good look.  It was the size of a truck hood, white in color and had three rectangular lights on the bottom of it.  The lights were Ultra Violet blue.  Just as I was about to take a photo with my IPhone, it flew out of sight at a very high rate of speed.  The car in front of me fled before I had a chance to discuss the sighting.;37.5809;-84.8049000000001
