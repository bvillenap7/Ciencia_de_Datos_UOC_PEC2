Strange objects appearing and disappearing;2012-05-11 14:00:00;30 minutes;Strange objects appearing and disappearing My mother and father live on a hill side in eastern KY.  My mother, father, sister and I were sitting on their front porch on a very clear, sunny day.  My sister first noticed a bright light in the sky and grabbed the binoculars to look.  It was visible with the naked eye.  She said it was flat cigar shaped -disappeared in thin air. I blew it off as a balloon or plane.  The object reappeared within minutes and I was the one to witness it appearance.  I asked my sister if she saw it and within seconds of asking her it disappeared.  Few minutes later we were baffled at what it was.  At that moment my sister and I saw two objects appear. One was super bright as if the sun was reflecting off metallic. My mother saw it at that time and said it was had to be bright due to her poor vision. My father and I looked through the binoculars and could see that it was cigar/missile shaped.  My sister also described it as flat and cigar shaped, bright silver in color.  One ! light drifted off and disappeared as fast as they appaeared.  There were several jets in the sky leaving contrails.  These objects left no trail at all. Just appearing and disappearing in thin air. One did move slightly as if in flight but would disappear! Very strange, all four of us are confused at to what we saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));38.1034;-83.6296
