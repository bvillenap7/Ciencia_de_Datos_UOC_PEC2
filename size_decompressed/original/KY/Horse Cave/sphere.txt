Reddish orange sphere seen traveling from North to South in sky.;2011-07-02 19:30:00;10 seconds;Reddish orange sphere seen traveling from North to South in sky. At approximately 7:30 P.M.I was getting out of my car at my home.  I looked up to the sky toward the West when I noticed a round object the color of reddish orange with a slight glow.   This object appeared to be about the size of a dime (held out at arm's length) and was proceeding toward the South in a perfectly straight path.  It did not make any sound nor did it leave any visible trail behind it.   There was a storm building up to the Southwest with gusting winds toward the Northeast.  These gusting winds did not have any effect on this object.   It never deviated from it's straight line of flight.  I would estimate it's altitude to be approximately 2,000-2,500 feet.I watched it until it went out of sight toward the South.   I did not have a camera with me so I did not make a photographs.;37.1887;-85.8786
