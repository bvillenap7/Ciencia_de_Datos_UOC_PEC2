Crashed metal flying machine.;2002-04-21 19:00:00;2 hours;a crashed metal flying machine There is a crashed ufo in mammoth cave national park. When I was introduced to this place I was told of strange lights nightly. I was a skeptic that quickley became a beleiver. I introduced others to the perticular area of the park and thru hiking and other activities we came acrooss what we thought was a airplane but the markings are strange and un deciphrable. We have not gone public because we did not know what we was dealing with plus we use this area to farm our product. But we decided after growing season is over we are going to let the world know what we found. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.
