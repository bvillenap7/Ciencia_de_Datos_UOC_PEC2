I think it could have been what some of us hope it was Or it could have been an illusion on my part. I hope it was them up there^;2004-07-15 23:30:00;15 minutes;I think it could have been what some of us hope it was Or it could have been an illusion on my part. I hope it was them up there^ I just looked up one night and seen a Very small, Very high in the sky shape it was a lil Diamond like in appearance, and it was moving very fast for its elevation (It must have been near the higher end of the atmoshpere) and it did not have any real lights on it but a lil shine and I think a redish hint on or around it.  I really just assumed it was an air force related craft or possibly even nasa,...  Until.... it changed directions,    it was heading northwest then it Instantly headed southwest,  then south, it was very exiting when this happened because I knew ofcourse I was witnessing something special. It was like an Old computer icon/mouse arrow (whatever those are called)that was just Constantly moving in total different directions. I have witnessed this twice actually but the first was vague and I lost it soon,  the latter one was this one and it was clear. It did these weird maneuvers for about 10 to 15 minutes then it stayed on a northwest heading and it was gone after about 1 1/2 minutes. I want to believe! ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Eclipse UFO, 3,000 mph and no noise;2017-08-21 14:20:00;<1 second;Eclipse UFO, 3,000 mph and no noise I was taking video of the Sun during the eclipse that happened about a year ago.  Later that evening while I was  reviewing the video,  I was astounded to see something fly past in only 3 or 4 frames of video.  I think the video frame rate was 30 fps.  My calculations show that the object was moving at around 3,000 mph, yet no noise came from it at all.  Also, there is a cell tower about 100 feet away from where I was video taping.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081
Hot white light over Louisville.;2017-09-18 21:20:00;1 minute;Hot white light over Louisville. I went outside to smoke and caught a light pass my field of vision and then it was gone. I thought I caught it again out of my perfrial but turned and it was gone.   I turned and the light was a very bright white dipped down like it was falling, but then came back up, and then went back down over the tree line and it did not come back.   It was brighter in the middle and the shape was not totally solid.  No tracers like a meteorite and very white.   The house with no light was at my back and most lights in all the neighborhood were out or minimal.   The sky was cloudy and few visible stars.   I'm not sure what it was, but it wasn't anything I've seen before.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081
Four white very small lights (stars?) moving in sync across sky making a diamond shape on July 4th, 2018, 10pm  ((anonymous report));2018-07-04 22:00:00;<5 minutes;Four white very small lights (stars?) moving in sync across sky making a diamond shape on July 4th, 2018, around 10pm My husband and I were watching the neighbors' fireworks down the street, when we noticed what appeared like 4 stars in a diamond shape that were moving quite quickly across the sky.  We assumed the fireworks were causing the illusion, but when the fireworks stopped the stars kept moving for around 3-5 min. until out of sight.  Oddly enough, 4 planes went over us in that time period some close, some very far away an we were able to compare.   These lights were very small lights that looked like stars, and appeared very far away.  We thought maybe they were satelites, but moved a little slower than satellites I've seen.  Not sure if any sattellites move in sync?  I've never been able to see satellites in the city, but it's possible they were.  They would've been far enough apart that if it was a craft, it would have been huge. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
