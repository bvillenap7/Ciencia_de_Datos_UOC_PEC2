triangular UFO/ Missing time;1994-04-11 23:00:00;not known;triangular UFO/ Missing time I was a sophmore in highschool when my mom, dad, brother, my friend, and I were heading down south for spring break in Gulf Shore's Alabama.  We made a stop at a rest area in louisville Kentucky.  After we had all gone to the bathroom and streched for a minute we headed back to the car.  We were on the road going on to the highway from the rest area when we noticed a huge object with lights way off in the distance.  Just joking my dad said Oh it's a UFO.  Just as my dad had finished saying that the object started moving towards us at a fast rate of speed. As it approached we could tell that this object was very very huge.  It kept coming towards us untill it was literally right on top of our car.  I was so scared I clung to my friend in the back seat.  I couldn't believe what was going on.  The object that we saw hovered above our car about 3-4 stories above it.  It followed us for quite some time.  I know that what we saw was not from this earth.  We got a really close look at the thing.  The shape of it was triangular and it looked to be at least the size of a football field.  It was really big.  It also made no sound, which I thought was really strange.  It had three bright lights that were shining on our car, on on each point of the triangle.  The thing that bothers me the most about all of this is that I remember that it was hovering on top of our car one minute and then it seems like not long after that it went up slightly and then took off at an incredible rate of speed and vanished.  When we first saw the object it was around 11:00 p.m. after it left it was about 2:30.  I remember only seeing it for minutes.  what happened with that other time? Is it possible that I could have been abducted? This event has changed my life in so many ways.  I have been brought up believing that these things are make believe and that crazy people make up these stories to get attention.  I had to change many of my views and include the possibility that we may not know the full story.  I thought I would share this story in hopes that it may help other people to consider that there may be something out there.  I didn't believe or go looking for them.  It is so hard because I have only told a few select people about this.  People think you are crazy if they here this.  I could send you a drawing if you want because it is very hard to describe all the details. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.

Me and my friend were sitting on the porch, listening to the radio having a snack. When all of the sudden, bright lights from above flashed, and cought our attention. As we looked up towards the sky, we saw a triangular shape aircraft hovering over us and our porch.Then a bright light shined down on us, the heat all around us intensified, and it was very hot. Then the beam of light flickered, and the UFO took off, and in a matter of seconds, it was out of our sight.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081
triangle shape low flying with 3 while lights on each corner.  Object made no sound!;2001-11-26 23:20:00;4 min;triangle shape low flying with 3 while lights on each corner.  Object made no sound! I live in crestwood KY.  I was driving home last night from diner and driving through pewee valley at around 11:20 pm, I looked up and saw an object ahead and above me with 2 large lights on each side and some blinking lights in the middle.  As I drove on the object seemed to stand still and not move at all or very slowly.  As I continued driving I was apparently heading toward the object because it got larger.  I got to my turn at the crestwood baptist church and turned right and the object was on my left.  As I drove I continued to stare at the object trying to figure out what it was.  It was kinda high in the air but not airplane high.  More like the height of the hot air ballons which is what I thought it was at one point until I got close enough to see there was no ballon.  Then as I drove on a bit more the object began to move from my left to the right toward louisville.  I slowed down and eventually stopped in the road rolled down my window and heard absolutely nothing as I watched it fly ahead of me.  It flew slowly at first and then gradually sped up and maintained a steady speed.  It had 3 white lights that seemed to be on three corners of the object like it was triangle shaped and had some blinking lights in the middle.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081

His room overlooked the back yard (west) and my room overlooked the front yard.(east)  All of a sudden my husband runs into my room and jerks open the front door and freezes in a stance blocking the open door looking up.  By that time I have chased after him to the door and see a black triangle craft slowly clearing my roof line (I have a roof overhang) into the open part of my front yard. (1/2 acre) I could see the bottom of the  craft and saw lights at the points of the triangle but there was no sound.  Our pine trees were 29 yrs old at that time and the craft was just above them moving very very slow. I tried to get out into the front yard but my husband was rigid in the doorway and blocked me from leaving the house. We watched it moved east crossing the street over a heavily wooded 4 acres of land until we could not see it any more. My husband tells me that he could see an object moving toward our house from way off and watched it til it moved over our roof and ran for the front door.  We were so stunned by this event that all I remember was that he went back to his tv room and we never discuss this again.  I wanted to but he did not!  The sky was clear and not black like there was some moon light. We lived next to the Ford truck plant property line and thats where it had to fly next.

several lighted triangular shaped objects hovering in the sky;2009-03-30 23:25:00;5-7 minutes;several lighted triangular shaped objects hovering in the sky At about 11:25PM I was driving home from work down a main road and I noticed an object slowly going across the road in the distance. There where at least 2 extremely bright lights visible and 1 red light. The object was at least 3 miles from me down the road. I slowed down as I got closer and happened to look to the left and I saw another object not more than 40 feet from me. I could almost clearly see this object. It was shaped like a triangle with a dent in the middle, like a mouse pointer. There were a row of white lights from the tip to the end and a red light at the very end. I could tell that it was dark grey at the top and light grey on the underneath. As I slowed down to watch and to try to get a picture, the object moved behind a row of houses and some trees then it hovered over one houses roof about a foot from it. None of the houses had lights on. I turned down a side street to try to get closer and watched another object with similar bright lights fly very quickly across the sky far in the distance for about 50 seconds. I turned back down the main road from before and onto the same side street and another object was flying directly above my car. It was shaped exactly like the object from before, triangular and with a row of white lights with one red light at the end. There was no noise, as with an airplane and the object flew very quickly as I guess it realized I was there and took off to quickly for me to see or follow. I continued down the road and parked in front of my house when I saw at least 3 more objects. When I finally came inside it was about 11:40PM. After coming inside, I have seen at least 5 normal planes flying across the vicinity in the past 5 minutes.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081
Black Triangle over Louisville Ford plant.;2009-08-10 23:45:00;10-15 Seconds;Black Triangle over Louisville Ford plant. I was driving along LaGrange Road, between I-265 and the watterson, when to my left there appeared to be a triangular shaped aircraft traveling very slowly. It appeared to be moving over the Ford plant. The craft seemed to be about 300 feet off the ground, judging by the trees. It was an equilateral triangle, made up of 3 white lights with another in the center. Two other flashing lights that switched from red to white were between 2 of the points of the triangle. It appeared to be moving left to right. I was unable to judge the size because of a lack of reference points. I am an 18 year old college student, I was driving alone that night, but it is in a densely populated area.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081
2 sighting of UFO over Ford Plant in a week, Being trailed by another aircraft.;2009-08-13 23:15:00;1 Minute;2 sighting of UFO over Ford Plant in a week, Being trailed by another aircraft. This is the second UFO I have seen in a week.  It was the same type of craft as before, in the same location, with a few differences. It was between I-265 and the watterson. I was observing it from LaGrange Road, in front of the Kroger, while stopped at a light.  It was again, an equilateral triangle of white lights, surrounding a red flashing light.  There were no other visible lights. This craft was heading right to left from my perspective. It appeared to be flying higher, or farther away, probably 500-750 feet. It was hard to judge because it was night. But this time, there was another craft following it, by my estimates, way to close to be 2 planes. It was closing the entire time until the disappeared behind some trees. The following craft could easily have been a small terrestrial aircraft. There appeared to be 2 other aircraft in the sky, but at a glace, they appeared terrestrial, and my attention was on the seemingly extra-terrestrial aircraft. I am an ! 18 year old college student, with a lifelong interest in aircraft. In High School I graduated with an over 4.0 weighted GPA. I have always been extremely skeptical of UFOs, and am searching for answers.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081
Blk Triangle craft mimics aircraft in Metro louisville.;2010-07-23 23:00:00;1 minute;Blk Triangle craft mimics aircraft in Metro louisville. This is no hoax. I swear to you. For the past year I've seen odd things in a certain area in Louisville. It is craft that are mimicing normal aircraft, kinda.  It sort of looks like an airplane, but it's not.  I have lived near an airport for 16 years so I know aircraft! The lights are weird, and it makes no sound, and hovers, and goes fast real quick. I have saw it 4 times in a year. I'm going to tell you about the most important sighting. In July of 2010 at 11pm a friend and myself was driving on I-64 heading one into Louisville. Up on my left I noticed some bright lights, three or four whites & one larger red at an unusually low altitude. At first, I thought maybe it was from a tower of some kind, but it was too big and was definitely some sort of craft. It looked like plane lights kinda, but it wasn't moving at all.  It hovered at about 700 to 1100 feet. I could not see the shape because of the brightness of the object.  Then it started moving and turning/rotating, and for a moment I saw it outlined against the sky. It was a black triangle probably about 30 to 40 feet long. It hovered/turned to where the wings were facing the ground as if turning a tight turn. Then it moved out of sight VERY quickly. Probably a mile in 15 to 30 seconds!   Then it came back just as fast!  Needless to say, we were shaken as we drove out of ! view. This was right off the freeway. I have seen these lights other times as well. Something is up with this certain location. Want to see what it looks like? Look up Oxicarian Ufo on youtube.com and you will see what I saw. To the Tee!!! I researched what we saw and me & the other witness agree that that was it. And yes, this is 100% the truth!!!! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

There was no sound, and I could not make out the color due to the night sky. The sky was clear and the stars were out but these things moved very slow and was in pairs.  They were moving north toward downtown area. Several times they disappeared and then reappeared again with the same shape and lights.

Low flying, slow moving triangular shape with red pulsing lights at corners flew over Louisville, Ky.;2012-11-19 18:35:00;3-4 minutes;low flying, slow moving triangular shape with red pulsing lights at corners flew over Louisville, Ky I was in the kitchen preparing dinner when I felt the vibration and rumble of a low flying aircraft.  It was right on top of this house.  I continued cooking, but realized that it persisted and seemed to be hovering above my house.  I opened the kitchen door to the garage and could see flashes of white light in the alley coming through spaces on the overhead door.  I assumed it was our local police helicopter circling in search of a suspect.  This is not unusual.  This is a ranch style house and the path the craft was flying meant it flew slowly over the length of the house.  The rumbling lasted so long that I went to the deck in the backyard and noticed a large object which was apparently triangular in shape because there were pulsing red lights at each of its 3 corners.  I didn't have my glasses on and am near sighted, but I could determine that the object was slowly moving northward and was crossing a busy east/west street heading towards Portland. I had time to run and get my glasses.  Then I observed a car, headed eastward had pulled over and was watching this thing cross over the street.  The craft was likely following the path of the river which is to our west.  I watched in disbelief because although it was dusk, it was only dinner time and this thing flew right over a densely populated neighborhood with lots of people still out.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081

Black Triangle hanging in place over louisville street.;2013-11-30 20:57:00;2-3 minutes;Black Triangle hanging in place over louisville street I was driving down East St Catherine St, heading towards Floyd st.  As I crossed South Preston St, I happened to look to my right and saw three orb like white lights, diffuse but big, less than a two blocks away.  The night was bright enough to easily see that these lights (as big as beach balls would look sitting in a chair next to you) were steady and connected by a black triangular structure. I noticed no other lights and no noise of any kind beyond normal traffic and ground noises. I checked again to make sure I wasn't mistaking it for a plane, and there it sat, exactly the same way that bricks don't, in place in the air, maybe four to 5 stories off the ground if the surrounding buildings went up that high.  No other lights or markings or sound. It wasn't doing anything, just sitting there and not moving and not making a sound. Swung by about 6 minutes later, and it was gone.  On way home we saw some aircraft seeming to be searching the area and you could hear them miles off.. which helped confirm for me that there was no way that black triangle was a plane or a helicopter..  I would have heard it and it probably would have smacked into the buildings downtown at the height it was at. I can't say how big it was for sure, but it looked to be about 50-75 ft across.. but there was a tip of the triangle over both buildings on either side of the street, so.. it was big enough.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081

This neighborhood is in the flight path of an airport with a UPS hub where jets fly every two minutes during nightime hours no planes have gone over for about fifteen minutes.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081
Silent black triangle over Louisville, KY.;2014-07-04 21:00:00;3 minutes;Silent black triangle over Louisville KY At approximately 9:00pm we saw a red light in the sky moving from the northeast to the southwest.  When it first appeared it was low in the horizon at around 10,000 feet in altitude.   The light on the aircraft went out and we could see a triangular aircraft that was totally black with no running lights.   It was totally silent and moved out of our sight into the horizon.   This area is near the Louisville International Airport and seeing aircraft at all hours of the day is common, however this was very different because it flew across the normal flight path with no lights and no sound.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081

I saw two bright orange/red triangular objects fly through the night sky...like a plane from Bowman Field airport except coming from the opposite direction, lower, and silent.  These disappeared as a plane would then another launched with two following yet the first stopped as I walked toward it.   It was as if we were looking at each other for about 10 seconds before it left.   The other two slowed then dissolved into the sky.   Very, very strange.

Slow moving dark colored triangular object with no lights or sound moving west and low in night sky.;2017-06-26 23:45:00;30-60 seconds;Slow moving dark colored triangular object with no lights or sound moving west and low in night sky. I work as a security officer at a building in Louisville.  I was outside driving the parking lot in the patrol vehicle, when I happened to look up and spot an object, triangular in shape, but rounded at the corners, moving across the sky very slowly.  There was no noise from the object, nor any lights emitting from it.  It was 11:45pm and the sky was partly cloudy.  I could see a few small clouds in the sky near the object, and could determine that the object was not a cloud as it was moving slightly faster than the surrounding clouds.  At night in the city, clouds have an orange color at the bottoms as the street lights of the city reflect off of them.  The object however didn’t have the same coloration at the bottom.  It was of a darker grey color at the bottom, with a lighter gray color on the top.  I was viewing this object at its left side.   My patrol vehicle was facing west, and the object was moving east along with the clouds.  The object did not ! have a shiny surface from what I could see.  As far as the size of the object, it was at least the size of 5 school buses, maybe a bit larger.  It was very low in the sky and I could tell it was big.  I asked our camera operator in the dispatch office to see if they could get the object on camera, unfortunately they were not looking at the same direction as I was, and therefore I was the only witness.  The entire sighting lasted somewhere between 30 to 60 seconds.  It continued to head west until out of view.  I am still excited over this sighting even after nearly 90 minutes after the fact.   I truly hope someone else in the area saw this thing.  I have seen plenty of helicopters, planes, and satellites in the sky at night move across the sky.  This thing was none of those.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081

We were driving when we saw it, we turned around to try to film it.  This took about 2 minutes.  When we got back in the same place we originally saw it, it was completely gone.  We know we looked in the exact same spot because we could place the star it was below.  It was extremely big from top point to the base.  We could only see the lights and could not tell if they were attached to something.  But it was too perfectly shaped and precisely dimensional.  This “UFO” was observed by myself (female 57) and my daughter (19).;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081
