Siting over Loiville, Ky;2008-03-13 02:00:00;30min;Siting over Loiville, Ky On the night of the 13th of march I was driving through Kentucky.  As I approached the city I could see lights in the sky.  There were 3 lights on each object 2 white and 1 green.  There were a lot of objects in the sky.  Aprox. 20 objects.  I looked all around and they were in a grid formation in the sky. They were spaced about 3 miles from each other.  They all sat about 900ft up and didn't move.  I was in the Air Force and I've seen aircraft before.  As I drove more and more showed up. None of them moved.  As I drove further 1 object moved in formation to line up with the others.  Same light pattern as the others. It stopped and I drove out of the city. I called my wife to tell her what happened from the road. I am not crazy. I've driven truck for 5 years.  I was in the Air Force for 8 years.  Something was over Loiville, Kentucky that night.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081
Perfect formation of 4 triangular crafts sighted in PRP, Louisville, Ky seen twice in two days.;2012-12-13 01:15:00;10 minutes;Perfect formation of 4 triangular crafts sighted in PRP, Louisville, Ky seen twice in two days. Four bright lights hovered over treeline, each spaced perfect equal distance apart. The first light began to glow brighter than the three behind it.  Then the light began to move slowly towards the east.  It flew directly over our heads.  It was triangular shaped, silent and had three thrusts at the end of it.  The lights within the craft appeared to run like chaser lights on a christmas tree, however, the light on one wing blinked red and the light on the other wing blinked. Green. As the craft flew away, the second one in line began to fire up the same way, then repeated the exact same flight pattern as the first, looking and sounding the exact same. As the second one began to get further from our sight, the third and fourth repeated the pattern. Today is 12/15/12 at 1:49 am. The same formation was witnessed by my son and I, in the same location. There were only three this time.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081
Multiple Yellow/Orange Lights near college campus.;2014-04-18 00:00:00;2 minutes;Multiple Yellow/Orange Lights near college campus. Driving home from work around midnight. Pulled up to a stop light. Looked out drivers side window and saw 10-15 yellow/orangish lights in a sort of trapezoid formation over the local college campus, with one light following from behind at a distance. They moved slowly across the sky, but did not pass overhead, just stayed in the same general area for about 2 minutes. Then, one by one, they started to fade, then blinked out until they were all gone.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081
Two rotating hazy green spheres with what looked like  fire in the middle or like a jet engine burn.;2015-11-08 16:15:00;5 minutes;two rotating hazy green spheres with what looked like  fire in the middle or like a jet engine burn. At first I thought they were birds flying at High altitude until I got my binoculars.  They were rotating so that you would only see one sphere and then two and then one, etc..... from the visible eye it appeared white and moved at the pace of a satellite across the sky maybe a little slower. I am assuming 5 minutes but I wasn't timing.  The two spheres through binoculars were a round hazy green with what looked like  fire in the middle or like a jet engine burn.  It was unusual and not like the usual balloon you see sometimes and definitely not like the migrating birds I watch for.  It was different which is why I'm writing this.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081

I say they were an estimate of 50-100 of them. They were lights red orbs, circular form. Donâ€™t Know if they were aircrafts or just lights. Our location is in Louisville, KY. 589G+CX Louisville, Kentucky. We were facing south. They where traveling like in a formation. Not a straight line, but more like two staggering lines.  We saw them disappeared after passing a certain point in the sky. They were silent. No helicopter or air plane sound. My husband was able to take the very last few orbs on his cell phone camera. Afterwards, I google it and see that this has occurred in other states, like in Texas. The orbs were very much like the ones on the articles I just read over the internet. Summary description:  Red light orbs in a formation hovering in Kentucky.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081
