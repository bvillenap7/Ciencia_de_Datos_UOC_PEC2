White Object Constantly Changes then Vanishes Instantly.;1997-08-16 13:00:00;3 minutes;White Object Constantly Changes then Vanishes Instantly. This sighting happened during the summer and a few years after the passing of my father, which would put it in July or August of 1997.  I'm thinking it was August because my initial thought, when I saw this UFO, was that it must be a bundle of helium balloons that must have gotten away from someone at the Kentucky State Fair (KSF).  The KSF normally begins in mid August and last about eleven days.  The sighting happened about four miles to the east from the KSF, which would put it down wind.  I wanted to take a picture of it so I ran in our house and grabbed a 35mm disposable camera.  Fortunately, the object was still there when I got back, and I was able to get a photo of it. The object appeared to Boil in slow motion or constantly changed shape.  It continually drifted east as I watched it, and after a minute or two a jet airliner flew past and at that moment the object instantly vanished.  The closest thing I can compare it to was the Nellis AFB UFO video that's out there on YouTube.  The object seemed to be about 1,000 to 2,000 feet in altitude.   I'm starting to get older and just wanted to share this with the world.  I'm e-mailing a photo image called UFO1.jpg. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

No aircraft could have made these types movement through the air without stalling out of control and crashing to the ground.;1997-11-08 19:30:00;45mins;No aircraft could have made these types movement through the air without stalling out of control and crashing to the ground. What ever it was I've never seen any type of aircraft do these type of movements in the air like this before. I saw only 1 aircaft but the lighting configuration changed.From what I saw there were two distinct lighting configurations,and two different flight patterns as it seemed.For each different flight movement the lighting changed from circuler to a diamond shaped aircraft.I'm a ex air force aircraft mechnanic meaning I worked on F-4's and F-15's when I was in the U.S.A.F, I was in the 59th AMU ,33rd T.A.C fighter wing at Eglin,AFB,Fla.And I will add this any aircraft attemting these type of movements would've been outta control and went vertigo and stalled and fell to the ground crashed and burned no doubt about it . ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, but that is a guess.  We would welcome a more detailed description of the object.  PD));38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081
Multi-colored round ball (primarily blue and green to start). Appeared from the North East at approx 39 degrees from the horizon . The ;1999-11-16 19:04:00;8+ Seconds;Multi-colored round ball (primarily blue and green to start). Appeared from the North East at approx 39 degrees from the horizon . The object was moving unusualy slow for a meteor and was following the horizon as it went past.  As it passed at almost a due north position it began to to drop bright yellow spheres of what appeared to be debris from the mainbody.  The colors and brightness were like nothing I have ever seen. It continued on a trajectory parallel with the surface and went out of sight.  Absolutely the most outstanding light show that I have ever witnessed.  My impression was that it was space debris because of the trajectory and the speed which again was unusually slow for a meteor. Unfortunately I was 20 yards from my video camera at the moment it appeared.  Sorry I can't provide a picture.  However Whas 84 had a listner call in about 1045PM to the talk show and stated he had live video of this event as viewed from Southern Indiana and he stated that it would be on the 11pm news.Ironically just out of curiosity I did a search on compuserve for the meteor shower for this week and found your web site just earlier today, now that's good timing !!!;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081

It then went hortizontal, the whole time not leaving its place in the sky.  A couple of minutes later another light to the right (Southernly direction) of the first appeared, a small dot or orb.  It moved toward the first light, then merged, then went back to its place. The original light went to a small dot or circle.  Strangely, the event was not reported in the media, although there was a bright, clear sky since it was sunset.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081

Me and a friend were on INTERSTATE 64 at EXIT 128 and we looked up and saw a circle UFO it had red, yellow, and brown lights on the inside of the bottom, then it had on the inside of the bottom all blue and purple lights and emitted red and yellow beams. And then it changed into a triangler UFO it was all red lighted with blue lights on the corner. And then it changed back into a circle UFO. It had again on the inside of the bottom red, yellow, and brown lights. And it emitted two more circle UFOS. They all had on the inside of the bottom red and yellow lights and emitted blue and purple beams. We sat off the INTERSTATE and watched these objects as they hovered over the car. Then we saw these UFOS get lower then higher and then we lost sight of them and couldn't see them no more. This was on November 22, 2005 on a Tuesday night at 9:45 P.M. It was very clear outside we didn't hear no sound we first saw these objects as we were driving on the INTERSTATE and we got off to watch these objects.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081

Saw a craft by the moon that had many lights and changed shape in the morning sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Celestial body??  PD));2007-11-05 06:00:00;45+;Saw a craft by the moon that had many lights and changed shape in the morning sky. My mother called me outside in the backyard this morning to observe something unusal in the sky. While I was in the shower she saw a strange object near the moon in the sky, which at first looked like a star. After looking through binoculars she relaized that it wasn't a star. She saw the craft change shape from a circular one to a longer ship in length. The craft was a series of lights, so it may have been 1 craft of many just in a formation.

Black silent, fairly slow moving craft slowly passed over downtown Louisville Ky.;2008-04-25 20:30:00;30- 45 seconds;Black silent, fairly slow moving craft slowly passed over downtown Louisville Ky. Was outside w/ coworker downtown when I noticed what appeared to be a helicopter.  Was still daylight and no other objects were around it.  As object drew closer no sound was heard.  We both witnessed it.  It appeared to be near the height commercial aircraft fly, yet made no sound and had no visible markings or lights.  Flew in a direct path most airplanes take when coming and going to the airport.  It passed over a building and we lost sight of it.  It didn’t float up like a balloon, it moved across the sky in a horizontal fashion.  As it passed over it turned on its side and had an appearance similar to a stealth bomber while making a sharp turn.  However it was slow moving and had no lights or sounds associated w/ it.  It also was more akin to a boomerang and more rounded than traditional stealth aircraft.  Initially I thought it was a helicopter, as it came and passed it’s appearance was clearer.  The black slow moving triangular and rectangular w/ no lights/sounds reported by others was the closest thing to a matching description I could find.  I live near the commercial/passenger airport.  This craft was different than the ones that fly overhead almost constantly.  Not sure if it’s terrestrial or not though.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081
Bright objects and flashes over Louisville,Kentucky.;2010-05-03 21:00:00;22:00;Bright objects and flashes over Louisville,Kentucky. At aproximately 9:30 pm Est I went out on the porch to smoke a cigarette when I noticed a really extremely bright light in the sky. It was unusual in its shape and size. The light was very very bright and seemed to be unstable as if beams were shooting out from all over it. A I watched this object, just to the left of it what at first I thought was a plane flew right into it.  I looked to the right thinking it was going fly past it and it did not. That is when I jumped up and told my son something is not right with that object I think it is a UFO. As we watched it within 3-4 minutes two white bullet  shapes objects came out of it,one on the left and one on the right. I ran in and grabbed my video camera and started filming it. We watched as its movements were irratic at times and at one time before it completely disappeared it came closer and then backed away and then disappeared. Within about 5 minutes it reappeared in the same area and to the right of it a red object appeared in the sky. The red object moved faster than any jet we had ever seen. It was if it was encircling the the white object. Then all of a sudden they disappear and we see flashes of white light as if someone was taking a picture and the flash was so bright. By now our neighbors were outside watching the activity and we noticed all the planes coming into our airport were circling away and we noticed jets taking off in the direction of the ufos. All of a sudden we hear a sonic boom and we look at the traces in the sky from the jets heading in that direction. I tried to video tape the red object and the happenings afterwards but for some odd reason I could not get it to film, all I got was static across my screen as I tried to film it. Witnesses: 1. I am self employed and a paranormal investigator. 2.Truck Driver 3.Caregiver 4.Student 5.Cook;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081

Although, located in different parts of the sky, both craft seem to be fixed & hovering. Silently. One of the crafts, look to be triangular in shape, w/ a large solitary light (fixed to the bottom.)  The second craft, shapeshifted, almost immediately after i first saw it.  (It went from a large cigarshaped light, right to a ball of light) and its been pulsating in colors, wildly.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081

2 UFOs. High altitude surveillance or intelligent plasma balls?;2017-10-17 18:27:00;10 minutes;2 UFOs. High altitude surveillance or intelligent plasma balls? I noticed two small objects at a very high altitude, slightly east of where I was standing in Louisville, KY.  I was facing northeast and looking directly up while recording video on my iphone.  When the objects began moving closer overhead, they gained altitude.   I ran in to get my phone and recorded for a couple minutes, then I got binoculars and watched them remain overhead for about an additional 6-7 minutes.  Viewing with the naked eye they appear to twinkle very brightly, as though someone were reflecting the sun with a mirror much brighter than the reflection off an airplane, and not like a flashing light but more of a shaky erratic effect and far brighter.   Through the binoculars they were very different.  They didn't appear to be reflecting light, they were just a bright citrusy yellow, like a tennis ball.  They were spherical with no wings.   The reason they appeared to twinkle is because they each seemed to be made of two spheres attached to each other, but rolling around each other in a rapid undulating and random orbit with no space in between the two parts.  This effect caused them to look elongated for short moments as the two spheres that made the individual objects were sometimes next to each other instead one on top of the other.   I tried to search for other reports of similar objects, but most were at night.  Some web sites talked about plasma orbs but I am not sure because the color was consistent.  Whatever they were, they seemed to be intelligently driven, because they stayed together and once they were overhead they didn't leave, as though they were looking back! (no voice to skull technology or other communication used on me, sorry)  This is not the first time (I assume by the naked eye view) I have seen one of these.  A few months ago, also during bright daylight, I saw one while walking into a gas station.  I watched it for 3-4 minutes, twinkling brightly but not moving at all, until a cloud covered it.  The two on the recent occasion disappeared behind chemtrails that were drifting.  A cold front had just moved through and we had surprisingly clear skies (still have today).  The chemtrails have been very heavy here for months, lessening on most weekends.  I also captured an excellent shot of a sun halo, which I have seen many times in the last couple months.  If you have any information or insight, please respond.  If I'm going to keep seeing these things I'd like to understand their nature better.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081

It happened around 1:30 pm and lasted maybe a total of 1 minute all together. At first it almost looked like a black line in the sky.  It went over a tree and I caught a glimpse out of the corner of my eye.  I didn't think to much of it and just thought it was a plane, until the object did a complete turn without turning.  It turned on the dot and started going back in the other direction, coming back towards my house as a glowing ball or orb of bright whitish/yellow light.  It was moving at a steady pace.  It then went straight up into the rays of the sun and disappeared.  There was absolutely no sound whatsoever. Clearly it was not an airplane as I live close to an airport and there were 2 planes in the sky around the same time.  Since I live so close to the airport, most of the planes are taking off or landing so they are pretty close to the ground and quite distinguishable. The strangest part to me was that it was in the middle of the day and yet it was so brightly glowing. I was able to take a few photos of the object however, my cell phone camera isn't the best so it just looks like a bright light in the sky.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081
