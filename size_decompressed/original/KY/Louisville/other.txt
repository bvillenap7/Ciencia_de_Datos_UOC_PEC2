Was In Floyds knobs in New Albany, Ind....looking South-South west. I was in the passenger side of the vehicle facing above direction.  My friend was driving. Floyds Knobs provides an optimum view of the city skyline and is a favored area for such viewing.I glanced skyward and observed a streaking object rapidly advancing West to East over the city. The object was of the intensity of an atypical star. perhaps indicative of its distance. Having taken astronomy in college it was certainly NOT a comet, incoming asteroid or other debris. The object when DIRECTLY over the city released an apparent projectile.  Both objects were white in color. the secondary object streaked On an apparent trajectory towards the city itself. The object secondary object dissapeared from view when it was washed out by the city lights below. The initial primary object continued rapidly in a westerly direction eventually fading from view. I am a full time college student . My companion at he time is as well.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081
ufos watching over america??;2001-09-12 22:00:00;6-7 hours;ufos watching over america?? I was in Louisville visiting my sister we were out on the front porch having a cigarette. She pointed out a star that looked different from the rest. We watched other flashes of light move towards it and come from it. It danced around and moved up and down in a triangle patern extremly fast. we watched it till 1am. When I arrived home in Henryville, IN. It was probably around a quarter til 2. My boyfriend and I went to the state forestry down the street. We took a telescope and binoculars. There we witnessed a least seven of these objects dance around and flash lights like they were talking to each other. They seemed to stay in star formations. Anytime a plane would go over they would move towards it as if watching the plane. We saw several military planes go over us. One made no noise at all. These things had flashing lights all around them almost as if they were planes. They would get bright and then dim and occasionaly move together at same speeds and movements. They made sharp turns and triangle patterns they were definately trying to stay in formation at all times. We watched two appear out of nowhere. There was a larger ship that showed up later and they all went crazy moving and flashing. There were so many someone must have seen something. We also video taped part of the experience in Louisville.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081

It was shaped like a yellow jacket(bee) and looked like it had something like wings on both sides in the front and back. I did not see any lights on the craft and it moved pretty slow right over my head. it was very cloudy out and the craft seemed to be right under the cloud cover. it moved right over my head and past me and then looked like it rolled over several times and changed direction. I was yelling for my wife to come outside and look at it but by the time she got out on the deck all she saw was a black dot on the horizon. I have never seen anything like this before. It may have been a large baloon like the size used in a parade cuaght in the the wind but i dont know.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081
The cloud in the sky observed for aproximately 5 to 6 minutes suddenly disappeared with a minute.;2005-02-17 17:08:00;55minutes;The cloud in the sky observed for aproximately 5 to 6 minutes suddenly disappeared with a minute. I was taking my daily evening walk  in a slight Northeastward direction in the student parking lot of the Southwest campus College  at which I am a professor of ((subject deleted)). It was a clear evening with a nice blue sky. There was a breeze that was blowing out of the west. The only clouds noted where behind me a little above the south-west horizon. The sun was to the rear left of me at about approximately 7:00 of due south at an elevation of approximately 60 degrees above the horizon. The northwest and northeast sky in front of and above me was totally devoid of any clouds except for, I noticed one solid white slight puffish at the top and whispy on the bottom appearing as lopsided square shaped STATIONERY white cloud approximately the size of a piece of paper 8x11 held at arms length. It was at approximately 1:00 of due north and approimately 45 to 60 degrees overhead above the horizon. I thought this was very strange the cloud being the only cloud in this sector of the sky and stationery. It did not touch the ground. There were some students walking about the parking lot at that busied going to and leaving classes. None seeming to notice the phenomena and I didn't bother about asking them to note the cloud. I kept watching the cloud for about 5 to 6 minutes and suddenly to my astonishment the cloud began to fade going from a white to a smoky looking brown then total disapperance in less than a minute. It expanded some what in size before disapearing. A few minutes later slightly to the bottom left at slight a distance from where the cloud was a slight glimmer from what looked like a silver BB.  About 30 minutes later a manila colored helicopter with a long rounded fuselage with red and blue stripes maybe on the crew cab, appeared from the east and flew near where the cloud was but lower, then it flew west, then south, then north,  then, east in a circle several times and then flew off southward. First I thought it was a medivac copter that sometimes lands at the hospital located east of campus. Strangely a copter did land there later but it was green and had a shorter fuselage. At approximately  17:50 upon the second circumvention of my walk I noticed further north beyond where the cloud and where the silver shiny looking BB were, against the blue sky, an object appearing as a  silver slim roundish fountain pen held at double arms length was hovering about 45 degrees it apeared above the horizon. This could have been an airliner. There is an airport in that vacinity. Coincidently, in reference to the cloud I observed it seemed to have hovered over where I had read in an earlier report about an observer who said he had seen an object in a field about the size of three football field somewhere around the Palatka Road area here in Louisville. The most outstanding, astonishing and startling obsevation regarding this report though is the sudden diappearance of the cloud completely within a minute. My questions are: has anyone else ever seen an ocurrence such as this and/or is there an explanation for this strange phenmomena that I saw. Then too, every cloud we see may not be JUST an ordinary cloud. Perhaps some type of camouflaging agent for an object or objects??? Weather conditions I took later from the weather station here from off of the internet as follows : some clouds, visibilty clear, Temp 31 degrees,  Humidity 45%, Barometric Pressure 30.24 and wind speed at 20 miles per hour  Thankyou.

Saw from r/side of sky, star like object, began going across sky to left.  Behind had bluish green trail.  As I followed it, it began wobbling left to rt, then vanished!   My daughter & I were on phone talking, she said, What's that?  Simultaneously!  She said she heard noises, sounded like interference, going Yua yua..yua yua.   Soon as object disappears so did phone interference!  It was as if this star had a fuel-trail/light-trail, that stretched across entire sky.  Just before it vanished, began wobbling left to rt, as if it lost control?  Wow!!;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081
Strange straight white light with V shape turned onit's side tail with a red light seen in the same spot not moving for about a hour .;2016-11-19 17:30:00;1-2 hours;Strange straight white light with V shape turned on it's side tail with a red light seen in the same spot not moving for about a hour . For about the last week I have seen a strange light in the sky at the same time at night on every night for the past week starting back from 11/19/16 .                                                                              The strange light looks like a straight line that is a bright white light with a V shape tail at the end of it on the right side if you were looking at it from the east .                                                                                  It almost looks like and arrow , a straight line with a V shape turned on its side with the open part of the V facing away from the straight line . But doesn't have a point on the front of it unless it has a small point on the top only .                                                                                  And there is a red round light on the bottom side of the V shape tail that changes colors . All of it is a bright white color except the red light at tail section that chan! ges colors. But the red round light isn't at the end of the V shape tail . It's at the point where the bottom of the V shape starts .                                                                                It has been in the southwest area of the sky . Closer to south . At the same time at night and every night for a week at least . And it stays there in the same spot for at least a hour . But it could be more than a hour I will time it tonight if it comes back .                                                                                  It doesn't move at all it just stays in the same spot and it gives you a feeling like it is watching you . Don't know how to describe it . It just feels like it is watching you as soon as you start to look at it .                                                                                    I have showed it to a couple of people to make sure I wasn't seeing something normal in the sky . And they have all agreed with me on what it looks like and that it isn't moving .                  !  I will report back with more information tomorrow .;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081
