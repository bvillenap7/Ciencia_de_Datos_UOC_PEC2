Large dome-shape;1976-10-30 22:50:00;several mins.;Sighted at the intersection of Preston Hwy. and Gilmore Lane on the saturday before Halloween around 10:30 to 11:00pm. Large dome-shaped object with lights on the underneath side. I first sighted this object along with two other witnesses after a Halloween party on the saturday night before Halloween 1976. We saw the object over Alder Ave. moving silently and slowing east and then hovering over the intersection of Preston Hwy. and Gilmore Lane. It hovered there silently for several minutes befoe moving east again following the path of Gilmore Lane toward Poplar Level Rd. The object appeared to be 100ft-200ft in the air. It was a large dome-shaped craft with a dull metalic finish that was visible due to the ambient light. It was flat on the bottom with a large center light and smaller lights rotating around the center light. The smaller lights were moving slowly in a counter-clockwise direction. We reported it to Standiford Field (our local airport) and questioned if anyone else had reported the same. Three years later in July, 1979 I saw the same object in the same area (I lived 2 blocks form the original sighting). On this occasion I was with my neighbor and we ran to Preston Hwy. and once again it hovered for a couple of minutes before moving eastward toward Poplar Level Rd.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081

This was the same silent, metallic, dome-shaped object sighted almost 3 years earlier in the same area. On this occasion it was a warm summer night in July 1979. The sky was clear and neither the moon or stars were visible. My best friend came running into my house and was screaming and trying to drag me outside to see something. As soon as we ran out into my front yard I saw it. I yelled to her (as we ran after it!) that it was the same object I described to her 3 years ago. It was the same silent, slow-moving, metallic, dome-shaped object with a center light on the bottom and slow counter-clockwise moving smaller lights surrounding it. It once again moved off in an eastward direction along Gilmore Lane toward Poplar Level Rd.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081

It was shaped like a saucer. My mother was in the car with me and she about had a heart attack.  It had an orange/white/opaque tint to it.  I tried to follow it but it was moving so fast!

Silver saucer shaped craft moving in rapid eratic movements and 90 degree turns.;2002-09-05 17:00:00;30 secs to 1 min;Silver saucer shaped craft moving in rapid eratic movements and 90 degree turns. It was about 5PM in the evening and I was getting ready to start work when I was walking through the parking lot where the trucks were parked and something caught my eye in the sky almost directly overtop of me..It was a very nice day out,warm sunny etc.I saw this object in the sky and it was moving in very rapid,eratic movements.There were big puffy cumulonimbus clouds that day and  right at cloud level is where I saw it.The object looked like it was saucer shaped and silver or a stainless steel color.The underneath side was dark because of it's shadow and the top was gleaming due to sunlight.I watched it for about 30 seconds to a minute and it seemed strange to me that it was at such a high altitude and was moving really fast.Honestly,it looked like whomever was piloting this craft was either learning how to fly it or drunk cause it didn't have a set course.It zig-zagged across the sky in a small area back and forth,slowing down and speeding up and turning at 90 degree angles at times.Planes at this altitude appears to be moving really slow but they aren't,so this tells me that this object,even though moving in short distances,was moving extremely fast.I watched it for a short while and it disappeared into the cloud just above it.It had no lights that I was aware of,but it was daytime.

With out takeing my eyes off the object in 1 minutes time it jumped from the spot where it was sitting in the sky to a spot about 5 miles away.  This object looked like a very slinder disc and had lights that whent all the way around it and was also tilted downward. then all of a sudden it loward in the sky about 25 feet.

As we turned the saucer shaped thing disappeared. It blinked out and was gone.;2006-12-06 11:25:00;3 minutes;My husband and I were traveling north in our vehicle on Blankenbaker Pkwy.  As we were talking I observed something in the sky.  The sky was clear with very few clouds so I had an unobstructed view of it.  It was northwest in relation to where we were and approximately 1 mile in distance from us. The object was charcoal in color and motionless. I watched the saucer shaped object for about 2 minutes while we were driving.  We came to a stop at a red light so we could turn left and possibly travel closer to the object.  As we turned the saucer shaped thing disappeared.  It blinked out and was gone.  I've never seen anything like this before and can't understand how this thing could have been stationary for so long and then just disappear. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and she sounded quite serious-minded to us.  We suspect that she is a quite credible witness.  PD));38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081
Fast moving object with flashing red light near Louisville, Kentucky.;2008-10-14 22:05:00;2 minutes;Fast moving object with flashing red light near Louisville, Kentucky. A few minutes after 10 p.m. on Tuesday, October 14, 2008, I was sitting on the deck in my backyard in Louisville, Kentucky when I observed a small round object with a red flashing light and a white light which was not flashing moving from north to south across a clear sky.    The object appeared to be spinning.   I was lying on a lounge chair facing west and looking toward the sky when I first observed the object coming from the north.   The northern horizon is not visible from our house due to large trees in the neighborhood.   I observed the object first as it came into view in the sky above the trees obstructing my view of the northern horizon. I am not good at judging altitude, but I would guess that the object was at least a couple thousand feet in the air.  We live eight miles southeast of the Louisville International Airport.   The object did not come from the airport and was not going there-it was not in any kind of a holding pattern, and it was moving too fast to be a plane.   It was too high to have taken off from or to be landing at the Louisville International Airport.    I could not hear any noise from the object, but due to the constant drone of the traffic on my street and on nearby Bardstown Road, it is likely that any noise the object was making was drowned out. The sky was completely clear, and the moon was full.  Visibility of the nighttime sky is never good in my neighborhood.  We live two blocks from a major Louisville thoroughfare, Bardstown Road, and the city lights make spotting even any of the constellations difficult.  Despite the completely clear sky, few stars were visible. As I was watching the object move across the sky, my wife opened the kitchen window and asked me what I was doing.  I asked her to come outside.  She and my 15 year old daughter came out on the deck as the object was nearing the southern horizon.  They also observed the object and were unable to identify what it was. I would be interested to learn if anyone else in the Louisville area observed this object.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081
Disk shaped object sighted during Kentucky ice storm.;2009-01-15 00:00:00;30 sec.;Disk shaped object sighted during Kentucky ice storm. I spotted a craft during the recent ice storm we had.  I was out on the porch watching all the trees fall down because of the ice.  I had just finished my cig and was waiting for the tree across the street to fall and noticed this object floating across the sky.  It was in between some trees, but I watched it for about 30 seconds before it went behind the trees.  I ran in to get my boyfriend to come see it but it never came back into view.  It was silver and disked shaped.  When it was moving it kind of wobbled back and forth and you could only tell it was a saucer when it wobbled.  It wasn't moving very fast but it was nothing I have ever seen before.  I really think it had something to do with the ice storm as it was a state of emergency. ((NUFORC Note:  We have responded to the witness, requesting a date for the sighting.  PD));38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081
strange object photographed over Louisville, Kentucky October 11, 2009;2009-10-11 18:00:00;several minutes;strange object photographed over Louisville, Kentucky October 11, 2009 between 5:45 and 6:00 pm sunday october 11 I and three others witnessed an object that appeared to change shapes from a sphere to a disc shape. the object was dark in color and at one time flashed the color red. It was first seen moving from the east/south east,to the northwest before it disappeared.It then appeared again in a the southern sky and seemed to move to the west then back to the east before moving south and disappeared completely. At one time it seemed to appeared and disappeared over and over again,but one of the people with me had a very good camera and snapped several shots of the object,and after looking over the picture it was noticed that the object wasn't disappearing at all, it was moving away at super high rates of speed and then moving back towards us. would like to know who to contact with these pictures because there are some really good ones that show the actual structure of the object.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081
Brightly lit object flys slowly over treeline and vanishes;2012-05-14 00:45:00;10 minutes;Brightly lit object flys slowly over treeline and vanishes At about 24:45 I came out onto my patio, facing NW and across the street I saw a disc like object directly above the treeline.  It caught my attention because there were 3 flashing lights, 2 red on the outside and a white one in the middle.  The outer red lights were blinking as it began going to the right.  Then making no visible turn stopped and began going to the left.  The outer red lights then flickered out one a time and the white light seemed to get brighter.  At this time I could no longer make out the shape of the craft, just see the bright white light.  There was no sound. It looked like a star, very low, directly above the treeline and it moved to my left (West) very slowly across the sky.  Then it faded like it was never there.  Directly after the light faded 2 planes flew in the same direction from the same distance and I could visibly see all the lights on the planes.  They did not fade out as the previous object had.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081
Glowing orange ball traveled across the sky in Fern Creek area;2012-07-04 22:11:00;30 seconds;Glowing orange ball traveled across the sky in Fern Creek area My family and I gathered on the deck behind our house in the Fern Creek area of Louisville, Kentucky around 10 pm eastern time to watch the neighborhood fireworks being lit on 4th of July.  I, my wife, and 2 teen aged daughters were present. At 10:11 pm, a glowing orange object appeared in the northeastern sky.  The object was traveling very quickly in a southeast direction, and it disappeared in the southern sky about 30 seconds later.  The object was flying at an altitude lower than airplanes in the area travel.  The object did not make any sound.  It was evident from both the altitude of the object, the distance it traveled, its size, and the fact that it made no sound that it was not fireworks. The fireworks being lit in the neighborhood were of the consumer variety, not the kind used by professional fireworks show producers. One witness, my 19 year old daughter, described the object at a  round orange ball.   She also described it as looking like a crown.   My wife described it as glowing, and appearing to look like a hot air balloon. My 14 year old daughter described it as red, glowing, pentagon of fire. Due to the area’s proximity to the Louisville International Airport approximately 8 miles away and Bowman Field airport about 5 miles away, there is a lot of aircraft in the area at all hours of the day and night.  However, it was evident to all of us this was not a commercial or private aircraft.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081
Saucer shaped ship seen in recording of meteor over Louisville, KY.;2018-08-28 20:26:00;3 minutes;Saucer shaped ship seen in recording of meteor over Louisville, KY. The following is a testimonial of my UFO sighting that occurred in Louisville, KY on Tuesday, September 28th, 2018, between 8:26 PM and 8:30 PM (timestamp on video). I had just exited I-264E, Exit 5A towards Campground road.  While traveling on Ralph Ave, I noticed what appeared to be a meteor falling in the sky.  It was traveling at roughly the same speed as the jets that fly by.  To give perspective, if I were standing (I’m 6’1”) and reached my hand out, its tail would measure ~1.5-2” from thumb to pointer finger and it would take ~6-8 seconds to travel that same ~1.5-2”. I pulled my SUV over at the employee entrance to the Dow Chemical Plant (at 4300 Camp Ground Road) to shoot the video clip.  While recording the video, I start to receive a call (and thus stop recording), I accept the call in the car and drive off, heading south-west on Camp Ground Road.  Interestingly enough, I see what appears to be another meteor quite a distance off in the NW direction that seemed to be leaving its tail in a curve up or spiral-like formation.  I could see both simultaneously.  I did not catch this on film but wanted to bring it up regardless. When I arrived at my friend’s house, I began telling him about the meteor and was trying to describe it’s fiery tail.  I was zoomed in to the meteor when I noticed it.  A black dot blazes by the meteor at impossible speeds, in comparison to fighter jets like those that appear at Thunder Over Louisville.  Slowing the video down and panning back and forth I actually discover another UFO that crosses above the meteor a second before the other.  This was shot on an iPhone X, and you can’t really see it unless you zoom in—but it appears to be a saucer-shaped vessel. I was previously a skeptic, but since I recorded this video myself?  I’m a believer now.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081

Saucer seen by two individuals over Louisville, KY.;2020-12-11 18:00:00;3 minutes;Saucer seen by two individuals over Louisville, KY. I was driving with one passenger heading eastbound on Shelbyville Road between the Oxmoor Mall and Hurstbourne Lane. The craft was moving north-northwest from the south-southeast from a higher altitude. Initially, we both thought it was an airplane. However, it rapidly descended to around 500-600ft. We thought it must be a helicopter until we noticed there was no noise and - most obviously - it was saucer-shaped with 4-5 white lights around the circumference and one red light on top. Even then we thought maybe it was a drone of some sort however, the shape does not match and it was much too large to be any kind of civilian drone as this craft was the size of a small to mid-size plane. To my knowledge, the only drones large enough to match this description are military ones. The movement didn't match that of a drone either. This craft moved extremely smoothly - as if it were gliding. The craft hovered for a few seconds over a neighborhood in the Lyndon area,! before heading north a bit, turning back south over the mall, and then westward over the Watterson Expressway before it shot up into the clouds and disappeared.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081
