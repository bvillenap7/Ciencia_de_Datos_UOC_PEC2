It was huge and i dont remembef it leaving;1984-07-01 20:00:00;3-10 min;It was huge and i dont remembef it leaving I was about 6 yo. Didnt recall until mid 30s. All i remember is a strange feeling came over me.. Hair raising. Not a sound really but a kinda vibration. Me my brother my great grandma n great grandpa (they raised us) all idk felt it. We went out to front porch and the feeling i recall was as if time stopped. Across the street was tall trees. Right above the trees not high at all it slowly came over the treetops. So slow. It was huge like football field huge or bigger. I remember watching until the front went ovef our house i never saw the back. I dont remember it leaving. All i recall now is waking up in bed the next day. I asked my older brother if he remembered and before i could finish his eyes got big and he said yeah it was f#!$ing huge. He didnt remember it leaving either. I searched online and found one other guy that saw it. Ill tell you his name if you respond. Idk if theres a connection, but for as long as i can remember ive had a pinhole in my forhead. Idk what it is but often wonder. I saw another years later completely different though it was a round sphere like a fire burning in a glass. I remember all of this one and nothing wierd happened. It land probably 1-3 miles away watched it go down behind trees.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081
oblong shiny silver aircraft with no wings flying slowly and relativity low.;2019-09-23 19:00:00;10 seconds;oblong shiny silver aircraft with no wings flying slowly and relativity low. Oblong shape flying aircraft.  A bright silver color that was very shiny.  Clear skies.  Moving relatively slowly.  Saw it going southwest approximately 180 degrees to 210 degrees.  No sound at all could not hear the object.  It was after dinner in the evening. Looked like it was smoothly flying with no exhaust trails, even though low normal flying aircraft donâ€™t have contrails. No wings, no lights that I could see because it was very shiny.  This happened in September 2019.  The day was either the 23rd or 24th of September.  Only saw it for 10 seconds to 15 seconds because I could not see it over the tree.  2 witness.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081
