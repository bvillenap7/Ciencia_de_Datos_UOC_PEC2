My daughter was driving us to a drive-in fast food chain for dinner after we were moving her into an apartment on the east / northeast side of Louisville, Kentucky. I looked to my right from the passenger seat and viewed what i thought a balloon someone had just let loose. The sun had set and the sky was almost dark but still had a slight glow to the sky. The balloon object no lights,  was flying away from my position like a knuckle ball at about the 2:00 o'clock position, but the wind was blowing into my face from the north. Than without a noise, the balloon object went straight up about 12:00 o'clock position, dove straight down to the left, came right at us over another fast food place and grew to about 10'-14' in diameter. I told my daughter to look at the object when i pointed over the buildings horizon. She saw the tear dropped balloon looking object and within a second it darted up and out to the left and was gone in 1 sec. It shrank in size as if traveling at a very very high rate of speed. Again no noise. If it were a balloon, how could the balloon travel seem to go against the wind about 1/4 mile and hover perfectly still, move again very quickly, hover, and take off like it was shot out of cannon?  I am not a true beliver in UFO's but this was a very curious encounter, and after watching your show for the first time this past Saturday, I thought I would pass this info to you. All the best. D.T.
