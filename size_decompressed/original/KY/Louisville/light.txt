Form a triangle and then shoot off backwards. I was sitting in a parking lot, with my children, waiting for my husband to get off work. I noticed a light in the night sky that was going north at a slow speed. At almost the same time, I noticed an exact light going south. With a small airfield a few miles away, I assumed that they were light aircrafts. They were approaching each other at the same level and I began to wonder if they weren't going to come close to hitting each other.  That's when I noticed a third light of the same size, only red, coming straight down from the sky, due center of the other two.  The three of them silently continued on their courses until they were [a thumbs width] from each other. They stopped for 4-5 seconds, forming a triangle, and then simultaneously shot off backwards in the directions they had come from and disappeared in seconds.  I was speechless until I heard my 8 year old son shout,Wow! from the backseat. Did you see that?, I asked excitedly. We both enjoyed the show, that's for sure.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081
HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Pilot Sighting Of Unusual Light.;1977-10-10 22:00:00;approx: 30 seconds;Pilot Sighting Of Unusual Light. Pilot Sighting  The person who has reported this sighting to me wants to remain anonymous.  One night in 1977 on a flight to Chicago (ORD) and after passing abeam of Louisville,Ky., an extremely bright light appeared in the northeast. At first we thought it was an aircraft that had turned on a nose light, but soon realized that it was much too bright and was much more pure white than an aircraft light. It also appeared to be at a higher altitude than aircraft would normally fly.  We asked Indianapolis Center if they had traffic at our one o'clock position. Their reply was in the negative and also mentioned that they had no radar contact. Shortly thereafter, the light winked out.

I sighted a long series of lights west of Louisville Ky.;1999-11-16 18:55:00;15-20 seconds;I sighted a long series of lights west of Louisville Ky. On 11/16/99 I was driving eastbound on I-64 about 15 miles west of Louisville Ky. when I noticed a series of lights north of me. The lights where traveling from the west to the east at a slow rate of speed(it resembled a blimp landing). The lights looked like they were 1/4 to 1/2 a mile away about 30 degrees up 500 to 700 feet above ground. There was a bright light on the east side with what looked liked a long series of bright and dim lights the length of it aprx. 100 to 150 feet long. The trail lights wasn't like a trail from a comet it had distinct shape and it was not hazey like a comet trail. It was rectangular in shape long and thin band(resembled a banner on a computer). The back of the object was slightly higher than the front aprx. 30 degree angle from west to east. As the light's drifted into the tree line the lights changed to a reddish orange color than went behind the tree line. After I top the hill the lights were gone. I watched the light's for about 20 seconds. Please feel free to contact me if you need more information.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081
Very bright white light, moving at approx. mach 2 or 3, in a northerly to north easterly direction, along a perfectly straight line, ap;1999-11-16 19:00:00;7 seconds;Very bright white light, moving at approx. mach 2 or 3, in a northerly to north easterly direction, along a perfectly straight line, approximatly parallel with the horizen and also trailing a short sparkly tail with perhaps some greenish light in it.  As the light receeded, and very quickly dimmed, several individual, smaller lights became visible in the tail.  These lights were spaced (in quite significant length) out along the line of trajectory, and also disappeared very quickly.   I thought of the comet Shoemaker Levy as it broke up before it impacted Jupiter, when I saw the individual lights trailing out in what seemed like a great distance.  I cannot understand why these individual lights were not immediately visible, when I first saw the object.  They only appeared when the initial bright light had faded.  There were perhaps 3 or 4 individual lights trailing behind, with perhaps the space between the last and second last light larger than the space between the second last and third last light, etc. I was in my car travelling north along Campground Road when I saw it. Earlier this Fall I saw a very similar bright light, travelling in the about the same direction, at about the same speed which at that time, I dismissed as fire works as I only saw it for perhaps one or two seconds as it passed overhead.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081

My husband and I traveled East of Louisville, out in to the country, because we were so fascinated. It stayed stationary for about an hour and gradually faded away leaving a residual glow. It had almost a biblical parting of the heavens look. We were sure there would be some other people that saw this because it was much larger than even the moon when it first appeared.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081
SEEN NUMEROUS BALLS OF LIGHT HOVERING IN A LARGE AREA;2000-10-20 03:00:00;30 MIN;SEEN NUMEROUS BALLS OF LIGHT HOVERING IN A LARGE AREA UPON MOVING INTO OUR NEW HOME WE HAD A FLOOD IN THE BASMENT DUE TO MY CARELESSNESS.  AFTER DISCOVERING THE FLOODED BASMENT AND OUR SUMP PUMP FAILING I WENT TO WALMART AND THEN TO MEIJER TO PURCHARE A SUMP PUMP AT AROUND 2 OR 2:30 IN THE MORNING.  ON THE WAY HOME HEADING NORTH ON TAYLORSVILLE RD I NOTICED MANY LIGHTS IN THE SKY IN SUCH A NARROW SIGHT RANGE.  THERE WERE SO MANY LIGHTS IN THE SKY AROUND 15 OR SO (A GUESS).  THERE WAS 3 LIGHTS THAT CAUGHT MY ATTENTION THE MOST.  THEY WERE IN THE TOP RIGHT OF MY VIEW OF SIGHT.  THESE 3 LIGHTS WERE IN THE SHAPE OF A TRIANGLE.  I ARRIVED HOME AND ASKED MY WIFE SOON TO BE TO COME LOOK AT THESE LIGHTS.  WE COULD NOT SEE THESE LIGHTS FROM OUR HOUSE SO WE DROVE BACK OVER TAYLORSVILLE RD AND OBSERVED THESE LIGHTS. THE SAME 3 LIGHTS HAD BARELY MOVED.  SOME OF THE OTHER LIGHTS I CAN ATTRIBUTE TO MAN MADE AIRCRAFT SUCH AS HELICOPTERS HOVERING.  THESE 3 BRIGHT LIGHTS HAD OTHER LIGHTS NEAR THEM IN A PERFECT STRAIGHT LINE RUNNING RIGHT TO LEFT.  AFTER WATCHING THIS EVENT FOR SEVERAL MINUTES, WE WENT HOME AND WORKED ON THE FLOODED BASEMENT AND TURNED ON THE RADIO TO LISTEN TO SEE IF ANYTHING HAD BEEN REPORTED.  OF COURSE NOTHING WAS ON THE NEWS.  I JUST FIND IT SO HARD TO UNDERSTAND WHY SO MANY LIGHTS WAS OVER THE CITY AT THAT TIME OF NIGHT.  WE DID NOT STAY FOR THE DURATION OF THIS EVENT DUE TO THE PROBLEM AT HOME, BUT THE TOTAL TIME DURATION THAT WE WITNESSED WAS ABOUT A HALF HOUR.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081

I do kow it wasn't a metor. It was a yellowish white ball of light not fast enough for metor falling but faster than a plane. I tryed to follow it but our house is surrounded by trees and I was only able to see for 15 seconds before the trees blocked my view. I have never seen anything like this.

dancing light(s);2002-08-23 02:30:00;30 min;dancing light(s) I was just about to go to bed on Friday night, and was sitting in my bed. I had just turned off my reading light to try and force myself to go to sleep because I knew I needed to get up relatively early in the morning even though I wasn't particularly tired. I lay there in bed and happened to look out my second story window and saw a small gray object outside my window. I wasn't sure what it was so I sat up and took a closer look. As it turned out it was nothing but some piece of electrical equipment attached to an electrical wire coming from the pole. I had a good laugh at myself and was about to lay back down when a quick flash of light caught my eye. My window looks directly east.  ((NUFORC NOTE:  Should read west.  Please see note below.)) In my field of vision was a two story apartment building with parking lights pointing in my direction. Directly behind that is a 4 story hospital. Well about 1 1/2 hands high above the hospital is where I saw the light. It was a smallish light - mostly white but every once in a while I would see red glimpses. The reason it caught my eye is that it was moving at incredible speeds. So I sat there and watched it for a moment. At first I thought thought there were 2 or three lights in the sky -because it seemed like they were chasing each other. They were doing impossible loops, switchbacks and S curves. I got excited and ran downstairs to get my housemate who was still up watching TV to make sure I get someone else to see this so nobody could say I was crazy. He came up and and saw the light too. He saw them doing the loops, etc. but he is the kind of person that quickly dismisses anything outside his purview. He said: It's just a light - probably a spotlight - and left to go back downstairs. I continued to watch it. The light(s) were appearing on just past the edge of a line of clouds from a front that was passing by. The front contained the kind of clouds that look like thick fish scales - I forget their name - like a tight pattern of small cumulus clouds but not very thick. Just past the front where I was seeing the light ! there we re some high cirrus clouds that were thinning to the point that I could see a star. When I first noticed the spectacle I thought that there were 2 or maybe 3 lights up there dancing around, but the more I watched I realized that I was just watching one light - the other must have left or it was always just the one. Anyway, the light was smallish in size - about as bright as say Venus or Sirrus and about as big in size. I got the impression that the light was quite a distance away because as it was doing its loops and spirals it was reflecting its light in the thin clouds around it. With my roommates thought of a spotlight in mind I tried to discern whether this was really the case as it was staying in the general vacinity of where I was looking - namely just above the hosiptal. I quickly dismissed this idea becuase it wasn't showing any kind of pattern that I could see. At times the light was moving slowly and then it would suddenly move as fast as a shooting star. It seemed to be roughly circling something but it was just going around in cirlcles. It was doubling back on itself in extremely tight turns at very high speeds. Because there were some electrical lines in my way of sight I decided to go downstairs to see if I could get a better view. I ended up standing on the bed of my roomates truck and ended up watching the light for a total duration of about 1/2 hour - 45 min. Even though there were lights illuminating the parking lot across the street the light could still be easily seen darting in and out of clouds and doing its dance. The light was not constant in that I could always see it. For brief moments it would disappear behind the clouds or moved so fast that my eyes had to catch up with it. It watched it until another line of thick clouds obscured the light and I thought it was over so I went back to bed. Once upsatairs and in bed I took one last look outside and saw the light one last time - this time it shot straight up and that was it.  I never thought I'd be reporting a UFO though I've alw! ays want ed to see one. I'm currently an umemployed fine artist and I had just moved here less than a week ago. I like to think that I have an excellent eye for detail and have enough control over my emotions not to latch on to any one idea, having a very open mind. I was a Benedictine monk for 2 years and had just recently finished a 6 month stint infiltrating and gathering information on a racist organization. (if you could leave that part out it would be greatly appreciated). I am telling you this to let you know that although I may be eccentric and in some folks eyes considered weird - I have my head firmly planted on my shoulders. Also I was completely sober throughout the whole experience. I would like to know if anyone else in this area had seen this light. The next day I looked at a map to see what falls directly east of where I live. The Ohio river is directly east of me along with a neighborhood and right on the river I saw the Louisville/Jefferson county Riverport Authority which according to my map which was dated 1995 was still under construction. I hope any of this can be of help. I knew of you people from looking at rense.com. ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION FROM WITNESS)) dancing light(s) Hello - i filed a report earlier today about a dancing light i saw friday night here in Louisville, KY. I realized after the fact that I reported the wrong direction in which I saw the light. I saw the laght to the WEST of where I was  and NOT the EAST.

4 lights moving across the moon;2004-11-26 20:15:00;15 minutes;4 lights moving across the moon I am not sure what it was I saw. I was walking to my car on my lunch break (I work 2nd shift) and I happened to look up at the moon. The clouds were moving off the moon and I saw what looked like lights or delierately moving pieces of light that had cloud around them. At first they were coming from the dark of the sky towards the light of the moon the lights would collide and go off in 4 different directions. As I watched I noticed they weren't generated from a ground source because there was no trail to the ground. I noticed that the lights moved deliberately but not always in the same pattern sometimes three of the lights would come together and the 4th would come just after. I called back into my office and asked two friends to come down and look at this. As I waited the lights started to fade away becoming less distinct and the pattern of their movement became more erratic. My two friends arrived to see a little of what I saw. They saw that the objects didn't have a ground trail like a search light would and they saw the lights moving in patterns but as we all stood there the lights disappeared.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081
3 friends watched by a bluish light that moved with incredible speed 100 ft away.;2005-06-15 22:30:00;10 seconds;3 friends watched by a bluish light that moved with incredible speed 100 ft away. Me and two of my friends were walking down Columbia AVE. to go to an overpass around 10:30 PM to 11:00 PM and while looking at the dark pavement as we walked we noticed what we thought was a spot light coming from a police helicopter behind us. I knew from the color of the light that this was no ordinary spotlight, it was a blueish color that reminded me of the new headlights on some cars but casted no shadow. Curious as to what it was coming from we all looked back at the same time and seen a bright bluish white light hovering (no sound) above the last house on Virginia AVE. which was less than 75 yards away. Before anyone could even think of something to say the spotlight flashed toward the sky and faded out as if it knew we had spotted it but the craft remained glowing. About 2 seconds later still baffled we watched the craft dart off to the north with unbelievable speed (literally the blink of an eye) and was gone. about 2 to 3 seconds later we heard a very loud boom like thunder although there wasn't a cloud in the sky. Now I've never heard a sonic boom before but im willing to bet that is what it sounds like.  To this day my friends are reluctant to talk about this with other people for fear of ridicule, and we have no explaination as to what it was we saw that night. All I can say is there is no man made vehicle that can move like this that I know of, I have never seen anything like it before in my life and I doubt I ever will agian. I remember this like it was yesterday and it will always stay fresh in my mind. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081

At the Starbucks Coffee, 4200 Shelbyville Road, Louisville, KY, I looked up in the clear night sky and happened to see two lighted objects, each about the size of a star or planet, and one trailing the other and seperated by some distance. They were both moving in the same direction, approximately southeast. There was no sound associated with the objects. I looked closely and saw no other colored lights, such as red or green that I have seen with high flying aircraft, with the two lighted objects. The visibility of the two lighted objects faded and was lost while the objects were still high in the sky. I of course am very curious concerning what I was looking at. I am no nonsense person.

PD)) Louisville, Ky. 6 am. Two lights moving across the sky from horizon to horizon in about 2 minutes. I first noticed the light above the SW horizon. In appearance the light was similar to the appearance of Venus in the morning sky that morning both in intensity and color.  The light was moving across the sky in a northeasterly direction. About 10 seconds after I noticed the first light a second light appeared over the horizon. The second light was following the same path as the first – both in position and direction.  I watched the lights move across the sky. I didn’t have a watch, but I anticipate it took about two minutes for the lights to move from the western horizon to above the eastern horizon.  While I viewed the lights, they were consistent in speed and direction. The distance between the first and second light remained consistent – with one caveat. When I last looked at the lights, now above the eastern horizon, the second light appeared above the first light – as if it were higher.  What I did not do… I did not follow the lights until they were out of sight. When last I looked, the bottom light was 10 – 15 degrees above the eastern horizon with the second light a few degrees above the first.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081

Star like object appeared to move in circular paths;2008-11-01 21:00:00;2 hours;Star like object appeared to move in circular paths At approximately 9:00PM I noticed a star approximately 10 degrees south of vertical move in an erratic circular path about 2 degrees from its original position and return to its original position.  As it moved, the object had a sort of twinkling effect.  I observed this object over the course of 2 hours.  It would remain stationary for several minutes then it would move in the erratic circular pattern.  The objects motion over time was in a westerly direction but its progress was more rapid than the other stars.  I phoned a friend who verified what I was seeing.  He lives about 12 miles west of me and saw the object in the same relative position in the sky as me so I would say the object was at a high altitude.  My friend tried to look through his telescope at the object but could only resolve the object as a point source of light.

Bright object pulsing and dissapearing stationary in the sky;2008-11-03 18:35:00;20 mins;Bright object pulsing and dissapearing stationary in the sky On November 23rd we were driving, on seventh street in Louisville Kentucky, traveling southwest towards Berry Blvd when we noticed an object in the sky.  At first we thought it might be a bright star, but the object appeared to pulse, which was quite abnormal. Continuing to examine the object I noticed that it appeared to pulse slightly into a haze, as if the object were having some sort of lensing effect applied to it, so I rolled down the vehicle window and looked at the object in the clear, and sure enough the hazing was not an effect of the windshield or any other glass or reflection. While I was observing the object it pulsed and winked out.  I would have thought nothing more of it except that it returned about 4-seconds later.  Upon further observance as we approached berry blvd, the object again pulsed but the effect seemed longer and brighter with angular stabbing lights extending from it briefly.  I looked and noted it was not a plane, had no running lights of any kind and as I was checking to see if it was mounted on a tower, the object disappeared again.  4 seconds or thereabouts later, it re-appeared. It was certainly not the moon, it wasn’t a plane and the object didn’t move, nor was it mounted on a tower.  I’m not aware of any object that can dead hover, produce no sound, and pulse and disappear and reappear staying roughly two to three hundred feet in the sky.  I’m not sure what it was.

Noticed an unusual colored light in South West sky, bright orange light was moving slowly just above low cloud cover, slowing down and speeding up, then light moved slightly northward and became smaller, yet brighter and the bright light eventually stopped shining.  There were no noises during the event, and from my perspective, the light looked low as the current cloud elevation is 5000 to 6000 feet.  There seemed to be a very small light near the bigger light very briefly...;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081

It was night so it was very illuminated.   It hung in the sky and then it appeared to be going in a slight ascending straight line away from me at a north east direction then disappeared. It did not look like fireworks.  The location was on Robbs Lane near the Outer Loop in Louisville, KY.

I am a 21 year old male.  I do not take any medications other than lisinipril for blood pressure.  And have been declared competitent by my peers.   I was sitting outside last night, enjoying the cool night air, when a slow pulsing light caught my attention.  It wasnt blinking red or green such as a normal aircraft would be.  I see planes cross the sky every hour or more where there is an airport close to me.   But this light moved in such an erratic pattern that I have never seen any airplane or helicopter do.  Almost as if it skipped sections of the sky.  It was completely silent.  And my best explanation of the color would be almost an neon bluish purple.  It gave me the creeps.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081

It blinked 3 times then moved quickly to the left in a perfectly smooth straight line then completely disappeared.  It didn’t drop out of the sky or reappear anywhere else.   My boyfriend was driving separately and saw the exact same thing a few cars back.  It was not a drone.  We were driving on I-265 South...   It was the strangest thing I’ve ever seen.  The way it moved was so strange.  And the blinking did not resemble that of a plane.  There were no clouds and it didn’t disappear into any trees.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081

The moment I stepped outside my patio door, something in the night sky caught my eye. I look up and notice one very bright unusually placed 'star' in the sky. It was very low, just above the horizon line.  It was flashing.  And I don't mean twinkle twinkle, it was flashing brightly what seemed to be blue-ish/ yellowish colored lights.  So I took out my phone and started recording.  At this time I noticed 2 other stars doing the exact same thing only they were further away, higher in the sky and not flashing as brightly as the one low to the horizon.  The shape was triangular with the brightest 'star' at the bottom or tip.  It did not move across the sky however I did hear a far away humming sound.  My dog kept looking out the window with her tail down between her legs crying. I have video footage. I have been noticing a lot of strange things in our skys recently. I have a weird feeling that something bigger than us is coming. And I am not one of those creepy end of the world is nearing people.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081

To me this light was luminous and soft white with some pink/purple light and appeared to be falling/descending so I at first thought it was a firework but realized it was not.  And I watched as it just disappeared in the sky.  My partner saw same light but to him he saw the light fall as I saw it do, but he said he saw it spiral after it “fell” then shoot off into the distance (away from us) at a rapid speed.

I accidentally hit the stop button at the 10 second mark and by the time I was ready to film it again it disappeared just like it suddenly appeared.it wasn’t a drone it was silent and about 50 yards from me.

Numerous lights moving in a single file seen in the nighttime sky.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-28 21:30:00;5 MINUTES;Numerous lights moving in a single file seen in the nighttime sky Numerous lights that were the size of a typical size star in the nighttime sky were seen by myself and my wife.  The lights moved about the speed of a jet plane, perhaps a little faster.  The lights were all in a single row following each other in unison and spaced exactly the same distance from each other, perhaps 4-5 seconds apart in their travel speed.  The seemingly endless amount of lights kept appearing one by one out of the NNW skies, somewhat over the Louisville International Airport, and moved to the ESE one by one until each one would fade out of view. After about 5 minutes of viewing this event, the last light appeared out of the NNW and finally faded out of view to the ESE as all the other lights did. I do not know how long this event occurred because when I stepped outside and looked up into the sky as I normally do each evening the lights were already there. My wife and I watched them for about 5 minutes or so. No sounds emanated from the lights a! nd none of the lights were blinking, they were each just a steady whiteish-yellowish light. The elevation was hard to estimate, but they appeared to be at least as high as a commercial jetliner, perhaps much higher. They definitely were not close to the earth however. I would estimate that we witnessed 60-100 lights in the 5 minutes that we watched them. Though I did not witness this, my wife said at one point that some of the lights in the single line of lights split into a V-shape and came to a stop for 5-6 seconds and immediately began traveling the exact opposite direction.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081
&quotstar&quot seen climbing vertically in the sky.;2020-07-13 03:00:00;30 seconds;&quotstar&quot seen climbing vertically in the sky. My girlfriend and I had woken up from a nap at around 3:00am.  We went out on her balcony so 8 could smoke.  After about thirty minutes, she was looking over my shoulder to the northwest and asked what's that light in the sky over there?   I looked to my right and saw a light that looked like a distant star, but it was far too low to be a star.  It was ascending straight up and would blink intermittently.  It wasn't moving extremely fast, and would pause at different intervals.  The fact that it was going directly vertical was what was odd about it.  It wasn't a plane, helicopter or a drone.  A drone doesn't fly that high and planes or helicopters don't climb upwards in a direct line. I'm not sure what the object was, but I'm sure it wasn't a plane, helicopter, drone or meteor.   This happened in Jefferson county near the bullitt county line.  It eventually climb up into the clouds and we lost sight of it.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081
