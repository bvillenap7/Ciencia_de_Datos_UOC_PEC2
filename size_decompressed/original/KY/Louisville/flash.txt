I stepped out of my car and saw a flash of light above the roofline of my neighbor's house.  At first I believed someone had set off a firework display, but immediately realized something was odd about it.  For one, there was no sound at all, no pop or boom that would accompany a firework going off.  Also it lasted only a split second and it was very condensed. It did not expand and then slowly fade out as a firework would.  This was simply there and then it was gone as if it winked out or it was moving very fast.  I only saw it for literally a second, but i remember there were multiple bright colors of lights. I would describe it as a smear in the sky of bright pink, green, blue, maybe others.  Individual points of colored lights of various brightness. I just kind of stood there a few moments waiting to see if i could see it again.  I got in and out of the car a couple times to make sure i wasn't just seeing a reflection or something.  The sky was clear and there w! as no lightning or any weather effect that I could determine.  I realize a split second sighting is essentially useless, unless somebody else happened to see something odd last night, but whatever it was, it struck me as odd.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081
