huge craft;2004-03-23 04:10:00;2 minutes;huge craft This up-side cone shape thing was moving very slow and at one point stopped for a few seconds and started moving slow again then picked up speed. This was at new cut road in louisville ky. I saw this thing and got out of the car, this craft was huge, It was approx. 1-1 1/2 miles away looking at a 45 degree angle, so therefore, if I had to guess, it was approx. 2 miles from ground zero. Had 4 lights that was visible, 2 on the top and 2 on the bottom. Flavor was unidentifyable. It was moving unidirectional W-NW. The weather was clear, no clouds at all. Temp was at 32 degrees. When I was out of the car,I heard on sound at all. From considering the distance and the size, from the bottom, it had to be at least 300 yards long, top was possible 1/2 that. This had to be the mother of the mother ships. This was not a plane, bird, chopper, or a fly on my windshield, I know what I saw. These were not local boys for sure. A little about myself, I have a degree in criminal justice, private Investigations and certified in missing persons and studied bounty hunting and fingerprinting, I work on facts and facts only,,, and this is a fact.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081
Black cone seen in broad daylight in Louisville, KY;2009-01-28 12:45:00;5 minutes;Black cone seen in broad daylight in Louisville, KY I was coming back from lunch and saw a black object in the sky to my right.  I watched it as I drove and then pulled off the road to get a better view and determine its speed, size, etc.  It was cone-shaped, with the open part up, but very nearly an isosceles triangle from my vantage point. It had what appeared to be a thin rod projecting from the bottom point of the cone.  At the end of the rod there appeared to be a shiny sphere. I watched it as it floated in a stationary position.  After about 3 minutes, a C130 took off from SDF, flew by the UFO, and then headed west.  The UFO then almost immediatly headed east and increased its altitude.  The craft appeared to move at about the speed of a helicopter, but remained perfectly vertical from what I could tell. This craft was completely black except for the shiny sphere at the end of the rod.  My theory is that its visual stealthing wasn't working properly.  I did not take a photo because I was concerned about getting in trouble.  My assumption at that point was that it was a US military stealth drone of some sort.  Now I'm not so sure and wish I had a picture so that I would know that I didn't halucinate. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
