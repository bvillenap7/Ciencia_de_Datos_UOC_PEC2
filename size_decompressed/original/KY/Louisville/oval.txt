I noticed an object in the sky toward South Third Street. It was a rotating Oval like a blimp. Southend. At about 11:15pm I took out the trash and on the way back to the house I noticed an object in the sky toward South Third Street. I can describe it best as a rotating oval with green lights around it. I at first thought it was a blimp but quickly realized that is was not anything I have ever seen before. It moved Northward at a slow rate. Slow enough I ran inside, told my friend who followed, and ran out the back door to follow its progress and was able to still see it on the way moving north. I then decided to get in the car and chase it. I turned onto Third and drove north passing Iroquois Manor. I then turned up Kingston heading toward Southern Pkwy at which time I again could see the object near Iroquois Park. I lost it behind some trees then and never saw it again. We both saw this and are certain it wasn't any conventional aricraft.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081
My 2 children and I saw 2 oval objects in the sky above the sunset over a busy interstate, I took pictures.;2004-10-02 19:30:00;5 minutes;My 2 children and I saw 2 oval objects in the sky above the sunset over a busy interstate, I took pictures. My two children and I were driving into the sunset when we saw 2 oval objects in the sky. One was vertical, the other close by and slanted horizontally toward the other. They were steady and maybe moving toward each other. When we were directly underneath them they disappeared. We were on a very busy interstate intersection and I am sure others saw this too as the backdrop was a gorgeous sunset. I took two pictures (this is not a good idea to do while driving by my camera was by my seat). The objects do not have a definite shape but are bright white with a halo of light around them. I had a meteorolgist friend check these pictures and he ruled out clouds, ice and weather balloons. I would love an explanation! Did someone else also see these above Hway. 64 east of the 264 exchange?;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081
the object moving erratically lasting for approximately 10 seconds near airport  500 Lights On Object0: Yes;2009-02-07 07:40:00;10 seconds;the object moving erratically lasting for approximately 10 seconds near airport  I work in the aviation business in Louisville, KY. On February 7, 2009, I was on ramp #1 of SDF airport watching the sunrise from my vehicle. It was around 7:40 in the morning. As the sun rose above the horizon, it quickly ascended into the blanket of clouds reaching beyond me. I proceeded to drive away, then I remembered I needed to go pick up some paperwork. I immediately turned back around and drove past where I was parked. After I drove for quarter of mile I was facing the security entrance which faces the southeast. As I was driving, I something caught my eye just above the security entrance below the blanket of clouds. I said to myself I have never seen a cloud that round before. The round object stayed there for five to ten seconds and then it went up into the blanket of clouds. I saw a shadow of the object moving erratically lasting for approximately 10 seconds. The shadow then disappeared.  The conditions of the day were mostly cloudy. The ceiling was 3100 feet, winds were 18 mph from the Southwest and wind gust 26 mph. Temperature was 54 degrees and visibility of 10 miles.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081
Very large red orb, changing to green. Silent and hovering, then making unnatural maneuver.;2011-11-25 04:55:00;12 minutes;Very large red orb, changing to green. Silent and hovering, then making unnatural maneuver. During the morning of November 25th 2011 at 4:55 am I witnessed a bright red orb in the northeastern sky.  The object continued to hover in the same spot for some 12 minutes.  It was unlike anything that I've ever witnessed and at one point changed to a very bright blue/green color.  After realizing that this could not have been a helicopter because it made no sound whatsoever yet was within 1/2 a mile from my location, my concern prompted me to wake my roommate.  We were both in amazement because again, we had both never seen this type of foreign abject before. Quoting my roommate I've been looking my whole life to spot a ufo and as much as I've wanted to see one, I can truly say that until this moment I never have   We both cannot believe that this object can in any way be of this world. After observing for about 12 minutes the object suddenly moved vertically at a medium speed, then in a flash moved horizontally to the west and disappeared.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081

I had my cruise control set at 60m.ph, radio turned off, and windows partially down.   Around the zorn avenue exit, right outside of downtown Louisville.  I noticed about a half a mile ahead of me and on the other side of the highway, a object above the tree line. (TREE LINE RUNS DOWN BOTH SIDES OF ENTIRE HIGHWAY)   My first thought was wow that helicopter, plane is flying low.  Thats when the cruise control came off and i slowed to around 45m.p.h.  The object started moving across the highway, at a northwestern fashion.  This object was about 200 feet above the ground, about the size of a mini van or large car, and made no noise.  What made me notice this object was the lights, it had a series of bright green and extremely vivid colored lights on the bottom or belly in a V shape or triangl! e.  With the green lights at the corners.  There was also one red light in the middle that pulsed slowly, almost like a heartbeat.    I watched this thing fly directly over top of my car.  Looking through my windshield and up over my steering wheel, i noticed the silouette only because of the close by downtown city lights.  The object had round edges   almost like a football but wider, that made up the entire craft.  It was really strange,  the whole time i couldn't see the object only the lights, but they were so bright i dont understand how they didnt light up any part of this object, they should have, but this was black or cloaked is best described.  I continued to watch as it flew over and past me above the tree line on my side of highway.  I was able to see this object from the front, from its side, and from its rear.  No other lights were on this object at all, and living by Louisville you know what planes, helicopters, commercial and even some military aircraft look an! d sound like.  F.A.A requires all aircraft to use a red light ! on one s ide or wing, a green on the other and a white flashing light at the rear.  This object had only  lights on the bottom, nowhere else.   This is by far probably the strangest thing ive ever seen, and would really love to know what it was.   It wasnt a helicopter, it wasnt a plane, it wasnt a toy or R.c because it was too big, and think to myself would military be flying some drone or black ops over a highway with bright green lights, it doesnt make sense to me.  I hope someone else saw this thing because for right now im sleepin with my pistol close by.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081
