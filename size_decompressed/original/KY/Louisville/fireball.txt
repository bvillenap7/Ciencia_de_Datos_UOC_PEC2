The color was orange and it was high as the space shuttle orbit, it came out of the south going north at a fairly fast pace, it never moved from its path, it went out of sight to the north!  It was not an air plane because it was flying at a very high distance in space like the shuttle flys today!!! It was the size of a pea to my eye sight because of its height i could not tell what the ufo was but i think it was not one of ours!!!1 ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting in December 1975 appears to be approximate.

A hovering ball of orange light that came back twice;1997-03-01 21:20:00;2 seconds;A hovering ball of orange light that came back twice I was watching TV on my couch and I saw (through the glass sliding door) an orange/reddish ball of light come down and hover for about two seconds. I turn to see what I saw out of the corner of my eye and I caught a glimpse of it, but it sped away. So I figured I was crazy and there was nothing, like a flare or something. Ten minutes later the ball of light followed the same pattern, down from the sky (into my view) and off to the upper right. But what really convinced me was the hovering. Flares don't hover, but I guess they can be picked up by the wind. I kinda got freaked out, but I ran outside and waited for about 30 minutes and it never came back. I don't live in a podunk part of Louisville, I live in a well populated area. Anyway I hope that this small encounter helps let somebody else share their close encounter of the thrid kind someday. It didn't look like a 1950's disk, so that's why I ignored it the first time. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081
Single bright fireball with fire trail and sparks, very far out and high up, fast moving from southwest to northeast, obviously massive;1999-11-16 19:10:00;10 SECONDS;Single bright fireball with fire trail and sparks, very far out and high up, fast moving from southwest to northeast, obviously massive. This was not a craft, but a meteor.  I was out doors when I caught sight of the object for about 10 seconds, about 20-30 degrees above the horizon when it was northwest of my position, and it was moving in a generally southwest to northeast direction.  It was very obviously far away, fast moving, and high in the atmosphere.  Just from my own perception and from it's rate of travel and straight path, it was obvious to me that the object was very massive and huge, MOUNTAIN-scale.  It was travelling in an inertial straight line skimming the atmosphere, leaving a fire trail and sparks behind as it went.  I would definitely qualify it as almost an asteroidal near miss event.  It was far enough up that it was seen throughout northeast USA.  There was videotape of it shown on local television.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081

3 orange fireball crafts traveling at an enormous speed but very high, meeting up and vanishing.;2010-07-04 20:00:00;5-10 minutes;3 orange fireball crafts traveling at an enormous speed but very high, meeting up and vanishing. I was on the waterfont (Ohio River) of Louisville, Kentucky on 2010 4th of July.   A concert was going on and fireworks were to be expected later.   I happened to look up and noticed a craft that was unexplainable.  I studied harder and harder, as did my boyfriend and human aircraft was not coming up as a logical option.  It was traveling very fast but you could tell it was so high that it wasn't going from point A to B in a snap, as others describe sightings often.  It was the type of thing that when you looked away for a few seconds, and tried again to sight it, it would be much further east.  (Kentucky facing Indiana).   Eventually it got to be at such an elevation, it was hard to keep up with and make out anymore.  Moments later, I noticed even further southeast, it seemed to have two other identical objects waiting for it.  As my boyfriend and I were making our way to the port-o-john's, also in their direction, we looked up and all three were gone.  He said others around us were pointing and had also noticed.  This would have been a great time to discuss it with others had it not been for the loud music.   I was so perturbed, I came home and googled it instantly and found that someone else on www.godlikeproductions.com had witnessed the same thing as well as his wife.  He remains anonymous, but I suggested that it is okay, I saw the exact same thing, and he and I both captured it with camera.  I had seven still photos, and am regretting not video taping it.   I have always been intrigued by extra-terrestrials as well as government cover up and am excited and feel betrayed at the same time.  I am so desperate to know more.

Red/Orange fireballs over Louisville, KY, USA on New Year's 2012;2012-01-01 00:30:00;15-20 mins;Red/Orange fireballs over Louisville, KY, USA on New Year's 2012 Right after midnight on New Years Eve, I witnessed strange lights in the sky near Shenanigans Pub (Corner of Norris and Deerwood) in Louisville. Several other patrons saw the lights and I was able to snap a few photos (attached) and my friend was able to record some video. The lights were orange glowing balls and travelled generally south to north and appeared to be powered. Ambient noise from the bar was loud so I couldn't hear if the lights made any noise. They travelled one after another along the same path at erratic intervals, although usually around twenty or thirty seconds apart. They travelled in a straight flight path and that path generally drifted and changed to the northwest as the event took place. They were below the cloud cover, but one did go through the lowest clouds. I estimate I saw around twenty and that the whole event lasted 10 or 20 minutes. To recap, they travelled at approximately the same altitude and along the same path. They glowed a dark orange and didn’t seem to flash. When viewing them through my camera phone they seemed to flash at a constant rate. My friend who also witnessed the event is a pilot and called Standiford Field air traffic control (Louisville International Airport) and they said they had nothing flying in the area. Both of us called the police and the dispatcher said we were the only people to call it in. And we called a local news station tip line who told us we were the only callers to report the event. I also emailed all four local news stations with the facts and photos on January 1st and received no response. Finally, in one of the photos some non-glowing spots are visible. I’m didn’t see those during the event so I’m not sure if they are due to reflections or some other camera error, or if they are related to the event.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081
Large pale yellow ball of light seen over Louisville Kentucky.;2012-02-15 17:00:00;2 minutes;Large pale yellow ball of light seen over Louisville Kentucky On or about February 2012, in Louisville, Kentucky, I was driving home from work.  It was around 5:00pm and I was traveling in a northerly direction. I was just about to take my exit from one expressway to another when I noticed to my left an odd little cloud that was lit up from behind and was displaying rainbow colors.  I kept looking at it trying to figure out what it was. In addition, right in front of me was a huge ball of beautiful pale yellow light, not moving at all, just hanging there in the sky.  At the time I thought was the sun.  It was massive and it didn’t hurt the eyes to look directly at it.  It was like looking at the sun through a gauzy haze. The oddly colorful and brightly lit cloud to my left captured my attention.  As I continued to drive, I was looking from the ball of light in front of me, to the anomaly on my left.  I was observing other drivers to see if anyone else noticed anything out of the ordinary and no one seemed to.  Unfortunately, I was unable to pull over to examine it more closely due to heavy traffic and the lack of a safe place to do so. It was the next day while traveling home at the same time of day and the same route that I realized that the anomaly to my left I had witnessed the day before was actually the sun shining through a cloud and that the large ball of light was the true anomaly.   I still marvel to this day about what it could have been and I regret not pulling off the highway to get a better look.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081
4 Glowing Orbs/Fireballs in NE Louisville.;2013-12-02 20:00:00;3 minutes;4 Glowing Orbs/Fireballs in NE Louisville. I was out walking my dogs in the back yard when I saw 2 strange lights in the west sky (I live in North Eastern Louisville).  They were travelling in the same direction and one was in front of the other.  I can’t say how large they were or how far apart they were due to the distance.  However, they appeared to be travelling over the Indian Hills area in North Eastern Jefferson County. At first I thought they were floating Chinese lanterns, but I determined that they could not be lanterns due to the speed at which they were travelling.  They seemed to glow orange/gold and flicker sporadically.  I immediately took out my iPhone camera and videotaped the lights, but they were so small in the video.  I then noticed that there was another light in front of the other two, also travelling the same direction.  As I ran up to the house, the first light faded into the cloud cover. When I reached the house, my daughter joined me outside and she also captured video of the two remaining objects.  As the 2 closest ones were starting to fade into the clouds, one final light appeared through the trees, following the previous three.  We both agreed that these were not a normal aircraft that we are familiar with  UFOs by definition.  The area where the objects appeared is close to the flight path that passenger jets use as they round into their landing pattern at the Louisville airport.  However, these lights appeared much lower than any jet would travel, and there was no sound.  There were no blinking lights on the objects, just the occasional flickering.  The objects appeared as if they were completely illuminated glowing.  They were close enough to see that they had some mass, not just a light in the sky.  But I couldn’t determine how large they were.  And they all had the same steady pace and straight flight.  I wouldn’t say they were speeding across the sky, but they were travelling faster than wind would carry the objects.  Also, the wind was travelling ESE (1 mph) and these objects were travelling NW.  I could submit my video, but you can only see 2 pinpoints of light, not any of the details that I described.  I haven't seen my daughter's video yet.  I’ve seen comets, meteors and satellites and I know these objects were none of those things. I’ve never been a big believer in UFOs but I didn’t disbelieve either.  What we saw tonight isn’t something that would make me say that we definitely saw alien craft, but I can say it was very strange and unlike anything that I've ever seen.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081
