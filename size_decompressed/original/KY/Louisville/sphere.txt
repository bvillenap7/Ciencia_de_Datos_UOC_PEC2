It traveled at our side for abour 5 minutes then disapeared! At apromitley 16:45, my mother and I were heading towards a grocery store about 10 miles away from our house. Everything was usuall and normal we were listening to the radio, going over our grocery list, when suddenly the radio started to make strange noises and then it just sort of exploded. There was no fire, but there was a bunch of smoke. By around 17:05 my mom had driven to the nearest car repair station and we got out of the car. The repair man was unable to fix the radio, we just left to go grocery shopping again. At this time, it was around 17:15. We were on the highway, and it seemed as though our car was the only one on the highway for miles. Then suddenly, there was this huge sphere-shaped, metallic-colored, metal sphere flying striaght at us(17:27). Luckly, my mom svered to the left just in time! But that was not the last of the monstrous metal sphere it came back, only this time it was flyng at the exact same speed my mom was driving it was right next to my mom's car door! After about 5 minutes of that, it just disapeared!;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081

6 orbs moving in formation high above the atmosphere;2006-08-24 02:00:00;3 Hours;6 orbs moving in formation high above the atmosphere I was looking up at the sky, I noticed a new set of stars, I thought it was because the new solstice was comming or something and the constalations were changing. As i looked at these stars they began to move irraticaly, the main formation was one sphere in the center surrounded by 5 other Spheres evenly but they were all pretty much moving in sync. Judging by the speed of the objects and the distance they traveld (which wasnt a long distance) i would say these objects were atleast 3 miles above the atmosphere. I went to check on these stars the next night and they wernt there.( i looked at the same time);38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081
Two metallic shperes hovering in broad daylight then vanishing;2007-08-26 16:30:00;2 minutes;Two metallic shperes hovering in broad daylight then vanishing It was a clear and mild Sunday afternoon around 4:30pm when myself and a friend were standing in an alley way in front of his garage talking. As we talked I was glancing down the alley and up into the sky and thinking about what a nice day it was when I noticed object in the sky about 45 degrees up from the horizon. It was something I have never seen before or since with my own eyes. I mentioned to my friend the object and he saw it and then noticed a second similar object almost directly above us. The one above us appeared to be closer so we focused on that. I immediately got my binoculars out to have a closer look. The object was metallic and appeared to be circular, or an orb. I would have to say the object was a bit larger than a BB if you held one an arms length away. The objects did not drift or move. They were stationary in their positions for at least two minutes then they just vanished.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081

We were standing in the alley at the garage of a friends house in Old Louisville on a sunny, cloudless Sunday afternoon. I happen to look north down the alley and up into the sky and noticed an object hovering about 45 degrees from the horizon. I asked my friend what he thought it might be and he said he didnt know and there was another one just like it directly above us. The one above us appeared to be larger. I immediately got my binoculars from my truck and had another look. It was a dull metallic sphere and appeared to be getting smaller or it was going straight up. About this time there was what appeared to be a jet plane flying between the objects and as it passed, the objects just simply vanished. The objects did not drift or move from thier position. I could not tell how big they were or the distance from us. However the jet plane I estimated to be around 30,000 feet up. My friend and I are middle aged and just regular guys. I was returning his ladder I had borrowed and we had just put it away in his garage and just hanging out in the alley talking when the event occurred.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081

orbs out my window came together and flew away;2008-04-02 01:20:00;45 sec;orbs out my window came together and flew away I went to bed just before 1:00am and as I was laying in bed watching TV when all electronics in my room went off suddenly after my cable box went blank and began to display static. This was no more than 20-30 min after I laid down. A bright blue-white light came bursting through my window. I jumped to the end of my bed and opened my blinds expecting to see a helicopter. To my surprise there were 3 orbs out my window. They were all a red purple color, about 2 ft wide, yet they didn’t seem to illuminate any light. The light seemed to be almost internal rather than radiating. The objects were stationary for probably about 10 seconds when they all moved together in line. They seemed to now form one object with the center orb now becoming a blue oval. As soon as the objects merged together the one object moved slowly away and seemed to just blink away. The power only went off in my room of the house. No other room was effected. Only the clocks and other electronics in my room were effected. This experience completely baffled me. I researched everything I could find. My family thought it was a dream until the next day there were, and still are, circular areas of dead vegetation about 2.5’ wide. I cant explain what happened but whatever it was, it was real I have dead spots surrounded by healthy green plants.

Bright orange objects over Louisville, KY;2012-07-04 22:30:00;10 minutes;Bright orange objects over Louisville, KY I stepped outside with a friend to get some air and noticed a round orange &quotfireball&quot object going from the northwest to the southeast approximately 1000 to 1500 feet above the ground.  The light was moving about the same speed as a small plane, and was moving steadily and in a different direction than the wind. At first, we thought it might be some type of Chinese lantern, but the object did not flicker and was moving slightly against the wind.  The object finally drifted into a hazy cloud bank and dissappeared. About 2 minutes later we spotted another object going in the same direction and speed but higher up and a little south of the first object.  We watched this object until it was obscured by some trees. The third onject was about a mile north of the first object and was only in view for a few seconds before being obscured by trees. The fourth object appeared about 3 minutes later, and was almost overhead.  The object was also going in the same general direction, but a little lower.   We watched it cross the sky for almost a minute before it just seemed to fade out. We waited for another 20 minutes but saw nothing further. These objects were a bright orange color, solidly lit, and moved in a steady speed and direction.  They did not flicker, and were not affected by the wind. We were both a little freaked out, and tried to rationalize the sightings with prosaic explanations like small planes, Chinese lanterns, balloons etc.  But there was no noise, and if they were balloons or lanterns, they would have to have been released a mile or two from each other, and at different times rather than from the same place and all at once. I sincerely hope someone else in the area noticed these objects too!   Although this was on the fourth of July, it had nothing to do with fireworks;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081
Several Unexplained Objects Flying Low in the Night Sky.;2013-02-16 22:20:00;5 minutes;Several Unexplained Objects Flying Low in the Night Sky My wife and I were driving home from celebrating Valentines Day dinner in Downtown Louisville, KY on 02/16/2013.  At approximately 10:20pm while driving northeast on Hurstbourne Lane towards I-64, we witnessed at least 20 glowing red orbs in the eastern sky towards the town of Shelbyville, KY.  The sky was overcast, with high winds, low cloud cover, and probably less than ten miles visibility. I hold a private pilot certificate and have worked several years in the aviation industry.  I know these were not manned aircraft for several reasons:   1.  	The bad weather/visibility would have prevented a large group of aircraft from flying in close formation at such low altitude. 2.	  There were no position lights.  U.S. powered aircraft always have a red light on the left wing, a green light on the right wing, and a white light on the tail.  Prudent pilots will always fly with a flashing omnidirectional beacon. 3.	  The orbs of light mostly stayed stationary in the sky and did not seem affected by the high winds. Occasionally the orbs would move vertically (both up and down) at high rates of speed. The sky was overcast, these were not stars. 4.	  They were bright red orbs. The intensity was strong and the light didn’t waver. 5.	  They were in a strange formation, some were higher/lower than others. They didn’t seem to be organized in any sensible pattern either horizontally or vertically. 6.	  They suddenly disappeared.  This video is very similar to what we saw, though there were many of them all at the same time:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zi-6DFe2fEg&list=PL4D428923123EF286   Possible explanations/problems with our sighting:   1.  	I thought they could have been sky lanterns (like those used in eastern cultures).  They seemed to be flying over part of the U of L extension campus. It’s possible that a group of students launched a bunch of them to celebrate Valentines Day weekend.  However, as stated before, there were really high winds that night and the orbs appeared to be relatively stationary in the sky.  The orbs also moved vertically at high rates of speed.  I have also scoured the internet to find news of celebrations involving sky lanterns.  I haven’t found anything.  We do not live in Louisville so we do not have ready access to their news outlets. 2.  	They could be helicopters flying in a rough formation.  The problem is: no position lights, it was overcast, very dark, with high winds, and really what would be the point?  I don’t see a bunch of pilots participating in a potentially dangerous flight at night with low visibility. 3.  	They could have been stars.  It was overcast, the orbs moved, and stars don’t shine red. 4.	  The only exasperating part of our experience is that I can find no evidence on the internet that anyone else witnessed what we saw!!  These were high enough in the sky that thousands of people could have potentially seen them.  It was a Saturday night on a holiday weekend. I would love to have an explanation for what we saw, or at least hear that someone else also witnessed this! If you have any information I would definitely be interested in hearing it. This was not my first experience with a UFO sighting in Louisville, KY. In 2000 I was working at Standiford Field (the Louisville Airport SDF) for the summer.  It was a warm night and the skies were crystal clear.  Several airline agents and I witnessed a large white lens shaped object seemingly floating in the night sky to the northwest.   We thought it might have been an advertising dirigible flying over Papa John’s Stadium.  However, it seemed to just suddenly appear.  We could not hear any engines (to indicate that it was powered). It was not present the night before, or the night after our sighting.  It did not move at all.   We contacted the control tower to ask what it was and they had no explanation.  There was nothing on their radar.  We had to work an inbound flight, but when we were done, the object in the sky was gone.  A possible explanation is that it might have been a large balloon tethered to the nearby stadium.  However I have several problems with this:   (1)  It was huge it appeared to be the size of the good year blimp. (2)  It had no top: there were clear skies and its top seemed to just fade into nothing. (3)  It did not move. (4)  There was no visible advertising on the side.  It seemed to be illuminated by the city lights below. (5)  It disappeared   (6) ATC (air traffic control) did not know what it was  (7) Standiford is a busy airport, and is a major hub for UPS. Huge cargo aircraft are constantly flying in and out of SDF all of the time (especially at night).  I do not see the FAA allowing such a huge balloon (if it was a ballon) to be tethered so close to the airport, especially at night. I would love to hear more information on this one as well.  We do not live in Louisville, but we do live in another major city nearby.  I find it ironic that both of my sightings have been in Louisville.  I’m still very skeptical, but just a little excited too.  I hope this information helps in some way.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081
Single bright light-orange orb moving from southwest to northeast at 9:15 PM on 12/31/13 in the 40207 ZIP Code of Louisville, KY.;2013-12-31 21:15:00;45 seconds;Single bright light-orange orb moving from southwest to northeast at 9:15 PM on 12/31/13 in the 40207 ZIP Code of Louisville, KY. I walked outside to my back patio about 9:15 PM on 12/31/13 (New Year’s Eve) and looked up at the sky.  I immediately spotted a single light-orange orb in the southwest part of the sky moving northeast at a moderate rate of speed.  It didn’t appear to be at a high altitude –maybe a couple of hundred feet above the ground (although I’m certainly not the best judge of distances).  If I were to have held up my thumb, it would have been just a bit smaller than the size of my thumbnail.  It passed to the west of me and I followed its path as it headed northeast until it disappeared. It was extremely bright.  I saw no blinking lights around it, as you see on planes. It had no form, like a plane, simply a brilliant ball of light.  And, what struck me as the strangest thing of all, was that it was completely silent. My husband and I spend many nights outside on the patio star-gazing.  Since we are very close to the flight path of Louisville International Airport, Bowman Field, and a TV station that has a helicopter landing pad, my husband and I are very familiar with all types of aircraft at all levels of altitude.  Even though we live relatively close to the city and the light pollution can sometimes be a problem, we can also spot satellites as they pass overhead. Despite our familiarity with the aircraft/spacecraft that fly over our home (we’ve lived here for 8 years), I couldn’t identify this as anything I’d ever seen in the past.  I remember asking myself, “What IS that?”  When it had disappeared (after being visible to me for about 45 seconds), I walked back inside and mentioned to my husband that I’d just seen something that I’d never seen before in my life.  I wondered silently to myself if I’d seen a UFO. A few days later, while checking the Internet, I found reports of people in California on New Year’s Eve spotting light orange orbs of light that were completely silent.  I was stunned.  I believe I saw exactly the same thing in Louisville, KY. (END);38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081

They glided silently as we observed them for approximately 4 to 5 minutes, then each independently made a slight left turn towards the northwest. We watched them for an additional minute before they one by one just seemingly vanished. Throughout the duration of our sighting the brightness and size of the three objects remained consistent until the moment they disappeared. Not long after the objects had disappeared, we heard the rotors of a helicopter.  The helicopter was traveling at a high rate of speed from the south, and appeared to be in pursuit of the objects as it flew over our home headed toward the exact point in the sky the objects had disappeared from our sight.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081
Bright red glowing sphere over louisville on the 4th of July - 2014.;2014-07-04 22:29:00;Several minutes;Bright red glowing sphere over louisville on the 4th of July - 2014 I was outside watching the fireworks on the 4th, and I looked up at the sky to my right to see a extremely bright red light.  The light was so bright that it surrounded the entire craft.  I was not able to see any shape of the craft because the light was so bright so I am going to say it was a sphere.  It did not flash, it was a static light.   The craft was relatively high up in the sky, but still below the cloud line.  It flew straight across from the right all the way past our front yard and off to the left.  Because of the height I did not hear any sound, but I still found that a bit odd because other craft around that altitude usually make some sort of noise.   The craft would pivot slightly to the left and right.  Sort of like a boat in rough seas.  Do not mistake this for the normal zipping across the sky  this looked more like wind was effecting it because it was moving at a relatively slow speed. There were no other lights other than the red.  No white lights, no strobes, etc... Having said that, I have to take an educated approach to this sighting.  Even though I might belive in something like this, there is always a possibility that there is a simple explination to this.   I thought to myself, well the slow speed and subtle pivoting, and bright red light... it could have been a helicopter.  But not a commercial one because of the bright red light, so then maybe a military helicopter.  But the fact that the light was so bright and no other strobing lights were on it, and there was no sound I am having a hard time accepting my own answer to this.  I have seen other military helicopters in the area and they are extremely loud.  And just to rule it out, it was moving way too fast to be a hot air balloon. We live near a small airfield (Bowman Field) and I see aircraft all the time, and am quite familiar with the lights on crafts.  I look in the sky several times a day waiting to find something, and sure enough I did!   This is honestly the first time I have been unable to explain this sighting and it is all I have been able to think about for days now.  I have seen everything from military helicopters, small planes, news helicopters, drones (about once a month) and now this. I have a very short video that I took of it, though my phone was low battery and shut off shortly after i started to record so I was unable to take any still images.  (go figure, just my luck).;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081

Bright white orb moving steadily cross the sky slowly until it swelled, retracted, and moved away at a high rate of speed.;2015-10-04 20:45:00;2 minutes;Bright white orb moving steadily cross the sky slowly until it swelled, retracted, and moved away at a high rate of speed. On 10/4/15, at approximately 20:30 EST, a bright white orb moving to slow to be an aircraft was observed in the area.  At first observation the object looked to be the ISS in orbit but as it moved closer to the area it became very obvious it was too low to be orbiting.  The object was inside the atmosphere and much lower to ground.   The object made no sound.  The object was observed to be twice the size of the ISS at closer range comparatively.  The object was observed to be at a range of approximately 1/2 mile away and an approximate altitude of 3000 feet but no more than 4000 feet.  The object was observe at an angle of approximately +40° to +42° traveling from the southwest at approximately 230° moving north at approximately 21°.  These numbers are based on a positive upward bubble.  The event could not be triangulated. After 1 minute of straight steady movement in the sky toward the area it came into clear sight.  The object covered the same distance moving away as it did coming toward the area.  After it cleared the area moving away it maintained its steady speed and altitude for approximately 30 seconds.  The event seemed to last less than 2 minutes. As the object was moving away from the area it swelled, retracted, maneuvered and moved away at an extreme high rate of speed.  The object left a short black streak in its wake before leaving the Earth's deep orbit. The object achieved greater than light speed due to an observable black streak or absence of light. The event did not cause silence of animals nor insects.  The event did not cause a feeling of emptiness or parole.  Only the fiery spheres cause this type of event on the ground. Based on this observation, it was a different species than the red fiery orbs.  The red fiery orbs move at an altitude of approximately 1000 to 2000 feet and much slower. I have observed 4 of the red fiery orbs over the past 2 years.  I only include that because you are most interested in the red fiery orbs.  The silence on the ground and the feeling of emptiness and/or parole seems to be a natural defense.  I have watched the trail of sightings of these red fiery orbs reported so I felt it not necessary to do so. The fact that this seems to be a different species, I felt more compelled to report the event. I felt as if it was looking for something very specific.  On a most personal note, I felt compelled to stay with it and keep watching.  I actually ran to clear the trees to keep watching.  I experienced a feeling of extreme enthusiasm and deep curiosity like a child would.  When I observed the object moving away from the area at an extreme high rate of speed I had a feeling of almost sadness.  Something close to abandonment.  The feeling was almost opposite the red fiery orbs. I have also observed other objects maneuvering in the sky in different states in the US.  The past 20 to 25 years I have observed several objects but in the past 2 years I have observed almost as many.  Activity of these objects has increased almost exponentially.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081

My mother also was outside on the ground and saw the same 6 mysterious spears following behind one another. 2 or 3 spears came 2 mins after the first siting.  Note that they did not blink red, white or blue lights for the entire sighting.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081

Blue moon falls right out of the sky;2020-11-05 19:15:00;5 seconds;Blue moon falls right out of the sky Tonight 11/05/2020 approximately 7:15pm in Louisville, Kentucky I witnessed what I can only conclude as a UFO in the night sky. The only way I can describe what I saw is by saying that it looked like the moon fell out of the sky. It was a silver-blue orb in the sky that darted toward the horizon in less than 5 seconds. It has been a relatively clear night sky but the orb in question had a halo effect around the center that made it appear as though it were shining behind a cloud sheet. From where I was standing at the time it appeared to be moving either south or south west. Unfortunately, I did not have a view of the horizon line at the time of the incident, but it certainly did look as though something was falling and not flying given how fast the object moved. The city of Louisville has a lot of air traffic so most people can attest to seeing large aircrafts in the sky at almost any given time of day. In fact, at the time of the incident, there was an airplane in the same line of sight as the strange object. There are no comparisons between the mystery object and the airplane at all. The lights on the airplane were smaller and more clearly visible than the large moon-like object I saw, which leads me to believe the object was either further away than the airplane or at a higher altitude. I was the only person in my party at the time of the event and I can not verify any other witnesses. I was in a high-traffic area in a small metropolitan during the time of the event so I would make the assumption others would have seen it in the area. My only concern is that because the city has so much air traffic flow others might mistake the object as a local air craft. My first instinct was to write it off as an aircraft as well. I probably wouldn’t have reported it either except the whole scenario kept bugging me. I do not have any knowledge of air traffic control or flight patterns, however I do have many years experience in the field of optics and I can say that whatever I saw was not an illusion or trick of the light. I did go through the trouble of making an illustration of what I saw, and provided map details as well. Originally I thought I was seeing the object moving north or north-east but after looking further into the details I realize it’s more like south or southwest.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081
