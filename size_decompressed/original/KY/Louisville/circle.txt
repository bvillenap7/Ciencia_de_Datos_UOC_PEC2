UFO Sighted Thursday June 30, 1988 at about 23:15 N of Elizabethtown and S of Louiseville on I-65 close to State Park;1988-06-30 23:15:00;3 minutes;UFO Sighted Thursday June 30, 1988 at about 23:15 N of Elizabethtown and S of Louiseville on I-65 close to State Park The date was Thursday June 30th, 1988 shortly after 11 PM. I was moving from Houston TX to Metro Detroit MI. I was traveling alone in a huge 26' Ryder Rental Truck while towing my 1985 Cavelier on a tow dolly behind.  I was heading North out of Elizabethtown, KY but was still well South of Lousville, KY on I-65. I saw a State Park sign coming up so I decided to pull over at that exit and just sleep on the shoulder on the side of the road near the highway so I could get an early start with out getting lost in the morning, plus I was not very acclimated with the procedures needed to back this monster mobile up.  Anyway I merged into the exit lane and turned right onto this road (name forgotten).  I proceeded probably a mile or more down this road so I was far enough away to not hear the noise of the occaisonal semi going up the hills on the Interstate.  I pulled off on the right shoulder, went over a hill and stopped near the bottom of the grade.  I engaged the emergency brake and cut the truck motor.  I was smoking a cig and just getting ready lay down on the bench seat and try to get a couple hours sleep before continuing.  Suddenly, I noticed that the interior of the cab was gradually getting lighter.  Mind you, I am out in the middle of nowhere parked by the exterior boundaries of a state park.  Of course I figured it was a car or vehicle of some kind.  Damn if wasn't a vehicle of some kind!  The interior of the truck cab continued to get brighter seeming from behind, but I could not see a vehicle on the road behind me.  The lights go so bright it was kind of freaking me out a little.  I looked out the passenger window and could see some kind of multi-colored lights on what appeared to be some type of flying saucer. I could not see the whole thing, but it was slowing moving over a hill south of me with an approach that seemed to be coming towards me.  I could not take this suspense.  This was a moment when I realized that whatever this was, it was a lot more powerful than I was.  I got out of the truck and stood between the truck and trailer watching this thing approach me.  I made such an effort to hear something as it came closer but I heard not a sound.  Not a single sound.  No wildlife, no bugs, no flying saucer.  But I could see it!  It was not shing a light on me as it was just illuminating the darkness.  It continued to move slowly never varying its speed.  The object appeared to be huge.  My perception was that it was roughly 200 feet across.  I walked to the back of the trailer giving up my false refuge because I really couldn't believe what I was seeing.  The object continued north and went over the next hill seemingly to flew just over the tree tops.  When the lights faded I got back in the truck ane locked the doors. I played the radio for about 5 minutes to help myself calm down.  I decided I really was exhausted even though I had just witnessed an amazing thing.  I turned off the radio, double checked the door locks, and fell asleep.  The next morning about 4:30 I woke up and thought about what I saw.  I actually tried to rationalize that I did not see what I thought I did. I went to start the truck, and the battery was dead.  Last night I only ran the radio for about 5 minutes before I turned it off.  As luck would have it.  I had parked on a slight incline so I release the emergecy brake, put it in neutral and we started rolling downhill.  I pushed in the clutch, put it in 1st and popped the Clutch.  She started right up.  Just coincidence I thought.  I found the entrance to the park further down the road on the right and made a wide U-turn to go back towards I-65 North.  Hours Later I picked up a station from LIMA Ohio that said there had been multiple UFO sightings the night before.  They even gave out a phone number to call if you had seen it. It was probably just their number they were giving out and not an official number, but I was just excited that somebody had seen something last evening and they were describing similar sightings.  I know these areas are 250 miles apart, but it seemed to give my version credability again.  I know it was a UFO because I could not IDENTIFY if. Nor have I seen anything like it since.  I told this story a lot at first, but based on the looks people give you, I very rarely tell it anymore. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of the event may be approximate.  PD));38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081

While flying our corporate jet, at 45,000 feet, while heading NNW, from a position approx. 75 NM S. of Louisville, KY, between 1730 and 1745 CST, (2330Z and 2345Z), each of two crewmembers observed a white flashing strobe light, WELL, (I mean WELL!), above our altitude, North of our position, at a distance estimated to be between 20 and 50 NM. (It appeared to be flying throught the cup of the big dipper!) Having witnessed militatry aircraft ABOVE our cruise altitude in the past, (ie. 60,000 feet), we thought we would query the air traffic controllers as to the source of this strobe. (Interesting to note... very shortly after we mentioned this over the radio, the blinking strobe light stopped entirely.) After mentioning this sighting to two different air traffic controllers, the second offered the UFO Center phone and web sight address...  We continue to feel that we wittnessed a military aircraft of some kind, however we could not get any confirmation from ATC.  By the way, ATC mentioned that their radar coverage reaches up to 99,000 feet! A UFO, maybe? Possibly some new military Hot Stuff?? Maybe you could confirm?! Thanx and Happy Landings!

I SHOT A 12 SECOND VIDEO OF UFO ABOVE CHURCHILL DOWNS ON DERBY DAY MORN.;1999-05-01 10:10:00;12 seconds;((NUFORC Note:  The gentleman who submitted the report was kind enough to forward his video to NUFORC.  The object is not inconsistent with some white, round object, and it does disappear from sight on several occasions.  However, because of the momentary blurring of the edge of the object just before it disappears, we believe that this characteristic probably is due to the autofocus function of the video camera.  We will continue to analyze the video tape.)) I SHOT A 12 SECOND VIDEO OF UFO ABOVE CHURCHILL DOWNS ON DERBY DAY MORN.

I was watching TV with my daughter when I was distracted by an unusually bright white and red flickering light out the northwest window of my home.  I said to my daughter to look and we both asked, WHAT IS THAT?   It was larger than a plane that we're use to seeing in the area as we live close to a UPS hub.  The object was circular and flickering with a white light and a red light in the middle.   It seemed to have a life of its own and was only visible for about 30 to 40 seconds before disappearing.  There was no sound coming from it.   I am 63 years old and my daughter is 27.  We are still puzzled but both of us are of sound mind and agree that we saw something very unusual.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081

The sighting was at approx. 9:20p.m est.   The first light was well ahead of four lights that were in a diamond pattern as a sixth light followed far behind them all.   As I watched them for a couple of minutes the last light in the diamond formation dropped quickly and then leveled out.  Shortly after that the lights turned off except the last light which was still far behind.   As the last light approached the vicinity were the other lights had turned off, it as well turned off at that point.  I was able to take a couple of pictures on my phone.;38.221889317266;-85.6625921642081

First it was assumed to be medical personal or military in origin.  Craft materialized from a bright light, and was not at first identified as the object in question.  Then the object, over the course of several minutes, worked its way over head of the observer/narrator.  The object was easily 50 feet in length with different color lights on the ends of red blue and green.  It was circular except for the north and south ends of the object having a jagged and horizontal edges.  Object stayed straight moving right passed the observer, until it faded into the distance. No upwards movement was observed, and the object quickly faded from view.  It did have a noise, and was not silent.  However the object did move awkwardly for a b52/757 style craft.

They were probably several miles away and what looked to be about several thousand feet up.  From my vantage point they were relatively small, but large enough to be very noticeable.  At one point there were several visible in the sky at once but for the duration generally one object would become noticeable then disappear as another object became noticeable.  I am very certain that these were not birds as they flew rather fast and disappeared.  I can't be certain however, but I don't submit something like this if I don't believe this was something extraordinary.
