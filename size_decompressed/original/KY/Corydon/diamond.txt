Diamond shaped orbs with two additional.;2018-02-02 11:30:00;12:07;Diamond shaped orbs with two additional. Was driving on the highway towards Louisville and off to the right side about 5 miles before Corydon, Indiana.  The shape looked like itâ€™s bottom was turned sideways and there was a diamond shape of 4 orbs with 2 orbs protruding from 2 sides of the diamond.  They were very bright blue and then the lights started tilting as the craft was picking up speed it is currently moving east and gaining altitude.  I would have to estimate the craft at a half mile to a mile wide.;37.7448;-87.6957
