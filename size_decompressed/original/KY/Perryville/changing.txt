I witnessed from my porch a aircraft of some fashion that seemed to appear out of nothing the shape was hard to recall as it seemed to pulse and shape shift, it had a blue haze like aura looking light about it.   upon seeing it I noticed that no noise was comeing from it and it was mearly 3ft. or so from me the whole size of the craft as far as I could determain was only about the size of a large truck tire.   the sight of it kinda made me oddly calm as if it was somehow hipnotizing me,a feeling that dissapered as soon as the craft left.  this was the singular  most odd experiance I've ever had in my whole life.;37.6414;-84.9671
