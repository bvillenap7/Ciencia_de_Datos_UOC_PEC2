Triangular object with lights on each tip that switch patterns and hover  seen on I 75 near  Corinth, KY;2004-08-29 10:35:00;2-3 minutes;Triangular object with lights on each tip that switch patterns and hover  seen on I 75 near  Corinth, KY As my girlfriend and I were traveling back to the university going North on I-75 about 3 or 4 miles from Corinth, KY, I looked up in the sky and noticed that straight ahead of me in the distance (approximately 10 miles away) there was a bright light in the sky that was going across the horizon.  The object went West across the horizonin in about 10 seconds and then stopped. After stopping, it then dropped out a dark bundle like object. Soon after that,it then turned and came towards us(South)rather quickly.  THere was no sound at all.  Then after only going about 1 mile down the road, the object it seemed was almost instantly in right front of us. The object then began to hover slowly overtop of us. WE were still driving down the road so we ended up going right under it.  THe object was triangular with one light on each point of the triangle.  There was also a red light located next to one of the lights. After the object went over top of us, I looked out of my sunroof behind me and the lights began to change into different patterns.  They began flashing and doing different shapes using red, blue, and yellowish lights.  Because we were traveling on an interstate, it was impossible for us to stop or turn around because of a median.  But as we continued driving, I wathced out of the sunroof of my Ford Explorer and noticed that it was still moving slowly over top the interstate and then up a little.;38.5305;-84.5837
