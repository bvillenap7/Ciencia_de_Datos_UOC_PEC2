At 01:11 A.M. I was working on my vehicle, I was facing toward the eastern sky when I seen a object from the corner of my eye approach from the south, south west, with a heading going toward North, North east.  The object that I seen was moving about the speed of a meteorite.    As I was about to return to working on my car I seen a second object follow and mid way threw the sky going from the same direction, the object stopped in mid flight going the same speed as the previous object and then within a split second I seen the object go back in the direction it came from with no acceleration, it just assumed its previous speed and went back the direction it came.   The object I seen flew in such a way that I have never witness any other aircraft fly before.   I was a Aviation Machinist Mate in the U.S. Navy and I worked on the F 18 E/F Super Hornets for 4 years, and with all of my service in the military around aviation and being on many different military bases, I have never seen personally any flying aircraft pull the maneuver that the object I seen tonight pull.;38.5305;-84.5837
