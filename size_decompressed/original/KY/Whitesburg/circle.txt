Just as me and a friend were trying to figure out what it was, it just seemed to change its course and shoot straight up and out of sight.  It did not have any tail such as a meteor or comet.  There was other aircraft flying around at the time we saw this.  Really makes no sense as what this could be,  No aircraft could have traveled at this speed we observed.;37.1388;-82.855
