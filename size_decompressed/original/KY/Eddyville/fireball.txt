It was a little higher than any kite I have seen and absolutely silent.  We stopped to observe. It was moving slowly.  After moving several yards toward the north it disappeared from one side of the car and instantly reappeared on the other side.  It came closer to us and hovered a moment then moved across in front of the car and proceeded slowly north.  After it went behind the trees we drove to where we knew should have been a vantage point but it was gone.      It was eerie in the fact it seemed to be looking at us.;37.0642;-88.0506
