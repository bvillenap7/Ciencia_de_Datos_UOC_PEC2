When I looked to try and see what they were looking at spotted an object in the sky. It appeared white or silver in color and circular in shape. A friend was with me and seen it too. Another man asked us if we seen the other one. If you was looking at the object and looked down slightly and to the left you could see another object which was farther out but appeared just as high in the air.  Planes were seen flying in the air which appeared to fly between the to objects. I couldn't not tell how high they were. At one point it looked like a large bird, brown in color with white tail feathers seemed to fly around the nearest object.  It looked like it was to high up for a bird to fly around.  The colors on the bird were fairly defined.  I had looked away for a moment and could no longer see the bird like object.  A man in the area said they had been there for the last hour or so.  Another man claimed he saw a third one but it had disappeared. I left the area and last saw the objects at approximately 2:03 PM.  They stayed in the same area the entire time.;37.0642;-88.0506
