Slow moving amber orb over Southeast Lyon Co., KY.;2010-09-22 00:20:00;2 minutes;Slow moving amber orb over Southeast Lyon Co., KY. Between Hwy. 93 and U.S. 62, Lyon County, Ky.:  At around 12:20 PM, 09/22/2010, my daughter and I were outside and noticed a pale amber orb crossing the sky.  It was about as high up as a Cessna (sp?) might fly, however, it made no sound, moved slow and steady, and did not flash or pulsate.  After about two minutes, it just faded out. If, perhaps, it went behind one of the few puffs of clouds, it never came out the other side. Just after it faded away, an airplane crossed its previous path at a 45-degree angle.
