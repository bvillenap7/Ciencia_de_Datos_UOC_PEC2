When we first saw the craft it was staying parallel to us on a very curvy road at a very high speed.  It would dart up in front of us and then get behind us.  I took a video on my phone to document what we were seeing.  It was flying the level of the tree line and lower the entire time never gaining altitude but darting all over the place.  It had a white flashing light and a red one.  Was the shape of a triangle.  Turned around on 18 headed back the other direction after getting freaked out and sure enough it was back parallel with us on the road headed the opposite direction.;39.0176000000001;-84.7723999999999
