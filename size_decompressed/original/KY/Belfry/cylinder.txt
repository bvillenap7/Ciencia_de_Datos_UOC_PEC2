Very large mirrored object seen in the sky for over an hour;2012-10-16 16:30:00;1 hour;Very large mirrored object seen in the sky for over an hour It was a huge mirrored object that turned  like a bird while soaring.  It would change positions back and forth.  Then it slowly started to rise into the sky, still taking different directions until it finally was so far away that it looked like the north star.  But at the same time, it would brighten and dim. I was driving on 119 South on the 4 lane heading to Belfry Middle School, my 6 year old daughter was in the back seat and asked, What is that thing in the sky?   We were around Wendy's at that time.  I watched it for a minute while driving and said &quotI need to pull over and look at this thing&quot we pulled over at Moore's, just below Food City.  By this time, it was moving upward and farther away from us.  We watched it in the sky until somewhere around the Marathon Station, just below the Middle School, where we lost sight of it because of the mountains. We dropped my older daughter off at the Middle School, headed back down the road and I told my 6 year old to change sides so she could look out the other side of the car, to see if she could find it in the sky again.  She somewhere around South Williamson she yelled, &quotThere it is again!&quot So I pulled over just before the you get to ARH and we watched it and I tried to video tape it (but it was on my phone and didn't really show up because I couldn't zoom) I lice closae by so I decided to go back home, couldn't see it there, so I decided to ride back out to ARH and watch it some more but on my way out, my neighbor was standing there with binoculars and I asked him, &quotAre you seeing the mirror in the sky?&quot We watched it there for 20-30 minutes, it finally was lost begind the clouds.;37.6393;-82.2555
