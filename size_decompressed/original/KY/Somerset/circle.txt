Round, sound-less yellow light seen moving at slow speed then disappering.;2010-07-11 23:00:00;15 seconds;Round, sound-less yellow light seen moving at slow speed then disappering. My wife and I had left her parents house around 22:30 after watching a movie. On the way home we stopped by a gas station to get some milk and fuel. After leaving the gas station, about 2 miles west of there we had came over a hill on KY HWY 80 to see a very bright yellow, circular shaped light. Now, we are very accustomed to helicopters from living close to a regional hospital and even closer to the Daniel Boone National Forest. But as we proceeded over the hill, we noticed that the light did not cast a beam, unlike a spotlight. It was also moving at a very slow speed. While we watched the object, we both stated that it was very unordinary. So we rolled down our windows to listen for the chopping of helicopter blades but there was no sound and we were the only car in sight. Then, as the object crossed the highway and was almost directly overhead, the light vanished. I will say that when I encounter some phenomenon,  I always step back and try to explain it logically and practical.  I have no explanation no matter how much I try.  With no sound and then vanishing before our eyes, we are at odds.   Thank you for your time.;37.105798839907;-84.5418747099768
