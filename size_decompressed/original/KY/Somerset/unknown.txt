Strange happening with an unknown object.;2017-06-17 03:00:00;7 minutes;Strange happening with an unknown object. I was walking home from class and I see this bright flash in the sky, and it kind of just lingered there for a few seconds.  There were cars driving by so they might have saw but I have no way of contacting them to know for sure.   Then it was like it spotted me.  Like it knew that I had saw it so it started circling me high in the air like a vulture would.   I am a professor at the college, so I have heard some of my colleagues talk about things like this.   So it circled me for a while an it mesmerized me.  Then it was like I couldn't move.  Then the next thing I know it's like I was dropped from the sky and I looked at my phone and it was roughly seven minutes later but it felt like no time at all.  I knew it had been that amount of time because I had checked my phone just before I had saw the object.   It couldn't have been an aircraft and I thought it was one of those stupid drones but I don't think it was on behalf of the sudden lapse in time that seemed to happen.;37.105798839907;-84.5418747099768
