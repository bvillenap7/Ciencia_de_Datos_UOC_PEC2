Large bright white light in Stamping Ground, Ky followed by about five smaller ones.;2012-05-30 23:00:00;5-6 minutes;Large bright white light in Stamping Ground, Ky followed by about five smaller ones. I was in bed when I noticed at about 11:00 pm that my room was very bright.  I looked out the window to see if it was the moon when I saw a very large bright white light suspended in the air.  It was so bright I had to keep looking away because it was hurting my eyes.  It was stationary and would occasionally flash its lights.   I watched it several minutes then the bright light shut off and it flew away to the left (West).   At this point about five smaller lights came from behind the tree line and followed in a line the same path the larger light took.
