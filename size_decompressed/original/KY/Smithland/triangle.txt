I noticed 5 amber light in the shape of a triangle moving from east to west.;1975-07-15 21:00:00;approx 10mins;I noticed 5 amber light in the shape of a triangle moving from east to west. In July of 1975 my wife was hospitalized in Lourdes Hospital in Paducah, Ky. While driving home after a visit I was approximately 2 miles west of Smithland,Ky traveling east on US 60.  I noticed five amber colored lights in the shape of a triangle in the eastern sky.  The lights were steady glowing and very bright.  I slowed to try to determine whether or not they were moving and found they were definately moving from east to west very slowly.  I could'nt tell if it was just one object or five separate ones until I stopped my car and got out.  It did appear to be one solid object. It also appeared to be very large.  I would estimate at least a quarter mile wide at the back part.  I continued to observe the object as I drove into the city limits of Smithland.  I then turned west on Court Street which is a dead end at the Cumberland River.  I stopped the car and continued to watch the lights until they went out of sight behind a woods on the Illinois shore.  I found out later  that similar objects had been sighted along the East coast around that same time.  I was a dispatcher for The Livingston County Sheriff's Department at the time and found that no one else had reported anything that same night. Guess I was lucky to have seen this.
