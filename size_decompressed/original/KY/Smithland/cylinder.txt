On U.S. 60 approx 4 miles east of Smithland,KY, I noticed a very bright object in the sky. The sky was clear and the sun was obviously reflecting on the object.  I stopped on the road and continued to watch the object as it appeared to turn to one side.   I could see that it was a long object like an airplane fuselage, but without  wings or a tail. There was no contrail or signs of any type of exhaust. It wasn't moving forward or backward, but just sort of hung there.  It appeared to be no more than a mile from my location and probably no more than 4 or 5 thousand ft. above a tall bluff.  I lowered the car window to be sure that I wasn't seeing a reflection off the glass.  I watched it for a couple of minutes and pulled to the shoulder due to traffic.  When I looked back the object was no where in sight.  Even a fast jet could not have gone out of my range of sight in that short time.  I am very familiar with the aircraft in our area since we live about 80 miles from Ft. Campbell,KY and I have never seen anything like this before.;37.2044333333333;-88.3851666666667
