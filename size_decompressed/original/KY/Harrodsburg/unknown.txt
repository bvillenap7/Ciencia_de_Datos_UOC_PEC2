Iron-gridwork, lightless, silent UFO seen over central Kentucky.;1997-10-15 20:15:00;45 seconds;Iron-gridwork, lightless, silent UFO seen over central Kentucky. I had just returned home from visiting a friend. Stepping out of my vehicle, I crossed our blacktop driveway towards the garage of our house, looking up at the clear night sky. What I saw caused a heart-racing thrill: Totally silent, a large, dark craft in the shape of a grid-like array (grid reminded me of iron pipework) was floating slowly toward the north over our house. It was low in the sky, about 800 feet up in the air, silent as I said, and in motion, as if it was carried on a breeze. It had no lights. I only estimated its shape by the pattern it took in blocking out starlight above it. I watched it for about thirty seconds, then got scared and went in the house.  Later that night, the regional news from Lexington reported a UFO sighting. But that one was video-captured a dotted light in the sky. Not what I saw.

Unknown lights.;2011-10-11 23:23:00;8 min;Unknown lights. This video was shot using a cell phone.  The orange light is a street light.  The White light is the one that we are talking about.  The guy said it is a meteor.  However the flight path started out to our right, then it made a 90 degree right turn and started to head away from us.    Also you will notice a few flashes of green light above the white light.   This green light flash was not visible to our naked eyes. Please let me know what you find out with this video.

Lights appear in the night sky during very strange and loud sound resonating in the distance.;2015-04-05 02:00:00;~1 minute filmed;Lights appear in the night sky during very strange and loud sound resonating in the distance. My mother had a strange encounter on 05APR2015, at 2AM Eastern Time, in Harrodsburg, KY.  She heard a strange sound that was so loud she went outside onto her back porch to investigate further, and the video she took of it did the volume of the sound no justice. 	Upon walking outside with her phone in hand, she immediately saw a UFO in the distance, then started to record.  When you watch the video, look closely to the left of the building. This building has lights around it, but the UFO is obvious after you study the video a bit.  You will see a light in the night sky moving erratically and can easily come to the conclusion that this UFO isn’t any known aircraft.  Soon after capturing the UFO on camera, it takes off.  The acceleration alone is astonishing.  After it takes off you will see two bright lights appear over the building in the distance, so keep your eye over the building when my mother tries to follow the first UFO.  This may possibly be military trying to follow the UFO.  They sort of fade in and out so I'm not certain it is man made aircraft, and right before she’s done filming, the original UFO caught on camera, enters back the frame close to it’s original location at about 43 seconds into the minute video. 	Also, all the while she is filming this sighting, you hear the odd horn type noise in the background.  She checked the next day with local officials, and there was no kind of emergency alarms or any other testing of alarm systems in the area.  Also it was a clear night with no storm systems in the area. 	I would much like to hear your opinion on the matter. I myself don’t fall into the category of being a believer of extraterrestrial life per say, though I am skeptical and even more so now.  The reason I wanted your opinion on the matter is because clearly you are more educated on UFO sightings.  Not only am I interested in the lights in the sky, but also the noise in the background.  If you look into this, if you already haven’t, you can find numerous video’s from around the world hearing that eerie sound in the footage.  Check them out and also my mother's video posted on YouTube here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5gdG06iXbE  Keep in mind, I noticed if I viewed the video on my computer, the UFO that moves back and forth seems very blurry.  It may be due to the quality of the monitor on my PC.  However, when viewing the video on my Galaxy S6 Edge, the UFO on the film is very crisp and no blur at all.;37.8032999999999;-84.8606999999999
