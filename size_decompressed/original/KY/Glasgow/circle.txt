UFOs between Glasgow KY and Bowling Green KY;2020-08-04 05:15:00;10 minutes;UFOs between Glasgow KY and Bowling Green KY Event occurred on the Louis B Nunn Cumberland Parkway between Glasgow KY and Bowling Green KY.  Time of the event was between 5am and 5:15 am.  I was driving west on the Cumberland Parkway towards I-65.  Just past the last Glasgow KY exit I saw what appeared to be the woods on fire, everything was red up ahead and into the woods, a minute or two after seeing the red from the sky to the ground I observed several round silver disk shaped objects with six white lights on the bottom of the craft.  The first one I observed was approximately 400 to 500 ft in the air and there were similar craft on both sides of the road.  As I continued driving, I saw multiple similar craft all over the sky.  They appeared to be stationary and I would say there was 8 to 10 of them.  Several miles down the road right around the I-65 south exit from the Cumberland Parkway, I observed many more of the same type craft but higher up in the air, maybe another 6 -8 craft.  There were sev! eral other cars in the area and a motorcycle right behind me.   I would really be interested if anyone else reported this sighting.;36.9904;-85.9238999999998
