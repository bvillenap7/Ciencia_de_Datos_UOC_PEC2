MY WIFE NOTICED IT FIRST SINCE I WAS DRIVING.  IT WAS A CLEAR NIGHT AND THE ROAD WAS NOT LIGHTED WHERE WE WERE.  WE WERE COMING UP A GRADE IN THE ROAD THROUGH A ROCK CUT.  WE WERE ALSO NEARING THE LOCAL AIRPORT.THE CRAFT CROSSED OUR PATH IN A NORTHERLY DIRECTION.  AS MY WIFE POINTED IT OUT I AT FIRST THOUGHT IT WAS AN AIPRLANE. WE COULD NOT ACERTAIN THE SHAPE OF IT.  THERE WAS A DULL WHITE LIGHT ON THE NORTH END OF IT. THERE WERE THREE RECTANGULAR WHITE LIGHTS IN A ROW, THEN A RED LIGHT. AT THE END THERE WAS A SPARKLING LIGHT. MY WIFE DESCRIBED IT AS LOOKING LIKE A SPARKLER.  WE WERE IN FRONT OF THE AIRPORT IN APPROXIMATELY 30 SECONDS AFTER IT DISAPPEARED. WE STOPPED AND LOOKED FOR SIGNS OF AN AIRPLANE. THERE WERE NO PLANES IN SIGHT.  WE ARE BOTH INTELLIGENT SANE PEOPLE.  WE ARE ALSO BOTH CHRISTIANS.  WE HAVE BEEN MARRIED FOR 22 YEARS, AND HAVE THREE CHILDREN.;36.9904;-85.9238999999998
