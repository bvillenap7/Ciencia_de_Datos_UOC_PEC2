Triangle shaped craft with 5 white lights at the Cumberland Parkway tollbooth in Barren County, Ky. on 04-21-01 @ 08:00 p.m.;2001-04-21 20:00:00;7 minutes;Triangle shaped craft with 5 white lights at the Cumberland Parkway tollbooth in Barren County, Ky. on 04-21-01 @ 08:00 p.m. Driving back from Bowling Green East towards Glasgow on the Cumberland Parkway I noticed a series of 5 bright white lights shaped like a triangle moving slowly from the northwest at an altitude of about 75 degrees heading in a southeast direction. I was about 5 miles from the toll booth and it took about 5 minutes for the object to intersect my truck at the zenith (toll both). I paid my toll, went down about 1/2 mile and pulled off to the shoulder of the road. It was very, very low and the far left light had a single red strobe. My wife got out and we measured this object with our outstretched arms. It was very huge and covered the distance of about 5 normal sized human hands. Almost like looking at a 747 a couple of hundred feet above the tarmac at an airport. This object made no engine noise. No turbines, no prop, no nothing. To be honest, I was completely amazed at the lack of engine noise. This object was triangle-shaped. Similar to a boomarang but with well-defined sharp corners. We stood there about 2 minutes as it slowly drifted a couple more degrees southest and while still directly above us accelerating and gaining altitude rapidly past the horizon in about 15 seconds. By the time we were able to get the camera and snap a picture it was too far away to get anything of use on the film. Needless to say, I was disappointed. The city of Louisville had its annual Thunder over Louisville that same night so this event may be related to the airshow. But I never saw any aircraft that low that didn't make an engine thrust sound or traverse 90 degrees of sky in 15 seconds. If anyone saw the same object, I wish they would post it here so as to compare notes or confirm that it wasn't an illusion.;36.9904;-85.9238999999998
Early summer evening.  While riding my bike, I noticed three green lights at about cloud level in a triangle. ((anonymous report));2005-06-01 20:00:00;~5 seconds;Took place in early summer in the evening.   While riding my bike, I noticed three green lights at about cloud level in a triangular formation overhead.  They soon shifted slightly then shot off at an upward angle until out of sight.   Not sure if this was one triangular craft or three smaller crafts in triangular formation. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of the report elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
