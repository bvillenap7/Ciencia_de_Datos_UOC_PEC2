Orangeish red lights almost like firelanterns.;2012-06-29 21:30:00;1 minute;Orangeish red lights almost like fire lanterns. My Boyfriend, our friend, and I saw 3 orange-ish red lights flowing same speed, same direction.   I looked up sightings only thing I found was the phenix lights in arazona.   I pointed out what I thought to be a planet, but soon as I got a clear eye view looking at these lights I saw the same size light follow the first light.   A few moments later one more light came by going the same speed same direction.  Making a train engine sound.   We all 3 were shocked but enjoyed the lights, and acually useing our minds for a great amount of time.  I was scared because never saw anything like it before.    Maybe it will be better explained in the near future. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, who corrected the date of the sighting.  The correct date was June 29th, which we indicate above.  PD));36.9904;-85.9238999999998
