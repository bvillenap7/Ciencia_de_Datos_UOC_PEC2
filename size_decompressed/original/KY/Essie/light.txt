Bright light, with no noise, traveling over Essie, Kentucky (Southeastern Ky);2017-08-10 22:30:00;1 minute;Bright light with no noise traveling over Essie, Kentucky (Southeastern Ky) My husband and I were outside with our dogs.  I looked up and there was a light moving through the sky, no blinking lights just a solid light.  It made no noise.   I joked with my husband about it being a UFO, and blinked my flashlight in its direction a couple of times, and it just disappeared.;37.0547;-83.4561
