Purple/Pinkish Orb in the Sky.;2019-04-06 20:40:00;10 seconds;Purple/Pinkish Orb in the Sky. 	This event just happened to me (@8:38 p.m.).  I wanted to tell it as soon as possible, while it was still fresh in my mind. I was outside cleaning up my yard after mowing and filling my bird feeders, when I just so happened to look up to the west and see a large orb/light in the sky.  I wasn’t expecting to see that and it startled me.  It was pretty close to me, I would say approximately 100 yards away.  At that distance, it looked like the size of my street light.   The color was what really freaked me out.  It was purple and pinkish in color, and it also seemed to emit some kind of clear light.   I watched it for about 15 seconds.  It moved really slow in my direction then, all of the sudden it just disappeared.  No streak in the sky, no going behind a cloud, nothing.   At first, I tried to rationalize it by thinking it may be my neighbor who flies drones, but it really didn’t look like one and the way it disappeared leads me to think it wasn’t that.  I am going to contact him to see if he was flying it at this time, and will make an update to my report as to what he tells me.;37.0547;-83.4561
