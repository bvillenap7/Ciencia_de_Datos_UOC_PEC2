Something bright caught my eye above the right of me and at first I thought it was the street lights then I realized it was moving around in circles then it flew up and went behind a cloud u could still see it moving in and out the clouds very fast then slower.  Then it would get close to the street light across the street!  Then shoot back super fast!  There was no sound at all!  Super wired never seen nothing like it!
