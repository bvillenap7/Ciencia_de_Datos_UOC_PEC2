shiny metallic diamond shaped stationary object high in the sky for approx. 20 minutes daytime;2015-07-18 17:00:00;20 minutes;shiny metallic diamond shaped stationary object high in the sky for approx. 20 minutes daytime My 2 teenagers and I were outside in a rural area, on a sunny day with no cloud cover.  We all saw a VERY BRIGHT reflective silver diamond shape just appear in the sky to our north west at a distance.  It was free floating at quite a height and must have been very large close up.   It stayed there for approximately 20 minutes, and then simply disappeared.  It actually scared me, never have seen anything like that.   I am ex Air Force and know what a plane in motion looks like.  This was nothing like a military plane. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));38.3955;-84.2906
