I was getting a glass of water at the kitchen sink when I saw a bright star in the sky thru my window.I watched it as I drank my water,then I saw a red light suddenly come from the bottom of the item,a quick burst of red light.I grabbed my digital camera and went out on my deck.I listened for a sound of a helicopter or a plane but there were no sounds coming from it.I took several pictures. It was in the western sky,up above the tree line.When I downloaded them to my computer,I was surprised at what is in the pictures.;37.5783;-84.2740999999999
