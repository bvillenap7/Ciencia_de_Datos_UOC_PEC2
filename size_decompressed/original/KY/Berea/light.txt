Bright, white vanishing light spotted in rural Berea, Kentucky.;2009-10-23 18:30:00;1 minute, 30 seconds (est;Bright, white vanishing light spotted in rural Berea, Kentucky. On Friday October 23rd, 2009 around 6:00 to 6:30 p.m. sometime far before the sun had started to set and dusk started to settle in, I observed a strange white light in the Eastern sky that seemed to be located somewhere in between Smith Lane and the end of Blue Lick Road in the rural Bobtown/Kingston area in Berea, Kentucky.  It looked just like a bright, white star in the daylight, moving quite slowly. I observed this peculiar anomaly for about a minute and a half before it finally vanished behind a distant tree line.  It did not reappear after vanishing into the treeline.;37.5783;-84.2740999999999
Red and green light hovering over Berea.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible star?  Sirius??  PD));2017-12-20 22:14:00;30 minutes+;Red and green light hovering over Berea. At approximately 9:14 pm, my boyfriend, mom and myself observed a singular light in the sky.  I went inside for my binoculars and viewed the object.  To my surprise I saw a red and green light.  When we first saw the object it was flying at about the height of what a helicopter would and then after about 30 min we realized it was slowly rising to about the height of what an airplane would fly at.  Then we just went back inside.;37.5783;-84.2740999999999
Star gazing one night then seen a light that I thought at first glance was a plane but the object was zig zagging really fast all over;2020-08-11 02:00:00;30 minutes;Star gazing one night then seen a light that I thought at first glance was a plane but the object was zig zagging really fast all over the area where I was looking.  Done this for at least 30 minutes and literally disappeared.  I had a video but it accidentally got deleted but I have a pic of what I think is it.;37.5783;-84.2740999999999
