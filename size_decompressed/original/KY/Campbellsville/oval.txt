As we were standing there talking we noticed this object in the sky about treetop level and the size of a football field or bigger.  We were only about 500 yards from it and it swept across the sky without much of a sound, only a slight sound like the wind.    It was moving slow and we got a real good look at it and could see windows and in one window could see a human like figure looking out.   We were very surprised and ask each other if we all saw it and we all agreed on what we saw.It moved off to the north and we continued on or trip amazed at what we had seen.
