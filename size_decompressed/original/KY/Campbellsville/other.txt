Three spheres in shape of triangle going slow at first then going extremely fast and disappearing.;2011-06-17 20:00:00;About 30 seconds;Three spheres in shape of triangle going slow at first then going extremely fast and disappearing. I was fishing with a family member at green river lake state park.  I looked up to the dark night sky and noticed three white looking spheres in the shape of a triangle moving at relatively slow speeds.  They then began flying at very high speeds remaining in the triangular shape until I lost a visual on them. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
