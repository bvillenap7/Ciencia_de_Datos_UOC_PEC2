A lot of students reported hearing this loud sound and many were outside of their dorms to check it out.  When I got other students to compare what they heard to other similar occurrences (strange noises in the sky on YouTube) they all concurred that the noises were very similar.  I know events like this aren't directly linked to UFO activity but I thought it needed to be reported.;37.3441;-85.3497
