Soundless Aircraft rises from tree line and flies away;2012-09-18 21:30:00;1 hour or more;Soundless Aircraft rises from tree line and flies away I watched lights in the sky with binoculars for several hours last night. Several motionless low hanging lights would flicker red and green, and for a little while they were on the ground. Across the field, in the tree line, a flickering light. Then blinking white light, slowly rising from the trees. Once it reached a certain altitude, the whit light turned off and then there was a red and green light that came on and stayed on and then it slowly and noiselessly drifted over my house and off towards the North. After seeing this, I went inside and asked my mother if she would come look at this. We witnessed two more of the same thing.  These were  soundless craft of some sort.  It was technology that followed a certain protocol, because all in all three instances the craft followed the same procedure, only two went north and one went west.  It seemed like every dog in the area was barking last night and the Amish were out late and there was this constant sound of scraping metal. We did try and get video, but it's so crappy that it's not worth posting.  They've been out here every night for over a week, but usually they are just stationary and then disappear. Last night was the most movement. I was anticipating contact, they were so close.;36.7614;-86.1929
