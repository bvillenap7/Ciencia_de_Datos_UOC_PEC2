When I walked out on deck I heard the hum even louder looked up and it was hovering over my home maybe 500 feet in air diamond shaped dull silver colored craft with 6 rolls ((sic.  rows)) of lights in the arrow shape.  One roll red one roll white light co-ordinating back and forth flashing.  It also had 2 smaller crafts one on each side hovering for at least 5 minutes or a little more.  I was not the only one to see this.  I had neighbors 3 miles down the road that saw them as well.  I would be willing to take a lie detectors test.;37.43;-86.2104
