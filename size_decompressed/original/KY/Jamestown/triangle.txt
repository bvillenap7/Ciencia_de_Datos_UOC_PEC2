Ufo over lake cumberland.;2008-04-23 11:09:00;8 min;Ufo over lake cumberland. My Wife and I saw a Triangle shape ufo. it had a cupple of lights, I think three. It was over lake cumberland coming towards Clifty Creek Rd. which is in Russell County just south of Jamestown, Ky. I was at the new water tower off clifty creek which is the hihest point in Russell County. The Ufo just hoovered and moved at times toward town then hoovered again and then vanished. This is the first time i've every seen anythinglike that here in my 17 years. Not sure if the lights were a beam or not, however there was a small twin plain which did fly over about 20 min. prior. Poss. landing at Jamestown Airport. Hope this helps.;36.9687;-85.0919
