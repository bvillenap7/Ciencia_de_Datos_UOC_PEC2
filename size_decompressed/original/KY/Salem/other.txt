Not a UFO, but a strange black helicopter.;2006-02-13 15:00:00;10min;Not a UFO, but a strange black helicopter. I realize that this is not actually a UFO sighting report, but I felt it was strange enough to report to someone anyway.  On the afternoon of Feb. 12 at approximately 1500 hrs, my cousin and I were standing on the driveway at his farm when we heard a loud swishing sound from across the valley from his farm.  The farm is at a rather high elevation and we had a clear line of sight for several miles to the Southwest across US Highway 60.  The sound became louder and we saw literally thousands of birds flying across the highway from my uncle's farm.  They appeared to have been startled by something.   A minute later we then heard a helicopter coming from the opposite direction.  When the copter came into sight we noticed that it was a flat black in color and had dark tinted windows.  I got my binoculars from my truck and got a closer look. The aircraft had absolutely no marking anywhere on it.  It flew to the Southwest to almost exactly where the birds had come from and began hovering not more than 75 to 100 feet above the field on my Uncle's farm.  The craft continued to hover for several minutes and I watched it the entire time.  There were no marking at all and all of the front bubble glass appeared to be tinted very dark.  I was unable to see anyone inside and it was close enough that I should have been able to see the pilot clearly.  If anyone else has had any type of contact with a black chopper like this, I would like to know who these people are and if the birds and the chopper are related incidents or just coincidence.
