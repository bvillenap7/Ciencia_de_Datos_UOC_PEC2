I was burning a brush pile and happened to see two lights spaced perhaps as lights would be on a long craft of some sort. The lights floated across the sky without making any sound at all. The craft was flying lower than the aircraft in the area. The lack of noise was very curious indeed. I watched it go out of sight.
