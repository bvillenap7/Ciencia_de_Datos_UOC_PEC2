UFO's Appear in Clear Night Sky Near City of South Shore in Greenup County Kentucky;2007-01-10 23:00:00;10 minutes;UFO's Appear in Clear Night Sky Near City of South Shore in Greenup County Kentucky At approxmately 11pm on Wednesday January 10th, 2006 I was looking out the back window of my home, located off Dryfork Road near the city of South Shore in Greenup County, Kentucky, when I saw two solid bright lights about a quarter mile away and about 500 feet above the ground.  The lights where not moving so I became very curious and went outside for a better look and to listen for any sounds which I did not hear.   At this point I went back in my house and called for my wife and nephew to come and see this amazing sight out the back window.  We all three then looked out the back window but only one light was visible at this point so we all three decided to go outside for a better view.   Once outside we could still only see one light which had remained in the same spot since I first saw it and which was still not making any sound.    We continued to watch the light for another couple of minutes when it began moving northward and then shot off instantaneously out of sight just like you see UFO's do in movies.   I have never seen anything like it in my life and I am certain it was no currently known man made flying technology.;38.7128;-82.9373
