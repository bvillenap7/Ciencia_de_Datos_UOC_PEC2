UFO over South Shore;2006-04-28 18:00:00;5 min;UFO over South Shore I was at the family reunion the other day when my brother started to scream. We looked up at the sunny sky and saw a cigar shape craft coming in from the NW towards Portsmouth, Oh. It slowed down as it passed us. It was errie as it seemed to be observing us. My aunt was so shocked to see such a craft that she passed out. We then noticed two jets, I dont know if they were fighter jets, chasing the craft as it headed towards Grayson, Ky This was a really strange experience for me. The sighting was in the Daily Times and we reported it to the South Shore PD but they never got back with us.;38.7128;-82.9373
