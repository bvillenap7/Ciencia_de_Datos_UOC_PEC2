Oval, with red and orange pulsating lights.;2001-02-04 17:00:00;2 min.;Oval, with red and orange pulsating lights. It was getting dark and I was just getting home. I pulled in my driveway and for some reason I looked at the sky above the treee tops. There I saw a bright light. It was oval shaped and in sections all the way around it, it was glowing red and orange lights. The lights were pulsating and the aircraft apeared to be spinning. At the same time it was swaying from side to side. I ran into the house to get some binoculars and when I came back outside it was gone. I stayed outside til I was frost-bit and never saw it again.;37.1152;-85.2705
Mysterious Hovering Object beside Louie B. Nunn Parkway;2007-02-23 19:45:00;uknown;Mysterious Hovering Object beside Louie B. Nunn Parkway My family and I were coming back from dinner that night.  We were driving two seperate vehicles on our way back down the Louie B. Nunn (formerly the Cumberland) Parkway.   Around the Gradyville area we spotted an unidentified flying object hovering to the left side of the parkway.  The lights were blue, red and green.  It was an oval shaped object and it never moved...we slowed down, but did not stop as it was kind of scary.  There had to be numerous eye witnesses to this event as traffic was heavy on the parkway that night.  My husband who has never believed in UFO's asked me to post to this site so we could see if anyone else may/may not come forward about the sighting of this object.;37.1152;-85.2705
