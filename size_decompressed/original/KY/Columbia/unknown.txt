I IMMEDIATLY NOTICE AN EXTREMELY BRIGHT LIGHT COMING THROUGH MY WINDOW,;2000-01-17 04:30:00;10 minutes;IT WAS AROUND 4:30 IN THE MORNING AND I WAS AWAKENED INSTANTLY. I IMMEDIATLY NOTICE AN EXTREMELY BRIGHT LIGHT COMING THROUGH MY WINDOW, IT WAS RED, GREEN, BUT MOSTLY WHITE, IT WOULD HURT YOUR EYES TO LOOK AT IT. THERE WAS THIS PULSATING SOUND REPEATEDLY GOING, IT WOULD HURT YOUR EARS. AS I LOOKED AT THE WINDOW FOR THE FIRST TIME LYING IN MY BED I SEEN THE SHADOW OR OUTLINE OF AN OBJECT APPEARING TO BE THE SIZE OF A LITTLE BOY, THEN INSTANTLY IT WAS GONE. I WAS SO SCARED I PULLED THE COVERS OVER MY HEAD AND STARTED PRAYING. I COULDNT MOVE FROM FEAR. EVERY NIGHT AS I GO TO SLEEP I TURN ON THE RADIO TO LISTEN TO ART BELL, AND EVERY SO OFTEN I WILL ACCIDENTLY LEAVE MY CLOSET LIGHT ON. YOU CAN SEE THE LIGHT PEERING THROUGH THE DOOR. AS THIS WHATEVER WAS GOING ON I NOTICED THAT MY RADIO AND MY CLOSET LIGHT WERE OFF. WHATEVER THIS WAS SOUNDED LIKE IT WAS RIGHT OVER OUR HOUSE OR IN OUR BACKYARD. AFTER ABOUT TEN MINUTES PASSED THE SOUNDS AND LIGHTS INSTANTLY STOPPED AND MY RADIO AND CLOSET LIGHT CAME BACK ON. I NEVER ACTUALLY GOT OUT OF BED BUT I COULD SEE OUT MY WINDOW AND I DIDNT ACTUALLY SEE ANYTHING. TONIGHT I AM GOING TO TRY AND STAY UP AND CATCH SOMETHING ON FILM.THE PRIOR NIGHT MY MOTHER WAS AWAKEN BY THE SAME THING, SO THIS IS TWO NIGHTS IN A ROW. SOMEWHERE AROUND 3 WEEKS AGO A GENTLEMAN THAT LIVES ABOUT TEN MILES DOWN THE ROAD WAS OUT ON HIS BACK PORCH AROUND 8 P.M AND NOTICED THESE BRIGHT LIGHTS OFF IN HIS FIELD HE ALSO SAID IT LOOKED LIKE THERE WERE FLAMES COMING FROM UNDERNEATH IT LOOKED ALMOST CYLINDER LIKE HE IMMEDIATLY RAN INSIDE AND CALLED THE POLICE AND LOCAL FIRE DEPT. BUT NO ONE RESPONDED SO HE WENT BACK IN AND CALLED AGAIN,FINALLY AFTER THREE PHONE CALLS THEY ARRIVED BUT WHATEVER WAS OUT THERE HAD ALREADY DISSAPPEARED. THE NEXT MORNING AT THE LOCAL COUNTRY STORE HE GOT TO TELLING THE STORY, EVERYONE WAS MAKING FUN OF HIM UNTIL ANOTHER GUY CONFESSED TO SEEING THE SAME THING,HE HADNT SAID OR CALLED ANYONE BECAUSE HE THOUGHT EVERYONE WOULD THINK HE WAS CRAZY. HE TOLD THE STORY OF THE SAME THING! , HE THO UGHT THAT A CATTLE TRAILER OR SEMI TRUCK HAD RUN OFF THE ROAD IN HIS FIELD SO HE TOLD HIS WIFE THAT HE WOULD GO TAKE A LOOK. HIS WIFE SEEING THE SAME THING KEPT WATCHING AS HER HUSBAND WENT TO PUT HIS SHOES ON, AS HE WAS PUTING HIS SHOES ON SHE YELLED BACK TO HIM IF YOUR GOING OUT THERE YOU BETTER HURRY BECAUSE THAT CATTLE TRAILER JUST FLEW OFF THERE IS ALSO A RUMOR THAT A LARGE METEOR FELL IN THE SAME AREA AROUND THIS TIME AND THAT SOME PEOPLE CAME DOWN FROM OUR CAPITOL FRANKFORT AND TOOK IT. THIS IS JUST A BRIEF SUMMARY THAT I THINK NEEDS TO BE LOOKED INTO BECAUSE WHO KNOWS HOW MANY OTHER PEOPLE ARE SEEING THE SAME THING AROUND HERE BUT NOT SAYING ANYTHING.THANKS FOR TAKING THE TIME TO READ THIS.;37.1152;-85.2705
