Sitting on my back porch.  Beautiful clear evennng.  Noticed an bright, constant, orange light.  Consistent speed. ((anonymous report));2017-07-08 22:30:00;1 minute;Sitting on my back porch.  Beautiful clear evennng.   Noticed an bright, constant, orange light.  Moving at a consistent speed a few thousand feet up going North to South.  Maybe 150-200 mph.   Light was the same brightness throughout.  Straight flight path, very low with no sound at all.   Novice opinion:  too fast to be a lantern, flew too many miles to be a consumer drone.  Will watch again tonight. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of the report elects to remain anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));38.0405;-84.7293000000004
