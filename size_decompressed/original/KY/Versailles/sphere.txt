Me and 2 of my friends had decided to build a bonfire earlier at around 7:50 P.M. At 12:40 we heard a noise like rustling leaves that got louder and louder. We looked to the southwest and in the sky was an sphere-like object that was descending at about 25 M.P.H. onto a pasture. An orb of flourescent purple light was rotating around the object inside what seemed to be a kind of tube. As the object slowed down, so did the speed at which the purple orb revolved around the craft. After it had sat there for a couple minutes, another sphere shaped craft came down and landed next to the other. The second craft made the same noise as the first. They seemed to be docking with one another. At about 5 minutes they both made the rustling noise again. They did that for about 45 seconds, and then they flew off into the air much faster than they had landed. We checked out the spots where they had landed the next morning. Under where the craft had landed, much of the grass was now dry and brown. ((NUFORC Note:  Probable hoax.  PD));38.0405;-84.7293000000004
Three reddish orbs, triangle formation, stationary, Woodford County, Ky July 4, 2017.  ((anonymous report));2017-07-04 22:00:00;5 minutes;Three reddish orbs, triangle formation, stationary, Woodford County, Ky July 4, 2017. Three bright reddish orbs in a triangular formation, stationary in the sky.  The sky was clear. Stars around the orbs much smaller.   Within a 5-8 minute period, the orbs began to fade, one at a time.   I'm sure many people saw the orbs because it was July 4 and it was within 10 miles of the airport.   I've lived here for 22 years and I sincerely don't believe it was an air craft.   I will send a photo of the last orb before it faded.   I don't want to be contacted. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information, and requests that no one contact her about the sighting.  Hence, all we can do is hope that she sends a copy of the photo.
