Object with three unterrestrially bright white lights;2019-01-21 23:45:00;5 minutes;Object with three unterrestrially bright white lights Spotted while driving east along Tyrone Pike in Woodford County.  Craft had three bright lights, much brighter than any commercial or known military craft, and one flashing red light.  It was gliding east in what looked like the vicinity of Bluegrass Parkway.  Possibly following the Parkway or heading toward LEX airport, but I was a few miles away so it was difficult to tell.   Craft then flew counter clockwise in a circle roughly near the Versailles exit of the Parkway, before continuing east.  It did not appear to bank during its turn.  The sky was overcast but the craft was well below the cloudline, and due to the brightness of its lights it was very noticeable.  Also due to the brightness of its lights I could not see the craft itself, only the lights.   I understand itâ€™s very probable this was a terrestrial craft, but I have not been able to determine what it was.;38.0405;-84.7293000000004
