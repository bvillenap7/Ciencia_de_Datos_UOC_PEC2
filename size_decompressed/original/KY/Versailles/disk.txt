Hovering object over trees that disappeared with video evidence that was gone next day;2011-06-30 03:00:00;15:00;Hovering object over trees that disappeared with video evidence that was gone next day Me and some friends were having a fire that lasted until 1 am when we decided to put it out. Around 230 am I looked out the kitchen window and the fire was blazing hot, I had my older sister put it out at that point. The fire did not reblaze. Around 3 am me and my 2 friends decided to go outside on the front porch and smoke a cigarette. As we were smoking I was looking towards the tree line on the other side of the road and saw something very unusual. There was a very large spherical craft floating right above the tree line. As I kept looking i alerted the other group members and we all were in awe as we watched it hover across the road into the neighbors field about 50 ft. From the house. This object was hovering approximately 100 ft off the ground and did not have any sound coming from it, it was very close to us. We watched this hover in one spot for 10 minutes. The craft started to ascend upward and then within a blink of an eye it disappeared, there wer! e no lights on the craft. We could see the whole thing because it was a full moon that night. The thing that bothers me the most, i recorded the whole encounter on my phone from start to finish. When it disappeared into the night, I reviewed the footage and it was heavily distorted. The next morning when I woke up the video was gone and could not be recovered.;38.0405;-84.7293000000004
