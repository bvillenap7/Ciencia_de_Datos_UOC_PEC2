Upon reviewing image, I noticed an unknown object that I had not seen when taking the picture. I am a professional person in my thirties and I had borrowed our Sony digital camera from work.  It just so happens that it rained that day at home and the sun came out.  There was such a brilliant rainbow, I decided to take a picture of it.  I took four pictures of the rainbow. Two were both time-stamped 5:55 p.m.  However, in the first, there is this definite object and the second there is none.  It is somewhat fuzzy, but even so, it still looks like your standard UFO you see in films and on TV. I have Photshop on my computer and so I saved a copy on my hard drive and tried to isolate the image.  It is definitely something.  Upon isolating the area around the photo, I see beneath the object in the picture another object triangular in shape.  It appears as if the disc shaped object has what appear to be rays coming down and falling upon the triangular shaped object.  Very strange, especially since I did not see any of this when I took the photo and also because these objects do not appear in the photo that I took not more than ten seconds later.;37.8564;-83.9319
