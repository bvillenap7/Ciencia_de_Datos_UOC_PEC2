Triangle or boomerang shape darted up into the sky and stopped.  Had lights but the bottom you could see but not lights on the bottom.  looked like it was sitting still but could see short erratic movements then we thought we saw a couple more during the hour we watched but not sure about those.  I did video and take photos. could have been a V shape. I don't know what I saw it moved not real fast but it did go faster up into the sky and stopped and stayed there for at least an hour and we stopped watching. I do have a video and some photos if you want to see them or you want to contact me.  I really don't know what we saw but it was weird .;37.8564;-83.9319
I recorded an event of white blinking lights in the shape of a triangle.;2018-12-26 21:20:00;1:29;I recorded an event of white blinking lights in the shape of a triangle. My dog started growling and barking at the front door and my TV screen of the outside camera.  When I looked at the camera screen, I seen blinking lights appearing in the shape of a triangle (sides only), I grabbed my phone and started recording it.  My heart was thumping so fast and hard.  I had such a scared feeling inside me.  When it was over I tried to watch my recording but it was black and some strange noises was coming from my phone.  I was able to use playback and got the recording and have it on my phone.  The lights came toward the house then backed up and began to burned out.  I thought it was ghost but my kids are convinced it was a UFO sighting.;37.8564;-83.9319
