Hovering sphere with flashing lights seen over a farm in Powell County, Kentucky.;1979-08-19 22:50:00;1 minute;Hovering sphere with flashing lights seen over a farm in Powell County, Kentucky. In the summer of 1979, when I was 21 years old, my former husband and I were attending a party on a farm in Powell County, Kentucky.  We had gone up to the house to use the restroom and were on our way back toward the stage, where the crowd was listening to Bluegrass music, when something caught my eye. My husband was a bit tipsy, having had several beers, but I wasn’t, because I didn’t drink. When I looked up into the clear night sky, I was astonished to see a huge round object hovering over the field at about 2500 to 3000 feet above.  The sphere had multi-colored flashing lights going around its perimeter of green, yellow, white, and red and was making a very faint whirring sound. I believe the lights were moving counter clockwise, but it has been so long that I am not sure of that. I got my husband’s attention and had him to look at it, too. He sobered up pretty quickly! The object hovered a few more seconds (approximately 15) and just as if it had seen us see it, it darted amazingly quickly away in a zigzag pattern in a due east direction.  Within 2 or 3 seconds, the object had completely disappeared with no trace. (I grew up the oldest daughter of a career Marine that taught Avionics. I had been to many Blue Angel Shows, grew up around aviation, flight simulators, etc., and I had never seen or heard of anything that could move that fast.)  As far as I know, we were the only ones to witness the object. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of the event may be approximate.  PD));37.8564;-83.9319
