An unidentified object;2005-03-03 16:57:00;minute or less;An unidentified object I was driving along and not sure as I know satellites can be seen at night passing along the sky but I've never witnessed one during daylight and at the altitude this was flying at.   It was not an airplane, it was just a light, moving faster than a plane and was not shaped like a helicopter.  By the time I got to an area where I would have been better able to see it, it was gone.   It may have had more shape than I could catch but the light distracted any other formation. It was not a blinding light but it caught more of my attention than anything else.  I really don't know what it was. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

four fuzzy light chasing each other in a circle.  angels?;2005-12-02 19:00:00;10 minutes;four fuzzy light chasing each other in a circle.  angels? there were four fuzzy lights in the sky.  almost looked like huge spotlights, but with no beams up to them.  they were going around in a big circle as if they were chasing each other.  my brother and i were going to church to work on some things.  we saw these lights in the sky onthe highway and the closer we got to church the closer we got to them.  they were almost right over top of the church when we got there (about 10 minutes after first seeing them).  i don't believe in ufo's.  if i had to say-they were angels.  the whole time they were just going around and around in circles.  no pattern at all though.  definitely nothing i've ever seen before in my life.  amazing.;36.6089000000001;-88.3030999999997
