oval object shoots across the sky and explodes in bright flash.;2008-08-08 01:30:00;about 6 seconds;oval object shoots across the sky and explodes in bright flash. My step-brother, his friend, and I were walking down the road. The event occurred between 1:30 to 1:45. First we were just walking we were about 200 yards away from the house.  And we all saw a flash of light and, then there was an oval shaped object that shot across the sky with a hissing noise.  It left a bright trail that remained even after it was gone.  But after it shot across the sky it had seemed to explode in a sudden silent flash.  Afterwards i tried to contact somebody about this, I had contacted 411 to see if they could help me find a number to report this. they told me that they would not help.;36.6089000000001;-88.3030999999997
