Globular object surrounded by hazy distortion hovering over Murray, Ky.;2004-03-14 16:48:00;4 minutes;Globular object surrounded by hazy distortion hovering over Murray, Ky. At 4:48pm, my wife and I were traveling south on state highway 121. We were stopped at the stoplight on the Murray courtsquare when we spotted the object. It was at a height of about 2,000 ft, it appeared to be made of globes fit together (sort of like a child's jack) one on top and bottom,then three or four around the middle. It was a blackish silver with red highlights, it did not appear to be shiny but more of a flat metallic color. The sun was to our rear and right so the light did not obstruct our view. The object seemed to be hovering as its position did not change only our position realitve to it as we continued south. There was no sign of tethering of any kind. The weather was clear and there was a stiff breeze,it did not move as one would expect balloons to behave in the wind. The object did seem to change shape somewhat but it could have been revolving. The object had a field of disortion around it, we could easly see though it but there was a fuzzy  shimmer in a globe around the object. The traffic was heavy and we could not stop to observe it for more than a few minutes.;36.6089000000001;-88.3030999999997

It slowly began to move away from our position when it suddenly disappeared.   The duration of the event was approximately 30 seconds.
