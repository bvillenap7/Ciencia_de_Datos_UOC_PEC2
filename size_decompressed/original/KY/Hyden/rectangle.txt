They were almost like airplanes in the rear and in front a really well illuminated grey like giant wing shape in front of the blinking lights with no light on it at all other than you could see it as if it were day.   The humming continued until these massive objects had been out of view for several moments.   Was very odd as I don't believe in little green people but I am in awe as well as the other two people I was with about what it could have been that we just witnessed moving across the sky.   A neighborhood of dogs that normally would be barking all night long over nothing was erie silent. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
