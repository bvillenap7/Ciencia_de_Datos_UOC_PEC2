Strange low flying craft no sound VERY high detail visible in night sky.;2014-08-27 22:30:00;10 minutes;Strange low flying craft no sound VERY high detail visible in night sky. What appeared to be 3 craft moving east over the Wendover community.  3 red lights on each noticeable point and a illuminated triangular object with no lights on it but could be seen in the night sky as if it were spot lighted.  Moving super slow, no sound but some wind movement type noise even though there was no breeze.  Thought to be 3 individual objects but the center area on a clear night which all stars could be seen was blocking out stars with a blackness.  These were really low to the ground.  After contacting friends and family in the area found out a total of 22 people saw the same thing;37.1855;-83.4156
