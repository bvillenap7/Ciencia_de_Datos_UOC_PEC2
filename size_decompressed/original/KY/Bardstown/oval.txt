Two oval shaped UFOs in Bardstown KY;2003-06-22 16:00:00;5 minutes;Two oval shaped UFOs in Bardstown KY I witnessed, what I believe to be two unidentified objects in the sky about 4:15 p.m. on Sunday, June 22nd.  I was heading east from Bardstown going to I-65.  I noticed to the south of me two object which appeared to be white (or silver reflection).  They stayed stationary and were about 100 yards from each other, maybe a couple of thousand feet off the ground (above the tree line).  I even rolled down the window hoping I would hear something, but to no avail I did not hear anything.  Then I thought they were advertising balloons, but I could not convince myself they were balloons.  This is my very first experience witnessing such aircraft(s). I was wondering if there is anyway you can confirm if there were other reports like this one.  I do not know anyone in Bardstown other than the friends house I was leaving.;37.8065;-85.4592
