Bright lights over tree line in Kentucky;2004-09-26 00:30:00;3 - 5 minutes;Bright lights over tree line in Kentucky I was on my back porch about 12:30am looking to the North.  I saw a very bright light (ball form) hovering off in the distance above a tree line.  The light moved side to side so quickly all I could see were the tracers it left behind.  Then, the light got dim, moved upward, got much brighter and just disappeared. While I was watching it, I was paralyzed. All the hairs on my body stood on end, and I knew I had seen something I shouldn't have.  I went back out in the daylight hoping to find a cell tower in the place, but there are none.;37.8065;-85.4592
