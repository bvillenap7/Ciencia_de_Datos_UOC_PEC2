I was cleaning a store outside, as I came around the corner of the building to go to the dumpster I saw, what appeared at first to be a shooting star and was going to make a wish on it, but as it passed to the left I saw that it had an oblong shape to it from the back and could almost distinguish to rectangular engine ports side by side (no space between them). There were intense blue flames coming from them. It appeared to be low in the sky to the point that, concidering the angle it looked to be going, I expected to see a crash a few miles out of town. The whole incident only lasted about a second, it was traveling very fast and after I thought about it, I realized that it made NO sound whatsoever.;37.8065;-85.4592
