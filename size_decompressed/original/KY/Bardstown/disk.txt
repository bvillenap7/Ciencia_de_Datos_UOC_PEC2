yellowish gold saucer with lights hovering over house;1974-06-01 00:00:00;5-1O Minutes;yellowish gold saucer with lights hovering over house   I was a small child when this happen, but I remember waking up from sleep and going to my window and looking towards my neighbors house across the street and seeing a saucer right above their house.  It was yellow gold in color and had lights underneath it moving in a slow circular motion. I remember being very scared and going back to bed, but I felt as though there was something watching me outside my window. Since this encounter, all of my life I have had images of Grey beings visiting me atleast 3-4 times a month. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Yellow glowing saucer in Kentucky.;2012-08-12 22:20:00;About 6 to 10 seconds;Yellow glowing saucer in Kentucky. Just previously today I witnessed a saucer/circular shaped craft silenty fly by, just above the clouds. It was dark outside, but the object was clearly visible.  It was definitely there.  The object did not have any flashing lights. It did not have any visible lights at all.  The object itself had a very slight yellowish glow to it. And it was moving at a very high velocity.  I would say that the object left a trail, but it may have just been a light trail created by the high speed of the slightly glowing craft.  It was definitely saucer shaped.   I'm writing this less than 30 minutes after the event.  It is definitely still in good memory. This is not a hoax, or a joke.  Please take this seriously. Sincerely,   A Firm Believer.;37.8065;-85.4592
