Chevron shaped craft;2010-10-31 23:50:00;15 mins;Chevron shaped craft Saw large hovering object while driving south on 31E from Louisville to Bardstown KY.  Noticed the first object roughly 5miles south of Mt. Washington, KY.  Object seemed just to be very large and bright, but didn't seem to be moving, so I figured it was a cell tower.  As we got closer, we noticed that the object was in fact moving, but at an exceptionally slow pace.   Upon turning into Wal-Mart on John Rowan Blvd in Bardstown, stopped on the road to look up as an object the size of an airplane but angled more in a chevron shape flew over head.  The center light was extremely bright, and it had smaller red and green blinking lights.   At this point, I assumed maybe it was a jet, but, while traveling farther south out of Bardstown, I watched three of these crafts travel in a line formation in the same direction (South down 31E towards Hodgenville) too far apart to be on a military mission.  Then the three dispersed into a triangular shape each going in opposite direction, until they were too far away to really decipher anymore, though all the while they still seemed to be moving very slowly.;37.8065;-85.4592
