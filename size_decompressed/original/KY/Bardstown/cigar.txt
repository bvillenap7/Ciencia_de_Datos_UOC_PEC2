I was at Bernehim Forest outside of Bardstown Kentucky taking photos of the area.  I did not see the object with the naked eye.  I tranferred my photos to my laptop and that is when I noticed a cigar shaped silver object at a 45 degree angle in the upper right hand portion of the photo. I would just like for someone with advanced technology to examine this photo closely and see if they can tell me what the object in the photo is. This object was toward the southwestern sky.;37.8065;-85.4592
