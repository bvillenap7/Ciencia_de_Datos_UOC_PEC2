I saw a UFO may 24 2009 at 11pm or I think it was a UFO. We was on a camping trip to dale hollow lake when we saw it, We was standing at the campsite and I looked up at the beautiful sky and all at once I saw a flashing light streaming across the sky at an extremely high rate of speed. I looked at two of my friends and pointed it out and one of them said it a shooting stare, I told her shooting stars donâ€™t blink and all at once it stopped moving and changed direction three times and then streaked out of sight. I have never believed in UFOs but I have racked my brain on what it could have been and have come up empty. I would have never told any one if three of us had not witnessed it.;36.807;-85.3945
