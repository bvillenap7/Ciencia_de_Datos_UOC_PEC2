Odd light that changed directions.;2020-11-28 02:45:00;<2 seconds;Odd light that changed directions. While traveling down a small single lane country road myself and my friend witnessed a large, very bright  white light streaking down the sky. The entire event was probably less then 2 seconds. At first glance the object appeared to be a oddly bright pure white shooting star. While the object was tracking through the sky the object abruptly changed directions and began traveling straight up before disappearing.;36.682;-85.1426
