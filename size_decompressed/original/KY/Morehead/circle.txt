This changed the way I look at things forever and no one can tell me that I didn't see what I saw. NO ONE;1975-07-15 17:00:00;5 or 6 min.;This changed the way I look at things forever and no one can tell me that I didn't see what I saw. NO ONE I am a 44 year old man and I live in east centeral Ky. And when I was a kid about 15 years old my family lived on the west side of town by an abandond old railroad.Every evening after school a bunch of the neighborhood kids would go inbehind my neighbors utility shed in their back yard to sneak and smoke cigarettes. We were all standing around talking and smoking our cigarettes when one of the boys said look and was pointing up. I looked to where he was pointing and thats when I saw three disk in triangle fomation. These disk were in plain sight and in full daylight. They were perfectly around and chrome or silver in color. They all came to a stop just above our heads and they stoped at the same time just like they were one unit. I watched as they hovered right above us for abuot 5 or 6 minutes and they were close to us just barley clearing the hill tops. They never made a sound just sat in the sky for a few minetes then they all three took off, again as if they were one unit back the way they came over the hill tops. I will nevr forget what I saw and no one can tell me that I was seeing something else other than flying saucers. I don't call them U.F.O.'S Because I know what they were. As far as I'm concerned they were alien craft from somewhere other than this planet. Nothing can change my mind. I know what I saw and will be willing to take a lie detector test to prove that I'm NOT LYING... ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));38.1989999999998;-83.4436000000001
Metallic, circular object seen in daytime sky;2005-09-08 14:00:00;5 min;Metallic, circular object seen in daytime sky I was travelling east from Farmers, KY on US 60 towards Morehead.  As I looked due north, I observed a metallic circle object in the sky, approx. 1,000 feet up.  It did not appear to move and I watched it as the trees moved out of my way while driving.  As I entered the city, it had disappeared from my view.  Bright, sunny day, temps in upper 80's. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Strange light seen west of Morehead, Kentucky on December 23, 2005.;2005-12-23 19:00:00;10 Minutes;Strange light seen west of Morehead, Kentucky on December 23, 2005. My wife and I spotted a very BRIGHT circular object, as we were pulling out of the driveway to our home starting at approximately 1900 hrs.  The object was very high in the sky, at approximately 10-20 thousand feet.  It appeared to be hovering or orbiting in the same spot.  This object was bright light yellow to white in color.  Initially I thought it might have been a planet such as Mars or Venus.  However, after observing it, I ascertained that it was way too large, and bright to be either planet.  It appeared to be a big around as a Quarter turned on its side.  The object was hovering over an area approximately South, Southeast from my vicinity (Sharkey), and it appeared as though it were over Montgomery County (Mt. Sterling).  As my wife and I turned out of the subdivision where we live, and traveled south on KY 801 towards the community of Farmers, we could see this object with no problem whatsoever.  We just kept looking at(not a good thing to do while driving) it and when I arrived approximately 1/4 mile North of the West bound on ramp to Interstate 64, I decided to pull over to the side of the road.  We continued to sit and watch in amazement, while this large object remained stationary in approximately the same place.  I am a very methodical and logical man, and so I decided to rule out ALL possible explanations.  As I mentioned earlier, I ruled out a star, or planet, as it was too large and too bright to be either.  I then ruled out a fixed wing aircraft, as it had NO strobes, or beacons.  I also ruled out a fixed wing AC with a landing light on, as it never left the altitude OR heading to proceed to base, and would not have been able to hover.  I then ruled out rotary winged aircraft, using a spotlight, as it was too high to have used one effectively for ground searches.  Lastly, the object stayed this way for at least 15 minutes, after which, we decided to proceed on our way.  However, it was in the sky at least another 15 minutes, as my wife continued to monitor it after we turned East onto US 60 towards Morehead.  Once we arrived at approximately Big Perry, we could no longer see the object, due to the vegetation and elevation.  Unfortunately my wife FORGOT that she had her digital camera with us, and didn't take a few photo's.  Coincidentally, we arrived back on KY 801 about 30 minutes later, after traveling West on I-64, and saw no trace of this light in the sky, ruling out virtually ALL possiblity that we saw a planet or star earlier. ((NUFORC Note:  If the object was not a high-altitude aircraft, with a contrail behind it, being illuminated by the setting Sun, we do not know what the witnesses observed.

Metallic Disk Flying Over Morehead;2007-01-09 12:00:00;10 seconds;Metallic Disk Flying Over Morehead I was driving on KY 32 in the area beside McDonalds and the hospital. I was heading out of town (on the same side of the road as McDonalds). I noticed something out of the corner of my eye and immediately shifted my focus to the object. It was metallic in appearance and was shaped like a thick circle. It was moving at an unearthly rate of speed. The thing that most caught my attention was how fast it was moving. It was so close that I could hear sort of a seering sound when I rolled my window down. It appeard as if it was emitting heat (kind of like the road looks on a hot summer day - sort of a haze). I felt like the object must have hit the ground on the other side of the hill based on its speed and rate of decline. I have no explanation as to what this object was. It was travelling 3 times faster than a jet and was shaped like a thick, metallic plate. Almost looked like a weightlifting disk on a bench press. Its hard to estimate the size, but it was about the size of a nickel if I hold it straight out in front of my eyes.

Student sees UFO fly by 11th floor window in dorm.;2008-10-23 22:00:00;5 seconds;Student sees UFO fly by 11th floor window in dorm. I was sitting in the dorm room at Morehead State University (11th floor) when three brightly golden circular lights flew by the single window in the room. At first I thought it could have been a reflection within the rooms however the two light sources are static and would have not moved. Another possible reason I thought was that it was a light shone through the window however the building I live in is the highest and largest building on campus and in Morehead, not to mention that I live on the 11th floor. Therefore it is impossible for something to shine in perfectly horizontal as if it were right in front of the window. The only plausible conclusion is that I witnessed an UFO, possibly 3 separate ones one 1 with 3 lights. The lights were around 2 feet in diameter and were golden in color. The objects flew quickly and when I ran to the window and peered out they had vanished.;38.1989999999998;-83.4436000000001
