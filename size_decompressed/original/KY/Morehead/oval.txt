It seems to glow it is globular in shape;2004-09-21 22:00:00;25 seconds;We where on the roof of our home taking pictures of a sunset, we took four pictures of each of us standing in front of the sunset. With a Kodak easyshare, after downloading them into the picture files on our computer we discover that there is a white object off to the side, as we looked at the next three pictures we discover that the object moves farther away with each picture. The pictures where taken approximately three to five seconds apart. I am a non believer myself and I really want to find out what this is that we have unknowingly photographed. I don’t think that it is a digital malfunction of my camera because I have taken very good care of it and I have taken more the 1500 pictures with this camera. The object appears to be white or off white in color, on a standard 8’10’ print out it is one inch wide as well as long. It seems to glow it is globular in shape and has a darker maybe a shadow ring around the outer part of the outside of the circle shape. It stands out in all four pictures. We live on a big farm and we own dogs and ever since that night they bark relentlessly at times during the night. I don’t know if it is returning and I don’t want to know what it wants I just want to know that what ever is in these pictures are not here to harm us. For the most part you may not believe me but I was the one who brought the camera in and placed them into the folder and I did not leave this computer for anything. I was alone when I put them on and my boyfriend waked in as soon as I brought the picture to full screen. We both looked at each other and said :what is that? We then looked at the other three and confirmed that it was a moving object traveling in a northwest direction.;38.1989999999998;-83.4436000000001
