Strange flashing lights in the sky in South East Kentucky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly Sirius??  PD));2008-01-04 20:45:00;3 Hours;Strange flashing lights in the sky in South East Kentucky On Thursday Jan 04, 2008 a few friends and I noticed a strange light in the sky. This light was in the South East sky and we noticed it around 7:45 PM.  The light was very bright and seemed at first to be a plane or helicopter of some kind but we noticed it wasn’t moving. If it was moving it was at such an altitude we could not tell. Like I said the light was very bright. The light was blinking red, blue, and white. From the blinking you could see what appeared to be a triangle of light creating itself every time it blinked. The light seemed to get brighter and blink in a pattern – we watched it for awhile (approx. 30 min) and then went inside. While watching the light moved back and forth in sudden motions approxiamtely 1/2 inch the sky.  Approx at 9:30 we went to see if the light were still visible in the sky it had moved more south and wasn’t blinking as much.  We at first thought this might be a plane or helicopter. We ruled that out as we could see other planes in the sky at what appeared to be the same altitude and they were moving much faster. We also thought it might be a tower of some sort since at first it was stationary. We ruled that out when we watched several planes fly across the path of the light and it moved. Our next thought was maybe it was some astronomical event so we researched the news, Google Earth’s sky charts, and other astronomy databases. We didn’t find anything remotely close to the area except for Sirius and the description did not match what we witnessed. We also checked the alignments of the planets and noticed the planets were in a straight line on Google Earth - but the only visible one was Mars. We had been watching Mars for a week or so now so we have been watching the sky. We lined up Mars with Orion's belt to see if we could locate this flashing light  - but we could not.  As the time passed the light did not follow the path of the other stars and did seem dimmer.  We didn’t want to report it to the local news out of fear of being laughed at but we wanted to know if you people had any other reports of a similar affect. Also if you had not what this light might have been. Thank you  ((name and e-address deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly Sirius??  PD));38.1989999999998;-83.4436000000001
Three bright glowing orbs fly by dormatory building on Morehead State University, each is around 1 to 2 feet in width.;2008-11-23 22:37:00;a few seconds;Three bright glowing orbs fly by dormatory building on Morehead State University, each is around 1 to 2 feet in width. Okay, I'm entering this on behalf of my friend who saw this.  Primarily due to the fact I'm more interested in this and he is not at all.  We were on the eleventh floor of our Dorm on Morehead State University's campus.  Suddenly my friend claimed he saw three lights that were golden in color fly by our window.  Immediately we checked outside by opening the window as much as it could.  There was no other source of light that would have caused it. We did a laundry list of things it could possibly be, and none would have produced that light that close to our window.  In terms of arrangement he describes them in a line, not a perfect line, but basically one after the other.  Each orb was around 1 to 2 feet across.;38.1989999999998;-83.4436000000001
Eleventh Floor of Cartmell Hall at MSU Bright Red Orb 2 feet in width speeds by.  ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  Possible hoax.  PD));2008-12-10 18:01:00;3 seconds;Eleventh Floor of Cartmell Hall at MSU Bright Red Orb 2 feet in width speeds by. So I'm sitting in my Dorm in Cartmell Hall the eleventh floor. Suddenly this bright red light went by the window. The room is facing MSU's football field/baseball areas. It looked like it was probably around 2 feet across. Went extremely fast, could not keep up with it. Tried to determine other source for light, but could  not come to any conclusion. Friend claims there could be no other explanation except that there is none and it could very well be a UFO. So I decided to report it. The size/speed/light are what make me so curious.

Bright pulsating light in the sky with strange flight patterns.  Faded out completely when plane flew close to it.;2012-03-29 23:30:00;30 minutes;Bright pulsating light in the sky with strange flight patterns.  Faded out completely when plane flew close to it. At approximately 11:00pm-11:30pm my roommate and I observed a light over the mountains in the north-west sky over Morehead State University from our dorm room.  We thought that it was just a pulsating star at first, but then we realized it was moving very slowly towards a cellphone tower on the hill. It would occasionally dip below the mountains then fly upwards back into the sky. The bright golden light would shine extremely bright and then get very dim to the point that we could barely see it, and then it would get very bright again.  At some point during the night another strange thing occurred.  A plane flew within the vicinity of the glowing light and the light disappeared entirely until the plane was gone.  After the plane had left, the light reappeared for a few more minutes until fading out completely.  The light never appeared again during the night.  This was a very strange occurrence and my roommate and I swear it wasn’t a plane or a star because ! of the way it moved.;38.1989999999998;-83.4436000000001
Flashing red and white lights spaced apart in a triangle form.  Sight in all seasons even when there are no stars visable.;2016-05-24 21:00:00;3 hours;Flashing red and white lights spaced apart in a triangle form.  Sight in all seasons even when there are no stars visable Morehead, Ky 04/24/16   Have seen this set of lights for about over a year now.  They are normally in a position of a triangle and flash red and white lights.  Sighting almost every night during moonlight, and very dark nights. And when there are no stars showing at all. In all seasons.  View them on and off all night long into the wee hours of the morning.  The positions of the distance seem to vary making the shape of the triangle very large at times.   Sometimes two of the lights will not be there leaving only one, usually the brightest one still up there.  This goes on for hours.;38.1989999999998;-83.4436000000001
Moving glowing light with a halo type ring around it traveling from W to E.  ((anonymous report));2017-06-09 22:00:00;2 minutes;I was sitting on my back balcony, staring off at the sky a bit, when a moving glowing light with a halo type ring around it traveling from west to east captured my eyes.  I thought for a second it was a shooting star then realized it's traveling very slow, and then concluded it wasn't a plane either.  It was traveling low, no blinking lights, and not noise.   And explain how any man made construction just fades off in the distance really fast.   Funny thing was, it looked like it was heading straight towards the full moon tonight.
