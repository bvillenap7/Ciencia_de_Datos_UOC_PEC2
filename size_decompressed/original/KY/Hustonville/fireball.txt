red fire ball over Hustonville Kentucky  7/4/08;2008-07-04 21:30:00;10 minutes;red fire ball over Hustonville Kentucky  7/4/08 At approximately 2130 hours, it is believed that an unidentified flying object entered airspace around my residence.  During a game of cards, we were summoned to the porch by a relative who saw a red fiery object in the Southern sky.  As we all observed the object - which appeared to be red and eminating flames from the right and left, a bright red glow filled the center.  It appeared to be ascending towards our location and after about 2 minutes of observation, the fiery glow dissipated and the bright red glow seemed to then be travelling away from the house.  The glow continued to travel away until it eventually just went out.  It was completely unexplained.  After re-entering the house after the light had completely went out - cell phone service was unavailable for approximately 5 minutes. We ruled out the idea that it could have been something in space as the night sky was overcast with heavy cloud cover.  There was not another illuminous celestial object in the sky at the time that this was observed. If it would have been a plane, then the ascension would have been more vetical as opposed to diagonal.
