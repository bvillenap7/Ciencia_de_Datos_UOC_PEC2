agile flashing craft outside of cincinnati;2002-02-17 22:00:00;2 minutes;agile flashing craft outside of cincinnati We were driving on route 25 south toward ohio and saw what appeared to be very small jet airplanes with flashing lights that were much faster and somehow different from regular aircraft.  These jets were flying faster than other planes, we saw one next to a regular airplane and it seemed very small, fast and agile.  We saw three going from north to south within approximatly 20 seconds of each other and then throughout the hour we saw periodic jets in in the area.  The craft did make a very quiet jet like sound.  These were much faster and more agile than normal planes.  The jet had one red light that stayed on consistantly and then a flashing red light and two white strobing lights.  The speed, agility and strobing lights are what differ from regular planes.;38.7062;-84.6194
