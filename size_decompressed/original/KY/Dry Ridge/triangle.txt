Triangular with many light;2012-02-19 20:00:00;2 minutes;triangular with many light i was laying on the couch and i saw in the window a plane heading north,then all of the sudden it made a sharp left turn and started my direction still thinking it was an airplane or helicopter. well knowing that planes can not turn like that i made a seasonable assumption it may have been a helicopter. then realizing that even helicopters can not make a turn such as this object did! so it sparked my attention. i got up to look out the window and watch the object draw closer.thinking that it was just an illusion because of the distance away from me that the object actually was but still yet i watched it,i turned my head to look at my cat who had just jumped up onto the television the next thing i knew the object was almost right over head!lots of lights some blinking some not! the object was maybe a block away..i was amazed by all the lights that i started to run up the stairs and was yelling for my friend to come see the object,by the time i got out side ! it was over the house so i ran through the house to the back door and went for the back deck when i got to the back deck the object was gone not a trace of it to bee seen.my friend was so like what is the emergency i said it was a U.F.O SHE LAUGHED!!! i assure you that i have been pondering weter to tell someone or not...she, my friend knows that it must have been something because i would never tell a crazy story like this for no apparent reason! i am still very apprehensive of telling anyone but i had to tell someone!!!...i did not know wether to call the state police ,which there is a state police post less then a mile from this location. the object was triangular in shape very huge many light blinking and non blinking. the object may have been 1 hundred or more feet tall!!!!i did not see the back side of the object!! it was very stealthy never heard it!!and it was very obviously very very quick!;38.7062;-84.6194
