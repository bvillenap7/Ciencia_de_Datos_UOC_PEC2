Saw what I thought was a star, until it moved then disappeared.;1997-06-15 22:00:00;10 seconds;Saw what I thought was a star, until it moved then disappeared. This happened several years ago, approx. between 1996-1998. I was outside in my back yard, looking at the clear sky and I saw a bright star (or so I thought). For the first couple of seconds it was still, but then it slowly started moving west and started getting a bit brighter and slightly larger at the same time, like it was getting closer until it was about double the size of the avg. star you see. If you were to hold a ruler up to the sky and measure the distance it traveled in inches, I'd say it moved about an inch-inch and a half. It continued moving for only around 5 seconds and then just like that it was gone. It didn't leave a trail or anything, it just blinked into nothingness.
