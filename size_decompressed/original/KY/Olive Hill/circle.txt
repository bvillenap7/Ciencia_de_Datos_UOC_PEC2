Bright, slow moving orange craft over Olive Hill Kentucky.;2011-05-04 23:30:00;1-2 minutes;Bright, slow moving orange craft over Olive Hill Kentucky. It caught my eye as I pulled into my driveway.  The craft was an extremely bright orange at the center, with a strobe light on both the right and left sides.  It moved along at a slow pace as it crossed the sky from one side of the horizon, to directly over me, then onto the hill.  As the craft was moving from left to right in the sky slowly and passed, I saw a commercial airliner going from right to left, which explains the dull hum of the airplane engine I heard (sorry about not knowing the cardinal directions from my location).  The aircraft was so bright that it was almost hard to look at, but the orange glow didn't appear to be fluctuating, but a solid orange mass.  The sky was extremely clear, so the objects were very visible.;38.298;-83.1758
