It would move to the right, then down, then back to its original position.  We drove in its direction and it did climb higher in the sky and get brighter.  It flashed (blinked) twice a few times.  Also we noticed a smaller one near it.  It continued to wander about up to the time we left.;37.3268000000002;-87.4958000000004

Local radio station reporting on UFO or whatever it was,lots of callers were seeing the same thing.  ((Venus??));2005-11-25 18:45:00;30-45 min.;Local radio station reporting on UFO or whatever it was,lots of callers were seeing the same thing. I have already given my report to you on 11-25-05.I left out that the local radio station was recieving reports of the UFO or what ever it was.This is the reason that I and my family got to see IT.One of the listeners of the radio station(96 WSTO)-( located in Evansville,IN.) gave really good instructions on where in the sky to look to see IT.I think she was from Madisonville and most of the callers had to be around this area to see IT.The listener said she had been watching IT for more than a half hour.The DJ said there were numerous callers reporting that they were seeing the same thing and wanted to know what IT was,of course he was making fun of the callers and not taking it seriously.The next day 11-26-05 the radio station was still talking about what happened and about how many calls that they recieved,sure some calls were bogus but we saw something thursday night 11-25-05.Sorry I didn't tell this in my original report.Hope it helps.

Bright light /object in the Eastern sky.;2012-04-06 22:50:00;A few minutes;Bright light /object in the Eastern sky. Was driving East in to town and looked over to the North and saw what appeared to be a really bright light. The object/light seemed to be over town and stationary. I continued to drive east and lost sight of it because of trees and then looked back where it was once I past the trees and it was gone. The Moon was full but in the western sky. I tried to find it again  once I stopped to get gas and still nothing. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

City wide blackout with strange strobe lights.;2014-05-20 00:00:00;~45 minutes;City wide blackout with strange strobe lights County wide blackout left our neighborhood in city limits pitch black.  Husband and I went outside and saw strobe light flashing of green, red, and white over the tall oaks.  People from all over the county saw something different but all thought it had something to do with something not of this world.   The reports today on SurfKy.com stated something vaguely of an explosion.  It doesn't seem to fit due to the massive amounts of people that were outside at midnight to see (and feel) this.  It felt very uneasy.   The dogs started going berserk in the neighborhood just before the power came back on.   The lights lasted for about 15 of the 45 minutes that the power was out.  Very strange.   If it WAS an explosion, there was no sound and no damage that an explosion that could be viewed from all sides of the city would have made.   We are getting lied to.;37.3268000000002;-87.4958000000004
