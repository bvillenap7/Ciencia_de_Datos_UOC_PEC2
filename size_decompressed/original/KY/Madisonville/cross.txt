Two orange stationary lights in the sky fade then reappear.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus and Jupiter??  PD));2015-06-29 21:45:00;30 minutes;Two orange stationary lights in the sky fade then reappear. It was so cloudy tonight that no stars could be seen and the moon was hard to find as well.  Yet, there were two orange colored crosses/diamonds in the sky.  They weren't there yesterday.  The larger one is on bottom and there was a smaller one diagonal from it (northwest), almost at a perfect 45 degree angle.   While watching them we noticed the top star began to dim and fade.  The bottom one did the same.  A minute passed by and the bottom one slowly began to brighten like a light on a dimmer switch.  Then the top one followed.   We took a picture with a digital camera.   After 30 minutes they disappeared completely. ((NUFORC Note:  Venus and Jupiter??  PD));37.3268000000002;-87.4958000000004
