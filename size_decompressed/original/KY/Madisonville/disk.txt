It caught our attention because it was flashing red and bright white lights in a rotating pattern.It was stationary in the sky for about fifteen minutes and then we noticed small flashes of light some distance away these lights were of jets. We actually witnessed a jet fly near the object and then retreat.A short time later (two/three minutes)we saw five other jets scoping out the area. The UFO then began movely extremely slowly up and down, bobbing in the sky. The jets all moved out very quickly, and the UFO slowly disappeared into the night.;37.3268000000002;-87.4958000000004
