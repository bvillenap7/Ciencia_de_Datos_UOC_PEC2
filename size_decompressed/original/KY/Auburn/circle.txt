Fast moving white sphere with greenish blue outer layer with a cone shaped trail.;2013-08-04 20:15:00;30 seconds;Fast moving white sphere with greenish blue outer layer with a cone shaped trail. Date of reported UFO sighting:  Sunday August 4, 2013 Time of UFO sighting:  Approx. 8:15 pm CST Location:  Auburn, Kentucky My husband and I were doing our nightly walk in the local park and when we finished we were getting back in our vehicle to go home and saw the UFO. The best description I can submit to you is this UFO appeared to us as a round glowing white ball shaped object with a tail and the outer layer was glowing a greenish blue color.  It was low in the sky and traveling (the best we can estimate) from North to South in a downward path.  This object was moving on quickly and disappeared as quickly as it appeared.  We tried to follow it’s decent to see if something landed or crashed, etc. but we didn’t see anything.  We were very, very puzzled and disturbed to be honest.  This is very much a “first” for both of us.  Even though it was 8:15pm it was still daylight outside. It was a weird experience but I am glad I saw this!;36.879;-86.7223
