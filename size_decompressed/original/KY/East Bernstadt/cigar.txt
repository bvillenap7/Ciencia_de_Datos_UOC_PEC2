We saw a cigar craft chasing four army or airforce jets;1994-08-15 11:00:00;60 seconds or less;We saw a cigar craft chasing four army or airforce jets My second and third sightings happened in East Bernstadt, Kentucky Mid-august 1994. I was visiting a friend in the East Bernstadt, Kentucky and we were outside on his porch when we heard a loud noise of airplanes his house. There were four army jets traveling as fast as they could and taking evasive actions. Then a second or so later a silver cigar shaped craft came over the house. The Jets and cigar shaped craft were quite high (I would assume 1,000 feet or more high. I would also assume the cigar craft was 100 feet long. The UFO chased the four jets across the city of East Bernstadt . I did not hear any noise from the craft but it sis leave a very short contrail. The jets and craft were going East to West. When the cigar shaped craft got over a hill we could see in the distance it stopped and hovered there for 10-15 seconds then went straight up out of sight at a great rate of speed. Two weeks later I saw the same or similar craft traveling slowly from the north west to the south east over the same town. My friend and I tried to tell others about this sighting but they teased saying that we saw the Goodyear blimp. Well the blimp can not keep up and gain on four army jets traveling fast as they can, and does not leave a short contrail ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
