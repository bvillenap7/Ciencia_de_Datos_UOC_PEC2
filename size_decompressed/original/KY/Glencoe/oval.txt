Oblong objects that meet together Glencoe, KY.  2 hours;2015-05-07 21:30:00;23:00;Oblong objects that meet together Glencoe Ky 2 hours Started showing up about 3 weeks ago every evening.   At first, I only noticed one but lately more seem to meet in sky.  They hang around a while moving around slowly.  Now tonight I saw at least 5 in the sky.  I only have binoculars but when I look through them I see one main light seems to move around.  Sometimes I can see a few blue lights with the naked eye.  Its long in shape with the blue lights towards the bottom of the object.  They seem just hovering over the area here.  I did make my roommate go out and look one evening.  He saw it but didn't really seem to care but he did see it.  I'm really just curious on what i'm seeing.  If anyone could give me a idea of what it could be I would appreciate a answer.  It's not scaring me I'm just curious.;38.7204;-84.8123
