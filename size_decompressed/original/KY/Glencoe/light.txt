Bright  light over Owen co. kentucky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Second object was ISS.  PD));2009-07-26 21:40:00;3 mins.;Bright  light over Owen co. kentucky Object appeared to be a comet at first.  It was a dull green in color and had a streaking tail that was a green yellow in color.  It came from every high in the sky and was traveling due north. The object started to slow and came with in just miles and changed color to a very bright intense white color.  It almost seem to pulsate. The light wasn't a very large light,but was slightly larger than that of a passenger plane.The lighted object came to a near dead stop,just kind of wobbled and then changed it's direction from due north to due east. All this took only 40 or 50 seconds. I then got everyone out of the house and when we got back out of the house the object was still very close and was still moving due east.  We then watched the object move off very slowly. After about 2 minutes of watching the object,it just seemed to take off at a unreal speed.The reason i say this is that the object went from a large object in the sky to a very small one in just seconds.  And just disappeared. Shortly after,20seconds or so. We heard what appeared to be two very loud planes traveling very low to the ground,without any lights. ((NUFORC Note:  Second object was ISS.
