Extremely high speed lights in night sky.;2007-05-31 22:00:00;2 sec;Extremely high speed lights in night sky. 2 parallel streaks of light (in night sky) directly above then 45 degrees across sky in a straight line from SE to NW. Then return of same from NW to SE. All within 2 sec from start to finish. No clouds. Not floodlights.No sound from craft. This happened at a speed close to the limits of human perception. The lights were moving so fast they were smeared into streaks. Might have been two spyplanes on close to opposite headings. London is an aviation waypoint, so I see planes all the time.  And, I have seen meteor showers. These craft made meteors look very slow in comparsion.;37.1497943573668;-84.099582758621
