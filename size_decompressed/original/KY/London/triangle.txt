My 10 year old son and I went out to see if we could see any meteors from the meteor shower the night before.  My son said there's one dad.  I told him no I think thats a star and kept looking.  He said Dad its moving!!  I looked and it was!!  It was bright red and as it approached it was a triangle.   There was no flashing lights as with airplanes, but it had a green light on one end, red light on the other end, and a white light in the front.  Then suddenly a bright light lit up in the center of it and never came back on.  No sound with it at all.  All of a sudden all the lights went white....and it kept going... Very strange.  First time i have seen anything like this.;37.1497943573668;-84.099582758621
