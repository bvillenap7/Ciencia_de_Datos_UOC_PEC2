At 9:30pm I noticed a black circular object with a glowing red light on the underside. It made no sound and remained in one place. I asked my wife to come and see, and she agreed that it was not a normal object. She went to get the camera, and as i was focusing to take a picture it zipped quickly north and then very fast took off west and out of sight. It appeared to be about 150ft away and 50 feet up. IT WAS AWESOME! This is the first time I have ever seen anything in the sky that could not be explained.;37.1497943573668;-84.099582758621
Orange UFO passing or hovering through London Kentucky on July 4th;2010-07-04 21:00:00;30 Min;Orange UFO passing or hovering through London Kentucky on July 4th I took my family on a ride on the evening of July 4th to look for fireworks.  Of course we found plenty and as we were driving I noticed like a dim orange constant shape in the sky.  It was much higher than any of the fireworks and it was either very slow moving or just hovering.  I believe it was very slow moving.  I pointed it out to my wife and we watched it for a few minutes ..  But then went back to gazing at the fireworks with my family.  I saw it again upon returning home.  There was no flashing lights and no sound that could be heard.  I saw some people discussing seeing this object on the gossip website topix.com;37.1497943573668;-84.099582758621
