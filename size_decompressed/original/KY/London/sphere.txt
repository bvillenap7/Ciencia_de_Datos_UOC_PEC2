extremely bright ball of light looks like a star or planet.  ((Venus??));2020-01-08 17:45:00;1 hour;extremely bright ball of light looks like a star or planet. I have noticed a extremely bright ball of light the resembles a star or planet in the night sky sometimes ever night and then nothing for a long while. It comes from the East or Southeastern hemisphere or night sky and move very slowly and quietly to the West or Northwestern Horizon. I have made several videos and will continue to do so as It comes. You can see very clearly that it is within the atmosphere of the planet and not a star, planet, drone, or star link sat.. flying in orbit. Its as high as a passenger airliner and fairly big you can tell from discernment of good observation. It looks like the ufo that appeared over the temple mount in 2011. When ever we first noticed thi ufo several years ago, me, my wife and daughter all had a paranormal experience with a really bright fl ash oh light. My daughter seen it flash above our home one evening about 3 years back and about a week later I had just lay down for bed at around 5am my bedroom has no uncovere! d Windows that light can come through from having heavy dark fabric covering them. About 5 minutes after laying down I seen a bright flash of light only for a millisecond and immediately arise and woke my wife and said did you see that? and she said what that flash of light.  .I  said what????? how did you see what I seen and you snoring with your head underneath a body pillow. WOW!!! It's been coming around every since that happened. It seems people all over are posting videos like the one ai already mention on YouTube of the same type ufo from all over the world either orange in color or pure white color as I see quite often. If anyone nows what this is or have information That might further our enlightenment of what this is please say on here in  a report. Thanks God bless.;37.1497943573668;-84.099582758621
