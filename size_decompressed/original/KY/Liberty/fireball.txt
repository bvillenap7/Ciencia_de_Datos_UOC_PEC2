orange firery ball/ pouring out green and purple smoke from beneath./ at night-very visible;1994-11-15 23:00:00;15 mins;orange firery ball/ pouring out green and purple smoke from beneath./ at night-very visible we say a deep reddish/orange glow. low in the sky about a quarter mile from the house. it was circular in shape but had no exact boundry line. it appeared to be approximatly 100ft across from left to right and was susspected to be an orb or ball shape. it seemed to pulsate slightly and eventually began pumping or letting smoke pour from underneath. that was bright green and changed to bright purple. very colorful. very deep color. the smoke seemed to waft down onto the tree tops and flow gently and constantly towards the ground very liberally. we observed this for about 15 or 20 minutes with no sound. and it gradually moved away out of sight. we got into a car and tried to find it again. just when we thought we would never see it again we turned a curve on a very secludid country road and there it was again. doing the same thing. we observed it again for about 5 minutes then it stopped releasing smoke and it seemed to pulse brightly very quick one time. like we made it mad. and it moved away somewhat slowly. as if we interupted it. and it desired to make a casual retreat. it moved out of sight and was never seen again.;37.3167;-84.9735
