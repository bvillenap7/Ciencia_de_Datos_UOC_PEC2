huge black cigar shaped object over central ky.;1993-05-27 23:30:00;10 mins;huge black cigar shaped object over central ky. i witnessed this object 3 times. each time late at night. traveling east to west. approximate size at least one quarter mile in length. width,approximately 200feet. altitude approximatly. 2-miles high. flying directly over small town. i lived on a ridge top overlooking the town. the lights from town lit up the bottom of the craft. it was dark in color possibly black. with no visible markings. and no visible wings. it had one extremely large red light on the bottom/center. that changed in brightness. and seemed to pulsate very slowly. that was the only light on the craft. it had a very deep low tone that i could hear from inside the house. from a long way off. i was outside and waiting for it before i even saw it. it moved very slowly for an air ship. not more than 100 miles an hour. not less than 60 miles an hour. as it approached closer, the low hum turned into more of a vibration of electrical noise. it was so big, and at such a low altitude, it was rather disturbing. and gave me an uneasy feeling. i am ex-navy/air. and i have never seen anything like this ever. it was the biggest object i have ever seen in the air. it had a dull look to it's under belly. and was deffinatly dark. most likely flat-black. it was seen by only me. i have never heard of anybody else in this town or anywhere else describing the same thing. i saw it three times. over the corse of 4 months. at that time i was watching the skies frequently. almost every night during that summer. between 9pm and 12pm.;37.3167;-84.9735
