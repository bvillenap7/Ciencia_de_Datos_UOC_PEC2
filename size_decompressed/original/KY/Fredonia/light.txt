On Friday night, at approximately 8 PM CST, my sister and I witnessed 13 large (presumably military) aircraft flying in what I would describe as an offset straight line.  They were flying one after the other, but not directly behind each other.  One would be on the right, the next would be flying just off the former's left wing, and so forth.  Each plane had a blinking red light on the end of each wing and a single static white light in the center of the plane.  The planes seemed much quieter than usual.  Although they were flying relatively low, we could only hear a slight drone or slight humming noise.  Once they were no longer directly overhead, they were silent.  When they were far enough away that someone could no longer see they were actually planes, they just looked like a large number of blinking red lights in the sky and it was EERIE and STRANGE.  I have NO DOUBT these were at least some of the red lights you all have been sent reports of from wit! nesses all over the country. While I believe these conventional craft triggered the mass sighting, the sheer number of them, the pattern in which they were flying and their relative quietness were definitely strange and should be investigated in my opinion.  I live close to a large military base and witness maneuvers year-round and at all hours of the day and night.  I have NEVER seen anything like what I say Friday night.  It was NOT normal in any way.  The planes were flying in a West-Northwest direction, heading toward Missouri.;37.2133;-88.0105
