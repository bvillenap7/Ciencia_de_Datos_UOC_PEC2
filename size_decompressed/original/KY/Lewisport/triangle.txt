Have video of it and many, many wild pictures I just can't explain. At some points it looks like a ball of plasma spinning and pulsating different intensely bright colors. And when I say my phone to take several pictures at once, it seems to change general shape an color. But about every few shots of there is a definitive triangular shape.  Last night it was not there, but the night before it was on the other side of the sky.  And also days before that in another area. I have photos and video.  Have been really seeing these things since the summer in 2017. But by far much more regularly as of late;37.9069;-86.8939
