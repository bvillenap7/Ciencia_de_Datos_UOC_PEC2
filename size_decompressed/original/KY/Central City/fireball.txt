I live in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania and am currently working on a project in Paducah, KY. On my trip back to Paducah after the holidays I was traveling west on West Kentucky Parkway around 9:00 - 10:00pm when I noticed a large red object directly in front of me (about 1/2 mile) and 1/2 mile up in the air. The red object also had a whitish halo around it. I did not notice any other vechiles around and no towers. The object stayed there for 20 seconds or so and dissappeared up and away.  I was driving at 70mph on the highway and did not see anything after that.;37.3088;-87.1195
