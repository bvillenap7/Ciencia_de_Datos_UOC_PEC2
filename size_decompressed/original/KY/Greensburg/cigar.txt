Strange elliptical lights over ky sky's;2011-10-25 23:00:00;30 minutes;Strange elliptical lights over ky sky's Me and a friend from two separate locations in the same county watched these ufos they were elliptical shaped.  Hazel colored light that did not strobe like an aircraft that would slowly move across the sky at very low altitude.  They moved slow then would jolt about five 10 inches and dead stop then vanish. Then reappear in about 30 seconds.  I watched two of them do this until they both went out of sight.  I appologize I couldn't get a picture or video.;37.2407;-85.5223
