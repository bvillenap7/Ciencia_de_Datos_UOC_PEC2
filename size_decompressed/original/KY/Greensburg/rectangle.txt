Cloud with a ship inside       10/02/05 My girlfriend and I were coming home about 1:00 am  on a very clear star filled sky.   Just as we pulled up the hill in front of our house, I pointed out a large cloud in the sky and told my girlfriend to notice that it looked like a storm cloud because it was lighting up like with lightning inside it.  As we were watching a small light dropped out of the cloud on our right side then a second later another one dropped out of the left side.  They both hovered there for maybe 5  seconds, with the one on the left being a little higher in the sky than the one on the right. Then they took off to our left ,,,which would be east,,,and were gone in a flash.  The cloud continued toward us looking like it was going to pass right over us.   My girlfriend at this point grabbed our 3 year old daughter, who was asleep and ran in the house being very scared that it was going to do something to us.   I followed her in the house and got my binoculars. When I went back out it had gotten within 500 yards of our house and with my binoculars I could see in the cloud and saw a huge ship with windows and doors  made of some dark kind of metal.It made a light sound like the wind blowing very light but the lightning type flashes made no sound at all.I watched it as it moved slowly to the north at about 10 mph.
