I was driving down the road and happened to glance up to my right, where over the top of the mountain was something that looked kinda like a flying PT Cruiser. I know it sounds crazy but that's what I thought of when I saw it. I drew it to the attention of the other passenger in the car, and she saw it to. But I looked forward at the road and when I looked back it was gone. It was broad daylight and I know I saw something that looked like a PT Cruiser just hovering over the top of the mountain. ((NUFORC Note:  We will request a second report from the other witness.  If it was broad daylight, the time must have bee 12:00 p.m., not a.m., as indicated by the witness.  PD));37.6605;-82.7628
