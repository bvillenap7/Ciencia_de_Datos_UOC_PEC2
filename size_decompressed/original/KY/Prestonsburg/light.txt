Been   doin it  since   last  summer   to  this  spring-time here in  Kentucky. Alway's   the I think  the    dipper   to  my   left and the   moon  side  to  my  right. But  this  night i  went  out and   I  alway's  gaze used  to it!  And, I  seen what   was  a  glowing  light  shpere like  large   star up  over  Kentucky hills  there  from  the   apartments!  and not   sure  of  direction    but I  looked  at  it  and It  was  not  something  that  was  supposed  to be  there. - so I   watched -getting  more  nervouse(scared to  be  precise) and then it  seemed  to   move  with  more  glowing  light  interaction and two only  two objects  circumferenced  it to the  right   side of  the  sphere  and  I  watched and  they   seemed to  oscillate sumwhat! Getting  more  proturbed  I  took a  good  second look  and  scurried  back to  bed .Told   wife  later   and  you   know   response  so  I  just  let  it  go  but  It  was  never  to appear  anything in that same  place over  the trees. Nothing  there anymore. That's it!  That   space  over  those  hills(trees)   empty  and  nothing more  resumed    there!It's   clear   sky  again!
