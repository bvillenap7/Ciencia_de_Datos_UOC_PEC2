Four streaking fireballs that turned into four solid lights over Cincinnati, OH.;2009-11-13 19:35:00;2 minutes;Four streaking fireballs that turned into four solid lights over Cincinnati, OH. I was outside in the driveway getting drywall off my trailer.  Out of the corner of my eye I saw 4 streaking lights.  From my location they appeared to be over the city Cincinnati, OH.  My first thought was that it was a metor shower.  The streaks appeared to be coming straight down and it looked like they were burning up as they entered the atmosphere.  The streaks disappeared and seconds later the reappeared as four solid lights.  One of the lights stayed in the same spot, and the other three were moving around.  They would fade off into the distance and then reappear.  They would also move from side to side.  I watched the objects for about two minute before all four of them finally disappead off into the distance.;38.9986;-84.501
