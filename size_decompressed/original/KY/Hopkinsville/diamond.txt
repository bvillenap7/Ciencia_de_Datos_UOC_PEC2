moving star while rest stayed there the rest of the night?;2008-11-07 13:45:00;Maybe a minute;moving star while rest stayed there the rest of the night? I am a truck driver out of Cincinnati, OH. I was picking up car parts last night just outside (west route 31). I was backing my truck into the doc.  As I was sitting in my cab, I noticed a star like light, that I thought was actually a bigger or closer star.  I didnâ€™t think a whole lot about it except it seemed a little closer to the horizon.  I wrote in my log book the time I arrived, and looked back out the truck window, and the large star was gone.  Another star to its left was there the rest of the stop.   I am not saying it was a ufo I saw, but wanted to report this in case anyone else saw anything.  Hopkinsville exit number 8 (pennyrail hwy), is near where I picked up parts.;36.8637168421052;-87.4862968421053
