3 lights;2005-06-01 16:00:00;20mins;3 lights One day my kids and I was at the park. I was sitting on the bench while they played. I looked in the sky and saw three lights in the shape of a triangle. They was not moving. I called my kids and the girl i do a mentoring program with over and told them to look in the sky. They wanted to know what it was. I did not know. I kind of joked with them and told them it might be a UFO. We sit there and saw it for a while. When we got up to go, we looked up and they was gone.  We shrugged it off. The more I explored this website after Mr. Davenport came to our town and spoke, i decided to post my little experience on here to see if anyone else noticed the lights in the sky.

Extra star seen moving across the big dipper and then fading.;2010-07-02 22:55:00;5 sec;Extra star seen moving across the big dipper and then fading. At around 10:55 PM, my wife and I were enjoying a walk out under the stars in our neighborhood.  The skies were clear so we could easily see the stars and had been looking up pointing out which constellations we knew.  During this time I was looking up at the big dipper and noticed an extra star in the middle of the constellation which through me off for a second.  It was the exact same size and brightness as the other stars in the constellation but was moving.  I pointed it out to my wife because it didn’t look like a plane since usually a plane would have multiple lights or flashing lights.  We watched it move from right to left at a 45 degree downward angle over the course of about five seconds as it crossed a distance about equal the size of the constellation.  As it moved downwards the light began to fade until we could no longer see it.  This was also odd because there were no clouds for it to disappear behind.;36.8637168421052;-87.4862968421053
Lights near I-24 Mile Markers 80-77.;2017-11-20 17:40:00;3 minutes;Lights near I-24 mile markers 80-77. I was traveling home from work, west bound on I-24, around 5:40pm, and around mile marker 80, or so, I saw 2 large lights in the sky to my left.  They were bigger than any plane or stars in the sky, and were just sitting there not moving.   I then saw a 3rd light to the right of those just above the horizon line, and it shot at a 45 degree angle upwards towards the other 2 white lights.  The light farthest to the left then seemed to fade like it was going away from me.  I lost sight of the lights just before Mile Marker 77 because there is a big heavily wooded hill that blocks the view of the sky just briefly, but after I passed the hill and regained view of the skyline, all 3 lights were gone. I have seen 2 lights in that same area maybe 6 or 7 years ago while riding home from work on the same road close to the same time and at that time, I thought I was about to witness a plane crash, or something, as the lights were spiraling around each other heading towards the ground, but then stopped just above the horizon.  My friend, whom I carpooled with, was driving, and I asked him if he seen those crazy lights just out of his left window, but he did not, and just as i said above once I lost sight of the sky due to the terrain I couldn't find them again. I came home and told my brother about the lights I saw recently and he typed in west ky ufo sightings and lo and behold he found a story on this sight that was so similar to what I had seen and in the same place that I had to post this in hopes that the previous poster sees this and gains some sort of verification to his story.

We all three seen a bright round ball of light floating across the sky not blinking, traveling at a slow speed in a straight line heading from south to north... this was not a shooting star! It wasn’t fast nor did it fade away.;36.8637168421052;-87.4862968421053
