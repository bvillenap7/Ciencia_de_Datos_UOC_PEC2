Object seen over the skies of Kentucky.;2002-11-08 15:00:00;5 minutes;Object seen over the skies of Kentucky. On Friday, November 8th at approximatley 15:00 hours, I observed two jet aircraft off in the distance. They seemed to be following one another. At that time, I noticed a bright object resembling a star in the same vacinity as the aircraft. The bright object dissappeared from my sight and it was at that time that both aircraft made a sharp right turn and were coming in my direction (aircraft were going north and made a turn to the south-east). I then looked straight up and noticed an object above resembling an aircraft body but was unable to distinguish any wings on the object. The aircraft were leaving vapor trails but the object was not. The aircraft then made another right turn as if following the object. I could not tell what type of aircraft they were because of their altitude, I assumed they were military. The object was shiney silver in color and appeared to be large. The following day, I told my brother about what I had seen and he informed me of the object seen by the photographer for FOX TV. I then found the picture of that object on this website and it appeared to be similar in shape to what I had seen. Could it have been the same object? Were there any further reports from this area?
