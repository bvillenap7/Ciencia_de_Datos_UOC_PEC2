Square lava-colored craft.;2015-05-20 03:06:00;?;Square lava colored craft. I stepped outside for a few minutes and saw a square that was pulsating with red and black. I heard what sounded like thunder and looked up.  It made no sound and was slowly hovering/flying towards a military base.  Normally I wouldn't think anything of it, except the whole thing is square and pulsating.  I heard dogs barking and someones radio going.  There was no wind, no noise, changes from red to black like its made of lava.  The sides were even square.  After it disappeared I noticed that there was no noise and everything was quiet and that I had lost 45 minutes of time.  Hope I never see it again.  It took me a year to get the nerve to post this.  It's still bothering me.;36.8637168421052;-87.4862968421053
