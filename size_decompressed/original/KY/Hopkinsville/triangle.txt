Three orange flying objects flying in a stationary position formed into a triangle.;2020-01-08 19:00:00;6 minutes;Three orange flying objects flying in a stationary position formed into a triangle. I was driving, and noticed 3 orange glowing circles in the sky all together forming a triangle, and the closer I drove towards them the further away they got until they finally dissipated into nothing, but once they started going away it was very fast, much faster than any man made aircraft could travel. I kept my eye on the UFO’s until I could no longer see them. Blew my mind. THIS IS NOT A PRANK!!!!! I got home about 3 or 4 minutes after seeing them, and busted in the door and nearly yelled to my husband saying “you will never believe what I just saw!!!” Then we googled images that were as close to what I saw and surly enough there were a few images that were spot on to what I saw! Unfortunately since I was driving I did not get any photos, had I realized what was happening sooner I would have pulled over and gotten some.;36.8637168421052;-87.4862968421053
