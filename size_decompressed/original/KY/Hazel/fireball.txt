burnt orange fireball separates and becomes three fireballs;2003-04-23 21:42:00;10 minutes;burnt orange fireball separates and becomes three fireballs I hesitate to file this report since my last report was brushed off as the star Sirius (I still have the video, but I have no idea how to get stills off of it - neither of these reports is a joke, and I'm not a lunatic) however, based on the number of reports that are similar to this one in this region, I feel it necessary to file something (also, based on the fact that these sightings are occurring more frequently, I feel the need to file something).  Over the past year, I have seen frequent lights in the sky (burnt orange in color) which look like flares, but do not behave as such.  My son and I were coming home from town when we noticed another of the burnt orange lights/fireballs in the sky.  We turned off the main road and sat with our car facing it.  It came toward our car before it stopped (about 1/2 mile away).  It then got very bright and separated into 3 fireballs (all looked like flares - all hovered).  One of the lights began to slowly descend toward the ground, one began to slowly go higher into the air, and one of the fireballs stayed in the same spot.  I decided to go toward it so we could get a closer look.  As I headed down the road, the light that was higher than the other two shot up into the sky and disappeared, the one that was hovering and not moving quickly blinked out, and the other one descending rapidly descended to the ground and disappeared.  My son got scared, so we stopped and looked a little longer.  We saw no evidence of anything, so we went home. ((NUFORC Note:  The witness has offered to forward a VHS copy of his tape.  We will review it, and comment here, if we believe the footage may be UFO-related.  PD));36.5412;-88.3362
