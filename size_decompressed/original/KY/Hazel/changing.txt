morphing object emitting pulsating lights;2003-04-11 22:15:00;30 minutes;morphing object emitting pulsating lights My family and I were coming home from church late Friday night when my wife asked me what the light was in the sky.  We frequently see things in the sky around our home, so we stopped and watched it as we drove into the driveway.  It appeared as a bright star (larger than other stars in the sky), and it was emitting multicolored bursts of light (blue, green, red, and yellow).  It also appeared to be rotating.  We decided to go inside and get the binoculars and the digital camcorder.  The binoculars were no good, but the camcorder proved to be amazing.  I was able to zoom in on the object to get a better view.  Originally, it appeared as a bright light with a pulsating pink light in the center which would occasionally emit bursts of light in various directions.  For some reason, I got the idea to turn on the nightshot on the camera (which allows you to see in the dark).  When I did, the bright light changed, and I could see more detail.  It appeared as a rotating disk at first, and then it morphed into what appeard to be a jack (like you would see in a game of ball and jacks).  After morphing into the jack, the arms of the jack came together to make a sphere.  I got some very vivid video of the image ((NUFORC Note:  We will invite the witness to forward some stills from the video, but we are suspicious that the witnesses may have been looking at the star, Sirius.
