bright white light and craft hovering over the road;2005-03-12 22:35:00;5 min;bright white light and craft hovering over the road I was driving alone near Ledbetter Ky when I saw a bright white light in the distance near the Ohio River.  I kept my eye on it as I drove because I drive this route every night and had never seen this light before.  The light was no longer in view when I drove through the town. However, there was a craft hovering over the road at about the level of the tree tops.  I saw a blue light on the left and a red one on the right.  As I passed underneath I got the impression of a dark fusilage.  I immediately pulled into a parking lot and turned the car to watch.  From this angle I saw three lights.  A white light on each end and a red light in between and slightly above the other two.  The craft glided off.  I believe it realized that I was watching because it had been completely motionless as I approached and drove underneath it.  It did not appear to be a large craft.  Perhaps only about ten to fifteen feet across.  I did not hear an engine but my windows were up and the radio and heater were on in my car.  To be honest, if it hadn't been for the strange white light, I would have assumed it was a remote controlled toy.  Also Fort Campbell and the 101st Airborne are only a few minutes away by air.;37.0646;-88.469
