huge triangle shaped aircraft flying low that flew fast but made NO NOISE at all.;2009-12-04 05:00:00;3 seconds;huge triangle shaped aircraft flying low that flew fast but made NO NOISE at all. I have a huge bay window in my home with the blinds up so we can over look the land and neighborhood.  I had been up for about 30 minutes or so when an unidentified flying object flew passed my front bay window fairly quickly (about 50 yards away).  It was triangle shape with several lights (red & white).  I would have dismissed it as an airplane or some other reasonable explanation BUT it was flying way to low over the roof tops of the homes across the street and there was no engine noise or any other noise at all which prompted me to report this.  I looked out window it was already gone, but, I could see a light over a roof top that was moving along from roof top to roof top moving in the same direction as the aircraft.
