Slow moving, silent craft accelerated at an unbelievable angle and speed.;1970-10-10 19:00:00;3 minutes;Slow moving, silent craft accelerated at an unbelievable angle and speed. My father and I saw a slow moving blinking light in the sky approximately 1 mile from our house.  There was no sound.    After watching it for 2 or 3 minutes, whatever it was accelerated at an incredible rate and ascended at approximately an 80 degree angle until it disappeared.    The speed with which it took off and completely disappeared was unbelievable. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));37.1511;-83.7793000000001
