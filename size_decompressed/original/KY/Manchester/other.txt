Large light drops from the sky, no traces, police cover up.;2013-07-08 22:30:00;2 minutes;Large light drops from the sky, no traces, police cover up. Me and my girlfriend stepped outside for air, I looked up in the sky to see what looked like a very bright red star.  As I got her attention towards the star it began to flash, the flash had a huge diameter about as large as a dime.   I went inside and told my brother to come look, we all three stared at it as it began slowly moving down and getting bigger as it went.   Suddenly its speed picked up although still controlled and it went out of site, at this point I thought it was a meteor.   We got in the car an left to look for it, we saw no emergency vehicles or fire or anything else so we came back.   We then heard that there had apparently been a hot air balloon crash at the bottom of the hill we lived on.  This hot air balloon was the same thing we saw in the sky we went to the bottom of the hill, we saw several regency vehicles (multiple cop cars, fire trucks, and ambulances) all had their lights on but none had sirens.  We got to where we! had a clear view and there was nothing there, no hot air balloon, no fire, no trace of anything.  We ran up the hill an came back just a few later, it was probably 23:10 by now.  This time we drive by and there is once again no trace of anything, and now no emergency vehicles are left either.  The alleged hot air balloon wasn't on the news or anything else, there has been no mention of it.  I was a huge skeptic until this.   The light we saw was bright red, it would flash orange.  It was no hot air balloon.  If it was shouldn't it be on the news that a hot air balloon crashes at the bottom of a hill on a gas station?   On a side note, I had vivid dreams after the event.  At one point I looked at my body from a third person view.  I could see myself but could not control myself.;37.1511;-83.7793000000001
