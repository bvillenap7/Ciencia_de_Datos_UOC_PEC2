I went to the front of the house and saw a white cloud like object slowly descending.  I was astonished I ran in and got my girlfriend, her friend ((female name deleted)), and a couple that we are temporary custodial parents of their children they were visiting.  So 6 witnessed and I have video, pictures, and conversations of it.  I had a flash on my phone and when I flashed it it got brighter!  I still can't believe what I saw!;36.8625;-86.3625
