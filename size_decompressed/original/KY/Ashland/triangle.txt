I walked outside in my back top deck to smoke and i was looking at the stars and how beautiful they were and not a cloud in the sky.   I looked across the hill about north east of my house across the road and seen it.  It was a huge triangler shaped red light that was blinking really fast.  On the exterior of the object there were realy bright white lights around it also blinking really fast.   It sat over a house for around a minute and fouty-five seconds.  I ran inside the house to try to wake up my mom and she would not wake up, so I ran back outside to see if it was still there and it was gone.   I could not sleep the rest of the night and was scared to death.  I know for a fact that it wasn't a airplane, hellacoptor, or anything I have ever seen before.  I didn't believe in UFO's but i promise I for sure do now.  I know what I have seen and now i know there are others out there besides us.
