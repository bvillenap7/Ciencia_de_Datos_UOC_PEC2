I was compelled to look up at the top of the hill ( Ashland Ave Hill, the highest peak in the city of Ashland)and it drops out of thin air. It looks like a trianglular shaped pod with feet. Its body is shiny metal and it is mirror like ( it reflected the sun very brightly, as it was a beautiful brite sunny day. It went into the woods  in the hills as there are a lot of trees up there on the hill. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Star-like, red glow, zig-zagging in the sky.;2014-06-09 19:00:00;5 seconds;Star-like, red glow, zig-zagging in the sky. MONDAY, I BEGAN A MUCH ANTICIPATED 3 NIGHT TRIP WITH MY SISTER AND HER DAUGHTER TO GREENBO STATE RESORT PARK.  I RETURNED YESTERDAY (THURSDAY).  THE FIRST NIGHT I WAS ON THE BACK BALCONY JUST WATCHING THE SKY AND NOTED HOW BRIGHT THE MOON WAS THIS NIGHT. THE OTHER TWO CAME OUT AND WE WERE DISCUSSING WHAT THAT STAR WAS BELOW AND TO THE LEFT OF THE MOON.  I SAID IT WASN'T MARS (I HAD NOT CHECKED A STAR CHART) BECAUSE IT WASN'T RED.  AT THAT TIME, IT TURNED TO A REDDISH GLOW AND SHOT ABOUT 2 HAND WIDTHS UPWARD, WENT BACK TO A SILVER STAR COLOR, DID A 90 DEGREE LEFT JAG, THEN IMMEDIATELY TURNED REDDISH AGAIN AND ANOTHER JAG UPWARDS.  THEN IT DID A 90 DEGREE TURN RIGHT, STOPPED, CHANGED TO A SILVER AND WENT UPWARDS UNTIL OUT OF SIGHT!  THIS ALL OCCURRED IN ABOUT 3-4 SECONDS.  IF WE HAD NOT BEEN LOOKING, WE WOULD HAVE MISSED IT. I SPOKE TO A STAFF MEMBER AND WAS TOLD THEY SEE THESE ALL THE TIME.  THIS PLACE IS AWAY FROM CITIES AND MAKES STAR-GAZING MUCH EASIER WITHOUT ANY CITY LIGHTS CASTING GLOWS.  A VERY RELAXING PLACE TO GO.  WE WERE LATER THIS YEAR BECAUSE WE USUALLY GO BEFORE THE SUMMER SEASON AND AFTER IT.;38.4413413173653;-82.6886293413175
