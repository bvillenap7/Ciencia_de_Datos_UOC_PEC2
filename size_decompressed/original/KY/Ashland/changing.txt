Details - provide all the minor/major details  I was looking out the window of my 5th floor room in the Ashland Plaza hotel at a developing lightning storm to the right. My room faced the river. I am not sure of the orientation but that would be easy enough to determine  from a map of the area.  I noticed an object about the size of a small car floating in the air over the river – I’m not sure of the altitude, but it was a little less than twice as high as the bridge, at least from my perspective. It was moving to the left, in the direction of the wind, as I could tell from the flag in front of the courthouse across the street.  Although the wind was stiff, the object moved slowly in a controlled and deliberate manner, without the vagrant, flapping, unstable motion of, say, a plastic bag. Apparently, it made no sound. However, this hotel has windows that can't be opened, so that may not be verifiable.  It was black and roughly triangular in shape. It was either changing shape in motion or rolling somehow.  I thought it was a kite or a paraglider someone was flying off the back of a boat, as it was following the course of the river. That theory was shattered when it continued over the bridge. Shortly afterwards, it deviated away from the river, and me, and dwindled away to an invisible speck in the distance.  I’m not claiming this was an aircraft or anything else, BTW. It was an UFO at least as far as I’m concerned, if only for the simple fact that I could’nt identify it. Perhaps there were other witnesses or an explanation of some kind. If so, I’d like to know.;38.4413413173653;-82.6886293413175
Round object spotted in Kentucky sky.;2004-06-06 15:00:00;10+ minutes;Round object spotted in Kentucky sky. Looking toward the North on 06/06/04 at approximately 15:00 I noticed something in the sky moving slowly from East to West. I at first suspected that it was a Mylar balloon, but was very large. One side was black, the other was shiny (probably silver).  As the shape turned, it would disappear, so I suspect that it was very thin like a sheet of paper. The silver and black sides appeared to be round.;38.4413413173653;-82.6886293413175
