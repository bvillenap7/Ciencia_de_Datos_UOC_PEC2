Seen Glowing Orb Change Shape And Then Return To Previous Shape And Follow Our  Car;2001-05-23 22:00:00;30 minutes;Seen Glowing Orb Change Shape And Then Return To Previous Shape And Follow Our  Car I have to just guess at the dates because it happend a few years back, before I ever really believed in ufo's, but anyway I was out in the country with my friend at his grandmothers. We were playing outside baseball I believe whenever we happend to notice a bright glowing light over one of the hills, it didnt really have a color that I can describe and it was a little smaller than a golfball size, my friend said that there was a radio tower nearby and thats probably what it was. We kept playing our game and we ended it at about 10pm whenever we couldnt see anymore. We got in the car with his parents and began the trip back to his house. We drove for about 10 minutes whenever I happend to look out of the window and notice that I could still see the bright light. I told everyone in the car (including his mother and father) and me and him started to stare at it behind of us. What was weird about it was that no matter how far we traveled it never got any smaller. Then we came to a stop sign and I seen it ..this is hard to talk about its really freaking me out just remembering it, it makes my eyes tear up and I get goosebumps.. but it stretched from a circle to a long line in the sky the same color as the orb, this line was about 2 inches long and it just appeared as if the craft completely changed shape, it went past the car then returned to an orb shape and waited for the car to get ahead of it and started moving again we watched and watched until we went over a another hill and couldnt see it any more. We went back to his house and watched all night to see if we could see it but we never saw it again..Ive never really told anyone about it because it scares me to think about it even to this day.;38.4413413173653;-82.6886293413175
White Sphere in sky Over Ashland, KY 29th street BP.;2009-02-13 22:15:00;10sec;White Sphere in sky Over Ashland, KY 29th street BP. Was driving to a friends house from work, when in the distance, on the way to his house, I saw a Bright Sphere in the sky that was in place for about 5 secs and flew in excess of 100 mph and disappeared.;38.4413413173653;-82.6886293413175
Orb shaped, pulsating violet/white light going eastward, stopping then quickly out of site to the north.;2011-09-20 22:25:00;20 minutes;Orb shaped, pulsating violet/white light going eastward, stopping then quickly out of site to the north. Coming up US 23 in Ashland as I passed beneath the bridges I noticed a bright light in the sky.  It was mostly clear so I thought it was Polaris at first.  It was to my north.  But I saw the star at its usual position, 5-6 points up on the horizon and this was moving eastward less than 15 degrees southerly off due east.  I stopped along with another car at 23rd St and US 23.  They were an older couple that said they first saw the light at the Boyd/Greenup County line.  It started above the hills across the river in Ohio and traveled in a straight line to the plant that provides coke for the AK Steel Mill.  It paused for less than 45 seconds then shot northerly at an incredible rate of speed.   When it stopped it had to be less then 300 yards away over the Ohio River and I got a good look at its pulsating violet/white light.  Orb shaped, no doubt, the lights of the plant did not reflect off the object but did outline it.   I am pretty good at judging distance and the 300 yards could not be off by more than 10.  It did not pulsate in a regular pattern but one a few seconds later another then a rapid series of pulses.;38.4413413173653;-82.6886293413175
