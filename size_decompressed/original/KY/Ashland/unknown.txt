Observed a bright orange light, appearing to be at height of normal airlines operation, probably in the 15-30,000 feet range, but difficult to be sure.  It was traveling in a straight line, eastward, for about 3 minutes starting from where I first saw it to the West, until disappearing in the East, but not as far as the horizon. It was flame-like, much brighter than any aircraft lighting, steady, non-flashing, and no white, red, or green lights seen.  This was unlike anything I've seen in 50 years of studying the skies, both as one having a keen interest in astronomy, and in the 2300 hrs of flying US C-141 transport planes all over the world.  I was wondering at the time if it was an aircraft on fire, but if so, it would have crashed, but there have been no reports of anything like that.;38.4413413173653;-82.6886293413175
