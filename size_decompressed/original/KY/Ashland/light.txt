Once again, this appeared as a light with very long lines of light trailing it. Eliminated this as a reflection in that it was crystal clear and I could distinguish in my depth perception that this was well in front of me.  Trailing light appeared mostly white but had other colors mixed in.  The light crossed my view and turned heading past me on my right.  For a brief second it appeared the light was coming at that point from the electrical lines to my right, but moved to appear to stop atop the ridge paralleling the Ohio River.  At that point there appeared to be 4  distinct light from that point.  Then all traces disappeared.  I do not have any opinion 1 way or the other regarding ufos, but cannot explain what I saw.  I am 100% sure this was no reflection.  The object moved at a speed approximating that of a slow aircraft.;38.4413413173653;-82.6886293413175
Reddish orange light in the sky;2011-07-04 21:15:00;15 minutes;Reddish orange light in the sky We were sitting in our front yard watching of our neighbors set off fireworks when we notice an odd light unlike any of the fireworks seen.   We saw a reddish-orange light traveling horizontal in the sky in a way that no firework can possibly move and it produced no sound other than a very faint hum.  The light proceeded, stopped and hovered for a few moments and ascended vertically and disappeared.  Moments later a second light appeared and did the exact same movements of the first.;38.4413413173653;-82.6886293413175
