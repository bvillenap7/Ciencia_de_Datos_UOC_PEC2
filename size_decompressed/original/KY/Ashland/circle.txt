Three orange lights viewed over Kentucky;2008-07-05 22:00:00;5 Minutes;Three orange lights viewed over Kentucky My family and I were just finishing letting fireworks off and getting ready to go inside when my daughter asked us what was in the sky. We all looked up to see three orange colored lights floating across the northern sky. As the ball shaped lights moved across the sky towards us they slowly faded away one by one. They produced no sound and had a ball shape. There were six people who saw it and none of us had ever seen anything like this.;38.4413413173653;-82.6886293413175
