I work for the Fire Department in my hometown.  I had just got off work and had pulled into my driveway at home.  As I exited my car, I noticed a very bright white light in the sky. I stopped and began looking at this light, thinking it may be a medical helicopter taking off from a nearby helipad.   As I looked at this light it didn’t take long for me to rule out it being a helicopter.  What I was looking at was actually at least 3 very bright, white balls of light.  These balls of light looked to possibly be connected.  And directly above and below these balls of lights was either a long, thin stream of light or possibly some sort of lit up structure.  Sort of reminded me of a jack, like you would find in a children’s game.  Only it was a brilliant white color.  As I began to study this object, I began to notice that the balls of white light were actually rotating around fairly slow.  There was definitely no sound whatsoever.  I live out in a more rural area of the co! unty.  There was not a cloud in the sky when I observed this object.  I had a very clear, unobstructed, view of this object.  It was fairly high up in the sky, but not nearly as high as other objects such as stars or possible satellites.  Things such as that can definately be ruled out.   I continued to watch this object for 30 minutes or so.  During this time period the object never appeared to move up or down, or left or right.  It only sat in one spot and rotated.   After 30 minutes, I began to get cold, as well as needed to get some sleep.  So I went on in my home and went to bed.   Oh, one last thing... I did take a couple of pictures of this object with my cellphone.  But unfortunately you can’t make out any of the details of it.  All you can see is one bright white light in the photo.;37.6873;-83.9816999999999
