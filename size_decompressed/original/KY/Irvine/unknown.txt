Around midnight the electric had went out.  There had been storms the day earlier.  The next night the electric went out around 12:00am.  I think could have been off due to reparing electric poles ets. finishing up from the day earlier.    Around 2:00am there were thousand or more firefly lights all over the sky.  I looked out the window and a dim light was shining down on my home.  We are in the mountains and rural not close to the city.  The electric came back on around 7am in the morning.  7 hours and these lights were there till light 7:00am when electric came back on....;37.6873;-83.9816999999999
