At 10:45 I saw two red flying objects.  Slow moving from South to North.  They both were red with a bright light in the center along with bright red light running through the center.  I ran into the house to get phone and took pictures.  A few minutes later, I saw two more exactly the same and appeared to be traveling the same distance apart as the previous two.;38.0177999999999;-84.9320000000002
