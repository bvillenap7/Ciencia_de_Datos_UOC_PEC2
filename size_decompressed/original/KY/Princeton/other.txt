Extremely bright objects flying at high speed.;2014-09-23 19:30:00;5 minutes;Extremely bright objects flying at high speed. Driving home near N. Jefferson St, in Princeton, Ky., my daughter and I noticed 2 somewhat small, but extremely! bright, objects move into view from over us, and then ahead, at fast speed.  They were approximately 150-175 feet in elevation.  They were both bright white lights, with smaller red lights flashing at their rear (attached). At first I thought of gas powered RC helicopters as I used to know and enthusiast.  But then I realized they were faster and higher than I remembered seeing his fly.  And as they continued on in front of us, one just disappeared into thin air.  The other continued for over 1/2 mile, and that too wasn't what I remember compatible to the range of a RC air vehicle being from the operator.  When the second one got several blocks ahead of us, it also vanished.  (The total distance traveled by the second object, from first sight to last, was well over 1 1/4 miles. Both objects stayed on a straight West to East course (my guess by the street we were headed toward being one that runs to the North).  Neither object was ever obscured by buildings or trees, and neither just fell from the sky.;37.1217;-87.8618

Two family members first spotted it and called me outside to get my opinion of what it was. It was not a plane or helicopter, and was too high to be a drone. It wasnâ€™t a satellite, because it was to low for the light to have been reflection of the sun it was far too bright for reflected light, as well.;37.1217;-87.8618
