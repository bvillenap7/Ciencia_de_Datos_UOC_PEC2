While in my yard attempting to observe the Perseid meteor shower, I witnessed an unknown object move west to east across the sky. The object emitted one yellowish-white light approximately once every 5 seconds, with each emission lasting about a second. No beam or ground illumination was noted the object was too high in the sky to impact any ground activity.  When the light was not emitting, the object was essentially invisible in the night sky. At times, a very dim, tiny light, the same color of the emitted light, was noticeable. It is possible that the emitted light was rotating around the perimeter of the object, appearing smaller when on the far side, opposite my field of view.  The emitted light appeared much larger than any other stars or planets in the sky. The closest approximation I can make of its size as it appeared to me was about 25-30 percent of the size of a full moon, fully risen.  No sound was heard in association with the object. Other aircraft were observed around the time of the sighting, but none in time/spatial proximity to the unknown object.  The object followed a uniform path across the sky before passing out of sight to the east.;37.1217;-87.8618
