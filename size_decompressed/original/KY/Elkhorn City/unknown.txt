First noticed silvery brillant lights blinking upon a hillside. Seemed to be behind a tree. Light rose out of tree line, went right to other side of hill, the light when  moving had a red glow and was blinking. Then the light came back and traveled down by our house, then vanished. No sounds were heard, no motors, no engines. There was some heavy winds just before we saw these lights. Then we saw 2 more lights, one was above the other. They sat for a while, blinking silvery lights, then one went in the same direction as the first. After a short time the other did the same thing. There are dogs on both sides on the hills. The dogs on the side where the lights were first seen barked and howled constantly. The dogs on the side where the lights went only barked when the lights passed by them. There was a soft glow where we first saw the lights. After the 4th light left the glow was gone and the dogs stopped barking.;37.3131;-82.4129
