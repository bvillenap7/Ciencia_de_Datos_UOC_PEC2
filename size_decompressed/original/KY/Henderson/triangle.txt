Noticed a very bright light to the east headed toward my direction which was very low in the sky and seem to be hovering.   Kept watching it as I was driving and pulled over a few minutes later because it seemed to be coming directly toward us. got out to watch it was going very very slow to be a plane.  It went right directly above us at that point you could see one light in the front two lights in the back in the form of a triangle and there was no tail behind the two lights at all.   It seemed to be black because I can see the outline and I could tell that it was trying to her shaved because there is no tail nothing hanging out behind the two lights in the back and there was nothing extending past the front light.   It continued southwest just had a very very slow speed I could tell it was not a helicopter because there was no sound of a helicopter there was the sound of a turbine, but like I said, it was very very slow;37.825;-87.5655
