Green meteor?  That altered heading??;2001-10-05 21:00:00;20 sec.;Green meteor?  That altered heading?? Recently I read about the green meteor-like object streaking through the atmosphere in Raleigh, NC.  Strange that I observed this same exact thing about this time two years ago.  It came from the southeast making a gradual turn heading about 350*NNW.  It looked like a huge comet or meteor, surrounded by a green haze.  It left a greenish-white trail for miles.  No sooner than I stopped the car to observe it, I heard the dj on the radio announcing that several people were calling in reporting the same object.  That staion is in Owensboro, Ky.  Some people were calling from Evansville, IN as well.  It was presumed a meteor, but I've never seen a meteor alter coarse like that.  Nor move with such speed.  Just strange that I saw the same thing described here almost 2 years ago exactly. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));37.825;-87.5655
