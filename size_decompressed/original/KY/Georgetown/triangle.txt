UFO sighting in Kentucky 10/28/11.;2011-10-28 00:40:00;10 minutes;UFO sighting in Kentucky 10/28/11 Around 12:40 am, I spotted a large, bright white light in the SW sky.  It was very low and hovering just above the trees in one spot for over 5 minutes.  We live outside of town in a remote, treed area.  The light was self radiating and did not shine any beams toward the ground.  There were no blinking lights, such as an airplane or helicopter would have.  The light was bright, very large and low in the sky. I had a pair of binoculars near so I took a closer look.   The craft was shaped like a triange.  There was a row of white lights across the front and it had colors surrounding the craft.  The colors did not blink, just closely surrounded the craft.  I could only see the colors through my binoculars, not by naked eye.  I gave my binoculars to my husband who continued to watch the craft as it began to slowly move north, across the sky.  It was just above the tree line and was a very large craft.   As it moved past our house, he could see rows of diamond shaped patterns of! lights on the bottom of the ship.  It gained speed and moved away into distance.  We heard the sound of engines much like an airplane, but with a rumbling whine and wooshing sound.  We heard this sound for several minutes after the craft was out of sight. Our three dogs were very nervous and ran back and forth inside and then outside. Very upset. The entire incident took over 10 minutes.  I have never heard of a craft that large hovering for such a time and can't imagine the power it would take.  I also have never seen anything that radiated such a bright white light.;38.2131999999999;-84.5455000000002
