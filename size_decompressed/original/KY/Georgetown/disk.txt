3 small saucers follow 2 meters overhead in triangle formation;2020-03-02 22:30:00;2 minutes;3 small saucers follow 2 meters overhead in triangle formation This was in the Georgetown cemetery at night.  I noticed 3 plain disks directly above about 2 meters overhead while Iâ€™m walking.  They are about the same size and appearance as the convex bottom of plain white dinner plates.  Each is identical and maintains the same distance from each other in all maneuvers.  No sound, no lights, no markings. When I stopped walking and they hovered in formation overhead, bellow the trees.  I yell at it and it takes off to the north in consistent formation.  They were in an equilateral triangle there is a level of autonomy for each individual disk as it floats but the two follow the disk which points in the direction they were moving, like an arrow.  The formation pointed where it went. It lowered altitude towards eye level as it departed to reveal they were very thin and almost unnoticeable at horizon level.;38.2131999999999;-84.5455000000002
