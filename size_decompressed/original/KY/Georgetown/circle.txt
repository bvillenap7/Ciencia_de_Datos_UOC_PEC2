Two orange lights moving due south to due north combining as one then disappearing with no sound.;2014-01-06 19:00:00;30 seconds;Two orange lights moving due south to due north combining as one then disappearing with no sound. Peter, Upon hearing your comments on C2C with George the other night I have decided to share what I observed with you.  I am 57 years old and not a believer in UFO's.   Around 7:00 p.m I was bringing in firewood from my backyard to my house.  It was completely dark.  As I was walking up my driveway, I saw two lights approaching me from due south above my neighbor's roof line.   At first, I thought they were helicopters with their search lights on. This seemed odd because you always hear a helicopter before you see one.  The lights appeared to be about 500 feet, but ORANGE in color.  There was NO sound!  They were parallel in flight as they approached me.   Suddenly, the light on the right moved diagonally and fell in behind the other light.  They then traveled inline until the rear light collided, or was absorbed by the first.  When I turned my head to watch the singular light directly above my head it completely vanished.  This could not have been a Japanese lantern.  I told my wife and next door neighbor what I saw.  Neither believed me.   As I mentioned earlier, before this occurrence, I never witnessed or believed in UFO's.  Could this be some kind of military hologram?  I do not live in an area close to any Army or Air Force base.  I am only trying to find a rational explanation for what I saw.   Thank you for reading my account.;38.2131999999999;-84.5455000000002
Huge circular light formation.;2014-11-12 19:00:00;15 minutes +;Huge Circular light formation Noticed a large circular light brighten the sky in front of me while driving.  Suddenly, large white lights (balls) appeared in a circular formation.  The lights danced around and then went back to a large circular formation.  It began to slowly move away and I followed it almost to the next town (Lexington) after approx.  7-8 minutes beams of light came down from each ball of light.  Object was larger than all homes in route at leaste the size of a football field.  I saw other drivers brake and appear to notice it.  I tried my cells cam but of course it did not pick up anything.  Object was silent.  It just was there and gone,  Very strange.  The light beams that came down would move around the ground,  Become one and back to seperate beams of lights .;38.2131999999999;-84.5455000000002
