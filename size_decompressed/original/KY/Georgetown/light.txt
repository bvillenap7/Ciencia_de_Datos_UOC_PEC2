Orange streaks of light over Georgetown.;2014-01-12 17:15:00;45 minutes;Orange streaks of light over Georgetown. My wife and I were headed southwest on 62 between Leesburg and Georgetown when our son said he saw a falling star.  We looked and the object appeared to have a vapor trail that was bright orange so at first we believed it to be a plane.  As we continued to drive we noticed the craft was no moving enough to make a noticeable difference and the light trail was much shorter than what is typically seen behind an airplane.  We soon cleared the tree cover and noticed 3 objects to the direct north all flying diagonally in different directions at different altitudes.  When we made a more southern turn we noticed 2 more streaks of orange light parallel to one another almost in a direct southwest direction.  As we neared Georgetown we noticed one more streak above the Toyota plant but it seemed to be noticeable farther away.  By the time we got home we could no longer see any of the streaks they just seemed to have faded away.  The closest lights had what looked like ! a triangular vehicle in front of them.;38.2131999999999;-84.5455000000002
