2-red objects seen above Georgetown, KY.;2013-07-14 00:45:00;4-5 minutes;2-red objects seen above Georgetown, KY. Wife & I were sitting on our back deck last night, when I spotted a large, bright red object coming from the NE & proceeding to the SW.   No noise noted.  Object was very large and no other lights were observed.   After 2-3 minutes, it left our sight and after another 2-3 minutes, it was followed by another identical object traveling along the same route and heading.    Elevation was estimated to be around a 1000 feet and object thought to be from 3/4 to 1-mile away at its closest point.   Speed was much faster than a helicopter, but somewhat slower than a fighter jet.   At one point I though I detected a reflection of its light on some surface at the object's rear, but I could be 100% positive about that.   Most air traffic in our area is from N to S and the only E-W traffic we see is usually at very high altitudes.   Frequently, we see choppers from the KY Nat. Guard, but these were definitely not choppers.   Any ideas?   Objects were almost beautiful, but unnerving at the same time.;38.2131999999999;-84.5455000000002
