My daughter and I saw a suspicious aircraft while driving along I-24 west near Oak Grove, KY around 8:15 PM Tuesday, August 27th.  It was very large and moving at great speed.  It seemed to loop around quickly to change directions, then accelerated at a sharp angle as if trying to land quickly.  It disappeared.  The area in which it seemed to go down was too far from Fort Campbell to be near that airfield.  It had a V shape of bright white lights that seemed to be in a straight line sometimes depending on the angle.  At first I could only see the three lights at the outside angles forming a triangle.  I only saw white lights, no color.  The lights were equally spaced apart at least 6 or 7 in number.  I did not hear any sound of a helicopter or plane.  I’m guessing the distance to be less than a football field away from my car.  There were plenty of vehicles on the interstate including truck drivers.  No one even slowed down.  My daughter and I saw it simultaneously.  It seemed obvious that it wasn’t an ordinary airplane.  I wonder if it is some fancy military craft. Why would they fly it so low over civilian areas when there is miles and miles of government land at Fort Campbell? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicated a date in 2008.  We have amended the date above.
