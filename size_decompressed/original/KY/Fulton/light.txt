Me & wife were in the car on a back road on the way to visit some friends, when we saw a light over the treeline, so I stopped the car and got out expecting to hear a helicopter or something, but I did not. We watched this light for about 3 or 4 mins. Then it went from sitting in one spot to high speed travel in a flash and went out of sight. It was the fastest thing I ever seen, and never made a sound.
