I tried to record it with a regular digital camera but dont think it caught much because it was faint but at the moment they are still outside right now and have been for about 30 minutes and it is 10:36 pm central time tuesday august 14th 2012 .  The lights were whitish in color and decent in size , not large but not small . They made a big circle though, and not always a cirlce.  I just wish I could have gotten more evidence but I wasn't the only one to see it .;36.5477;-88.8723
