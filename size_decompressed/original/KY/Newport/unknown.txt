It was five till six in the morning and I happend to look out the window and I saw a very big bright white light hovering 5-600 feet above Newport.  It was still dark and the light coming from the object prevented me to see exactly what it was.   It did not move for about 15 minutes.  When it did start to move... the object shut it's lights out and I was no longer able to see it.   It would then reappear after a couple of minutes and everytime it started to move, it would shut its lights out.   The object would continue to do this for about 35 minutes, until finally it disappeared altogether.  I was extremely shaken by this... I've never seen any type of aircraft behave this way.;39.0453782894738;-84.4646901315788
