Witnessed luminous bright blue sphere descend into city of Newport, KY.;1999-03-23 21:30:00;5 minutes;Witnessed luminous bright blue sphere descend into city of Newport, KY. I was travelling northbound on I-471 towards Cincinnati and witnessed the sphere mentioned above travelling northwest. Sphere was bright blue and translucent. Size could not be determined, but smaller than an automobile. I first thought the light my be a reflection in my windshield I looked back to see if there were such a light and there was not.  I then thought it might be a small meteorite, but because of it's translucence and because I have witnessed several of these in my lifetime, I knew that it was not.  Further, it's trajectory was not consistent with all the other meteorites I had seen previously. Lastly, I can also state that the weather was such that I knew it was not ball lightning. The object travelled very slowly and as it started to descend over and into the city of Newport, the light simply blinked out--it was definitely the strangest thing I've ever seen.  It was definitely NOT a alien aircraft, but rather I believe some sort of atmospheric event that has yet to be explained.  I would compare it to the same sort of events that appear to precipitate seismic activity on the West Coast.  Of course, I can testify that Cincinnati doesn't have quite the same seismic activity as Los Angeles.  I was alone, so nobody can verify my claim.
