At least a mile long, grey, dark underside, cigar shaped object.  It looked as if it was cloaked inside a cloud.   It moved with the cloud as it went over the American electric power plant.  Moving slow to a south-west direction.   It moved off the cloud and without a sound or smoke shot toward the west and above the Earth's atmosphere from 5 miles an hour to 5,000 miles an hour.;38.1063;-82.6087
