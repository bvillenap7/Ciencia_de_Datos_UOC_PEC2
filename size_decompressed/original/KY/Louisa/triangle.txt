I was driving home from work on route 1690 south and driving into a curve and on the left side of the road the top of the hill was lite up, as  I got closer . I saw two bright light's that appeared to be headlights, I stopped my car.and got my cell phone to take a picture but the screen was black.  Then all of a sudden the object that I thought was a vechile shot across the sky, then suddenly came to a stop, like this object meant for me to see it, it somewhat appeared to be really close and started moving really slow, underneath the object that I saw there were red lights that outlined the object. It appeared to be somewhat triangular with a tail, then there were like yellowish orange light that blinked, in between the red lights, however It was something that  I never seen before in my life, I dont know what it was I just know that its was not a helicopter or an airplane, there were no sound at all. Then a car pulled up behind me and I had to leave..;38.1063;-82.6087
