As a preteenager us boys would hung out in a backyard to have UFO watches. This one night all of us (5) for one very brief moment in time. Saw 13 small white lights flying in a triangle pattern, zig-zaging across the sky. As they moved from horizon to horizon across the sky. Less than 5 seconds. These lights never broke formation. These lights where traveling at a very high rate of speed. I would estimate that these lights where at least 50,000 feet in the air. The speed of these lights, plus the hard, sharp turns of the zig-zag formation. Truly convinces me, that what we saw that night. Was not part of this earth. I know this could be easily passed off as kids with over active imaginations. But, we truly saw something that night. A few years latter. I came across a picture of what we saw. This UFO book described it as the Lubbock Lights I showed this picture to my buddies. We all agreed that this is what we saw.;37.7529693898656;-87.1329000000007
Series of white and blinking colored lights flying around the sky.;2006-09-15 21:00:00;20 minutes;Series of white and blinking colored lights flying around the sky. I was outside gazing at the stars until at a left corner of my eye came a hovering red and blue blinking light that mostly looked at a star moving very slowly from behind the trees 30 feet away from me. I was like I never seen anything quite like this before. A moving star? I assumed it was a UFO or something. Couldn't hear no engine, it was only pure silence. I followed it by foot. Another minute later hear comes a another one that flew very close by. The right side had a light that wasn't blinking on the right and the other one on the left was. People wouldn't believe me if I told em' what it was striaght up so I kept it to myself. I did see the same blinking red and blue light standing still like it was a star in the sky. It stood there for at least 10 minutes. The third one went at a very odd random speed, It was only a blinking red light-zizzaging into the horizon to my south and west. It looked it was about to land but remained above ground at all times. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

Bright light passing over slowly overhead to the south then dissapears slightly north.;2007-12-03 17:03:00;15 seconds;Bright light passing over slowly overhead to the south then dissapears slightly north. Me and my grandad just walked from the house towards the car sitting in the yard on that chilly evening. I happened to gaze at the sky then I seen something bright passing really close over me. I almost assumed it was a jet but then when I observed it more closely, it was more starry-like but more closer than ever. I didn't even hear no sound. That evening there were mostly cloudy skies but there was some clearing left over. As it went overhead, I continued to look at it until as it headed north, it changed to a reddish color then disappeared. I know that south of us is the airport but I knew right then and there that wasn't a airplane or a jet. I tried to tell my grandad what I seen and he laughed it off like I was joking. I told him I seen something weird but he told me I probably seen a plane. I dropped the subject instantly then decided to keep it to myself.

Light or orb observed during sunrise.;2008-05-23 05:33:00;20 Seconds;Light or orb observed during sunrise. I woke up around 5:30 that morning to use the bathroom, but before I did that I happened to look out the window observing the clear weather, and the dawn breaking out behind me(my window faces the western horizon).  I happened to observe a non-blinking light/orb passing slowly overhead of me, with no sound, it was almost too low to be a jet.  This is my fifth sighting so far and yet they're quite similar in previous cases. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

Reddish Orange Orbs, Very Large Moving Slowing Across Owensboro, KY sky;2011-07-02 20:15:00;about 3-4 minutes;Reddish Orange Orbs, Very Large Moving Slowing Across Owensboro, KY sky On Saturday night, July 2, 2011, at approximately 8:00 or 8:15 p.m. I was driving back to my mother's from picking up some fast food. I was staying with her over the 4th of July weekend.  I saw 3 reddish-orange orbs.  They were very large.   At first I thought they were from cell phone towers, so I did not think too much of them. As I mentioned, they were very large and they were not blinking as cell phone towers normally do.   So I thought I'd pull over on the side of the road in her neighborhood and see if they moved.  To my surprise, they were moving very slowly across the sky.  The lights were sort of oval in shape.  The center was primarily reddish orange but there was a whitish or lighter color outside of the orange color.  There was no noise whatsoever.   I watched them for approximately 3 minutes as they moved across the sky.  A car pulled in the neighborhood, so I needed to move my car.  When I finally reached my mother's house I couldn't find them again. I have a keen interest in UFO's and sightings, and I tried to think of everything I could to explain what I saw.  The lights did not behave like traditional air craft lights.  They were much to big and they were not blinking.  Plus, I believe that aircraft would've moved faster across the sky.  They were not lights from a cell phone tower or from a satellite or star.  I'm telling you, these lights were very large.   I wasn't going to report this until I spoke with my father today.  He said that he saw something similar last night in his area of town.  Apparently, he was watching some fireworks with his wife and neighbors and they saw them as well.  He said he even said, Hey, do you see that? to his neighbor about them.  That's when I knew this was a significant event and that I needed to say something.  Be it extraterrestrial, military, or some other phenomenon, something out of the ordinary was going on that night.;37.7529693898656;-87.1329000000007
Red and white pulsating motionless orb emitted a single bright sparking flash remained for a few minutes then disappears.;2013-05-13 20:06:00;3:00;Red and white pulsating motionless orb emitted a single bright sparking flash remained for a few minutes then disappears. A bright red light that faded and change to white intensified then faded and change to red slowly changing back and forth every second or so, predominantly red.  It was as bright as a radio tower light but was high in the sky and motionless and in a spot that I know no such tower could exist.  There was a spark of white light to the right of it that lit and faded away as the red orb continued to pulse motionless.  After about 3 minutes it faded motionless from site.;37.7529693898656;-87.1329000000007
Two lights hovered in daylight sky over Owensboro, KY.;2017-09-30 14:00:00;30 minutes;Two lights hovered in daylight sky over Owensboro, KY. At 2:00 p.m. today my friend called me on the phone to tell me to go outside and look just below the sun.  I went outside to look.  I had to cover the light from the sun with my hand to see them, but when I did, I saw two shining lights in the sky.  They appeared as stars would appear in the night sky, except this was broad daylight.  They didn't move at all, and stayed equidistant to each other the whole time.  I don't know how long they had been there before my friend saw them and called me.   I watched them for at least a half hour.  They seemed to drift slightly to the left of the sun a little, but they stayed in the same position to each other the whole time.  They never moved.  They looked like stars in the daylight sky.   I've never seen anything like it before.;37.7529693898656;-87.1329000000007
