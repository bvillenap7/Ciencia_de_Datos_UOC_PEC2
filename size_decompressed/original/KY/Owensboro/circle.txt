fast moving red light;2000-09-16 23:30:00;2 minutes;fast moving red light We saw two small red fast moving circular objects approxiamately 5000 ft above us in the clear night sky.  One was moving northeast, and moved very fast in a cursive e direction, then made a rapid turn south.  Both moved like a laser light would, but we are positive that these were not laser lights.  Then both objects disappeared over a building very quickly and did not appear again.;37.7529693898656;-87.1329000000007
