It was a nice night in mid october 1993, a friend and i were just out for a ride to enjoy the autumn air in his car, which was a convertible by-the-way.  We pulled over and had parked in a popular parking spot in a small town called stanley  which is placed right on the ohio river.  We had been parked maybe 5 minutes  and i was resting my head back on the headrest  watching the night sky over the ohio river looking in  the direction of north-west..of this I am positive.  I saw a glowing round light  that seemed to dim and bright in a repeating pattern. The color of this light was whiteish to light bluish in color.  I thought i t was a plane at first  but soon realized  by its movements  that it couldn't be.  Then i said to myself  it is a helicopter... but soon realized  that the distance it was covering  in what seemed like a millioneth of sec  that it wasnt.  I told my friend to look  and he saw it too.  I don't know how to describe it... but this object seemed to be reading my mind  moving in directions that i was telling it to go.  It took 10 minutes for me to KNOW  it wasn't anything manmade  it moved to quickly and efficiently... i had treetops on the opposite side of the river to base distance on  it was not quite as far away as the stars  but not as low as conventional aircraft fly, but way above the treetops. We watched for another 20  minutes or so, before i got scared and asked to be taken home, I also had him close the top on the convertible.   Once home in thruston southeast of where i first spotted the object, I looked in the sky and saw it again but more to the southeast of me  and over a rural area  not the river anymore...  it was still pretty far away...  I was spooked  told my friend bye and went in the house.   I went to a psychiatrist over this  who dismissed it and tried to put me on medicine for it... i found this funny....and maddening.   But 9 years later in late january of 2002 I saw the same object again. I was married at the second sighting it was like 4 am in the morning  and my husband was leaving for work. we live in a small community less than a 1/4 of a mile away from the ohio river  and it seemed to be in the location  that i saw it in 9 yrs. previously.  I was very scared  locked the house down made sure all blinds were closed.  I don't know how describe the feeling of it being able to sense my thoughts.  I told a fieman friend of mine about it several hours later  and he said not to feel strange others have seen these things.  Incedentally i called the airport after the first sighting in 1993 the next morning  but they had no reports of anything strange. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We believe that celestial bodies would have to be ruled out, before we could conclude that the objects spotted were UFO's.  We do not know what the witness observed.

slow moving ball of light (almost white with a little yellow) 10 feet off ground flew over my shoulder at night;2011-04-30 02:00:00;10-15 seconds;Slow moving ball of light (almost white with a little yellow) 10 feet off ground flew over my shoulder at night I live in an apartment complex for senior citizens  and handicapped adults. I was sitting outside my apartment in a chair facing north about 2 AM on April 30, 2011.   A round ball of light about the size of a hubcap went over my left shoulder about 10 feet off the ground.   The ball of light moved north in front of me down the sidewalk for about 50 yards. [This took between 10 and 15 seconds]   It went between two apartment buildings, then it just disappeared. The ball of light was pretty bright, almost white with a little yellow in it. I remember feeling a sence of peace during this occurance.;37.7529693898656;-87.1329000000007
Orange, bright, round object flying just above tree line...;2012-06-24 23:00:00;2 minutes;Orange, bright, round object flying just above tree line... Took my dog out back to do her business. Saw something in the sky that looked unusual. VERY bright orange ball that left an &quotaura&quot of light behind it as in moved rather slowly and just above the tree line. I had NEVER seen anything this unusual in the skyâ€¦ Went online a few days later and found that MANY people across the globe have witnessed what are seemingly the same things, or at least sounds that way by reading their descriptions. I was able to take a couple of pics with my i-phone. Whats REALLY going on??????;37.7529693898656;-87.1329000000007
