3 large orange balls in the formation of a triangle.  ((anonymous report));2019-09-13 19:00:00;1-2 minutes;3 large orange balls in the formation of a triangle This weekend is the towns air show, so I happened to look out the window to see if they were doing any night training because my window faces the airport.  I saw a triangle formation of 3 large orange balls in the sky.  I stared at them and told the other person “I have no clue what I am looking at.”  So as she came over to look, the one ball job just fades out quickly.  So now the two balls are sitting there, haven’t moved at all, till the one starts doing tight loops and spins around.  We decided to go outside to watch them, and I grabbed my phone.  Got out there, and they were gone.;37.7529693898656;-87.1329000000007
