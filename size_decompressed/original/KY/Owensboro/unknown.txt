Star like object moving over Owensboro, Kentucky.;2011-08-12 21:00:00;5 minutes;Star like object moving over Owensboro, Kentucky. I went for my evening run.  I started out facing south and then ran east. When I started, I looked up at the moon.  The moon was full and very bright. The moon was located directly south of my location.  I noticed a very bright, star like object just below and to the left (East) of the moon.  As I ran east, the object was moving northeast. There was no sound coming from the object.  No blinking lights, just a consistent, bright white light. There did appear to be a red like light on the top, left side, or top front, hard to tell.  After about a minute or two, I turned south, the object was now on my left side. It appeared to be getting closer. It also appeared to be drifting in an erratic pattern, not in a straight line, moving very slowly.  At one point I thought I noticed what appeared to be several directional lights. During my observation of the object, I had stopped and started my run several times. At one point I lost the object behind some trees.  I looked ar! ound the sky, more to the northwest and suddenly saw the object streak across the sky, in a straight line, moving south.  I have never seen anything move that fast. The object went from a slow drift, to disappearing for a few seconds, to a fast, bright streak across the sky. I was so overwhelmed from what I witnessed that I screamed out, almost uncontrollably, Oh my God, what was that!.  I also suddenly had a strong urge to cry. Sounds corny, I just want to give you an accurate description of what I saw and how I felt.  I will never forget the experience.
