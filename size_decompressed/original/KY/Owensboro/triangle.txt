The lights were of an odd color, a pale yellow would be the best way to describe them.  After a period of about 50-60 seconds, I lost sight of the object due to it heading one way and myself heading another.  As I was in a moving vehicle, I cannot state whether or not the object made any noise.  It was not very large so I suspect that it was at an altitude of several thousand feet.. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));37.7529693898656;-87.1329000000007

Saw a white, luminous upside down triangle in a clear, blue, cloudless sky south of city. We were driving south and object appeared to be stationary. As our direction changed to the east, the object started moving very rapidly, moving from west to east. We looked at object through different windows and at one time with window down.
