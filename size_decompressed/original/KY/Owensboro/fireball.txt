Sighting of Unusual Flaming Object in Night Sky, East Daviess County, Kentucky, 7:52pm CDT, September 13, 2013;2013-09-13 19:52:00;15 seconds;Sighting of Unusual Flaming Object in Night Sky, East Daviess County, Kentucky, 7:52pm CDT, September 13, 2013 Sighting of Unusual Flaming Object in Night Sky East Daviess County, Kentucky September 13, 2013  I saw this tonight at 7:52 pm CDT in the sky from eastern Daviess County, KY, September 13, 2013.    I am curious if anyone else reported seeing this.  It looked like a big ball of flame just below the moon and drifting across sky in a southwestern direction until I lost sight of it behind some pine trees.  Very amazing!   I took this picture with my cell phone.  My husband observed it with me and took several pictures with a digital camera, but the one on my phone is best.  (His are not steady).  I really am anxious to know what this was, or if it was seen by others.  -  Thank you.;37.7529693898656;-87.1329000000007

Orange fireballs over Owensboro, KY;2014-07-03 21:00:00;several minutes;Orange fireballs over Owensboro, KY July 3, 2014.  Driving down bypass Owensboro, KY, I spotted 4 reddish, orange objects sort of stacked upon one another.  They appeared motionless.  Pointed it out to the driver, but he didn’t really pay attention as he was driving.  Less than 5 minutes later we had reached our destination.  I spotted another of these objects. This time the driver saw it, too. He said it was probably a tower. I told him it wasn't a tower. It wasn't blinking and it was orange, not red.He looked around at some other towers and agreed what we were seeing was NOT a tower. It finally just disappeared.  Other people seemed to be watching it, too.   Later from inside of our destination, we could see more of these objects.  They appeared further away than the one we had seen when we went in.  They were moving from the NE to the SW.  There were fireworks that night, but these were not fireworks nor were they Chinese lanterns. I have hesitated all these months reporting this as I’m sure people would think we were crazy.  But we both saw them.

Numerous orange fireballs spotted;2014-07-04 21:00:00;~30 minutes;Numerous orange fireballs spotted. July 4, 2014. While watching fireworks, at approximately 9:00PM, my friend and I noticed a bright orangish, reddish, yellowish object moving in a strange pattern across the sky, looked like a fireball.  It started at what seemed a fairly low altitude and then ascended toward the moon, disappearing just beyond the moon.  We then saw another, come in from a different direction, but looked and acted similarly to the first, then another, again looked and acted similarly to the other two.  This lasted approximately 5-10 min.   We then saw one much lower than any of the previous three had been, appeared to be barely above the street lights.  It was coming from the south, moving north.  It seemed to be coming directly toward us, then arced up toward the moon and disappeared before getting as high the moon.  We saw approximately 10-12 of these follow the exact same path.  Probably 30-45 seconds apart.   Other people appeared to be viewing them as well.  My friend tried to take pictures with phone, but they did not show anything that was discernible other than the moon in one of the pictures.  We did not talk to any of the other people. None of the objects blinked or made any sounds.  They weren’t fireworks.  They did not look like any aircrafts I have ever seen flying before except the ones we also saw the previous night in a different part of town.  Neither my friend nor I have seen any since.

Red orange objects seen flying over Owensboro, KY.;2014-12-06 07:30:00;10-15 minutes;Red orange objects seen flying over Owensboro, KY. Saw 9 fireball type objects flying over Owensboro.  They appeared red on the top and glowed orange on the bottom half.  They were coming in from the N.E. (from the Rockport In. area). They crossed the Ohio into east Davies's Co. and turned in a big arc continuing off to the west. We noticed that they seemed to be dripping fire (sparkler like).  They were traveling very slow and in single file.   We went outside to watch and there was no noticeable sound coming from the objects.;37.7529693898656;-87.1329000000007
Large, silent fireball speeding toward earth, until I lose sight of it when it went behind some distant trees.;2016-05-03 23:45:00;1 second;Large, silent fireball speeding toward earth at an angle until I loose sight of it when it went behind some distant trees. I was driving home from a late movie.  It was me and my 7 year old daughter.  She wasn't looking in the same direction as me, so she didn't see it.  If I would have blinked, I wouldn't have seen it either.  It lasted only a split second.  I saw a large fire ball with a long flaming tail trailing off the end, zooming toward the earth at about a 60 degree angle.  It was silent, and I lost sight of it when it went down behind some trees in the distance.  I've never seen anything like it before.;37.7529693898656;-87.1329000000007
