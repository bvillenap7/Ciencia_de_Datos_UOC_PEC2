Flashes of lights from what looks like stars.  ((NUFORC Note:  Twinkling stars??  PD));2009-08-21 20:34:00;20 minutes;Flashes of lights from what looks like stars The sky was extremely clear and I had only looked at the stars through a telescope a few times.  I was curious about the recent crash on Jupiter.  My step dad has a old telescope and we decided to get it out.  By the way I do not believe in UFO's and I am an elementary school teacher who has never saw anything out of the ordinary in the night sky.  While we got jupiter in focus we noticed a couple of its moons and could faintly see a couple rings.  We sit in the lawn chairs and began to talk at how clear the sky was and all the stars we could see.  As we talked my step dad asked me to look at a group of stars and pointed for me to look at the bright one in the center.  It was not Jupiter.  As we looked at it it flashed like a camera had just took our picture.  It never moved and only took 3 seconds to dim again.  This happened 3 more times during the night to other faint stars we looked at.  I don't know what it was, if it was other objects crashing into eac! h other.  I just know it was wierd to see.  Like someone was taking our picture from space. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to provides no contact information.  PD));37.2041;-87.183
