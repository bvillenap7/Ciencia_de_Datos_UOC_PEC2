Oval/Almond shaped craft, very bright moving quickly then slowly.;2012-05-28 18:00:00;5 - 10 minutes;Oval/Almond shaped craft, very bright moving quickly then slowly. We were swimming in the back yard when I jokingly mentioned a small craft in the sky.  It was moving rather quickly at first and then it seemed to slow down a considerable amount.  Everyone else saw it too.  It became a lot less funny and more serious when all of us realized we were looking at a UFO. Before yesterday they were just a joke, ya know?  It disappeared after five or ten minutes. An unmarked plane came through within seconds of it disappearing, and it was even more obvious that what we'd seen before was NOT a plane.  It was oval/almond shaped, very smooth around with no sharp edges or corners and fairly bright, it looked as though the sky around it had a halo effect and was slightly darker than the rest of the sky.  I have a picture I took on my iPhone where you can see the light from the craft, but not make out the craft itself because of the poor quality.;37.2041;-87.183
