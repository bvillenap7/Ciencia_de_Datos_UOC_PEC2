Strange orange light/craft hovering noiselessly overhead.;1995-12-15 20:50:00;Less than 5 minutes;Strange orange light/craft hovering noiselessly overhead. At the time stated, I was outside on a clear night walking our dog on our property.  As I was standing in our field, I got an odd sensation and for whatever reason, looked directly above me.  There was an orange sphere/circle over my head hovering noiselessly.  It seemed to be quite low in the sky.  As I stood there for about 30 seconds staring at it, it began to stretch and elongate to a cigar shape and then took off to the south at an incredible speed which made it seem to stretch even farther.  Almost an effect similar to blurring. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));37.8503;-86.7638
