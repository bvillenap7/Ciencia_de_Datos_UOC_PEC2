Stick Objects;2003-06-20 22:00:00;SECOND;My daughter and I was going to town on our rd.Joe Powers when out from the ditch in about 2ft. of weeds in the flash of my eyes a object jumped out from the dith and with the bat of my eyes in went back into the ditch without turnning around. I slammed on my brakes thinking it might be a animal, but I could hardly speak to my daughter because I didn't know how to describe it to her. The only way I can tell you what it was is it looked like a stick dog. It had no skin or hair just sticks shaped into a dog about 2 foot tall,and no I am not crazy!Now get this a friend of mine just moved here and 2 weeks ago we were coming home from town and it was dark as we were talking I was listening and looking at her when all at onced she hit her brakes and said oh my God I thought she almost hit a deer and she said no it was something that leaped across the road so fast that all she could tell was it was made of sticks. I then told her what had happened to me just a year back. Then I seen on my pc that somewhere in another state a party was ran out from what appeared to be stick people. Now I am a true believer I saw what I saw. I am 56 years old and have no reason to tell such childish stories.I would love to hear if others may have seen stick objects no matter what their shape was.;37.8503;-86.7638
