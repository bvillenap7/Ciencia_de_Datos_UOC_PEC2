One actually flew over our apartment building.  They were moving in a westward direction.  Sometimes it was like they were playing with each other.  It would look like they were going to crash into each other and then they would not at the last second.  They moved very fast out of my field of vision in 10 seconds.  We were not believers until we witnessed this.  There were probably 100 lights.  It was eerily silent.;37.6450999999999;-84.7703000000001
Two unusual bright lights seen from passenger jet that just strangely winked out.;2016-11-16 20:30:00;3 minutes;Two unusual bright lights seen from passenger jet that just strangely winked out I was in a window seat 10A on Delta flight 3760 from Minneapolis, MN, to Knoxville, TN.  We had just begun our descent over southern Kentucky, when I  saw two bright lights, slightly off white, over the left wing at what I would guess would be 1-2 miles away..   At first, I thought it could be two other aircraft with their approach light on.  However, there were no red or green navigation lights and the brightness and separation did not change over time.  The two lights appeared to track along at the same speed as our aircraft.   After watching these lights for about two minutes, one of the lights disappeared instantly.  I watched the second light and after about 10 seconds it also disappeared instantly.   I've flown quite a bit and seen many aircraft and navigation lights and these did not look like anything I've ever seen.  As I exited the aircraft, I asked the pilot if he observed any unusual lights out the left side of the aircraft during the descent.  He said no and ! that there are a lot of lights out there.;37.6450999999999;-84.7703000000001

At first I thought it was military aircraft but then noticed that the lights were steady and no signs of strobes. I quickly ran into the house to grab my cell phone to record video but my wife called me right as I was trying to film them.  As I looked up the lights were dimmed out and you could only see a real faint white glow of the craft. They were moving steady and average speed of planes from Harrodsburg, KY, towards Junction, KY. NW to SE. I watched them until I  could no longer see them any longer.  No sound what so ever. Clear skys.;37.6450999999999;-84.7703000000001
