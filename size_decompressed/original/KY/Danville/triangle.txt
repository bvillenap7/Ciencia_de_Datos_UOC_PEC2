triangular object with lights in each corner hovering over a school campus seen by wife and I;2001-11-14 20:00:00;5-10 minutes;triangular object with lights in each corner hovering over a school campus seen by wife and I My wife and I were returning home from picking up our daughter from the babysitters house and were passing by a the Kentucky School for the Deaf  on south second street  when we noticed something out of place in the sky.  My wife is a nurse and I have a BA from Centre College so I believe that we are both credible.  It was a clear night sky with little or no moon which made the object stand-out even more.  The best way to describe it was triangular in shape with lights at each corner.  The reason we noticed it is that it was offset from the night sky.  It appeared to be hovering and rotating in a counter-clockwise direction.  The lights were not flashing but were steady.  I was driving and slowed down to get a better look but our view was soon obstructed.  We continued home (about 3 miles) and when we got out of the car we could still see the object.  I went inside to get a camera while my wife took our daughter inside, but by the time I found our camera and got back outside it was gone.  We can both honestly say that it was not a plane, helicopter, weather balloon, swamp gas (there are no swamps here), or anything else that belonged in the night sky.  By the process of elimination it was an unidentified flying object. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));37.6450999999999;-84.7703000000001
