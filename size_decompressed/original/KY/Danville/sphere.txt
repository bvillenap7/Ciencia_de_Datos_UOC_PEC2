Bright org flys by me.;2012-04-10 18:00:00;~1 second;bright org flys by me I was driving home from work from Lexington Ky to Danville Ky on highway 27,  I was going around 60 mph when to my right, another words the passenger side of my vehicle, I saw a orb, about the size of a truck tire, and it was bright orange, almost red, fly past me at ungodly speeds, if i had to guess i say 400mph, my eyes focused on it till i lost sight of it which wasn't long, maybe 5 seconds......  I heard/saw stories on TV, of people seeing this stuff, but i thought they were all crazy people, till i saw it, and this changed my views on everything, I didn't see a actual craft, but it was just like a ball of orange bright light, and it was beautiful, I no this thing wasn't man made, nor fireworks, nor a meteor shower. this thing was not from here,  it stayed at the same height off the ground which i say was 50ft and rose up to go over a hill and i lost sight of it.......very strange.... just wanted to post this due to it has been on my mind every since it happ!
