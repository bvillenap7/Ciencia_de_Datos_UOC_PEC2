I saw a circle of light, just before the sun was up, in the eastern sky, south of where the sun would rise.  It caught my eye because it was perfectly round and not moving, bigger than any star, like a tiny moon. I got out my binoculars for a better look.  Perfect circle, looked like a dandelion with points of light over an open framework.  It did not move.  I watched for 10 minutes and then it sort of folded over and vanished. Just disappeared, no trail, no streak, just gone.  Took a photo with iPhone.  In the photo it shows a circle within a circle.;37.6450999999999;-84.7703000000001
