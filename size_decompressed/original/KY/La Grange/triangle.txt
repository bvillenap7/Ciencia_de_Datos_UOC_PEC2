I’m a delivery driver . I was on a delivery when I got in my car I noticed a set of lights that were similar to airplane lights . I noticed whatever it was was at a really low altitude . I continued to drive and I got to a stretch of road where there isn’t much light and I noticed this “plane” was triangular shaped because the dark part was so dark it contrasted against the dark sky. It had lights on all sides and they were slowly pulsating on and off . It wasn’t making sound and it was slowly cruising at the same low altitude. It was also kind of making circles and turns at the same low altitude in a swift smooth manner . Nothing Ive ever seen before . I followed it for about 2 minutes and it then begin to pick up speed and I lost it after that.;38.4029;-85.3927999999999
