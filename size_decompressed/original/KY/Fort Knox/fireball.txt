i saw a large fireball falling to earth in the early morning hours on  Oct.11,2003 in Kentucky;2003-10-11 07:00:00;2-3 seconds;i saw a large fireball falling to earth in the early morning hours on  Oct.11, 2003, in Kentucky A friend and i were at the Knob Creek gun range located between Shepardsville and Fort Knox Kentucky on the morning of Oct.11, 2003 waiting in the parking area for the range to open, as i was looking across the parking area towards one of the small hills i saw a large fireball falling and disappearing behind the hill i had been looking at, as i had the windows up i heard no sound nor did i see any explosion or smoke as there should have been on impact especially at the speed it was coming down, my friend did not see it as he was looking in another direction and by the time i started to say something it was already out of sight, thinking back on how far away it may have been i would have to say no more than 3-4 miles. Picture wise if you can imagine a walnut totally inveloped by flames thats how i would describe it. So far i have not seen or heard any reporting on this sighting but i do know what i saw and am wondering who else may have seen it.;37.8919;-85.9628
