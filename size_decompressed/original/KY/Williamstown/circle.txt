Sitting on my porch, looking at the night sky, facing south.  I was startled by what looked like a bright orange ball surrounded in a distortion appear and immediately fly west at an extremely fast speed out of sight.  It appeared to be a few hundred feet up and a few hundred feet out from me.  The entire event was silent.  When the object first appeared it seemed like a sudden explosion into existence before flying off.  It was almost like a bright, up close, silent comet.;38.6297;-84.5731
