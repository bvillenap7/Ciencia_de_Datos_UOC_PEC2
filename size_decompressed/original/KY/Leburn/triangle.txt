I had to take out the garbage.  I walked out the door and immediately heard a buzzing noise. At fisrt I paid no attention thinking it was most likely a bee.  It got louder, I looked up seeing a bright triangular craft. It had 4 large red orbs with peachy colored connecters. I ran to the garbage cans.  It moved across the sky musch faster than any plane I have seen.  It put out no exhaust.  I ran to our porch got my Mom, took her out, it was gone.  There was also sort of like fog surrounding the craft.;37.3794;-82.9523
