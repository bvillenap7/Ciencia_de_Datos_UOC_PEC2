4 lights speed across the sky in a way that planes can't.  ((Starlink satellites??));2021-03-08 22:40:00;<10 seconds;4 lights speed across the sky in a way that planes can't Four lights arranged in a line appeared to be attached to some rigid body that I couldn't see. The spacing of the lights and the speed with which it crossed the sky made it look like an extremely low b2 bomber but it made no noise at all. It appeared overhead because a house was blocking my view of half the sky. It was either close and fast or it was far and EXTREMELY fast. Halfway through it's flight, the lights tilted as if it were a banking jet however the orientation of the lights didn't make any sense as a man made plane. Before it reached the horizon, it faded into darkness instead of becoming obstructed by objects near the horizon.;38.2272333333333;-84.8698027777779
