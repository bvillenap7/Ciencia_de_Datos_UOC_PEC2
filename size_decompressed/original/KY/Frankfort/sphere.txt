Small round orange object appeared to hover to the west of Rt. 127 on the north side of Frankfort.  We stopped our car to get a better look and within about 30 seconds, it began moving south with no apparent sound.  We got back in the car to follow it.  Within a few seconds, it was gone.  It seemed to disappear on us. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));38.2272333333333;-84.8698027777779
Round, orange-redding solid light, no blink moving smoothly fast and up No sound.;2014-07-28 22:27:00;2 minute;round, orange-redding solid light, no blink moving smoothly fast and up No sound Five round lights formed in a triangle formation, two disappeared out of nowhere, the remaining three moved up up up until we could not see them.   We were driving in our neighborhood and stopped and watched, a neighbor also came outside because his dog was barking and he asked us what are those, are they helicoptors?  My son said we don't know.  They were round emitting a orange-reddish glowing solid light no blinking at all. Very intriguing.

Before, and during lights behind the clouds that really didn't seem to move so I thought ok it's the moon but it was 3 different distinct light's. I watched them disappear in a swirl kinda like pattern in front of me m I look and the sphere is gone as well.  I honestly videoed it but there have been several I've taken over the last few days that are just gone. I wanted to watch that.  Then last night I noticed a light on the night sky.  No sphere but the light seemed foreign.  I want to say maybe a spot light but after my experience the night before I don't know.  I've been having something torment me. I dunno what's going on all the sudden but all I know is a saw a black mass in our backyard. 2 days later I'm throwing up and mysteriously fall in the bathroom.  I lost some time there but I have a concussion.;38.2272333333333;-84.8698027777779
