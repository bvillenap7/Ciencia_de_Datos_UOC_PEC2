Almost like an explosion.  It was about 3:00am.  The sound was so loud that it vibranted my floors, walls and windows.  It sacred me at first.  The explosion lasted for a minute and then it was over.  I thought about how strange that was and just rolled over and went back to sleep.  Nobody else in the house heard it.;38.2272333333333;-84.8698027777779
