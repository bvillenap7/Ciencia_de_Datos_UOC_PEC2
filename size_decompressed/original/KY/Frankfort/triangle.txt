It was my first sighting, and it scared me to death.;2007-06-24 12:34:00;About 30 seconds;It was my first sighting, and it scared me to death. A witness and myself were sitting on my open roof patio star gazing when we spotted a light about 100 feet above the trees in the distance. We looked at this object for about 15 seconds, then it started to move, it gradually gained speed untill it sped off at a speed i could not make out. This was my first sighting, and it really freaked me out, but i will keep looking for it and try to take some picutures next time.

As we continued driving, we noticed that the object was not moving, it was just hovering. There was a red flashing light, along with Blue and green lights, as well.  Still driving trhead, the object was now on the right of us.  My fiancee then attempted to to video the object, however thre phone died.  My fiancee rolled the window down and stuck his grad out of the window to see it better.  It was then that he saw the shape of the object, which was a triangle, and he saw the red and Blue lights.  Again, the object was not moving, it was just hovering around in the sky approximately 500 yards in the air.;38.2272333333333;-84.8698027777779
