It appears in the image, but did not notice anything in the sky.;2014-03-07 10:00:00;I don't know;It appears in the image, but did not notice anything in the sky. I drove south on 65 when I took with about 60 mph the picture of the Dinosaur.  I drove a Chrysler Van and it was appx. 10 am, sunny, no clouds and appx 50 degrees. I wanted to take the picture of the dinosaur for my grandkids and I pointed my cell phone at the Dinosaur and took the picture without checking the image I took. Today, I noticed 2 objects in this picture that haven’t been there in the sky.  I did not see anything or I did not noticing. I am not sure I did not take a mirror image from the windshield or anything…  Maybe you can help. ((NUFORC Note:  We have looked at the photograph of the objects, and we cannot identify them.  They are reminiscent of the appearance of overhead fluorescent lights, but we cannot say that is what they are.  We may post them to our website.  PD));38.2272333333333;-84.8698027777779
