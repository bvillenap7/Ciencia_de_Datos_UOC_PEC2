Three orange lights flying from west to east over Frankfort, Kentucky on Forth of July, 2016;2016-07-04 21:30:00;30 minutes;Three orange lights flying from west to east over Frankfort, Kentucky on Forth of July, 2016 My husband and I were down by the small lake behind our house watching fireworks going off in surrounding neighborhoods.  At about 9:30 pm or so, I noticed a light to the left of us behind a tree in our yard.  I assumed it was some sort of firework.  I saw it go past, toward the front of our house, and paid it little mind. About 5-10 minutes later, my husband exclaimed that there was an orange light in the sky.  He had seen three orange lights in the night sky two to three months ago.  He said that was the same sort of light he had seen previously.  We watched the orange light fly above our house from east to west until it was out of sight.  It moved in a straight line at a pretty rapid clip.  The location in the sky was a little lower than where you would typically see a helicopter travel. A few minutes after that, we saw a third light, also moving from west to east but this one was a bit to the north and not directly over our house.  We watched it fly toward the east until we could see it no more. There was no sound with any of the lights.  No blinking, no trail.  I will note that the fireworks going on were loud, but I think if they were a normal aircraft, we would have heard them. I took a photo, but it isn't good at all, sadly.;38.2272333333333;-84.8698027777779
