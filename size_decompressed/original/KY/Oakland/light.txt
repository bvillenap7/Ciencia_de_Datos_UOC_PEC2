Saw a stationary light to the south.  Almost looked like it was trying to break into smaller lights. An airplane went into the same vicinity and when it got close the light just vanished and never came back.  What we thought was a star just disappeared and I know stars don't do that.  It never came back.  We have been seeing a.strange light everyday at dusk.;37.0006;-86.2534
