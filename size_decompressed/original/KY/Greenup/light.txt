As we were heading back to the boat dock there was a light streaked from the horizon toward us as were traveling westward in the boat.  I am not suggesting it was in our atmosphere, it was more like the satellites that we see on clear nights but with exceptional speed.   I drive about an hour each way to work daily and always see commercial jetliners in the sky and if they are traveling at 500 or so miles per hour these objects were traveling at 10,000 miles per hour.   We followed the first one from the horizon to nearly a 90 degree angle above us and stopped like it hit a wall then it streaked to the south as quickly as it came from the horizon to the angle above us.   As we were discussing the event between us another light came at us from the horizon, and it did exactly the same as the first one, it stopped like it hit a wall and immediately made a 90 degree turn to the south.  I've told this story over the years and only after watching TLC tonight about UFO's did I find out about your website and the UFO reporting opportunity.    I would like to know if you have had any similar sightings.
