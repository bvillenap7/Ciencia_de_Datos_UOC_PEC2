Constant glow of light...  A second one appears close to the main craft then disappears.  Looking to be in the 747 cruise altitude but hard to tell from ground level.  Did not behave like a passenger craft, a fighter craft, a balloon, a satellite, not a shooting start.   Oddly  behaved structural pattern with oddly  behaved light and flight pattern.  No altered color patterns to describe a plane or satellite.  Smooth start like light.  But starts do not move thru the night sky as so.   Looked like a chevron shaped start moving forward from one end of the wing is the front with the tail end being the other time of the wing.  As though the chevron was moving sideways.   If my phone were able for a picture, it would be included but would have been redundant concluding how most reports end. ((NUFORC Note:  Spent rocket?  PD)) ((NOTE FROM MR. TED MOLCZAN)) Hello Peter, Your hunch probably is correct. The Sentinel 2A satellite was launched on a Vega rocket from the Guiana Space Center, last night at 9:52 PM EDT (Jun 23 01:52 UTC). Coverage of the launch was here: http://spaceflightnow.com/2015/06/22/vv05-mission-status-center/ SeeSat-L received several reports of sightings near 23:49 EDT (3:49 UTC), of what appears to have been exhaust from the final burn of the Vega rocket's AVUM liquid fueled upper stage. That burn lowered the perigee to ensure that the object decays from orbit within a reasonable time, in order to curb the growth of space debris. http://satobs.org/seesat/Jun-2015/0193.html http://satobs.org/seesat/Jun-2015/0194.html http://satobs.org/seesat/Jun-2015/0195.html http://satobs.org/seesat/Jun-2015/0198.html http://satobs.org/seesat/Jun-2015/0199.html  Marco Langbroek blogged his analysis: http://sattrackcam.blogspot.nl/2015/06/aurora-hunter-images-last-moments-of.html Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.
