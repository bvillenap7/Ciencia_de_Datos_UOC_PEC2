I saw this fireball shaped object/s about three different times. The first time I saw it, my mother and I were on US23, waiting for the light to turn green, as we were waiting turning on to the AA Highway, I saw about five or six orange fireball shaps. These fireballs moved togeather, NOT seperated at a large distance. Then they stoped, then disapeared, and all came back and made a very low-cut ARCH type of formation. Not a strait line, but not the Mcdonalds ARCH either. Then they would all flash on and off at different time. They made very sharp turns and strange movment. I saw this very same thing 2 or 3 more times after with my friends. But it was about 5 air miles away for the first sighting.I give my word all is true!!! THANKS & GOD BLESS!!!
