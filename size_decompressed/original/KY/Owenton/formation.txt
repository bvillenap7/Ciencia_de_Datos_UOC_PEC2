Flying at low altitude but could not see object in great detail due to light formations. Object was in view for approx. 30-45 seconds, then simply disappeared from sight. Object was viewed by three adults and one 9 year old child on 11/16/99 approx. 5 miles south of Owenton,KY which is a small town approx. 70 miles south of Cincinnati, OH. Evidently, hundreds of people in the Cincinnati area saw the same object, and the incident was reported on the 11:00 news. Object was long with several bright lights which were in a peculiar formation.  Object was first seen through a window of my house.  Upon discovery of object, I hurried out the door and onto the deck which overlooks a lake.  Object seemed to float through the air at a relatively slow speed.  There was no audible sound from the object. Although, it was flying at a pretty low altitude, it was difficult to view object in great detail.  I think this was primarily due to the nature of the object itself.  Again, it was a rather long object and maybe can best be described as an abstract floating train.  Object was in view for approx. 30-50 seconds all the while traveling at a relatively slow, steady speed.  Then simply disappeared.;38.4935;-84.8103
