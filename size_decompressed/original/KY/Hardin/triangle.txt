We saw a triangle being followed by a helicopter!;1998-05-01 00:00:00;about 30 seconds;We saw a triangle being followed by a helicopter! It was the day before the Kentucky Derby.Me and two freinds were camping,and at about 12am we heard a helicopter,and noticed the lights from it about a quater of a mile away.You could tell by the sound that it was landing.So we didnt think much of it until about 30 minutes later we heard it taking off. So we ran to a clearing in the trees to see what kind of chopper it was,when over our heads flew this black triangle that was small(about the size of the helcopter we saw later)it had no lights and made no sound.The helicopter seemed o be following it,and it was a army copter(I think it's called a louch,or loche or somethig like that)Ive never seen anything like it before.And what I wonder is why the helicopter was landing in the woods,was it meeting the UFO?Makes you wander cause the nearest millitary basis about 20 or 30 miles from where we were! ((NUFORC Note:  We received another report and video from a gentleman, who witnessed and photographed something unusual in the vicinity of the Kentucky Derby later that morning.  The video seemed inconclusive to us, but the witness was quite sincere and animated about his sighting, we felt.));36.7799;-88.2603
