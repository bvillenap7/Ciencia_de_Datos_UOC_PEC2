Several bright lights stationary in the sky, turned and flew east away from hovering spot, then blinked out.;2014-04-09 21:30:00;45 seconds;Several bright lights startionary in the sky, turned and flew east away from hovering spot, then blinked out. Driving on 75 norths exit to 275 east, my wife and I notice 4 bright lights in the sky which appeared to be hovering, not moving in any direction, but facing due south.   I slowed the car to almost a stop to watch as the lights turned east and starting moving in that direction, then just blinked out after it started to move.  It was fairly low and I rolled down the window to listen for engine noise, helicopter sounds ect.  And heard nothing.  Only my own tires on the road.  It did seem as if the lights had exchanged places a few times through out the viewing.  We were thinking it was a military craft, either way thought it worthy of reporting.;38.9923999999998;-84.6462000000015
