The vehicle was landed in the creek and as I carefully approached it there were two figures around the vehicle.  As they noticed me they quickly returned to the vehicle and took off.  The vehicle was a teardrop-shaped, metallic colored craft. It rose to extreme speeds in less than a second.  Then it was gone.;38.9923999999998;-84.6462000000015
Tear drop, silent, hover, silver reflective surface.  ((anonymous report));2017-09-09 12:04:00;8 minutes;Tear drop, silent, hover, silver reflective surface. Laying in hammock watching clear sky and object appeared suddenly.  It was silver, silent, tear drooped in shape and hovered over us for about two minutes, before we finally decided to get out of the hammock to investigate.   We are 100% certain it was not a plane because a plane actually flew under it while we watched hover.  Ha!  That provided size perspective relative to the Boeing 737.  It seemed to be about a quarter of the size of the plane.  We could also hear the planes engines but this craft was silent.  Its movements we odd.  It seemed to be able to move side to side a little.  It even seemed to shoot up at one point.  Then it finally took off at a high rate of speed.  It was so strange.
