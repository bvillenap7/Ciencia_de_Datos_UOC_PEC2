2 objects flashing changing colors,red,blue,&yellow or white;2001-09-17 04:45:00;30 minutes;2 objects flashing changing colors,red,blue,&yellow or white This morning around 4:30am we saw 2 flashing lights or spheres in the sky,at first we thought they were airplanes but they stayed in the same position we were able to watch from 4:30am until 5:00am a half hour.The objects fashed red,then blue,then yellow or white.Sometimes in that order sometimes not in order or at least I was not aware.I'm not very good on distances but I can say from were we saw the objects if you were to measure with a ruler it was about 6 inches apart,which I guess could have been miles or more.The first object brought to our attention was brighter and in a lower position,the other object which we noticed about 5 minutes afte the first was higher in position but not as bright ,it'c color sequence was red,blue,and yellow or white as well. That's all the information I have.Thanks ((NUFORC Note:  We presume the correct date os 17SE01.  PD));38.9923999999998;-84.6462000000015
