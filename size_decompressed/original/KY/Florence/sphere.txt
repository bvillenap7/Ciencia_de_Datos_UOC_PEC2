very bright very fast object moving west to east;2011-06-13 21:17:00;2 minutes;very bright very fast object moving west to east Let the dog out back shortly after 9:00 pm, looked up and saw a very bright, very white light, like a welders spark, coming out of the western sky in a direct line do east moving extremely fast.  Covered the whole sky horizon to horizon in just a few minutes.  Altitude appeared to be lower than commercial aircraft passing through.  Watched the last moments with binoculars object seemed to look triangular shape as it moved away from me.  Saw no flashing lights at all that would indicate it was aircraft.  It made no sound like an aircraft would make at similar altitude.;38.9923999999998;-84.6462000000015
Bright sphere heading west to east;2012-11-13 06:00:00;60-70 seconds;Bright sphere heading west to east I live in Northern Kentucky and on November 13 at 6:00 a.m. ET while in my back yard I witnessed a bright white orb overhead at the eleven o’clock position to my south heading west to east. Altitude could not be determined but it appeared lower than most aircraft that do high flyovers but not as low as aircraft landing at the local airport.  I watched it through my 10x50 wide angle binoculars and could not see any flashing colored lights like commercial aircraft have.  The sighting lasted about 60-70 seconds and never deviated from it’s course. This is the third time I’ve seen this in the last three years from my back yard. Always the same description, position, heading and speed. (On one other occasion, that my 9 year old daughter pointed out to me from our back yard, the object looked like a blueish-green light circulating counter clockwise, like it was in a circular flourescent bulb, at the same position, speed and heading as the three bright white orb sightings).  Afterwards I immediately checked the real-time ISS position but it was over Europe so it was not that, also it does not follow a direct straight west to east direction.  It had the brightness and was as large as Jupiter or Venus would appear but only moving much faster.  BTW Washington DC is directly east of me and many military bases are directly west of me, not that this has any known correlation.;38.9923999999998;-84.6462000000015
