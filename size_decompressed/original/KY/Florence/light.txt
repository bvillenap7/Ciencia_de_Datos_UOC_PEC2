Two objects traveling side by side pass over, as one begins to zig, zag it's path.;2000-10-10 21:30:00;4-5 seconds;Two objects traveling side by side pass over, as one begins to zig, zag it's path. I was standing in a dark parking lot behind a bank in Florence, KY.  I was looking up, observing the stars when I observed two bright lights traveling quickly over my head.  I was facing north, and the lights came from behind me and continued north at a extremely high rate of speed.  The two lights were traveling side by side.  I believed them to be shooting stars at first, because they were lights and because of their speed.  However, they did not leave any tails behind them.  BUT, what peaked my interest even more than seeing two traveling side by side, was that the light on the right began to zig, zag back and forth like a snake's path, but stayed on the same path as the one on the left.  They continued north until the bright lights of the city either obscured them, or they burnt out.;38.9923999999998;-84.6462000000015

While walking one of my dogs, I noticed 3 round to oval shaped lights, all varying from an orangish yellow to orange red in color, in the Northeastern sky moving Southwestward toward Mt.Zion Rd. area near Florence Key.  A larger one appeared to be in front or closer as they moved.  They stopped an hovered a minute or so. During that time the two smaller lights in the back moved toward each other seeming to touch.  They then separated an one, then the other following, took off northeast in the direction they came and disappeared from sight.  The larger one hovered a few more seconds then also took off  in the same direction of the other two. No sound was noticed.  It was at this time I attempted to take a picture with my cell phone and just caught a blurred glimpse of the orange light.  On the camera screen it appeared more as a streak or angled line of light.;38.9923999999998;-84.6462000000015

It was there for about 10 minutes and then we looked away for about 2 minutes and when we looked back it was completely gone.  Just a couple of minutes ago we looked and it was back and then gone again. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
