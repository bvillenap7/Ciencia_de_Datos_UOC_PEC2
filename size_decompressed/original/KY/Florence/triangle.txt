Not moving... no sound. ((e-address deleted)) ((Query by NUFORC, and follow-up response)) Dear((name deleted)), Thank you for the report!  I am curious to know if you are certain of the date indicated in your report.  I ask for a particular purpose.  If I do not hear from you, I will assume that the date is correct. Thank you again for sharing the information with our Center. Cordially, -- Peter B. Davenport, Director National UFO Reporting Center PO Box 45623 University Station Seattle, WA 98145 director@ufocenter.com http://www.UFOcenter.com Hotline: 206-722-3000 (From 8AM to Midnight Pacific preferred) ((Response)) Mr. Davenport,     I am 100 percent sure of the date on the sighting in Florance Ky. As soon as we ( my 14yr. son) arrived in Lexington KY. I wrote the date and location and time down we saw the triangle shape in the sky.(8:20pm)  My son,  who normally tells me it is just another plane.. actually rolled down his window and said.  Mom, I think you are right.. that is no plane or helicoptor, I don't know what it is.  There were at least two other air crafts in the sky and we were watching those as they were fairly low as I assumed there was a air port close by.  Since I was driving it was hard for me to watch the planes.  Then my  son noticed somthing unusual..  very bright white lights on each corner of the of a third air craft. We were not that close to actually verify it was trianglar in shape.  But, from me just looking out the window.  I would say yes... it had a triangle shape.  It was moving when we first saw it and then it just more or less just hung there.. no sound.  I can't say for sure if it was a UFO.  But, it gave us good converstation on the way to my parents house in Lexington. Sincerely, ((name deleted));38.9923999999998;-84.6462000000015
I left my boyfriends house in Hebron KY around 1:15am.  I was headed south to my home in Crittenden KY.  I noticed a large, bright oran;2008-07-27 01:30:00;5min.;I left my boyfriends house in Hebron KY around 1:15am.  I was headed south to my home in Crittenden KY.  I noticed a large, bright orange light (about a half mile in front of me) in the sky along south-bound I-75 around the Dream Street area.  As I got closer I noticed that the light was on the front of what appeared to be a triangular shaped object.  It did not appear to be moving.  My best GUESStimate was that it was about 50-75 feet in the air.  As I drove underneath the object I saw two green lights and one red light, all of which were blinking as opposed to the one in front (the orange one) which was not blinking.  I could not tell if the three blinking lights were on the bottom or the side of the object due to the fact that I was passing under it at around 60mph.

Blue aura, september 13th 2011. vanished in sky. possibly triangular. 6-11 p.m.;2011-09-13 21:00:00;possibly 3 1/2 seconds;blue aura, september 13th 2011. vanished in sky. possibly triangular. 6-11 p.m. Is it a meteor is it a star?? Sept. 13th, 2011  Had casual conversation approx 2 other people one in front the other to my right. I looked up (to my left) an seen a blue object/aura/energy and I could only say it was moving relatively quickly/fast/covering ground.  No sound.  I do not know speeds  I do not know airplane speeds  I do not know shooting star speeds.  It had approx. 2 ½ seconds of movement and simply “went invisible/disappeared” where did it go.  It was heading in the direction to my left and kept a left path then just nothing. Invisible.  Like it was never there. 2 ½ seconds and it cut out.  If I was to say a shape I could say triangular that’s it. It was more of the light-mid color blue I seen radiating off of it.  The color I can describe accurately than anything else. If you look at the moon and relax your eyes you see a blue glow off of it.  It was a full moon that night, and that color (when you relax your eyes to the moon and see the blue coming off it) was the color of the aura/energy/object I seen. I want to say it VANISHED. AS FAR AS SIZE, that’s all relative I do not know. I couldn’t tell you the slightest bit.  It was there and if the person to my right had looked up at the same time he would of caught 2 seconds of it. That person would have seen it.  It was there. I just do not know what it is.  P.s. I do not want the FBI HERE. I MERELY WANT AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT I SEEN. BY COMPARED REPORTS FROM YOUR WEBSITE. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME TYPE OF POSTING ON SEPTEMBER 13th 2011 when I type in google. That’s all I want. If you could put it on a form or something that would be great, but when I type in google September 13 2011 sightings I WANT something to come up: because something was there, and it needs to be explained.

Triangle shaped object, 3 white lights, 1 red light in the center, extremely loud and prolonged sound.;2011-09-21 03:00:00;a few hours;Triangle shaped object, 3 white lights, 1 red light in the center, extremely loud and prolonged sound. There was a really loud noise, like a jet but even louder and longer than a jet flying by.  I looked out the window and saw a triangle shaped object with 3 white lights at each of the tips of the triangle, and a blinking red light in the center.  This happened several time from 3 am to about 6 am.;38.9923999999998;-84.6462000000015
