Circular, rustic looking craft  over Florence, Kentucky.;2013-07-27 23:30:00;1 minute;Circular, rustic looking craft  over Florence, Kentucky. While sitting in the driveway and watching the sky around midnight, my daughter looked Northwest and asked me in a startled tone of voice What is that!!!!.   Pointing upward was shadow like movement as if a falling star or meteor was approaching, however, there was no trail, no lights, no brightness, no sound. It was moving below the clouds and was a rustic color craft.   If one was not looking, it would have been missed.    It was traveling at a speed that was faster than an aircraft, but slower than a meteor.    It was round and no lights, nor any type of metallic to it, but it was definitely a craft of some sort. It progressed over our house and was on a direct course to the southeast.   As it was beyond our vision, it entered into some light pollution from the shopping mall nearby and it changed into a triangle like form and then disappeared.    It was very strange and only lasted a minute if that.  I have never seen anything like it before, very strange as if it was trying to maneuver quickly without drawing attention.;38.9923999999998;-84.6462000000015
Almost full-moon appearing object in distance above trees.  Not the full moon.;2015-11-14 19:00:00;2 minutes;Almost full-moon appearing object in distance above trees.  Not the full moon. I stepped out on the front porch which faces south, and to my left (east) I saw what looked like an almost-full moon hovering above the tree line a distance away.  It suddenly just disappeared.   I thought it was the moon and was covered by clouds, but it was a crystal clear starry night.   Suddenly, it appeared again, and remained for about 30 seconds, and abruptly disappeared again.  I discovered it wasn't a full-moon phase, but the moon is in a crescent phase at that time, so it was not the moon.;38.9923999999998;-84.6462000000015

It was not dark yet and very much daylight.  As I continued driving, I saw a bright blue orb of light appear about low cloud level.   It looked as if the blue orb of light came from no where, it was stationary then took off at an unbelievable rate and disappeared.;38.9923999999998;-84.6462000000015
