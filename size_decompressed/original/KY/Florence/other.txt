The larger one moved slowly across the sky with the two smaller ones following behind it.  I rubbed my eyes to make sure I was not just seeing things and they were still there.;38.9923999999998;-84.6462000000015
A star that blinked out.;2013-09-28 22:00:00;1 minute;A star that &quotblinked out&quot. Around 10:00 p.m. Saturday night after company left, I was cleaning up on the deck. I looked up and there was a star that was a bit brighter than the others and thought I don't remember seeing it there before.   It was there for a good minute or so and did not have the twinkle as a normal star would and was not a planet. I just watched it and it then went out as if a person would turn off a light.   I waited for more, but nothing.  There was no trail as if a meteor.   This has happened before with my daughter.  This time I saw it....it was as if it knew I was watching it.;38.9923999999998;-84.6462000000015
