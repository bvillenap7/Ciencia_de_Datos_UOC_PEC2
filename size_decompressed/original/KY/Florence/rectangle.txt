color changing ufo;2006-08-10 08:00:00;3-6 minutes;color changing ufo I was below decks on my sailboat preparing morning coffee and I saw a very bright flash of white light on my bulkheads. I presumed it was a landing light since I could also hear the sound of a small airplane which would have been SE of me and inbound to the local airport. The reflected light was extremely bright.  When I went on deck I looked up to where the sound came from to look at the plane and I saw a craft which was not at all an airplane.  It stopped making any sound and stopped in mid-air.  I felt it was looking at me!   It appeared to hover over a building located approx 200 mtrs away altho I'm sure it was past the physical ridge of the island.  It had a window area which looked like a cartoon version of human teeth 1 row upper 1 row lower.  It emited a color of red then changed colors to yellow to green to yellow then red. It blanked out all color and moved east (50 mtrs as I saw it) and stopped again and repeated the color sequence.  It moved once more, stopped, and repeated the color change.   It then moved off slow but steady toward Puerto Rico then gathered speed as it left.  It disappeared from my view into clouds.  It made no sound once I had it in my sight.  The next day I, along with many others, saw 3 water spouts in the exact places of the light changes from the day before.  We thought these water spouts might enter our anchorage and were making preparations to move into the safer pond area. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Possibly two UFOs over Florence, KY.  ((anonymous report));2016-06-09 18:00:00;2 minutes;Possibly two UFOs over Florence KY While swimming with my family, I noticed what looked like a rectangular cube hovering high in the sky, it was spinning, and one side of it was darker than the others or had a mirror finish.  It would go into the few clouds that were around it, completely disappear, then reappear a few seconds later.  The object did that a few times before going back into a cloud and completely vanishing for good.   My wife saw, and even managed to get a picture of either this object or what was possibly a second object, but she described this one as being more of a round shape, with the same color scheme to it, the picture however, was taken on a cell phone and was too far away to be able to make out any details. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  We would like to look at the photo, but have no means of contacting the source of the report.
