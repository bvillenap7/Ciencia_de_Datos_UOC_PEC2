Silver ball with bat wings.;2013-06-22 16:00:00;1 minute;Silver ball with bat wings My parents would never file a ufo report, so I am doing this on their behalf since sightings are so limited and unusual in our region. We live in the mountains of southeast KY in Harlan County.  On June 22 at approximately 3 or 4 in the afternoon, my parents were sitting on the front porch when my father asked, “What is that thing?” My mother looked to where my father was staring to see a silver round ball with wings, ascending down the side of the mountain.  According to my father, the ball had come from a southwesterly direction over a place where the mountain “dips,” for lack of a better word, and descended at an angle into the valley.  It stopped just as it reached the top of a utility pole that runs adjacent to the railroad lines that come from the coal mines and extend through our hollow.   When I inquired how the wings were shaped, I assumed they were like the fins on a rocket.  However, when I drew it for my mother, she corrected me, telling me the wings were more “bat-shaped” and coming from the sides at an angle, as though they were very slightly “pinned back” on the silver ball.   There is a lane with houses on the other side of the tracks, and my mother stated that the ball was about the same size as the cars parked at the houses on the other side of the tracks.  Once the ball reached the utility pole, it continued to travel in a northerly direction, following the utility line, out of the hollow.;36.7586;-83.3532
