A white/red light aircraft moving at a very fast speed.;2019-07-04 21:30:00;1 hour;A white/red light aircraft moving at a very fast speed. It started out as a circle with a red somewhere around it. It looked like a star in the sky but then I looked around and no other stars was in the sky so I watched it for about 30 minutes. It then shot straight up at a fast pace in the sky and hovered there for about 30 minutes. Then it took off going north at a very fast paced speed. Faster than anything Iâ€™ve ever seen.
