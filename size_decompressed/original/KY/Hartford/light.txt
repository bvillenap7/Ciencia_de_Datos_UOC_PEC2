Was driving down 62 from rosine to beaver dam and that's when I see all 3 of them at once.   One by the moon.  It was the lowest.  It looked like the shape of a ship.  Then the other two were spaced evenly apart across the sky.  They just looked like really really bright stars.  They appear every night in the sky over Ohio county (Hartford) Kentucky.  Not sure what they are but definitely sure they aren't stars.  Has anyone else seen these bright lights?  Tonight they disappeared early tonight around midnight but I can usually still see them when coming inside to go to bed at 1:00am.  They are in the sky every night.  They changed color from white to yellow to red.;37.48;-86.9181
