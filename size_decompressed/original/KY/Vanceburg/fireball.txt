flashing light making sharp irregular turns;2001-10-19 19:50:00;5 minutes;flashing light making sharp irregular turns At about (Lewis County NE Kentucky)7:50 PM I was outside watching the stars and smoking when I seen an object flashing a specific sequence of lights.  I thought nothing of it...I thought it was an air plane when it suudenly make a sharp turn...anout 20 degrees.  It continued to make  turns until it was on it's original path (approx.)  Taking onto account it's obvvious ability to backtrack the original course I can only assume it was communicating.;38.4667;-83.2653
