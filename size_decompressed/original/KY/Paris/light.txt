Intense silvery white light/orb appearing in front of a large cloud in Paris Ky.;2008-04-20 19:00:00;seconds;Intense silvery white light/orb appearing in front of a large cloud in Paris Ky. It was approximately 7:00pm and I was driving east on the Paris bypass (US-62) headed to work. It was getting dark, and there were large cumulus clouds in the sky. On this particular road, there isn't much but countryside, farms etc, everything is pretty open. I was trying to keep my eyes on the road, but I was also paying alot of attention to these amazing huge white clouds in the darkened sky. Amazing scenery. At one instance, I looked back up at this big cloud out to the right side of my windshield, and an intense ball of silver white light just appeared. It burst out in front of this cloud. Out of nowhere. It was not a star, and it wasn't a plane. It was a round intense ball of silvery white light that stayed in the same place for a few seconds, then it slowly took off to the left a short distance and faded out. Like it went into the cloud. A white car was in front of me, and they had to have seen it too. The distance of the object is hard to determine. From my perspective It was about he size of a dime right beside this huge mid level cloud. Very bright.;38.2083540816326;-84.2450724489795
very bright flashing light streaking over Paris KY, disappeared before reaching horizon;2010-05-31 00:00:00;3-4 seconds;very bright flashing light streaking over Paris KY, disappeared before reaching horizon At approximately midnight (maybe 15 minutes past?), my neighbor and I went outside to grab some sodas out of her car, and I happened to look up, just admiring the sky. I noticed a small light coming from the west, nearly straight overhead, moving fast. I pointed it out to my neighbor, who also saw it. It traveled east and blinked out before it reached the tree line. The light was bright white, and blinking, but there’s no way an airplane was moving that fast-it literally took only a couple of seconds to cross the sky. There was no engine noise, no sonic boom, just the light. Weather was partly cloudy, and there was a storm to our south, with lightening that we could see on the horizon. There were fireflies out-however, this was definitely not a firefly, because the color of the light was too white to be a lightening bug (our local fireflies are usually green), and the blinking was too fast. I’m not exactly sure what we saw, so I’m hoping someone else saw it too!;38.2083540816326;-84.2450724489795
