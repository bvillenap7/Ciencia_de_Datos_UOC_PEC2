Thought it was a satillite that grew in brightness magnitude from a 5 to say 100 and back to a 5.   (Is this what a flare from a satillite looks like?  It was like a slow flash). The object carried on alomg its trajectory like other satillites ive seen in orbit, but ive never seen the flash from one before.;38.2083540816326;-84.2450724489795
