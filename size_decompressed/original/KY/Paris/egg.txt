While camping on the back of my Aunt's farm, We saw two lights in the distant sky. We thought nothing of them until, the two lights suddenly got brighter and came fling towards us. They seemed to be headed right towards us and when they got about 200 yards from us they started blinking with white and red lights for it seemed a minute or so, then took off and within seconds they were gone.  I told my elderly mother about this and she claims to have seen a ufo in the earlier 1970's  around the same spot. She had almost exact recalection of the events I describe here.;38.2083540816326;-84.2450724489795
