white craft with red stripe streaking extremely fast in sky, with engine break grinding/whinning sound following within 2seconds;2008-09-20 02:00:00;2 mins;white craft with red stripe streaking extremely fast in sky, with engine break grinding/whinning sound following within 2seconds I was sitting outside at work at approx. 2am. i just happened to look to the left as i was star gazing on break. in the exact direction i looked i immediately saw a flash of light move from the west to east. if i had held a pencil up at arms length it would have just barely blocked out sighting of craft.  it seemed to suddenly appear and streak to the east and dissapeared. moving extremely fast, like a flash and streak of a shooting star but it appeared to be white with a red stripe on the side about middle ways down on object. no sound. and it was gone. i looked away and about 2seconds later heard a sound iminating from sighting direction that sounded like a jet engine craft had accidently been shifted from high speed gear down to bulldog/low gear. and it reverberated like engine was totally stressed to the point of destruction. the sound pulsed lower and lower and lower as if some kind of engine break had been thrust on. it went from west to east and was at an alltitude of approx. 10,000ft. appeared to be about 10 to 15 miles south of Lebanon, ky. Marion county. This was not a conventional aircraft or meteorite. it was a really machanical engine sound. and was moving very fast possibly in excess of 2000 miles an hr. or more easily. ((NUFORC Note:  Source indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));37.5623;-85.2645000000001
