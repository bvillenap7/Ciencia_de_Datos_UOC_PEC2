I am not one that puts too much thought into extra terresrial life, I do believe they exist but can't convince myself they are anymore advanced than ourselves though how hard would that be? lol.   However, this morning May 14th 2013 at 3:15am myself and a coworker were coming home from work to Campbellsville on U.S. 68 west and shortly after passing the poor boys resaraunt I spotted something in the sky I believed to be a stadium light.   Asked my co-worker if there was anything back that way cause i'm relatively new to the area he said there's a tower with a red blinking airplane light somewhere but this did not have a red light and was not blinking.   As we approached closer we came to realize it was something flying but not moving or making sound.  Ok, kinda strange.   Then we got to where we were directly beneath it.  It was no more than 200 feet in the air, light were facing forward only and hovering there making no sound.   I was astounded and frightened, I cannot describe the mass of it only the large forward facing lights like stadium lights and it looked like there was something strobing within the structure but was obscured by something like it was internal but you could kind of see thru the outter skin of this craft into the inside of it.   I don't know,Ii've not been able to stop talking about it and everyone thinks I've gone mad besides the other guy who rides to work with me.   I know I won't be so skeptical about these things from now on and would like to learn more incase anyone knows of a new type of military aircraft capable of hovering and making no sound with an opaque skin or force field;37.5623;-85.2645000000001
