Videotaped unidentified object floating in front of the moon during the lunar eclipse.;2007-08-28 05:45:00;1 minute;Videotaped unidentified object floating in front of the moon during the lunar eclipse. I was up Tuesday morning filming the lunar eclipse when an object floated in from the right to the left on the lit part of the moon.  The object was as wide as the moon, it stopped in the middle and started moving to the top.  It stayed in front of the moon for at least a minute before it started to disappear up into the darkness.  It was large and oddly shaped.  The outer part of the unidentified object reached to both sides of the moon.  Have it all on video.;38.3374;-83.5625
