Silent orange orb sighting.;2020-06-06 23:15:00;60 seconds;Silent orange orb sighting 6/6/2020 11:15pm EDT Buckner, KY 40010  I am an amateur astronomer and computer engineer as a career.  I’m accustomed to understanding the world around me and what I see. Saturday night, my wife and I both saw something I can not explain. It was an orange orb moving across the sky. I’m guessing it was between 5-10,000 feet in altitude and roughly the size of a 747 at that height moving at about the same speed as a commercial airliner at that altitude. The most common explanation online is a Chinese lantern, it was not one. I held an ATF license for commercial fireworks for 3 years and have set off many Chinese lanterns.  It moved in a straight line with no changes in speed or direction. We watched it for a solid 60 seconds from directly overhead to disappearing over the horizon moving north to south. Comparing it to a full moon, it appeared to be ¼ to ½ of the size. It was very large compared to anything else I’ve ever seen. It also made no noise. No sound of an engine, no hum, nothing. I am attaching a very poor video where I captured the last 15 seconds of the object as it disappeared over the horizon.;38.3736;-85.4513
