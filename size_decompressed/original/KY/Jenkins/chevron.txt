Bright green object in chevron shape;1999-03-29 02:00:00;4 seconds;Bright green object in chevron shape Traveling on US 23 North.  Driving van, saw a flash through front window. Looked out driver's side window to see object fly up over mountain tops. Road I was driving on has mountains on each side. The object was flying close to the vehicle that I was driving. It reminded me of a Stealth but I can't imagine a Stealth being green illuminated.  It caught my attention because it was so bright and close. I don't know what it was but I know what I saw.;37.2080461538461;-82.6715692307692
