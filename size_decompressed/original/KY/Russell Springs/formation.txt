The dog was barking loud on the front porch at some wild coyotes howling off in the background, so I steaped outside to listen to them crying in the backwoods. I lit up a cig and looked up and noticed off towards the north-western sky there was three something zippin across the sky in a tight pattern, then as I cleared my eyes by blinking afew times I noticed it stoped and seemed to pulse with lights acouple blinks and zip gone. and thats it, it reminded me of a tringle formation but seem to rotate.
