We was shooting off fireworks for our 4th of July at home in the front yard, and just noticed two very bright stars in a line,  and with-in minuets they dimmed to about the same brightness to the stars around them and started to move to the north (from the southern part of the sky)   then just vanishing in almost in a wave effect like light bending till objects totally faded into the black sky.;37.0551;-85.0375
Strange lights seen in Russell County.;2015-12-14 19:00:00;5 minutes;Strange lights seen in Russell county A friend and myself were taking a walk together with my dog and we were talking about how we didn't get to see the Geminid meteor shower and while talking about it we looked up and noticed objects looking like stars but brighter and they numbered to be prolly 40 or 50 of them.  What was even stranger was that some of them traveled in shape if a triangle.  They were all traveling from east to west and was moving without producing any noise at all.   Also noticed that they were trying to stay in the clouds like they were trying to stay hid. Thats what really freaked me out.   I know this sounds insane but this makes 5 times ive seen something i cldnt explain in my lifetime and every time it happened i had a witness with me.  Once was in broad daylight and it was a ufo and i told everybody nd noone believed me until it came out in the neespaper.  What i saw tonight was different.;37.0551;-85.0375
