Strange 5 to 6 second pulse of Light streaked across Kentuckys view towards the north-east.;2011-09-22 13:15:00;10 Minuets;Strange 5 to 6 second pulse of Light streaked across Kentucky's view towards the north-east. I was taking the trash out and happen to look up and seen a flash like a aircraft so I didn't pay too much mind to it, I wheeled out my trash and set it beside the road and thought to look up again and noticed the flash again but almost in the same spot, the flashes was just it alone and ever 5 or 6 seconds, far more delay then aircraft, so I thought I would report it. It's prob UARS satellite but who knows I sure don't!   I watched it for a good 8 - 10 minutes as it moved out of site far to the north-east moving north to north-east.;37.0551;-85.0375
