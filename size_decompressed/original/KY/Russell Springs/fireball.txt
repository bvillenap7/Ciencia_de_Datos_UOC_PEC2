Ascending orange fireball- like circle with a glow trailing it.;2012-11-18 19:15:00;10 minutes;Ascending Orange fireball- like circle with a glow trailing it I observed an orange colored, fireball-like, light which appeared to have a glow trailing it, like something on fire in the sky.  It appeared to be circular & moving at a somewhat moderate speed.  There wasn't any sound.  I was in my vehicle in a parking lot as it appeared to have just floated up from behind some apt. buildings.  I was picking up my child from his father apt. as he also witnessed it. We watched as it continued moving upward then just faded into the sky.  I photographed it with my phone before it completely disappeared.  It was dark outside & essentially a clear sky.;37.0551;-85.0375
Orange fireball passes directly overhead in southern KY.;2012-11-18 19:20:00;2 minutes;Orange fireball passes directly overhead in southern KY At approximately 7:15pm on 11/18/12 we observed in the sky a ball of fire moving from the north to the south.  I came almost directly overhead maybe 800 to 1000 feet off the ground.   I first thought it was an airplane on fire as it was moving toward local airport.  As it came overhead you could see that there was no structure on fire but just this huge ball of fire moving silently through the sky.   As it went on to the south it appeared to veer to the right moving westward and continued until it went out of sight over the horizon.   This thing cast an immense glow and you could see the flames jumping and flickering.  You would expect to hear something as you would with any other craft passing overhead but it was silent.   My ex-wife who is an RN witnessed this also.  She spotted it first.  I am a college graduate and am mostly skeptical of any UFO reports.   This was truly unexplainable.;37.0551;-85.0375
