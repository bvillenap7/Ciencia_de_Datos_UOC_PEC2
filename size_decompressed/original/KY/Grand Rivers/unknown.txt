Silent, lighted object passing leisurely overhead.;1981-06-30 21:00:00;10 seconds;Silent, lighted object passing leisurely overhead. This is my second experience with something that now makes me feel we must be experienceing visitations of some sort. I co-own a restaurant, which can be a stressful place at times, and left work one night upset and distracted about something that happened at work.   I was walking the 1/2 block home and my mind was preoccupied with whatever it was that had just happened at work.  This I can remember for some reason.  I recall seeing something about the size of a commercial plane (I don't remember it being overly large or small) that was not so very far off the ground, maybe a half mile.  This was after dark so I don't remember seeing a shape per se.  I do remember that it was silent and had lights rather like windows.  I remember thinking that it was strange that it made no sound.  I remember it passing over at a leisurely speed, slower than I'd expect an airliner to be going.  I did not believe in UFO's at the time so I didn't really pay it much attention as my mind was focused on whatever problem had occurred at work.   I'd love to have the opportunity to see it again now that I'm more full! y aware of worldwide sightings. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
