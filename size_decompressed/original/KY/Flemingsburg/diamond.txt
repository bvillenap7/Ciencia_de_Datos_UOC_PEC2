Diamond-shaped craft/configuration of lights transforms into rectangular low-flying lights;2006-12-27 18:00:00;4-5 minutes;Diamond-shaped craft/configuration of lights transforms into rectangular low-flying lights The sky was pitch black and when leaving McDonald's I looked southwest toward Crain Creek Road and saw a round white light with two rectangular/elliptical flashing white lights below the first light and side by side, another round white light equidistance below the two lights as the first one was above.  I saw the diamond shape but do not know whether these were separate craft or what.  I saw the whole diamond configuration for only a few seconds the top light disappeared and then the bottom light did as well about 15 seconds after the top one.  It appeared to drift southwest but never went above the horizon.  Instead it appeared to lower and fly through trees.  I rolled my window down but heard no unusual noise.  (No helicopter or airplane noise).  It was as plain as day to me but no one else seemed to notice except my son who saw the lower light and the two middle ones.;38.4303;-83.7056000000001
