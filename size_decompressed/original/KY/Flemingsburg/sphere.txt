I pick a picture up on my wild life camera pointing down toward the ground from a maple tree beside my garden. We picked up a picture of a orb shaped ball of light. we thought maybe it was a rain drop. but the camera was pointing down, and there was more light in this picture than the others. It would be nice to know what you think about this picture. ((NUFORC Note:  Object close to camera, illuminated by flash.  Not a UFO.  Date is approximate.
