WE WERE CHASED BY A UFO .;1974-08-01 22:45:00;20 MIN;WE WERE CHASED BY A UFO . MY FRIEND AND I WERE TAKING A SHORT BIKE RIDE JUST OUTSIDE MY SUBDIVISION (AVON ESTATES) ONTO COMBS FERRY ROAD.  LESS THAN A QUARTER MILE OUT WE BOTH SAW A SAUCER SHAPED GLOWING WHITE OBJECT HOVERING OVER A FIELD.  IT LOOKED HUGE IN SIZE.  WE STOPPED BRIEFLY, BUT MY FRIEND TOOK OFF WITHOUT WARNING BACK TOWARD THE SUBDIVISION.  I IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED, AND ONCE I TURNED BACK INTO THE SUBDIVISION, I LOOKED BACK TO SEE THE OBJECT, AND IT WAS NO LONGER THERE.  I WAS TRYING HARD TO CATCH UP TO MY FRIEND, BUT WAS LOOKING AROUND FOR IT, AND SAW THAT IT HAD MOVED, IT WAS NOW WAY OVER THE WINCHESTER SIDE OF THE ROAD TO MY RIGHT, BUT WAS SEEMINGLY HOVERING AGAIN.  AT THAT POINT I WAS YELLING AT MY FRIEND TO LOOK WHERE IT WAS BUT SHE WAS PEDALING AS FAST AS SHE COULD UP THE HILL.  WHEN I REACHED THE TOP OF THE HILL TO TURN THE CORNER ONTO LA SOMME DRIVE, I WAS CLOSER TO MY FRIEND AND WE BOTH SAW THAT IT HAD MOVED AGAIN AND WAS NOW CLOSER AND ON OUR LEFT LESS THAN 1/4 MILE FROM US.WE HAD NOT SEEN IT ACTUALLY MOVE YET, BUT EACH MOVE WAS APRROXIMATELY 1 MILE APART IN DISTANCE, AND EACH TIME IT STOPPED AND HOVERED.  AT THIS POINT MY FRIEND AND I WERE SCREAMING TO EACHOTHER THAT IT WAS CHASING US!  WE TURNED INTO MY DRIVEWAY, GOT TO MY GARAGE, JUMPED OFF THE BIKES IN TIME TO SEE IT FLY DIRECTLY OVER US AND IN A BRIEF FEW SECONDS IT WAS OUT OF SIGHT.  IT WAS HUGE, AS BIG AROUND AS A MODEST SIZED HOME.  IT GLOWED WHITE WITH AMBER COLORED LIGHTS THAT CIRCLED AROUND THE MIDDLE OF IT.  IT MADE ABSOLUTELY NO SOUND AS IT MOVED QUICKLY OUT OF SIGHT.  MY FRIEND AND I WERE 15 YRS. OLD BUT KNEW NO-0NE WOULD BELIEVE US, AND NEVER REPORTED IT.  AT THIS TIME, I FEEL IT IS IMPORTANT TO DOCUMENT THIS INCIDENT, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANYONE BELIEVES IT OR NOT.  I KNOW THERE IS ONE OTHER PERSON ON THIS EARTH WHO SAW IT WITH ME.;38.0115012394512;-84.4536810917737
Disk-shaped object hovering up in the sky and traveling slowly for about 20 minutes with a brief flash of light coming out of it.;2005-04-25 20:00:00;20 minutes;Disk-shaped object hovering up in the sky and traveling slowly for about 20 minutes with a brief flash of light coming out of it. I was traveling down I-75 last night coming back to Lexington, Kentucky from Richmond, Kentucky where I attend graduate school classes.   It was directly in my line of sight right before the curve towards the Clays Ferry Exit. The sky had a few clouds but it was mostly clear. I saw it straight ahead and I saw a flash of light come from the other side and traveled halfway around the object and stopped.  It did not flash all the way around the object.  It only flashed once.  It was a disk- shaped object that was a dark color like a dark grey or brown, not quite black.   The interstate wound around and the object was no longer in front of me but it was traveling along to my right.  I was straining my eyes to see legs to a water tower, or helicoptor propellers, or wings to an airplane, but there was none of that.  It was not a water tower because for one thing, I found out that it was moving and there was nothing sticking out of the object like wings or propellers.  It was definitely going too slow to be an airplane.   The only other thing I could think of would be a blimp of some kind but it didn't have any kind of writing or basket and I don't know if those have lights.  Also, it was 8:00pm on a Monday night and no events going on that would require a blimp that I know of and it simply did not look like a blimp.  However, I am trying to justify this because it goes against everything I believe in or ever thought possible.   This thing was traveling in my line of sight for about 20 minutes.  When i got off on the Man-o-War  exit I turned the wrong way so that i could follow it and take a clear picture with my camera phone.  By the time I could stop it was too far away to see it in the picture.  My camera phone is not very clear at all, anyway.  It just kept traveling away from me and I gave up and turned back around and went home.   I am just a Nutrition grad school student and I do not have any expertise in the aircraft area.  All I know is what I saw.  Can someone please tell me what this thing might have been?  I need some peace of mind.;38.0115012394512;-84.4536810917737
I was walking down the street with my dog, and I noticed my small dog that never barks started to growl and spasm uncontrollabley. Then;2007-09-21 04:30:00;Several Hours;I was walking down the street with my dog, and I noticed my small dog that never barks started to growl and spasm uncontrollabley. Then a white light and a warm feeling came over me, and I was knocked to the ground and when I woke up I had several sore spots on my body and my anus hurt. The most puzzling thing would be that it was no longer early morning hours but more early afternoon. My location had changed and my clothes where tattered. I at first figured this could of been an accident by a veichle or possible mugging but much to my dismay my arms and legs had several various unrecogonizable burnt marks. This is very difficult for me to discuss.;38.0115012394512;-84.4536810917737
Craft with multiple lights, 1 red blinking light, in a saucer type shape in flight and hovering near a main road.;2008-11-08 19:55:00;Several seconds;A craft with multiple lights, 1 red blinking light, in a saucer type shape in flight and hovering near a main road. I was driving home from my dads house on New Circle when I saw a really bright light up in the sky, at first I thought it was a star. Then I saw it was in fact an object of some type, though I couldn't really make it out. I passed this figuring it was just some helicopter hovering perfectly above the road. Then, maybe 5 minutes later, I was still on New Circle between exit 5A and 5B (I was getting off at 5B, onto Versailles Rd.) when I saw a low flying object slowly come down at an angle towards the ground as if to land (though the airport is not over there and I don't know of any airstrip in that direction). I at first thought it was a plane but then the object stopped in mid-air, hovering. It had at least 3 bright white lights on it, and 1 red blinking light (thus I thought it to be a commercial plane at first). The shape of it seemed to be pretty thin, shaped kind of like a saucer. It looked to me like it had a flat top and the edges came out at slight diaganols pointing towards the ground. I was not able to get a very good look for long because I was driving and was literally just about at my exit, though I did brake to slow down and get a longer look. I have no clue if it made noise or not, I happened to be listening to my radio very loudly at the sighting. I believe that some others on the road saw it and thought it was something strange as well, as I noticed cars braking abnormally near the object.;38.0115012394512;-84.4536810917737
