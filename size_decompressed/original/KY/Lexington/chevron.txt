Lights over Lexington KY in a V shape formation.  Heading North.;2005-12-01 05:30:00;10 Min.;Lights over Lexington KY in a V shape formation.  Heading North. 5:30 AM I was coming home from work (I work at the Post Office late shift.)  Driving from West to East on New Circle road when I noticed a series of lights over the Fayette Mall area on Nicholasville road.  The thing that caught my eye was that the lights were stationary and not moving much.  At this point it looked like a single line of white lights.  I would estimate the pattern to be the size of a Concord jet (I have see one of those before flying kind of low in Europe at a special air show, so I know how big they look.)  I was driving toward the object when it did something that really caught my attention.  It made a right angle turn in the sky.  It did not make a slow turn like a plane but a rotating right angle turn. When it turned like that I could see that it was V shaped.  I have seen the TV show where all of these people saw a V shaped object and it looked just like that.  After that, it headed North at a very high rate of speed. It was gone extremely fast.  There were light clouds but I could see the object clearly. I was about a mile away.  I almost stopped my car and got out to watch it.  It was so unusual.;38.0115012394512;-84.4536810917737
Black chevron-shaped object with no lights observed over Lexington, Ky at night;2019-01-20 23:40:00;10 seconds;Black chevron-shaped object with no lights observed over Lexington, Ky at night I was standing in front of my house watching the lunar eclipse when I became aware of a chevron shaped object in my peripheral vision, moving southwest to northeast.  It was black with no lights and I was only aware of it because it was a bit darker than the sky because of the full moon.  As it traveled across the sky, there was the faintest of sounds, but it wasn’t the sound of an engine or any thing like that.  It was the sound of air being pushed out of the way, like if you were spinning something heavy in a circle using a rope.  It traveled across the sky as far as I could see southwest to as far as I could see northeast before disappearing across the rooftops.  I have no idea about the size because I couldn’t judge altitude.  It appeared to be large and far away, not small and close.  It travelled about 3 miles in 8-10 seconds, which would mean a speed of over 1000mph, but there was no sonic boom.  I’m a 52 year old software developer with pilot training and good eyesight.  I have no idea what I saw.  Definitely not a plane, not a drone.  Not a flock of birds.;38.0115012394512;-84.4536810917737
