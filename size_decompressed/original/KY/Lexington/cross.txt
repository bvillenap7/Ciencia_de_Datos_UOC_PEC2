As I was driving home from work, heading south on Interstate 75, just inside of Fayette County, I saw what looked like an airplane without wings.  It was as high as the clouds and totally white in color.  There was a line down the middle.  I could see no windows.  The object was going as fast as a plane.  It flew through a cloud and came out the other side.  There were no markings.  The object was smooth. It was flying away from me, I guess that would be in the direction of west, since I saw it outside of my drivers window.  There were other cars on the interstate, and I wondered how many others noticed this object.;38.0115012394512;-84.4536810917737
Transparent  cross shaped object  at high altitude caught glare from sun and vanished seconds later;2008-07-02 16:20:00;2 minutes;Transparent  cross shaped object  at high altitude caught glare from sun and vanished seconds later While working in the yard this afternoon I happened to look up at our second floor window, above which i seen an object in the sky that appeared semi transparent, its shape was similar to a small aircraft with no tail section but it looked as if it was made of glass. After sighting the object it moved in a way that caught glare from the sun making it more detailed for a second or two. I was able to see what appeared to be internal beams along the longer rectangular section and then it faded away and I lost sight of it. The object was very high up I would guess between 15 and 20 thousand feet up. The sky was perfectly clear not even high clouds. ((NUFORC Note:  Please see illustration on the NUFORC website.
