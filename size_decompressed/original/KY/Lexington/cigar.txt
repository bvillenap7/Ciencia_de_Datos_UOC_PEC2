The odd thing about this is the craft had no blinking lights and apeared to be moving (traveling) width way not length way.;38.0115012394512;-84.4536810917737
Large orange/red glowing cigar shaped object seen off Man O' War blvd.;2006-05-15 19:00:00;seconds;Large orange/red glowing cigar shaped object seen off Man O' War blvd. This sighting happened approximately one year ago. I was driving down Man O'War Blvd one evening at around 7 or 8 pm, returning from my University.  I turned right onto Winchester Rd by the channel 36 news station headed towards Paris.  I love the scenery out in that area, and turned my head to look at one of the beautiful farms there.   Right above the horizon at a distance I cannot even begin to calculate was a very large cigar shaped object that was glowing a radiant reddish orange color.  It looked to me like a huge metallic blimp that was catching the setting sun or something.  The road, being heavy with traffic at that time was not to be ignored, so I looked back at the road as to not rear end someone.  I looked back over at the sky, and the object was no longer there.  This object was clearly and obviously there a few seconds earlier.  I have tried to justify every possible explanation....maybe the sun reflecting off of some kind of cloud.... Whatever it was it was very strange. I haven't told anyone about this because of fear of ridicule. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
