I saw a triangular aircraft moving slowly and noislessly East to West.;1997-07-03 22:30:00;less than two minutes;I saw a triangular aircraft moving slowly and noislessly East to West. On the evening of 3 JUL 97, I was taking out the trash. I walked basically south from the back of my home and placed the trash in the herbie. When I turned around, facing north, I could see a traingular shaped craft moving slowly east to west. I was able to tell its shape by the way it blacked out the starfield in the sky. It had a row of soft green dashes down the forward two edges, three on each edge. It appeared to pass in front of the house, but I was unable to get a sense of depth, so I could'nt tell if it was a large craft far away or a small one close. There is an airport about five miles from where I live, so we're used to aircraft noise. There was no noise that I could hear, not even that soft blowing sound of a high flying jet. It moved slowly westward until it disappeared behind the treeline. Th whole thing lasted less than two minutes. I attended the Thunder over Louisville air/fireworks show the next day. They had the 117-A Stealth Aircraft on display and the B1-B Stealth Bomber made a pass over the crowd at the event. Perhaps what I saw was the craft flying in for the show.;38.0115012394512;-84.4536810917737
Triangular craft with bright white lights across the back and flashing red light near front tip;2001-02-08 18:50:00;1 minute;Triangular craft with bright white lights across the back and flashing red light near front tip My daughter and I were driving on Harrodsburg Road heading east toward Lexington passing the Palomar Center whan my daughter noticed lights in the sky behind Palomar.  I looked up and saw a string of white lights with 3 bright ones with several dimmer ones in between.  There was a red light flashing away from the white lights.  The craft seemed stationary , however I could not make out the shape as I was driving.  I pulled up to a red traffic light about 15 to 20 seconds later and got out of the car and it was gone.  My daughter got a better look at it than I did and describes it as a triangular craft with the white lights along the back and the red light toward the front tip.  It made no noise.  We were less than 1/2 mile from the craft and it appeared to be only 300 to 500 feet high.  Judging from the spacing of the lights I saw I would say it was about 250 to 300 feet across the back.  It was pointed East by Northeast.  It was dark out and the craft was dark in color except for the lights.;38.0115012394512;-84.4536810917737

Other lights on bottom and side as well.  Slight but interesting hum sound.  It was visible for 1-2 min. It was so awesome I lost track of time.;38.0115012394512;-84.4536810917737

Close encounter of the really close kind?;2011-08-15 03:20:00;2 hours;Close encounter of the really close kind?  The craft was triangular.   I do not remember much this is really freaky.  I was laying in bed  after a long night of studying I heard something like crickets and a pulse sound then a blue light and a tunnel vortex type thing, and I couldn't move.  I do remember seeing a triangle craft that I was heading to,next thing I know it is 5:15 AM, and I am back in my bed.  I lost 2 hours, I remember a lot - electricity running through me as a blue light, I could hear it and see it.    Maybe it is just a vivid dream but for some reason I feel it is not.;38.0115012394512;-84.4536810917737
Triangle shaped craft over lexington ky;2012-04-02 23:49:00;1 minute;triangle shaped craft over lexington ky Monday evening after the ball team won I was outside in my driveway. I could hear the entire town going crazy. Students were screaming and yelling. Sirens of every type was going off. I could smell a little smoke in the air, I knew they had started burning stuff. I could not see the crowd from where I was standing between two homes. The sky was clear no clouds. The moon was bright. I saw a helicopter circling downtown. Then two more joined the first one. I was watching them when I saw a feint shape over downtown. As my eyes focused in I could see a triangular shape. As I watched it I could see a large dark triangle. But you actually couldnâ€™t see the dark part it matched the sky. The three points of the craft had a glow on the underside. May have been the city lights reflecting off it. Made it look like three smaller triangles. That had a slight really light gray shine on the bottom. All flying in a perfect triangle. As it went almost directly over me I could not hear any sound. It was like it was gliding across the sky. It was a little lower than the moon when it passed over. I could see what looked like the side but it was dark to. I never saw any type of light coming from the craft. As it passed over I could no longer see three small triangles. All I could see was two small triangles. I watched them until I could not see them anymore. It came in from the north east over downtown and headed toward the airport.;38.0115012394512;-84.4536810917737

Couple noted a black, triangular shape object hovering above her house.  ((NUFORC Note:  Case from MUFON Case Man. System.  PD));2014-07-15 23:59:00;2 minutes;Couple noted a black, triangular shape object hovering above her house. Witnesses were lounging in the grass of the backyard with their dogs when the lady noted a black, triangular shape object hovering above her house.  They were both laying on their backs and it was directly above them in the sky.   She looked at it for at least a minute before pointing it out to her boyfriend, who then also studied it...he confirmed that it was black (or at least dark) and triangular shaped.  It seemed to be pointing in an easterly direction...as they lay there discussing it for at least another minute.  They watched the object slowly rotate (as if on an axis) in the completely opposite direction (west) - making no noise and showing no fuel trails- and then it was just gone.
