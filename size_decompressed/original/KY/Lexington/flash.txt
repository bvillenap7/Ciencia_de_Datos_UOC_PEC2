This event had been totally forgotten until Dec 29 2002. My brother-in-law phoned me to ask if I remebered seeing the UFO this past summer. I had no idea what he was talking about. He had only remembered because his wife had asked him about it that night. She did NOT see it. We had told her about it. After he began describing what had happened, I said Oh my gosh! I had totally forgotten. Here is the little bit that I do recall. It was a hot summer night and we had gone outside . It was late and we were just enjoying the clear star filled night. I was visiting my sister and brother-in-law and life was good. All I remember so far is the bright streak of whitish light a loud boom like an explosion then the light stayed for a couple of seconds then it was gone. The whole thing lasted maybe 30 seconds. If we had not been looking up at the night sky, we would have only heard the boom, but it so happens we saw it and heard it. Our reactions were Oh my gosh what did we just see? What was that? . We expected people to come outside to see what the boom was but no one did. We went inside woke up my sister and told her we thought we'd just seen a UFO. Like I said, this was totally forgotten and never mentioned again until last night Dec. 29. My memory is not good about what we saw in detail but I definitely, positively remember the reactions we had to what we saw. I remember the emotion experienced rather than the sighting. Thank you for your time and consideration. Sorry I couldn't be of greater assistance. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));38.0115012394512;-84.4536810917737
