It was between 12am and 2am, I'm not certain the exact time.  I was staring into the sky when a oval shape appeared, in the front of the oval was fluorescent green and the back of the oval was fluorescent orange.  The orange could have been the tracer of a propulsion system.  The shape darted across the sky with speed I have never scene and in 3 seconds it stopped mid air and the lights went off.  After the lights went off I could see a black oval float in the air for about 8 seconds before vanishing.  If I hadn't been following the object while it was illuminated I would have never spotted it while it was black.  I have absolutely no explanation for what I saw but it was not a comet event though it had a tracer.  Comets don't light up then go dark and hover before disappearing altogether.  I will say this was perhaps the most extraordinary thing I have ever seen in my entire life.  The event left me aw! estruck.;38.0115012394512;-84.4536810917737
White, shimmery, oval, very large, hovering object.  ((anonymous report));2017-03-07 20:00:00;2 minutes;White, Shimmery, Oval, very Large Hovering object Walked outside to unpack car, and suddenly felt as if I was being watched.  Looked up and saw a large bright white oval shape in the southern direction.   Stared at it for several seconds, but it didn't appear to move.  Bent down into car, then back up, and it was still there.   Then I pulled a few more things out of the car, and when I stood up it was gone.  It looked like a full moon that had been pushed into an oval disc.  It was very large and shimmery white. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Bright green oval light with orange halo shoots across Lexington sky.  ((anonymous report));2017-06-26 01:00:00;15-20 seconds;Bright green oval light with orange halo shoots across Lexington sky. Three friends and I were sitting on our back porch having a cigarette and two of us facing towards our left and their right jumped up and pointed it out.   Myself and the other friend quickly spun around to see a bright green oval shooting across the sky encompassed by an orange halo that quickly shot to the tree line to my left and out of sight.

Size of a XL drone with a light bar that strobes red/white;2019-12-06 00:12:00;40 seconds;Size of a XL drone with a light bar that strobes red/white I was laying down looking out my window and I noticed a red & white light in the sky.  My window faces a hospital and I see heli's fly in and out but this one was different.  It was heading in a direction towards my view.  I still thought it was a heli but as it got closer the lights were FORSURE not of a helicopter.  It was 1 bar of lights that had the bent shape of a gibbons moon. The lights were red and white.  They were NOT blinking but flashed like a strobe. I jerked myself up out of bed and ran to my window and noticed that whatever was in the sky was making NO SOUND. ***it's important to know that sound is actually perceived louder at night. I barely got a good look at it before it swept by out of my view. It was hard to make out the shape around these lights.  It's even harder to remember even though I am typing this only 20 minutes after seeing it.  My best guess after I first saw it was a drone.;38.0115012394512;-84.4536810917737
