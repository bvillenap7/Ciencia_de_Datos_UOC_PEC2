ATC Atlanta Center UFO warning near Lexington /  Knoxville, Wed 18 Feb 04, evasive maneuvers by AA pilot;2004-02-18 21:30:00;unknown;ATC Atlanta Center UFO warning near Lexington/Knoxville, Wed 18 Feb 04, evasive maneuvers by AA pilot Air traffic control Atlanta Center reported an object between Lexington, KY and Knoxville, TN that had changing lights (red, blue, green, white, etc.) in the sky on Wednesday evening around 21:30 EST.  An American Airlines pilot reported that he had to make evasive maneuvers to avoid collision with the object (flight # unknown at this time).  Numerous pilots in that frequency sector commented on their visual of the object, as well as ground reports from atc.  Apparently the evasive maneuvers had everyone in the air on high alert, including the witness (Major in USAF Reserves and commercial pilot). ATC Atlanta should be able to confirm this.;38.0115012394512;-84.4536810917737
very large round object, pulsing red light, stationary within the storm with 60-70 MPH winds;2004-07-14 20:45:00;5 minutes;very large round object, pulsing red light, stationary within the storm with 60-70 MPH winds We were inside watching TV when we head strong winds whipping about so I went out on the back pation to see how bad it was. There was a lot of what I call heat lightning because it did not come down. In the middle of allof the lightning there was a red light pulsing in the clouds. One, two three, pause, one, two, pause, one two three so I knew it wasn't lightning and there are no TV, radio, or cell phone towers anywhere nearby, So I called my mother out to see it before it went away. She saw it and couldn't tell what it was either. Then it suddenly stopped pulsing and since it was above the cloud line disappeared. About a minute later the winds gusted up to about 60-70 MPH and some of our potted plants and plants in the garden started to snap so we started putting them in a protected area when almost directly above us the red pulsing started again. It was still above the clouds, but when it pulsed the shape was perfectly round and about 1/4 to a 1/2 mile across. The clouds were moving very quickly and the winds kept increasing but the object was stationary. It pulsed slowly three times and then stopped and dissapeared. As soon as it did the winds began to die down dramatically. We went inside and turned on a local TV channel and even though a news report was not on there was a small map in the corner of the screen showing which counties were under a severe thunderstorm alert. The map then changed to a doppler radar image that showed the squall line stretching across the area, and right over our area there was a perfectly round image wider than the squall line and in the center of the storm.;38.0115012394512;-84.4536810917737
Distant white luminous object with red and blue flashing lights stationary for one hour, afterwards moving very slowly.;2007-05-07 21:30:00;Still out there at 23:00.;Distant white luminous object with red and blue flashing lights stationary for one hour, afterwards moving very slowly. 	At about 9:30 PM today, my mother, brother, and myself went outside to admire Venus, which is quite brilliant tonight. We then saw something far more remarkable toward the south, about midway up in the sky from the horizon. It was much smaller and not at all as bright, but it was distinctly flashing. At first, we took it to be a plane, but we quickly realized that it was completely stationary. What on Earth could do that? 	We looked at it through binoculars, and still could not figure it out. The lights were flashing very rapidly, with a blue one on one side and a red one on the other that alternated. Both were backed by a white light that did not seem to flash. Since it was so far away, we could not make out any real shape to it, though it seemed to me to be a bit narrow, like a grain of rice. 	I attempted to photograph it, but my camera is not good enough to pick up stars at all, let alone odd flashing things. At 10:20 PM, it was still out there in the exact same place. At 11:00, we checked again, and saw that it had moved far above and west of its previous position. Its lights were now flashing on a diagonal instead of being horizontally oriented toward the ground. The surrounding stars had not moved as much. It was hard to tell, but it seemed to be moving very gradually continuing in the same direction in which it had moved before. It is probably still out there. 	It is highly uncharacteristic for any of us to go staring at the sky here (light pollution makes stargazing unfeasible), and we only did so because Venus was so irresistably bright. My brother in particular is a very pragmatic person and normally scoffs at anything fantastical, yet he stood out there watching this object longest of all. This is absolutely the first time any of us has ever seen anything inexplicable in the night sky, and we are not particularly interested in UFOs. I have never even heard the others mention them. However, we are now very interested in this one! Even if it turns out to be nothing, we hope to somehow find out more.;38.0115012394512;-84.4536810917737
Starlike object gives dazzling light show.;2008-12-14 18:03:00;15 minutes;Starlike object gives dazzling light show. I had walked out my front door to smoke a cigerette, when a what I thought at first was a very bright star caught my eye.  It was very bright, far brighter than the other stars but what I thought was odd was that there was fairly thick cloud cover that night and when the clouds thickened, it blotted out all the neighboring celestial bodies but not this star.  As I watched perpelexed it rapidly crossed the sky from East to West in a very rapid motion.   I ran inside and got my girlfriend and her digital camera.  We watched the light for about ten other minutes. It changed it's postion several times.  It lowered it's altitude and then would slowly raise back, it also slowly floated back and forth across the sky. Then a plane flew by and it dimmed itself rapidly, when the plane past it grew very bright.  I thought this was caused by the cloud cover but at that moment it was in a clear patch of sky.  It did this several times and them it dimmed itself and vanished.  I grew up watching planes and helicopters and I know that's not what this was,  I don't know what this was but it behaved differently than anything that I've ever seen.;38.0115012394512;-84.4536810917737
Strange orange light over Lexington, KY;2010-11-07 03:35:00;1:00 - 1:30;Strange orange light over Lexington, KY When first spotted, it moved in fast motion from left to right across the sky.  At first, mistaken to be an airplane, but after observing for several seconds, appeared to be otherwise. Orange light, abruptly stopped and stayed in place.  Then slowly disappeared and was no longer visible.;38.0115012394512;-84.4536810917737
Two red lights seen moving near each other until disappearing.;2012-07-04 23:30:00;2 minutes;Two red lights seen moving near each other until disappearing. While watching fireworks I noticed two red lights that were stationary.  I asked if my friend could see them too, they confirmed.  I continued to watch for 30 seconds or so after noticing them to see if they were just lights or something else.  They both moved slowly, one moving upward the other down, confirming they were not just lights.  They came to a full stop then started to fade away.  I'm not sure if they were moving away or just faded out of the visible light spectrum.  The whole thing lasted roughly 2 minutes.;38.0115012394512;-84.4536810917737

Single bright light the size of a large star moving faster than jet with no sound.;2015-04-22 23:05:00;8 seconds;Single bright light the size of a large star moving faster than jet with no sound On Wed., 4/22, at 11:05pm, my 41 year old son (career military) and I were looking at the moon with a telescope.  There were scattered lower clouds.   While he was looking in the scope, I was looking at the sky.  Suddenly, I noticed a bright, white  light, about the size of a large star, pass from my right to left in an open, cloud free space in the sky.  I quickly got my sonâ€™s attention.  He looked up and saw it two seconds before it went behind a cloud.  I watched to see if it would come out the other side and it did not.   It was moving faster than a jet and made no sound.  There were no flashing lights.   The event lasted about 8 seconds.;38.0115012394512;-84.4536810917737
Two extremely large red lights on a diagonal blinking simultaneously and moving very slowly for about 10 minutes.  No sound.;2015-06-04 22:50:00;10 minutes;Two extremely large red lights on a diagonal blinking simultaneously and moving very slowly for about 10 minutes. No sound. I am a retired 64 year old woman, and not crazy!   I was walking the dogs at 10:30pm.  I noticed two very large red lights blinking simultaneously about 5-600 (maybe more) feet apart on a diagonal.   I quickly put the dogs in the house and grabbed my cell phone to film the unusual lights.  Nothing seemed to be showing up on my phone at all.  (Later, I was able to capture a section of the video that shows light streaks and not the two red orbs.)   I continued to watch them until they were out of sight - about 10 minutes.  There was no sound, and they were moving extremely slow.  They stayed in the same formation the entire time.   These lights were too large to be from any plane and the angle was like nothing I have seen before.  Had it been a plane, I would have heard some kind of sound and the lights would not have been on a diagonal or as large as they were.   I have never seen anything fly this slowly and still stay in the air. This is my second sighting in Lexington.  The last unusual sighting was a large white light - like a very large star - that moved very quickly with no sound.;38.0115012394512;-84.4536810917737
Large, bright, orange constant light about 2000 ft up, traveling East to West over Lexington during fireworks with no sound.;2017-07-04 22:15:00;60 seconds;Large, bright, orange constant light about 2000 ft up, traveling East to West over Lexington during fireworks, with no sound. I was sitting on the steps watching the kids shoot off fireworks. I notice a very large, bright, orange constant light about 2000 feet up moving East to West over us.  I yelled to the boys in the street to look up and said, Hey guys, what's that?   I watched it for 60 seconds.  The speed was faster than a single engine plane and made no sound.   Occurred at approximately 10:15pm.;38.0115012394512;-84.4536810917737

Felt compelled to step out into my backyard, overlooking the University of Kentucky. Glowing elongated orb caught my eye.  Glowing, elongated orb, flashing white multi-colors: Kept bursting with energy/more light output. Then, changing of colors. Predominantly orangish-red from warm white. May have caught a blueish flash as well. As i write this, it is still visible. Now 35 minutes, although it has moved South slightly.  This craft is one of dozens I have witnessed over the decades in many locales, beginning in the 1960's.;38.0115012394512;-84.4536810917737

I am drawn/compelled to step outside to observe this orb-like shape flash 3-4 different colors, strobe and make quick, small changes in location.  I reported on one sighting invited a visiting friend to step out for a 2nd sighting I felt (verifiable) and same tonight, alone.  Appears to be same craft.  Note: huge upsurge in helicopter activity recently, as well.;38.0115012394512;-84.4536810917737
