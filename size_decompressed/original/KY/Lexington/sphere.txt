Twenty white objects spotted hovering over University of Kentucky campus;2004-12-03 15:00:00;2 MINUTES;Twenty white objects spotted hovering over University of Kentucky campus On the third of December, after exiting our classroom building, my friend and I noticed about twenty white, floatinging orb-like objects in the sky. The were moving around, and when our view became obstructed by a tree, we ran to see them again -- but they were gone. Did anyone else see them around the UK campus? We need to know what those things were!;38.0115012394512;-84.4536810917737
Unidentified Red Glowing Object over south Lexington, KY;2011-04-07 21:00:00;5 minutes;Unidentified Red Glowing Object over south Lexington, KY I was sitting on my balcony around 9:00pm yesterday working on Facebook on my android phone.  I noticed a light in the sky through my right eye.  So I looked up and at about a 70 degree angle from the horizon was a very bright red glowing abject of moderate size.  I sit on the balcony at night all the time because I smoke, but not in the house.  I have seen many airplanes and helicopters in the night sky and this was definitely not one of them.  I was amazed at what I was seeing so I took some video with my android phone.   The video can be found on my youtube page at  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99dmCinUt6Q  I live in south Lexington, Ky.  The object moved due east, then vanished approximately 10 degrees in the sky before reaching the horizon.;38.0115012394512;-84.4536810917737
Orange orbs flying at 500 feet elevation in a formation.  Three in a line and a fourth trailing behind;2011-06-28 23:00:00;approx 2 min;Orange orbs flying at 500 feet elevation in a formation.  Three in a line and a fourth trailing behind I was upstairs in bed when my friend came up after viewing late nite news at approximately 11:50 pm on June 28, 2011.  He screamed at me from the other upstairs bedroom to come and see these objects.  They were four orange orbs flying in formation at a low altitude towards our home..about 500 feet above ground-helicopter flight space for our police helicopters..there were three in a line around 50 yards apart and one behind around 100 yards flying directly behind the middle orb.  We rushed downstairs and watched.  They executed a 45 degree turn and crossed our yard at a slow speed...never changing formation.  They were the size of the full moon about three quarters up in the sky and there was movement inside like moving crystals..sooo hard to describe and the air was disturbed around them..Very scary. There was absolutely no sound from the objects.  I went inside and got my camara.  I was very excited and fumbling with the camera.  I managed to get them in s! ight as they moved over the houses behind my home.  I was so upset I forgot to take the flash off.  When I took the picture the sky lit up and the back orb went out...just like that...Then as they moved on it came back on more dimly.  Unfortunately, the flash blackened out the sky and took a pic of my patio umbrella which was in the side forground of the pic.  We called the police, a tv station and I spoke with an air traffic controller at the airport, but at that time no one had reported these things.  We later checked chinese laterns, but these things were under control.  They stayed in formation and one extinguished the light in response to my camera flash!  We have sketches of what we saw.;38.0115012394512;-84.4536810917737
Four orange balls flying very low with three in a line and a fourth behind moved slowly across sky with absloutely no noise.;2011-06-29 23:50:00;no more than 2 minutes;Four orange balls flying very low with three in a line and a fourth behind moved slowly across sky with absloutely no noise. We observed four orange balls moving slowly at a very low altitude over our home at about 11:50 pm on June 28, 2011.   Three balls were in a line and a fourth was behind making a triangle appearance.  They were first observed out the bedroom window.  We ran outside our home and as they came by there was absolutely no sound.   Visibility in Lexington was very far and the sky was clear.  We could see airplanes high in the sky at the time.  These were very very low.  They moved off and disappeared in the distance.   Can't believe  we saw this.  We have no idea what they were.  I could not get a camera quick enough to take a picture.;38.0115012394512;-84.4536810917737
Orange-colored bright lights or dots high in SE sky 8-10 pairs moving slowly, independently in Z formation;2013-09-28 22:25:00;6-8 minutes;Orange-colored bright lights or dots high in SE sky 8-10 pairs moving slowly, independently in Z formation I live on the southeastern outskirts of Lexington KY.  High in the southeastern sky around 10:25 pm, were 8 â€“ 10 sets of orange/amber colored bright lights or dots.  In pairs of twos in a Z shaped formation, they moved slowly but not in unison (the pairs did not seem to be like headlights).  Some disappeared and reappeared, moving slowly up/down or sideways, but not down others were constant.  By the time I pulled out of traffic, there were only two independent ones left, and they were fading.  They just faded out one by one. I observed all of this for about 8 minutes (while driving and stopping on road.  (The orange dots were already in the sky when I noticed them, so do not know how long they were totally visible).  When I first saw lights in the sky as making a 90 degree left turn, I thought it was fireworks up in the sky, but quickly realized nothing had been shot upward and nothing was falling back down, as in fireworks.  (Fireworks were a concern to me since my dog would keep me awake all night if she heard one firework.)  Personal demographics  Very educated, professional Caucasian female, work in high-level technology and would never believe I would be filing a report like this.  Until you see something entirely unexplained, it is hard to fathom.  I am early sixties, working full time as a partner in a start-up nation-wide technology/cyber security business.  I will email a graphic separately.;38.0115012394512;-84.4536810917737

Fast moving grey mass spherical not defined hot looking orange aura bottom edge no lights complete stop and direction change 3 times.;2014-11-18 05:35:00;10 seconds;Fast moving grey mass spherical not defined hot looking orange aura bottom edge no lights complete stop and direction change 3 times. Stepped outside to watch the Leonid meteor shower for a while, was staring straight up towards the radiant in the constellation Leo, movement to the right of me SW.  Glanced over to my right and saw a fast moving object lightly orange like metal starting to get hot but not bright moving Southwest to South in direction.   I thought  we'll that's no Leonid meteor and did a double take because it never flared up or fireballed like I was seeing, plus it was moving in the wrong direction for the meteor shower.   So I continued to watch it move and noticed that it had shape, like a grey mass, spherical but not defined.  I thought maybe it was an owl, but it was orange hot on the bottom edge.  Then it stopped dead still in the sky, thats when the hair on my neck stood up.   It stopped, and made an immediate change in direction due South for about 1 second, then stopped again, changed direction again and moved East, stopped a third time and then just accelerated incredibly fast South out of sight.  If it was an owl, it had a hot rear end and had reason to move that fast.  Pretty incredible sighting. A first for me and I'm an amateur astomomer, I am always looking up at the night sky.;38.0115012394512;-84.4536810917737
