laser lights in kentucky;1975-06-06 22:00:00;20 minutes;laser lights in kentucky This was in the mid seventies.  I was about 8-9 years old.  My friend and I were on our way home from playing in the neighborhood.  We looked up and all we could see was what I believe now as the bottom of the craft...it was huge! There was one big circle and several small circles around the big circle...it was a circle of rotating colorful lights.  There was no sound. We were afraid and hid behind our neighbors camper. The neighbors had a row of bushes and we looked over to the bushes and from behind the bushes..what I would describe as a laser light was coming over the bush and disappearing before it hit the ground. The laser light looked like little red squares. This was way before I knew anything about laser's or anything like that. The craft was so big we could not see the sky...all we saw were rotating lights. We eventually took off and ran home. I remember running home crying and my dad made me draw exactly what I had saw. I know that UFO's exist because I know what I saw when I was a child. I've tried to find out if anyone else has seen the laser beam lights.

Dark orange, circular, stationary object;2004-10-31 19:00:00;15 min;Dark orange, circular, stationary object While taking the kids around trick or treating, we observed a dark orange circular object about the size of your thumbnail with your arm outstretched could been seen about 35 degrees above the horizon to the WSW. The object remained stationary and did not vary in brightness. We pointed it out to some other parents in the area, then we all observed the object until a cloud passed in front of it, blocking our view.  At the time we assumed it was a hot air balloon, but couldn't imagine a balloon flying at night. It definitely was not the sun or moon and it was much larger than a star. It did not have any white, red, or green lights typical of aircraft.  I forgot about it until I heard Peter Davenport on Coast-to-Coast AM say that others had reported seeing a similar object. Aliens? I doubt it, but definitely a UFO.;38.0115012394512;-84.4536810917737
A roundish disk encircled with blue lights and two larger red lights over my car  I couldn't believe it even when I was looking at it.;2005-12-02 18:20:00;1 minute;A roundish disk encircled with blue lights and two larger red lights over my car  I couldn't believe it even when I was looking at it. I was driving in my car when I saw a bright light in the sky to my left that looked like a huge star.  It hovered there for a few seconds, then disappeared behind some houses.  Then the bright light was on my right in the sky, though I hadn't gone around any major curves.  Then it started to decend from the sky.  It looked like a plane crashing right at me.  I stopped the car.  The thing stopped and flew over me very slowly.  It looked like a roundish disk and had blue lights in a circle around it and two red lights on it.  Then it went back up into the sky really fast & disappeared.  It made no noise that I can remember.  I have never seen anything like this before.  I am completely weirded out by it.

orange light;2011-07-30 23:10:00;45 seconds;I saw a bright orange light about size of softball and a tiny orange dot north of it. I then saw a blinking object, probably a plane fly out left from orange dot.  The orange dot then faded away.   I then looked around and saw another possible plane just like the other blinking light heading away in different direction.   Did planes collide or was a meteor shot down?!   Fireball in the sky and two other objects. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));38.0115012394512;-84.4536810917737
Two red/orange orbs moving south to north over east side of Lexington, KY no sounds;2013-03-29 23:30:00;~10 minutes;Two red/orange orbs moving south to north over east side of Lexington, KY no sounds At approximately 11:30 pm EDST (23.30) on the east side of Lexington, Kentucky, on March 29, 2013: My small dog was agitated at the back door, barking excitedly, which is uncharacteristic for her. When I went to see what the matter was, she was excitedly indicating that she wanted to go outside. Normally she will just sit at the door patiently waiting if she wants to go outside.  I let her out, and followed onto the back deck as she descended the steps into the back yard. It was at that point that I noticed a red orb hovering stationary slightly to the north of me, high in the sky. It was too large to be the red wing light of an airplane. It did not move as I observed it for perhaps 30 to 60 seconds. I went inside to get my iphone in order to take a picture, and it was still visible when I returned, but had started moving very slowly in a northerly direction.  I took pictures and a short video (or thought I did this morning those pictures and video do not appear on my phone, but two others, taken later from the upstairs deck are on my phone.)  My wife had already gone to bed, so I went upstairs to our bedroom, woke her up and told her what I was seeing. There is a second floor deck off our bedroom, and we went there, where the object was still clearly visible, continuing to slowly move in a northerly direction.  I then saw a second identical object which was much closer to us, but about the same apparent altitude, moving south to north. This second object was slightly to the west of us, but nearly overhead. It was moving slowly toward the location of the first object. When we looked back to the last location of the first object, it was no longer visible.  We watched the second object move very slowly—much too slowly for a fixed wing aircraft—in the same south to north trajectory. Eventually the second object disappeared as we watched. It did not go off into the distance, it just disappeared. The apparent size of the objects was the same. My recollection is that at the first sighting of the second object it was about the size of a dime held at arm’s  length. My wife’s recollection is that it was larger, i.e. about the size of a quarter held at arm’s length. We agree that the apparent size was smaller than a full moon. The moon, at the time, was far east of these objects, which were high in the sky as opposed to near the horizon. Unquestionably these objects were not stars, both because of size and the fact that they moved.  As to color, I saw both objects as being red. My wife saw them as being orange, although she also saw what appeared to be a small red “dot” in the center of both objects. I did not observe this “dot”.  Regarding photographs: This morning I looked at the photos on my camera. To my great surprise, there was no video whatsoever, and only one still shot of one of the objects. It appears to be the second one, due to it’s apparent size in the photo. The photo was taken at full zoom on an iphone 5. When the photo itself is enlarged, the object does not appear to be an orb at all, but rather appears to have a crescent shape, with curve on the bottom, but with the top tilted slightly to the west. Upon closer inspection, we thought it appeared to have a “saucer” shape, with the bright crescent being at the bottom. It is also possible the impression appears because of something which may be the “red dot” appears above the crescent. I have not magnified the photo beyond what I can do by zooming into the photo with the iphone. The color of the crescent in the photo is much more white than the appearance of the color to our naked eyes. As I said, I would call it red, although tending toward an orange-ish red as opposed to bright red, while my wife says the color was orange with a “red dot”.  The other photo is completely black, as if only a picture of the night sky. I am baffled as to why there are only two still photos on my phone from last night, and no video whatsoever. I am certain I shot both, downstairs as well as upstairs. My wife thinks that I may have failed to properly take the shots due to my excitement, but I disagree. I clearly recall both the action the phone does after taking a still shot, as well as seeing the video icon active.  At no time was there any sound heard from these objects, at least by we humans. It may be that the dog heard something which caused her agitation.  Backgrounds of the observers: I am an attorney. My wife is a dental tech. I am in my early 60’s my wife is in her late 50’s.;38.0115012394512;-84.4536810917737
A very bright light that moved quickly and low across a large distance.;2014-07-09 23:04:00;3 minutes;A very bright light that moved quickly and low across a large distance. i was looking out my window when i noticed a large bright light to low for a star and to bright and fast to be a plane it moved at great speed and made very sharp turns in a zigzag pattern from side to side the light was not flashing either it was a steady bright white or very pale blue light.  i was not a ufo, alien believer or serious beliver until tonight, what i saw was very strange and a bit scary i have seen many planes in the sky before and this did not look like a plane what really gave it away was the turns and speed of turns;38.0115012394512;-84.4536810917737

I saw a round shaped object with white, yellow, red lights moving.;2017-04-25 23:00:00;12 minutes;Last night, 4-25-17, about 11:00 pm, I was looking at the stars.  I saw a round shaped object with white, yellow, red lights, moving not in a normal way an air craft would.  It moved up down and to the sides in seconds.   Next thing I know, it started moving close to my balcony has if it knew I was watching.  It got close to the street.  It was hovering, the birds on the tree scattered and I ran inside scared...  Couldn't believe what I had just witnessed.   Put me in a lie detector test.  I know what I saw.  It lasted about 12 minutes.  Try to capture with my cell, I just couldn't, it moved too fast.  Never thought this will happen to me.  The images are vivid in my mind.  I actually ran inside my house.  That's how scared I was. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and she sounded to be quite sincere about the sighting.  PD));38.0115012394512;-84.4536810917737

Immediately I heard a chopper fly around my house then saw it meet disc head-on and tilt downward to right as the disc just vanished.  My rental neighbor behind me was leaving her house with dog for a walk and both she and dog looked up at chopper also.  It was loud and low.  I tried to tell mufon but email won't go thru.  I have seen these silver disc before years ago flying around an air force plane in maneuvers maybe.  We watched them for 30 min. I've never seen this in the city tho.   On my phone now not sure if this will go thru.  Last time I talked to any of you, 3 men 6'8 or taller came upon me and my infant children in parking lot and another man dressed like Lord of yesteryear old outdated clothing came upon us and scared me to my knees grocery store.  They were mad I talked to Professor Jacobs;38.0115012394512;-84.4536810917737

4 strange unidentified lights over Lexington, KY.;2017-07-08 23:30:00;3-5 minutes;4 strange unidentified lights over Lexington, KY. 3 of us had just arrived back at my step-daughter's appartment, when I noticed 4 circle shaped obj cts traveling southward in the sky.  They appeared to be 3000 to 5000ft or maybe higher.  They were white in color and had no aircraft marker lights.  I estimate that they were moving around 90 knots.   I didn't have my phone handy but did have a pair of binoculars in my car.  I grabbed them and zoomed in to only see 4 white round lights, and as before mentioned, there were no type of any aircraft marker/navigational lights on the objects.   As they continued southward towards the horizon, a neighbor approached and asked what were we looking at.  Once we told her, we gave her the binoculars, and she witnessed them as well.   When we first observed these 4 lights, the formation was one in front, then some space, then two closer together, and more space, and finally the fourth following.   There was absolutely no sound emitted from these craft or objects. Final visual on these! objects before last seen, with binoculars, they were in the southern sky, but their formation had changed and appeared in a pyramid form from left to right.   I do not believe they were any type of convential or earthly aircraft.   These objects were white circle lights without proper navigational lighting and again, emitted no sound at all.;38.0115012394512;-84.4536810917737
