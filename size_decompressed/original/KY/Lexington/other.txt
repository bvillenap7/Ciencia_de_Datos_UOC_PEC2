We observed the lights created a distinct boomerang shape. The UFO was flying overhead slowly until it came to a stop. The UFO then appeared to be lowering altitude towards us. It started moving away so we drove to try to keep it in view, but a building got in our way. When we finally saw the UFO again, it was already towards the horizon.;38.0115012394512;-84.4536810917737
Dark blue light moving sideways, but apparently suspended under something like a white parachute?;2009-03-17 23:15:00;1 min (passing by in car);Dark blue light moving sideways, but apparently suspended under something like a white parachute? At about 23:15, March 17, 2009, I saw a bright dark blue light in the skies, about 100’ (rough estimate) in the sky over a wooded area next to the freeway in Lexington, Ky.  The light was not extremely bright, like a police light or the sun, but rather like a blue runway light at the airport.  The light was steady and there were no other lights, flashing or otherwise.  It appeared as though the light might have been suspended under a small, white parachute, but it did not seem like the movement of the light was consistent with a parachute.  I only got a short look at it, since I was driving on the busy roadway, and I did not see any indication that anyone else noticed.;38.0115012394512;-84.4536810917737

Was sitting at a cafe table on the sidewalk talking with friends.  I leaned back in my chair and as I looked up and North a meteor shot down from high above and then to my surprise stopped dead above the Rupp Arena it had several lights but immediately turned them off and began to move in a straight line over the city towards Leestown Rd../ Georgetown Rd. area.  Could still see it from the city lights for just a few moments as it moved off but couldn't make out a clear shape.  Seen the same entry style with a triangular craft with orange lights on the bottom in Seattle a couple years ago.  I want to know what they are.;38.0115012394512;-84.4536810917737
Semi-length lights;2010-10-06 20:15:00;30 seconds;Semi-length lights It was right below Jupiter. I saw two lights that looked like the were on the ends of a semi truck ad it started moving to the right of Jupiter and then slowly the lights dimmed and went away.  There was no sound or anything.  I tried to take a video of it on my phone but my phone would shut off and it had a full battery.;38.0115012394512;-84.4536810917737
Almond shaped UFO flying back and forth from apartment for at least 5 minutes.;2013-08-13 23:00:00;5-10 minutes;Almond shaped UFO flying back and forth from apartment for at least 5 minutes. It was around august the 13th i want to say, the year was 2013.  Well one night i was in my apartment watching an episode of Scooby-Doo, i believe the one with the Harlem Globetrotters or the red bearded pirate guy.  Well anyway, i was watching scooby-doo and all of a sudden something outside caught my eye!  I got up to go and see what was out side and there i saw it! i saw this almost almond shaped thing flying probably a good 100-300 feet adjacent from my balcony.  At least that's what it looked like anyway.  It went back and forth and back and forth for about a good 5 minutes before going behind a tree and vanishing. We do get airplanes and helicopters that fly by allot though, but i know an airplane or helicopter when i see one! It made no noise or anything and airplanes can't go back and forth so easily with out major turns. It also had two sets of lights in three rows.  Blue, red and what i can only describe as moon light like color almost yellow or peach even. ((NUFORC Note:  For some reason, witness indicates that the date above is approximate.  Hoax??

Streak of light across Mars.;2014-04-19 20:30:00;1 second;Streak of light across Mars. At approximately 8:30 pm (04/19/14), I was sighting my telescope in on the planet mars.  The sun had set behind me (to the west) but the sky was still to bright to see anything in that direction, thus I was looking easterly.  At the time I was looking through a 40 mm lenses and using an 80mm telescope which gives approximately 10X magnification.  At this magnification mars fills about ½ the visual field. This is when something transited from right to left (south to north) through the field of view at what appears to be Mars’s equatorial region.  This is to say, it was observed in the field of view beyond Mars and passed somewhere between earth and Mars, exiting my field of view well past Mars.  Indicating it was NOT on Mars, but between Earth and Mars.  (Perhaps, this object was in Earth orbit?)  This pass lasted for only a fraction of a second and the object appeared white (I am color blind, but it appeared white to Mars’s red body with white polar caps as I see them.)  This object was tiny, almost appearing as a grain of sand. I immediately pulled my head back to see with my unaided eye, but saw only Mars.  (Note: no other planets nor stars were yet visible due to the fading sunset.)  My binoculars (25X70) were next to my telescope, so I grabbed them and scanned the area but saw nothing.  The object was gone. At this point, I ruled a lenses flair, the angle of the sun and my telescope was incorrect.  Due to the recent freezing temperatures, there were no insects flying around and insects have never been visible to me through that level of magnification.  I considered a satellite, but the orbit seems wrong and the app on my phone did not show any satellites in that vicinity. I am not entirely certain this was a craft…I do not know what it was, but if others saw this, I would like to validate their sighting.;38.0115012394512;-84.4536810917737
