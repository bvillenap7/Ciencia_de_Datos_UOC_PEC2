I was rideing my motorcycle on the beltline around the city so I had an unobstructed view of this object. I would say it was about 1/4 the size of the moon. It was of a steady brite blue-green color. It was stationary until it suddenly sped off to the north. It appeared to pulsate or strobe briefy as it sped away then disappeared. It was approximatly 45 degrees above the horizon. As a pilot I would estimates its distance from me was approximatly 5 miles. My motorcycle helmet has no face shield so there could not be a reflection.  ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
