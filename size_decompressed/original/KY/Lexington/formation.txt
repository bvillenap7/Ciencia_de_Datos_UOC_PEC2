It was one light then many, and then one again.;2014-10-29 08:55:00;5-10 minutes;It was one light then many, and then one again. I was on my front porch when I saw a single light staying motionless but was blinking rapidly like a helicopter, but then numerous small craft, blinking just like the mothership, began ejecting from the larger craft and then they started to perform erratic movements around the mothership and then after maybe 8 minutes they disappeared and the mothership started moving at a slow but constant straight path away from the area until it was out of sight.;38.0115012394512;-84.4536810917737
