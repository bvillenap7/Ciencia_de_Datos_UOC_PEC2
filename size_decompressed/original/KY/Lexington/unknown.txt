Heavy vibration over house, not attributable to aircraft of any kind.;2005-02-27 04:35:00;5 minutes;Heavy vibration over house, not attributable to aircraft of any kind. We live in an area where airplanes and helicopters regularly cross over our property and are used to those sounds. However, on this morning we were awakened from a sound sleep by a noise that was directly over our house and was like a grinding noise, like a stump grinder or shredder. It was NOT a helicopter or plane. It was definitely coming from above and not around, and upon getting up to see if there was anything around, noted that there were no lights on around the neighborhood, nor did the sound seem all-encompassing.  It seemed to be located directly over our house, toward the back bedroom area and lessened in intensity as I moved to the front and opposite end of the house. It seemed to make the house shudder, like a heavy vibration, but even though the sky was fairly clear, there was nothing in the sky when I got to the point where I could see out a window. I was afraid to go outside, because the noise was that threatening. My husband was as stunned as I and our daughter, who sleeps downstairs in the basement, was also awakened by the noise and the vibration. This is not the first time we have experienced what we believe to be extra-terrestrial events, though my husband and a friend witnessed the last event and have not posted it. My husband and I, though we have only been together since 1999, have both had previous experiences with ufos. We firmly believe this instance was another one.;38.0115012394512;-84.4536810917737
Five objects, moving North and South with a rocket exhaust suddenly vanish;2010-11-09 17:45:00;3 minutes;Five objects, moving North and South with a rocket exhaust suddenly vanish In a Walmart parking lot tonight I noticed what looked like plane on the horizon moving North.  It had what looked like a rocket exhaust, definitely not a contrail. Below that, moving South were two more of them, a little smaller but with the same look about them. Still lower was another moving North and finally a fifth object moving South. I kept watching them for over three minutes - they weren't moving that quickly.  Then they just vanished!  I left the parking lot in my vehicle and started driving home to the West.   I figured I'd see five planes eventually, explaining everything but never saw the objects again.;38.0115012394512;-84.4536810917737
