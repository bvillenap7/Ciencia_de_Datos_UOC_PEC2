Orange Fireball/Light seen in south Lexington /  Fayette County travelling from south to south east.;2013-07-26 21:46:00;~5 minutes;Orange Fireball/Light seen in south Lexington/Fayette County travelling from south to south east. I went outside of my home in southern fayette county (Buckhorn Drive and Alumni Drive for a smoke. Noticed a very bright orange light at a medium altitude (about 1000 - 3000 feet) to the due south moving at About 200 MPH. (roughly speed of a helicopter or light aircraft, perhaps a bit slower)  I thought that , perhaps, was landing light from aircraft or helicopter however it was completely silent and completely wrong color.  Bright sodium orange.  I watched for any flashing anti-collision lights and navigation lights.  I saw none.  Nor did I hear ANY engine nose of any kind. Observed object as it made a gentle right hand turn to the east.  (southeast from my location) then flickered out just before I lost sight of it behind nearby treeline. I live just half a mile from the Fayette county area VOR navigation station and under a main approach to Bluegrass field Airport.  I see many many many aircraft in the skies at any given time ranging from Air National Guard C-130's and helicopters to local Medivac flights to the occasional WW2 Aircraft  .. this was NOT any of them.   NOR was this any form of hot air balloon (moved too fast and very light winds)    I am Prior Service Marine and Plane spotter..  I know aircraft.;38.0115012394512;-84.4536810917737
