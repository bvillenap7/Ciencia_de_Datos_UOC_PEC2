I am the bigger child, and the other two are my brother and sister.  I was 4 or 5 and they were 2-3 years old.  None of us three noticed the thing in the sky at the time and until my mom passed recently, none of us ever would have.  A friend brought it to my attention not long ago after the funeral.  That is all I really know.  We are just curious if anyone can explain the thing or why it is in both pictures.  They were taken about 5 mins apart on the same day.
