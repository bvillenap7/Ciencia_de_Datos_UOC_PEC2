moving light comes to dead stop and gets super bright  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible flare from Iridium satellite.  PD));2011-06-30 23:00:00;1 hour;moving light comes to dead stop and gets super bright i was sitting on my porch and i saw a dim light moving across the sky. as soon as it got over me it came to a dead stop and lit up bright.   i ran and got the 2 other people here and when they came outside and looked at it, it made 1 super fast move up then stoped again. it has been in the same spot for 1 hour even though the stars in the sky have shifted already. while we were all outside watching it we saw 3 other dim lights and when they got past the bright one they vanished. i have seen the same light befor in another town. and everytime it gets above me it stops.im trying to see if anyone else has seen the same thing befor or if someone can tell me what it is. so im online tonight looking for answers. and to see if theres a reason ive seen the same thing in 2 towns 1 month apart exactly.
