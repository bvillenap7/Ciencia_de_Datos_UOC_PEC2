Sphere-like object coupled with two bright lights on each side viewed from a distance, Triangular base;2004-03-19 19:00:00;5 min;Sphere-like object coupled with two bright lights on each side viewed from a distance, Triangular base AT dusk, driving north on I-65 just south of Shepherdsville, saw at first what appeared to be two bright white lights with a sphere in the middle.  At first I assumed it was an airplane, but the lights seemed too bright and too close to the earth and not moving at all.  I thought from a distance I saw a brief flash or what looked like a spotlight.  As I approached I was able to tell that The lights were not moving at all.  I still did not think much of it, until I saw the lights quickly dim and then brighten again as the object darted a short distance to the right and came to a dead spot.  At this point, I was close enough to see a vague outline of the object against the slowly darkening sky.  Closer, now the object seemed to mimic the classic movie version of a UFO.  Strikingly saucer-like. So much so that I did a double take, a triple take and then looked over at the driver in the next lane who was pointing up with a bewildered look in his face also.  As I passed underneath it, I tried to get a closer look through my sun roof only to see a triangular shaped base that was almost reminiscent of military jets, but yet not quite like anything I've ever seen.  I have done some research and have not found any known military craft that match what I and the other driver saw.;38.0074924939471;-85.6922288135595
Shepherdsville, Ky  13 triangle crafts hovering right above the tree tops along the highway with no sound;2010-03-27 01:00:00;20 minutes;Shepherdsville, Ky  13 triangle crafts hovering right above the tree tops along the highway with no sound At about 1am my brother and I were traveling on Highway 265 southbound when just above the tree top we saw a triangle shaped aircraft.  Then we noticed more and more on the left and right side along the highway just above the tree tops with red and white lights. At each corner of the trianlge was a bright white light.  In the front of one these hovering objects was one bright headlight.  This is why we thought it was a helicoptor at first but with the moon over top of one we soon realized they are not helicopters.  These objects moved very slowly and hovered with no noise at all.  We saw 13 all together for about the next 8 miles.  After seeing a few of them I saw a sign off the northbound side of the highway that read something about aerospace/military development or something close to that.
