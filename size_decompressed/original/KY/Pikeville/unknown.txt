Huge rectangular light...Shape unknown.;2014-07-26 22:00:00;10 minutes;Huge rectangular light..Shape unknown I was observing stars when I noticed two red lights parallel to each other, I pointed it out to two friends and a huge light came on rectangular in shape. The outside shape of the object could not be made out due to the dark night sky. The light seemed to have something moveing inside of it to the left side of the light.  A huge red light came on just left of center inside of the cf the craft. I was amazed to say the least, so was my friends. The light stayed on for several minutes then just went out.  There was several red lights on the object that weren't extremely bright like an aircraft would have and had only red lights no other colors. The object moved off to the left, our viewpoint was going to be blocked by a mountain so we ran towards it to get a longer look at the object. It was at that time we thought we may have saw more than one but with our excitement and hearts pounding it was hard to tell if it was just my nerves or shakeing causeing me to think stars were moveing. At that time the object moved overhead of us and appeared low in altitude.  It had several red lights and two on the rear were blinking.  It made no sound and for an object to be so low I didn't understand what was propelling it?  This experience has rarely left my mind since it occurred, hardly a day goes by without me thinking of it at least once.;37.508921238938;-82.5208752212388
