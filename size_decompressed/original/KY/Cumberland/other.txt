On this night I was with my brother and we were fishing at lake cumberland.  It was a warm night and I was getting tired of fishing and just laid back on the dock and looked up at the sky at the stars.  You could see them all great that night and I remember I started to watch what I thought was the begining of a falling star.   It was moving across the sky very slowly and then it raced acrossed the sky and then it just stopped.  I knew then that this was no falling star.  It made it's way back in the direction it came from and would also quickly change directions.   At this time I was maybe 15 years old and back then I do not believe we had any kind of technolgy that existed then or now to do the things I saw this craft do.  I don't know what it was.  All I know is that all of a sudden it just vanished. I'm in the USAF now...I know what I saw and it has always been something that I can never fully explain because I was just in awe back then as I am now telling whomever this account.
