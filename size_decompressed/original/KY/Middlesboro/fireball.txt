I had went to take my woman to see her daughter after the fireworks were over.  My Woman's wheelchair bound, so it takes us awhile to get out of the truck.  Well, I was just looking around when something caught my eye in the sky toward the north moving slowly.   There was a power line above me and I used it to tell how fast.  It slowed down and stopped for a moment, it then turned around and shot away as if it went into a tube or something.  I told her to look and she did and seen it with me.  But it seemed to scare her and she denied seeing anything and won't talk about it!   It was softball sized and reddish orange and seemed to have an orange bump on the bottom and top.  IT WAS NOT ANY KIND OF FIREWORKS!  I wrote to you before about my first sighting. I did'nt dream I'd see another one!  I wasn't going to report it, but something told me to check anyway.  Now I'm glad I did!  This thing just made a U-turn and went from softball sized, to a dot, and then to nothing, within a half second!   From start to finish, it lasted about 5 minutes;36.6144;-83.7204
12/18/12 extremly slow moving fireball with fire trail that lasted 30sec then just very suddenly disappered.;2012-12-18 05:30:00;30 seconds;12/18/12 extremly slow moving fireball with fire trail that lasted 30sec then just very suddenly disappered. I went out to feed the dog on my early morning detail when I looked up there was this ever so slow orange fireball with a small firelike trail behind it.  No sound, and was nothing like those Chinese lanterns.  It flew as if it was real high, and then just like you would turn off a light switch. It just disappeared!   No slow fade of anykind.  Just diappeared.  I live way back in the mountains so I don't have to worry with a lot of street lights.   I see stars with ease!  This thing was strange as to how it disappeared, and how it flew so slow!   I've never seen anything like it before.;36.6144;-83.7204
