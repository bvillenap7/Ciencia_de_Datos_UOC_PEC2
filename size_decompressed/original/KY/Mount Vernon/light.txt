We watched it for close to an hour float higher in the sky and move like wind currents were carrying it.  Then it would dart back. No clouds at that time at first thought I was seeing things but my girlfriend also saw it.  Some of the eradic movements were not wind currents or natural.;37.3955;-84.3359999999999
