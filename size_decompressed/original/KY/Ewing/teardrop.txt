Tear-drop shaped lights.;2007-03-07 19:30:00;20 minutes;tear drop shaped lights In the direction of due North my husband and I noticed 3 tear dropped lights, with the point towards the east, this symbol is my best description of the shape(&gt.  The left side was red, the middle was orange and the tip yellow, the colors seems to pulsate from the red to the yellow (wave like).  The size, if you hold your thumb up straight out in front of you they were the size of the thumb nail.  There was no noise, they stayed stationary.  The first one seemed to fade &quotout&quot, then another one would &quotfade in&quot in the back of line.  They all at one time faded out, then another one would show up. There were 5 in the sky at one time, then they each started to fade out, one at a time and no new ones would show back up.  They never moved from there location.  They sat between a maple tree and the point of our neighbors barn.;38.4158;-83.8734
