UFO spotted in Richmond,Ky near The Bluegrass Army Depot..??Is this Aliens or Government cover up;2011-06-30 17:00:00;20 min;UFO spotted in Richmond,Ky near The Bluegrass Army Depot..??Is this Aliens or Government cover up It was around 5:15 on Thursday, june 30th, in Richmond, KY, when a buddy of mine and myself seen something that changed our lives forever.   While standing on our back deck having a cigarette, I noticed a a cigar shaped object descending from the sky.  We were convinced that it was an asteroid or something crazy like that, although there was no trail of smoke.  It disappeared past the horizon.  Around 10 min later I seen this object shoot back up into the sky using the same path it had descended from.  Once it reached a comfortable level in the sky it quickly changed its shape into a silver Ball and shot across the sky through a lightning storm.   To our suprise 30 min later there were even more objects in the sky that were unknown and making very quick movements dodging aircrafts and sneaking up behind them.   This to me is the real deal, something one has to see to believe. Also this is very near The Bluegrass Army Depot where a large supply of the nations nerve gas is s! tored.;37.7548000000002;-84.2985000000001
Two solid lights about 100 feet in the air over a field.;2011-12-30 23:00:00;30sec;Two solid lights about 100 feet in the air over a field. Less than a quarter mile off the road to my left and no more then 100 feet in the air I saw two lights, one red one white, 10 to 20 feet apart. They seemed to partially illuminate the object which appeared to be metallic. I rolled down my window and turned off the stereo to make sure I couldn't hear any helicopter blades. I was driving home from work by myself at around 23:00 but there were other cars on the road that may have seen it as well.;37.7548000000002;-84.2985000000001
