Both objects would from hovering would dart across the sky and stop for 10 to 20 sec. and take off to a different angle and stop again.  Both of the ufo's played in the sky for around 35 min..  The odd thing was that The ufo's would dissapear Around 3 min. before a commercial plane would enter the area.  The next day in Wendy's 2 airborne division men in dress came in to eat.  There is no air base near by. Around 1:05 am An obgect shoot across the sky and stopped in mid air.  Usually there is 4 to 5 guests that hang around but this time there were just my roommate and I.  A second object was spotted near by.  The ufo's from hovering would soot across the sky and stop in mid air. The objects looked like one of the clips from one of the earlier X FILES shows. Where the objects that were a little bigger than stars. would move in many directions and stop. The background was a clear night on the flat lands of Richmond KY . The ufo's would disappear minutes before a commercial airline would come through the area where they were at an appear later to put on a show again. Finally the ufo's darted off like a shooting star together to the west and would never appear that night. The next day we were at Wendys and 2 airborne division officers came in looking really tired from the night before. They didn't speak to each other hardly at all. They did look around the restruant at the people to! see who was observing them. There is no airborne  or base nearby in the area exept for the chemical storage base that has no landing strip that i no of (i've have been there).;37.7548000000002;-84.2985000000001

small mystery object over Wal-Mart;2002-06-29 14:00:00;at least 20 minutes;small mystery object over Wal-Mart On my way back into Richmond from the Blue Grass Army Depot, a friend and I saw a strange object floating across the Eastern By-pass, from the K-Mart side over to a position above Wal-Mart's parking lot.  At first we thought the object was a kite, because of its erratic path, but then it would often straighten up and move in a very deliberate direction, like a manned object.  I used my digital camera as a binoculars by looking through the zoom lens at maximum range, and after close inspection I clearly saw something moving on the side of the object facing me. To me, depending on the size perspective, it seemed to be either a small craft reminiscent of the old Apollo Lunar Landers, or it was something like an Autogyro, the old flying chair device that's been used in military recon missions for decades. If it was the latter, the movement I saw on it could have been the person operating it.  The object was seen by a great many people in the parking lot and by persons on the Eastern By-Pass. UFOs are very commonplace in the vicinity of the Blue Grass Army Depot and I wasn't surprised when the event did not make the local news.;37.7548000000002;-84.2985000000001
16 UFOs seen in under 4 hours!;2012-06-12 21:00:00;3 Hours 45Min.;16 UFOs seen in under 4 hours! My friend and I saw a metallic saucer around 9pm last night.  I had a pair of binoculars in my car so I quickly grabbed them.  We both observed it until it disappeared behind some clouds and we couldnt see it any longer. We went to his house and played video games and came outside to smoke a cigarette and we saw a glowing orange ball about 2 miles away from us.  We weren't very surprised to be honest.  We actually see this type of craft around his house all the time,  the only difference with this time is we saw 16 crafts.  They didn't all look alike though, and they were not all out at the same time.  One of the orange crafts appeared to eject a an object that had red flashing lights on it. I recognized this craft as one of the triangle type ufos that have three lights on the bottom of it.  It got close enough to us to where i could tell that it was not an airplane because there was no noise.  After that, one of the orange crafts got close enough for me to ! see the outline of the craft.  It was disk shaped, just like your standard UFO.  I was even able to make out what appeared to be an observation deck.  However i was not able to see any beings through it even with my binoculars.  There weren't more than three craft in the air at a time, so we could very well have seen the same craft more than once.  But we saw 16 ufos in all.;37.7548000000002;-84.2985000000001
