A yellowish twinkling light with a red ring around it that disappeared after about 3 minutes.;2001-11-21 04:45:00;3 minutes;A yellowish twinkling light with a red ring around it that disappeared after about 3 minutes. As I was walking to my car to get my cigarettes around 4:45 am, I noticed along the horizon a yellow light. This light has not been there before, because I work a morning shift and I always look in that direction in the morning when I smoke. It was a yellowish round light that was twinkling rapidly. It appeared to have a red ring around it. I compared it to the building lights around me and it was nothing like it, nor do we have buildings that tall here. I compared it to the other stars, and it was huge at least twice the size of them.  I stood very still and noticed that it was moving. I thought it was an airplane or a meteor that was about to hit the earth. And then, it lulled for a moment and appeared to have dissipated. But it went upward before it was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  We note that the report is not inconsistent with the landing light on an approaching aircraft, but we do not know if there are any major airports in the area of the sighting.  Please see other report from Ontario for this same date.  PD));37.7548000000002;-84.2985000000001
Long duration sighting, likely at least 10 miles distance, but undoubtedly strange behavior.;2003-09-26 21:00:00;~1 hour;Long duration sighting, likely at least 10 miles distance, but undoubtedly strange behavior. I was walking my dog West, on Ole Daniel Boone Road, toward I-75. I had been watching the sky quite a bit because Mars had been close to Earth and this is also the first I have lived back out away from city lights in about 10 years. There was what I thought was a star, cradled in a dip in the tree line. It looked large the way Mars had, so I was particulary interested, though Mars at this time of night was SouthEast. I thought it might be a larger planet or something, but when my dog stopped to go to relieve himself, I realized that it was moving. There were powerlines that also ran through the dip in the tree line that gave a point of reference and it was moving in relation to that, most noticeably. I figured that it would be gone shortly, so I stood a and watched it a while. I didn't think it's movement was anything a helicopter couldn't do, but I also knew, from a figure I'd just heard that it costs about $500/hr. to operate a helicopter and that helicopters are typically going somewhere. What point would there be to just bobbing and drifting side, after dark? I was basically white and oval and some times seemed to shade to having a blue-ish halo. The center never changed colors.  I kept expecting it to dart off as they supposedly do, but after a while, I decided I wanted to see if I could get some witnesses, so I could talk about it to somebody without them thinking I was making it up. So, we ran back to my fourplex where we have a second floor apartment, where my wife, sister-in-law and nephew were. I breathlessly  (I'm overweight) told them to come out on the balcony, hoping that it would still be there. It was a little harder to see, because there's a big orange security light behind the building, but it was still there. We stood back there and watched it and talked about it for a long time, and we all were kind of waiting for it to dart off, but it just bobbed and weaved. I actually knelt down and put my chin on the heels of my hands to make sure my head moving wasn't making it look like some fixed object was moving because the treeline was only about 100 yards away. I saw on FOX that a lot of people watching Area 51 thought they were seeing a UFO weave side to side, but that they were seeing an airliner, bringing people to work there, correcting itself, as it was approaching a runway. So we talked about that for a while and decided that if we were watching a plane from head-on that it would eventually make some progress, but it never seemed to. My nephew didn't really understand what it was and was starting to get bored and acting up a little bit, so we actually all just finally went inside and the clock showed it was 10:10, but my wife sets it up a few minutes so she won't be late for work, where there's a fast clock. When my sister-in-law left, about 30 minutes later, we looked again from the parking lot to see if it was still there and we didn't see it, but she later told us that as she was driving home she could see it, West of I-75, but South of where she lives in Lexington. If I had to guess, I believe the light was between Richmond and Nicholasville, KY. I would not have reported this, normally, but I have just read the story of what happened in Morehead, KY and the c! rop formation in Flemingsburg. Though this may not be a particularly interesting UFO story, it may be significant that there was a certain level of activity in Central and Eastern Kentucky, within a certain time frame. I am going to e-mail an animated gif I have created in photoshop to demonstrate, in a very simple way, how it behaved, though it didn't move quite this jerky and had no particular pattern of movement.

Flashing lights seen moving in the sky.;2008-06-12 01:30:00;About 2 hours;Flashing lights seen moving in the sky. My mom was walking our dog, and she told me to come look. Up in the sky, very far away, was this twinkling light. It wasn't like a star, though. It flashed red and blue on the sides, and actually moved around slowly in the sky. After we started watching it move, we noticed another flying stationary across the other side of the sky. This second light was closer and you could see the colors more clearly. They weren't planes, because they moved whenever they felt like it at whatever speed they wanted. We actually got in the car and chased after the stationary flashing light, but we couldn't get any closer. It was very high and very far. It moved as we chased it though, so as far as I know it could have had a constant slow movement and I just couldn't tell because of the distance. But they did for sure move. They just now got so far that we can't see them anymore, so I came in here and typed this. It was CrAzY.;37.7548000000002;-84.2985000000001
Green falling object from the sky over Richmond Ky 2010;2010-10-30 21:00:00;20 MIN;Green falling object from the sky over Richmond Ky 2010 A friend and I were standing on my back porch in Richmond Ky on a clear cold night in October.  The actual date I have now forgotten.  We live on the route of a nearby airport and I see and know what planes flying over looks like and we also live very close to an army depot which reported NO activities this particular evening. We were standing facing the open sky and I saw a glowing green flash hurdle to the ground descending from South to North...  It looked as though it hit the ground less than a visible mile from my house.  (Though we didn't witness ground impact).  The green glowing ball had a tail of sparks trailing behind it.  I have no idea the size of the object, but it was way bigger than a falling star and traveled slower than one time.  By the time I saw it, I had enough time to tell my friend to look too and we both witnessed it fall.   We stood outside long after, nervous of what might happen next and trying to explain what we saw.  Suddenly between 5 and 10 white lights appeared in the sky.  We at first thought them to be airplanes (comparably to the size an airplane light leaves in the sky)  However, these lights were doing figure 8's in the sky and would continuously travel towards and away from one another in a star like pattern.  This lasted for at least 20 minutes, and we had no video c! amera to record it. I called everyone I knew in the area, who also went outside and saw the event of the white lights.  About 15 people witnessed it during those 20 minutes.  I posted that I had seen a UFO of some kind in the area on facebook and got a response from two different people who were traveling a nearby highway who saw the green light also hurdle to the ground.  Both described the sighting exactly how I saw it without my going into detail first. No one ever mentioned the happening again.  I checked the newspaper the next day to see if anything had been said or reported or if their was an explanation and we couldn't find anything.

It was a constant light source and was not blinking, so it could not have been a plane.  It then slowed down and disappeared, which i assume it means that it left our atmosphere.;37.7548000000002;-84.2985000000001
Bright light.;2012-12-13 12:18:00;25 seconds;Bright light I'm an Over the Road truck driver I was heading southbound on I-75. I was traveling towards Tennessee, and I was on the phone with my uncle and I have recorded time of 12:18 pm EST when a light appeared coming towards me and I looked to see if it was a plane, but I knew it was not because it was cold outside and planes were leaving jet streams.  Then the light sort of Morfed Flat and speed away very quickly towards the south like if it Blinked at me.  My windshield was clean and the sky was clear.  I have never seen anything like this, the only thing I can say it did freeze me in my tracks!!;37.7548000000002;-84.2985000000001
