They were very scared, and wanted to call the police, and one even had an accident in his pants.  I  felt stupid to call the police, and they wanted me to report this.;37.7548000000002;-84.2985000000001

The object slowly traveled in the same elevation to West direction and stopped about 1 mile West from Road KY25 at about 500 feet elevation.  The object stayed at the same location for about 13 minutes, then took off with an unbelievable speed in 45 degree angle and disappeared.  The object had a dome shape and lights were on the bottom of it - about 8 lights spread in a symmetrical shape.   The object seemed to investigate something on the ground, then took off.  I wonder what is located around Richmond, KY, to capture their interest?;37.7548000000002;-84.2985000000001
