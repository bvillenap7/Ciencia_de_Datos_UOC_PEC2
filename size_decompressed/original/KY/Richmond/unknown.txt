two very bright bluish lights moving very slowly and oddly.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible star?  Or hoax.  PD));2008-10-23 19:00:00;1 hour;two very bright bluish lights moving very slowly and oddly I was riding my bike and came to the top of a hill.  I saw two very bright lights adjacent to each other that had a light bluish tint to them a few miles away to the south.  It didn’t make any sound at all that I could hear I watched them lower from the sky straight down at a very slow, steady rate until they went behind a hill.  I rode my bike down the road and down a backroad where I thought it might have landed.  I went a few miles until it rose back up at the same steady, slow pace about ½ of a mile away.  I could still not hear any noise.  It started moving steadily to the northwest, and so I turned around and chased it some more.  I followed it for a while, with little luck catching it.  It went over the hill and out of sight, in the direction of Lexington, Kentucky.  I tried to get a picture with my phone, but it showed up as only a light that is indistinguishable.  I have no clue what this object was or is, but it was unlike anything I have ever seen before. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

Encounter of the third kind.;2012-01-06 23:00:00;1 Minute;Encounter of the third kind.  500 Lights On Object0: Yes I was in my back yard smoking a cigarette when I heard a noise coming from the woods surrounding my backyard fence.  At first i thought it was a deer, but as I got closer to the fence I could tell that it was foot steps that i was hearing as the steps had a pattern of two and not four.  As I got right up to the fence I peered over and looked into the woods and saw the top of a head fairly large, pale white head on top of a 3 foot tall figure.  I called out Hello? and as soon as I did the being ran away into the woods at a very fast rate and disappeared.;37.7548000000002;-84.2985000000001
