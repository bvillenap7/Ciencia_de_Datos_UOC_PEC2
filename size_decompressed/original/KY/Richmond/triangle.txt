Triangular aircraft with huge round lights underneath traveled within 30 feet of my window as I watched it come across the river.;2011-09-27 04:30:00;2 minutes;Triangular aircraft with huge round lights underneath traveled within 30 feet of my window as I watched it come across the river. On September 27th, 2011 I was awoken by my dogs around 4:30 a.m.  As I stood up to go let them out I was distracted by lights out my window.  Because I live in the country, there are few lights outside.  These, however, were extremely bright and appeared to be spinning in a random pattern.  There were three lights that were all the same, but in different areas.  They were very close to the tree line, if not in it.  At that time, they were across the river from me. I watched to see if they could be part of something else, but one of them started to rise up in the air.  At first, I wasn't sure if I could believe my eyes, but it kept going up, then started to come towards my house across the river.  It moved in a 90 degree angle, straight up, then straight out and appeared to do so very smoothly, almost like being on a  conveyer belt.  I lost track of the other two lights when the one started moving. At this point, I grabbed my cell phone to try to video it, but was afraid that it was somehow aware of me, as it was coming straight toward my house.  Because I was nervous I held my phone at my stomach and tried to guess to where to find it to film it.  Unfortunately this was unsuccessful and not the smartest. However, I did, for about 1-2 full minutes watch the aircraft.  It came across the river and right over my garage which is directly outside my window.  My window was already up.  I had a fan running on a table below the window.  The fan is not loud, but the aircraft was so quiet that I turned off the fan to try to hear it, even as it was right in front of me.  I could barely hear it. What I saw was a huge triangular aircraft that was just cruising along.  I can't believe how big it was, how quiet it was, and how slow it was moving.  It had huge round lights underneath.  I could not see the top when it went by, and as it was coming toward me it was dark outside so I cannot say for sure, but it almost appeared to be just a solid triangular mass.  The bottom for sure, and the sides were clear to see.  I was probably no more than 30 feet from it.  I was stunned and didn't chase after it outside, but I wish I did. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness on two occasions, and she sounded to us to be quite sincere and sober-minded.  We suspect that she has reported the sighting quite accurately.  PD));37.7548000000002;-84.2985000000001
UFO Sighted Outside of Richmond KY.;2013-05-16 10:20:00;3 minutes;UFO Sighted Outside of Richmond KY. I was just driving home on the interstate after leaving work, when I noticed a bright light off to my right (between Lancaster road and Barnes Mill Road west of Interstate-75 above Wilgreen Lake).   As I focused in on the object I recognized that the figure was a triangle floating in the sky somewhat low to the ground.   The moonlight made it clear to me that it was triangular shaped.  The lights I first saw, were actually three lights one being on each corner of the craft.   After I recognized what I was witnessing my instinct was to get closer to it, when I increased my speed I watched it go from just hovering to leaving the atmosphere with incredible speed. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));37.7548000000002;-84.2985000000001

We saw a triangular craft with white lights in the sky traveling from Lexington, Kentucky home to Barbourville, Kentucky.;2014-04-19 20:47:00;5 minutes;We saw a triangular craft with white lights in the sky traveling from Lexington, Kentucky home to Barbourville, Kentucky. On Saturday my sister her husband and my niece and nephew and I where taking a short trip from Barbourville, Kentucky to Lexington, Kentucky to check out the malls.  On the way back home going through Richmond I saw a white light in the sky in front of the car that went from bright to dull to bright again.   Then as the highway made a turn I could see it out of the back passenger side window.  That was when I got a closer look at the thing.  It looked like it was closer to the car by then and I could clearly see a dark triangular craft with white lights on each of the three corners.   The thing was low enough that if it was an airplane it would make noise but I didn't hear a sound from it.   I watched it out the window for about ten seconds then all the sudden it disappears.  Absolutely no trace of the thing.   For about a minute I kept my eyes glued to the window trying to find it but nothing.  My sister's husband saw it too.  I am baffled, airplanes have blue and red blinking lights I know I love airplanes very much.   This was no airplane that I have ever seen in my life.   The first thing I thought to do after our sighting was to report it to you Mr. Davenport.;37.7548000000002;-84.2985000000001
