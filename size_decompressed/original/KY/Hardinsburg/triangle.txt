Triangle craft turned into a ball of light and back again, then took off.;2006-06-30 01:00:00;5-10 minutes;Triangle craft turned into a ball of light and back again, then took off. It was around 1 AM, and I had just gotten off of the phone with my (at the time) girlfriend.  I had decided to smoke one more cigarette before calling it a night when I noticed it just above the tree line, towards the north.  I didn't think anything of it at first, but then it just stopped and hovered there.  It looked like it was above my grandmother's neighbor's house, and had a solid red light in each corner, and a single blinking white light (picture a school bus light) in the center. Suddenly, it either turned into an orange ball of light, or emitted a light so bright that it appeared to me to be a ball of light, and began hovering back and forth, all the time making no noise whatsoever.  When it stopped moving back and forth, the light turned off, and it took off as quickly as it had stopped, with no perceivable acceleration. A moment later, a second craft, or possibly the same craft, flew to the exact same spot, and did the exact same thing as the first time I saw it.  I only had a cheap flip phone at the time, so I had no way to record any of this, as it was too dark, but my mother and grandmother both have seen a similar triangle shaped craft several years after that incident.  My grandmother believes it to be some sort of top secret military operation being conducted out of Fort Knox.;37.7494;-86.4522
