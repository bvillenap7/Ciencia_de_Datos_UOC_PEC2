Orange round light object flying near ekron, ky at a high rate of speed.;2015-03-28 23:15:00;3 minutes;orange round light object flying near ekron, ky at a high rate of speed. we were driving south on old ekron road approximately 2 miles from shumate road intersection. the back passenger rear of my ranger lit up bright orange we looked to see and there was a very bright round object in a descending path, approximatelu=y 300 feet in air, hard to tell how far away it was because it was so bright, i actually looked away and had night blindness, it was descending about 20 degrees below horizon until it went out of sight, it could have been over the ohio river, i am an engineer and i estimate it was traveling at least 2 times the speed of sound, however no sonic boom and it apparently did not hit the ground . we did not see any flames or hear an impact.  i have never seen a ufo or reported one before however i have seen shooting stars and meteors and comets, this was nothing like that.;37.9099;-86.159
