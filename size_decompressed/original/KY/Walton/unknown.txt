At first I thought it was a plane, but it was moving too fast for a plane.  I confirmed this 5 minutes later when I actually saw a plane, with contrails.   This particular object had no contrails, like most of the planes I see at that altitude.  Anyway, it caught a glint of the sun and I could tell it wasn't a bird.   It continued to move from SE to NW when it made an S move and then a figure 8.   I watched it until I couldn't see it anymore.  It LOOKED like a plane, but it was faster than a plane and did not move like a plane.;38.8875;-84.6327999999999
