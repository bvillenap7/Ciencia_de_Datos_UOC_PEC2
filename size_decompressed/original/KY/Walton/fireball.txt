Orange/red fireball;2012-07-06 23:00:00;3 minutes;orange/red fireball Looked like orange/red pulsating basketball moving in straight line North toward Florence and Cincinnati.  I followed to side of house and then it blinked twice and seemed to disappear upward w/o any king of trail.  Three seconds later it came back to same spot, blinked twice and then disappeared for good.  surprised to not see or hear any more reports in Northern KY.   My first sighting...was really strange as we are in the flight path for the Cinci airport and DEFINATELY was not an aircraft...no sound at all.
