For the last two weeks we have observed a flashing round to oval object moving from west to east. The movement is so slow and it just seem to sit there, but we will go inside and check on it in a couple of hours and it has moved and slowly it is in the eastern sky. It is flashing red, blue, white and green.   I have taken pictures tonite I hope to get something on flim.  We live in the south and if anyone else has seen this please post it or if you know what this is.  Thank you ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly Sirius.  PD));36.8648598484852;-83.89291540404
