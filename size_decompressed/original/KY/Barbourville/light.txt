During the fireworks display, I saw two lights.  One green, and one red.;2018-07-04 22:00:00;3 minutes;During the fireworks display, I saw two lights.  One green, and one red. While watching the fireworks tonight I saw what looked like two different colored lights circling the fireworks display.  The first one was a green one that was blinking for about a minute and then about a minute later a red one showed up and did the same thing.  Then they disappeared.  Or maybe it was only one object that changed color. It was like both lights were observing the fireworks.  I don’t know what they were.  I keep thinking that maybe they were someone’s drone or something.  Unidentified Flying Object right?  The second I realized what I might be seeing I took note of the time and committed everything I was seeing to memory so that I could record and report it here.  I sure hope that I find out someday.  Until then I’m gonna keep my eyes to the sky.;36.8648598484852;-83.89291540404
