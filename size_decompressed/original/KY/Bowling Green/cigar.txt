Shiny tic-tac type ufo spotted in bowling green ky;2019-09-03 19:15:00;5 minutes;Shiny tic/tac type ufo spotted in bowling green ky The object was shiny metallic in the shape of a vertical tic/tac or cigar.  The sun was setting and it traveled across the sky heading south/southwest.  At first I thought it might be a plane making a turn , which would account for its elongated shape, but after several minutes with neither a change of direction (if it were a jet in a banking turn) or a change in shape/orientation....thatâ€™s when I realized it had to be something else.  I immediately got online to find the location of the space station, it was located near Australia at the time.  I guess there is a chance it may have been a low orbit satellite reflecting the setting sun, no way to verify that.  My dog barked his head off the entire time it was visible.;36.9963920329673;-86.4479313186799
