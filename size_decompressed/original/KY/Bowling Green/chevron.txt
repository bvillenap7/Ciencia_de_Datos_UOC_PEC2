The warmth of the lights could be felt.;1993-07-09 19:23:00;5 minutes;The warmth of the lights could be felt. It had five lights, two on each side, and one on the front, like a delta shape.  Absolutely no sound at all, moving very slow, and the heat from the lights were warm on the bare arms.  It was approximately, just guessing a couple hundred feet overhead. Slowly moving overhead, the black form of the delta shape could be clearly seen.  Then maintaining the same slow movement, diappearing over the trees.

Went north about a mile and then made a hard left bank and came back. Then turned west and went over town and was gone I am a pilot so I know what I saw cannot be done. This craft went right over us. I looked at my son and he had the same look I did, our mouths were hanging open. Went north and made such a hard bank and moving so slow it would have stalled. But it came out of it's hard bank and came back toward us. Oh, did I mention this thing made no noise what so ever. Thats why I knew what it was doing could not be done. It had a marker light on each side and after it came back at us you could see two dimmer lights in the front. We just stood there watching it knowing it was not from here. It came back south and then turned west and went over town untill it dissapeared. We both just stood there like it froze us. Hope this is helpful .;36.9963920329673;-86.4479313186799
