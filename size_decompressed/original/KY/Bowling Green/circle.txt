A man (who sounded legit)called to report a u shape formation of 4 craft flying low & silently, tan in color A man called (who I told I would report this for, but he hasn't given me permission to give his name or #) & stated he saw 4 round craft in a u shaped formation flying low, fast, & silently. He said it lasted for about 10 seconds coming from the north to the south. I'm a field investigator trainee for Mufon.;36.9963920329673;-86.4479313186799
Two round gold reflecting discs stationary over kentucky;2009-06-28 20:30:00;4 seconds;Two round gold reflecting discs stationary over kentucky There were two objects stationary at about a thirty degree angle to each other apearing close to the half moon right at sunset.  I had the impression that the setting sun provided the gold color that made them visible to me.  I saw them clearly for a few seconds from the front of my house.  I moved quickly through the house and asked my wife to come and see them.  By the time that I went thriough the house they were gone.;36.9963920329673;-86.4479313186799
Spotted silent craft w/ pulsing circular lights (predominantly red with some yellow and orange tones) heading west at a low altitude.;2013-07-06 21:45:00;5 minutes;Spotted silent craft w/ pulsing circular lights (predominantly red with some yellow and orange tones) heading west at a low altitude. This evening my husband and I were taking a bike ride through our neighborhood when I spotted a red circular light in the eastern sky.  At first I assumed the light was part of the fireworks that had been taking place off and on throughout our ride, but just a minute or so later, we rounded a curve to find the light was directly in front of us just below a low cloud cover.  The strangeness of what we saw stopped us both in our tracks, literally. At first it appeared to be stationary and at an altitude of about 3000 – 5000 feet.  There was absolutely no sound coming from the object whatsoever throughout our observation.   As we continued to observe, the craft made its way toward us in a westward direction at what appeared to be a steady altitude.  The speed appeared to be about that of single engine plane.  As it passed directly overhead it was obvious that the object was illuminated unlike any airplane we’ve ever observed.  The lights appeared to be arranged in a circular pattern, were pulsating rather than blinking, and were predominantly red and either yellow or orange.   What we observed definitely was not typical of airplane running lights.  We were unable to make out a shape other than the circular appearance of the lights, and there was no unusual motion – just a steady westward track.   We were able to observe the object for about five minutes before it disappeared in the distance.  We estimate that the craft would have flown just south of the Bowling Green airport as it headed westward. In summary, what we saw was unusual enough that we both felt it important to report our observations.   The complete lack of sound at such a low altitude and the color and circular arrangement of the lights were unlike anything either of us had ever seen before.;36.9963920329673;-86.4479313186799
Circular object with red and orange lights hovering above scottsville rd area for an hour.;2013-11-28 18:00:00;45 minutes;Circular object with red and orange lights hovering above scottsville rd area for an hour. My husband went outside and noticed a large circular bright light in the sky.  It looked as if it could be the top of a cell phone tower except there is not ome there. after watching for 10 minutes we began to see red and orange blinking lights.  It just hovered in the same spot and we saw an airplane pass by it but it made it very obvious that the light was not a regular airplane because it was much larger and the lights were more rotating around the object versus the airplanes lights which blinked fastly and stayed in one spot.  After about 40 minutes it SLOWLY began to travel south, still flying very low.  We then witnessed another plane flying in the sky above it so we dont think it was a satellite since that plane (clearly a regular plane) was flying above it.  At about 45 minutes in the objects lighta started to flicker out and then get bright again.  Each dimming episode lasted about 20 secs, every 90 secs.  We watched it for an hour before it traveled out of our line of sight.;36.9963920329673;-86.4479313186799
