SOMETHING AIRBORNE HIT & DAMAGED OUR U-HAUL;1984-06-01 13:00:00;20 - Minutes;SOMETHING AIRBORNE HIT & DAMAGED OUR U-HAUL My story is a very strange one, and I have not told many people about this.  We decided to keep quiet about this incident back then because of being fired, or people thinking that we were responsible in some way - as will be explained.  They may have thought that we were seeing things or drinking, but we were doing neither.   As far as seeing a UFO or such, we didn't.  Yet, my co-worker and I did encounter something very strange and unexplainable indeed.  This is a TRUE story, and my previous co-worker can verify my story if he ever decided to come forward.  I still to this day cannot understand what happened to us that day back in 1984 etc.   The day began as I was working for Wal-Mart in Bowling Green, Kentucky.  The day was clear, warm, and beautiful.  It was a busy time of the year, and we were using U-Haul rental trucks to transport merchandise from our warehouse to our main store.   One day my co-worker and I were again sent out to get some more merchandise from our warehouse sometime after noon.  The warehouse was located across town from where our main store was located - about seven miles.  I was driving a large U-Haul truck, and was driving carefully.   Everything was going well until we came to the four-way intersection on the Nashville Road from Campbell Lane.  I stopped at the intersection red light, and then proceeded to turn right onto the Nashville Road.  We pulled up a bit and proceeded to drive the short distance left to our destination when something really powerful and large hit our U-Haul.  Whatever it was hit us so hard it literally made us jerk sideways, and it made a loud metal crashing noise.   After gathering our senses I put on the flashing emergency red lights and we got out to see what had happened.  We both thought that somebody had hit us in the back end of our truck.  Yet, when we looked around there was not any vehicle anywhere that had hit us - nothing.   We would have seen a vehicle pass us while we were inside the truck, but this was not the case either.  Nobody else (traffic) seemed to have seen anyone hit us, or anything unusual, either.   Now confused and puzzled, we decided to look for damage to the U-Haul, and this is where the real strangeness comes to play.  When we went to the right passenger side of the truck there was some severe damage to the truck, but it was near the very TOP side of the vehicle.  My co-worker and I were completely stunned and speechless.   A severe dent about eight feet long and two feet deep was plainly visable on the truck near the top.  This was the passenger side that no traffic at all could have been near to because there was no road there - just a school yard.  Whatever had hit the upper part of the U-Haul had to have been airborne!   The damage to the truck was extensive, highly visable, and not there when we had began our trip that afternoon.  The truck was checked before we had left the store.  Whatever hit the truck had to have been airborne, and very big and slanted to make a deep dent like that.  The damaged looked like what a disk would make if it hit metal.   We didn't know what to do, and feared that we would be held liable for the damage.  We feared for our jobs too.  After all, who would possibly believe such a story as this?  How could we logically explain this?   After a while of talking we both decided to keep quiet about this because we felt we had to.  Nothing was ever mentioned to us about the damaged U-Haul either when we got back to our store, and we felt that was odd, too.   I can tell you absolutely that somthing very large, airborne, and powerful struck our U-Haul truck that day.   Whatever it was had to have been flying at tree-top level and grazed our truck.  Yet, we never saw the craft or whatever it was.   This story is absolutely true and accurate.  I have no idea of how to give you any kind of sensible explaination for this.  We were attacked or hit by something strange though.  Strange stuff!   Thank you for your website and interest.

Obviously something low in the atmosphere that caught my attention.  Then just vanished in a clear night sky.  Appeared as two pinkish lights horizontally aligned maybe 3-4 miles away.  Just as I was pointing it out to someone it extinguished it's lights.  No sound. ((NUFORC Note:  We presume the sighting occurred in the year 2003, and we have amended the date above.
