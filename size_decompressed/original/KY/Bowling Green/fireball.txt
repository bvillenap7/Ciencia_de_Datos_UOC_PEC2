Fireball Light Seen;2001-02-01 20:00:00;5-10 minutes;Fireball Light Seen I read your report about a fireball being seen in and near Bowling Green, Kentucky.  Well, I too have seen this object many times traveling on the Nashville Road going to or from Franklin, Kentucky.  This object(s) does not appear every night-just at various times.  I cannot explain what we (my friends and I, and others) are seeing, but it IS real.  Most of the time the object(s) seem to be to my left as I am driving toward Franklin, Kentucky.  The object glows really bright with a red light sometimes appearing at the bottom or center of it.  Then, all of a sudden the light will go out.  At times the light wil zig-zag for a time.   One night as I was going home from Church, I looked up and there it was, glowing like fire on a very dark night.  The object then began to move at a very slow pace and was getting nearer to my automobile.  I was a little concerned to say the least.  Then I looked underneath this object and saw 2 more smaller lights flying faster underneath it.  They were very visable.   As I approached Bowling Green, the fireball light was still there.  As I got closer to the light the object seemed to take on a triangular appearance.  I cannot be sure because the trees were obscuring my view, but it appeared that something was there.   I must mention that one time previously at my friend's house we saw the object, and we took out his binoculars to take a look at it.  The object looked rectangular or diamond shaped, and had a purple glow to it.  There could be a reasonable explaination for this-but I don't know what it could be.   As I said before, on various nights this glowing fireball can be seen clearly, and it seems to big to be a glowing star.  ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Source is anonymous.

Observed slow and low flying single orangey, reddish ball of light in sky.;2013-06-03 17:30:00;5 minutes;Observed slow and low flying single orangey, reddish ball of light in sky. Observed a large ball of light. Orange to red in color, very similar to St. Elmo's fire. Ball of light rose up over the tree tops, seemingly from the river, and slowly began traveling towards my place of buisness.  It was flying lower than a helicopter and a lot slower. There was no sound and no outline or silhouette of an aircaft.  It traveled over my head and out my view.  Three times this month I have observed this same light, or ones exactly alike. Each time I observed these lights it is always the same, and coming and going in the same direction.  One witness observed three lights together on a seperate night, flying in a triangular formation. I have never seen this before, anywhere, in my whole life.;36.9963920329673;-86.4479313186799
