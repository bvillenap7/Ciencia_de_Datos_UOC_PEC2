Odd ship seen, with 3 lights formed into a triangle shape.;2011-12-15 19:30:00;5 mins.;Odd ship seen, with 3 lights formed into a triangle shape. 3 Lights that made to triangle shape together, where seen in the distance moving to slowly for a plane. I was in a riding in a car, traveling down 231/Scottsville Rd.   As the object got closer I could tell that it was not very high off the ground, maybe 500ft. Also I could make out the shape of the craft, it was a cigar/triangle shape with windows on the top.  IT WAS NOT A HELICOPTER! I know a lot about helicopters and non look like this. A day later my friend told me his dad had seen some strange lights in Bowling Green with similar description.;36.9963920329673;-86.4479313186799
8-9 Flame colored lights flying in a low formation over Bowling Green, KY.;2013-09-14 20:40:00;~2 minutes;8-9 Flame colored lights flying in a low formation over Bowling Green, KY. 8 (possibly 9) bright flame colored lights - appearing like glowing embers - moving across the sky from east to west.  At first I assumed them to be helicopters flying in formation, possibly towards one of the closest military bases like Ft. Campbell.  They were moving very fast, and appeared to be somewhat low in the sky.  They were completely silent. As they passed over head and moved on to the west they faded away.  The lights quickly dimmed and vanished.  Never seen anything like it.  Can't say with certainty that they were NOT military aircraft, but the color and intensity of the lights were like nothing I've seen before.  They looked like they were on fire.  Helicopters flying that low are typically audible.  These were totally silent.  Maybe I was seeing pieces of some orbital junk burning up, but they were flying low and straight, very fast, and appeared to be in formation.;36.9963920329673;-86.4479313186799
Two star-like objects moved in the same path slowly, then suddenly sped up ALOT with random jittery motions, then faded out of view.;2014-03-20 22:00:00;15 seconds;Two star-like objects moved in the same path slowly, then suddenly sped up ALOT with random jittery motions, then faded out of view. Looked up and saw what initially looked like two stars, but they were moving perfectly side by side together, slowly.   Suddenly they both sped up extremely quickly, moving in their own irregular paths (very random jittery motions) until they seemed to fly away, fading out from my view into the night sky.;36.9963920329673;-86.4479313186799
