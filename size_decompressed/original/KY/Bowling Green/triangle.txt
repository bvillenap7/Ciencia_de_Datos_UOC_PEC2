I was traveling home from the Rich Pond area toward the city of Bowling Green, Kentucky.  After I had left the Nashville Road, and began to drive on the Cave Mill Road, I noticed a very large bright red pulsating glowing light to my left out of the front windshield of my automobile.  Realizing that Bowling Green has a small airport, I at first thought it was an aircraft of some sort.  But then I began to notice that the object was not moving at all, and it was hovering silently in the same position.  There was no sound at all from the craft that I could hear.  I was now close to the Church of Later Day Saints on the Cave Mill Road, and the object was still hovering silently in the same spot.  Then all of a sudden the bright red pulsating glowing light somehow became smaller, and I could see that the object was triangular in appearance.  The object had a red pulsating light glowing underneath it, and also two smaller white lights on the back tip ends of the triangle.  I immediately pulled into the Church of Later Day Saints parking lot to observe the craft some more.  After watching it hover for close to five more minutes, the craft then began to slowly move away to the southwest.  The object was still so bright that I could see it moving away slowly for several miles before it finally disappeared.  This was indeed a very strange incident, and it DID happen. I have no explanation for it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  Date is approximate.  Discrepency in the times reported by the witness.

LARGE TRIANGLE FLYING EXTREMELY LOW WITH SOUND;2004-07-16 10:00:00;1-Minute;LARGE TRIANGLE FLYING EXTREMELY LOW WITH SOUND This is a true report that I am submitting to you.  I know what my friends and I saw.   Back in the summer of 2004 I was attending a Wednesday night Church service in the Richpond area of Bowling Green, Kentucky.  The area is located just off the Nashville Road.   My friends and I were outside in the Church parking lot preparing to leave.  We were all just chatting away as friends do after our Church service.   All of a sudden we began to hear a very loud roar approaching our location from up in the sky-extremely low.  We looked around and could not see any lights or aircraft at all.   The roaring sound became louder, yet we could still see no object whatsoever.   All of a sudden I looked directly overhead of us and saw a very large black triangular object flying extremely low.  My friends saw the object too.   At first we thought it was probably a B-2 Stealth Bomber, but why would it be flying so low?  The object was flying only around 200 feet above us.  Also, why did the object have no lights flashing as all aircraft normally do-especially flying so low?   We could only see the outline of the triangle, and it was really large.  It was no blimp either.  We all observed the mysterious large object until it just simply disappeared into the night sky.   Looking back, I do not think that this was an aircraft we saw that night.  The whole episode was really strange.  Whatever this thing was defies logical explaination.   Some people might think that we are crazy, but this event really happened.   Thank you for reading my message. ((initials deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

I watched for a few minutes and it moved a bit left/right and forward almost. Super tired I got back in bed and told my husband he should go look. I drifted off but when he got back in bed he said that was the coolest thing and it was so close. In the morning I asked what he saw to compare and he said an orange triangle. He described it much closer than when I had looked at it.;36.9963920329673;-86.4479313186799
