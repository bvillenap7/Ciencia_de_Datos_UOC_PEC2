Santa Claus?...really not intentional hoax, Santa sled is only way i can explain it.;2013-12-19 17:55:00;1 minute;Santa Claus?...really not intentional hoax, Santa sled is only way i can explain it. Single white light in front.  Sometimes dimmed, did not flash.  Main craft was behind/trailing the light.  From that I would think some kind of plane with light far put front.  However three was another craft,or something large.  Approximately 4 or 5 times as large as main rectangular craft.  The larger object was ovoid/bean shaped and grey with a darker band through middle.  This object appeared tomove quickly from side to side and above/ below/behind the man craft.  It seemed to pause before moving to other side.  My son thought the large object may have been a parachute, but the craft never slowed as it went out of sight.   I am not expert, but I have flight experience.  Would guess was flying 100 mph (plus /minus 25) @ 3000 feet directly over airport.  Heading due north. I am a rational well educated man, and firmly skeptical of about everything unless I see for myself.  This is still a u.f.o. to me, but my best explanation would be Rudolph was the light, rectangle=sled, other object was bag of toys.  I cannot fathom any other explanation from what I saw.;36.9963920329673;-86.4479313186799
