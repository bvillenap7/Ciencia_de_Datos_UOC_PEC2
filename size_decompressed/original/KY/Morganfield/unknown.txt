vertically blinking lights , some reddish in color and some bluish white in color moving at a steady SW direction.;2005-11-03 18:45:00;5 minutes;vertically blinking lights , some reddish in color and some bluish white in color moving at a steady SW direction. My husband is a police officer and he called me to say that one of our neighbors had reported strange lights in the sky and if I wanted to, I could get my binoculars and see if I could see what the neighbor was talking about.  I went out in my backyard and looked up and around the sky when I saw blinking lights SW of my house.  I focused my binoculars on the lights and I saw three vertical reddish blinking lights.   I watched for a few seconds and the red lights went out and then I saw, below the site where I saw the red lights, six more vertical blinking bluish white lights. These lights were spaced far apart with three lights on each side.  I watched for a few seconds and then the bluish lights went out and the red ones came back on.  Before I lost my view of the lights, they were alternating their blinking at closer intervals.   The lights were moving in a steady westerly direction the entire time.;37.6873999999999;-87.9483
