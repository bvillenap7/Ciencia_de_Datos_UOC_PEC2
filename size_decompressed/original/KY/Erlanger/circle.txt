Tonight at 11:10 pm. we were jumping on the trampoline.    ((NUFORC Note:  ISS and Space Shuttle??  PD));2009-07-24 23:10:00;4 minutes;We are 3- 14 year old boys in Erlanger, KY.  Tonight at 11:10 pm. we were jumping on the trampoline.  We looked up and saw 2 circular lights.  We thought they were shooting stars, but there were 2 right next to each other.  One was bright and the other dim.  They were flying right next to each other over top of us.  A few seconds later, the dimmer light just disappeared.   The bright light continued to fly at a consistent pace.  There were no flashing lights, like on a plane and the light was very big and bright. Then one of us made a comment â€œWhat if the light just disappeared?  And then it literally just faded out. Has anyone else reported this sighting tonight in this area?;39.0055000000001;-84.6005999999999
