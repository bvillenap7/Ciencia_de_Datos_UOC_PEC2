Four lights in the sky helicopter seen in close proximity;2009-11-07 19:52:00;5 minutes;Four lights in the sky helicopter seen in close proximity On 11/7/09, two observers witnessed a UFO from Erlanger, KY which looked to be north of the location, towards Cincinnati, OH.  The object consisted of four lights in the sky, formed by two lights in a line, and two more on opposing sides below the second light much like a dotted star without two of the points.  The lights were stagnant in the sky, and on two occasions in the approximate five minute period, one of the lights went out, then proceeded to turn back on.  What appeared to be an aircraft of some type was following the lights, this craft came closer towards us, then went the opposite direction.  As it was nighttime, this object could not be identified, but was assumed to be a helicopter.  The 'helicopter' disappeared right after the lights went out.;39.0055000000001;-84.6005999999999
