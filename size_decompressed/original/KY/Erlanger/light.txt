Small blue light observed over the Erlanger/Florence area.  ((anonymous report));2016-07-08 01:25:00;2 minutes;Small blue light observed over the Erlanger/Florence area. I was outside smoking a cigarette and, as I often do at night, staring at the stars.  I observed a small light blue solid light begin to move across the sky towards the southwest.  The shape appeared to be circular, but was far too high to be certain.  At first glance I thought it was a star. The light traveled in a fairly straight line for the most part. It took one slightly sharp quick turn upward before returning back to its original course.  At this point I called my girlfriend outside to make sure I wasn't crazy. After about 30 seconds of it moving in open sky it came close enough to a star for her to be able to see its movement as well. I was able to observe it for roughly 2 minutes, before it moved into the light pollution, at which I lost it.
