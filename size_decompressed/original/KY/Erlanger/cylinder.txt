Cylindrical object in the sky over Northern Kentucky;2013-01-02 04:45:00;2-3 minutes;Cylindrical object in the sky over Northern Kentucky I was outside on my balcony having a smoke before bed.  I live near the CVG airport, and l know what all the planes look like as I used to work for the airline as a flight attendant.  The object I saw was definitely not an airplane.  It was cylindrical, and eminating light.   I stood and watched as it seemed to get closer.  When it did i could then see weird bright lights eminating from it, and at the bottom of the object I saw three bright red pulsating lights.   It was at this point right over my neighborhood.  It continued to ascend to the sky, and after a moment it was gone, through thick clouds we've got this morning.;39.0055000000001;-84.6005999999999
