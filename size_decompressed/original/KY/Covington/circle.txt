While driving, I and my passenger both saw 5-6 pulsing lights in a circular shape slowly moving across the sky low to the ground, then disappearing behind a tree line on a hillside (not actually disappearing, but we were in a car and could not see them any more). The lights were moving in unison and were spaced enough that whatever they surrounded was huge given how low to the ground the object looked, as it was moving/hovering just above the trees on a tall hillside, not far up in the sky.  There was no center light, but there was a dark, cloud-like misting that could be seen when the lights were bright.  We only saw them for a few seconds, and could not find them again.;39.0650857594936;-84.5199037974683
2 spheres about a foot apart colliding together and back apart.;2020-04-29 06:00:00;1 minute;2 spheres about a foot apart colliding together and back apart. There were 2 flying spheres flying above my apartment building.  The objects were closer than a plane would be.  The 2 spheres flew about a foot apart and would collide together and back out.  As it flew over the lights flickered.  I watched it until It flew too far into the distance.  Soon after a plane flew by and it looked nothing like the object seen.;39.0650857594936;-84.5199037974683
