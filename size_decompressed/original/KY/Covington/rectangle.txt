((anonymous report));2018-07-07 00:00:00;8 minutes;We were outside on our deck when 2, large, bright orange objects appeared coming from the north heading west.  They had a flame like appearance.  Moved slowly, horizontally and then up vertically.  Very bright.  Not a plane, balloon, fireworks, a comet or drone.   I have never seen anything like this.  Very bright orange color with a flame like body.  They appeared to be 'segmented' objects.  A cigar shape only flying vertically.  Moving like nothing that I have ever seen.  The 2 fly off and disappear.  Then a 3rd appeared, dimmly.  It seemed to be cloaked or less pronounced. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
