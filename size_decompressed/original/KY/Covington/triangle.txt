At 2:09 am i walked outside for a smoke break and i seen one slow moving air craft. it was in the shape of a triangle with that the craft also emitted very strange colors once out of sight i seen a second craft of the same description.  Although the second one was moving a bit quicker, it quickly released another craft of the same kind as it was moving.this really stunned me as the second two crafts moved out of my sight another craft quickly appeared and then two more crafts followed the one. but the best description that i seen was on the last craft as it was much closer in range.  I was able to identify that it was a triangular shaped craft with one huge light in each corner of the triangle it emitted a light formation around the craft as it was moving.  This shocked event shocked me very much;39.0650857594936;-84.5199037974683
