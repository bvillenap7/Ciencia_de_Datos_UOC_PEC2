Cigar shaped  silvery object  follows car's movement and speed then disappears into sky with incredible speed;1973-04-15 15:00:00;about 30 sec.;Cigar shaped  silvery object  follows car's movement and speed then disappears into sky with incredible speed I was driving my car going around a curve in a low lying area.  To my right a silvery ,cigar shaped object floated a few feet above the ground matching my speed and following the curve of the road.  Suddenly, the object began to move away and up into the sky at about a 40 degree angle at an incredibly fast speed.  It disappeared in a second, maybe two.  I was aware that there was no sound at all. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD));36.7313999999999;-88.6501000000003
