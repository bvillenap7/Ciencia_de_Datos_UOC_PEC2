family followed by darting, triangular objects.;1995-11-20 19:00:00;10 min.;family followed by darting, triangular objects. On the way into town, three objects spotted.  Each had three lights, arranged in the shape of a triangle.  Craft intermingled and moved in ways that I've never seen aircraft move.  They seemed to follow us into downtown, then we lost track of them. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));36.7313999999999;-88.6501000000003
