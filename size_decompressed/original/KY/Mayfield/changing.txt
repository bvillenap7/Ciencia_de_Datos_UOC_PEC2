Changing shape, crescrent to orb and orangish color.;2013-08-30 03:00:00;1 and a half minutes;changing shape, crescrent to orb and orangish color. UFO sighting – Mayfield, Kentucky 42066 August 30, 2013 approx. 3 a.m. A friend and I decide to go out on the porch to have a cigarette before we are off to bed.   As soon as we step outside and look to our left there is what appears to be a very small crescent moon that is an orangesque very light red.   We watched it for around 20 seconds before determining that we had no clue what it was and were very sure it couldn’t be the moon.  Before composing this report I stepped outside and used my iphone to determine that this ufo was approx. NE 60 degrees.   I took out my iphone and accidentally took a picture at first but meant to record a video but I was a little frantic. I took one photo and one video that is around 1 minute long.  The object we saw looked as if it was changing shape from crescent to almost a ball.  After watching it for probably 1 minute it looked as if it was going further away and getting harder to see which was actually fairly rapid compared to the time it takes a plane to move out of eye range.  My friend that witnessed this with ! me refuses to wright a report.;36.7313999999999;-88.6501000000003
