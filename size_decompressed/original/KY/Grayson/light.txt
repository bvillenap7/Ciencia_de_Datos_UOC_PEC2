Two small objects flying side by side and disappearing in an odd way.;2005-08-03 23:00:00;5 minutes;Two small objects flying side by side and disappearing in an odd way. Myself and 5 friends were night swimming at the lake.  It was an equal male to female ratio so it was kind of romantic.  In that sense we were all looking for shooting stars when one of us noticed two green lights moving toward us slowly.  We watched for a minute of so until one light, in an eerie arcing motion flew away and disappeared.   We watched the remaining light for 3 or 4 more minutes until, in the same fashion as the first it vanished.  In the midst of the happenings we discussed the possibilty of military testing as one friend was familiar with, and also hunting tactics of predators were one catches the attention while the othe sneeks up from behind.  This made us a little more weary of the situation and we left the area. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous, and provides just an e-address.  PD));38.3326;-82.9489

No flashing lights so I know it wasn’t a plane, and it was completely silent! Please tell me I’m not the only one seeing this!;38.3326;-82.9489
