At least 5 or 6 bright orange orbs moving South to North noted by 3 people.;2013-06-15 22:00:00;2 minutes;At least 5 or 6 bright orange orbs moving South to North noted by 3 people. I am an optometrist.  There were three bright orange orbs moving very slowly South to North. I first noticed them in front of a 3/4 moon.  Some trees were between me and the orbs.  I moved to an opening to view more fully and the third orb had disappeared. The first orb moved on North behind other trees.  The second orange orb suddenly changed direction and color to white star like light and shot up out of sight at unbelievable speed.  My cellphone pictures show the first two orbs however, poor quality.  My daughter, a dentist, and son, a computer programmer noted the first three orbs and a cluster of orbs behind them. I was on the North side of the house and they were in the pool on the South side.  So there were at least 5 or 6 orbs noted.;38.3326;-82.9489
