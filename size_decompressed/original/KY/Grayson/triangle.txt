Three non-blinking lights in sky, moving in unison with no noise.;2005-06-16 23:00:00;90 seconds;Three non-blinking lights in sky, moving in unison with no noise. At 11 p.m. on Thursday, June 16, 2005, I was outside looking at the sky in north-east Kentucky (Carter County.) The sky was clear, with stars throughout the sky easily visible.  At approximately the eleven o'clock position in the south, south-east sky, I saw what I thought was a triangle of stars, presumably part of a constellation, when I realized they were moving in unison towards the south, south-east. The three lights were shining steadily and unblinking. Their estimated brightness was between 3rd and 4th magnitude stars(probably closer to 4th magnitude.)  The object or objects made no noise that I could hear.  The lights were rather slow moving as compared to aircraft I have seen in the night sky.  The triangle shape was that of an isosceles triangle. One light in front, the other two at the rear.  I would estimate the distance between the two rear lights as approximately the width of the full moon disc. The distance from the rear lights to the front light was approximately twice the distance as that between the rear lights.  After about 60 to 90 seconds, the lights faded from view(Due to haze in the sky perhaps, as the front light disappeared first the following two almost immediately thereafter.)  My spouse also witnessed the lights.;38.3326;-82.9489
