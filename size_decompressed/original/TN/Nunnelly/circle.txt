The difference was that this aircraft stayed in one place, bouncing up and down. I began to think that maybe it was going to crash to ground because of the way it was bouncing up and down in same place. In witnessing the object, another aircraft passed by very close to the first object. That aircraft passed in a steady straight line towards Nashville International Airport. I continued to watch the first object bounce up and down. After 10 minutes, the object slowly disappeared into the clouds.;35.88;-87.5046
