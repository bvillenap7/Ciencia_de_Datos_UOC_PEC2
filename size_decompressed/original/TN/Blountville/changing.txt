It looked like a taradactal. The sky was blue with few clouds. Visibility was good. The object I saw was about a mile away and looked as if it was getting closer. It was triangle shaped at first, and it appeared to be changing shapes. It looked dark in color. It seemed to be flying back and forth on the downward spiral. Then it swooped back up into the clouds and was gone.;36.5373000000009;-82.3701000000001
