Estimated distance from witnesses 1-2 miles. At about  0630 Friday morning 24 Oct 1997 ((Two names deleted)) observed a circular object seeming to spin with lights in excess of 20 rpm. The first impression was that of a streetlight atop a nearby hill. After about  1 1/2 minutes stationary, the object suddenly darted off at a slightly ascending angle emitting a  noise similar to a jet aircraft. Observed flight-in-motion time approximately 4-5 seconds before disappearing behind a stand of trees. The color of the lights was very bright pale yellow.;36.5373000000009;-82.3701000000001
