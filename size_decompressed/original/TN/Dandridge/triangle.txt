Reappeared in front of me while driving, I pulled over and so did three other cars, to watch this triangular shape of lights which after a few minutes split it two separate crafts and shot away. I was leaving from ((address deleted)), on the New Market, Dandridge line to go towards 263 West Price Road.  My route was going east on Hwy 25/70. I glanced down at my clock and it said exactly 10:30pm (est) when an older model four door car passed me on the left.  Right after he passed me, my attention was drawn to a bright planet in the upper right hand side of my vision.  I also noticed a larger orangish light about three inches to the lower left of the planet.  I wasn't sure if it was moving at first, but as I slowed down to get a better look, it sped up. It was moving to the left at the same speed as an airplane would.  I pulled over to make sure it was blinking like an airplane, but it wasn't. Before pulling over, I passed three separate parked cars, that had pulled over,  each about 1/10 of a mile apart.  Out of each of the cars there were some witnesses looking and pointing towards the object. I pulled over into a gravel lot and rolled down my window.  As I began watching it again, two lights broke away, in opposite directions.  One was red, the other was blue. The object was about the size of a dime, then shot off in opposite directions. I then continued my journey towards Dandridge.  I wasn't the only one that saw it.;36.0008;-83.4233
