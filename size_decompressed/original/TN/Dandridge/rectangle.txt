Mytself and friend was driving north on I-81 between mile markers 1-20 and noticed surrounding area was lit up by a blue like light. slowing down we saw what was lighting up area.  It was between 500-700 feet long and 50-60 feet high. When we saw the back it was 50-60 feet wide. It's speed was 10-20 miles per hour.  My friend stopped the car as it went over. Suddenly the round objects on the rear glowed orange and it shot away out of sight. The top half was surrounded with windows allowing us to see inside.  It was well lit inside but our view made it appear empty. This craft looked as if there was no aerodynamics involved and in no way could possibly fly.  This was just one of several sightings by myself but was only one when I had someone with me.  I experienced communication with 5 aliens in 1993 or 94 when comet hailbob came thru.  This experience was very unique but far to lenghthy to report here now.;36.0008;-83.4233
