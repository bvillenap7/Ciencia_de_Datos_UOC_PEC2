Blimp shaped, shiny silver object during TN Earthquake.;2012-11-10 12:08:00;30 seconds;Blimp shaped, shiny silver object during TN Earthquake. During an earthquake, I witnessed a UFO shaped like a blimp, very shiny silver in color, no wings, no vapor trail and no sound.  Moving slowly in a straight line directly above my house.  No cloud coverage.  I could not see any windows but it was extremely shiny and bright so there could have been.  The UFO was not as low as a helicopter but much lower than a commercial aircraft.  No other aircrafts were in the sky at the time.  Once the earthquake was over the object could not be seen.;36.0008;-83.4233
