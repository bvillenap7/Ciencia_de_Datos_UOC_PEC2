I usually notice it in the same area in between my mom and grandma's house on the tn River (cedar bluff area) and it literally follows me back home 15 miles away.  It is super fast and when a flash is used to get a picture it appears to get closer to my vehicle.  My door locks start clicking and my radio even while off has some interference sounds like someone walking with a phone on in their pocket.  I have numerous videos and photos.  It's not a drone I don't believe because the bright lights and ability to keep up at 60-70 mph speeds!?  This has been going on for almost 2 yrs.  Many witnesses;35.5549;-88.1353
