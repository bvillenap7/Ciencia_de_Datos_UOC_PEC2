I noticed a low flying dark colored object flying low to the north flying from west to east. I initially thought that it was a b-52 bomber due to the length & the height of the fuselage being shorter or another type of large military transport aircraft.  I turned left onto lake rd. & looked in my rear view mirror & noticed this object going straight down like a helicopter, not a plane, & appeared as if it was landing or going over the horizon.  The object was initially traveling at the speed of an airplane & then began landing flat at no angle. The object appeared to have been within (1) or (2) miles or so away.  It was 1:49pm in the afternoon, sunny skies & I don’t recall any clouds in the sky.  It was not a blimp nor a helicopter.  The closest description I can give its maneuver is a b-52 with the landing capabilities of a harrier jump-jet. I called the dyersburg police department & dyer county sheriff’s department on the next day to see if there had been any other reported sightings of this object, but I was told there had not been.  I also learned that the dyersburg airport is to the south of this area & there are no other airfields in the area where this object landed.  This is my first ufo sighting.;36.0428;-89.3916
