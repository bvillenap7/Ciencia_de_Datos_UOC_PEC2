NW TN TRIANGLE.;1978-10-12 21:00:00;2 hours;NW TN TRIANGLE. In Dyersburg, Tn (located in NW Tennessee) in 1978 I was outside with a flashlight star gazing when I saw a really bright light in the distance.  Just as a lark I decided to point my flashlight at the object and went round and round -- really fast.  The light started changing -- different colors and really bright.  I was amazed!. An airplane flew really close to the object, passed it, and when it was way ahead, the light darted at the plane.  This happened twice. Well I kept watching playing with my flash light and the light started moving my way. It came closer until it was above my head.  The object was shaped like a triangle, with a light on each corner. It made no noise -- none. It scared me so bad I ran to the neighbors house and pretended I was just visiting.  I didn't tell them what I had seen because I was afraid they would think I was crazy.  When I came out after about 15 minutes I saw the object moving slowly toward the south west.;36.0428;-89.3916
