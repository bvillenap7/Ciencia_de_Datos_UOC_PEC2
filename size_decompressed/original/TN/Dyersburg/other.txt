Craft in the sky that had bright lights and vanished right before our eyes.;2003-09-28 01:00:00;10 seconds;A craft in the sky that had bright lights and vanished right before our eyes. In the eastern sky was what appeared to be a large slanted airplane hoovering extremely close to the ground.  There were 4 bright white lights and you could actually make out the shape of the aircraft.  It made no noise at all and as soon as I saw it I told my children to look and as we were watching it vanished.  The sky was very clear tonight and the craft was in plain view.;36.0428;-89.3916
Loud noise - not sighting;2012-03-20 14:30:00;2 seconds;loud noise - not sighting Last Tuesday, March 20, 2012, at about 2:30 p.m. (cst), my wife and I were startled by a very loud boom, like a sonic boom.  In my bed at time of occurance, I felt a slight vibration.  Going outside to investigate we saw no clues, but about 18-20 neighbors were also in their front yards also looking.   I'm 64 and have never experienced anything like this before.  This is the first report I have made to you and my statement is complete accurate.  RDH - West Tennessee.
