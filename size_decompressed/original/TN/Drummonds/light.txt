I was at a friends spending the night and he had said that he has seen strange objects in the sky in early morning, at around 3:00 AM and I had to see it, so I went outside at 3:30 AM and a yellow light was flying in a straight line and then it was like it saw us and moved up in elevation from about 100ft-500ft in the air toward us and its light then turned white and just staid there like a star for around thirty minutes and then flew off into the night sky.This was only the first sighting, but I came back in the winter, but that was a diffrent date, so I will report another.
