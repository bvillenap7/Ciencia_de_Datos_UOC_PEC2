I saw one disk shaped object in bright daylight. It was moving at a fast pace and it was silver and reflecting light. I am familiar with weather balloons and this was not one. It was lower than an aircraft, low enough where I could see the light reflecting and determine shape and color quite easily.;36.3031;-88.3126000000001
