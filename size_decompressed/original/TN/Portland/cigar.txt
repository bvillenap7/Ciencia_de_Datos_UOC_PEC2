2 white cigar shaped crafts.  Daytime.;2014-09-24 16:00:00;2 minutes;2 white cigar shaped crafts.  Daytime. 2 white cigar shaped aircraft flying opposite directions.  No wings visable.  No sound.  No contrails.  Clear skies.  Unsure of altitude.  Other witness looked up and asked what are those?  Caught my attention and we began conversing.  Didnt look like planes. My  Dad was a pilot, so very familiar with identifying specific aircraft in sky at many altitudes.  Had witnessed the same days before, just one craft...  But figured light was playing some sort of optical illusion.  They were flying at a normal aircraft speed it seemed, but dissapeared into sky quicker than a normal aircraft would.;36.5686;-86.5142000000001
