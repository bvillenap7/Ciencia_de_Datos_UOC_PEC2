Scott County UFO;2012-05-05 21:00:00;Still going on;Scott County UFO Just happened to look out my bedroom window and saw a really really bright white light in the sky. It was round looking at first I thought it was a star but it was much bigger and brighter then any star I saw. I noticed it started moving just a little slowly it moved about a foot or 2 and stopped. It sat there then I called my mother who lives next door she also saw it then about an hour later.  I look back out and notice it gone.   However my mother could still see it from her house. It must have dropped down so much lower cause I couldnt see it since there is a big tree between my house and hers.  Then I saw a light flashing like an airplane looks but it was flying low coming toward that directions and then it goes and disappears in the tree. I see flashing like taking pictures.  Then I see nothing a couple of minutes later I see flashing more to the right then nothing.  Now I don't see anything but my mother still sees the light.  She says it is huge and flammin! g up.;36.5053;-84.5293
