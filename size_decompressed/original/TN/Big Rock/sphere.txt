Large white/silver spherical object with smaller black object in close proximity over Fort Campbell, KY.;2012-10-12 14:30:00;20 minutes;Large white/silver spherical object with smaller black object in close proximity over Fort Campbell, KY. While driving on HWY 120 in Stewart county, observed a large white/silver spherical object with what appeared to be another, smaller black object below it.  Object appeared to be stationary, maintaining altitude at around apporximately 10-12,000 ft. AGL over the western edge of the Fort Campbell military reservation.  Observed for about 5 minutes, with several witnesses stopping their vehicles and confirming what I was seeing.  Continued driving west to Dover, TN and could still see object clearly from HWY 79 5-6 miles further away, it did not appear to have changed position. Initial assumption was that I had observed a weather balloon, but the size of the object was much too large.  Possibly a hot air balloon, but seems unusual to see one solid white/silver in color.
