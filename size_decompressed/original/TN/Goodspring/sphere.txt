I could clearly see 2 lines one that was above the very center of the orb/ball, and one that was just below the center of the orb/ball.   All of a sudden it changed its direction and at an absurd speed darted upward at an angle toward the south for about 2 sec then hovered for about 2 sec and then fast like a shooting star went up and at the opposite angle toward the north out of view.;35.1169;-87.1316
