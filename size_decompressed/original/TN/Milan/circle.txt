Large elongated diamond formation of 15 silent red circle lights;2013-09-21 08:45:00;3 minutes;large elongated diamond formation of 15 silent red circle lights 15 silent red lights in a long formation slowly drifted across the sky, we watch them until we couldn't see them anymore.  They pretty much stayed in the same formation but seem rather close and larger than the stars behind them.  It was almost like an elongated diamond formation with more lights towards the center than the ends ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
