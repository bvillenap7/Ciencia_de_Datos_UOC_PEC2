A  chrome, sphere shaped object  that flew into a small cloud.;2004-06-16 12:30:00;10seconds;A  chrome, sphere shaped object  that flew into a small cloud. I had gone out to the local YMCA to walk on an outdoor track they have. As I was walking, something in the sky caught my eye. When I looked up, there was a bright silver(chrome), sphere shaped object approximatly 1000 ft. in the sky. It was moving slowly at a forty-five degree angle toward a small cloud. I just stopped to watch as the object entered the cloud. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. It was not a plane or a helicopter,and it made no sound. I stood for awhile waiting for the object to come out of the cloud, but it never did. I never saw it again. There may be a ration explaination for this,but I have never seen anything like it before.;35.9235;-88.7712999999999
Large chrome sphere shaped craft seen in Tennessee;2005-06-24 12:00:00;25 min.;Large chrome sphere shaped craft seen in Tennessee I was walking on a local YMCA outdoor track around 12:00 noon, when something in the sky caught my attention. It looked like a large chrome(silver)sphere shaped object moving slowly in the sky behind the YMCA building. It looked to be maybe 4000 to 5000 ft in the air. As I kept watching the object it moved upward to my left at a forty-five degree angle into a small cloud. I never took my eyes off the cloud thinking sooner or later it had to reappear somewhere beyond this cloud,but it never did. I finished my walk and never saw the craft again.  I might have been a weather balloon,but I've never seen one that large and able to move in a straight line at forty-five degrees on it's on power.  If anyone has any idea as to what it might have been I would certainly like to know.;35.9235;-88.7712999999999
