planes without wings;2009-05-29 15:00:00;3 minutes;planes without wings I and a friend were on a country back road when we witnessed what appeared to be a mid air refueling.  Until I noticed the “planes” were closer to the ground than they appeared.  I also noticed the “planes” didn’t have wings.  It looked like two fuselages moving slowly through the sky.  We watched for several minutes and the objects seemed to be barely moving. I turned my back for just a second to see that we were still in our lane.  When I turned back they were gone. My friend said this was his third time seeing something in the skies here.;36.3085;-83.5972
