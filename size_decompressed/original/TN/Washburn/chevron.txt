slow moving chevron or V shaped object  with strobes and silent;1977-08-01 23:30:00;2-3 min;slow moving chevron or V shaped object  with strobes and silent My wife and I were returning home from Knoxville sometime around midnight. We were living out in the country on top of a knoll surrounded by cleared open pasture land. The night dark and overcast but not raining and no stars were visible.  As we exited the car and started walking to the house something caused me to look up. I then spotted the lights on a vehicle passing directly above us. These strobe lights were in a “V” configuration that began at the lead point and traveled down the leading edge of both wings simultaneously.  The object was quite large or quite low as it took up a large section of the sky above us but we were not able to accurately judge this due to the weather conditions that night that did not provide any stars behind it to outline the size and shape of it nor were there any ground lights to illuminate it.  As we watched, this object made a slow turn to the south towards Knoxville and moved out of sight. At no time did we hear any noise from this object or any other lights.  I have wondered about this for years now and have tried to debunk the experience as being a plane or a balloon but as yet can not. This object when spotted was traveling in an east to westerly direction and performed a slow 90 degree bank to the south.  It was moving at speed that would cause a commercial aircraft to stall and too large to be completely silent. We would have at least heard the air flowing across the wings and/or control surfaces. If it had been a balloon then we would have heard the engine as it moved southward. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));36.3085;-83.5972
