During this time, we always see this strange orb in the sky that moves sort of slowly, and disappears into thin air in the blink of an eye.  There are no trees for it to hide behind, it's just gone.  It's orange/red and slightly bigger than a star.  It doesn't flicker and it's definitely not a plane or chopper.  It has no sound.   I got binoculars one time and viewed it and I saw that it had tiny, circular holes in it.   My dogs were behaving strangely and acted like they were being attacked.  They ran into the house.  (They were already used to the fireworks from past years).   I know others have seen it.  In fact, I saw it tonight.;36.1958520512821;-83.2810839743601

Realized it wasn't Mars when we noticed it moved around the sky in the same vicinity above the left of our house.  We have witnessed it in the sky every night since, including tonight August 11th 2018. The object is orange-ish red in color and looks to emit fire or gas of some sort around it. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the object may be Mars.  PD));36.1958520512821;-83.2810839743601
