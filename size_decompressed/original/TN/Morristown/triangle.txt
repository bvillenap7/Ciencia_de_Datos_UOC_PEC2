Huge, triangular craft with six white rectangular lights on the bottom witnessed in  EastTennessee;2000-09-28 20:30:00;8 minutes;Huge, triangular craft with six white rectangular lights on the bottom witnessed in  EastTennessee At approximately 22:30, three friends and myself observed a large white light in the distance, that appeared to be rising upwards. After watching it we determined it was not rising upwards, but coming toward us. We then noticed a flashing red light approached the craft at the 1 o'clock position, and remained beside it for a moment, before moving ahead of the craft at about the 7 o'clock position. It steadily came toward us and we noticed that the small flashing red light in front of the craft appeared to be a jet, and the large craft was following it.  As it began to move above us, we no longer saw the one large white light we had seen before, but we saw six fairly large white lights on the bottom of the craft.  These lights were rectangular in shape, and looked very similar to flourescent lighting fixtures you would find in a garage or kitchen.  The larger craft stayed very close behind the jet (obviously following its' flight pattern), but made no noise whatsoever.  The sound from the jet's engine was all that could be heard.  It was moving much too fast to be any type of balloon, or anything like that.  As it got directly over us, we could make out a somewhat triangular outline, and saw what appeared to be a semi-circular shaft coming down from between the six rectangular lights.  We wondered amongst ourselves if this could be some sort of secret military plane, and we noticed that the large craft had no flashing lights, only the six lights on the underside.  This craft was extremely large and absolutely dwarfed the jet it was following.  We watched the flight pattern as it seemed to be going back from where it came from.  The flight pattern was almost a complete circle!  We don't have any idea what we saw, but we wish someone has witnessed something similar, and will be able to provide a clue or two for us.;36.1958520512821;-83.2810839743601
MUFON report /Trucker reports  hovering triangle over Interstate;2005-01-26 21:00:00;15 minutes;MUFON report /Trucker reports  hovering triangle over Interstate A tractor-trailer driver called to report that he was driving north on Interstate 81 at approx. 21:00 hours when he saw what appeared to be three bright reddish lights ahead of him  in the sky. He drove for several minutes  noting that the object appeared to be hovering as it drew closer. He arrived at a point where he could safely pull off the interstate and did so, exited his truck and watched the strange object . He described the object as a dark triangular object, backlit by the bright sky(nearly full moon) with three large reddish orange lights affixed to each point. The object was hovering at some 45 degrees to his position and was the relative size of a golfball at arm's length. He described the object as slowly rotating but making no other discernable movements. After several more minutes, the object simply disappeared. The witness is an Air Force veteran, therefore a trained witness and quite adamant that this was no conventional aircraft.;36.1958520512821;-83.2810839743601
Triangle shape hovering in mid air;2008-04-17 21:00:00;Approx. 5 min.;Triangle shape hovering in mid air April 17, 2007 Morristown, Tennessee Approx. 9:00 pm  	I was on my way home from Wal-Mart and when I got close to my house I noticed a triangle shape in the sky with three lights.  Two of the lights were green and one red, and each light was in a corner of the triangle.  It looked as if it was moving at first but when I got closer I realized it wasn't and rolled my windows down.  It was extremely close to the ground maybe a few miles up not many and it hovered for nearly half a minute while I was stopped on the road and I didn't hear anything that you would hear from a plane.  When it started moving again it moved so fast that even though I tried I couldn't follow it and was out of sight into the clouds in mere seconds.  I have never seen any manmade aircraft that could do that and am still shocked beyond belief.;36.1958520512821;-83.2810839743601
triangular shaped craft in sky over east tennessee;2010-05-26 23:15:00;2 hours;triangular shaped craft in sky over east tennessee In the sky I saw a type of what looked like just a blinking star.  After looking through binoculars it looked triangular with 3 lights.  One was amber,red,and white. It seemed to move in weird ways. It would shoot left,right,circles,and a zig zag pattern.  I had 2 friends come over and they witnessed it doing the same thing.  I even called friends in a different county about 15-20 miles away and him and three others saw the same thing I was seeing.  It always stayed near the same spot in the sky but moved around.  I have witnessed satellites,asteroids, shooting stars,jets and planes in the sky at night and this moved like nothing I have ever seen.my 2 friends were in the military that also witnessed it and they said no plane in the military they know of can move that quick in that type of formation that they know of. It also every now and then seemed to shoot out red beams of light out the side of the object.either it was shooting something out or something was coming in.;36.1958520512821;-83.2810839743601
UFO, 3 larger lights form triangle, 1 smaller dim light on top, all non flashing, fast/silent flight, military jet in pursuit (slower).;2014-04-22 21:00:00;2-3 minutes;UFO, 3 larger lights form triangle, 1 smaller dim light on top, all non flashing, fast/silent flight, military jet in pursuit (slower). I was outside walking when I noticed a large solid ball of yellowish/white glowing light.  I thought I was seeing a planet at first (but way too large).   It appeared to not be moving, so I called for my father and grandmother to look. We watched, it began moving closer until it flew over us at a much lower altitude than any commercial jet would fly, and was moving to other horizon, and by the time I got to the backyard to finish watching, it had vanished.   When I was in backyard trying to find it again, a Military Jet appeared in same flight path about 2 minutes later, and my father and I confirmed that it was a military jet from our military experience, and we knew it was a jet from the obvious sound we heard once it had moved on as well.   The UFO had a very fast/smooth flight with no noise, 3 lights form triangle/very Bright, 1 small dimmer light on top, all non flashing (couldn't make out the individual lights until it was over head, at distance it was huge g! lowing ball of hovering light).  We are in shock.  I'm 30 years old (Navy Brat), Father is 62 (20 Year Navy Veteran), grandmother age 86.;36.1958520512821;-83.2810839743601
