We were near the side of the lake way up where some trees were and where we set our tent and campfire up. My uncle stayed there for a while. Me, my uncle, my cousin, and his girlfriend were sitting there at the camp the first night we stayed. It was a clear sky and stars covered the sky and it was a full moon. We looked up at the sky after my cousin was telling us about how we never know what's up there. The galaxy is infinite and things like that that me and him was always talking about. We looked up and looked at the stars and we saw a flying ball of bright yellow light soaring slowly through the sky. I saw it first, then my cousin pointed it out. It moved slowly across the sky. It appeared not to be a shooting star because it was moving so slow for a long time. It finally reached a point where it seemed to have disappeared into the atmosphere and a bright orange light appeared. My mouth was opened the whole time and I never realized it. I never saw anything like that before. We saw a jet near the object before it disappeared. The UFO never flashed a light. The jet did. It was spectacular. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Some thing falls from the sky.;2009-06-03 00:00:00;2sec;Some thing falls from the sky. At some time around 12 midnight I was facing west and saw what looked like a plane fall to the earth.  The light was orange like a aircraft light but it did not blink.  When it fell it just winked out.  A hour later I was facing east and saw another one do the exact same thing.

The first night occurred r;2020-07-10 00:00:00;2 months;For the past two months, at night, I've been witnessing this strange bright light outside my bedroom window.  The first night occurred roughly around 4-4:30am, as it did for many nights to follow.  This light almost looks like a bright star but it twinkles many colors, like red, blue, white, green very very rapidly...more so than a star.  It faded in and out and with pictures taken zoomed in, took many shapes.  Some are round and somewhat triangular.  It appears very dim in photos, to a degree.  The light appeared to sit almost still on the east side of the sky from my bedroom window view, but just tonight appeared on the west side.  There is always a small star-looking light near it that twinkles too but not as bright;36.1958520512821;-83.2810839743601
