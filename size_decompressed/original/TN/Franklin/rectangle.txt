Close encounter/Franklin Tn.;1980-12-01 21:00:00;3 minutes;Summary : Close encounter/Franklin Tn. Coming down Old Hillsboro Rd., in the winter of 1980, I saw a very brilliant light. It was low to the ground, sort of shadowing the top of the trees. In other words the craft was following the contour of the landscape. As it got closer the light divided into two lights of which they appeared to be some type of flood light. It also looked like shafts of light the farther away it got. It proceeded to come in and the closer it came to the road the lower it got. I was so amazed with the sight that I stopped the car and got out, my wife was in the car with me. I had completely cut the motor of the vehicle off. This craft was flying soundlessly over the road and us.  It was shaped like a rectangular box, with a slanted plexiglass looking windshield. It was moving very slowly, and my wife was telling me to get into the car and lets go. It was a full moon night and we both saw the ufo very plainly. Not like some kind of light in the sky, we saw the entire vehicle. And I have not been the same until this very day. My wife and I are not mental patients and have never been. We don't drink or do any type of drugs. We attend church regularly and are the parents of four children.;35.9285744680851;-86.8588223404257

An orange ball shaped object suddenly arose in west, changed to a rectangle going east, light began pulsating before it disappeared.;2016-05-29 20:28:00;2 minutes;An orange ball shaped object suddenly arose in west, changed to a rectangle going east, light began pulsating before it disappeared. An object suddenly but slowly rose up in the western sky above the trees very close to where we were standing.  It then began traveling east right across our sight line.  It changed shape from a ball to a rectangular shape and the color shifted from orange to white.  It was completely silent.  After it crossed in front of us, the light began to pulsate several times.  Our view was then partially blocked by some tree branches as it continued to pulsate and then never reappeared from behind the tree branches as expected.  It just completely vanished as if it slipped behind some clouds but the sky was completely clear at the time.;35.9285744680851;-86.8588223404257
