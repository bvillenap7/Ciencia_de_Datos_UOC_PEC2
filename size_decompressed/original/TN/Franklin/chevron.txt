V shaped blurry craft with lights.  Extremely fast velocity;2001-11-18 04:35:00;2 sec;V shaped blurry craft with lights.  Extremely fast velocity I was out watching the Leonids shower at around 4:30 when I saw just above the horizon, a V shaped craft.  It was fading in and out as if it was a Star Trek cloaking device.  It had lights on the outward V.  It moved from the North to the South linearly, amazingly fast without a sound.  Absolutely amazing.  A skeptic would claim that it was part of the meteor shower, but it was most definitely not.  Very clear night out.  It was above the horizon in the western sky;35.9285744680851;-86.8588223404257
