Diamond shaped bright light stationary over Franklin TN.;2013-11-27 17:00:00;30 minutes;Diamond shaped bright light stationary over Franklin TN.  On way to dinner with my son we noticed the light and at first thought it was a helicopter, but after a few minutes, saw it was not moving and was too large.  There were no stars in the early evening sky.   We saw it for approximately 30 mins while driving and after we pulled up to the restaurant.  After dinner (approx. 1 hour) came out and it was gone.
