My family and I were driving home from a grocery store when I saw an U.F.O. out the side window.;2003-04-07 14:30:00;7 Seconds;My family and I were driving home from a grocery store when I saw an U.F.O. out the side window. It was a sunny day. My mom, my two brothers and one sister and I were driving along in our van. I was watching an airplane way up high in the sky making a trail of exhaust. It went behind a cloud and the trail disappeared. It came out again and the trail started forming again. Then a little white dot in the sky caught my attention. At first I didnâ€™t think much about it until I saw how fast it was going. It was going faster then the airplane and was lower to the horizon, too. It was pretty far behind the airplane, so I don't know if it was chasing it or not. It looked like it was spinning. It was kind of a shiny white, and was an oval disk shape. I couldn't tell if it made a sound or not because the van was making to much noise to hear. We were driving east and I was looking out the window north. It was about three miles east of Franklin, Tennessee. I watched it for about 6 or 7 seconds before it disappeared behind a cloud.

5 gold lights in Franklin sky;2010-09-06 20:35:00;4 mins;5 gold lights in Franklin sky   I just witnessed 4 bright gold spheres skim across the sky slowly, but made no sound. They came across a treeline, just past my pool, somewhat low, and relatively close, but literally made no sound. Then a 5th one came and then they all turned heading south towards Nashville.
