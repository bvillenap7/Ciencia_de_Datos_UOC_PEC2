circular object appeared to be followed by Black military helicopters;2008-04-01 17:30:00;3 minutes;circular object appeared to be followed by Black military helicopters 3 evenings in April on my way home from work 17:00 in Franklin/Brentwood I had seen a small circular object that was very reflective silver almost like a mirror or highly polished metal zipping through the air heading West almost parallel with next road over from me which would be Moores lane.  I've seen or caught these images before several times before during previous months, but never paid much attention due to air traffic in this area from Nashville international airport.  Once I've seen them I've more actively seek them out and for the next 2 days I saw them briefly each night. Couldn't figure them out, couldn't find anyone to collaborate my story.  It was on the 3rd night which would have been on a Friday I was heading home, it was 16:00 ( we get out early on Fridays ).  No objects yet, I had been seeing them from Mallory station road for the previous 2 days.  I proceeded home as normal, I was now on Murray lane/ Holly berry gap heading towards the 431.  I came down off a hard turn on a very steep incline which winds down into a valley.  It was then that I seen this same small very bright circular object in the sky I caught it in my sight for about 3 seconds as it flew over the hills ahead of me, I appeared to be slowing down and disappeared into the tree or hills.  As I came around and head down the road towards the hills I saw 2 black military helicopters they looked like Comanche's and they were moving in a direct line towards where I last saw that object.  They copters were flying low and as I moved out of range they appeared to be hovering above that hill where I saw the circular object disappear.  Something was going on some where between Murray lane and Old Hickory Blvd.  I heard nothing on the news and have told very few people.

Not sure what it was and can not find anything anywhere on it. There was an aircraft looking to be on approach to BNA that was north of the object neither seamed to react to each other.;35.9285744680851;-86.8588223404257

I've been seeing this same thing off in a distance for a few nights but this was right in front of me.   I've also seen strange objects in the past 6 months that I've never seen before.   My dog has been sensing strange energy fields.;35.9285744680851;-86.8588223404257
no sound;2019-05-06 12:00:00;15;no sound A friend and I were on our smoke break In Franklin, Tn (near Nashville), when we noticed a flying white object in the sky.  It looked like to could have 3 wings around the circle object but it was moving too fast to see.   We first saw these white fluffly things falling from the sky is what made us look up when we noticed the flying white object.  It was going too fast to be a plane or helicopter.  It was going all over the sky.   We first thought we were seeing things, but we were out there for about 15 mins and it was still flying around.   I am not sure what this could have been, so I decided to search google thatâ€™s when I found your website.;35.9285744680851;-86.8588223404257
Triangular Orbs;2019-10-14 17:37:00;5 Minutes;Triangular Orbs I was driving home with a sibling of mine when we saw three yellow-orange circles in the sky.  They were in a triangular pattern, and were stationary.  We made it back where we were staying, and started to unload the groceries.  All of the sudden, I saw one of the orbs return.  We watched it for a few, and I managed to get a photo and a video of what happened. It disappeared rather quickly after I started filming.This happened near the Goose Creek Inn on Peytonsville Road.;35.9285744680851;-86.8588223404257
