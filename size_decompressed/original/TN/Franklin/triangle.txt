Large round light covering belly of craft. completely still in the air. absolutely no sound. over a very populated neighborhood in a low lying area, compared to the rest of the town.  i cannot believe that no one else saw it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  Our comment would be that if everyone is frightened to come forward and report what he/she saw, then no one will know about their sightings.  This fact seems tautological, in our opinion.

Black Triangle or dark colored unidentified object south of Nashville at dusk;2007-09-25 18:40:00;1-2 minutes;Black Triangle or dark colored unidentified object south of Nashville at dusk It was around 6:40 or just a little after and I was walking into the Home Depot in Cool Springs just off of I-65. The sun was setting so it was not completely light out at the time. Two people, whom I didn't see, were walking out had stopped and pointed towards the sky looking at something and then left ( as I was later told). As I was almost in the door i heard  another person say something like  look at that glider up there. So I walked back out in front of the store and tried to see the glider. Two other people now were looking at the glider. The object was located east of where I was standing and was high enough to be visible from the light of the setting sun. At first it was hard to find but when I did I immediately didn't think that it was a glider, and by glider i mean hang glider. A glider would probably not be flying that high near a major city (Nashville air traffic flies right over the area) or when it was getting dark. It was high up in the air, somewhere between 7,000 and 10,000 feet possibly, and was very dark colored, most likely black. It was triangular in shape. There were no lights on it to indicate it was an airplane or otherwise. It appeared to be moving very slowly north, northeast as best as I could tell. One of the witnesses towards the end said look theres two. The object or possibly objects either moved away or it was just too dark to see them after a couple of minutes. Personally I am aware of Black Triangles and their observances near cities and interstates. I have never observed a ufo before, although I am interested in the subject. I wish i had a camera with zoom to take a picture at the time. I'll have to keep one with zoom on hand now just in case.;35.9285744680851;-86.8588223404257
Black triangular, round or rectangular object in broad daylight or sunset.;2008-10-31 08:30:00;Minutes;Black triangular, round or rectangular object in broad daylight or sunset. Black triangular, round or rectangular object.  If anyone sights one of these around Franklin, TN - it's not a UFO, but merely a solar-heated hot air balloon made from black trash bags. They're not always triangular, but do always contain black material which absorbs heat from the sun.  I release them with tags hoping they are found.  They have flown over 700 miles in one day. Sorry if this doesn't qualify as a report I just want to get the word out so people may know what they're seeing if they encounter one of these balloons floating around in the sky.  They do have a very UFO-like appearance, especially to someone who has never heard of a solar balloon before (which would be a lot of people, which is why I'm sending this). I hope this is informative to those who may have seen one of these around Franklin.   I do have fans of my Web site ((commercial web-address deleted)) and there are other balloon enthusiasts all over the country so obviously Franklin won't be the only place they could be seen. ((NUFORC Note:  We cannot confirm that the objects reported from this area of the country are balloons.  Frankly, we are skeptical.  PD));35.9285744680851;-86.8588223404257
Black Triangle Sighting in Franklin Tennessee, May 14, 2013;2013-05-14 21:00:00;10 seconds;Black Triangle Sighting in Franklin Tennessee, May 14, 2013 In all my 45 years I thought I would never have the opportunity to say this, but the other night I saw a UFO. More specifically, I saw a black triangle. Let me just state that this is probably going to be one of the most boring reports that you have received, but I felt I should share it none-the-less. On the night of 5/14/2013, between 2045 and 2100 central time, I opened my front door to let my dog outside.  I followed her, and just like always, I happened to look up into the sky.  There it was, moving swiftly and silently, directly over my home. My first thought was that it was some type of drone aircraft, then I immediately realized I heard no sound.  What truly caught and kept my attention was the lighted tips of the object, which formed a perfect triangle.  Also the lights were not very bright, however they were white (non-colored)  All three lights seemed to radiate at the same intensity, and the best way I can describe that is to adjust a dimmer lightswitch to about 70%. Another thing struck me as interesting as I reflect on what I saw, that it was flying in a &quotskewed&quot position.  Let me try to describe:  If you imagine an airplane, with a light at the nose and a light at the end of each wing, the light at the nose will always be in the lead, and the wing lights will always stay equidistant in their position, and  uniform as the plane moves forward.  The same would be true if there was no light on the nose, but two lights at the tips of the wing and one on the tail.  From a view on the ground, thee flat side with the two lights at the tips/edges would be moving forward (in the lead), followed by the light at the tail. This object flew forward as if it was turned at about 30 degrees off the center axis, so I could not tell what was in the &quotlead&quot.  It only kept its  uniform,  steady shape as it flew. This entire sighting lasted approximately 10 seconds.  Of course, I had no camera with me, and I did run in and inform my wife of what I saw, and unfortunately there were no other witnesses. I recognized what it was from a historical fascination with &quotstuff&quot like this.  I had read enough non fiction about such instances to know that black triangles and the &quotcigar&quot shaped crafts are some of the most recognized shapes that have been recorded. So, I knew exactly what it was when I saw it. I want to try to contribute best I can to what I saw, so here are some specifics:  Shape of Tips-I did some internet research and found many descriptions as to the shape of the tips, ranging from &quotboxy&quot to &quotpointed&quot.  The tips on this sighting were definitely more blunt and rounded, not pointed. Speed...well, I could not judge the speed but it was moving fairly fast for the sighting to only last for about 10 seconds, especially from the point of view I had. Size-If you take a half dollar out of your pocket and hold it between your index finger and thumb, and then extend your arm above you and look at the flat side of the quarter, that is about the size of the object from my ground perspective.  I have read that some witnesses state that these things are very very large.  Well, if they are, then from my view on the ground and the size approximation I described, it was fairly high up. Other features-some articles I have seen reference a light (red) in the center of the underside of the craft.  There were no other lights visible on the object that I saw. Direction:  I looked at google maps and found my home, and judging by its direction, it was traveling due north.  If you continue due north from Franklin TN, you will pass by the western edge of the city limits of Nashville. I hope this helps for your records.  Again, I never thought I would be reporting anything such as this, so this has truly been a fun exercise.  I just wish I had more to share.;35.9285744680851;-86.8588223404257

Flying bright triangular object hovering over neighborhood;2015-11-21 19:32:00;5 minutes;Flying bright triangular object hovering over neighborhood My cousin, my child, and I were driving coming down a hill and I noticed bright lights in the sky right above the tree line.  At first, I believed it was an airplane, but it was too low and the lights did not move instead they remained stationary.  My cousin sitting next to me in the passender seat also noticed these light without me saying anything.  I told him to try and record it and we did catch it on video. What caught our attention was how low the lights were to the ground the shape as we approacued closers was triangular and had about 6-8 very bright lights surrounding the triangular shape.  The object was directly in top of the neighborhood we were heading towrds.  The light then proceeded to move across the street and directly above the tree line in the neighborhood across the street from our destination.  We lowered our windows and did not hear any noise coming from the flying object, it was completely silent outside. In the video you can here me saying,  is it landing?  As it appeared the object was falling towrds the ground very slowly.  Then it started to move along the tree line parallel to the road we were driving on. As we turned into the neighborhood of our destination, we felt uneasy because the object was literally flying parallel to our neighborhood and we still had a very clear view of it.  The flying object appeared very large in size and triangular, the lights were bright white, did not flash, and seemed as if they were attached to the object. We got to our destination and looked out the house window to see if it was still visible, but the trees obstructed our view.  The whole incident lasted about 5 minuses that we personally saw, though there is no way of knowing how long it had been hovering above the spot where we first saw it.;35.9285744680851;-86.8588223404257
Multiple craft, flying both n formation & on their own for about 2 hours, with 2 huge triangles & one box shaped craft shining a beam;2018-08-02 20:00:00;2 hours;Multiple craft, flying both n formation & on their own for about 2 hours, with 2 huge triangles & one box shaped craft shining a beam. There were multiple craft seen almost in every direction for 2 hours or more.  It was unbelievable.  There were craft flying in formation, there were craft hovering, there was single UFOs at times that would go from sitting still to shooting off at great speeds.  There was also tons of airplanes in the area that looked like they were flying in search grids it looked like & that went on for about an hour or more and then died down & went back to a normal minimal amount of air traffic.   I was with my brother & his two sons & we all saw most of the activity.  I say most of the activity because my nephews are quite young & would excitedly just look around in all directions & not quite focusing on specific parts of the sky at times, but I know they saw quite a bit of the unusual activity.   I have watched the sky for many years looking for anomalous activity & would be lucky to see one unusual light in the sky for just a few seconds before, but this amount of activity f! or the duration of time tonight was beyond mind blowing.  My brother and I were like two excited kids as all this happened tonight.;35.9285744680851;-86.8588223404257
