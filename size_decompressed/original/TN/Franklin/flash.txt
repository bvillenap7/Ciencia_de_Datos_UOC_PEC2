Green flashes of light, occurring in short distances, every few minutes.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sightings or meteors??  PD));2015-12-14 23:59:00;Hours;Green flashes of light, occurring in short distances, every few minutes. On the night of December 14th, before during and after my drive from Murfreesboro to Franklin, I saw (similarly described by others) a small flash of a green light going through the sky.  I sat and watched for hours, counting up to 41 as I saw them flying by every few minutes.   The 19th had a small explosion in the air bursting out red and white.  The 29th went over above me and I saw a similar explosion.   Before I left Murfreesboro my uncle and girlfriend each witnessed one or two themselves.  If someone could please shine some light on what I've discovered I would genuinely appreciate it. ((NUFORC Note:  Sightings or meteors??  PD));35.9285744680851;-86.8588223404257
