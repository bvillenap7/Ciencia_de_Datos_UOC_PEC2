30-50 red/orange fireballs seen over Brentwood and Coolsprings;2011-07-30 22:00:00;15 minutes;30-50 red/orange fireballs seen over Brentwood and Coolsprings July 30th 2011 at 9:50 PM  On July 30th my girlfriend and I were driving to go grab some food when my girlfriend pointed out these strange balls of light hovering in front of the car.  My first reaction was that they were fireworks because of how they looked.  However, we realized very quickly that none of these objects were moving.   They were completely stationary. At this point our view was blocked by buildings so I pulled the car around the block to try and see if we could get another glimpse.  We were able to pull behind a vacant building with an adjacent field and parked. At this point the lights had seemed to move more into the distance.  My guess is somewhere over Brentwood anywhere from Brentwood High School or the WSM Tower. Also the number of lights had grown to around 50.  These lights did move this time but in almost figure eight motions, some even seemed to come together.   They started from around tree height up to cloud level which the clouds were low because of a thunderstorm earlier. My girlfriend was able to get picture and video of this event.  Also, while we were there about 20 other people came to view this as well. After about 15 minutes the lights in no particular order very quickly disappeared.  Some seemed to do a quick flash before they would disappear.  It was maybe 30-45 seconds before they were gone once they started. At this point my girlfriend and I got in my car to try to ride over to where we thought the lights were over.  To do this we had to go over a large hill.  Once over the hill at a red light we witnessed what I would guess was a Black Hawk helicopter just hovering right above the tree line pointing in the direction of the lights.  There were no lights on the helicopter it reminded me of being blacked out for military operations. We drove for another hour or so but never saw the lights again.;35.9285744680851;-86.8588223404257

Pulsating red light in the western sky about 30 degrees above horizon, moving slowly, then disappears.;2013-10-09 05:00:00;1 minute;Pulsating red light in the western sky about 30 degrees above horizon, moving slowly, then disappears. I am a real estate agent, and sometimes I get up early to do catch up on contracts and work, etc.  I was sitting in my armchair looking out my window, looking due West from my house in Franklin, I saw a pulsing RED light in the sky.  There are some red flashing lights that are radio towers that i see all the time.  It was above those in the horizon, but still lower than most aircrafts that fly by.  The light intensity would change all the time, brighter and then duller.  If it was moving, it was moving slowly.  The light would go out, then come back on intensely.  It did this for about a minute, then it just disappeared out of the sky completely.  I watched for a while and didn't see anything else after staring in the sky for another 20 mins.  Never seen anything like it.;35.9285744680851;-86.8588223404257
Slow moving flame, 700-1000 feet away.;2014-02-13 18:00:00;5 minutes;Slow moving flame, 700-1000 feet away. We were driving to our daughter's house in Franklin, TN, when we saw what looked like a flame in the sky, too low to the ground to be an aircraft.  It was moving too slowly to be an aircraft, but it appeared to be 700-1000 feet from where we were.  We pulled over and watched it for a few moments and it slowly moved on and disappeared.;35.9285744680851;-86.8588223404257
Fireball moving in the night sky.;2014-10-29 19:00:00;1 minute;Fireball moving in the night sky. I was sitting on our back deck with another friend as we witnessed an orange light, moving from west to east, almost in the trajectory and speed of an airplane.  We had seen many airplanes that night flying above us, but this was orange in color, and instead of having blinking lights on the wings, this would get brighter orange and bigger in size like it was pulsating while it moved.  It would totally fade out to black,  And then pulsate again while it held this horizontal trajectory.  Finally it just disappeared.  It was very odd.;35.9285744680851;-86.8588223404257
2 orange balls of light approaching from the W and moving ESE slowly and silently, disappeared one by one as get closer.;2016-01-23 18:25:00;3 minutes;2 orange balls of light approaching from the West and moving East-SE slowly and silently, disappeared one by one as get closer. I was looking out at the snow we had today and out on the herizon were two bright orange balls of light, rising out of the hills and moving towards my house.   They approached from the West in perfect equal distance, the entire time they flew.  There was no sound, and as they got closer to me, the orange hue got brighter.  Almost immediately, one of the lights pulsed, and then went out...and about 10 seconds later, the second light did the same.  I caught the whole thing on video and there were tons of kids outside playing in the snow at the time, not sure if any of them saw it, but it was clearly visible because it was already dark outside and these lights were very noticeable.   I took a 2-minute video of the whole thing.  And this was weird.  It definitely wasn't military planes either, I watch all the planes as they come in, and know the flight paths to BNA.  This was different, there were no blinking safety lights on these and they were fluorescent orange with a bit of a hue around them...and the lights were too close together to be planes, and too high to be drones.  Not to mention the lights disappeared as they got near me.;35.9285744680851;-86.8588223404257
