The crafts were oval in shape and lights were a blue hue spinning very quickly around the crafts.  The craft to the left of the sky was moving in an unusual pattern left to right in a zig zag like pattern before it just vanished.  The second craft was off to the right moving towards the first when it arrived to the exact location of the first craft.  It then slowly descended behind the tree line all the while red and white lights flashing. There was absolutely no sound whatsoever from either craft.   Growing up on military bases and relocating from a very large military community in VA I would know how to recognize the sounds of military aircraft.  I do believe the second craft was a man made craft although I could hear no sound.  There tends to be a lot of activity in my area.  I just discovered this reporting page today.  I will keep you posted.;35.9285744680851;-86.8588223404257
