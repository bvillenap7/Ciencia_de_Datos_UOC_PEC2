Orange horseshoe-shaped, silent, moved much faster then any aircraft, came almost to complete stop, then proceeded and vanished.;2015-09-11 00:01:00;3 seconds;Orange horse shoe shaped, silent, moved much faster then any aircraft, came almost to complete stop, then proceeded and vanished. I decided to go to the church and school of which I work, to lower the flag to ½ staff at midnight on 9/11/2015.  I did this so I wouldn’t have to get up so early since I work another job at night, and I wanted it up before everyone arrived in the morning.   As I was lowering the flag and looking up, something flew silently across the sky right above and slightly to the south from where I was standing moving from west to east.  I was facing south.  It was kind of horse shoe shaped, orange in color, and looked slightly like a sparkler.   Normally, I would have thought it was just a meteor however, it almost came to a complete stop, then went slightly further east, and then vanished.   It made me feel kind of creepy and I got the hell out of there.   That’s about it!  I’ve seen comets, meteors, and satellites all of my life but nothing that stopped and then proceeded on.;35.9285744680851;-86.8588223404257
