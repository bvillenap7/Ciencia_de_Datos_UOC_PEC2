Circling lights up in the sky  ((NUFORC Note:  Advertising light??  PD));2004-04-24 21:00:00;2 hours;Circling lights up in the sky There were 4 lights up in the sky circling a little ways from our house. Sometimes they would merge together and then they would break apart again. It went on for a long time, until we went to sleep. The sky was partly cloudy and we live in the country. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We suspect an advertising light may have been the cause of the sighting.  PD));35.9285744680851;-86.8588223404257
Fast moving noiseless object with three solid red lights shining at approximately -2.5 magitude.;2005-09-29 20:40:00;120 seconds;Fast moving noiseless object with three solid red lights shining at approximately -2.5 magitude. At approximately 9:40pm I step outside to check conditions when I noticed appoaching from the west-southwest was three solid red lights in a very tight V configuration. From the time I first notice the object, appoximately 40 degrees above the west-southwest horizon until I lost sight of the object when it was approximately 30 degrees above the east-norteast horizon 45 seconds had elapsed. The lights were a bright red and no sound that I could associate with the object was heard. The configuration of the lights were very much like those of an aircraft except the lights were a steady red in color and no sound was heard that I could associate with the object. Lights intensity did not vary as the object transversed the sky. Seeing condition were clear and bright. Object moved in straight line. Objects rate of motion and lack of sound give the impression of a satellite passing, but the red lights were approximately -2.5 magitude. I'm a amateur astronomer for over 40 years. Very familiar with the night sky. As a side note, we've had some unusal helicopter active tonight. Low flying, under 1000 ft., heavy lift type helicopter about an hour before the observation of the red lights.;35.9285744680851;-86.8588223404257
star sized object moving at jetliner speed, does a J-turn and doubles in speed before fading;2006-08-03 10:00:00;10 sec;star sized object moving at jetliner speed, does a J-turn and doubles in speed before fading late one night as i was stargazing on the hood of my car in a friends driveway, when i saw a moving star. i had been staring in the same general direction for about an hour or so when i noticed one of the stars was moving. at first i figured i had caught a glimpse of a passing satellite or a meteor. however it seemingly acted against my understanding of physics and logic. it was originally moving south to north at about the speed of a passing jetliner and  it was a solid white light about the brightness and size of an ordinary star. i followed it for about 10 seconds as i was curious as to what it was. while watching it i ruled out it being a shooting star from its speed and a jetliner due to its solid light when it suddenly did a J-turn and as it did so its speed doubled before it faded. due to its altitude and speed gathered from its  relation to the stars in the sky i've deduced that such a sudden change in velocity and direction would be at fatal levels to a human and disastrous to an aircraft of human design. the only explanation i can give is that it was far enough away from earths gravity to have the g-forces at tolerable levels. however, going off of this hypothesis would mean that its manipulation in zero gravity is equal to you or i kicking off the wall in a swimming pool.  as we all know, our understanding of space travel is very limited as we only know how to ride earths gravity and we cant actually change course without using up huge sums of fuel. secondly its size is really unknown. it had to be big enough to be seen by the naked eye  and appear the size of a star. it could be miles across for all we know. lastly the velocity change, this is the part that really rattles my brain. in less then a second its speed doubled and it continued to accelerate up until the point where it was no longer visible. it also covered great distances in that time. about 3 finger widths at arms length in a fraction of a second. I've ruled out planes, satellites, comets and meteors, and even! halluci nations as i was accompanied by a friend. this leaves only the things of fiction, either something man made that has been kept out of public knowledge or something made from an older, more intelligent species, who are probably here to try and stop us from killing ourselves and our beautiful planet. this has been a memory that will always remain at the front of my brain, i still think about it almost every day.  in fact it effectively changed me from a hopeful skeptic to a full fledged believer. in less then a second.;35.9285744680851;-86.8588223404257
Two unidentifiable red lights seen flying above Franklin, TN.;2008-11-01 19:00:00;5 Minutes;Two unidentifiable red lights seen flying above Franklin, TN. On the evening of Saturday, November 1st, in Franklin, TN a friend and I were standing in his backyard when I noticed a bright red light in the sky. It was twinkling and brighter than any of the surrounding stars.  I asked my friend if he thought it was Mars.  We watched it over the span of approximately 30 seconds before it began to fade away.  The light was stationary the entire time. Approximately one minute after the light had disappeared I noticed a second red light rising slowly through the trees.  The light appeared to be identical to the first, rose to approximately the same place in the sky, and remained stationary for one minute before fading away like the first light. We watched the sky for the next 15 minutes before going back inside.  In that time no other lights appeared.

Flickering lights moving quickly across the sky.;2017-03-17 21:00:00;5 minutes;Flickering lights moving quickly across the sky. Went outside to take a night walk and noticed it was starting to lightning and sprinkle.  We looked into the sky to see how frequent the lightning was and noticed a floating light moving across the sky from low in the south southwest horizon in a low arc and disappearing in the north northeast sky at about a 35 degrees above the horizon.   The light looked like a single flickering flame and was moving about like an airplane would fly, but there was no noise and they were just below the clouds.  After we noticed the first one, there were 6 more that came behind it, perfectly spaced apart in the same arc.;35.9285744680851;-86.8588223404257
Exited sun glint off of a satellite.;2020-04-17 19:20:00;3 minutes;Exited sun glint off of a satellite. Object appeared to be a satellite moving from southwest to northeast.  When object west about 60 degrees up from the horizon and west/northwest of my location, there was a bright light shining in my direction for about two seconds.  I am a military/commercial pilot retired after 41 years and over 12,000 hours of flying.  Probably half of my time is at night. The light looked like a sun glint.  Could it have been a brief sun reflection off of a satellite like the Hubble?  The angle to the sun below the horizon could explain it.  Except for the two second flash, the time of travel from overhead to the horizon was about one minute.;35.9285744680851;-86.8588223404257
