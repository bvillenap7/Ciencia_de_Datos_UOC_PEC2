Silent, red lights flying from horizon to horizon one after the other.;2015-04-28 20:10:00;15 minutes;Silent, red lights flying from horizon to horizon one after the other. While getting my new store ready, we were working late trying to get some shelving installed.  My wife took a break because we had a small argument over something silly.  She went outside to use her vaporizer.  She yelled for me to, Come quick, run!   When I got outside, she showed me two red lights in the sky.  They were flying by quickly and at low speed.   She managed to get a small video of them with her phone.  As they passed by and went over the tree line, in the same trajectory, another light would appear on the opposite side of horizon. flying the same path as the previous light.  No sound, looking just like a flare except it just kept flying right over our heads.   I don't know what I saw, it really doesn't make any sense.  The video my wife made looks horrible with all the zooming in and out.  She was trying to get background in the shot so people could reference altitude.  Then they just stopped appearing.   Like I said, just weird.;36.1228000000003;-88.5068999999992
