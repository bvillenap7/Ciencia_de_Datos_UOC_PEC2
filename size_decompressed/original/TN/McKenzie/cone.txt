I was standing on my front porch looking toward the north when I saw two glints moving along about 35 to 40 degrees above the horizon. I immediately ran into the hours and got a pair of 10 x 50 binoculars. Through the binoculars I could see that the objects were very shiny and shaped like a top, with the pointed portion down. They were moving at a steady rate of speed, but not especially fast. There were no signs of any sort of contrail or vapor coming from them.  My daughter, who was seven years old at the time, was outside and I hurriedly called her to come. I helped her hold the glasses and moved them around until she located the objects and her immediate comment confirmed my initial observation: They're tops, dad! she exlaimed. I watched these objects for three or four minutes until they faded from view. I would also note that shortly after I observed these objects, our pet dog--and every dog within earshot--began to howl and bark. I heard no sound whatsoever associated with the passages of these objects, although they were quite a distance away. I had the impression that they were perhaps two or three miles away at a minimum, which would have made them quite large. I should also note that I am a newspaper reporter and something of a trained observer and trained to give fairly accurate descriptions of events.;36.1228000000003;-88.5068999999992
