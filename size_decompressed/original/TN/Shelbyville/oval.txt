Object appeared to have a red glowing ring surrounded by a yellow ring. While sitting on the deck of a friend's home, my son, his friend, and I spotted a luminous blue oval-shaped object traveling from South to North at a high rate of speed.  Object was oval with a luminous blue appearance. It appeared to have a red ring changing to a fluorescent yellow as it faded from view.  It left a streak in the sky along it's path.;35.4830135593221;-86.4626745762713
fast moving ovals at night with unison in the sky;2010-10-05 10:41:00;90 seconds;fast moving ovals at night with unison in the sky outside on the property in which i live ,i was walking my two dogs,and i saw two oval white yellow objects evenly spaced above at about 11 oclock in the night sky moving at a rate of about 4 inches per second aproximate in my view observing it the objects were  traveling from a northeast to south eastern path of direction they were staying in perfect alignment with eachother then they appeared to spread apart in a v like formation moving faster than the original speed,and there was no noise at all they were slightly larger than stars and smaller than the moon in size about the size of a pencil lead i would compare them to.both objects were cutting a lateral line across the sky and went from horizion to horizion in less than 30 seconds i dont know of anything that could travel that fast,no beacon lights present,and the glow was dim but brighter than the stars it was odd. at the far extent of almost out of view i saw one cut to a sharp left turn very fast in a! very small area after changing direction. i have seen many times objects like thies,and they are not the only ones i've seen at night however they had to be very high up not in our atmosphere i would estimate the distance at maybe 200 or more miles up in the night sky. what is very strange is they were stationary and then moved and i just happened to see them ...........;35.4830135593221;-86.4626745762713
strange moving oval craft  running from other aircraft with a very erratic behavior at night..........;2010-10-08 19:37:00;19 minutes;strange moving oval craft  running from other aircraft with a very erratic behavior at night.......... in the night sky aproximately 19:37-18:00 hours i witnessed one craft traveling in the upward sky at 1 oclock to two oclock degree  angle moving southernly to northern path ,and the craft or object stopped and changed direction to its southern track again in an instant. i followed it with my cell phone camera which is a very good camera for a phone,and i'm not sure if i got it or not or whether it can be magnified by the reporting firm to show more,i'm hoping that can be done. the object stopped ,and i could not find it  i waited several minutes and i saw aircraft with blinking blue white red  strobing lights suddenly fill the area  in many directions i tried to take footage of that also. i saw it, the object again moving very slow from eastern to north western direction,and there was no change in the light sort of bright but not overly bright it had a strange look like haze or glare around it that did not distort the shape....very odd to me, and it would mo! ve erraticly  sort of darting from left to right  or mabey curving and sometimes  almost jumping around ,not stable at all. as i stated i saw other aircraft start flooding the area i counted i think 9 and the object making ten total,but i feel its very odd we are close to arnold airforce base in tullahoma tennessee. the other aircraft were also at a high altitudes because i could not hear any noise from any of them at all .i was able to film it ,but i dont know how good it is for proof? the object i feel was about the size aproximately 20 meters in size to be that visible at a clear night.maybe it was  several miles up if not more  the other craft could be military....unsure  but i have seen theis type of objects in the night sky before and some move very fast others are erratic in speed or very slow and or not moving at first the color they are is different than normal stars.very strange. its this kind of activity in the night sky that keeps you actively searching for unk! nown objects in the sky i am describing. i did the best i coul! d to be as accurate as possible  to describe direction behavior of the craft an incident as i could. not conventional aircraft,however the others were not moving as it was they were chasing it. and not  very close to it. it looked to me like the other aircraft were trying to box it in as it was moving away from them........;35.4830135593221;-86.4626745762713
