Erratic dim, and bright oval objects, moving across sky.;2012-06-29 21:37:00;20 minutes;erratic dim, and bright oval objects,moving across sky. i was in my bedroom,wife was gone i was watching tv, heard a loud thud like a head on collision i live in the countryside only a few houses nearby, ive moved from a area that had lots of houses around to an area secluded and few neighborsanyway i went outside after looking out windows saw nothing ,my two dogs were also up looking at back door?  i grabbed my 380 pistol that had a laser sight incorporated in the gun i was startled and i went out the backdoor looked around was quiet, look at neighbors house across street saw nothing lights out they were gone,so i just looked up at the shy dont know why and i saw one oval bluewhite bulb like craft moving slow it was making no sound,moon was about half full, and i would compare it to the size of a pinhead next to the size of the moon the size of a dime roughly,it was moving about a half inch a second,and i activated my laser sight and i pointed it at it and it stopped,and hesitated,and this is not an exaggeration at! all very serious,  it then speeded up to speed i noted first,there also were fixed star like blue,bright blue white ovals that all of a sudden started moving ive seen this before at my other residence,i have gotten into the habbit of looking i guess thats why i saw it happen, the two other crafts were moving about two to three inches per second on a ground sight scale with neckade eye, they were jumping swirling about in the sky close to each other no trails vapor,or again not any sound this lasted for about five minutes they moved from western to south towards the moon,and the lone bogie moved away at a streight line inbetween the two dancing objects,i was amazed because they just changed direction in a instant diagonal line changes i saw this happen before with 3-or 4 objects  a few years ago maybe 6 miles from  my new house  we bought they dim and brighten their light as they are streaking across,i looked saw no more got the idea to grab my night vision and go back out stood outside panning about til i saw one that i could not see o! nly it,u nless i view thru night vision it was like the others oval dim and was moving much slower about 1 inch per 2-3 seconds i watched it move about thirty feet ground to sky scale estimate,and it blurred out of range like it  moved away from the earth  til i could not see it anymore i kept refocusing my nightvision to get it in view,also saw  a round dark ball move over trees in my view after it went out of view ten feet per second no noise and i smelled something like burnt wire after it quickly streaked by it looked  like the size of a softball going over a treeline, weird but thats what happened going back out tonite to see if i see anything else?;35.4830135593221;-86.4626745762713
