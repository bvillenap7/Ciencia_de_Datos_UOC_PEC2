Cigar shaped craft - 30 years ago - technology still cannot be explained;1978-08-15 21:00:00;2 min;Cigar shaped craft - 30 years ago - technology still cannot be explained I was 16 years old and sleeping over at a friend's house.  I was lying in bed looking out the window just trying to get to sleep when I spotted a cigar shaped object with lights hovering maybe 1/2 mile away (Southeast Lawrenceburg, TN).   I watched the object for about 5 seconds before it registered what I may be looking at.  I woke my friend yelling, get up if you want to see a ufo.   He got up, came to the window, and we watched for another few seconds before running out of the room and yelling for his sister to wake up and come outside.   When the three of us got outside, the object was still hovering, motionless, in the distance.  It was close enough that all the lights were clearly visible and a metallic shine came from the surface of the craft.  We watched as it sat perfectly still for another 20-30 seconds.   Suddenly, the craft took off, flew over our heads and toward the opposite horizon.  About halfway before getting to the other horizon, it immediately took a sharp 90 degree turn right, flew about a mile, and took another 90 degree turn left.  It then flew at an amazing speed before disappearing over the horizon.   From the time that it took off until it was completely gone from sight over the opposite horizon was only about 6-8 seconds.  Although at one point it was directly above us and no more than 300 yards away, we never heard a sound. I am a 45 year old mechanical engineer.  With years of study in physics, engineering, and study of the most up-to-date technology, I have never encountered anything that would explain the capabilities that this craft had. If I live to be 100, I'll remeber it like it happened just last night. ((NUFORC Note  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));35.2507;-87.3526000000001
