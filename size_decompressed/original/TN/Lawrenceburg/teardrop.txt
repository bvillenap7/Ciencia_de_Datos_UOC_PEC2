At 20:00 on 2 july 2012 I was inn my parents back yard shooting fireworks.   I looked up in the sky and saw a movement, so I focused my view on the movement and saw a teardrop craft with dull lights around the perimeter. It was about a 1500 to 2500 ft above me and silent.  It moved from west to east in a straight line.   It lasted for approximately 2-3 seconds then suddenly just disappeared like a ship from star treck cloaking.  I had the impression that it knew I had seen it so it cloaked to prevent me from seeing it.  It was about the size of 3 golf balls.  That was my first viewing of a UFO.   I was sober and in sound mind and I attest this report to be the full truth. ((name deleted));35.2507;-87.3526000000001
