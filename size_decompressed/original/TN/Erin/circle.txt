It only makes this sound when a cell phone is around it.  So I got up to get my cell phone and it was turned off so I got back on the bed when I turn my head to the window and it was round with like 20 to 30 lights around it.  My girlfriend rose up to me screaming “look out the window you see that” so I ran outside to see a better close up and there it was in a distance but this time it was only a bright light instead of a lot of them.  Me and my girlfriend and her dad were outside watching it for about 10 seconds and then it was gone.  It made a humming nose and I never seen an aircraft like this.  Believe or not.;36.3073;-87.6772
