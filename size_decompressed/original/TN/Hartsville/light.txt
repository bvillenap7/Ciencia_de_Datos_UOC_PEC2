bright light hoovers over tennessee ski....;2001-02-25 16:00:00;currently  happening;bright light hoovers over tennessee ski.... we are currently watching a very bright light in our shies that appears to be hoovering at times and then moving at extremely slow speeds...at the same time we are observing aircraft in the area and this is definitely not a aircraft...the dogs are howling constantly and even the cats are acting strange...  My friend ((name deleted)) who has lived here for years has never seen anything quite like this...We are taking photos of the light but am unsure of how they are going to turn out...currently the craft has now dissappeared so the event lasted  about 20 minutes...This is definitely a very odd and strange eventâ€¦ ((NUFORC note:  We do not know what they are observing, but we would first address the possibility of Venus, which might be visible at 4:00 p.m. on a clear day.  That is only a guess.  PD));36.397;-86.1707
