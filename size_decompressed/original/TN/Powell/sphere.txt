Large orbs seen over toxic waste dump site in Powell, TN.;2017-01-29 20:00:00;20 minutes;Large orbs seen over toxic waste dump site in Powell, TN. 50' diameter light colored orbs moved in circles as well as rose and went down behind the ridge line.  The area they were over is near I-75 where there is an old chemical waste dump site near Dante Rd. and Central Ave.  We drove around the area to try and locate a source, none were found.  The car radio signal was broken up, and cleared up as we left the area.  Some remained still as others moved about in a very clear area over the ridge,there was no sound noticed,at one point a single object appeared for a very short time 20 to 30 seconds.  A larger round red object with white lights ringing the edge appeared several hundred feet to the north, it disappeared as quickly as it had appeared, it did not move during the time it was seen and appeared to be the same size as the others with a different shape do to the ring of white lights which gave it a saucer type appearance.  The night was clear and the objects were in plain sight and very clear in definition;36.045;-84.0396
