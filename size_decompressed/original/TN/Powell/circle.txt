White starlike UFO over Powell.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of the star, Sirius??  PD))((anonymous report));2017-03-04 22:31:00;Ongoing;White starlike UFO over Powell Me and about 5 other people were on our back porch at about 10 at night when we noticed what looked like a star in the sky.  We noticed that it wasn't there yesterday and stars don't just appear out of nowhere so we decided to use our phones to get a closer look.  On our cells we noticed that it appeared to be spinning and it was moving slightly, we couldn't tell if it was going up or just further away from us.  It's been here for about 30 minutes and we've gotten pretty decent pictures of it.  There was just one, and later we noticed what seemed to be a plane going towards it but we couldn't really see that well.
