star like object blinking red, green, and white, mostly stationary then moving away   ((NUFORC Note:  Venus, or twinkling star??  PD));2007-10-03 02:30:00;1-2 hours;star like object blinking red, green, and white, mostly stationary then moving away At about 1:30 am, we awoke to the sounds of dogs barking, cows mooing, and our cat meowing. As we are retired it is not unusual for us to get up for a couple of hours, sit out and watch the stars. My wife saw one that appeared to move. I told her it was a star, but she was sure it was moving, and had blinking lights on it. I got my binoculars and looked at it. It was hard to tell if it was moving, but then when I saw an electric line in my foreground, and sitting in the same position I could tell it was moving very slowly. It was pretty far off but I could distinguish red, green, and white lights that blinked. I watched it for about 20 minutes, until I couldn’t see the blinking lights. It appeared to be moving southeast, away from us. We didn’t here any sound from it at any time, and it was just too far away to make out a distinct shape. I might mention it appeared to be very high in altitude. We went back to bed around 2:30 and it was still visible, but barely. I awoke again at 4:30 and it was no longer there.
