Bedroom invader, forced to flee.;2004-08-13 01:30:00;1 minute;Bedroom invader, forced to flee. I am a UFO researcher, and have seen several UFOs myself.  However, this is not a UFO report as such, but a humanoid sighting instead. As I stated above, it was approx. 01:30 hrs. on a Fri. night in August.  I was in bed with my wife trying to go to sleep, having only been 5 or so minutes after turning out the light.  I was fully awake, I am a trained soldier, I know the difference, seeing as penalties are stiff if you fall asleep on watch.  I suddenly felt a presence on my right side,and heard some whispering to me, and looked over to see a grey.  At first I thought the whispering was my son, however upon answering, and looking to my right, I saw the entity.  I do not believe in the ETH, and being a christian I recognized it for the demon it was, and rebuked it in Jesus' name and it immediately left. I realize that you don't believe this way, therefore you will most likely ignore this report.  However, it is the truth, and my wife, whom I woke, can attest to it.
