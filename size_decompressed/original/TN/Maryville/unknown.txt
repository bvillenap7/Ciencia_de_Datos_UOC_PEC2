I was outside around 9:30 p.m. last night and I started to hear something that sounded like a plane, which I thought was strange since I never hear planes out at my house.  Then I realized the humming noise wasn't at a consistent level. It was almost in waves. So I am looking above me for this weird plane, and right when I give up I just happen to look out on the horizon and there it was!  At first, yes it looked like a plane, but then I noticed there were red and white lights (too many for a plane or satellite) in somewhat of a row, blinking in (once again) inconsistent patterns. So I watch the large figure in the sky as it was going in all directions, at different speeds, hovering around the same area.  Then it made a weird zig-zag descent behind the tree line.   All of this happened within about two minutes.;35.6926551666658;-84.0665199333266
