It was a partly cloudy night with the moon shining through the clouds.  As I was walking I noticed out of the corner of my eye a blue light aprox 1000 ft in the sky moving very rapidly to the north east I have worked in avation for 15 years and I live on final approach to mcgee tyson airport and this was no aircraft it made no noise and I was waiting for an explosion because it looked like it was a missle or something.  This made the local news but the explanation was never discovered.  Several other people reported this event and may have seen it better than me.;35.6926551666658;-84.0665199333266
A bright light moving away and disappeared;2009-02-02 07:30:00;1 minute;A bright light moving away and disappeared My brother and I was outside cooking on the grill, and i looked up in the sky and seen an abnormally bright light. I asked my brother if he had seen it, and he said yes, absolutley. The light was brighter than the north star and was getting brighter. It was also moving to the left and away from us. It slowly got dimmer and eventually disappeared. It looked as if a ship from a movie was taking off into light speed. This was a very convincing moment for me that there is something else out there.;35.6926551666658;-84.0665199333266
Bright white dot hovers in sky, quickly drops down, then shoots up and disappears leaving a copper streak;2009-04-17 06:22:00;10 seconds;Bright white dot hovers in sky, quickly drops down, then shoots up and disappears leaving a copper streak Driving to work in Maryville, TN, I pass through the mountains.  The sky is always filled with stars and I observe them as I drive.  My manufacturing business is very close to an airport so when I saw the object which appeared as a very bright single dot, I assumed it was an airplane.  However, the bright white dot never moved.  The dot seemed to hover in place and then suddenly the dot appeared to fall downward then, as fast as it fell, it shot straight up and disappeared leaving a copper streak in the sky. I immediately called my husband whom was also on his way to work. He was in Knoxville, TN which is 30 minutes from Maryville. I proceeded to tell him about what I had seen. Shockingly, he was just as surprised as I was and told me he saw it too! He described the exact details as I have provided above.;35.6926551666658;-84.0665199333266
