Strange diamond shaped light sits in sky, then begins to move;2020-08-04 22:40:00;5+ min;Strange diamond shaped light sits in sky, then begins to move We saw a bright light, almost like it was something with 4 bright LED lights, in the sky. It wasn't moving, and so I figured it wasn't a star, and wasn't likely an airplane just sitting there like that, so I went to go get the camera and my son followed me outside. It looked like a diamond. The bottom 3 lights were so close together you couldn't really see where one began and the other ended. The light on top was just slightly enough separated from the rest so you could see it was an individual light. I take a picture and I'm looking at it through my screen when I noticed it started moving. It then looked as if it dimmed it's lights and started blinking. I could swear it was blinking red with the white as it slowly began moving to the left. I panicked and got my kids back inside at that point. That was like nothing I've ever seen before in the sky. And I sit there staring at the starts every night. When we came back inside my 4 year old tells my husband, &qu! otDaddy we saw a Diamond in the sky. I hadn't even had the chance to say that's what I thought it looked like. So we were definitely seeing the same thing.;35.6926551666658;-84.0665199333266
