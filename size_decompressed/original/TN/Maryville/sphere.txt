Strange hovering ball of light that floated over Maryville TN on 12/16/2005 at 8 p.m.;2005-12-16 08:00:00;10 minutes;Strange hovering ball of light that floated over Maryville TN on 12/16/2005 at 8 p.m. I stared at a white ball of light that looked like a street light in the sky. The sky was cloudy with no other stars in the sky. I witnessed other people driving by looking at it.  The ball of light seemed to hover in one spot and moved a short distance across the sky then returned to its original position. I called my brother on my cell phone then suddenly it went out like someone turning off light bulb. I could still see it when it was out, then it disappeared.;35.6926551666658;-84.0665199333266

Aircraft taking-off seen trailed by two unidentified object / vehicles;2021-06-15 23:00:00;1 minute;Aircraft taking-off seen trailed by two unidentified object / vehicles I was sky-watching while sitting on my backyard deck (I like looking for satellites or watching aircraft from nearby McGhee Tyson Airport). I have a pair of binoculars that I use during this endeavor.  On the night of June 15th, 2021, I saw an aircraft taking-off around 2300 hours. It was traveling in an easterly direction, and was about 45 degrees above the horizon, when I focused my binoculars on it. At this time I saw two lights, which looked like what you would expect when seeing satellites, traveling above, and in the same direction as, the aircraft. I then saw each light bank-away from each other, and take-up a position behind the aircraft. It looked like a classic fighter maneuver to get behind an adversary aircraft. The lights tailed the aircraft (closely, but not close enough to be a hazard) for a short distance before they both climbed upward at a steep angle. I lost sight of the lights before losing sight of the aircraft.  Other than the engine noise from the aircraft, no unusual sound was heard. They lights were a solid, white color. They had no other lights that were visible to me (such as collision or navigation lights as should be seen on an aircraft). I do not think they were drones, at least in the conventional/non-military sense owing to their speed and maneuverability.  I should also mention that I have good knowledge of aviation and aircraft.;35.6926551666658;-84.0665199333266
