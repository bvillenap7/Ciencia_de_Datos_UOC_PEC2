Silver, cigar shaped object north of downtown Maryville, TN in or around 1991;1991-10-01 18:00:00;5 minutes;Silver, cigar shaped object north of downtown Maryville, TN in or around 1991 Travelling home with my grandmother through the downtown area of Maryville, TN, I remember looking out of the window near sundown and seeing a silver, cigar shaped object moving through the clouds in a westerly direction.  It definitely had a solid form to it and reflected the sunlight slightly with the clouds around having a orangish sunset coloration while the object was silver but did reflect some tinge of the same orangish color.  It moved in and out of the clouds very slowly.  It is a very distinct memory in my mind.  I cannot remember exactly how long it was there but definitely seemed fairly large due to the distance away and was definitely not a blimp to my recollection.  I also cannot remember it leaving the area specifically and I do not believe my grandmother spotted it as I cannot remember talking with her specifically about it.

I noticed what I thought was a plane, until I realized it had no wings, and was completely silent.  It was moving slowly, in a straight line, from SW to NE, toward Knoxville.   As soon as I lost sight of it, I saw a second, then a third.  Same height, same direction, same flight path.  All 3 moved very slowly, and made no sound. They were cigar-shaped, bright white in color, and seemed to be in 2 sections.  The leading end was about 2/3 of the total length, with front and back divided by a slightly darker band.;35.6926551666658;-84.0665199333266
