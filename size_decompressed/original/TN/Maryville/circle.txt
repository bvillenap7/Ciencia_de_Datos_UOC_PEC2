UFO or something of the sorts, spotted in east TN;2019-01-10 01:14:00;30+ minutes;ufo or something of the sorts, spotted in east TN i went outside for a smoke at about 1am, it was cold so i sat in my car and went to crack the window. when i looked out the window,  i noticed a super bright “star” in the SE direction .. stars aren’t that bright are they? they’re not that big either. they definitely don’t change size and color, right?  it seemed to be getting brighter and bigger so i pulled my phone out to record. i zoomed in, spotted the light, and saw that this star-like form was now a giant glowing ball that looked like something off of freakin jimmy neutron.  it was a defined circle, glowing white on the outside but a staticky and colorful orb on the inside.  i’m still not sure of exactly what i saw that night,  i got scared and went inside. 30 minutes of the experiencing unknown was enough for me.  i have continued to try and put the thought out of my mind, but at this point i know that  there is something bigger than us  out there and i need answers;35.6926551666658;-84.0665199333266
