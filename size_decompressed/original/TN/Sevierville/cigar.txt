Driver noticed a circular shaped, shiny object in the sky and asked the another passenger and I if we see the object. We looked and we did in fact see a shiny object in the shape of a circle.  The driver and I (sitting in the middle) noticed the circle change from a circle to a cigar shape. The third passenger did not as he looked down at his phone.  I then looked down at my phone and the other passenger along with the driver watched as the object that was then a cigar shape, disappear.  The sky's we're blue and clear.  The wierd thing is this object had no trail of any kind around it, giving at least a direction.;35.8513160714288;-83.525045918367
