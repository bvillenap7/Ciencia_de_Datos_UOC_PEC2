A ufo hovers over my tree line in recent months and I have watched it do a dance per say zigzaging then just hover behind tree lines;2017-03-29 23:30:00;15 minutes;A ufo hovers over my tree line in recent months and I have watched it do a dance per say zigzaging then just hover behind tree lines I have been seeing this ufo in my area for several months.  It zigzags back in forth on the south side of my house in a distance.  The lights are visible, it hovers for several minutes, as well, but does not remain still.  This evening it was heading towards another flying object.  I think it was crossing paths with an airplaine.  It was like it was trying to do a head on when it saw the plaine and began heading in the direction the plaine was coming.  They horizontally passed by each other and the plaine left and the ufo remained from 23:31pm untill current when it hovered, decending behind the tree line and out of my sight but still huvering none the less.  It is now 23:45pm.   I have seen this ufo cloak itself in broad daylight as I watched the light I was watching do the same discription as above but all you can see is light, no craft.  It zigzags and hovers for serveral minutes, then falls behind treelines, not gone but out of my vantage point.
