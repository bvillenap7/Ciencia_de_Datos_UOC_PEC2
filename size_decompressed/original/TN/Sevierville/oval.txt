I went to my car to get something.I looked at the moon,it was a clear night and it was just a little slice of moon showing so you could see the dark side.When I went to turn towards the car,my eyes caught the object.It was night time so it was really clear.It was an oval shaped cluster of bright lights.It was flying really low and seemed slow,but it didn't take long to disappear.It was flying west,north-west.I took my compass outside to see.When it got pretty far away,I noticed that it banked right,towards the north.I then lost sight of the object.I wasn't the only one to see this object.I called out my wife and my 9 yr old son to witness this.I've seen strange lights here before,but,we just brushed them off as having a strong imagination.This time is different!We saw it very,very,clear!There is no doubt in my mind about it.I called airports,news rooms,police...no one knew anything.I like to consider myself a rational person.I don't drink or do drugs.I'm a hard worker.I'm family oriented.I don't want any sort of publicity or attention.I would like to see pics fitting that description tho.Also,shortly after,an airplane was flying quite rapidly in the same direction.;35.8513160714288;-83.525045918367

But as I watched, I began to note out of the norm characteristics.  Mint green color, deliberate trajectory, slower movement than a shooting star and no trail.;35.8513160714288;-83.525045918367
