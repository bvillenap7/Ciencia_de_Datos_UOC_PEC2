Strange orange fireball over Sevierville TN, just vanishes.;2012-07-29 02:47:00;30-45 seconds;Strange orange fireball over Sevierville TN, just vanishes. I was outside stargazing at about 2:45am.  I then noticed an orange colored ball of light in the northwest, flying southeast.  The light traveled across the sky, about 50 degrees above the horizon, for approximately 30-45 seconds before literally just disappearing. There were no clouds that could have hidden the object.   At first I thought it could have just been a helicopter or an airplane, since the airport is just a few miles away.  But it had no strobe lights, and again just vanished.;35.8513160714288;-83.525045918367
Saw an object with a huge tail of fire traveling West to east at a very high rate of speed.;2019-04-04 07:00:00;14 seconds;Saw an object with a huge tail of fire traveling West to East at a very high rate of speed. At approximately 6:55 am, April 4, 2019, I was traveling south on Rt 66, coming from I-40 exit 407 in Sevierville, TN, going to work in Pigeon Forge, TN.  To my right, I saw an object traveling at an extremely high rate of speed (50 times faster than any jet in the sky) traveling from my right to my left, West to east.  It looked as if something had entered the earth's atmosphere and was burning.  However, I did not have any depth benchmark and couldn't tell how high it was.  It actually looked like it was going to land at the Sevierville airport.  The object quickly disappeared to my left.  It did not loose altitude.  The rate of speed made me feel the object was close.  I could not distinguish a shape but whatever it was, it was diminished by the large tail of fire behind it.;35.8513160714288;-83.525045918367
