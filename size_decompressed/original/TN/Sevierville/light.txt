Held;2019-07-03 23:00:00;1 minute;Entered quickly from East, decelerated rapidly. Fixed in place, displayed a number of light flashing patterns, red and green/blue. Held red for last part of display, accelerated north rapidly and emitted white light while doing so. Acceleration/deceleration was too rapid to be manned. We thought it might be a drone at first, but too fast even for that. No visible stabilization. When it was steady, it was rick solid. When it moved, it was rapid acceleration.weird, wouldn’t be reporting this if we didn’t think it was unusual.
