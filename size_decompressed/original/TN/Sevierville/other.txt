UFO seen in the night sky.;2008-01-12 19:45:00;1 minute;UFO seen in the night sky. While driving down the road at approximately 7:45 pm, we spotted an object about 20 feet above our vehicle.  The object was no certain form or shape, almost like a blob with no lights and absolutely no noise.  It moved very slowly, almost like it was gliding above us.  The passenger stuck her head out of the window to try to view the object as it moved over the vehicle.  Within seconds, the object was gone and we could no longer find it.;35.8513160714288;-83.525045918367
