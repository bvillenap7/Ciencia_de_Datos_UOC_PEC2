It resembled an airplane, but was not moving up, down, or side to side.  The lights were changing from red, blue, green, and possibly white or yellow.  The object was unlike any other thing that was in the night sky.  I looked at it through binoculars and it was still a speck in the sky, but the colors were very clear using the binoculars.  I am a police officer and work night shift and I have never seen anything like this before and I really am not a UFO believer, but this was something that I can not explain.  Also, I observed what appeared to be a similar object on the same date at 0545 hours, just before I got off of my shift, in Pigeon Forge, TN in the south eastern sky and several other Officers saw it as well.  My Sergeant said that it was a planet and that the atmosphere was making it change colors, but I have never seen a planet do that.;35.8513160714288;-83.525045918367
Brillant round craft that hoovered in the morning sky in Tennessee...;2001-10-31 08:25:00;35seconds;Brillant round craft that hoovered in the morning sky in Tennessee... I was driving my 14 year old son to school, in Chestnut Hill Tennessee, we were on Old Newport Highway. I Was driving about 50MPH when I noticed a brillant, shiny, metallic object in the Eastern sky. I was stunned because I knew that it was not an airplane, nor was it a helicopter because it did not move. It Was hovering. I told my son to look at it and he was as shocked as I was. It was about the height that a helicopter would fly, but it was definitely not a helicopter. It then shot up at an 11:00 o clock angle and was out of the atmosphere in a matter of micro-seconds. My mother was in the back seat of the car and leaned over the seat and saw it as well. I work at a business in Gatlinburg, Tn. and am very conservative. I have a college education, and I have NEVER encountered anything like this before. I knew when I looked up at it what it was...it was an incredible experience.. Thank you;35.8513160714288;-83.525045918367
