We saw eight triangle shaped ships and felt wind off the first four but heard nothing.;2002-05-30 22:30:00;5 minutes;We saw eight triangle shaped ships and felt wind off the first four but heard nothing. I went outside with my two friends cause we were getting done watching Tough Enough. It was about ten thirty when I went outside and saw what looked like a silent fireworks show. 4 white, triangle shaped objects were seen flying LOW over my house. Shortly after that, 4 more of these objects flew past high overhead. We felt the wind off the first four but heard absolutely nothing. Sort of like a zone of silence. One of my friends fell ill later but that is of little relevance. My radio also went haywire.;35.8513160714288;-83.525045918367
Three lights in triangle shape hoover over houses, makes no sounds and flees as we begin to investigate;2005-02-28 22:15:00;1-5 minutes;Three lights in triangle shape hoover over houses, makes no sounds and flees as we begin to investigate My father and myself were traveling home from work on February 28, 2005 at approximately  10:15 P.M. We had just made a left turn on Boydes Creek Road heading east toward Servierville TN, when I first noticed a strange, very large, little in the sky a mile or so ahead. At first I only glazed at it and did not mention anything to my father. As we got closer to the object I saw the there were three individual lights with no pulse and it was completely motionless. It was at that point that I asked my father what he thought it was. He immediately anwsered, It's a plane, but as he looked closer he too noticed the lack of flashing lights and its stationary position. At this time we could both see that the three lights were in a triangle formation, but could see nothing of a vessel. The light were only about 100 yards to our left and no more than 100 feet in altitude. My father then began to slow down in the middle of the highway, and as we came to an almost complete stop the object began to move away from us in a norhtwest direction almost like it knew we were looking(spooky). As we came to a full stop I already had begun to exit the vehicle when I immediately noticed no sound. My father and I both stood outside the car for about 30 seconds as we watched it fly away and never heard any sound except for those of nature. The objects speed and movment was unlike anything either of us had ever seen. It seemed to go from a dead stop to an estimated 100 mph instantly, and then continued at that same velosity until we had to return to our vehicle. After we began to drive away my father called a co-worker who was in the car ahead of us. He to saw the lights with no flash and not moveing. He did not, however, stop or see it move.;35.8513160714288;-83.525045918367
Triangular shaped crafted flew over top of us.;2013-02-10 19:10:00;1-2 minutes;Triangular shaped crafted flew over top of us. Need to file a correction on a report filed previously. The date was the 10th of February. I believe I reported the sighting to be on the 24th.  I had family plans on the 24th but the correct date was the 10th. I remember this correctly because we hiked to Abrams Falls earlier that day at Cade's Cove.;35.8513160714288;-83.525045918367
A Triangle object.;2014-03-20 21:28:00;3 minutes;A Triangle object I was outside smoking and heard what I thought was a low flying plane.  I saw 2 orange lights on the side and a red light on the bottom.  I went inside and told my partner to come look at this (hes in the air force so I thought he might know what type of plane it was).  When it got closer, it was a perfect triangle with 3 orange lights and a red light on the bottom of it.  It was moving very slow and then it flew behind a tree and we lost sight of it.  We went into the yard to keep watching it, but it was already gone.;35.8513160714288;-83.525045918367
Triangle visible with Night Vision only.;2019-11-25 23:00:00;30 minutes;Triangle visible with Night Vision only. Wife and I was using 3rd Gen military night vision to see additional stars not visible with eye. Posting now but this was late November 2019.  Noticed three large lights in northern sky making perfect triangle.  Perfect triangle and very large in sky.  Went inside to use Google sky to identify objects.  Nothing matched the program like the triangle shape being natural.  Not visible to the naked eye.  Plain as day with 3rd gen night vision.  Shape was gone when I came back out approx 25 min later.  I like using the night vision because there is so much more to see. I just discovered this site thanks to FOX News.  Thank you.;35.8513160714288;-83.525045918367
