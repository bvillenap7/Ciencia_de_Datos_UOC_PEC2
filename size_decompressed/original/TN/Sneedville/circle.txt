Exactly 21:40 pm my dad and I turned around and saw a brighter than normal light and larger than any star in the sky about 10 O’clock position in the western sky. Staring at it for approximately 5-10 seconds trying to figure out what it was it seemed to have tilted or rotated in a way that made the intensity of the light dimmer. Then it just started moving away from us and kind of upward at the same time. It took approximately a minute to a minute and a half for it to totally disappear. Right about the last thirty seconds before we couldn’t see it any more it moved to the right what looked like an inch on the black background.  Never seen anything like it in my life and we just kept staring at the last place we saw it asking each other what the heck was that?;36.5277;-83.2572
