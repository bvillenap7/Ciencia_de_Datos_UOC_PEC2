From underneath it appeared to be triangular with lights around the base with a vapor trail behind. I was getting ready to go to bed. I was checking the doors and turning the lights out when I noticed a bright star in the north/northeast lower sky. It looked too large to be a star and assumed at first that maybe it was an airplane. However, it did not appear to be moving. I didn't pay too much attention to it until I decided to get my telescope to look at it closer. But my telescope was too high to look at it through my front windows, so I took it off the tripod. It took a little while as the lights were off. When I looked back up the object was gone. I went to the doorway at the east side of the house and saw the object from underneath. I then realised that the object was triangular in shape with lights around the base and a trail, like that of a comet, at the rear. I could only see it from the door for a short time as there is a roof that obstructed the view. I moved to the back of the house to once again see it. I then went to wake my husband to have him see it. I thought that it may have been the space shuttle, but didn't think it would be flying that low. It did not deviate from the direction it was flying and it took at least 10 to 15 minutes from the time I first saw it until it was out of view. It flew in a north/northeast to south/southwest direction.;35.919;-86.1834
