Low Flying UFO Over Roan Mountain ,Tennessee Changes Colors as it Returns a Greeting From Motorist!;2008-01-15 08:56:00;4: Min.;Low Flying UFO Over Roan Mountain ,Tennessee Changes Colors as it Returns a Greeting From Motorist! While traveling south on US.143 one mile north of PISGAH National Forrest I thought I was observing a very low flying plane, with all landing lights on,(although I thought 16 white landing lights was a bit much)and I thought he might be having trouble since we are a good 20 miles to the nearest landing strip,Then I thought maybe,he just wants to be seen,or even a hoaxer with all that extra light. I did something on the spur of the moment and flashed my Jeeps Headlights on and off several times, What happened next is very odd for this place, and something I've never seen before on any aircraft. Those sixteen lights that were shining straight down were nt strobing at all,then the instant I flashed my lights at him ALL SIXTEEN LIGHTS TURNED BRIGHT RED FLASHED ON AND OFF THE SAME AS ME THEN REMAINED RED!! true I know It's not a Travis Walton Story,but, It's Mine and It's True they were'nt trying to hide at all. Hope to see them again.;36.1738;-82.0787
