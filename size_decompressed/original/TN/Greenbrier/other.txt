Star moving in odd directions;2019-10-19 07:30:00;ongoing;Star moving in odd directions I was outside and was looking up at the stars, as it was very clear.  I suddenly almost overhead noticed a medium bright star and focused on it for a few seconds.  Suddenly it started moving to the right, at a slow speed, then stopped and came back to the previous position.  Made other movements in different directions, at quick and slow speeds.  At this time of night, it is a little to the northwest from being directly overhead of where we are standing. I told my daughter to look at it and see if it looked like it was moving to her. As we both watched it, it moved in a circular motion, stopped, then rather quickly moved to the left and came back to original position. I have looked most every night and it still does these crazy maneuvers, always in circles, diagonal, or right and left patterns, and it stays within a certain area. I have tried to figure if it's just me, but the fact that we've both seen it and watched it for several minutes is strange.;36.4198;-86.7946
