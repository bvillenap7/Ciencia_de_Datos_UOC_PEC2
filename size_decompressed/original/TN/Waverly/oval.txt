The shape appear's oval with red or red/orange and yellow lights.. Its very very visible.  It appears to be bobbing very fast and dancing although it stays in one area.  It may be an optical illusion the way the strobe lights are flashing tho.  Its some kind of craft.  Not a Typical Helicopter hover..  Its hard to look at too.  It seems to be either vibrating or moving but staying in one area..  It is not hovering over my Town Waverly, Tennessee..  It is way off hovering EAST over somewhere else but I see it clearly ..Call Anytime 931-((telephone number deleted));36.0984;-87.7975
