Intense light in the sky coming in and out of view changing from green to white for 30 minutes.;2008-11-09 18:20:00;30 min;Intense light in the sky coming in and out of view changing from green to white for 30 minutes. I was working in my garage and was heading across the yard when I looked up to see what at first I thought was a really bright star. My daughter (16) and I stop to look at it when we realized it seemed to be moving. It was some distance off to the west and would only periodically move up and down and sometimes to the north. It would move in a sudden motion and stop as quick as it would start. At this point my wife and other two children came outside to look at it. The light would get extremely intense and fade sometimes turning an extremely bright green. This was much brighter than any landing light I have ever seen. At one point it seemed to move to the west at an extreme rate and disappeared in about 1 second. After about 30 seconds it reappeared even brighter than the first time and would occasionally seem to project a light straight forward. The characteristics were not that of a landing light or search light on an aircraft. There is a small airport near my home and I'm use to seeing landing lights on a daily basis. We watched this object come in and out of view several times over the course of 30 minutes and at no time did the maneuvers our intensity of the lights make any sense. I have never seen an aircraft that could maneuver in this fashion. If I had to guess at approximately where the object was I would have to say close to the T.V.A. coal power plant in New Johnsonville about 6-7 air miles from my house. The object left to the west and what seemed to be upward and then it was gone.;36.0984;-87.7975
