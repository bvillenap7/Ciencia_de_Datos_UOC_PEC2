Fifty feet away,size of basketball orange and darting in trees.;2013-06-08 20:00:00;3.00 minutes;Fifty feet away,size of basketball orange and darting in trees. I thought this was the size of a volley ball to basketball.It was darting up and down and around large trees.It was no more than 50 feet away at any time.It seemed to move in straight lines then stop.  No noise at all.  The color seemed between white light and orange.In the third photo there are 2, the bottom one appeared blueish in color.  In the fourth photo notice the thick white smoke or cloud.In the first photo notice how the object is curvy.;36.0984;-87.7975
