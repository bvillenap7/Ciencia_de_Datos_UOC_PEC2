We got our binoculars and looked through them and the craft is oval shape, has red, white and blue lights on it that flash off and on.  Sometimes the lights do not flash.  It will stay in one place for about 10 minutes and then move just a little bit and start flashing lights.  On 2/12/02 it stayed for 15 minutes and left but this morning it has stayed already 30 minutes.  Never have seen this before.;35.4586;-86.7830000000001
