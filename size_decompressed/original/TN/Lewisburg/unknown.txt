Like a grouping of balloons with a slight glow to them;2005-10-10 21:00:00;4 minutes;Went to a drive in movie with my husband, teenage daughter and two other couples.  About an hour into the movie I was looking at the clear star filled night when I saw directly above me what I will describe like a grouping of balloons with a slight glow to them.  It was moving due east about as high as a helicopter but no noise.  I pointed it out to my daughter and then to my husband and to make sure we were not seeing things our friends who were sitting in the back bed of their pickups like us.  I say about five more went by the length was big maybe like a airplane lentgth with what  I would describe as a tail having two of the glowing roundish objects trailing behind.  It was amazing.  I didnt know I could post this sighting so I am now even though it's been a year, there is no doubt as to it being what it is.

A Large white light appearing to come out of the atmosphere and changing directions.;2013-02-14 22:24:00;3-5 seconds;A Large white light appearing to come out of the atmosphere and changing directions. I was driving South on US431 at approximately 10:24p.m. between Petersburg and Belfast in Marshall County, Tennessee.  A large white light came directly straight down from the sky appearing to come out of the atmosphere.  At first I leaned forward in the seat as I was watching this out of the windshield of the car while driving, and at first I thought it was just a shooting star.  Then it came to a complete stop for approximately 1/2 second to 1 second changing directions traveling directly South and was out of sight within another second.  The entire event only lasted 3-5 seconds. Also after the event was over I thought about what I observed just a few months ago.  I saw a shooting star no more than 6 months ago driving East on SR373 in Marshall County as well and the size or the brightness had no comparison to what I saw tonight.  The white light was so bright I can only compare it to a spot light but it didn't have the blinding effect, it was so beautiful.  The size of the white light appeared to be about 100 times larger than the size of a star you would see in the evening sky or a blinking light from a commercial aircraft. I listed the shape as unknown but just like looking at any light or a star it appeared to be sphere shaped. Reported by: Law Enforcement Officer;35.4586;-86.7830000000001
