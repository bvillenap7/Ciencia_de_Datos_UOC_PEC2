It was dark outside and I had been playing hockey. I started to get the feeling that I was being watched, it creeped me out, and I went and sat down to the side of the parking lot I was in. After a few minutes of sitting down, I began to hear a few dogs barking quite a bit. I eventually got up and left, and started to head home. I live right below the top of a rather large hill, and there is an intersection at the top of the hill. I got to the top of the hill, and non-voluntarily, I looked up to see this bright star-shaped object in the sky. It was the color of a star at first, and it streaked directly across the sky quickly and gracefully. It streaked for a few seconds, and it began to emanate red and green for a second or two, and it disappeared. It almost seemed like it was crashing when the red and green appeared. This was the only object I saw, and it was shaped almost exactly like a star but it seemed too unnatural. I heard the sound of a plane afterwards.;35.4586;-86.7830000000001
Red glowing orb was in southern sky and went slightly west, turned white and then quickly faded into nothing.;2015-10-23 20:40:00;5 seconds;Red glowing orb was in southern sky and went slightly west, turned white and then quickly faded into nothing.  It had somewhat jagged edges & was almost like watching an explosion.  All 6 members of our family saw it happen.;35.4586;-86.7830000000001
