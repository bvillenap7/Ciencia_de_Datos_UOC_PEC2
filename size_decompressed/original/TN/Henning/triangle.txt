It was not a shooting star nor was it an aircraft from the United States Military.   I am not one to believe in UFO's BUT.....I do now.  I know what I saw.  These two objects were right side by side of each other.  they did not just fly off and it was nothing you could track.  They just vanished ....;35.6602;-89.6999
