Color changing object observed over/near cattle who were going crazy.;2012-01-04 17:44:00;In Progress;Color changing object observed over/near cattle who were going crazy. The object was observed hovering south westerly from the back of my location - the first noticeable characteristic of the object was the color changing.  It would stay green for approximately 2 minutes, then flash red, orange, yellow, red and back to green and repeat.  After approximately 10 minutes of observation, the object started moving.  It would oscillate side to side, then gain altitude slowly, then rapidly lose altitude.  It would then move side to side by performing a half moon drop and then ascending.  There were also very rapid movements in angles and radii that are both mathematically and physically impossible for any known man made air craft to perform.  Also curious, at this hour, as the object moves, I can hear cattle mooing and doing what I can best describe as screaming.  I have experience with military and commercial aircraft, both rotary wing and fixed... and  have seen and reported objects like this for a few years now.;35.6828999999999;-85.7652999999999
