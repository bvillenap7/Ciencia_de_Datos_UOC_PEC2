Very fast moving object in the night sky.;2014-07-03 21:30:00;20 seconds;Very fast moving object in the night sky. At approx. 9:30 pm Central Time on July 3, 2014, I was outside in my backyard securing the fence gate. I noticed a light moving in the sky in a Northern direction.  The light did not appear to be blinking or flashing but was solid white in color.  I thought at first it may have been a meteor or asteroid but it had no tail and I have seen these in the past but this object was very different in the way it moved through the sky.  The object was very fast it moved to the North in a speed much faster than any aircraft that I have ever seen.  We live in the flight path for Nashville International Airport (BNA) so I am use to seeing aircraft commercial and military in the sky during the day and night time.  The speed this thing was moving was amazing.  This was not fireworks, flares, a planet or any star.  By the time that I had told my brother about the object it had already went out of view.  I could not make out any size or shape.;35.6828999999999;-85.7652999999999
Red light viewed in sky in Bledsoe County State Forest on the Cumberland Plateau in Tennessee.;2015-02-04 17:00:00;10 minutes;Red light viewed in sky in Bledsoe County State Forest on the Cumberland Plateau in Tennessee. Watched red light that was not flashing in sky NE of my home.  Light set still approximately for 3 to 4 minutes.  A small airplane with flashing light flew behind it in an easterly direction.   Then the solid red light slowly moved in an easterly direction very slowly for approximately 2 minutes.   Then the red light went slowly straight upwards for approximately 1 minute.  Then the red light moved slowly back in a westerly direction for approximately 2 minutes.   Then the light blinked 1 time & went out in the sky just like you had turned a light switch off.   When I say moved slowly no airplane could move the slow.  It was like a crawl.   It was not a helicopter cause the light would have been flashing just like on an airplane.

Bright whitish red light over cow pasture. McMinnville, TN;2018-11-28 23:00:00;15 seconds;Bright whitish red light over cow pasture. McMinnville, TN I was driving home one night after hanging out with my friends.  I usually have a long drive home from town alone.  I always look at the sky when I can. I have a fascination with the stars and know where most of them will be when I look up.  But what was different about this star was that it was massive and bright.  It was white and had a faint red glow behind it.  It stayed in one spot for about 10 seconds.  I thought it may have been a spotlight from a plane.  But it was hovering over the cow pasture next to the road I was on.  By the time I had gotten a detailed look at it, the light did a loop and shot towards the mountain range in the distance.  It then flew upwards and was gone faster than anything I had ever seen or heard of.  I tried to debunk it the next night on my way home.  Maybe it was a reflecting light from behind me on the windshield.  But when I went back through I saw no reflecting lights.  It shook me to my core.  I believed in them, I just never thought Iâ€™d see one right in front of me.;35.6828999999999;-85.7652999999999
