Was standing at the river taking pics of the clouds and lightning and spotted the UFO after looking at the photo.  I can even see a vapor-like emission coming from the bottom as commonly described.  I can also make out what appears to be an orb-like formation in the center on the underside of the craft.  It is in the southwest direction.
