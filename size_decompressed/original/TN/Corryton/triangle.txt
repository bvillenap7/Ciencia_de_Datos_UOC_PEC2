triangular object appearing at low level in the outskirts of Knoxville, TN;2009-02-10 19:03:00;45 sec;triangular object appearing at low level in the outskirts of Knoxville, TN We live in a rural community and have a long Â½ mile gravel driveway with a field on the right hand side.  My three teenage and preteen children and I turned into the driveway and had stopped at the mailbox to get the mail when we saw some extremely bright lights at the far end of the field. I got out of the car and noticed it was moving slowly in a circular path.  It was triangular in shape, with 3 bright white lights at each corner.  The edges of the craft glowed with a dull silvery light.  It reminded me of the neon lights you see under cars.  In the center was an extremely large red light. It began to move slowly across the field and over the far end of my driveway.  I grabbed my phone and quickly took a picture with it as it passed over the woods on the other side of the driveway.  After about 45 seconds from when we first saw it and about 5-10 seconds after I took the picture it disappeared.  It did not shoot off, or leave any trails of light because of moving quickly, and did not go behind any hills or trees (there was nothing to obstruct the view).  It simple just disappeared.  My two oldest could verify the exact experience to my husband when we got to our house, so I know what we saw.  Hopefully, once I download my picture to my computer I will be able to zoom in and have it enhanced to better make out the objects shape.  Right now, the picture looks like a massively bright glowing object and you can see some metal at the edges of the light.;36.1174;-83.8164
