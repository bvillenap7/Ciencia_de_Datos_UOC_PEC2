Huge triangle with white lights over Tennessee, Kentucky Border;2003-07-09 00:30:00;10-12 minutes;Huge triangle with white lights over Tennessee, Kentucky Border My cousin and I were camping out in my front yard.  We were inside the tent, and we saw a light above us.  I got out, and saw a huge triangular craft.  It was gunmetal in color, and had bright white lights on each tip of it, with one also in the middle.  It was lighting up the yard, the lights were so bright.  It hovered over us for 10 to 12 minutes, before slowly moving off to the north. My family members who were inside at the time, heard the noise this craft was making, sort of a loud white noise sound, but didn't think to come out and check it.  The sound was pretty loud, too.;36.5734;-86.2314
