Oval dark green disc with greenish halo around object moving extremely fast and horizontal.;2013-05-25 23:14:00;4 seconds;Oval dark green disc with greenish halo around object moving extremely fast and horizontal. Saturday May 26th 2013 Time of Occurrence:   23:14 High Rate of Speed and Direction:    334 Degrees SE Unexplained eye sighting of an object which appeared suddenly from over my rooftop while sitting outside of my home on the back deck.  Object appeared to not be falling but moving horizontal along at a 334 degree heading sort of south east with a dark green oval disk in the center about cloud level and had a green halo around its entire structure moving extremely fast .  Only was visible for a few seconds before reaching the horizon.  Object was too fast for aircraft or weather balloon and also too large.  Full moon tonight and no explanation for what I saw.  Happened too fast for photo opportunity and called local authorities but apparently no one else saw or reported anything.  Never saw anything like it and have lived all over the USA. Very strange, with no sound whatsoever. No vapor trail or smoke trail.;35.7472;-86.5389
