I have never seen anything like this since, it wasn't an aircraft because it was going to fast and all of a sudden stopped then went skyward at an amazing rate of speed. I have never seen anything since. Thank you ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));35.265;-84.6008
