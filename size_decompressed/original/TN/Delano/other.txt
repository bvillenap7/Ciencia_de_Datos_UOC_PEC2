My friend and I were traveling north on highway 411 when we looked up to the right of the car above the trees and noticed an aircraft traveling with us soundless and almost in a floating way in the same speed of our car. We unexpected it and were shocked as it was no more than 75 feet in the air just higher than the electric lines. In our amazement we stayed focused making sure what each other saw was in fact something of not normal. It was white and had curved almost boomerang shaped wings going to a cone or small blimp like center no bigger than a van with continuous lighting all around the craft. After it stayed beside us for about 20 to 25 seconds is shot to the sky in a rediculous speed in an instant it was gone. I never believed in ufo's and laughed at people for believing. This sighting scared me and in fact this is the first time I have mentioned it since then. After being a disbeliever it's hard to expect anyone to believe my story, but I'd take a lie detector test in a second and my friend and I can give the same exact story.
