4 witnesses as sky goes insane.;2014-04-02 04:00:00;2 hours;4 witnesses as sky goes insane. Me and my buddies we're camping out and we were on top of a 45 foot high stack of covered round bales of hay.   My friend said Woah, man look at the satellite.  We began watching this object take a perfect path across the sky right above us, as we began talking about the object as it got farther away it did  a complete 180 and flew back right above at a insane speed.  We began questioning what we were all seeing.  It also was changing altitudes it would get really high then slowly come lower.  At its lowest point I saw 2 triangle shaped objects really close to each other, they were circling around one another as they both were zooming around,  I'm talking they were hauling butt, they would zoom left then right over and over for 2 hours, towards the end I saw the object change color and shape it went from orange to a whitish blue and had a teardropped light with 2 arbitures coming from both sides forming a spider leg type appearance my friends saw this change too.   We also thruster pulses.  Say if it would go left we would see thruster pulses coming from the right.   We were also around cows, the cows began mooing really loud as the object would get closer.  Also the object was emiting pulse type lights around it.;35.6173002559178;-87.0317002559209
