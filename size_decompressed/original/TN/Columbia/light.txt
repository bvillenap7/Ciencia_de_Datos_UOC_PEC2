Ball of light spotted over HWY 43 in Columbia, TN.;2008-02-10 02:45:00;4-6 seconds;Ball of light spotted over HWY 43 in Columbia, TN. My girlfriend and I were on the way home from a friends house around 2:45 AM on a Sunday  morning. I am an Educational Assistant in a elementary Special Education classroom. My girlfriend works in homes of Mentally Retarded individuals providing living aids. We were on HWY 43E when we noticed a ball of light appeared from no where and headed for the ground. It then went into a straight line parallel to our wind shield (left). The object then stopped and once again headed for the ground. Then it went diagonally up and to the left and was gone. Would of thought nothing of it if my girlfriend had not asked me if I saw it too.;35.6173002559178;-87.0317002559209

A silent light, which I first thought was nothing more than an airplane, was transiting the night sky from south to north.  It was a small, yellow-white light, and was not spectacular in any way.   When it was almost directly overhead, it stopped. It did not move up, down, or from side to side.  It was completely and absolutely stationary.  It was stationary for about five seconds and then suddenly, it flew due west at an extremely high rate of speed. If it was an aircraft, the inertial forces would have made it impossible for human pilots to withstand the g-forces of such acceleration. I walked back inside and my two year old daughter, who is learning to talk, was telling everyone Hush, hush, they're singing.  She did this for several minutes. My background:  I am an ordained minister, former pastor, and an adjunct professor at a private university in Nashville.;35.6173002559178;-87.0317002559209
