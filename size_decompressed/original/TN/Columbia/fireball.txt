Myself and 2 others went outside and watched the object as it moved slowley up and then started to move towards our house.  I pulled my phone out to record the object as it got closer it was moving so slow and as it got above us maybe a couple hundred feet off the ground the object was round with bright red color looked liked fire but it continued to move slow towards the south untill the tree's covered the view.  We went inside and as i looked at my phone to look at what i recorded well my phone said recording but i had no video but i know it was a aircraft and nothing i know of our military having matchs this craft as a army vet i was not sure of ufos but i know now.
