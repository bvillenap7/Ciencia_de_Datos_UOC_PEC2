U-shaped formation of orange gold lights travelling south at high speed.;1998-10-21 22:42:00;6s;U-shaped formation of orange gold lights travelling south at high speed. 10-21-98 22:42.  After star-gazing for 10-15 minutes my eyes were pretty well adjusted. I had seen only one high altitude jet and no shooting stars or satellites.  I was laying on a cot flat on my back inside a built up commercial/residential area with high background light level.  Very faint cumulus clouds, widely dispersed were present, but not in the section directly overhead where the objects were observed.  Sky was otherwise clear and stars particularly bright this evening.  I observed 12-15 objects travelling at a constant velocity and direction, very nearly due south. Their luminosity was equal among them and remained constant until obscured by tall trees nearby. Color was dim orange/gold. Objects were no more than points of light.  I would estimate the arc they traversed in approximately 6 seconds was no more than 35-40 degrees.  Objects were in a roughly U-shaped formation with the closed end leading. There were no sounds as there had been with the jet earlier.  Size of formation would comparable to 2 finger widths at arms length.;35.6173002559178;-87.0317002559209
Low altitude, slow moving orange fireball aura with spherical shape, silent;2013-03-27 23:27:00;6 minutes;Low altitude, slow moving orange fireball aura with spherical shape, silent My family and I reside no more than 3 miles from the square.  My father, sister, and I were removing some things from the trunk of my car....this around 11:20 or so that night. They noticed the objects first while standing on the porch meanwhile, I was digging in the trunk.  Finally, I happened to hear their call to &quotlook up&quot....none of us have ever seen anything like it.  This is the middle of town...they werent very luminous (could barely get them on camera)...but glowed with an orange fireball look....slowly moving across the sky a little faster than a balloon floating. Low altitude....silent. We watched the two objects- one following the other- as they flew overhead going west. No distinct &quotshape&quot other than a spherical w/ fireball aura that we observed as they flew over us. Have been wondering what they were ever since.;35.6173002559178;-87.0317002559209
4 lights in square formation in Columbia, TN.;2015-10-31 21:00:00;10 minutes;4 lights in square formation in Columbia, TN At approximately 9 p.m. on Saturday, October 31, 2015, my daughter and I were driving south on Hwy 43 towards Columbia, TN, when we saw 4 bright lights in the sky on the driverâ€™s side of the car.  They were approximately 50 feet in the air.   At first we thought they were lighting up a haunted attraction for Halloween, but after looking a bit longer, we noticed there were points of more concentrated lights at each corner, so the light source was coming from above, not the ground.  They maintained a square shape, and looked like 4 lights, but occasionally a light would travel from one corner to another in a random fashion, so there may have been as many as 8 lights total.   They were ahead of us at first on the left, but as we approached the main intersection of Hwy 43 with Hwy 31 the lights were keeping pace with us.  My daughter snapped a couple of photos with her phone.   We crossed the intersection and the lights were still pacing us, as they continued to do for se! veral more miles.   Then I looked back over and they were not there.  We were relieved, but a few minutes later they were slightly ahead of us, kept pace for at least 5 more miles, then disappeared.;35.6173002559178;-87.0317002559209
