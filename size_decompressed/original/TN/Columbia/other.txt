Bright round object, moving different directions, speeds and altitudes at amazing speed.;2013-04-08 20:32:00;2 minutes;Bright round object, moving different directions, speeds and altitudes at amazing speed. North of Columbia, object was a round, VERY bright object with a smaller round bright light no one of its sides.   Was larger than the stars and the airplanes that came after. Object was heading up toward the atmosphere then shifted directly east of its location.   Object began to head south (toward the direction of my location) while its main light began to shine brighter.   Object looked to then head north while dropping altitude slightly.  Object disappeared to my visibility due to the tree line around my perimeter.;35.6173002559178;-87.0317002559209
