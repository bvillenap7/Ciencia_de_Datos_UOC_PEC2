Mr. ((name deleted));2004-06-02 22:15:00;20 seconds;((name deleted)) At first I thought I was seeing a large meteorite traveling horizontally across the night sky.  But then I noticed there was no trail and it was symmetrical and solid.  It was traveling south at a high rate of speed as the military jets do when they fly the treetops around here but it was dark.  There was only one light and no flashing lights the way aircraft have. From my perspective it was about twenty percent the size of the moon.  It seemed to gain altitude and then went around the tip of the mountain to the south the way a military jet would, made a left turn and disappeared.  It was very fast and very smooth.  It had no flashing lights and made no sound.  It was too fast for a helicopter.;36.1814;-82.9631
