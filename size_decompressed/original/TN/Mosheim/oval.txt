Red Oval object in the mountains of Tennessee;1989-12-17 22:00:00;5 minutes;Red Oval object in the mountains of Tennessee I remember this very vividly since it occured around my birthday and my parents scoffed since it was before Christmas.  I heard my Old English Sheepdog franticly barking and I veered out my window of my 3 story house and saw a red oval object hooving about 500 yards from my home over the pine forest on the back of our home estate.  It  was hoovering for approximately 5 mins, then in snap propelled into the atmosphere in less than a span of time of 2 seconds.;36.1814;-82.9631
