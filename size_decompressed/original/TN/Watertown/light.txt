Strange blinking lights that hover appearing in the sky several nights in a row, all at the same time each night. ((Star??));2008-06-05 23:00:00;3:00;Strange blinking lights that hover appearing in the sky several nights in a row, all at the same time each night. We live in Watertown, TN. For the past 8 nights in a row we have observed on each night several unidentified objects in the sky. Each night they are in the same areas and positions numbering around a dozen or so.  There seems to one in particular that is always in the same area of the sdy. When viewed with the naked eye, it appears to be one light that moves. When viewed through binoculars, it is actually two close together in proximity. These objects hover with no noise audible. They move in strange patterns. If one looks at the sky briefly, they appear to be star-like. Looking at them for a few seconds and longer you see that they are definitely NOT stars.  These objects appear around the same time each night and stay for several hours. We watch them appear each night between 10:30 - 11:00 PM CST. They leave around 2:00 - 3:00 AM CST.  Also an interesting detail: we live in a rural area and the television viewing we have is via satellite. Our satellite signal is blocked on almost all channels while the objects are near. We usually have about 3 or 4 of our channels that will acually come in while the rest of the channels say there is a signal error. Coincidence? Maybe or maybe not, we are not sure.;36.0956;-86.1388
