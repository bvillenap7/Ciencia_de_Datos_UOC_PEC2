smithville /sink creek ufo hotbed;1999-09-15 07:00:00;5 min;smithville /sink creek ufo hotbed Object was spotted about 50 feet off the ground close to Webbs chapel church close to Sink Creek. Esimated size was around 30-45 feet wide by 15 feet high. There was multicolored lights that were best described as neon at best in color. No sound as it floated by going estimated 25-35 mph over road. No sound emmited as it went by.It was not any known  aircraft that I am familiar with. I have worked with the govenerment on black Projects and this object floored me.  I have no idea what it was. I have noticed that this 15 mile square area is a  hotbed for odd objects in sky. Unlike some ufologists, I have worked on unknown projects and know 99.9% unknown  ufos are new military planes but his was nothing like we have or will have for 50 years. It was almost like it was propelled by gravity. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Source elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));35.9267;-85.8075
