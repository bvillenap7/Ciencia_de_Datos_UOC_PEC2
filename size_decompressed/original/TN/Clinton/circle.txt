I saw a circular object with around 10 lights in a circular patten around it,.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the star, Sirius.  PD));2017-02-05 21:00:00;1 minute;I saw a circular object with around 10 lights in a circular patten around it, and it was shifting left and right for around 20 seconds. Walked outside during the super bowl.  Looked up and there was a bright light in the sky, way up in the sky.  I thought it must be an airplane, but its lights were different.  There were probably 10 lights, white-ish in color in a circular pattern around a circular object.  I still thought this has to be an airplane, but it was sitting in one place not moving.   Then when it did move it shifted left and the back to the right.  At this point I went to get my family, but when we came back it was gone.   If I had to give a direction of where I saw it in the sky it would have been a little to the left of where the constellation, Orion or Orions belt is.  But at an airplanes causing (sic.  airplane's cruising  ??)) altitude.;36.0869;-84.1897
