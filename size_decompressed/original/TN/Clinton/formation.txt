Bright lights over Clinton, TN.;2016-08-11 18:00:00;150 seconds;Bright lights over Clinton, TN I was in my garden in the afternoon of August 11, 2016, spraying some of the plants.  The time was approximately 5:45 EDT.  I was also looking for a good place for a chair, so I could sit and watch the meteor shower later that night.  I looked toward the sky to find the most open spot in the trees.   I noticed the objects in the eastern sky in about the 2 o'clock position.  There were five round, bright lights.  Two in the front and three in the rear.  The three in the rear were in formation.   I turned on my phone and opened the camera app and began to record video.  The sun was bright and I had trouble seeing the screen, so I was just guessing where to point in the beginning.  Then I was able to get in a position to see the phone's screen.   I recorded video for about two minutes.  The two in front were moving north and then stopped for a few seconds.  Then one moved quickly of view and then the other did as well.  The three in formation began moving toward the north.  The lights began to fade and I stopped recording.  I noticed after I stopped the video, there was a dark object where one of the forward lights had been.  The object appeared to have a shadowy aura.  It then moved north out of view.  I estimate the length of time from when I first saw the objects until they were no longer in view to be about 2 Â½ minutes.;36.0869;-84.1897
