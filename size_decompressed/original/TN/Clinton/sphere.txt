Organe flcikering spheres heading east of Clinton Tn;2013-03-15 09:00:00;5 minutes;Organe flcikering spheres heading east of Clinton Tn At 09:20 PM I went outside to smoke a cigarette and looked to the right of me. Heading east in the sky I noticed about 5 to 6 orange sphere's floating through the night sky.  I watched them &quotfloat&quot east wards towards Norris TN.  They went by at a rather slow pace. Some closer than others.  I watched as they all disappeared behind a Wooded area tree line. I then called NUFORC to report my encounter. Thank you.;36.0869;-84.1897
