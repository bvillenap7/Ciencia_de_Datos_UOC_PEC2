Blue triangle.  ((anonymous report));2017-09-25 23:00:00;30 minutes;Blue triangle Went outside to smoke and a blueish craft was clearly seen above my neighbor's house it had a triangle shape and was pulsating a baby blue light I've never seen something so impossible to my eyes it stayed for awhile I would say 25 to 30 min., but the weird part is I left my phone charging in the room and it felt like no time passed at all.
