Red and blue sphere connected to brightly lit, hovering craft in Nashville;2013-11-18 19:00:00;2 hours;Red and blue sphere connected to brightly lit, hovering craft in Nashville I observed a very bright stationary white light in the sky, within several miles of my home, at a relatively low altitude, to the northwest, toward South Nashville, in the general direction of the airport.  It appeared to be hovering and have a set of extremely bright lights.  As it sat there, not moving, I took several photos of it (attached).  As I set up to shoot and began to focus, several bright lights going extremely fast and curling tightly, like a berserk firework, shot across my view finder.  They never appeared again.  I focused in on the bright lights, still stationary, and took a series of photos.  To my surprise, the light did not show up...only pictures of a strange blue and red orb.  See to believe.;36.0571;-86.6728999999998
