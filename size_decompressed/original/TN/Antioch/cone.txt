Bright White Conical light crossing interstate.;2017-12-19 19:30:00;5 seconds;Bright White Conical light crossing interstate While driving Southeast on Interstate 24 I saw a Conical shaped extremely bright white object that appeared moving from left to right in the vision of my windshield covering about 90% of the area of my windshield.  It seemed to take 5 to 6 seconds to cross the windshield.  The brightness illuminated the interior of my vehicle but did not affect my vision.  I felt a warmth across my face as I saw it traverse across my field of vision.  During the sighting, I could hear a very light static sound. It seemed to disappear once it had traversed my vision across the windshield.;36.0571;-86.6728999999998
