Star like object grows in brightness then fades away.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probably a sighting of an Iridium satellite.  PD));2012-06-29 03:15:00;10 seconds;Star like object grows in brightness then fades away Was having trouble sleeping so got up and went outside for fresh air.   While on my front porch, looked up to see a very faint star light object in the eastern sky.  While looking at it, it suddenly flaired up in brightness to a magnitude similar to Venus.   It then slowly faded till it was no longer visible.  There was no apparent movement.  I did not see any indications once it faded of running lights like those on aircraft.   My first thought was a pilot had turned on his landing lights but the way it faded on then faded off is not indictive of that. Aircraft lights instantly come on and off rather than fading as this object did.;36.0571;-86.6728999999998
