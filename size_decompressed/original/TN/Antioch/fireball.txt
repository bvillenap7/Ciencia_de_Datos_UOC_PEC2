A bright fireball seen with some movement in Nashville, TN area...;2012-03-23 23:00:00;5 seconds;A bright fireball seen with some movement in Nashville, TN area... At 11PM I stepped out on the front landing/porch of my house to call the kittys in for the night. I live in a subdividison neighborhood in Nashville, TN area.  In the sky above the neighborhood, high but not up in the plane lanes, I suddenly saw a bright fireball.  From my perspective it could have been two inches round. It was bright orange/yellow/with some red like fire colors.  It did move from left to right some, then disappeared.  I waited for awhile for it to return, I even checked about 30 minutes later..but didn't see it again. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
