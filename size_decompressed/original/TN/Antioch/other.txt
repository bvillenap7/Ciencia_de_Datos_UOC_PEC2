Black Squarish Object Shifting and moving Slowly;2013-08-20 17:00:00;10 minutes;Black Squarish Object Shifting and moving Slowly Was driving down Murfreesboro road with a couple of friends heading south. In front of Publix on Murfreesboro road Antioch, Tn.  I was in the back seat when i noticed a black squarish object heading in the opposite direction.  Ended up at a red light and mentioned it to my friends that i saw something and the passenger acknowledged it also and wondered what it was.  Driver has not seen anything by this point.  The object was behind a tree during the stop.  Light turns green and when the object became visible from behind the tree it did not seem to have the same shape that it had earlier.  Maybe 1 and a half minutes prior. I started thinking to myself maybe it was a witch commonly known as Brujas in Mexico, and right as i thought that the passenger mentioned that it looks like a human flying, and i agreed.  The object seem to have looked different from different points of view as if it were shifting in some way.  We ended up parking in a parking lot to take time to ! look at it and it seemed to have become stationary and rotating slowly heading in a perfect horizontal direction north towards Nashville.  The object must have been 200 yards to our right of the street and about 300 or 400 yards up in the sky.  Black sqaurish object that eventually didn't look like it did in the beginning.  It was more oval by the time we ended having to go with protrusions out form the bottom but were not pointed.  There was good thunderstorms that night in Nashville that continued to the next day.  So maybe there is a small connection there. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));36.0571;-86.6728999999998
