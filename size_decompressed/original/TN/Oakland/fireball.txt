Fireball outside my den window 2 witnesses;2008-11-10 19:00:00;15 seconds;Fireball outside my den window 2 witnesses My wife (who was six months pregnant at the time) and I were sitting in our den watching television at around seven in the evening.  Our tv is elevated and in a nook and is between two six foot by three foot windows.  I was sitting on one couch and my wife in the loveseat, they are set up with one long couch directly facing the tv and the loveseat to the left along the wall.   Suddenly and without warning, I noticed a beach volley ball sized fireball right outside my window just hovering there...totally stunned, I stared at this object for a good fifteen seconds before it flew away at an extremely high rate of speed....by that I mean shot out of a cannon speed....basically it disappeared but I saw a glowing streak as it left....probably my eyes trying to catch up....very very bright flaming ball...I looked at my wife and asked her if she just saw something outside our window...I didn't tell her what I saw bc I wanted to make sure she wasn't being lead by my s! tory...we described exactly the same story....from two different angles in the room.... My house is in a new subdivision and I am on a corner lot...on one side I have a vacant lot and the other is a house but it was vacant as the owners were both doctors and were transferred...so basically I am saying that there is no reasonable explanation for this...it was literally ten feet from us and two feet outside our window! Our backyard is fenced and locked from the inside also...after my daughter was born we filmed on our phone an orb hovering over my daughters bed in back and forth patterns...definitely not random movement as would be expected with dust particles or something picked up by the night vision cameras...also it instantly disappeared when my wife cracked the door to see if she could see it with her own eyes....I have no idea what to think of these occurrences!
