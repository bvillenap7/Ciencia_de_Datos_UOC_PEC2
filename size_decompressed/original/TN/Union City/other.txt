We receive many such reports.)) at first we thought it was a star,but it was moving in a downward direction and it was slowly changing color from white to red and blue.after moving down toward ground it moved toward the north til it was out of sight on 5/19 and 5/20 around 10:00 my girlfriend noticed a star in the sky that appeared to be moving toward the ground. we watched it as it went behind a tree and we could see it move down further.it changed colors from white to red to blue in different cycles.after we lost it behind the tree,it appeared to move toward the left(north,i think)and continued in that direction until it was out of sight.on the 19th we followed it in the car until we could go no further.the next night we saw it the at the same time and it lasted the same amount of time (1 1/2 hours)i don't know what it was,but i wanted to report it.the second night we saaw an airplane(i think) that was following the same course as the object,but it was about 15 minutes after it was gone.;36.4278;-89.0653000000001
