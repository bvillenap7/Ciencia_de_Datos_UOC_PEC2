2 possible crafts above Union City, TN.;2019-07-09 21:50:00;~2 minutes;2 possible crafts above Union City, TN Let me start by saying I did not see the first craft, only the way a cloud reacted.  The second was a flash further south above the clouds moving in the same direction as the first. I was standing in the back door of my home smoking and looking up at the moon.  I noticed a small cloud (back lit by the moon) seem to change and it caught my attention.  It seemed to swirl for a moment and then strung out toward the north-west. I thought nothing of it at first and brushed it off as strange weather. Looking farther south now, where a storm seemed to be brewing, accompanied by lightning flashes, I saw a strange flash (oblong above the clouds and not in the same area as the lightning.)  The flash seemed to move toward the same direction as the first phenomenon. This really got my attention. Suddenly my right hand, the right side of my neck, and my right ear felt hot.  This lasted for maybe 10 seconds then faded.  After this I felt sick and had to close the door and rush to the bathroom.  As soon as I left the back door however the feeling passed.  This feeling has never happened to me before but has left me shaken.;36.4278;-89.0653000000001
