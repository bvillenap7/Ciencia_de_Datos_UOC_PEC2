Bright light over small town.;2010-07-20 04:00:00;about 3 minutes;Bright light over small town. Me and my friend have seen multiple thing like this, but this one really made me wanna speak up. i was standing outside smoking and i saw a bright light out that seemed to have a circlular shadow around it in the sky, it started comin above the tree line then continued to quickly rise up in the sky. Then a second light, not as bright, came up below it, after about a minute, the second one faded away. I started getting a bad feeling like i shouldn't be seeing it. So i came in and found somewhere to report it.;35.9103;-89.248
