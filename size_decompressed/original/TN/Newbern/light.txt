amber colored light,moves slowly, occasionally disappears in plain view;1999-10-15 19:20:00;2 min.;amber colored light,moves slowly, occasionally disappears in plain view I believe oct. was the first time i noticed this obeject, have seen it approximatel 5 or 6 times. witnesses not present, but have seen object in or near their area at various times in past months. would think it a plane but often as it is viewed it simply cuts off or disappears from view, NO CLOUD COVER. i initially witnessed it at about 19:20 coming out of east. no blinking lights just amber glow. about jupiter size. moves steadily. as it reached about 45 degrees overhead of my position it just shut off. watched for several minutes, heard nothing, and light did not reappear. other occasions it has just flown over area,no sound.  sometimes still pulls vanishing act. No cloud,no trees, just into thin air. other witnesses confirm similar activity. also have recently noticed military activity, blk helicopter,military jets in formation etc. not sure if it is some sort of plane or what. i am a skeptic but open minded. thought you should know to compare if any other reports. like to know the truth.;36.1041;-89.2492
