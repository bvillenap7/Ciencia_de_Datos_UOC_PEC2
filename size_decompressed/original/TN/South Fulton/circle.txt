I walked outside to smoke a cigarette  and what appears to be a bright star in the eastern sky caught my attention.  After a few seconds it slowly started moving in a way I can hardly describe.  It was as if it moved in a reverse j like pattern, moving from a large, bright shape to a duller one . Then a quick burst of red light and it was gone.;36.4841;-88.895
