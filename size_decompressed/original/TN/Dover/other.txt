Dropping lights catch the eye.;2002-01-25 20:15:00;4 minutes tops;Dropping lights catch the eye. My wife and two boys, one 7 yrs and one 8 months, and I, were on our way to mother-in-laws house for the wife's Birthday party.  Long and winding roads, through alot of hilly areas.  I took notice of it first, at first it looked like a radio tower with one light at the top, white light with a slight out of focus haze.  And also another light just above and to the left, wasn't sure if I thought it was a star or what.  Then as I looked at it right before my eyes a light of the same size and shape dropped out of the bottom of it, went straight down, and we started on a patch of road that led us by some leafless trees, but we 3 all seen it.  My wife I believe only seen one drop, because of driving and watching the road, but I kept turning and watching.  I seen three lights drop in a vertical strait line, then the light that was above and to the left seemed to move strait about what I origanally thought was a tower light.  They started getting close to each other, the lower one did not seem to drop in height but the one above did.  Then we went around a corner and came back around again after passing a few trees and the lights had vanished.  I never seen the ligts hit the ground or what exactly happened to them that dropped.  It was a creepy feeling.;36.4911;-87.8798
