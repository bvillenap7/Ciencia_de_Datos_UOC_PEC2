Fireball heading south.;2013-06-22 21:30:00;2 minutes;Fireball heading south Spouse was outside with our dogs and called me out.   Saw orange/red light move across the sky very quickly from one area to another.   Then the light stopped...looked to be almost parallel to a star next to it.   Light hovered about 10 seconds, began to blink and then dropped down a bit  and blinked out of sight.   Came from the north and appeared to be heading south when the light blinked out.;35.9314;-86.6867000000001
