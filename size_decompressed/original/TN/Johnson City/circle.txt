2, 3, then 4 red lights that stayed stationary, moved in and out and towards each other, at one point seemed very close.;2012-05-18 00:05:00;5-10mins;2, 3, then 4 red lights that stayed stationary, moved in and out and towards each other, at one point seemed very close. I was going to bed, seen a glimps of red light out my window and thought it was an red/orangeish moon. So i stopped ato look at it for a second and noticed it was smaller than the moon and there were 2 objects. My second thought was mayb they were fireworks but they never exploded and stayed stationary. I ran downstairs went outside and stood and watched them for a min or so. They started to drift off so I came back inside, went back into my bedroom and seen them again outside my window, even closer this time and by this time there were 3.  Then I ran back downstairs and watched them again.  The second time i went outside there were 4 and 3 were stationary and 1 moved in toward another (across) and back out again.  The lights were red and were not connected to an object. They did not move up or down. just closer and farther away and at points some stayed stationary while others moved in and out.  I have not seen anything like it befor and as close as they seemed! at one point if it was a aircraft ...helocopter or something it would have made a sound. We have a medical center helocopter and I know that it looks like at night in the sky. This was not any kind of aircraft that i had ever seen.  They looked separate too. I didn't get any sleep all night. I slept on my couch with all the lights on and kept waking up, no rest at all. Honestly, Im afraid to look out my window now at night. I don't want to see it again.;36.3292443337485;-82.371304109589

It was unreal I didn't know what to think.   And I was sober trying to explain this...thought it was a shooting star but I didn't think there are any green large shooting stars to my knowledge.

Circular shaped object with red/orange and green lights, unbelievable movement.;2014-07-04 20:30:00;20 minutes;Circular shaped object with red/orange and green lights, unbelievable movement. At approximately 9:30pm in Johnson City, Tennessee while waiting for a 4th of July celebration, a circle shaped object was hovering in the sky behind me opposite to where the fireworks were going to be shot.  It had a constant flashing of lights from green to red/orange color.  It moved in a way that I have never seen before.  It was fast and would just stop completely still then shift left to right very fast then change directions.   It stayed there through almost the whole show then shot north towards Virginia.  I have never believed in things like this but I cannot lie about what I saw;36.3292443337485;-82.371304109589
Five lights seen moving over Johnson City looking like bright red-orange fire before vanishing.;2015-08-10 21:30:00;20 minutes;Five lights seen moving over Johnson City, looking like bright red-orange fire before vanishing. My girlfriend and I came outside at roughly 9:30 to smoke a cigarette.  After a few minutes we saw what looked like a circle of red-orange fire move across the sky.  It appeared to move slightly faster than the life-flight helicopters that we see occasionally see as we live near the local hospital.  As we watched it, the object began moving erratically and suddenly became dark but still visible against the clouds. Shortly thereafter, another fast-moving ball with the same coloration appeared and followed roughly the same path before vanishing. We decided to wait and see if any more objects flew by.  Sure enough another two balls of red-orange appeared behind the tree line, moving slightly slower than the first, before turning at almost a 90Â° angle and vanishing. Our neighbor from across the street was out walking his dogs at the time and had stopped at the corner of our road, having seen the second set of lights.  His dogs barked as the lights before they faded from view. Before continuing over to say his hellos a final ball appeared, rising significantly higher than the previous lights, turning slightly and then vanishing.;36.3292443337485;-82.371304109589
