Aircraft near miss with a meteor, subsequent sightings.  ((NUFORC Note:  Report from former MUFON State Director.  PD));2006-09-11 22:05:00;20 minutes;Aircraft near miss with a meteor, subsequent sightings Appalachian recieved a report and confirmed with the FAA that a regional aircraft pilot reported a near collision with a meteor (22:05)while flying west of Tri-Cities at an altitude of 4500 feet. The pilot reported the meteor was at his elevation , in a level trajectory and very slow. Subsequently, several calls to the FAA  control center at Tri Cities  inquired about a burning aircraft. Minutes later, a witness (who knew nothing about the aircraft report) reported having observed a large dark cigar shaped object hovering  low over downtown Johnson City. She described the object as looking like a Vietnam helicopter( we assume a Chinook) with no props. The object was observed for several minutes as the witness drove.  The object it's self was described as long, blunt , silent and having a white light on top and bottom with a larger light on the end which was hanging some 45 degrees lower toward the ground on this end.  The witness reported that the object ascended and moved off quickly to the southeast. Yet another  report came in from Carter County from a person listening to a scanner and heard a discussion regarding a  unidentified flying object, laughter and a request to discuss the subject by cell phone instead of radio. A request to the county 911 office for futher information could find no records regarding this ufo. All of these events took place within a 20-30 minute  time frame which lead us to believe thay are possibly related.
