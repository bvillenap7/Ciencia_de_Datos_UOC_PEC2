I saw a flash of light come from sky along with what looked like lightning bolts.  It was a ball of light that looked like the sun only brighter and bigger.  The ball of light floated up in sky it left a rainbow and also a pink  streak coming down from the sky.  The steak remained longer than the rainbow.  I have a video and pics;36.3292443337485;-82.371304109589
