5 unusual lights appeared and disappeared into thin air.;2012-04-15 20:00:00;1 minute;5 unusual lights appeared and disappeared into thin air. My husband and I were standing outside and it had just turned dark. Clear skies.  The moon wasn't out yet. We looked up to see 2 air crafts that were flying pretty close to each other.  Then in a split of a second, one of them disappeared.  Could see no lights.  When that one disappeared ( maybe it shut it's lights off?)  3 more appeared. It's like they appeared out of thin air. The 3 new ones were traveling not far from one of the first 2 that I saw.  They didn't appear to be going fast and had no sound and no trail like jets do.  The last 3 were traveling in what looked like a triangle shape. The thing is, I have never seen the color of lights on any other aircraft.  Dark orange and red. The orange was much brighter than the red.  They were traveling a little higher than what a helicopter flies. and not as high as what a small plane flies.  Now, I don't believe in UFO's but for a split second..I thought about it. haha! not really but maybe they were military.  It was so weird because as quickly as they appeared out of nowhere, they disappeared in the same manner. Now you see it now you don't kind of thing. What kind of air crafts fly 5 at a time. They seemed close, like what you see when there are air shows and they fly in formation. It was really strange.  We don't have any military base around here at all.;36.3292443337485;-82.371304109589
