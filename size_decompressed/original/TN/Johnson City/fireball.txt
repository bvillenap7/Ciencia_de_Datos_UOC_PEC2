Very bright object in sky.;2005-05-07 21:45:00;20 seconds;Very bright object in sky. I was on my back porch and looked up and saw a bright object in the sky. At first I thought it was an airplane cause we are close to the airport and they turn their lights on when approaching the airport.  When I realized it wasn't an airplane I thought maybe it was a shooting star. It was very bright and lit up the sky. But what was so strange is, it was coming down (it was very high in the sky) at a high rate of speed then suddenly slowed down and took a left turn and then became a very faint light and then disappeared.  I sat and thought about it for a while to be sure it wasn't a plane and realized that it couldn't have been. The way it turned and the way it was coming down, there is no way a plane can move like that. It was very strange and very surreal feeling to have witnessed something like that.  I was thinking maybe some government had something entering the earths atmosphere. Like a satellite or something. Because that is what it looked like something entering the atmosphere and turning and flying away.

Orange and red circular fireball object traveling north about Interstate US Route 26.;2014-07-12 22:50:00;5 minutes;Orange and red circular fireball object traveling north about Interstate US Route 26. I was driving south on US Route 26, nearing exit 19, when I noticed a circular orange ball in the sky, traveling northeast.  It flew directly over me while I was traveling on the interstate.   At first I was not concerned about the sitting, but a truck was pulled off onto the right median and they were looking up and over there shoulder and pointing at the object.   I veered off the interstate and started driving north on North Roan Street.  The object appeared to flash red at times, but this was not the same red light that flashes on an airplane.  It seemed to be circling back south.   I proceeded to my destination, and watched as the fireball moved out of site to the north.  I probably wouldn't have posted this if it wasn't for the truck that was parked on the median also looking at the same object.   I would estimate that it was two to five thousand feet in the air and had no sound at all.;36.3292443337485;-82.371304109589
