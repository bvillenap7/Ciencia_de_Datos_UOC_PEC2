Green glow emerges from Buffalo Mountain.;2014-12-27 16:55:00;1 minute;Green Glow emerges from Buffalo Mountain While standing on top of the Radio Tower on Buffalo Mountain in the Tri Cities area (possibly Johnson City but also could have been Unicoi), I was taking pictures of the sunset over the Western Horizon.  Within one minute, I took roughly seven photos and two of the photos captured the same, unknown image.  None of the three people present saw anything with the naked eye and we did not notice the images until the following day. 	The first photo taken at 16:55 & 38 seconds captured a very bright green glowing object that appeared to be illuminating from the trees, as if it were on the ground.  The bright green glow also appears to be surrounding a physical object which reveals a shadow below it.  The shape is truly unknown but appears to be a diamond or a T shape. The second image taken at 16:56 & 5 seconds captured the image closer to the camera and appears to be in front of the tree line closest to us in the air.  Oddly enough, this image does not reflect any solid shape or object. Including in report but might not be crucial to the event:  One of the people present was testing a new HAM Radio while on top of the tower.  He made a connection and was chatting with another licensed radio user while I took the photos.  During this time, there was about 20 seconds of radio disturbance and then went back to clear.;36.3292443337485;-82.371304109589
3-4 Reflective Objects At Low Altitude Over Johnson City, Tennessee.;2018-04-29 17:30:00;5 minutes;3-4 Reflective Objects At Low Altitude Over Johnson City, Tennessee. My wife, kids, and I were traveling roughly North on State of Franklin Road going toward Sam’s Club.  My wife and I were sitting in the front of the vehicle, so we were the first to notice flashes of light (reflections) coming from 3 (possibly 4) objects that were traveling due east at tree top level parallel to interstate 26.  I say “possibly 4” because I only saw 3, but my wife says she saw 4 objects.   They were invisible against the trees as they traveled along a hillside and flashed (sun reflection off of metallic surface?) frequently as they were apparently shifting side to side or possibly wobbling as they traveled.  We could not make out a shape.  Therefore, estimating a size of the objects difficult.  They were traveling at a rate of approximately 30-40 miles per hour.   We quickly lost sight of all but one of the objects which traveled approximately a mile away and remained stationary at about 6,000 feet.  It appeared to rock back and forth which continued to cause the reflective flashes as we saw on the other objects.  In between flashes the object appeared to be black.  We watched it for about 3 minutes and then went into the store.  It was gone by the time we finished shopping 10 minutes later.   If I had to guess at size I would say 15-10 feet wide.  They did not behave like any commercial aircraft I have ever seen, nor did they act like remote control planes or drones that I have ever observed.  Lots of people were on the road and out at this time, so I’m hoping that others saw this and will report as well.;36.3292443337485;-82.371304109589

He tried to debunk it, still didnt leave that area, we did notice it moved more side to side not up or down, always white then red light and soemtimes blue when it was flashing fast then the flikering or flash would slow down but always constant.Thought perhaps helicopter, they're super l! oud at night so we would have heard that. Still there in same place its been almost an hour so not sure what it could be? My husband swore he seen a red beam, I didnt but I could have missed it and  looked away while recording.;36.3292443337485;-82.371304109589
