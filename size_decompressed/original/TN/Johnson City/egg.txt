College Professor reports acorn shaped anomolous object;2004-09-19 22:00:00;8 minutes;College Professor reports acorn shaped anomolous object On this evening, I recieved a call from an Algebra Professor(ret) from a local college who reported to me that he was driving south on hwy 11-e just outside Johnson City when he saw a brilliantly lit, multi-colored object flying in tight circles to his southeast over a mountain. He pulled his car over to the side of the road and watched the object for some 8 minutes  as it performed impossible flight manuevers. He described the object as looking like an acorn with many  lights in a ring around the base, flashing randomly red, blue, white ,yellow, magenta. He also saw what appeared to be an appendage of lights appearing to hang below the main body, also flashing. After watching the object fly for several minutes, it slowly moved up and behind the nearby mountain. MUFON finds the witness highly reliable, accurate in his testimony and feel he did witness something quite strange.
