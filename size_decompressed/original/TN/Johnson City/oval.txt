Interesting object in Transport on Interstate 81 heading north in Tennessee.;2008-01-26 13:30:00;15 MINUTES;Interesting object in Transport on Interstate 81 heading north in Tennessee. The object was on the back of a flat bed transfer truck traveling north on interstate 81. It was covered and wrapped in a teal green tarp very tightly. The object was a disk like shape with two symetrical fins coming off the front or back. The general size was roughly a little larger than a private prop plane. There were two cars infront of the truck and two behind all with different plates. All the vehicles had tinted windows and were white in color. From what my wife and I could see all the occupants of the vehicles were clean cut white males in what appeared to be white button down shirts. They made efforts to stay closley grouped as not to have any other cars come within the formation. The shape of the craft had a similar shape to that of the ships depictded in Independence Day. The whole situation was rather odd when we began to think of everything as a whole. What better way to hide something than in plain sight. The object was secured on a steel tube frame and was like I stated earlier very tight. No surface area was exposed and and the object hung over roughly 3-4 feet on each side of the bed. It was positioned at an angle on the truck because of its size. Traffic was rather heavy that day and I am sure others had the same thoughts because several people ahead of me on the road slowed down to take a second look.
