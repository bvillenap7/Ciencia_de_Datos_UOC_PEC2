It looked like a bright red star. It did NOT flicker/flash. It was moving faster than your average plane, but not significantly faster. Was moving West NW. Appeared to bounce up and down a little, but could have been eye trick. No sound whatsoever. After observing it for about a minute, I went inside and asked my husband to check it out. He came outside and we watched it cross the sky for another minute or two. He also commented that a bright non-flickering red light on an aircraft was strange.;36.3292443337485;-82.371304109589
White or metallic orb in sky;2021-05-31 15:04:00;10 minutes;White or metallic orb in sky I was sitting outside when I noticed a white or metallic sphere in the sky. It did not move quickly but did move toward me from north to south, opposite of the direction of the few clouds that were in the sky. The sphere appeared to move back and forth along an axis or like a gyroscope as it moved across the sky. I took photos and video with my cell phone and sent to friends. When I looked back toward the sky, less than 2 minutes later, the sphere was nowhere to be seen. This was odd to me as it wasn't a quick moving object and would not have logically been able to move out of sight in that amount of time.;36.3292443337485;-82.371304109589
