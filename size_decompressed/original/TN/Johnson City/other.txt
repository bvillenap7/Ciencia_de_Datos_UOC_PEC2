Stingray shaped object spotted;2005-03-12 22:50:00;less than 10 seconds;Stingray shaped object spotted We saw a strange object that came from the south heading north. It was a completely clear night out no clouds in the sky what so ever. We estimated that the object was about 200-500 feet above tree top level. The object made no noise, it moved through our field of view in less than 10 seconds. It had an appearance of a stingray shape, the middle underside of the object was lit up but had a tan-brownish color, the edges of the object were distinguisable. It was a smaller size object, not apparent aircraft size (much smaller). No position lights were seen.  One of the observers has worked on aircrafts for 10 years both military and civillian and what was seen was nothing that could be explained.;36.3292443337485;-82.371304109589
