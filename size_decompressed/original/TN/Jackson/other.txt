Cresent moon shaped row of solid white lights gliding acros the sky in a northern direction for about 10 sec.;2011-05-21 22:15:00;10 sec;Cresent moon shaped row of solid white lights gliding acros the sky in a northern direction for about 10sec. Date of Sighting: 5/21/11 Time of Sighting: 10:15 p.m. Location: Jackson, TN   At 10:15 P.M., on May 21, 2011, I was outside sitting on my back deck.  It was a clear and windless night. I noticed something out of the corner of my eye and looked up.  What I saw was extraordinary. The UFO was heading exactly due north at moderate speed.  I watched the UFO for approximately 10 seconds until it went completely out of sight.  I estimated the UFO was at a high altitude from 20 to fifty thousand feet. Description:  The UFO had at least a dozen to fifteen strings of solid, soft white lights that appeared to be along the front in a crescent moon shaped fashion.  I could not fully tell if the lights were attached to a solid body, or were separate entities flying in a bowed formation.  The lights appeared to be spaced equally apart along the front and were not blinking as with most aircraft.  I estimated the sixe from one end to the other to be at least several hundred yards long.  It was massive, but graceful. The UFO made no sound as it moved across the sky almost directly overhead.  There was no sound after the UFO passed either.  The speed was constant and it did not change course.  It stayed due north until it vanished out of sight. After I noted the time, I called the local police and made a formal report with a detailed description. I am a college educated, 49 year old male who works for state government.  I am married with children and live in a gated mid-class neighborhood.;35.6765889530092;-88.8264958779874
