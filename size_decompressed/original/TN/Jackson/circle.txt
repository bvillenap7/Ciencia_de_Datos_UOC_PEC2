Very shiny, stationary object over Jackson, TN;2008-10-28 07:40:00;Few minutes/in a car;Very shiny, stationary object over Jackson, TN This morning on my way to work, I was driving down Riverside Dr and the sun was shining directly on a shiny, almost mirrored, silvery object.   Only 1/2 of the craft could be seen at this point.  It looked circular and not very tall, more roundish and it wasn’t a small craft either.   The reflection  was very, very bright, there was a hazy attribute around it because the sky was 100% clear with no clouds but only 1/2 of the craft could be seen.   It was closer than what a plane would be flying over a city and it was very visible.  I didn’t see any markings or lights.  The object was NOT moving, it was completely stationary.   I turned left onto Taft Street and was able to view it again.  It was very shiny and silvery and still was in the same place and was not moving.   I had to turn left again onto Medow Street.  I looked back and it was GONE.  I pulled over into a parking lot and searched the sky and it was not there.   I proceeded to State Street and kept looking and it never appeared again.;35.6765889530092;-88.8264958779874
Three Orange hovering balls in West TN.;2013-09-18 19:00:00;5 minutes;Three Orange hovering balls in West TN. It was dark and I was leaving the house to go to the grocery store.  At the end of my street is a stop sign.  You can either turn right or left, and directly ahead of you is nothing but dense woods and trees.  Marshy land mostly.  There are no cell towers or street lights in that direction.   I was at the stop sign and noticed 3 orange lights above the trees.  They were very, very low so I knew that it was not a plane. Or any kind of aircraft for that matter. They were simply hovering.  They emitted a red orange glow and they were not in a straight line.  One sat above the other two.   I sat for probably about 5 minutes and just watched.  They never moved.  I thought that maybe some towers has been built back there and they were just now lighting them up this evening, so I went on to the store.  When I came back I made sure to look and they were gone.   I turned on the road that went down behind the wooded area and drove around for several minutes and there was nothing. I even got up and left the house the very next morning just to check and there are still no towers, no street lights.  Nothing but trees and woods.  I still believe to this day that I have seen something that is not of this world.;35.6765889530092;-88.8264958779874
