White Flashes over Hwy 70 Jackson TN;2009-09-22 15:05:00;2 seconds;White Flashes over Hwy 70 Jackson, TN On Tuesday, September 22nd, at 3:05PM Central Time, I was going home from work in Jackson Tennessee on Hwy 70 towards I40. I saw 3 bolts of white light shoot across the sky from the East to the West. They looked like lightning, but they were perfectly straight. The sky was cloudy, but there was not any adverse weather. It was about 80 degrees out side. One followed by the other two. I think the person behind me saw it as well. I believe it was between 150 and 200 ft above the ground. It was almost as if the object left a trail, but the trail disappeared immediately. I tried to call the local airport when I got home, but there was no answer.;35.6765889530092;-88.8264958779874
