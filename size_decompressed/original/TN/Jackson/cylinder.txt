I was watching a star? west of st. hwy. 45 near Northside H.S.Madisdon cty. Tn.I had noticed the star,planet, whatever,3 or 4 weeks earlier. It would appear low,say 10 or 15 degrees above the horizon,10 minutes or so before dusk, it moved s. to n. each night,it would descend slowly,and disappear from sight in 10...15,minutes. On this night however it didn't descend,it seem to go out.I started shining a 2-million candlepower spotlight at the last positon I saw it at. I got a reflection, I then signaled it by turning the light off/on several times. After doing this a few times a cylinder shaped object,w/blinking red,green lights appeared in a vertical positon spinning on its on axis. Then an orange colored object cylinder shape,vertical positoned moved in from a n. to s. direction. It seemed to be between my position and the first object. It was in a tilted positon,say 5,or 10 degrees. I was quite startled by these events,I turned the spotlight off and went inside.I did not look  outside any more that night. I am a 46 year old male.I am an Industrial,New construction Electrician by trade.I had not been drinking or whatever these nights or this one in particular.;35.6765889530092;-88.8264958779874
very fast, silent cylinder seen with swirling red lights on its ends.;2008-12-30 03:45:00;10-15 seconds;very fast, silent cylinder seen with swirling red lights on its ends. At 3:45 am this morning, dec. 30, 2008, I witnessed an objected in the sky to the south of my backyard.  I was outside smoking and watching highflying planes flying from west to east, I like to watch planes late at night coming out of Memphis or going into Memphis to land. This morning though while watching two jets that were miles away and could only barely be seen an object with swirling (the only way I can describe them) red lights on it’s ends swooped through my field of view. It was a cylinder but flying long ways, not straight along its axis.  It had to be less than a half-mile away and was very fast yet silent. I could see it’s outline and could tell it was under control of something, it was flying with a pourpose and not just falling or streaking through the sky.  It seemed to make a sloping turn during the short time I saw it. It flew behind a tree in my backyard and did not emerge on the other side.  I scanned the sky for a long time afterwards looking for it but never saw it or anything similar again. Over the past 5 years I have nightly gone outside to smoke, since I don’t smoke in the house.  I have seen hundreds of airplanes and helicopters fly over and numerous shooting stars, but this time I saw something that I could not explain as any sort of conventional aircraft or a meteorite at all.;35.6765889530092;-88.8264958779874
