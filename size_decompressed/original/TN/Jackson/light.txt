Observation of four unexplained lights rotating in the sky.;2003-05-24 23:00:00;unknown;Observation of four unexplained lights rotating in the sky. My husband walked outside to move our vechicals for the night and looked up to check the weather.  He called me out.  There were four lights moving in a cicular to ellipe shape semi pattern.  The lights kept moving, but there did not appear to be any pattern.  At times it looked like two of the lights would almost touch and then bounce away from each other.  At the time of this writing, we have observed the sighting for about 35 minutes.  I did call the police to see if they had any idea what was going on.  They had not had any other reports.  We still have no idea what it was.  If you do find out, please email us back and let us know.  thank you;35.6765889530092;-88.8264958779874
Night sky lights up entirely for brief moment then returns to normal with no explaination.;2006-06-10 00:45:00;Instant;Night sky lights up entirely for brief moment then returns to normal with no explaination. I was in the passenger side of a vehicle, parked to the side of a gravel road, in the middle of nowhere. The driver and I had been parked there for about 1 hour. It was shortly after midnight on a cloudless, moonlit, night. Directly outside the passenger window, about four feet away, a medium height, wire fence, ran parallel to the vehicle. Beyond the fence is an open meadow for about 150-200 yards and after that a distant treeline. There is a single tree, approximately 25 feet high, visible to me through the passenger window, about 50 feet ahead of the vehicle and 40 feet behind the fence. I was looking out of the passenger window. Instantly, the entire world lit up, plain as day. all around. I could see everything, in bright color, as if the noon sun were shining. This may have lasted one second at the most. I don't remember if I could tell where the light came from as it happened, but afterward I could. It was like when someone takes your picture in a dark room. You have the after image of the flash in your eyes. You see purple and red and blue spots for a few seconds and then they're gone. Well, after the flash I could see a large after image, further into the field than the single tree, and higher in the sky. It lasted for about three seconds. The after image itself resembled a prismatic tear in open space, stretching about 45 feet in length, and about 30 feet off the ground. The image got smaller every second it lasted until it vanished all together. There were no sparks, smoke, thunder, flames, heat, sound, electric equipment around, no power lines, no way to explain it away and it left no traces that I could see. It was not particularly scary, but it was definitely intense. As soon as we could gather our wits we left. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.

moving light/box shape object;2008-11-22 03:18:00;12 minutes;moving light/box shape object 11/22/08 3:18 am and 11/23/08 3:45 am Because I had seen a very unusual chemtrail on 11/17/08 going from horizon to horizon (east to west) in a cloudless sky at around 3:15 am, I have been checking the early morning sky at about the 3am hour every morning since. 11/22/08 3:18am  - bright light low in eastern sky that I assumed was the “morning star” until it started moving erratically. Considered cloud coverage (minor coverage) and used a tree top silhouette for reference point. Light was defiantly moving in no set pattern. After watching for approximately 5 minutes, light took off at an angle and high rate of speed, disappearing in a few seconds. Within 5 minutes, a large object that was box shaped with slightly tapered ends, red and green lights in the back half of the object passed over my house. I assumed that it was a large helicopter – possibly a “Huey”, but the object appeared to be around  maybe a couple of hundred feet up but there was no noise at all, no vapor trail, no rotor wash. 11/23/08  3:45am.  Same bright light witnessed at very close to same point in sky. No clouds. Did not see box object.;35.6765889530092;-88.8264958779874
