Daytime sighting above Jackson, TN, of cigar-shaped metallic object flying north over I-40.;2015-03-15 12:50:00;1 minute;Daytime sighting above Jackson, TN, of cigar-shaped metallic object flying north over I-40. Daytime sighting. I was driving east on I-40 towards Jackson, TN.  I saw a silver metallic object move across the sky from south to north.  At first I thought it was an airplane, but could not detect any wings or tail/rudder. Once the object was north of I-40, it appeared to make a turn to the west.  Light from the sun reflected off the object to confirm that it was metal without any paint on its surface. Since I was driving, I had to look back down at the road to direct where I was going.  When I glanced back up at the sky, the object was gone.  The sky was completely clear, no clouds whatsoever.  I searched the sky to see if it had continued west, but I could not see it anywhere.;35.6765889530092;-88.8264958779874
Lights over Jackson, Tennessee.;2016-12-27 15:00:00;23-30 seconds;Lights over Jackson, Tennessee. I was at work at  scrap yard at Jackson Tennessee. We had two garbage trucks from Waste Management that we were taking  the garbage compartment off of the back of the truck to cut up and process for scrap.  We had finished the first one and were walking to the second one, when what at first I thought was a row of ducks or geese caught my eye.  I thought that I had never seen birds flying that high before.  Then I noticed they werent birds but lights that were wagging up and down or in a circle pattern.  There were twelve or fourteen of them in a single line and they kind of faded out from view then reappeared.  There were three other people with me and I pointed up and hollered HEY! LOOK!.  I could tell they were all attached to something but I could not tell what the shape of it was but it was as big as a couple of train rail cars.  As i was pointing at it, it faded from view again, and I didn't see it again.;35.6765889530092;-88.8264958779874

I noticed a silver/metallic cigar-shaped craft near the 45 bypass and Vann Drive area.  It was moving very slowly and did not appear to be an airplane.  There were no wings, no propellers, and it moved very slowly.   The sky was completely clear and I was parked where I had a good view of it.  It headed South West.;35.6765889530092;-88.8264958779874
