Three glowing spheres under dark triangular shape, no sound;2000-10-01 22:00:00;appox. 2 mins;Three glowing spheres under dark triangular shape, no sound On or around Sept. close to dusk, myself, four other adults and two children witnessed an object (or objects) passing overhead. We saw three bright white-yellow glowing spheres moving south-west in a triangular pattern beneath a dark shadowy triangular object. The spheres seemed to move independently of each other and of the dark object above, yet maintained position. The objects seemed only 500-600 ft above us and appeared very large. They moved slowly and completely silent as they passed over us. We watched as they moved at this slow pace for some time. Then instantly it accelerated and seemed to disappear.

Black triangular aircraft with 3 lights hovering above hotel roof.;2017-10-25 03:00:00;3 minutes;Black triangular aircraft with 3 lights hovering above hotel roof. Wednesday morning around 3 am I got a call from a friend of mine while I was at work telling me to go outside and look up.  When I went out she was already outside looking up with a shocked dumbfounded look on her face.  I could even see cars pulled over on the main highway staring up.  I looked up and saw a large black aircraft with 3 lights shaped into a triangle hovering less than 20 ft from our roof.  It stayed there around 2-3 minutes before flying off.  It made no noise at all and was about the size of 2 jets.  Still checking the news in our area to see of anyone reported it.;35.6765889530092;-88.8264958779874
