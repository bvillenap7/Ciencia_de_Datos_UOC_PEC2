A flash of light that was extremely bright got me looking at an object that appeared to be moving very slow.I thought it was a plane at first,but I'm not sure.It looked more like a disc shaped object moving to the east.I cut the mower off and could not hear a thing.There was even a jet much higher than this object coming south to north and I could not hear it either.I watched the object for maybe another 20-30 seconds.I then started the mower back up and made the turn to go back the other direction,looked back up and it was gone.I even cut the mower back off and got off of it and done a 360-it was nowhere in sight.I have not told a soul cause I figured people would think I'm losing it...not even my wife.I did,however,want to report this,because I just don't know what it was.
