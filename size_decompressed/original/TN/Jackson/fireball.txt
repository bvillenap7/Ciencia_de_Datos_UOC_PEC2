Two fire balls in Jackson, TN;2012-09-09 19:05:00;10 minutes;Two fire balls in Jackson, TN I witnessed a fireball travelling southwest for quite some time before finally fading out of sight and I tried to capture on video, however I couldn't.  But shortly after the first, a second appeared and I caught that one on video while talking to a friend on the phone during the whole experience.  It looked like a meteor but had a relatively short tail and lasted much longer than anything I've seen before.  It faded out of view before it burned out, not that it did.  It was clear weather and clear skies in west Tennessee at the time.;35.6765889530092;-88.8264958779874
Orange fireball slowly moved across the sky at sunset;2020-12-17 16:46:00;10 minutes;Orange fireball slowly moved across the sky at sunset Just prior to sunset a coworker radioed that there was something burning in the sky.   When went to see a bright orange glowing object was moving from east to west at a speed that to me appeared to be standing still.  Two other objects were observed in line of sight but dismissed as aircraft.  It was not the object that I noticed when I looked but the change in color of the sunset.  I observed the sunset just a few minutes earlier before I had gone into a building which was a vivid gold color.  When I was called out to see the object the entire western horizon had been muted to a purplish grey haze.  After the object was no longer in sight (went below horizon) the bright vivid colors of the sunset returned.  Shape was oblong-globe with a short trail left behind.  Speculated that it was possibly a sayalite that had reentered the outer atmosphere  A coworker photographed the event at 16:46 hours, I photographed the sunset at 15:03 hours to show contrast between the grey horizon during the event vs the normal sunset after the event.;35.6765889530092;-88.8264958779874
