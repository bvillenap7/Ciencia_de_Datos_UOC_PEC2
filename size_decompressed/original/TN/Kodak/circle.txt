Flashing object;2003-09-17 22:00:00;30 min;Flashing object Seems like same description as report in NC.  Very bright, flashing, red/blue pulses.  Stationary for about 30 minutes then slowly moved further away and lower.  Looked through a telescope, saw a circle with a maze-like pattern inside, with a dark spot that randomly and chaoticly moved within.  ???????  Was this an optical illusion through the telescope?  Just a twinkling star?  But it moved! ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that a twinkling star is a possibility that would have to be ruled out, before we could conclude the witness had observed a genuine UFO.  PD));35.974;-83.6221999999999
