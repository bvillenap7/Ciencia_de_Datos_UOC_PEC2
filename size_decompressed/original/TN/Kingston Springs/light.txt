A LOUD NOISE AND BLINDING LIGHT AND THEN  A  ACTUAL ENCOUNTER.;2001-02-09 13:00:00;2 minutes;A LOUD NOISE AND BLINDING LIGHT AND THEN  A  ACTUAL ENCOUNTER. ON 02-09-01 AT 1:00 AM, I WAS JUST PREPARING TO GO TO SLEEP AND I HEARD A VERY LOUD NOISE OVER THE HOUSE, I THOUGHT IT WAS A VERY LOW HELICOPTER AND WHEN IT DIDNT GO AWAY THEN I LOOKED OUT MY WINDOW AND THERE WAS A BLINDING LIGHT AND THE NOISE WAS SO DEAFENING THAT I HAD TO COVER MY EARS BECAUSE IT HURT SO MUCH. THEN THE NOISE JUST SEEMED TO DISAPPEAR SUDDENDLY, THERE WAS NO FADING AWAY,IT JUST WAS GONE. AND THE LIGHT WAS GONE AS WELL. THE SAME MORNING AT 5:00 AM I WAS SUDDENDLY AWAKEN WITH A STRONG PRESENCE OF SOMEONE GETTING INTO BED WITH ME..I FELT THE HEAT NEXT TO MY BODY. I COUDNT MOVE, NOT BECAUSE I DIDNT TRY BUT I WAS PARALIZED. A FEW MOMENTS WENT BY AND THEN THE BLANKET STARTED TO SLOWLY COME OFF MY SHOULDERS. I STILL COULDNT MOVE. THE NEST FEW MOMENTS I WAS TERRIFIED TO NO END. THEN THE NEXT THING I REMEMBER I WAS WAKING UP AND IT WAS DAYLIGHT. I KNOW THIS WAS NO DREAM AND SOMETHING DID HAPPEN TO ME THAT EARLY MORNING. THANK YOU FOR THIS SITE. I FEEL SO ALONE AND WANTED TO TELL THIS TO SOMEONE THAT MIGHT BELIEVE ME. I NEVER REPORTED THIS TO ANY OFFICIALS.;36.0955;-87.1098
