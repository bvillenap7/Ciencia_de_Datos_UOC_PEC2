I saw a bright intense round light that  was above the tree line about 100 ft in the air.  It appeared for 3-5 seconds.   It dropped behind the trees with no sound.  It was brighter than any light but had no halo. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) It was 10:00 pm. It look like the ball went straight down behind the 50 ft tall trees but as my 15 year old son pointed out , it probably headed north  away from me which looked like it headed down because of it's relationship to the trees.
