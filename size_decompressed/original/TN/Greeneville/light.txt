The bright moving lights ranged from very low to where you would normally see a helicopter fly. The movements were very fast, back and;2011-09-10 23:44:00;2 hours+;The bright moving lights ranged from very low to where you would normally see a helicopter fly. The movements were very fast, back and fourth motion, and up and down.  They looked as if they were following our car but the were flying within a 5 mile radius in those directions, rather than moving away. we are observing them and used binoculars. they have a blue bright light in them can stay stationary and move rather quicky.  The blue light looks like it streaks down at times.It also looks like it has lights around it.   When looking without binoculars you can see a bright white light with a little dot, the light looks circular and some are brighter than others.  We have observed the same thing on many occasions but have never reported them.  I would say this has occured three times in the past two months. We got off interstate 81 at exit 23 and began seeing them, we can walk outside and still see a couple we live near Afton/chuckey, tn near the 11-E bypass.;36.1894517241379;-82.8441724137931
