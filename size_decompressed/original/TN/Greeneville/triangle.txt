Objects shoot laser beam toward one another-disappearwith loud boom. In spring or summer of 1980, mysister, cousin and I were on my grandmothers front porch, sitting on her swing. Across from her homewas a very large, empty field.Suddenly, the three of us lookedup to find two large, silvery,triangular shaped objects withlights along all sides. Theobjects were about 100 feet or soabove us, over the field.They wereclose enough that we could seedetails on the craft. The two objects hovered silently for about30 seconds, then something verystrange happened. Each of theobjects shot a laser beam out thefront towards one another. (theywere facing each other) Just asthe two laser beams touched, the objects disappeared with a very loud boom! This event was sounusual, that I've thought about it every day since then.;36.1894517241379;-82.8441724137931
