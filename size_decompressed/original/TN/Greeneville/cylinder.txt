Silver metallic craft.;2013-10-06 16:00:00;5 minutes;On Sunday October 6, 2013, a co-worker and myself were standing on the porch looking in the sky, because a single engine biplane was overhead.  The biplane was making an unusual sound that wasn't familiar to me.   While I was watching that biplane, to the right I noticed a very bright silver metallic craft.  My co-worker said what is that?  I replied, I had no idea.  It was moving in a circular motion towards the clouds.  It had some sort of wings/blades on the craft, but I never have seen anything so bright or shiny silver in the sky, and I never saw anything move that way.   The craft then moved off into the clouds.   My co-worker and I work with mentally handicapped people, and we have no experience with aircraft.  We were just looking at the sky.  There was no sound from the craft.;36.1894517241379;-82.8441724137931
