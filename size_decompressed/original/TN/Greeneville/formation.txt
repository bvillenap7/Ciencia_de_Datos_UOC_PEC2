I am 34 year old male truck driver wjo has a college degree.   I was outside playing with my two children with toy guns.  I pretended to get shoot and was on the ground looking at the sky an object that was stationary over my back yard that was really brilliant whitish golor.   It started moving after 30 Seconds and it was going southwest and then a second object came into view.   I yelled at my wife who before this started went to go get my kids some drinks in the house.  She did not hear me.   The 2nd object was going around the center object really fast and both still going southwest finally  just blinked off and I could not see it anymore.;36.1894517241379;-82.8441724137931
