Fast moving double lined craft with moving lights..left a rotating movement within a trail;2012-03-09 21:00:00;two minutes;03/09/12 Geeneville Tn. 21:00 fast moving double lined craft with moving lights..left a rotating movement within a trail On March 9th at 9 p.m. Eastern standard time I was out watching the sky again, as I do every night between 8:45-9:15. I have been taking pictures of ‘flashes’ in our night sky for several years, and while at first they were thought to be airplanes, the activity was strange.  The would be eight to ten flashes all over the area and would travel  in every direction in the same area of time. (and each night it was the same time)The rest of the night (anyway when I’d check) there is nothing. There might not be  anything for weeks or months and then maybe once or twice during a month it would be there again .However since last Oct. it has been almost every night (recently the amount may dwindle to a couple a night rather than what has been ). It was the same for Oct. through Dec. the year before, almost every night. The images I get after having to enlarge the tiny image that comes out on the back of the camera are amazing. They sure are NOT airplanes!!! I have hundreds upon hundreds of different things. I have also gained much knowledge from watching them over the months. I’d heard that the atmosphere can cause ‘images’ to be colors but they are really white. NOT true. I have two in the same picture and one is totally colorful while the other is white. On March 9th I captured on ‘still shot’ a whole series of pictures of a moving UFO. What it turned out being  is the same image as I’ve have in many pictures over the months. THIS time I have it ‘moving’ so I now know it has propulsion. I have a Nikon D 300 VR camera with a VR 70-300  Nikkor lens. I have the camera placed on a heavy vibration controlled tripod and use a shutter release cord. I was caught off guard when instead of flashing lights I saw an object careening downward from the East going South and it isn’t ’way up’ in the sky (as the others also haven’t been).  I could see the trail of fast moving ‘air’ behind it and the air rolled around within the trail.  It did not look or stay like a contrail. I could see the image but it was moving so fast I couldn’t make out what it was until I looked back on the camera.  There facing me was an image I recognized from the many pictures I already have like it. It ended up going to another area of another image in the sky.  The pictures were taken anywhere between 2-12 seconds apart, as in some I had to swivel the tripod head to find it again. The lights within it change position but that too is like other images of that same type I have., Sometimes the line formations are red…green…white…orange..and even blue. Sometimes double ,often single. ((NUFORC Note:  We have not been able to look at all of the photos submitted by this witness, but the several we have viewed look to us to be aircraft, or other normal objects.  We have not seen yet what we consider to be a genuine UFO.  PD));36.1894517241379;-82.8441724137931
