Silver Sphere in southern sky over Greeneville.;2014-09-29 18:30:00;12 seconds;Silver Sphere in southern sky over Greeneville. My wife and I saw a sphere in the sky approx 25000 ft  (About normal commercial aircraft traffic alt.) I had been watching a few jets in the sky, when I asked my wife if she was seeing what I saw.  It was a silver Sphere.  No jet stream as the other jets were leaving. No sign of lights, wings or fuselage.  It seemed to just sit for a few seconds and then disappear straight up into the sky.;36.1894517241379;-82.8441724137931
