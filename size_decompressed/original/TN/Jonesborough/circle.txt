I try to keep my eyes in the sky because i thought i saw something like it a couple weeks ago. as I turned onto the Rd, I saw a solid whit light standing still and flickering just a bit.  Didn't thank much of it but fr some reason i kept watching it.  Next i thought i saw it move about 3 inches in the sky so I asked my Fiancee to pull over.  She stopped the car and I got out watching it and it started to move towards my house.  There is an airport which would be behind me about 25 miles.  So I had her turn off the car to see if maybe we could here an engine or anything.  No sound at all coming from this craft.  So I got in the car and basically followed it as it was headed towards my house.  The Rd I live on is a staight away for about 12 miles.  When we got to the house I got out and it had stopped as it looked like it was probably 7 to ten miles away and maybe 100 Feet in the air.  So I continued to watch this object, as it was sitting still.  When I found the craft in my telescope it was a circle and looked like individual solid white lights all around it. So basically it was a circle of lights that looked like it was barely flickering. I went in the house to get a better lens for my telescope and it was gone when I got back but stood still for approximately 35 minutes.  I got home tonight at 9:00PM and there was a light in the same spot as I watched it for about ten minutes.  I went in to get my telescope because I took it in because I never thought t would be back.  When I got outside it was gone..  I would appreciate if anyone else that has been watching this object would give me some feedback.;36.291;-82.5001000000001
