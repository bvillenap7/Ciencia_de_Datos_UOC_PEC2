Unusual light moving across the sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Overflight of International Space Station.  PD));2016-06-15 21:45:00;3 minutes;Unusual light moving across the sky. At approximately 9:45 pm I saw a light moving across the sky from a north to south direction.  When I first saw the object I mistook it for a bright star.  It was white and moved across the sky at a moderate rate of speed (much too slow to be a meteorite).  There is an airport nearby, so I see planes almost every night.  Normally a plane has flashing lights and has the usual jet or propeller noise.  This object was completely silent.  It did not flash or change color.  I cannot estimate its exact speed or altitude.  Its speed was not unusual.  It moved in a straight line and exhibited no abnormal changes in direction.  It appeared to be flying fairly low in the sky, much lower than most conventional aircraft that I regularly observe.  I cannot claim that this was a genuine UFO, but I have never seen a conventional aircraft that looked like a bright white star.  It was low enough in the sky that I should have heard some sort of engine noise.  Again, this obje! ct was completely silent.  I did not have my smart phone or a camera with me, so I was unable to provide any documentation. ((NUFORC Note:  Overflight of ISS, from 2138 to 2143 hrs. local time.  See www.Heavens-above.com.
