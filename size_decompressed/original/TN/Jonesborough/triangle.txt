Low flying, triangular UFO with lights over Jonesborough Tennessee;2007-07-24 21:50:00;30 seconds;Low flying, triangular UFO with lights over Jonesborough Tennessee Tonight is a rainy night with low cloud cover.  I was driving a back road close to my home when I noticed a bright light just above the tree line to my left.  As the aircraft passed the trees and was in clear view I noticed that the object was triangular in shape.  It had a bright white light on the front and 4 evenly spaced white lights on the back.  The lights did not project a beam like a landing light will often do, and the lights were a clean white versus the yellowish tint associated with an incandescent light.  The aircraft itself must have been black because I could not make out the shape against the dark clouds other than the shape that the lights produced.  I estimate that it was approximately the size of a commuter jet from front to back, but it was definitely not a commuter jet.  It was moving from east to west at approximately 40-50 miles per hour and at an altitude of about 2000 feet at the most.  I did not notice any strobe or other colored lights associated with commercial aircraft.  I also was unable to hear any sound, and I had rolled my window down to see if I could hear anything.  I turned around in a driveway to follow it and see if I could get a better look and by the time I got back on the road it had apparently sped up enough to get out of my sight or had gone into the clouds.  With the weather being pretty bad, it was very unusual to see an aircraft of this size and altitude in our area, and it did not look like any conventional aircraft that I have seen before.;36.291;-82.5001000000001
