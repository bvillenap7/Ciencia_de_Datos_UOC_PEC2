Heard popping sound.. then looking up, saw glowing ball above cigar shaped object.;2017-05-21 13:00:00;5-10 minutes;Heard popping sound.. then looking up, saw glowing ball above cigar shaped object. On May 21, I [a State HVAC contractor] was visiting a friend who owns an International Security firm.  We were at his home, just outside Jonesborough Tenn., when sometime in the afternoon as we were chatting, there was a popping sound above us.  Looking up we saw a small white light.  I say 'we', but he saw it first.  It was so small, it took me a few seconds to locate it. It didn't appear to be moving, so I grabbed my small 10x25 binoculars and focused in on it.  There was a shiney ball-shaped object that seemed to pulsate light, and under the light was a cigar shaped object that was pointing down, approxamately 30^ angle to the left.  There would be a pulse of light and the CS object was then pointing 30^ to the right.  These pulses occured approx. 3 seconds apart, with the object moving from one angle to the other, with each pulse. The distance of the CS object from the glowing mass was about 1/4 the length of the CS object.  The CS object itself was about 4-5 times the length of the lights diameter.  Other than its rounded ends, the body shape was constant.. like a cigar. It was difficult to guage how high it was, and it didn't appear to be decending.  It moved slowly to the west, as if it were drifting.. always at the same hight.  The entire experiance lasted 5-10 minutes. After giving it thought, it could have been something that was dropped from a higher vessle and when reaching a certain altitude, metalic parashoots opened.. which would acount for the 'popping' sound. The shifting degree's of the cigar could have been a 'swinging' motion, IF it was hanging.  Sunlight bouncing off metalic shoots could give the appearance of pulsating, stabalizing rockets, even though I've never seen or heard of 'metallic' para-shoots. Whatever it was.. it was pretty cool to watch!  Was there anyone else in the area that reported this?;36.291;-82.5001000000001
