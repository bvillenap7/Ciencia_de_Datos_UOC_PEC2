On October 8,2009 at approximately 10:00 AM my wife saw a very large UFO over our house in Jonesborough, TN.  She described it as being very large (bigger than our house), white and shaped like a disk with dome shaped top.  It was not very high by her estimate (probable less than 1000 ft), it was almost motionless and it was silent.  Its edges were rounded instead of being sharp and there appeared to be something like windows around the bottom part. We left the house and about one-half mile away she saw it again.  She became excited and told me it was aliens.  I saw the object which I first took to be an airplane seen from the side, but it was motionless and silent.  I could not stop because another vehicle was behind me but I did see it as I drove to a place to stop.  We turned around and drove back to get a look.  We saw the object which was probable less than one-half mile away.  It went from being motionless to assuming a constant speed.  It did not slowly accelerate, it just assumed a speed or velocity. It changed course, moved away from us and quickly went to a distant point of light. Address 1 Address 2 Address 3 Phone Email;36.291;-82.5001000000001
