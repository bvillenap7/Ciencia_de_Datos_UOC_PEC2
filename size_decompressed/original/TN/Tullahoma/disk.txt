Up close and personal to a bright glowing disk while fishing at night;1974-11-04 20:00:00;15 minutes;Up close and personal to a bright glowing disk while fishing at night I was fishing with a friend on tims ford lake about 8 oclock at night and it was clear and the stars were showing and there was about 10 or 15 other boats in the area and this blueish lit craft came out over the water and i told the person with me to look at that and as i pointed at it it lite up brighter than the sun and took off across the sky faster than a bullet.   When i pointed at it i would say it was about a 100 feet from us and was so bright we had to look away from it and for a few seconds it lit the area about a 1/2 a mile around us so bright you could count the leaves on the trees and was 15 miles away on the horizon in less the 2 or 3 seconds.   Needless to say all those boats cleared the area and the people on the banks got up and ran for there cars and one man i talked to at the boat ramp told me it made the hair stand up on his arms   he said he could have hit it with a rock it was so close to him and the only sound it made was a swishing sound like you swung a bat throught the air.  There were all kinds of police reports made around the area of seing the same thing and a bright light also seen by the tullahoma police.   Let me tell you it wasn't anything from this planet and i won't ever for get it  i am 65 yo now i can say i saw it up close and personal and wish i had had a camera with me;35.3427425287357;-86.2079620689656
