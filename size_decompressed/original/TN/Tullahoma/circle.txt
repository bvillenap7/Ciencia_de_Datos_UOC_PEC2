At first I didn't think anything about it as helicopters fly in to our local hospital.  However this object flew close to the tree line and was moving really fast.  Was able to snap a few pictures while driving to catch up.  I turned on a road next to a funeral home and saw it suddenly stop in the sky and hover.  I took a video showing it just sitting there in the sky.  Then I got freaked out and drove away.;35.3427425287357;-86.2079620689656
