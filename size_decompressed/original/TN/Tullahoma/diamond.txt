UFO hovering over lake.;2008-04-20 21:15:00;2 minutes;UFO hovering over lake. I was driving home from work when I saw what I thought was a bright star in the sky. I looked at it, and noticed a red flash come from it. I stopped in the middle of the road, and watched the light but it wasn't moving. I was about to just start driving again when the red light started flashing again. I thought the only normal thing that it could be was a helicopter above the lake, so I kicked it to the lake to see if it was a helicopter. Helicopters have been known to land down at the lake to life flight a wreck victim from the bridge, so I knew how loud a helicopter would be so I lowered my window to see if I could hear something, but there was no sound. I crossed the bridge,(Neil's Bridge) and stared at what looked like a skinny long object with two long blue lights in the middle and a red light at one end and a white light a the other. I stopped on the side of the road when I was across the bridge, and watched the lights just sit about a hundred feet above the lake. I climbed out the widow to look over the roof of the car, and it flew off over the trees in the direction I had come from. Tullahoma! I then drove back towards town, but I could only see lights off in the distance. There were about four sets of red and white lights going across the sky, so I have no idea what I saw. I can only assume it was something from the air base that is about thirty miles from my house. I don't believe in aliens, so I believe it was something man made. Probably an experimental aircraft. Strangely enough, we had an earthquake while I was typing this.;35.3427425287357;-86.2079620689656
