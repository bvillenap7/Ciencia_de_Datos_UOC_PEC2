Even though you could see it with the naked eye, I watched it from my telescope. It was red,blue and white and kept changing shapes. It seemed to have an aura around it at times.It also appeared at one point to have some type of electric engery emitting from it.  We watched it move slowly left,right, up and  down. After almost an hour of watching it, it started to dim in color until it turned a gold color and then just disappeared from sight.We heard no noises of any kind.;35.3427425287357;-86.2079620689656
We are near an air force base however this was not a plane, helicopter or object that we know of.;2015-07-05 22:35:00;30;We are near an air force base however this was not a plane, helicopter or object that we know of. Right after sundown my husband was pulling our car into the garage and noticed a bright light to the west in the sky.  It was a hazy, cloud covered sky and with no at that time.  He came in the house to get his binoculars and then 5 min. later asked me, his wife, to come outside to look at something.  At first it appeared oblong with many lights that were a bright white in color, when looking through the binoculars.   However it started changing shapes and was moving to the right and then to the left and then started making maneuvers that were seemingly random, changing shapes and slowly moving closer, then farther away and making zigzag, circular and other shapes of movement.  After about 30 minutes it started getting farther away and was totally gone within 5 minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  We have amended the time of the sighting shown above.
