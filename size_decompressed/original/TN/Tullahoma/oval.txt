Reddish orange oval object that hovered over and dipped in front of my car during the 15 minute drive into town;1982-05-15 04:30:00;15 min;Reddish orange oval object that hovered over and dipped in front of my car during the 15 minute drive into town I was driving home after a long night of studying with my father.  He had rented a small home near Woods Reservoir Lake part of the Arnold Engineering Development Center Air Force Base.  My drive home is on a highway that cuts through the Air Force Base-it is all trees for several miles. As I reached the highway I noticed a red/orange glowing oval shaped object that hovered to my left as I drove and seemed to go with me.  Occasionally it would cross my path and dip in front of my car and quickly go back to the left and hover.  At first I thought I was seeing the reflection of my cigarette in the window and so I put out the cigarette and the object was still there.  It continued to hover and dip in front of me many times during the 15 minute drive.  As I reached the edge of town there is a large curve in the road and as I made the left turn on the curve the object flew above (instead of dipping in front of) my car, crossed over and to the right and disappeared over the trees to my right.  It was reddish orange, oval shaped and seemed to be brighter on either side of the object. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
