Lights forming a triangle in the sky;1980-08-08 20:00:00;coupla minutes;Lights forming a triangle in the sky I was taking out the trash, at night, as a child. I looked up through the trees and there was a point of light moving slowly at what seemed a great height.   I watched it grow higher in the sky and noticed two other lights were traveling towards it.  I would say the lights were like they were at the points of an equilateral triangle that grew smaller as they converged.    The lights stopped, forming a triangle in the sky about the width of six or seven full moons.  Then the lights went back the way they had come with out any noticable turning around.  There was no discernable noise. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting event is approximate.  PD));35.3427425287357;-86.2079620689656

We turned off our black lights and started looking up.  The objects in the sky were going from left to right, and making 90 degree turns.  Several glowing lights were seen moving towards the big dipper.  I dont have the camera equipment to look up that high, and my camera phone proved unsuccessful.  At one point it appeared to look like a laser fight in the sky that lasted for about 5 minutes then it all stopped.  It was scary enough for my son to have bad dreams regarding what we saw, and to have him not wanting to be alone or by himself at anytime today.  I just am not sure what it was that we saw, but am positive it wasnt any type of plane or anything similar.  Please come down and sit on the lake with the lights out...and prove to me we are not crazy.  Thanks so much.;35.3427425287357;-86.2079620689656
