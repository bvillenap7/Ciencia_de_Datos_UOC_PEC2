It was just before daybreak when I went outside.   As I was standing on my back porch, I saw a light that I thought was a star at first, then I figured that it was too bright to be a star, and it seemed way to close to be a star.  After a minute of watching, I noticed there were no red or green blinking lights.  Even more, I noticed that there was no noise coming from it that you normally would hear.  I began to video tape this on my cell phone.  As I recorded, I noticed that it was moving around very quickly from side to side.  During the recording, you can hear the neighbors dog howl twice.   I still do not know what I saw but I know it was not a normal aircraft that is used day to day.;36.3768;-87.1088
