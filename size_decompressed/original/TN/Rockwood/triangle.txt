Extremely slow moving triangle object with amber lights that were steady on.;2017-11-09 16:00:00;60-90 seconds;Extremely slow moving triangle object with amber lights that were steady on. My son and I was out walking our dog.  We were about two and half blocks from home.  We talking.  I looked up at an old home I really a like and saw a large triangle object, moving extremely slow for an aircraft almost directly overhead.  The object did not have a strobe light like other aircraft that come through our area.   The object continue to move northeast.  The object had amber colored light on the bottom.  Lines in a rectangler shapes could be in seen on the bottom and lite with the amber colored light.  There were also a few points of light on each corner and few scattered in the center.   We continued watching the object as we walked towards our home.  We lost full view behind some trees but could still see the lights.   Then we noticed some strobe lights in the area.  Once we could see the object fully we notice what seemed to be additional aircraft in the area (between 5 to 7) that all had strobe lights on them.  The object continued towards those airc! raft and moved slowly from our view.  Seeing the object from the rear, we noticed two large rectangles of amber light glowing. I am an accountant and my son is a nursing student.  We are not sure what saw exactly, but I was not what we would normally see.;35.8525;-84.6833
