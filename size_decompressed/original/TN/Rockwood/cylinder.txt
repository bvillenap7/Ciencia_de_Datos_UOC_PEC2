Long white cylinder shaped object seen over East Tennesee at 10pm on 10-29-15.;2015-10-29 22:30:00;5 minutes;Long white cylinder shaped object seen over East TN at 10pm on 10-29-15. At approx 10:00pm, I stepped out onto my patio, and immediately noticed a long forward slanting (in 1o'clock position) cylinder shaped, semi-bright large object, with no blinking..the object was going from N/E to South.   I first thought it was the International Space Station, as possibly seen from a side angle, but I couldn't find any info stating it was over my state at that particular time.;35.8525;-84.6833
