Dark, small metalic fluttering object.  ((anonymous report));2019-03-17 12:05:00;13 seconds;Dark, small metalic fluttering object I was driving on a country road, and there were a few farm houses nearby.  There were open fields.  About 50 yards from me and 30 ft in the air, was a shape that was dark and vibrating, or fluttering.  I first thought it was a bird, but then saw it shimmer, metalic.  It was small, about the size of a remote control plane, or a small drone, so I figured that is what it was.  I told my daughter what I saw, and she saw no one around, and reminded me we were in Amish country, where people don’t use devices like that.  As we passed by it, I saw it in my rear view mirror, and turned around to see it again, but it was gone.  It wasn’t a defined shape, but definitely wider then it’s height.  It was fluttering, or vibrating, and hovering.  It was shinny metal, and dark.  I have never before seen anything like this.
