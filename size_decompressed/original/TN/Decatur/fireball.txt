Tennessee- Meigs County- Decatur- Hwy 58â€¦  My son called me to come get him from ball game tonight,  while driving on our way back home about 9:17 pm, my attention was drawn to the sky,  We saw a round green to yellow ball falling from sky.  no tail on it, perfectly round, color went from green to yellow, no sound, no flash from it at all and as quick as it appeared it then disappeared.  While it only lasted about 15 seconds it was amazing.;35.5045;-84.8056
Saw an orange moving glow in the sky, and then disappeared.;2015-08-08 22:00:00;2 minutes;Saw an orange moving glow in the sky, and then disappeared. Standing on the porch amd looked up in the sky and first thought was a star but was orange, then noticed the object was moving and moving toward us and became closer and larger as it moved in our direction (southeast) and then just disappeared.   We did not hear any noise but should have because it appeared to be low enough.   This is the first time seeing anything like this.  It was certianly a UFO to us.  I would like to know what it was and where it went;35.5045;-84.8056
