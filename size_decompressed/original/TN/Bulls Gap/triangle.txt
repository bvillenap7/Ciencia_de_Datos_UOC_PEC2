Triangle grey orb spotted above our trees in Bulls Gap, Tennessee;2005-08-03 12:00:00;1 minute;Triangle grey orb spotted above our trees in Bulls Gap, Tennessee We often get military jets flying barely above our trees as we live on a mountain.  The military says they are doing low flying exercises.    This time my sons had seen a triangular flying grey object with no wings flying low right above the trees.  I did not see it as it sounded like a jet flying over and we seem to get them a few times per week.   They were adamant that it was shaped like a triangle.;36.2833;-83.0421
