Object seen on hunting trip.;2005-03-16 18:00:00;2-3 minutes;Object seen on hunting trip. My Father and I were hunting just after dusk when we saw the object. Object appeared roughly 80-100 yards away from us with the approximate size of a four wheeler from that distance.  Object made humming noise enough to hear, but not real loud. Object was stationary in the air about 300 feet (give or take) off the ground.  Both of us were baffled and decided to leave after we viewed it for a time. Turned to leave and turned back around to look at it again and it was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.
