Triangular Shape w/very bright orange light w/2 smaller lights seen on a rural road going home.;2016-10-17 19:30:00;1-2 minutes;Triangular Shape w/very bright orange light w/2 smaller lights seen on a rural road going home. I am a skeptic.  Still not sure what I saw and wasn’t going to report anything, but after reading about the siting in Gatlinburg not too long ago, I thought maybe I should report it. The time it happened was around 7:30pm in Cocke County on a rural road on October 17, 2016.   There were two lights in the sky.  One very bright (orange in color), the other seemed to be orbiting around it slowly at first.  I thought maybe it was just a satellite and a planet because I am a big star gazer and can identify different objects in the sky fairly well. I kept watching and as I drove close the one very bright star got brighter and there was a third star that appeared which made the triangular shape.  I gasped because the shape was slightly darker than the rest of the sky. The size was unmeasurable.  It was so big.  I have seen a lot of planes fly through our small part of the woods, but nothing like this. My heart sank.  I was so frightened.  It only lasted a moment, and the lights faded leaving only the bright star and the first smaller star dimly lit in the night sky. As I drove, the tree line took over my view.  I kept watching and calculating where the object or stars…things would be in the sky when my car turned in that direction again, but I was unable to locate it.
