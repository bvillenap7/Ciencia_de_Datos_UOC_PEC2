Went to work told boss truth why we were late got sent out for drug test By 1 pm all of us were blisterd like we sat in the sun for hours and one of co-workers got real sick like flu and cunvulsions also cell phones had dead batterys 3 phones and passed drug test came back told boss we didnt see anything it was joke got made fun of for days at work so we decided not to talk about it with anyone else.
