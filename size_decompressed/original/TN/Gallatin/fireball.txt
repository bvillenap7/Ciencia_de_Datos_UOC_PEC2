Very small, yellow/gold color, somewhat like the sun the way it moves when it burns, but was a solid light, not a blinking light like an airplane light. The tail of it came out the bottom, kind of spiked in appearance. They would come as a cluster at one moment and then the next time would be one at a time, but closely following each other. At one point, they looked to make some sort of formation before the next bout would appear. Then they all stopped appearing.;36.3834;-86.4512000000001
