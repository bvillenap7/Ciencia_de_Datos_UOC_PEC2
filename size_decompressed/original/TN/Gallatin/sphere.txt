Launching bright red pulsing lights, that tracked across the sky;2013-02-14 20:00:00;<5 minutes;Launching bright red pulsing lights, that tracked across the sky I sat on the back porch of my home, and saw a flash in the distance. After which a red light lifted into the sky.  After a short climb, it began travailing horizontally.  I watched it in awe as it tracked the sky until I couldnt see it from the vantage point behind the house.   ran inside grabbed my wife, and took her to the front to show her what I saw.   We both watched it track in the clear night sky.  It pulsated red and covered a tremendous distance until, it went so far that it became too small, and too faint to see.  This happened in a matter of seconds.  I then took her to the back of the house to show her the direction it lifted from, when another one lifted off right before her eyes.  She went inside, and I watched it track in the same manner as the first.   Then it cut in the opposite horizontal direction and took off at an even faster speed than the first. Neither of the objects made any sound.;36.3834;-86.4512000000001
