The color and shape of the object was unlike any aircraft that I have ver seen. It was cylindrical and was a mettallic silver. The sun was shinging brightly without any cloud cover whatsoever. I stopped my car and got out. The object was moving very slowly over a wooded area where some new homes are being built. The object was about 1,000 high in the sky. It made absolutely no sound. All of a sudden it just disappeared-that is the best way to describe how I lost sight of it. I was driving out to my new home in a new subdivision on the north side of Gallatin, TN around lunch time. I was going up a small hill-side road when I saw an object flying slowly in the sky about a quarter of amile away from me. It was a cloudless sunny day and this object did not cast any reflection in the sky. It was a bright mettallic silver cylindrical shaped object. It was flying very slowly and was almost hovering over a wooded area where workers ,who were at lunch , have been building a new road into this secluded subdivision. I turned my car off and stepped out of my car for a better look and to see if it might be an airplane.  The object made no sound. Nor did it leave a contrail. Within about 10 seconds later, the object disappeared right before my eyes. That is the best way to describe how it left my sight of view. I am a 37 year old white male.
