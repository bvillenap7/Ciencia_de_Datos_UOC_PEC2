Circular objects, bright, reflective, appearing then vanishing.;2013-09-05 19:00:00;30 minutes;Circular objects, bright, reflective, appearing then vanishing. Driving home from work I spotted to my left a large circular object.  It was very bright and suddenly vanished.  It was not very cloudy at all, and it was still very sunny.  The object moved slighty and quickly before vanishing.  I scoured the sky trying to spot it once more.  Shortly after I turned on to another road I spotted it again.  This time it was smaller and in a different location.  I watched it as much as possible while trying to drive safely.  The object vanished once again.  I decided to pull over and try to record these objects but my cell phone camera could not clearly pick them up.  I spotted it two more times in different places.  They would move a distance and then vanish again.  There was an unusual amount of planes in the area as well.  Again these objects appeared round and very reflective.  Almost silver in color.  This isn't my first sighting like this in the Gallatin area.;36.3834;-86.4512000000001
