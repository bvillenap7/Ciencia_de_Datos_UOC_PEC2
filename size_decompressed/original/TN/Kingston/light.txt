16 Amber Lights Flying in a Straight Line Over Tennessee.;2012-01-01 01:00:00;30 mins;16 Amber Lights Flying in a Straight Line Over Tennessee. At approximately 1 AM EST 16 amber lights appeared in the skies over Kingston, TN.  The objects were moving from North to South at approximately 1-2 thousand feet.  They had a very bright orange glow that seemed to pulsate yet emitted no sound.  The lights were moving swiftly yet steadily possibly 150-200 mph.  The objects seemed to be in a large yet distinguishable line and did not deviate from that pattern.  At 1:15 AM I called the non emergency number to our county dispatch and reported the incident to the police.  I then walked to a neighboring house to get confirmation of what I was witnessing.  A pair of binoculars was used to view the lights.  While we were unsure of the exact shape of the objects, we agreed the general shape and size was around 50 feet long and seemed to be triangular but because of the glow we could not be sure.   AT 1:20 I called a friend who lived across town and asked them to go outside to look for the objects and he also confirmed our s! ightings.  One by one the objects blinked out and disappeared in the same general area.  This display lasted 30-45 minutes and was observed by 4 people that I know of 1 of which was a police officer.   The objects were not fireworks, blimps, known aircraft, weather balloons or flares.;35.8507;-84.4962999999999
