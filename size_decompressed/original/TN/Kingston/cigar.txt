We all noticed a cigar shaped craft really low on the water.  At first we thoight was a boat. Then it began to rise into the air to am estimated 60 ft height.  Then we noticed another cigar shaped craft come into view in the sky and lower into a hover over the lake.  The craft stayed in position over the lale for 10 to 15 minutes then began am ascent to match the other crafts height.  We all noticed water coming off the craft even though it clearly didnt touvh the water.  Which lead us to believe these craft were collecting water.  After 2 or 3 minutes the craft started lighting up in alternating color of green,red,blue.  They then bagan ascending slowly at first then just vanishes into space too high to see or just gone.;35.8507;-84.4962999999999
