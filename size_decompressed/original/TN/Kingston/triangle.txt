Triangle shaped object with lights hovering at the side of our house.;2003-11-30 18:55:00;3 minutes;Triangle shaped object with lights hovering at the side of our house. Since we moved here a year and a half ago, we have seen many strange things in the sky (lights, objects, etc.). Tonight there was a triangle shaped object with lights and no sound hovering over the trees on the far side of the house. It then started moving and came above the house and off to the east. Two of us watched this object glide directly over the house and off. The whole thing lasted about two to three minutes and then it was gone. There was absolutely no noise. I don't know what it was, but I know it wasn't an airplane, weather balloon, or anything like that. Very strange.;35.8507;-84.4962999999999
