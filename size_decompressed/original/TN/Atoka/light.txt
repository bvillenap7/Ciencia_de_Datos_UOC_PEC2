Light in the sky moving very fast and very high, then siz-zagging.;2014-05-26 21:00:00;90 seconds;Light in the sky moving very fast and very high, then siz-zagging. I was looking up at the sky at 9 pm on May 26 and saw a light moving south to north.  It was really high and moving very fast and I assumed it was a satellite, as I had seen them before with my naked eye.  However, this time, as it passed over me, it slowed down and zig-zagged.  I have never seen that before and then it shot off to the north very fast. I have seen lights in the sky, was able to see the international space station and have been able to identify everything I have seen, but this, this was different.;35.4393;-89.7804000000001
