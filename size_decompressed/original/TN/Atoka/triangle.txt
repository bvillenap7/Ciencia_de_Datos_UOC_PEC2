There was 10-11 orange UFOs in a V shape.  We tried to catch them on video, but they were too dim of a light.  Behind the V shape was about ten or eleven UFOs in random order.   We witnessed them disappear one by one as they passed by a water tower.   We have a video documenting the occurrence even though you can not see the UFOs.  I will not send the video because of explicit language.  I will show the video to an investigator.;35.4393;-89.7804000000001
