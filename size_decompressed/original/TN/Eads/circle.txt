Hovering sphere of white blue red lights over West TN.;2016-05-23 19:00:00;15+ minutes;Hovering sphere of white blue red lights over West TN. As I drove home from a group study on this evening...in the southern sky were a group of lights.  As I drove west on Highway 64 through Oakland, this round sphere of multi colored lights just hovered in the southern sky.  White, red, & blue lights were in a circular form in a layered formation.  White lights were interspersed with the colored lights.  White lights on top & bottom of the sphere.   It did not ever move as I traveled for about 6 miles due west.  Then I turned south toward my home & I could still see it.  Not having moved at all.  I arrived home in a couple of miles.  It was still totally still in the night sky.  Lights were present in the same form I had initially observed.  Very interesting.;35.1538;-89.6714
