Triangle object with bright lights hovering in silence.;2015-02-07 01:00:00;5 minutes;Triangle object with bright lights hovering in silence. Driving down highway 51 in Munford, TN, right above the water tower, me and my boyfriend saw a triangle craft of some sort with one bright white light in the center and a couple of smaller red lights at each corner of the flying object.   We thought is was an airplane until we realize how low it was flying or should I say hovering.  We pulled over and rolled the window down to get a better look and it was completely silent!  As soon as I got my phone out to try and take a picture it sped off faster than I have ever seen any aircraft travel.   We had never seen anything like it.;35.4611;-89.8163
