Copper colored triangle ufo over Cosby, Tn.;2018-01-15 17:00:00;3 minutes;Copper colored triangle ufo over Cosby, Tn. I was on the phone with my girlfriend who lives in Maryland. I was inside my second floor apartment and saw a copper colored glint of light over the mountaintop behind the apartment building and thought it was strange that it flew a curved path, causing the late afternoon sun (already down behind the mountain) to reflect off it.  I went outside onto the roofless deck and was continuing my conversation on my new Apple iPhone 7, which I was not very used to using as I only had it about a month. I was looking at the skies waiting for the plane I thought I had seen to re-appear.  I happened to look straight up into the sky and as I was doing so, the craft appeared out of nowhere. It was copper colored and had three white circular domed, downward facing lights. I screamed to my girlfriend OMG, it's a ufo! I frantically tried to get live video through the camera app, but being new to the phone, I was unaware that video is not possible while still frames are. I also did not know that you could use the power button to snap pictures.  As I watched, staring straight up at it, I saw that it was moving very slowly forward, the point with one light dome leading the way. After about 2-3 minutes, it simply vanished as I was watching it. My girlfriend stayed on the line the entire time so I should consider her a second witness, although not a visual one.;35.8375;-83.2219
