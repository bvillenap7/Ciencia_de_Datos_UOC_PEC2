2 Orange flaming orbs flying in the night sky.;2019-05-30 21:45:00;1 minute;2 Orange flaming orbs flying in the night sky. As I was leaving work when I noticed a bright light moving from west to east as I was facing the direction of south It looked like a flaming orb moving at about 300 mph and then I noticed another, so I managed to get my phone camera out and record the second one it was moving in the same direction and the same speed with no sound.  I estimate the altitude at 5000 feet.;36.3281;-81.9905
