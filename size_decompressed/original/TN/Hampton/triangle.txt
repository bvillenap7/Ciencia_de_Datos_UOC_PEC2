But it approached us from our left. Came across the highway. Crossed the hood of the truck and continued traveling to uor right. Before I describe this thing I must express the importance of our location. Hampton Tn is a small Appalacha town in the heart of the blue ridge Mtns very low populated. Where we were at it was grazing pastures and forrest. Even at this time of night there is not much traffic on the roads. What we saw was a reflection traveling on the ground. Triangle in shape, but this is the strange thing the reflection on the ground appeared glass like. It was sort of like in the superman movies wher the 3 super villians were taking away from krpton that thing that transported them. Very strange my son said we should report. I never would. Anyway here is this triangle reflection traveling on the ground cross over the hood and keeps going. So I got out to examine the area or to see if there was a logical answer for this there was none no house around to cause a reflection there are no trains in the area. The sky was clean. No helicopters in the air. It did not compare to a helicopter searchlight anyway because I know what they are like. Nothing if you could have seen this you would have said it appeared like watery glass.;36.2553;-82.1853
