Flashing Lights, Multi-color.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly a sighting of Sirius?  Just a guess.  PD));2007-04-04 21:00:00;45 minutes;Flashing Lights, Multi-color. I was outside with some friends.  When I saw a light flashing from white to blue to red, and moving in circular motions.   I saw three different objects.  One glowed very bright red and disappeared.  And another was flashing colors and slowly faded out.  Watched this event take place for about 45 minutes.   Another witness claimed he saw the object emitting a red beam.  One of the smaller lights flew into the bigger flashing light and finally disappeared.   All three of my friends clearly saw the same thing I saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly a sighting of Sirius?
