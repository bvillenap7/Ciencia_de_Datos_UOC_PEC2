Stationary Elongated UFO 200ft above vacant field with city lights on bottom;1992-10-10 20:15:00;1min. 39s;Stationary Elongated UFO 200ft above vacant field with city lights on bottom I was on the way home from a basketball game when, about three miles from my home, I was witness to what I call a UFO sighting.  We were traveling west on a heavily traveled, two lane highway when about four cars in front of us began to brake like and accident had occured.  When we approached the scene and slowed we noticed to the left of the highway only about 200 feet above a vacant field we saw a very long, possibly 300ft long craft, with a width of 80+ft and a height of 40-50ft. The botom of the craft had no super bright lights, however, it was illuminated.  Having lights that resembled looking at a city scape from above.  You could literlly see all of the botoom side of the craft as it maintained a staionary posistion above the field.  I could not beleive what we were seeing. There are two strange things about this sighting that I still struggle to understand today and I feel almost tormented from not knowing and the need to know.  #1 Everyone could see that this was not ordinary, yet the traffic only slowed to a crawl while people looked out their respective windows... no one stopped to investigate more intensly. #2 Although I wanted to talk about this with my mother, who was driving the vehicle, I couldn't.  Not because I didn't want to, but because I would think to myself I need to see what she thinks about this  and then when I would get near her to talk it was like it just was'nt in my mind to ask.  Hard to explain how that feels.  We didn't talk openly about what we saw for almost 7yrs.  Then one day we watched a program about UFO's with my father around 2000 and my mother says, Do you remember when we saw that ufo years ago?  I did and have always.  I just don't understand why we couldn't talk about it, like a block, for years. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));35.8697000000001;-83.7461999999998
