Huge neon green, brightly glowing ball of light.;2016-11-07 21:15:00;5 seconds;Huge neon green, brightly glowing ball of light. As I was driving down our road towards my house, it's a very dark road, something to  my left caught my eye.  When I looked, I saw a very brightly glowing, neon green circle of light (my son said it sounds like a meteor) falling from the sky, falling towards the ground.  There are untouched acres of hills surrounding the area with lots of trees.  It looked as if it fell into the trees. There was no sound at all, no spark of light as it may have hit the ground, NOTHING.  It just disappeared as it fell towards the ground.;36.1871;-86.0004
