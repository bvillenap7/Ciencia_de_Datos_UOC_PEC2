No matter how high in the sky it is, if I peek out my window, it sees me and comes down to see me as if it’s as curious about me as I am it.  If it rains, it does not come down.  It stays in the sky until dawn then disappears into the clouds.  The closest it’s gotten is about 25 yds.  I do not have a fancy camera so the films I’ve made in the dark from my phone is all I have.  It looks like a starfish but it glows.  There is something that follows along side of it and it doesn’t glow but moves with it.  When it moves it shoots out white light across the treetops and sky, it reminds me of heat lighting.  My husband has seen it many times and at first thought it must be a drone but now he’s not sure what it is.  One night I was lying in bed and it came so close that my hair was standing up on my crown.  My dog senses when it gets too close and starts growling.  When I tell people about it, they just laugh at me so I haven’t had anyone come see for themselves except my husband.  He has seen it but he is afraid it’s a drone.  This is not a drone, it makes no noise.;35.6387;-85.2115
