Object headed east/southeast.  There were no blinking lights.  The light emitted was a bright white light.  The object appeared to manuever up and down unlike any human-made craft that I'm aware of.  The velocity/speed was greater than that of a commercial aircraft based on my observations of commercial aircraft flight speeds from the ground.  The object continued its path heading east by southeast for a about 2 and 1/2 minutes.  Then it appeared to turn north by northeast.  At this point the bright white light disappeared.  What was amazing was that the white light was replaced by an orange fire-like color which lasted for a few seconds.  After that, the object disappeared as if it accelerated at an enormous speed.  There were no sounds that one would hear such as jet engines. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));35.1587;-85.2163
