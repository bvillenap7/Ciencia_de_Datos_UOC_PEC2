light mooving near moon in start and stop pattern.;2010-12-13 22:00:00;3+ minutes;light mooving near moon in start and stop pattern. A light was near the moon and was moving forward a bit, then pausing, them moving forward again, etc. It was a bright white light of similar magnitude to a planet.  It was moving at a fast speed and made no noise. Next day I noticed 2 Black military style helicopters flying in the general direction that the craft had traveled in the previous night.;35.1587;-85.2163
three lights like stars in the twilight after a fireworks display. The lights were uniform in color and brightness. Strange movement.;2013-07-03 22:02:00;~20 seconds;three lights like stars in the twilight after a fireworks display. The lights were uniform in color and brightness. Strange movement. UFO Sighting Report  On July 3rd, 2013 at approximately 10:30 PM, I was gathered with 4 other family members in Hixson, Tennessee after viewing the fireworks display provided by Camp Columbus.  It was an overcast evening and the display was inspiring.  The flying objects that we could not identify were southwest from our vantage point on the tent camping site 93 of Chester Frost Park. Two were on the same plain of approximately 40 degrees up from the horizon and one was higher at approximately 45 degrees.  The sun had gone down about an hour earlier so it is possible that the objects were reflecting the twilight.  The first thing that appeared odd to me was the uniform brightness.  Their color was also a uniform glowing orange.  There was no reference for distance but it appeared that the higher orb was at a greater distance.  It was stationary but the lower two were closer together and moved erratically as if re-positioning very easily.  I was watching very closely and my son in law was wor! king on getting his phone to take a video.  He could not see the objects on his phone display but he did record video where they might be found on a computer monitor.  I believe that the smoke from the display passed between the lower objects and our perspective but others in our party say that they instantly disappeared.  We all agreed that it seemed that the objects were admiring the fireworks display.;35.1587;-85.2163
Military helicopter chasing orange star type object over small suburb in Chattanooga, TN.;2015-08-21 00:17:00;3 minutes;Military helicopter chasing orange star type object over small suburb in Chattanooga, TN. At 0:15 I heard a very load helicopter.  I step outside to a cloudy dark moonless night.  So, trying to perceive the direction.  I quickly realized that it was directly in front of me moving toward me.   As I started watching the chopper which looked as a military black chopper moving very fast.  As it cleared the tree line 50 feet from me I could clearly see the chopper and the front blacked out, a red solid light on the left side and I beleive a green flashing light on right.  It was only 300 feet max probably 250 above me.   I'm no expert but I've lived 500 feet from a small airport behind my house and that was the direction they where flying.  At that point I realized that about 100 feet in front of the chopper was what I took as a bright orange star.  Silent and moving fast.   As the 2 flew over me directly, I had to twist my head, and spin directly behind, to watch the chopper chasing this star disappear over the tree line.  It was less than a minute that even the sound of this very loud chopper was gone.   I proceeded with a horrible headache.;35.1587;-85.2163
