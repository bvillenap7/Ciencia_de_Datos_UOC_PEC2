I observed a jet plane flying to the west with the beautiful tail that it leaves.   I then noticed a dime shaped object above it.  I wondered why this dime shaped object was not leaving a trail as the jet was.   The dime shaped object then proceeded to shoot to the Eastern sky at an amazing speed.   I am not an avid UFO person but when i saw what I did, I cannot dis what I had seen.   We are located near a nuclear plant in the Southeast and this concerns me!   Thank you for your kindness. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and she sounded to us to be quite serious-minded.  She emphasized the bizarre nature of the object, and the rapid rate at which the disc-shaped object accelerated, and streaked off.  We have invited here to attempt to find other witnesses in the Chattanooga area.  PD));35.1587;-85.2163
While arriving home we saw a large bright light above our home. It was huge, swaying side to side. ((NUFORC Note:  Venus??

We saw greenish lights around the object.  No sound at all. It changed shapes a couple times and would become brighter.  Then it just completely disappeared.  We took photos and video..;35.1587;-85.2163
