Triangular object with no lights gliding across the night sky.;2014-02-27 22:55:00;12 seconds;Triangular object with no lights gliding across the night sky At 10:55 EST in Hixson, TN, a suburb of Chattanooga, I was standing outside letting me dog out, when out of the corner of my eye, I saw what appeared to be a triangular object with no lights on it gliding across the night sky.  It was difficult to tell how high the object was, because there were no lights on it to help judge the distance but I would guess relatively low due to the fact that it was about 1/8 to 1/5 the size of a full moon.  There was no sound and it was traveling east south east toward the center of Chattanooga.  I observed the object for about 12 seconds or so as it flew out of sight remaining the same speed and direction the entire time. I've always been interested in looking up at the stars and own a telescope.  I have never seen anything like this before.  Since it had NO lights on it, it appeared a dark gray over the night sky.   I strained to get as clear of view as possible and could not make out any form of a plane or bird.  It definitely had a triangle shape.;35.1587;-85.2163
