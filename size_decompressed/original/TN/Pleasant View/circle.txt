Undeniable siting left me speechless.  ((Starlink satellites));2020-03-22 22:30:00;10 minutes;Undeniable siting left me speechless. I spotted  tiny circle of light way up drifting across the sky which is common for me, but tonight there was 1 right after another on same flight path each probably 200-300ft apart same speed and they didn’t stop for at least 10 minutes. All in a line. I counted at least 40, and while that was going on there was a couple I spotted going to opposite direction. I also see a big bright craft most nights, you can catch him flying in around sunset. He drifts slow but noticeable movement every night. I look up every night, and I’ve never seen anything this wild. My parents and daughter witnessed it, I called my boyfriend on the other side of town and he witnessed them as well. No way anyone can say it was planes, or satellites.;36.3781;-87.0360000000001
