Green oval glowing objects zipped across the sky.;2004-05-19 20:00:00;4 mins;Green oval glowing objects zipped across the sky. I was coming home after droping my brother at his house.  He lives a few miles up the road.  I was headed back home going SE.  I saw 2 green oval shaped glowing objects zipping back and forth.  They were going too fast to see the zipping but they would apear in front of and then beside me in the sky.  They were big like the size of a house in the sky.  I don't know what they were but I'm open to all possibilites (advertising lights, military crafts, airplanes, or UFO).  They did scare me because I know what advertising lights, military crafts, and airplanes look like (we live close to an army base) and I've never seen anything like this.  So I called my husband on my cell phone.  The closer I got to home I seemed to be going more towards them and then my cell phone went out.  As soon as I got home we went inside and stayed in for the night.  I don't know what they did after that because we were too freaked out to investigate and haven't seen anything since.  My brother's neighbor saw them from his house that night too but we've haven't heard anything on the news/or in the paper about it.  Of course now I'm the laughing stock of the family!;36.3781;-87.0360000000001
