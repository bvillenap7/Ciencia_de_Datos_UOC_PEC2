Very fast green ball low altitude know trail at all;2001-06-30 01:00:00;25 sec;Very fast green ball low alltitude know trail at all. Sorry I dont know how to use spell checker and my grammer isn't so good,but here it is me and a friend were walking up the road the night was clear as a bell I noticed there were at least four air planes, flying at different alltittudes in different directions you could tell easaly the difference but as far as the eye could see it was takeing them a long time after being in sight to leave it and then we seen it ,had we have not been looking up any way we might of missed it a big bright green ball of light at a lower alltitude than the air planes traveling at very high speed in a matter of around ten seconds it was gone ,no sound just gone it was at the time we were in irak I thought it seemed like a missle at the time but new it wasn't we talk about it from time to time but not much less than two weeks later we read in a news paper that some lady seen the same type thing a green ball of light but supposedly this one went into a hover near there home and picked up her dog and it wasn't scared her words ,{the dog acted like it had done it a thousand times }something like that .I know it sounds crazy I,m a skeptic but she said in the paper it glowed green.What we seen did to it moved very fast I dont think it was a comet it was silent at lower alltitude than any plane I could point the direction it went and if some one researched the lady whos dog was apparently picked up one might be able to triangelate its speed direction or possible point of impact I dont have a word processer so sorry its this way or not at all I can say I wish you were there and could have seen it .It was realy cool and it wasn't man made the size of a school bus but perfectly round. p.s no trail at all.

After fireworks were done we saw a red ball levitating and moving slowly in a line , then it dissapeared.  It was red and glowing.  It was also seen the same night about an hour away in Morristown.  I have a picture & 10 sec video but the quality is poor, however the person who saw it in the other town has a longer video with better quality and more photos.;36.4248;-84.0907
