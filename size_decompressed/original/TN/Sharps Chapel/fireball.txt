Crafts appeard July 3rd.They were distant,but very noticable.Red glowing objects in the distance. They made no noise.  Three of them constantly circling what seemed to be at least half a mile away.They would fade completely away at times,usually one at a time. Then they would reappear again in an instant,but would be nearer to us. As they got farther away each one would diseapear at a certain distance,then it would reappear back where it started from.  Each one would do this,the one farther away would diseapper and reappear at what seemed to be the same spot nearer tus.                                                                                          On the fourth as we sat on the deck of our houseboat we talked to our friends that were moored beside us on their houseboat.  The subject of the lights came up. They to had seen them too.As we talked they again appeard in the sky.  We watched in awe as the noiseless crafts flew the same pattern as the evening befo! re.Fireworks were going off again and thinking that everyone else was surely looking up and too were seeing these lights. Then in an instant one fireball broke away and in an instant was hovering above us.  The thing stopped nearly above us.None of us could make out a shape or determine the altitude of the craft, but it was there and both scary and intriguing.  Before we could get a camera or video recorder it went from hovering to an unbelievable left turn.It took only a millisecond and it was gone.                                                                                           On Norris lake in Tennessee we saw something unexplainable on July third and fourth.  There should be other eyewitness accounts,many were looking up at fireworks and should have also seen these fireballs.;36.3717;-83.8128
