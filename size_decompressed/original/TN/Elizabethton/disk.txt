Several craft at one time;2004-11-09 21:00:00;5 minutes;Several craft at one time My daughter, granddaughter and I were pullng in my driveway. My granddaughter got out of the car and started shouting for us to hurry and get out.  There was a long object with white lights on it in the western sky.  As we watched the object changed into two white lights and one red one and looked like a plane.  As it headed toward us, the glow of the lights made it easy to see that it was disc shaped.  At the same time there were lights in the northeast that looked like stars that were playing with each other.  Then  after the disc passed there was an object with three lights in formation that also passed directly overhead going in the southeast direction. There was no sound and it floated.  I have never seen so many different things at one time.;36.3445;-82.2015
