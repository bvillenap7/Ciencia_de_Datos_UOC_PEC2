As I got out I glanced at the mountain about 3/4 mile away. My house is also on a mountain, so I was level with the top of the other mountain.  There was a light, that looked like a very low plane.  As we watched, it bounced off the mountain and back in the air.  It was going very slow and made no noise.  We watched it bounce until we lost sight of it.  It was very strange.;36.3445;-82.2015
large bright white light;2004-11-03 22:45:00;1 minute;large bright white light My Aunt and I were going north. As we came to the intersection I noticed what I thought to be a low flying plane. It was a very bright white light. It went behind the trees on the mountain then came back out and took an arched dive. It landed halfway down the mountain.  The traffic moved and we lost track of it.  The electricity went out at the same time in a three mile range.;36.3445;-82.2015

They were orange colored lights 12-15 moving slowly.  They were too close together to be planes, and flying low with no sound.   People were stopping their cars on the street to watch them pass.  It was the most amazing thing I have ever seen. ((NUFORC Note:  Source elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.  PD));36.3445;-82.2015
Very bright and large orange star-like object moving at a steady pace NE bound.;2017-09-26 22:00:00;1 minute;Very bright and large orange star-like object moving at a steady pace NE bound I live in Stoneycreek and was watching the sky when I spotted coming from the W (heading NE) a very big and bright orange light, resembling a star.  It stayed steady on a linear path, staying solid the entire time.  I could tell it was pretty large.  I tried taking videos but my phone camera just wouldn't pick anything up.  It moved fairly slow, I'm surprised no one else has reported it.  Never seen anything like it.  I've also seen other strange things before this, like red/blue beams shooting through sky, and also lots of moving objects.  Lots of activity to the NE skies.   I've also began noticing square indentations on the back of my forearms.  Not sure if it's related, but strange considering they would stay for hours at a time and were most indented after waking.  There's nothing I would sleep on that would cause it, and it's always the same pattern, same spots.;36.3445;-82.2015

I'm ordering a camera with IR in hopes to catch some of them.  They seemed to react to me speaking to them, could have be a coincidence, though.  Some were red, orange, blue and could change colors.  All the dogs in the area were going crazy.   This is the first mass sighting I've ever seen, and it was just a couple days after seeing the bright orange light hover across the sky.  Will keep updating if I experience anything else.;36.3445;-82.2015
