UFO over Carter County TN;2011-08-29 23:20:00;10 minutes;UFO over Carter County TN Driving back from Elizabethton, TN to Stoney Creek TN, my friend and I saw a large circular white light in the sky at a distance.  We assumed it was a plane, or helicopter, or cell phone tower. However, it appeared to be moving.  The night was completely cloudless and we had a very good view of the object. At one point it looked like it was right beside us and very low in the sky.  I told my friend to pull over so we could see if we could hear helicopter propellors, but when we pulled over it disappeared suddenly.  We pulled back onto the road and continued for approximately 3 minutes when the object reappeared very far away in the distance near the mountains.  We know it was the same object because it was much brighter than any stars in the sky and seemed to be nearer to the earth.  Again, we seemed to get right under the object, but it completely disappeared and we didn't see it again.;36.3445;-82.2015
