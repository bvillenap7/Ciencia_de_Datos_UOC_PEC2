fast, bright, white burn of light, unbeliveable 90 degree turns;2002-04-12 20:40:00;3 minutes;fast, bright, white burn of light, unbeliveable 90 degree turns Please be advised that my husband and I witnessed an unidentifed flying object this evening at approximately 8:40PM over our home in Lynnville, Tennessee.  The object appeared out of the West moving at a blinding rate of speed.  It made an abrupt 90 degree turn toward the North then abruptly vanished.  It reappeared and made a 90 degree turn toward the West, vanished again, reappeared and moved toward the East, vanished again, reappeared and moved toward the North where it vanished over the horizen miles away.  The object was a bright, white burn of light, no other color was visable, no flashing light of any sort.  Our weather here tonight is low, dense cloud cover and this object was well below the cloud cover and made absolutely no noise.  I am very familiar with aircraft, helicopters, lightning and have a telescope and am very aware of stars, planets, comets etc.   This object was none of the above.;35.3792;-87.0629

Only one was shifting from side to side and up and down in motion frequently.  At times, the light would project on the tree line below and flash which seemed to trigger cows in the pasture on the opposite hillside. I without a doubt now am a believer.
