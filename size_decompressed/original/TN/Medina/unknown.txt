Unknown bright object disappears in a cloudless sky;2021-06-23 20:00:00;15 seconds;Unknown bright object disappears in a cloudless sky I was prepping my telescope to look at Venus and Mars.  As I was pulling the legs into place I looked up to make sure I was pointing in a good angle.  I glanced up higher because another bright object caught my eye.  It seemed to almost be hovering with no actual movement but I could be wrong on that, it could have been proceeding extremely slow toward the west.  It kinda had a glow to it like the sun was reflecting off of it.  I was waiting for the glare to stop so I could make out what it was, when it just disappeared, literally vanished. I hadn’t blinked and it was gone it was just there and then it wasn’t.  I have never seen anything like this in my life.  I was in our atmosphere for sure, I am no good with distances so I could not give you a distance worth noting.  After standing in disbelief and confusion I noted a plane crossing much higher up to the right of the  object but it was leaving a contrail it was a passenger plane for sure.  Whatever I saw left zero contrail.  This happened against a stunningly clear cloudless sky. Still daylight but a setting sun.
