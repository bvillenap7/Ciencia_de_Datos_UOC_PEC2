Sever minutes later, I observed three more in a triangle form like you would see if fighter planes were in a flanking position.  There was one bright light that remained stationary for about twenty minutes.  Then the bright white light started doing eliptical patterns.  Then as I look to observe the first object, it was doing eliptical patterns in the opposite directions as the bright light.  All that I saw was recorded by time in a notebook and I even mapped out the things I saw. The bright white light at two different times emmitted a white light and a red light that went away from it and went out of view.;35.2507;-88.9998
