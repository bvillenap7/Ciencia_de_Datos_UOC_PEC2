Orange “Fireball” Observed, Dickson County, Middle Tennessee;2012-10-19 20:30:00;~4-5 minutes;Orange “Fireball” Observed, Dickson County, Middle Tennessee   My husband, his parents and I were heading home after go out for dinner, it was about 8:30 pm CDT.  We were nearing the turn to our street travelling east when my husband, who was driving, alerted me to a round looking orange light to our right. My initial thought was that it was a light from the communication tower which was near our home, but upon studying it further, we could clearly see that it was nowhere close to the tower. We realized that it was moving, heading southeast, slowly and at about the altitude of a small plane or helicopter, but the light was burning steady, not blinking. By this point, all four of us in the car were watching it, and we had turned west onto the street to our home. We all agreed that it seemed to be “on fire”, or “burning”. My husband stopped the car and we opened windows to listen. None of us heard an engine or any sound from the object. It continued to travel in a southeast direction for another minute or so and then disappeared completely! .;36.0453;-87.3078
