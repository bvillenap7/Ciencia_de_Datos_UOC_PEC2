2 orange balls of light.;2013-11-03 07:45:00;10 minutes;2 orange balls of light My daughter took the dogs outside for a walk.  She came back in and said there is a bright light in the sky so I went out to check it out.  When I went out tosee it I didn't see anything.   I then went back into the house to get my jacket on and came back out to see an orange ball of light moving across the sky somewhere above a small plane and below a commercial jet altitude.  The first one I seen was going one direction and went behind some trees and then came out in a totally different direction that it was heading, and looked to stop and go a few times.   I went and got my wife who seen it and tried saying it was a plane, but I explained to her that there where no flashing red or green light on it.  And we watched it go over us and disappear in the distance.   The 2nd one came within a few minutes later and was heading in the same direction as the first started out.  It continued that direction until I couldn't see it again .;36.0453;-87.3078
