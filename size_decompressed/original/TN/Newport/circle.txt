The object I saw was like a round globe, dull white, in color. The strangest thing about this object was, it did not have a tail . That and the color. It was almost transparant. You could clearly see the shape. But the middle was a dull white. I have never seen a comet, meteor, or anything else, that did not have a tail behind it. I would be intrested to know if any one else reported this. The object was traveling West To East.;35.954;-83.2061
