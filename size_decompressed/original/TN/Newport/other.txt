Strange creature;2004-04-05 11:00:00;30 to 40 sec.;Strange creature It was shaped somewhat like an arrowhead flying backwards, with what looked to be a head or knob on the front. It didn't look mechanical, more like some kind of animal. It did not have extended wings like a bird of any kind, but seemed to have some sort of stubby wings which were part of the body, like a flying squirl or some type of bat. They protruded out near the head, & tapered back to a point at the rear. The creature appeared to be around 3 ft. from head to tail, & a little over 2 ft. wide at the shoulders. It was moving very fast in a straight line at an altitude of approx. 150 ft. I saw no method of propulsion such as wing movement. It just seemed to be gliding, but at a high rate of speed. It maintained level flight moving west where I eventually lost sight of it. Other details were a light brown color along the sides of the wings, like skin, with a dark body color, possibly dark brown or black.;35.954;-83.2061
