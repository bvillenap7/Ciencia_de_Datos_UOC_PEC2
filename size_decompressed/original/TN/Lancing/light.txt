Myself and two friends were in my back yard sitting around a small fire. I lived out in the country and the nearest neighbor or street light was at least 1/2 mile away. It was a very clear night with many, many stars visible. I was admiring the constellations when I noticed things were moving up there. Several white lights, (5-7) very, very high up, zipping back and forth across the sky, stop and go at impossible speeds. I attemped photographing them, but they were too far away to make out any details. Over the next few weeks, I saw similar objects, but not as many. I have no idea what they were, but this account is the honest truth.;36.1455;-84.7096
