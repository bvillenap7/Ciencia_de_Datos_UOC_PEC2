While driving home the diamond shaped object was hovering in the sky for 3 minutes. The object had lines that lit up the object around what seamed to be plates outlining the figure.  There was 2 extremely bright white lights at each end of the object. I stopped at a abandoned gas station and video taped on my iPhone 6S, the object which was still hovering at the moment for about 35 seconds then immediately starting moving in one direction. It appeared to have no acceleration. It just moved.  I am skeptical of UFO's what got me though was the movement of the craft and the fact that there was no sound. Even when it moved there was no sound. The object covered ground so fast when it became in motion that I don't understand how it did so with no acceleration.  That is what I saw and videotaped.  The object in the sky, was not like anything I have ever seen before. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.  PD));36.1455;-84.7096
