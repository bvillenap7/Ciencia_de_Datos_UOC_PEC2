Brilliant white light seen in the night sky over a rural area in Tennessee;2006-09-05 17:00:00;1-2 minutes;Brilliant white light seen in the night sky over a rural area in Tennessee I was outside of my house.  It had just gone dark.  I glanced up to the sky to the left and saw a bright, white light appear over the tree line.  I would say that it was very similar to the north star, except that the light moved.  It was moving to the right.  It appeared to be heading over my head.  I checked for flashing lights and/or a machine sound, the type that a plane or helicopter would make, and found neither.  It was at this point that I ran inside to get my witness, who is my mother.  When I got back out, the object had continued it's path, and appeared to be almost over my house.  Then the light made an abrupt change of direction, which took it on a path to the nearby town.    The turn may not have been a perfect right angle, but it was close enough.  It maintained a straight line for a few seconds after the change of direction, after which it began to make small jerky motions in more or less the same direction of the town.  It moved from the left to right fairly quickly, but it's pace away from my house didn't seem to pick up.  My mother suggested we go to the other end of the house where we have a deck, and get a better view since it was getting harder to see past the tree's in our front lawn.  We ran through the house, but by the time we arrived at the deck, the light had vanished.  As for our backgrounds.  I'm currently a student in college, and I would like to NOT mention my mother's background as she works for the state.  I have not consulted her about posting the report.;36.3888;-85.3194
