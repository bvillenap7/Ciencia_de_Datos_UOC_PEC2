Dancing red/orange object observed over Bethpage, TN;2004-03-02 21:00:00;Three to five minutes;Dancing red/orange object observed over Bethpage, TN I went outside to stargaze at about 9pm local.  As I left the house, I noticed that every dog in the area was barking and howling.  All the coyotes in the woods were also howling and barking.  Our house faces front/east back/west.  As I turned the corner on the northern part of the house to go from the back to the front, I noticed a red/orange light that appeared to be dancing in the sky.  It was positioned to the NNE of our house.  It is impossible for me to determine how far away it was.  It had the appearance of Alpha Orionis (sp?).  I stood and watched this object continue to dance in a pattern that was neither consistent nor predictable.  The air temperature at the time was @ 53 degrees.  It was partly cloudy, and the moon was at zenith and was 3/4 full.  At any rate, the object continued to dance just above the tree line until it simply disappeared.  When it disappeared, the canines that had been howling and barking stopped.;36.5217;-86.3171000000001
