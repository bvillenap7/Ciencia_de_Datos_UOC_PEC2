Same trajectory in a single file line.  No sound! After 30-45 seconds, they disappear.  At first thought, stealth choppers, or maybe floating lanterns, but these were too precise to be neither.  No flashing beacons. Just continuous glow of orange/red/yellow.  Can not believe what I just saw.;36.4566;-86.6638
