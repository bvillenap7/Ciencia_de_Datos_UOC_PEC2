Yellow and red oval orb flying horizontally over us in the city of White House, Tennessee.;2011-07-11 22:00:00;about 2 minutes;Yellow and red oval orb flying horizontally over us in the city of White House, Tennessee. The object was in an oval shape.  It was similar to fire but it didn’t look like flames.  It had a yellow ball toward the bottom, maybe towards the left side.  The sides and top were red.  It was moving at a casual pace from the right travelling left.  It eventually faded out. But it was moving horizontally.  Eight of us saw it long enough to observe without any trouble.  It was a decent size orb.  It was definitely not a plane or any other normal thing to be seen in the sky.  Reminded us of those flying lanterns but you could tell it wasn’t one.

5 bright red orbs traveling west then slowed stopped and turned to the south and faded out.;2016-08-27 23:15:00;5 minutes;5 bright red orbs traveling west then slowed stopped and turned to the south and faded out. My girlfriend and I were returning home from the store and as I was backing into my spot I could see two red orbs low on the horizon about a foot apart from my perspective through the rear glass.  We both got out and watched the two for about 1 min then the one to the left faded out then the next right after.  As the seconded one faded there came a third from the east and slowed stopped turned and continued south in the same manner as the first two. Then a fourth and finally the fifth all in the same flight path.  There may have been more before we seen the 5.  They made no sound at least none we could here. I thought at first Chinese lanterns but then the stopped and turned.  I did get video of the last three but it's really hard to see any detail. I also grabbed my binoculars, no detail, they just looked like bright red balls.  No flashing lights just solid bright then dimming. We watched for maybe 5 minutes.;36.4566;-86.6638
