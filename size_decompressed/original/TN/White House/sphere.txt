Four stationary red/orange spheres in the sky.  Three people including myself saw them while driving and they didn't move for at least a minute.  They were spaced at a fairly uniform distance almost directly above the road, but were too high and at the wrong angle to be on telephone wires.  In comparison to the moon they seemed to be about a quarter of the size of it.  We thought maybe they were helicopters but there was no sound accompanying them.;36.4566;-86.6638
