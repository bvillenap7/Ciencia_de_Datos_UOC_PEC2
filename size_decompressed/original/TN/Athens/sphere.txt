While focused on that planet, a movement in the sky caught my eye and it appeared as if one of the stars began to move slightly to the left of the presumed planet and then I realised there were no blinking lights or noises, and then I tried to film it with my cell phone, but it didn't appear on my sub par camera, so I watched it move further in the same direction then it appeared to zig zag slightly then just fade out as if it were never even there.  I wasn't at all freaked out as it seemed peaceful, almost like it was just enjoying a nice flight under the stars or amongst them.  I would like to point out that there were no visible clouds as I am posting this while still sitting in the same location.;35.4557;-84.6026
