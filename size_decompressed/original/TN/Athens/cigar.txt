I was on break at work with a friend, just sitting at the side porch at our company entrance.  As we were talking, I saw a glowing green substance or object coming horizontally in the air, just in my view over the main office building across the street. Upon seeing, I asked my friend to take notice.  We just set there and watched it go through the air until it disappeared.  After discussing what in the world it could have been.  The prospects for explaining it as a shooting star or falling space debree were impossible.  I promptly told my friend I was going inside and calling our local radio station to see if they were getting any calls about this sighting.....they were.(about 4-5 calls the DJ said)  The DJ is calling around different places trying to find an explanation, however he is not finding one.  I have looked through some reports of UFO sightings on reporting sights and found one explanation of a sighting that sounds like a possible match since we only had a side view.  It was a sighting on August 8, 2002, in North Royalton, Ohio.  Anyway, watch the skies. There are unexplained objects flying. Whatever they are God knows!;35.4557;-84.6026
