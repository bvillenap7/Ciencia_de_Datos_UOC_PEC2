Ok so what I see every night looks like a star to anyone who glances up but they move zig zagging back and forth and they have a red lazer beam light coming from them that is almost invisible to the naked eye but it moves around like its scanning the area and the beam moves all around it side to side around on the ground and it will shine it on other objects like itself beside it almost like they are communicating idk what they are but I could swear they react to my presence as I'm watching from the window they move more erratically and they come in closer to look at me and I can swear they react to things I say to and when they're beam looks at me my eyes go blurry for a second and their light doesn't blink but flickers and I have seen them link together with others like them and move around together in the same exact ! consistency and I say linked I mean there is actually a lazer light Between them that you almost can't see like the the light that scans things I've also been driving at night and had them follow me every where and I have a witness who was driving me when I saw it I pointed it to her and she started trying to ditch it making sudden u turns and taking back roads when we stopped at a gas station we parked at a pump under a canopy roof and I got out of the van and walked out from under the cover and it was there up in the sky hovering slightly above me and its light flickering I walked out to the edge of the parking lot and it moved with me I walked back toward the van and here it came and when we left it followed behind we took a back county road home and it tagged behind and I looked away for a min and my friend said omg look at this there's more of them and when I looked up I was blown away there were 4 to 5 of them now the first one was larger than the rest flying above th! e other smaller ones and they of course moved simultaneously i! n the sa me way all had flickering light on them following our every move I had seen anything like this and haven't since and it was about 8 months ago but when we got to her house they were gone they just vanished and also I've been seeing them in the form of lightning bug like things and they are in the yard flying around with the rest of the lightning bugs but they don't flash bright green they are bright led bluish light and they move around faster than a lightning bug can;35.4557;-84.6026
