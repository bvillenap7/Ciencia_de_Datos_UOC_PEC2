Heading down I-24 towards Murfreesboro from Manchester right before the Joe B. Jackson exit, I noticed a round silver object coming from the right.  Object was pretty far away and high in the sky and seemed to stop over the interstate in the center of my view.   After about a minute of hovering in place it just vanished.   The whole way home I tried to spot some aircraft in the area or any trails but the sky was clear.;35.8478043037976;-86.4398118987339

Traveling East. Out of a clear, cloudless sky, three or four objects appeared, coming down to about the one hundred feet level. My partner was asleep in the passenger seat. The objects traveled across the interstate, and disappeared into a nearby field. Or, went so far 'south' i.e., low, that they were unseen at that point. There was no sound. I was a TV cameraman for PBS for many years. I know my sights. I know my sounds. This was, how shall we say, Very Unusual. Thanks.;35.8478043037976;-86.4398118987339
