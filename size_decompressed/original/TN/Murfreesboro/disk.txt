We were driving south on a local Hwy. when I looked to my east and saw a Saucer shaped UFO flying alongside my car headed south.  It was in a green cloud and pulsated like a heart beat.  My passenger and I both saw it.  There were 3 portholes in the upper portion of the craft.  It traveled along the path of my car and at a point of about 4 miles down the road, it rotated to the left side, and within an instant was gone.  Only a small portion of the cloud was all that was left.  I called a friend of mine to tell him of the siting, and he said he knew what I had seen because he saw it as well.  He was traveling south on a Highway as much as 10 miles away heading south.  The wildest thing I have ever seen... ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Mysterious Disk seen lying on ditch of Tennessee Highway 840. Seen from an adjecent non-connected road. Then the Disk Vanished.;2001-04-16 07:00:00;3 to 5 minutes;Mysterious Disk seen lying on ditch of Tennessee Highway 840. Seen from an adjecent non-connected road. Then the Disk Vanished. While headed for the University, I was driving with my Grandmother when I noticed what appeared to be a car in the ditch of Highway 840. The color was a sort of brownish blue Maybe a teal purple or brown also, and I could see only what I thought was the roof of the car and I saw the sun shining off it. As we rounded the road that ran along side 840, I wanted to see if it was a state troopers car. As our car got closer to the object, I noticed that it was not a car. It was a perfect Disk. About 2-3 feet round. It was doing nothing at all. As I watched, I thought it began moving along the ground. But before I could get some sense of its direction. It vanished. There was no noise, no flash of light. It just vanished. I asked my Grandmother if she had seen the disk and she said no . I then thought maybe I did not see what I had seen, but then I remembered that I had thought at first it was a car in the ditch. There was moderate traffic on 840 highway. But at the angle the object was laying it would had been hard to see it from that road. Only from my road could you see it. Our car was the only one on the road we were on. After it Vanished I looked again to see if there was a car there and there was nothing there at all. I did not go over to the express way to see if it left anything behind. I am unnerved by this. I am having a hard time believing that I actually saw it. The only thing I know is at first I thought it was a car in the ditch. THE OBJECT: It was about 2-3 feet in diameter or long. It was about a foot high. and It was a perfect disk. There was no sign of life in the short 2-3 minutes the event took place in. The person who is reporting this (ME) Is very un-nerved. I truely want to believe it did not exist but I saw it. There was no time lost. and I arrived on time to the University.;35.8478043037976;-86.4398118987339

Later there were 3 lights, then 2, then l, but no other objects in the sky. There was a deep 'whooshing' sound as if you were blowing air over a cardboard tube or wind rushing.;35.8478043037976;-86.4398118987339
30 bright lights seen moving in formation in Murfreesboro, TN.;2011-10-09 19:30:00;4 minutes;30 bright lights seen moving in formation in Murfreesboro, TN. Last night at approximately 1930 I was driving home from work, going east, and noticed a formation of what I originally thought as stars in the sky to my right.  As I approached the formation, I realized each individual object was much too large to be a star. I then pulled my vehicle over to the shoulder of the highway where there were three other cars parked. The drivers of the cars and myself stood on the side of the road and looked into the sky.  One of the drivers counted 30 objects.  The formation was in the sky approximately at the height of what an airplane would fly and was moving very slowly as a unit from south to north.  There was no noise and the unit appeared to be “floating”.  Gradually, each bright light would fade out as it moved to a certain point.  Finally, the last bright light faded out but came back to partial light again, showing the formation of what appeared to be a disc with lights encompassing it.  Gradually, this object once again faded out, with the duration of visibility being approximately 5 seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and she sounded to us to be exceptionally sober-minded and objective, in her description of the sighting.  We suspect that she is a very good witness, particularly becaue of her technical training, and line of work.  PD));35.8478043037976;-86.4398118987339

An illuminated object, that at first appeared and behaved like a distant plane, suddenly dropped several miles with a long trail of fire, before stalling, glowing for a couple seconds and then disappearing.   During its descent, and its stillness, a cigar shaped object was seen in the fire.;35.8478043037976;-86.4398118987339

Hovered & changed directions quick;2020-02-03 18:45:00;75 minutes;We saw about 15-20 circular objects with bright lights. They formed triangle and pyramid formations.  Hovered & changed directions quick UFO report February 3, 2020  Two of my friends and I were watching the Super Bowl at a brewery outside of Murfreesboro on 93 acres in the middle of nowhere.  We were sitting outside so we could smoke cigarettes while watching the game and eating wings. We observed several bright lights above that seemed to be forming a circular formation across the horizon. At first we thought maybe the government was testing some drones.  But the longer we observed them the less we thought that.  They made no noise whatsoever.  Four of the bright lights closest to us began to shift around into a pyramid formation. They would hover at times, while moving around at stealth speed at other times. We could see other objects in the distance behind the bright lights closest to us. They moved quickly behind the lights...almost like shooting stars, but they were able to change directions at drastic speeds. They were circular in shape and appeared to be white or light gray in color. They also appeared to be three levels high, with each level represented by its own row of lights.   There was a white row with a red row in the middle and another white row on the bottom. They also had two very large lights in the center that almost looked like eyes in the sky. When they were hovering overhead, they remained lit the entire time. But when they started to get into the triangle and pyramid formations, the lights on the objects became much brighter. At one point, one of the objects was hovering less than 1000 feet above us. My friend got about four different videos. One of the videos shows the distance between one of the objects and the ground very well. The last video link I will list also shows a closeup of the objects extremely well. The videos were so large we put them on YouTube just so we could share the videos with each other more efficiently. I will list the four different links below: 1.     https://youtu.be/2RBEcFkja9w 2.      https://youtu.be/CJfgA2-MgDk 3.      https://youtu.be/5cCBfphOKUI 4.     https://youtu.be/W2wFG97qCDk;35.8478043037976;-86.4398118987339
