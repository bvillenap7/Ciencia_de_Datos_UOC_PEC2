strange flash of something shiny over Rutherford County, TN.;2001-06-03 15:47:00;less than a second;strange flash of something shiny over Rutherford County, TN. Ununsual flash of something shiny like metal in the sky far away to the north or possibly the northernmost-north-east(?). It was partly cloudy because it had rained earlier. A few dogs began to bark at about the same time, although I doubt that this had anything to do with whatever flashed because the object was apparently so far away. At that moment there were no airplanes in sight nor hearing. As for my, well, qualifications as an observer, I lived only hundreds of feet from Nashville International Airport for about eleven years, after which I have since lived near another airport.;35.8478043037976;-86.4398118987339
When I was on my way to church I suddenly saw a green flash.;2008-11-10 18:55:00;1-2 seconds;When I was on my way to church I suddenly saw a green flash. On Monday evening November 10th 2008 at about 6:55 pm (which is dark at this time of year) I was driving on my way to church down a narrow curvy road with a bunch of trees on both sides when I suddenly saw a bright green flash in the sky above and in front of me. The green flash had a small green object falling from the sky with green rings trailing behind it. The sighting lasted from 1 to 2 seconds and it quickly disappeared with tiny white sparks shooting out just as it vanished. All of this took place without me hearing a sound, probably mostly because I had music on in my car and I didn’t have enough time to even think of turning it down to listen, if I could hear anything. I got into a panic as I screamed “Oh my God!” and I started hyperventilating until I started to calm myself down. I’ve never seen or heard of anything like this before.  It wasn’t so much of an Unidentified Flying Object as it was an Unidentified Falling Object.  I was not able to determine the distance or speed because it appeared almost as fast as it disappeared.  I was driving down the road in a northward direction when the object fell almost straight down. I expected the object to hit me any second which was part of the reason why I panicked, the other reason was that it happened so unexpectedly that I was startled by it and quite a bit frightened. I was thankfully not hit by the object which makes me wonder if it just disintegrated or hit somewhere else. Unfortunately I did not have my camcorder with me when this happened, which makes me so mad because I’ve been trying to be prepared for anything like this to happen.  Even if I did have my camcorder with me I would not have the time to pull my car over and get my camcorder out and turn it on before it disappeared.  So I drew a picture of it on my computer as best I could to give a pretty good idea of what it looked like.;35.8478043037976;-86.4398118987339
