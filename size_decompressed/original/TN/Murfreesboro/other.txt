Three round ivory-colored single objects and two groups of 5 objects;2004-02-01 13:30:00;45 minutes;Three round ivory-colored single objects and two groups of 5 objects Between 1:30 and 2:15 p.m. on February 1, 2004, my wife and I were in a national park in the northern part of Murfreesboro, TN.  We were watching more than 25 jets that either flew northward toward Nashville or flew from west to east above Nashville or south of Nashville, above the town of Murfreesboro.  These jets were at a high altitude and left contrails that changed the sky from clear and bright blue to an almost uniform white haze.  During the 45 minutes that we watched the jets we saw (1) three different single objects and (2) two groups of 5 objects flying together but not in formation.  They remained in one place almost directly overhead, moved quickly from one part of the sky to another part of the sky, and disappeared and reappeared.  These objects were round and ivory-colored with a metallic appearance.  We did not see wings or evidence of propulsion, and we heard no sounds.  The objects were below the haze but seemed to be at a high altitude and small in size.  At any given time, the length of time that we could see the objects was about 1-3 minutes before they would disappear and then reappear in another part of the sky.  During this time we also saw a free-floating mylar balloon floating high in the sky with the wind, small aircraft, jets in the pattern to land at or take off from the Nashville airport, birds, and the above-mentioned high-flying jets.  The ivory-colored objects did not resemble these other things and flew in different directions (including against the wind).  None of the aircraft in the sky turned to approach or avoid the objects.  We doubt that these objects were very large white birds.  Our better guess is that they were some type of small remote-controlled flying objects.;35.8478043037976;-86.4398118987339
Bright Fiery unknown object;2007-09-01 23:32:00;6 minutes;Bright Fiery unknown object At first I seen a strange cloud, but looked as if something was on fire.  After watching the haze of smoke six of us seen a bright, bright light couldn't tell the shape, but was so bright and had a red glare to it as if it was on fire.  My husband thought it was a missile, I thought meteor, then after about a min in a half it was gone and so was the cloudiness. Strange event never seen anything like it at all.  Took lots of pictures not sure if they came out, but was scary when we were watching because we did not know what this fiery object was.  Had a chemical type trail to it.  Really crazy something we will talk about for a long while.;35.8478043037976;-86.4398118987339

I went into the backyard and saw what I first thought was a large airplane flying dangerously low, with a helicopter following very closely on its tail.  I at first assumed it was a plane having problems, and was trying to reach the MTSU airport.  Again, one hour later, same scenario headed in the opposite direction.  This time I got a closer look.  It was shaped much like an airplane, gray in color with absolutely no lights or windows that I could see.  The helicopter was again following very closely and did have its lights on.  I could clearly hear the helicopter, but the plane shaped object made no sound whatsoever.  It dawned on me then I had seen something extraordinary, that a plane could not fly that low or that slow without crashing.   I contacted Murfreesboro police who transferred my call to MTSU police to ask what was going on?  My call was returned after the person who took my call said she would try to find out what was going on.  She said she was unable to reach anyone at the MTSU airport.   One other person witnessed the object and helicopter flying over our residence both times.;35.8478043037976;-86.4398118987339
Unidentifiable hovering object seen by many and photographed.  ((anonymous report));2017-12-29 19:30:00;>5 minutes;Unidentifiable hovering object seen by many and photographed Traveling south on Fortress near the intersection of I-24 and Fortress at approximately 19:30 Central Time, noticed (along with others) a very strange set of lights in the eastern sky over Murfreesboro, which appeared stationary in the sky at an estimated 5000 Ft AGL, moving in no direction.  30+ others noticed and stopped to take pics and video. I took only one picture and after blowing it up and cleaning it up, I have never seen anything like it. Workers at a local Sonic Drive-In stopped to watch too.  At a distance, the object looked like two parallel V shaped lights vertical in the air. Upon closer inspection in a cleaned up picture, I can't really describe the shape of what appears to be a single connected object appearing as two objects from a distance.;35.8478043037976;-86.4398118987339
