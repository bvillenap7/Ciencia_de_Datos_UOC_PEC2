12 to 15 orange fiery object over Murfreesboro, TN;2011-04-23 21:00:00;30 minutes;12 to 15 orange fiery object over Murfreesboro, TN At 9:00pm on a clear starry night on 4/23/2011, my wife and I saw 12 to 15 orange fiery objects in the sky over town at a fast rate of speed.  They were not in any type of formation. My wife and I both decided to see what they were.   After 5 minutes or so we got to the point of where they were.  They had gone to the south east of town.   We both noticed one of the objects coming towards where we had parked.  It was very bright with no blinking lights.  As it went over head, all the lights were gone and we had a great look of the object.   The object was about 1000 ft in the air it made no sound at all. It was moving in a straight line going NW at about 55-60 mph.  The wind was out of the south at 6 mph.  The object looked as big as a 4 door sedan.  It was a grayish/white rectangle with rounded edges. It looked as if the object had a rippling effect after it past overhead.   After that object went out of sight, we saw another object headed our way with the same type of or! ange fiery light.  This object also had no sound to it.  As this second object went over head, it stayed glowing. There were no blinking lights on it.  All the other objects in the sky where these two came from were gone.;35.8478043037976;-86.4398118987339
