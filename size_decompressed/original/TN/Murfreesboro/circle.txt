Until I felt in side of my mind a strange feeling that I and all the people around me were being watch. I look up in the sky and it was there just watching all of us. I could tell from human awareness that there was life there. I watched and suddly the circle of light move like no way I have seen a plane or any aircraft move before. It was gone behind the clouds, whoever or what ever it was try to hide it self from the people on the ground. I know that there was life in that circle I could feel it.

Light Orange Sphere;2001-09-22 18:01:00;14 Minutes;Light Orange Sphere One light orange sphere was noticed at about 80 degrees from horizon facing North. A commercial passenger jet passed over my view of it, so its altitude was much higher than that of a commercial jet.  Its movement was very slow. It slowly moved South then stopped for a few minutes. It resumed changing its direction to the East then stopped again for a few minutes. Then it changed its direction to Southwest and moved slowly in that direction. Then it disappeared.  Seemed to stretch into a oval when initiating movement after being stationary then once moving it returns into a sphere.;35.8478043037976;-86.4398118987339
Extreamly bright, large, white light shot from one end of the sky to the other.;2013-08-31 12:45:00;2-3 Seconds;Extreamly bright, large, white light shot from one end of the sky to the other. I was alone driving down a county road just outside the city limits heading home from work at 12:45 am on August 31, 2013.  I saw an enormous white ball of light (slightly smaller than the moon) streak across the entire sky in 2-3 seconds.  It was traveling much too fast to be a fireball.  The object appeared in the western sky it moved over a field to the right of my car and then quickly moved out of my view into the eastern sky.  This object appeared to have a place to go;35.8478043037976;-86.4398118987339
Multiple UFO Sighting - Murfreesboro.;2016-05-21 20:50:00;1 hour;Multiple UFO Sighting - Murfreesboro. 	On 05-21-15 at 2050 hours, I observed multiple orange circular objects in the atmosphere traveling at high rate of speed, and what I judged to be 1000 feet or slightly more in elevation.  The objects grabbed my attention because they appeared to be on fire, until I observed several more, consistently coming from the Northeast part of the sky, and flying over to the Southeast part of the sky crossing the full moon before dimming out.   I observed these objects from a residential area on the West side of Murfreesboro, TN, with one other witness.  In addition, I could hear multiple other people in the area making noises every time the objects would fly over.  I could not see those individuals, and did not make contact with them.  The objects flew in a line formation, and then transitioned into a close triangle formation.  They gained altitude extremely fast, which I was unable to judge the speed, and they slowed down at times to a near stop in the middle of the air after traveling extremely fast.  Over a period of forty five minutes to an hour I observed twenty or more of these objects flying over the clear night sky.  There was no sound, no visible beacon light, no visible wings, and no observed aircraft spotlight.  The entire object was a bright orange, and no matter which direction it went it remained as such.  There were two aircraft seen in the same area during the event one flying at or around the same altitude, and was clearly heard and known to be a plane with definable wings I could see with the moonlight, and beacon lights.  The other was harder to hear and was flying what appeared to be higher than 30,000 feet, and I could see its beaconâ€™s flashing.  Neither of the two planes was flying in the manner in which the twenty or so objects were.   Originally, I suspected they were meteorites or asteroids because they appeared on fire.  However, they slowed down changed formation dimmed out and then got brighter.  They appeared to be in a controlled flight pattern.   I recorded video of this incident from the very first one I saw all the way until the last in two video segments.  The video shows everything I have described,  I zoomed in to 8.0 power for close ups of the objects, and I also caught the objects passing by the moon multiple times.   I contacted the Murfreesboro Police Department, and the dispatcher stated that there were no reports of any strange objects in the sky at the time I contacted them.;35.8478043037976;-86.4398118987339
