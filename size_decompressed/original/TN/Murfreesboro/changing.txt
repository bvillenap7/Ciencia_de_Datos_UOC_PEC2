3 extremely BRIGHT lights in a straight line.;2012-01-08 16:13:00;3-4 seconds;3 extremely BRIGHT lights in a straight line. While driving out of my subdivision, I saw 3 extremely BRIGHT lights in a straight line, above a tree line. Then they were gone. They were close together but far enough apart to see 3 separate  lights in a row. As soon as they disappeared a black object appeared and then descended backwards very fast. It was a cloudy day with low clouds.;35.8478043037976;-86.4398118987339
