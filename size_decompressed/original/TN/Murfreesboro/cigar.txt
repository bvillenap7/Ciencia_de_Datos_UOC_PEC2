Very,very long thin tubular object with no wingspan or lights moving slowly in straight line from Northeast to Southwest.;2020-01-07 05:45:00;2-3 minutes;Very,very long thin tubular object with no wingspan or lights moving slowly in straight line from Northeast to Southwest. This morning at about 5:45 AM CST I observed a very long and thin object with no apparent wingspan or lights. I am in the central Tennessee area. This object appeared to not be going very fast. It came from the Northeast heading Southwest. It was difficult to determine its altitude but seemed to be at the normal cruising height for commercial aircraft, but could have been higher. When I say that this thing was long, I mean extremely long. If a commercial jet would have been flying next to it, it would have taken 30-40 of them nose to tail to even come close to its length. I have seen no reports from others on this and was just wondering if anyone might have seen it or something like it at other times. I believe the only reason it was noticeable to me was because the sun had not come up yet but the object was capturing the sun because of its altitude and giving off a reflection to make it visible from the ground. It took about 2-3 minutes to cross from the Northernmost point of my visibility to the southeasternmost point of visibility. Never seen anything like it in my life. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.;35.8478043037976;-86.4398118987339
