Strange light/flame over Murfreesboro, TN;2009-07-03 22:20:00;30 seconds;Strange light/flame over Murfreesboro, TN I was sitting out on my patio tonight, in Murfreesboro, TN, and I was up looking at the stars and planes as they fly across the sky.  I looked up, and saw what I first thought was a low flying plane going through the clouds.  The reason for this is because there seemed to be a bright light with a ring around it, like a headlight looks going through the fog.  As it got closer, I realized it that the light looked more like a flame than a light.  It's hard to describe, but it was an orange light that seemed to change shapes as it went, and changed positions.  If you can imagine a small circle, it was almost like the light was going in a circular motion, but again, changing shapes like a flame.  The next thing I thought of was a hot air balloon, but again, it was going way too fast for a hot air balloon, but that is what it looked like.  Almost like a flame flying up inside a balloon.  This object was flying lower than the clouds that were out.  I literally watched it appear in the sky above the house next to me, and then walked to the side of my house to watch it continue as it disappeared behind the tree line, which is about a mile from my house.  I sit out on my patio many nights a week, and I have never seem anything like this before.  Like I said earlier, it almost appeared to be a hot air balloon from underneath, but again, traveling about the same speed I see planes flying after taking off my Nashville International Airport.  It also appeared to fly underneath another plane that was well up in the sky, I am guessing around 25,000 - 30,000 feet.  I'm not kidding, it literally flew directly underneath it.  If they were flying at the same altitude, they would have hit each other.  It appeared to fly at a level low enough, that if it were a regular single engine plane, I would have heard a noise, but I didn't hear a thing.  I was also listening to some music on my computer, turned down low so that it wouldn't have covered up any aircraft noise, and I never experienced any electrical probl! ems.  It flew on a straight path from east to west.  I didn't see anything coming out of it, or any light beams radiating from it at all.  I am guessing at the height it appeared to be at, which was around 5,000 feet, it traveled numerous miles in a matter of less than 30 seconds.  Not sure what else to say, other than I hope someone else saw the same thing.;35.8478043037976;-86.4398118987339
Bright object over MTSU campus in Murfreesboro on Oct. 15, 2012.;2012-10-15 16:40:00;45 minutes;Bright object over MTSU campus in Murfreesboro on Oct. 15, 2012. Viewing from downtown Murfreesboro, I and several others observed what appeared to be a bright object hovering several thousand feet above the Middle Tennessee State University Campus. The object appeared to be spinning while hovering in one spot.  It would get very bright and then dim. Toward the end of my viewing it, it moved off toward the Murfreesboro Municipal Airport, but never lost any altitude. When dim, it appeared to be a line, and when bright, it looked like an asterisk.  I have a photo of it. I had to go back inside my workplace and did not get to see where the object went after it moved toward the airport. There did appear to be a jet flying by it at one point, but I'm not a good judge of altitude. This is the first time I've ever saw something like this, and I am typically skeptical.  I cannot definitively say whether this was just a balloon or something more.;35.8478043037976;-86.4398118987339
Cigar or saucer shaped object above murfreesboro tennessee;2013-04-21 00:00:00;2-5 minutes;cigar or saucer shaped object above murfreesboro tennessee Three friends and myself decided to go for a drive one night because the weather was nice that night and there was nothing else to do that weekend.  We ended up on the outskirts of town where you could see the stars clearer when I noticed a flashing light like a radio tower.  We had pasted several radio towers with blinking lights on them, but I could tell it wasn't a tower or attached to the ground because when the car would turn, the object didn't move relatively away from whatever particular direction we were turning. It was hovering.  I didn't say anything to anyone else until I was completely clueless as to what and was and positive it wasn't attached to the ground.  Once I did say something, the other witnesses were just as baffled.  The lights on it were blinking. Along a slant as if it were cyclindrical or saucer like.  At one point it evenness seemed to go the same direction as the car at the same speed.  Almost as if it was watching us watch it.  Then, few! minutes after we had been watching it, we passed a wooded area that obscured our view of the object and once our vision had regain clarity, it was gone. Very odd indeed.;35.8478043037976;-86.4398118987339
After roll call a group of police officers were standing in the parking lot talking.

A very loud, low rumble, like a freight train is how we described it, passed overhead sort of slow.  We initially heard it when directly overhead and was so loud it drowned out our conversation.   We could hear it moving away from us for several seconds then it was gone. It was dark outside and couldn't see a shape or size.   Like nothing any of us have ever heard before.
