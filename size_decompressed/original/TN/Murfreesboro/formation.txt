weird falling flickering cloud;2011-10-28 13:00:00;10 seconds;weird falling flickering cloud was at the intersection on old fort parkway facing target...it looked like it was right across the interstate to the right about 500-1000 ft away...i noticed a fallin cloud of black specks...they would flicker from black to clear..like a cell under a microscope or something. it was fallin like a spider web in the wind. then split in 2...one part floated off to the left going up...the other kept falling slowly...i said what is that?. my friend then looked over and saw the one falling...then shortly after disappeared...it was like a cell...like clear cytoplasm with little black specks that flickered clear and black.

A formation of fiery orange balls moved low across the night sky;2013-07-21 22:30:00;5-10 minutes;A formation of fiery orange balls moved low across the night sky I was driving around 10:30pm in Murfreesboro,TN where I'm not very familiar with roads.  I happened to look alongside where I was driving, as a light had caught my eye.  I saw a formation of fiery orange balls, roughly in the shape of the Dipper in Ursa Major.  They were so low I thought they might be warning lights on power lines.  But they were over a field, where there were no power lines to be seen in the direction they were formed.  As I drove I noticed they were slowly moving.  There was no shoulder on the road I was on, and I raced to find the next pull-off.   Unfortunately it was in a well-lit shopping center.  I lept from my car, and pulled out my phone to try to capture images.  I was unable to see the original formation, as it had moved too far from view/disappeared.  But there were a couple of stragglers that were on the same trajectory that I did get on film (very poor quality).  They were travling from low to high, at a fairly consistent speed.  They were apparently traveling from Northwest to Southeast.  They appeared like they were on fire.  They didn't change direction, nor did the speed change.  Surely any kind of lantern or sterno prank (which had been suggested) wouldn't have been this bright. Also, there have been theories that it was a satellite breaking up, or refraction from a setting sun. But it was absolutely night.  However, they did go out of sight at approximately the same position.  And after the 2nd straggler was extinguished from view, there were no more.  I posted my video on facebook, and I did searches for similar phenomenon the next day, but I couldn't find anything in the area. I did, however, find a video from Oklahoma City in September that was strikingly like what I saw.  The formation they captured was larger, but very similar in span, formation, and intensity of light.;35.8478043037976;-86.4398118987339
Straight line formation of 30 objects.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-29 20:40:00;5 minutes;Straight line formation of 30 objects Straight line formation of approximately 30 objects across sky. There was equal distance between objects and seemed to go faster than a plane. They were traveling East to west.  Observers were looking at sky in anticipation of May 16th astrological event “Smiley face “. When we noticed the formation. Two observers are masters level educated women. One male bachelor level degree. We have no aeronautical experience but have never seen anything like what we observed.;35.8478043037976;-86.4398118987339
