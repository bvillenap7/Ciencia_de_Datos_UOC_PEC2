An optical illusion, not a UFO;2005-10-17 23:25:00;50 minutes;An optical illusion, not a UFO My wife and I looked at Mars saw small red and white lights flashing on and off quickly.  The lights were very close to Mars (within its halo) and below Mars, from the 4:00 position to the 7:00 position.   I called our son, who lives 6 miles away, and he saw Mars but did not see the lights. I suspect that the lights were some sort of an optical illusion.   The sky was clear, and the ground temperature was 54 degrees Farenheit.  There was a full moon to the upper right of Mars, and the night sky was very bright. ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witness was observing, but if they had been stars, the son also should have been able to see them from his vantage point.

2 ORANGE BALLS OF LIGHT APPEARED IN THE SKY 30 SECS AFTER ONE ANOTHER AND SHOT OFF AS A GREEN STREAK LIGHT;2007-01-14 17:00:00;5-10 Seconds;2 ORANGE BALLS OF LIGHT APPEARED IN THE SKY 30 SECS AFTER ONE ANOTHER AND SHOT OFF AS A GREEN STREAK LIGHT WHAT I WITNESSED:  I saw a yellowish-orange colored ball of light suddenly appear and accelerate so quickly it was far beyond the capabilities of all known aircraft.  When this ball of light shot of to the west, it appeared and I firmly believe it was traveling level to the ground as though it was completely parallel to the ground.  As it accelerated and shot out of sight, the object went from a solid yellowish-orange colored ball of light to a green streak of light that disappeared as quickly as it came. This entire event took no longer than 5-10 seconds.  -Less than 30 seconds later, I was still looking at the point in the sky where I had just witnessed something fantastic and rare when the event was repeated with all details the exact same as described above except this object was less than 100 yards to the north (the right) of the first object.  THE SPECIFICS: -I stepped outside and stood on my friend's porch to smoke and check out the current weather conditions as it had been snowing hard all day.  It was still snowing heavily and the clouds had to be at an altitude no higher than 2,000 AGL.  I was closely examining the cloud layer in an attempt to predict whether the snow would be letting soon or not.  I was of sober mind when I observed these 2 events witnessed this event and was looking west focusing on the fast-moving cloud layers coming out of the west and moving toward the east.  It is important to note that the weather conditions were such that the stars were not at all visible, flying conditions were IFR only, and there are neither airports nor victor nor jet airways in this area, neither are there any towers or buildings (only flat farmland) in this area.

A zig-zagging light in the sky last night made my sister cry.;2007-10-09 23:30:00;5 seconds;A zig-zagging light in the sky last night made my sister cry. My 20-year-old little sister called me last night, telling me that she had just seen a UFO. According to her, what she saw was a bizarre light that quickly traveled horizontally across the sky before zig-zagging up and down over and over again (-----/\/\/\/).  After this, it vanished. She is absolutely adamant that it had not been a shooting star. In fact, the experience was so fantastic to her that, she said, she began to cry a little.  For what it's worth, she neither drinks nor smokes, nor does she do any kind of drugs.;35.8478043037976;-86.4398118987339
Light, blinking, hovering,;2011-03-02 00:00:00;4 minutes;Light, blinking, hovering, I walked out of my apartment on campus to the balcony and was standing outside, a few minutes after midnight, and as always looked up in the sky, smoking a cigarette.  As I was looking up, I looked in the direction of the big dipper and just stared for maybe 5 seconds and a white light literally appeared out of nowhere and began to just hover and flash!!! I ran back inside and got my girlfriend and showed her, and she, in her half asleep state, said it was indeed flashing but she didn't know what it was (and didn't care.) I continued to look for a few more seconds, the light still in the sky, flicked my cigarette, finished at this point, looked once more and went inside.  Less than one hour later, I went back out for the same reason, and looked in the same spot as before.  Nothing was in the sky, stars barely visible from the constant lights on campus.  Then as before, the light appeared bright in the sky, and this time, i raced down to the sidewalk to get a bet! ter look.  Funny energies telling me this was getting worse as I got closer, I got to the sidewalk and the light was still there.  As I stared in disbelief at the fact that it was still actually there, it began to move closer!!! My heart began to race, my cigarette trembling in my hand, and no one else witnessing this but me, I watched, the light moving toward me but jerking rapidly as it moved, and as it got closer, ironically, 3 police cars drove by and I'm sure they wondered why I was wide eyed and mouth open looking in the sky.  As the thought to stop the last officer came to my head, the light that was moving toward me, just as it was blinking before, ceased instantly, less than a few hundred feet from my apartment building.  Chills and a worried mind were the last two things I took in as I went back inside, for the final time that night.;35.8478043037976;-86.4398118987339
3 bright objects in the sky and one of them darted quickly upward for 45 minutes as if it were climbing higher and higher in the sky;2011-04-18 00:15:00;45 minutes;3 bright objects in the sky and one of them darted quickly upward for 45 minutes as if it were climbing higher and higher in the sky Murfreesboro Tennessee, 12:15 AM  My sister and I have been watching a small cluster of light darting around the sky for abt 45 minutes. It started low in the sky and now is straight above our heads.  It will sit still for about 30 or 40 seconds and then dart around 4 or 5 times cmbing a little higher in the sky.;35.8478043037976;-86.4398118987339

Two lights circling and making random patterns in the sky at dusk and after dark.;2014-02-27 18:00:00;1.5 hours;Two lights circling and making random patterns in the sky at dusk and after dark Two lights were traveling in random patterns in the sky near our subdivision.  I was on my way home from work and noticed them about 2 miles from my home.   I continued to watch them even after I arrived home and had my son come out and watch them too.  There were no sounds coming from the objects.  It was as if two very high powered beams were traveling in circles and then would stop still and then make random patterns.   This went on for well over an hour and a half.   A jet plane flew through the area high above the lights but the lights continued the same behavior they had been doing all along.   We never saw an actual craft of any kind.;35.8478043037976;-86.4398118987339

Spring of 2016 I just happen to look up one night while my dogs are going outside and I noticed these white lights or round spheres.;2018-05-14 20:00:00;8 hours;In the Spring of 2016, I just happen to look up one night while my dogs are going outside and I noticed these white lights or round spherical shape white light that were just above the tree between mybackyard and my neighbor's backyard. I noticed every time I'd gone outside at night that these lights were there in the sky.  Sometimes they we're in different areas above that tree and I could see them move or spin etc. But most always where all between  the neighbors houses and mine in the backyards. with the naked eye you can see them moving and even changing shape if they were down low enough. well I didn't think much of them as time passes i just kept seeing them and the sky above the houses and trees then in August of 2017, I was out at 2:45 a.m. on my back patio and I did happen to look up and there were a few of these lights above the Treetops well I was yelling at my dogs to come in cuz I wanted to go back to bed and so I stepped back to the door and flickered my back porch light on and off quite quickly trying to get the dogs attention and it just so happened it was a red Christmas lights and I had never taken out at that time. After I flickered the light a few times I stepped back on my patio and I yelled at them again to come in and I looked up and one of these bright white lights Round probably the size of a very large oversized beach ball solid white orb type spherical light and as it got to the outer edges that was translucent but still white to some degree and in my mind I didn't want to think about what it was and so I just talk to it like it was a dr! one or something of that nature because if I had really stop to think I probably would have freaked out. So I started asking questions like what are you doing out this late what are you filming what are you doing why are you up there every single night and different locations of this neighborhood what are you trying to find out.  It made no noise it was silent my dogs didn't react to it they just sat there and so I just kind of said to it I think you better leave and I pointed up at the sky and it left. So every night since then except when it's raining these things are out there. There is any number of them from 1 to 7 I've counted in the sky. Now they are in different locations some brighter than others some dim. I live in what's called a circle rd. so you can step on my backyard and all you see are everybody's backyard and the road that's in front of my house goes around this circle of homes. These lights are usually between my house my neighbors, then across the street I've seen them. Down the block to the left of my home which is about five or six houses down and then the other way to the right they've been out down as far as three or four homes. They hang out as dusk comes in just before 8pm. They are at house top level or Treetop level or the telephone poles the wires or just above those and higher.  Then actually I can see them when they are moving up to where planes fly I've seen them actually go.  I've got many photos and videos over months. I've had probably 10 people come out nobody knows what these things are. Everybody's just amazed they change shape size the jump around almost like go dancing. They had different colors in them blues and greens and when they change shapes it almost reminds me of like when you see a dandelion and it's got those white cloud like things all around the seeds imagine that being sucked in and coming out being sucked in and coming out they do that like pulse. Another movement they do is where it's like a hamster wheel and then something spins with inside of itself and in photos you can see several orbs or light spot within the light source. These things are just amazing and just don't know what they are.  Earlier this year I contacted mufon and they came out and the time they did their investigation which was several months ago it was really odd because what I see around my home and just told you about is not what we experienced. When they were here we did capture some orb type things on video. These were not the white light up in the sky but were privacy fence level. We had our camera phones up on zoom to search the sky cuz that's were I see them but as we panned our camera phones down level we caught up to six white orbs type lights in my backyard. They were not presenting themselves as white spinning and moving like when they are in the sky.  What was in my backyard were change shape orbs from colors of orange and yellow but would begin as white. You could even see like rings of a tree or spine type things in the center of them and a few of the orbs we have on video like 19 minutes long. That's a very cool video to watch. In one way it was kind of disappointing because they weren't the lights in the sky that I see every night or it didn't present itself like when it came down to the sky and was in front of me. After that investigation I have not seen what we captured that one night. I've been seeing the white light orb type things in the sky around my home. I still have been sending mufon pictures and video of what I keep seeing every night but because she has no idea what they are disney know how or want to proceed. They at mufon haven't come back out to see these white light orbs in the sky. They dont know how to have me capture them where she can see them better or wants me to have them next to something so distance and size could be figured. Bit its dark at night so phone lines tree tops etc don't show up just the white light. I don't know it's just kind of frustrating. I can't find anyone that seems to know anything about what they could be. No one from any kind of Space or Universal profession like from local college won't retire my emails. I don't know who else to ask what these things could be and why there here around my house and our neighborhood.  They remind me sometimes of the Marfa lights only they're probably closer to me than those are from people who see them. Then also someone had mentioned to me about watching the video that NASA had put out about a tether that came loose in space and I guess either causing noise or bright light and all these white lights rushed to it and surrounded it and they didn't have an explanation for them and nobody else did either. Aanyway I don't know anyone else that knows what they are so I've now decided to report to other website like this one in hopes to find help in discovering what they are. Thank you!
