Unidentified craft seen after power interuption at home.;2002-08-07 23:05:00;Unknown;Unidentified craft seen after power interuption at home. Event began with several series of power outages. The lights at our house went on and off for about 3 minutes maybe 5. I then went outside to check the transformer box on the telephone pole. Noticed that most of the dogs in the area were barking and that our dogs were in a highly nervious state. The cats were also nervious and were trying to get in the house. Then I spotted an object that could had been a meteror. It was a bright light that traveled toward the south-southwest at rapid speed. I went back in the house for a moment to phone electric company. Found out from them that power outages were occuring in Cannon and Rutherford Counties. Went back outside to check up on dogs. When I got outside, I discovered all dogs in the area howeling and barking. I looked up and saw what appeared to be a craft flying at the lowest level that commercial aircraft fly. (I had seen aircraft fly at this height in the daytime and at night) Noticed that object had several lights. two underneight flashed. Object made no sound at all. It appeared to be moving slower than commercial aircraft but not that slow. Maybe 150 to 200 MPH. This object could had been a passanger jet but I heard no sound from it. All other aircraft that I had seen at that level have made the normal jet engine sounds. This one did not. It was like it was gliding. Then object slowly moved on toward Smyrna and Nashville. Dogs were going mad at this point in neighborhood. My two dogs were running about. Cats were also running about. Then spotted a white SUV traveling at high rate of speed down road. I now remembered seeing several white vans cars and SUV's traveling around area but not going slow(As if looking for something) or as fast as the one I saw tonight. Saw other cars that might be strange. White cars etc. Now, these vehicles may have nothing at all to do with event tonight, but thought I would mention the cars anyway. As I type this, event is still on-going. The main act of the event tonight was the unusual behavior of animals, mysterious cra! ft that might had been a passenger plane or an true unknown. The lights on Unknown seem to suggest a triangle shape. Object seemed huge. However it is night and that size could be deceptive. If it were day, I might had been able to see more detail and also determine if it were a passenger jet. Also, begining of event, power outages occured and according to message at electric company it covered two counties. All of this might just be normal, however, Object did not make sound and I had seen other jets at night that did. Object seemed to have too many lights. But this might not matter.

Delta Shaped Object seen flying toward Nashville TN from Murfreesboro TN.;2004-09-27 23:00:00;5 Minutes;Delta Shaped Object seen flying toward Nashville TN from Murfreesboro TN. Dogs started barking, Went outside to investigate. Saw two 2 lights(?) turning in formation. First thought these lights were landing lights, but one light made a slight motion separate of the second. Lights moved north west and appeared to merge. Then noted it was Delta shaped at that point, with about 6 Headlights on the underside of the Delta. Low roar or possiable sound heard. Object flew north west out of view.;35.8478043037976;-86.4398118987339
Triangles hovering close to ground over Mufreesboro, TN;2005-09-01 21:00:00;1 hour;Triangles hovering close to ground over Mufreesboro, TN Reading other Murfreesboro witnesses they are similar to experience I had.  Don't remember date but late evening on I-24 East coming over the hill you see Murfeesboro well.  There were several triangular bright shapes on either side of the interstate.  They did have a red light to some and somewhere I drew a picture.  I remember large round lights to the craft.  Most were up pretty high in the sky but what made me post this is a 1998 sighting and I saw the saw 3 triangles hovering very close to the ground directly over Mufreesboro in a triangular formation.  They were still.  People were pulling off the interstate and slowing down so I know I wasn't the only one seeing it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Triangular shape white light with red and green lights on tips having a haze on the sides. lasted over 2 hours;2012-09-09 04:43:00;2 hours;Triangular shape white light with red and green lights on tips having a haze on the sides. lasted over 2 hours I was sitting out on my deck at 02:30. I was looking at what I thought was Mars. It was twinkling with a red and green color. I took out my scope to get a better look and saw that it was not Mars. So I took a look at what I thought was the planet Venus. When I was looking at it through the scope it suddenly got smaller and disappeared from view. A few seconds later it came back. This happened about 3 times.  I took my camera from my smart phone and found the object through the scope and took multiple pictures.  The best picture I got I zoomed in on it and it shows a triangular light with a red tip and a green tip with a gas like emission radiating from the sides.  It also looks like I can see a round image on the top of the image.;35.8478043037976;-86.4398118987339

This is not the first one i have seen but it is the first one like this.;35.8478043037976;-86.4398118987339
Saw six varying color UFOs take off at different times.  Was weird.;2017-12-13 21:15:00;~1 hour;Saw six varying color UFOs take off at different times.  Was weird. Dogs were barking... stepdad called me outside to check with him.  He is an army vet of many years and knows the difference between stars, airplane lights and helicopter lights--etc.  These were not any of the things listed.  We counted six crafts at first (either red-white or green-white but NEVER red-green) shaking/hovering erratically...  After abut ten or so minutes one moved to the left of the crafts and seemed to get closer but also fly away... it got clearer but it was flying off.  It looked like airplane lights blinking on the video I took, but as I said, it clearly was not.  There was a distinct triangle-shaped look of the object flying off in real life. This happened again about ten minutes after the first craft flying off.  Then two other crafts, ten minutes apart, flew off in the other direction. THE WAY THEY WERE HOVERING WAS NOT POSSIBLE BY AN AIRCRAFT WE KNOW OF.  It was shaky but stable.  Moving back and forth but then being totally stationary.  Totally unwavering.  Literally not a SINGLE MOTION. Two crafts remained.  We busted out the binoculars to look at them.  They both had an odd 3D look to them--if that makes sense, but I will also add it might've been light refraction because they also appeared a white-ish color from a distance. This was also the night of a meteor shower.  I know this. However these were not meteor-like in nature at all. It was very cold out and we were losing interest.  We went inside.  This is the second time my family has seen this (albeit the first was my dad in the 70s).  Once a generation, I guess.;35.8478043037976;-86.4398118987339

It was a little larger than 2 18wheelers with lights on each side and one larger light toward the center back of the craft.;35.8478043037976;-86.4398118987339

We weren't sure what it was so we slowed down and watched it from our moving vehicle and then went passed some trees to turn around and it was completely gone.  It was a completely clear night and there was no trace of it at all.  Nothing was on the ground or flying away.;35.8478043037976;-86.4398118987339
