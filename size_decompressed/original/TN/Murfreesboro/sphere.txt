The;1998-04-15 15:00:00;5min;while traveling south on I 24 @ 10 miles north of murfreesboro I saw three round silvery bright objects in an equilateral triangle. They did not move but remained motionless. Very bright but looked like large polished silver balls. The most forward of the balls suddenly inflated in size and then they all vanished. I could not tell the size of the object. They seemed to be within a mile or so. To me they looked @ 3 inches big from the distance I viewed them. I would guess they were ten feet in diameter or larger. The day was partly cloudy. The interstate runs downhill at the point where I noticed them. They remained for @ 5 minutes before the sphere closest to me became larger and then they all disappeared. I was wondering if any one else had seen it out of the many people on the interstate going home. The objects were a good 50-70 ft off the ground. I could not tell if they were lighted or if the sun was reflecting. That is really the only thing from the list below that I saw.;35.8478043037976;-86.4398118987339
Large spherical object seen in Murfreesboro TN.;1999-11-15 17:00:00;six seconds;Large spherical object seen in Murfreesboro TN. I saw a spherical shaped craft that was silver like mercury or a christmas tree ball ornament.  I was looking skywards to observe a flock of geese flying overhead.  Just above the geese was a sphere that appeared to be about the size of a two story house.  If it were not for the geese I would not have seen the object because it was very stealthy.  It was afternoon near sunset and I could see the golden glow of the sun and the horizon reflected on the side of the sphere.  I must say it was beautiful and it seemed to be a very sophisticated object.  I was never quite sure of the existance of ufos or alien technology, but having actually seen one so clearly, I am now somewhat disappointed in the government's lack of informing its citizens of the reality of such craft.  It flew quickly, left no contrail and was silent.  I will never forget it as long as I live.;35.8478043037976;-86.4398118987339
Bright orb of fiery red light seen beneath cloudy overcast in southern sky.;2004-12-23 16:30:00;Several seconds;Bright orb of fiery red light seen beneath cloudy overcast in southern sky. My mother and I were driving south-west on Old Fort Pkwy/Memorial Blvd. Weather was extremely cloudy with no blue sky in sight. It had been snowing a little earlier and probably will again tonight from the looks of it, although it was not snowing during the sighting. My mother was driving and I was in the passenger seat. We were near Wendy's restaraunt when I saw what seemed to be a large, orangish-red orb of light just below the clouds in the southern sky perhaps a few miles away. It was really bright and I immediately pointed it out to my mother. She wondered at it, too. However, within maybe 5 seconds it vanished, perhaps overtaken by the thick clouds. I searched the sky for several seconds, hoping it would reappear, but it didn't.;35.8478043037976;-86.4398118987339
6 red sphere shaped UFOs formed a pair of triangles in the sky and vanished.;2012-09-09 20:00:00;3 minutes;6 red sphere shaped UFOs formed a pair of triangles in the sky and vanished. We saw three fire-red sphere shaped UFOs ascend into the sky and form the shape of an inverse triangle. They then began to spin around and around.  Then three more of the same UFOs ascended and did the same exact thing.  Then all 6 of them began to slowly rise farther and farther into the atmosphere before one by one they started to vanish into thin air.  This all lasted about 2-3 minutes.;35.8478043037976;-86.4398118987339
large gray colored sphere with 2 red blinking lights.  Flying slowly.;2014-09-16 20:00:00;2 minutes;Large gray colored sphere with 2 red blinking lights.  Flying slowly. Light gray colored sphere with 2 red lights in the sky.  Was flying rather low in the sky.  Making a faint sound like a vacuum cleaner.   Did not move fast, but moved across the sky and behind the tree line in my back yard.  The red lights were blinking fast.   Tried to get video, but it was too dark to see much.   This thing scared my dog who was trying to get inside the house as fast as she could.;35.8478043037976;-86.4398118987339
Dark Red Orb Slowly Moving Across Skyline.;2016-08-10 20:25:00;20 seconds;Dark Red Orb Slowly Moving Across Skyline. 8/10/16 – Murfreesboro, TN, approximately 8:25 p.m.. I was pulling at of my driveway to go to the gas station and looked up and saw a small red orb–-which I at first thought was a star or Mars, but then realized it was moving slowly and was a dark red.  It was not blinking, but was solid red in color. I put my vehicle in reverse to not lose visual of the orb in the tree line and watched it get bigger.  Clouds were I would think between 6k to 8k ceiling.  When it entered the clouds it looked more like a large fire ball--only there was no trail and it made no noise.   When I lost it in the tree line I drove in the direction it was going (within seconds) yet it was gone.  Drove around for about 10 minutes looking for signs of it…..but didn’t see it again.;35.8478043037976;-86.4398118987339
