Two cylindrical shaped objects,whitish or silvery gray colored, moving next to each other on or around August 5th,2004 around 5:30 PM.;2004-08-05 17:45:00;3-2 Minutes;Two cylindrical shaped objects,whitish or silvery gray colored, moving next to each other on or around August 5th,2004 around 5:30 PM. We were outside in front of my house about  5:30 - 6:00 PM,on oraround August 5th,2004 talking while I was trimming bushes,and one of my friends told us to look - there were two wierd things moving in the sky. We turned to look where he pointed,and we all saw the two objects,we confirmed with each other that yes,we saw these things.  They looked like two cylinder shaped objects,that were either white or silver gray color,and were moving nearly alongside each other at what appeared to be a normal speed. Whatever they were,they were moving almost next to each other at a pace where it was not hard to see them. After a minute or so,one looked like it was slowly gaining altitude and also started moving Southeast,while the other one kept going straight South. We could see no windows,etc. on the sides of it,as if it were an airplane,and no wings,just two cylindrical shaped objects next to each other moving at a normal pace through the sky.We have never seen any flying object that looked like this before,and we joked that U.F.O's are watching people and giving tours to see what humans do in their free time.  My friend told me the next day that he tried calling the local college and the local airport to find out if there were any weather balloons,etc in the sky the night before,and he was told no,also he said he had called local Police or Sheriff's and tried his best to explain what we all had seen,but they kind of chuckled at what he was trying to describe to them. (I don't know exactly what he told them,but it must have seemed funny to them.)  I cannot remember exactly what day this was that we saw these objects, but I remember it was in early August of this year.  Now just within this past week or so, on or around October 3rd or 4th,2004 my friend and I saw what appeared to be the same type of object in the sky. This was just about a week ago. We were coming out of a local store and putting our items in the car trunk when he said to me Look! There's that funny looking thing again! He pointed towards the East in the sky,and it did look like the same type of object we had seen in August. This time we only saw one,and it was traveling across the sky at a normal pace where it could easily be seen by anyone who was looking in that direction. It went from East to Southeast until it faded from view into the distance. We kind of joked about it and went on about our business.;35.8478043037976;-86.4398118987339
Cylinder shaped object hovers near freeway;2006-07-19 01:30:00;15 sec;Cylinder shaped object hovers near freeway While driving east on interstate 24 going into murfreesboro, at a break in the tree line that runs parallel to the freeway, I noticed a cylinder shaped object suspended at a level even with the trees.I first noticed this out of the corner of my right eye.Which would be the passenger part of the front windsheild of the truck I was driving.     It's hard to guess how large the object was.It was in a veritcal position with a curved dome top,and it had some smaller boxey parts attached to the side I observed,also at the bottom of the craft there was something hanging out of it toward the ground.The grass was tall so I could not see if this line or whatever you want to call it was actually touching the ground.There were no lights visible,but it was clear that night and of the many cars that were on the freeway that night anyone could have seen this if at that tree break they would've looked to the right.;35.8478043037976;-86.4398118987339
