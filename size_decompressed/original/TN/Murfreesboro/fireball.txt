Two objects seen possiably leaving moon's surface or flying around Moon....;1999-09-01 23:58:00;5-10 minutes;Two objects seen possiably leaving moon's surface or flying around Moon.... Was out seeing off a friend when I looked up at the moon and noticed a flash and saw two objects streak over Lunar surface. One object seemed to crash/land/enter the moon, the other 1. moved left to right and then moved southward (down) the moon and either went off into space or went on back behind the moon... It's path was curved. They seemed very bright but were spheres of light. There was just one observer. Me. color was from white to orange. Observer is a College Student;35.8478043037976;-86.4398118987339
Remarkably large, green fireball heading N;2008-11-10 22:52:00;2 seconds;Remarkably large, green fireball heading N I was driving NW at about 25 mph. along Meadowwood Dr. when I saw a bright flash in the sky to the N, heading N.  It seemed in every characteristic to be a typical falling star, except that it was remarkably larger and brighter than a falling star, and green.  It streaked across the sky toward the N in a falling manner, and disappeared. The weather at the location at the time of the phenomenon was a pleasant 42 degrees, with visibility at 9 miles, humidity at 72 percent, and partly cloudy skies.;35.8478043037976;-86.4398118987339
Light in sky moving vertically fast and changed into disc shape.;2013-06-29 23:00:00;2 minutes;light in sky moving vertically fast and changed into disc shape I saw a golden glow floating vertically at a high speed.  I dismissed it as a firework or plane until I noticed it was staying constant and accelerating in an unusual way.   After one minute it changed direction and moved horizontally over my home, at that time appearing as a gray disc which blended into the clouds.
