Bluish green fireball.;2015-08-03 22:25:00;2 seconds;Walking inside and noticed what I initially thought to be a jet, but with no sound.  As I was watching, I observed a bluish green fireball, traveling faster than any plane, and even if it was a plane, as low as it appeared to be you should be able hear it.  As soon as it appeared it just mysteriously vanished and was no where in sight. As soon as I seen it I yelled for my GF to look...  After it disappeared, she walked back to me and said, I just seen an UFO.  She described exactly the same thing I seen.   We have no explanation.;36.5949;-85.6741
