It seemed to flicker, not blink (as some aircraft do), almost like the flame from a candle. There was no sound and my first thought was that it was perhaps some kind of magnesium flare or something similar, although it seemed to hover in the sky, instead of down in an arc like one might expect. It was visible to us for a minute, maybe two, then moved up and away, out of view, to the northeast. The shape was difficult to discern, due to the distance, but it looked almost like an egg or teardrop.;35.1263388946818;-89.9382290928053
