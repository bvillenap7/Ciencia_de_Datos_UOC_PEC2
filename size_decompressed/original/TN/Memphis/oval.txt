Day and Night - Saw object twice c.2009.  3-witnesses.  Very similar to that object in the Tulsa OK sighting c.1965.;2009-10-01 18:00:00;Twice - 1-5 minute sighti;Day and Night - Saw object twice c.2009.  3-witnesses.  Very similar to that object in the Tulsa OK sighting c.1965. 1 Day, early evening hour, I was outside smoking on my carport.  As I was looking across the road over the tree line, a metal object traveled up and over the tops of trees.  It was silver with a copper strap that ran down the middle of it.  It was not floating, it traveled with purpose.  It stopped and start on its way.  I hollered to my husband who was inside the house, to look out the window, by the time I went to knock on the window to get his attention it moved off towards the North East, until it disappeared behind tree line. Day 2 - Was a night time sighting.  First seen by my husband, then me, and then my daughter driving up the road from her work. We are in the country, no streetlights, so we saw it very clearly. It was the same object I had seen a month or so ago, (Day 1) but it was illuminated from within. No lights flickering, no blinking parts, no noise or sound.  It traveled slowly up and over the same tree line, then moved paralell to the tree line, and the illumination went off. We could not see or track it from then as it faded into the dark sky. Haven't seen it since. The object was the size and shape of the pilot cockpit of a hellicopter. Silver with copper strap down the middle of it.  It traveled with purpose and silent.  Was not a balloon or blimp. NAS Millington could not confirm nor deny seeing it on radar.  And basically made my husband feel like an idiot for calling with the information and sighting. I have a photo of what I saw.... I was watching a UFO special on TV one day and saw the exact same object on the TV!!!  I rewound it and took a photo off my TV screen. The object I saw is very similar to the photo of the sighting of Tulsa, OK c.1965. Thank you. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.
