Rectangular white object observed for a minute or less over Memphis about fifteen minutes before sunset.;2010-09-11 18:55:00;one minute;Rectangular white object observed for a minute or less over Memphis about fifteen minutes before sunset. I saw a single rectangular white object which appeared flat and featureless, almost straight overhead, moving from the southwest to the east-northeast, at about 6:55 pm Central Daylight Time (about fifteen minutes before sunset).   I watched it until my view was blocked by some trees, at which time it was about halfway down to the horizon.  It maintained the same perfectly rectangular shape, and maintained an extremely steady speed in a perfectly straight line, the entire time.  I did not hear any sound from it.  I did not see any sunlight reflections on it.   Planes from our main airport fly over this area very often, and it was at about the same height and moving at about the same speed as those planes often are.  However, it was definitely a perfect rectangle and not a plane (although it was about the same size as the jets I often see, or maybe a little larger than that), and it didnâ€™t move irregularly at any time as I have seen wind-borne debris do (and th! ere was not even a breeze at ground level at that time).  I was only able to see it for a minute or less before my view was blocked by the trees.  I was formerly a litigation paralegal for over twenty years, have a Bachelors degree, own my home (where I observed this object), and was not ill or under any influence from alcohol, medication, or any form of drugs at the time I observed the object.;35.1263388946818;-89.9382290928053
Standing at my window around 0:00 brilliantly lit objects the size of aircraft carriers, passed by, one by one.;2014-05-08 00:00:00;15 minutes;in Memphis Tennessee standing at my window around 100 brilliantly lit objects the size of aircraft carriers, passed by, one by one. Standing at my half opened window at 6 minutes to midnight on May 7, 2014, lasting until ten minutes after midnight, May 8th, I saw objects that were the size of an aircraft carrier with such brilliant lights, especially those in front and behind that I could not actually see the object.   They moved very fast, one after the other, with several seconds in between, heading in the direction of the airport,  There were many many of them, maybe 100.   They made almost no sound at all, to be distinguished from jet planes which go by all the time and are noisy.
