2 huge triangle shaped objects, low to the ground moving very slow. we follow them for several miles before they vanish.;1978-07-01 01:00:00;45 mins;2 huge triangle shaped objects, low to the ground moving very slow. we follow them for several miles before they vanish. During the summer of 77 or 78 in the early morning hours 1:00am to 2:00 am, We observed 2 triangle shaped objects, low to the ground about as high as 2 tva towers off the stacked on top of each other, so we could see them very clearly. they were huge in size, about the length of a football field if I had to guess. they were dark in color, but at the same time they had a glow about them. As them moved along very slowly from the bottom of the craft underneath several thin, but bright pink or red tentacles would roll down about 25 feet, stay there for several minutes and then go back up inside the object. This was repeat over and over again ever so much of a distance. We follow for several miles(5to7), never losing visual contact until they just vanish right before our eyes. also in the local newspaper the police had reported seeing these objects,several days in a roll.These are not the only ufo's I have seen in this same area. some I have seen on the ground at only 50 yards away (3cigar shaped), a T-shaped object close up just hanging in the air for about and hour and big as a city block. there are others, but I won't go into that now. thank you for your time, I hopr this is helpful in some way.;35.1263388946818;-89.9382290928053
ufo sighting over my car  Memphis;1978-09-01 19:00:00;6:00;ufo sighting over my car  Memphis check files concerning ufo sightings on the month and year previously filed.  I saw this thing over my car accelerate from zero to several thousand miles an hour.  So did half the law enforcement in Shelby as well as Desoto county, Ms.  It was on the front page of the paper the next day.  Unexplainible is was.  Pushed under the carpet I guess. 77, or 78, the fall or late summer.  It seemed as though we lost some time while underneath whatever it was.  None of us felt the same as we had before.  It hovered over my car for about 30-45 seconds and then sped off at an aeronautically unimaginable speed.  I have always been fascinated by aircraft ever since childhood have spent almost my entire life learning everthing i could about their characteristics, however, never have i seen nor do i want again to see anything like that again.

Three lights in a triangular formation.;1986-06-01 23:00:00;1-2 minutea;Three lights in a triangular formation. I am a 38 year old female.  When I was 16-17 years old I saw something unlike anything I have ever seen. It was very late at night and my parents where sleeping. I was in the living room watching television.  I decided to look out the window at the stars. The view from our window was unblocked and the sky was full of stars that night. I had only been looking for a few seconds when I suddenly saw what I believe was a UFO.  Three lights in a triangular pattern appeared in the sky. At the top of the triangle shape was a red light. At the bottom in each corner was a white/yellowish color light. The two lights in the bottom corner left there position at a rapid rate of speed. The light in the left corner moved to the left and the right light moved to the right in the same formation at the same time. Both lights went out away from the red light. The two lights suddenly returned to their exact positions as before and the whole thing disappeared as if someone just turned it off.  All I saw was lights in the form of a triangle. If it was a ship of some kind it had no other lights on it except the three that I described. I have never seen anything like this before or after that night. Considering my age reporting what I saw at the time was of no importance to me. Now that I am older I feel it is important that someone knows of what I saw. If it was a UFO or not maybe the information I have to offer could be of some kind of help or assistance to our world or country.  I reported my sighting as one or possibly  three sightings because the two lights separated from there position as if they where separate from it but had a connection to the red light at the top somehow. From what I saw I believe it to be one main ship with others that detach . Thank you for time reading this and I hope I wrote it where you can understand what I saw. Iâ€™m more then glad to offer more detail if needed. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));35.1263388946818;-89.9382290928053
Black triangle near I-55 south of Memphis, observed for 10 minutes by two people.;1998-02-05 00:45:00;00:10;Black triangle near I-55 south of Memphis, observed for 10 minutes by two people. Approx 30-40 miles south of Memphis, Tennessee along Interstate 55. Observed lights crossing a few miles ahead moving from west to east. Assumed that it was a commercial aircraft making approach to Memphis airport. After traveling about 3 to 5 miles, the shoulder of the highway widened, allowing a better view of the eastern sky. Observed a black triangle with white lights near each tip and a red light in the center. Object was estimated to be 300 yards from the highway at an altitude of 4 to 5 hundred feet. It was moving Northeast at a speed slower than traffic on I-55. Two witnesses observed object for approx 10 minutes until it slowly passed out of sight behind the treeline. NO sound was noticed, however the vehicle was never stopped to listen for noise. Sighting was not very exciting to view. Observers were amazed at how much like the computer generated models from televisions program recreations of past sightings. Witnesses were a police officer and an accounting clerk(! Husband and Wife) Husband had 20/20 vision and is former military, familiar with aircraft types. Wife was driving as husband rode in front passenger seat. Husband assumed that it was a commercial aircraft and the appearance was a trick of light and shadow created by the landing lights. Made comment to wife to the effect, That's what these people have been seeing. Wife commented, How fast do commercial aircraft fly, because we are going 70 mph and we are passing it.

Second sighting from the same general ground location, though not in the same location in the sky.;2001-11-14 05:35:00;2 minutes;Second sighting from the same general ground location, though not in the same location in the sky. I had previously reported spotting a black object flying very low and very fast over Winchester Road after dawn on 11/02/01. I had absolutely no expectation of seeing another unusual object in the sky, and yet that is precisely what occurred this morning. My account has two parts, so please bear with me. Part I: Leaving for work at 5:28 a.m., I stepped into my garage and hit the button to lift the door. (I looked at the digital clock just before I stepped out.) Moving alongside my car after the door was up, I saw the newspaper in our driveway and decided to pick it up before I left. Before I made it to the driveway, however, a very definite and very well-defined and lengthy shadow flitted across the driveway and our front lawn. There was absolutely no sound associated with the passing of this shadow. I'm not the nervous type, but the shadow startled me so that I jumped into my car instead of going out to pick up the paper. I'd never seen anything like this before. It was still quite dark, but a street light illuminates our entire yard to a certain extent. My first impression was that something huge had flown beneath the street light and cast the shadow. This explanation was quickly discarded due to the physical impossibility of such an event, but I was puzzled by what I saw. It appeared that our cat had been startled as well by the passing shadow because she ducked for cover under a hedge. Part II: Seven minutes later. It is now 5:35 a.m., an hour before sunrise, and I am traveling east on Winchester Road. There is almost no traffic. The sky is mostly clear. It's 48 degrees, and the winds are calm. A few stars are visible, even though there are city lights nearby. I am going to work early to complete a project. I've put all thoughts of the shadow behind me as I mentally prepare for the day ahead. The usual Fed Ex jets are flying past on their west-to-east flight paths, leaving Memphis International Airport, and I pay them little attention. However, as I passed the Nike plant on my left, I noticed a plane that seemed much lower in the sky than normal for this part of the landing and take-off pattern. It definitely caught my attention. It appeared to be hovering in place at a spot just east of the Nike plant on the north side of Winchester Road. This area is about five miles away from my home. I slowed down and came almost to a stop to get a better look at the plane. It was my perception that it was not moving at all. As I studied it, I realized that there was no strobe light on it. It also did not cast its lights ahead of it, as you would normally expect to see the lights of a jet beamed straight ahead. Instead there were three white lights aimed downward. It was then that I perceived that I was looking at a triangular-shaped craft with three bright white lights, one at each corner, and a single red light in the middle of the underside of the craft. The craft was approximately the size of a fifty-cent piece held at arm's length. If I had to guess, I would estimate that it was about a quarter to a half-mile away from me, hovering in place. It exhibited no motion whatsoever, and from my perspective, seemed to be hovering over an empty field. I got quite a good look at it for a period of time I would estimate as long as two minutes.(I regret not having the presence of mind to roll down my window and listen for any sounds. I was too surprised by what I was seeing.) I continued heading slowly eastward until I lost sight of the object as I passed some trees. It was then that I resolved to make a quick U-turn and go back and get another look. I found a place about two blocks farther on to turn around, and I raced back to look at the object again. There was no trace of it whatsoever! I searched the sky for several minutes in vain. The object had quite simply vanished. What I saw was very definitly NOT a star. It was not Venus or Jupiter. I know what the planets look like when they rise in the east. This object was in the northern sky as I faced east. The object was NOT a light on top of a cell phone tower or a utility tower. (I checked on the way home, and there are no towers of any kind in the vicinity of my sighting.) It was also very definitely NOT one of the Fed Ex jets. I had an opportunity to compare the object to the jets flying past in the background, and they were very different. This craft was lower than the jets, and the lights appeared to be of a different intensity. I have no explanation for what I saw, but I decided to give as detailed an account as possible so that others in the Memphis area can keep an eye out for such an object in the sky. It might possibly be one of our own aircraft, keeping watch over the skys in this area during this troubled time. If so, it seems to be a remarkable craft indeed. Of course, I have no way of knowing if the shadow flitting across my lawn was related in any way to the object I spotted a few minutes later in the sky. When I got home this evening, I saw that a bright light traveling behind one of the tall trees near our driveway could have produced such a moving shadow. The light would have had to have had much greater candle power than the street light, however. I've lived in this home for over a decade and have never witnessed such a phenomenon before.;35.1263388946818;-89.9382290928053
My exited triangular craft sighting;2004-11-12 21:00:00;30 seconds;My exited triangular craft sighting I was outside at night on 11/12/04. And i had a camera taking pictures of my sister just for fun when. It was really cloudy outside and i saw something go right over our carport. At first i suggested an airplane, then i saw three sides and claimed it as a triangle. It was a ufo and i have seen 2 ufo's before this sighting date. But this i actually got a picture of it! My luck i had a camera in my hands because it was too fast to go in to get the camera. It was cloudy and the top of the craft was in the cloud but i saw the bottom and the lights, 2 white lights and in the front was a red one. If you want a picture contact me in e-mail ). Feel free. As i am writing this my pictures have not devoloped yet, but i will get them tomorrow. I can't wait! I hope this picture does not come out bad ). Ok sorry about that now back to the ufo stuff. I do not believe in aliens or nothing. I believe it was government type and i don't believe in aliens and i do not think they exist. Ufo's do!!!;35.1263388946818;-89.9382290928053
Pure machine- If it was ours it will be on Memphis approach radar or be given clearance to enter TCA for MEM.;2004-12-02 19:05:00;30 seconds;Pure machine- If it was ours it will be on Memphis approach radar or be given clearance to enter TCA for MEM. I was walking just after dark, gazing occasionally at the stars I realized that the three stars near the Eridanus constellation were repeated, except one was a little out of alignment. The stars began to move, take shape and formed a triangle with three lights, the craft then began a series of maneuvers without making a sound. The craft stood on end but floated slowly down, it momentarily was surrounded by a slight puff of white haze, the rear of the craft was slightly rounded, recessed from the end of the wing tips of the triangle. The craft 1/2 rolled and banked showing it's top, which was the blackest, black I have ever seen. If it had a windshield it did not show, it's lines were very low and defined. It came around me, climbing slowly, then went up, made a maneuver I can't understand except, it made a loop without changing direction of the front point of the craft and it went straight up out of sight. Every animal was making noise, dog barking, racoon screaming, birds night flying and my heart pounding. My hearing is outstanding and no noise, no exhaust trail, nothing!! If this is a secret project, I can't believe the spaceshuttle is patches, it wasn't a B-117A, B2, F/A-22 Raptor or anything I've read about, this thing was pure machine.;35.1263388946818;-89.9382290928053

The craft stoped and rotated and other lights were visable on the craft. The craft then proceeded to move in an eastward motionan. After it started the second time a second craft came in from the north going south under the first. The third craft was in the eastern sky aprox. 300ft in the sky and moved at a slower rate than the first. The first craft was aprox. 150 to 250 ft in the sky. They all had the same colors of light Bright white with some smaller blue and red. After 30 min of observation I notice the second craft in the south-west sky aprox. 200ft in the sky hovering and went streight op in the night.;35.1263388946818;-89.9382290928053

It had 3 white lights, one on each corner, and one red light at the bottom.   It was pretty big out of what I could see, definitely bigger than how an airplane would look if it were flying that high.

Grey triangle moving very fast at night, east to west in North Memphis;2019-08-24 21:30:00;15 seconds;Grey triangle moving very fast at night, east to west in North Memphis I was looking out across the field in front of my house and noticed a grey triangle shape moving across the top of the treeline (about 3/4 of a mile away).  It was moving extremely fast.  At first I thought it was just a cloud because it was grey in front of the black of the background sky.  But within a split second I realized hat it couldn't be a cloud because you just don't see triangle shaped clouds moving at approximately 1,000 mph.   Before i could grab a phone picture or do anything it disappeared into the blackness of the sky.  It was very weird. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
