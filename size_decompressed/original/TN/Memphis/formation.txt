One object joining 9 others to complete a triangular formation.;1969-10-13 22:00:00;1 hour;One object joining 9 others to complete a triangular formation. The date is approximate.  I saw the report from millington on this date and I remember something very similar.  Myself, my brother, 2 cousins and a friend were sleeping out in the back yard and were looking at a bright clear night sky.  I was about 11 years old.  I first saw a triangular formation of 9 crafts, red in color moving from south to north.  No blinking lights noted.  Was constant color of red.  To traverse the whole sky took about 1 hour.  As we watched, the formation looked like a rack of balls on a pool table missing the 1 ball at the front.  From nowhere, a single craft started moving toward the formation of 9.  That formation stopped, then one left that formation to join up with the single.  It looked like they were going to collide.  They did not.  These two, joined the others, and became a complete formation with the one joining at the front to complete it and continue across the sky.  We watched till they traversed across the whole sky to the northern horizon.  A note on my experience, I am ex USAF.  I have been in the aircraft industry for over 20 years professionally and still employed in the aircraft industry.  Am very familiar with all aircraft and flight dynamics.  I have studied flight since I was about 10 years old.  I know how aircraft act along with rotor craft.  This formation was way too high for that and NO sound was noted.

A formation of 3 objects in a straight line, unmoving, occasionally changing color.;2000-03-02 01:15:00;30 min +;A formation of 3 objects in a straight line, unmoving, occasionally changing color. I live in Southeast Shelby County.  I was looking to the West-Southwest at about 110 degree angle in the sky.  There were 3 green lights far overhead in a straight line formation running North to South with a little bit of a Northwest to Southeast slant.  We have an airport further to the west, but my father's a pilot and my husband works for Northwest and I KNOW these were not planes.  They stayed there unmoving.  They looked similar to stars, but as I watch the stars in that exact location every night, I can tell you that they were never there before or since. I am a 37 year old married female, computer systems administrator.  This is my first report of a UFO.  The objects seemed to blink clear or yellow , exactly together in sync, every once in a while, on a non-regular basis. There were aircraft out that night, but none near the objects.;35.1263388946818;-89.9382290928053
One large craft with a red light released six others. The crafts hovered for several minutes then disappeared.;2003-05-14 02:00:00;4 minutes;One large craft with a red light released six others. The crafts hovered for several minutes then disappeared. One large craft with a red light released six others, by my best count. I was able to observe the crafts for several minutes before they drifted out of my line of sight. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));35.1263388946818;-89.9382290928053

I took pictures and saw the orbs in one of my photos.  I was using my digital camera, and they are very obvious when you notice them.  It was a very gloomy overcast day.  They were white orbs, in some sort of formation.;35.1263388946818;-89.9382290928053
