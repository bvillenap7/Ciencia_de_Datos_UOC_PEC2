A beach ball white orb at tree tops level traveling south at 5mph.;1992-10-29 09:00:00;10 minutes;A beach ball white orb at tree tops level traveling south at 5mph. In the morning hours walking on Frayser Blvd, I noticed as beach ball size UFO at tree tops level cicular and white light and energy.  It was travelling 5mph south across the street headed to the center to the city of Memphis.  In numerology, the neighborhood &quotFrayser&quot equals 92 and this happened in 1992.

Blue-ish fireball speeds past the University of Memphis in winter of 1993-1994.;1993-06-15 03:00:00;few seconds;Blue-ish fireball speeds past the University of Memphis in winter of 1993-1994. A friend of mine and I were sitting on the curb of Central Ave at the northern end of the campus of the University of Memphis around 3 or 3:30 am in either November or December of 1993 (although it could be early '94--I do know that it was pretty cold so it was sometime in the winter).  No one was driving on the street or near the area we were at (virtually directly north of were the new university library is)--the area north of the campus is almost entirely residential with no bars, pool halls, or Greek houses, plus most students who are out at the strip are on the other side of campus and usually start to trickle home around 2am.  Essentially, the area my friend and I were in was totally deserted despite the fact that Central is a large 5 lane road when it passes the university. The sighting began when my friend asked for a cigarette: as I held one out to him, he looked in the general direction of my hand (towards the east).  Just above my hand, he later said, and down the street about a mile and a half he saw something headed our way and said what's that?  I turned and looked and saw a blue-ish fireball about a block and a half down the street headed in our direction.  This fireball was maybe 3 or 4 feet in diameter and was travelling pretty fast (approximately 40 to 50 mph) down what looked like the center line of the street.  When it passed above and in front of us, we noticed that it was at a heighth about 5 or 6 feet above the telephone poles that support a traffic light set up for students crossing the street (no cross street). As it passed, the fireball made a kind of hushed whooshing sound: similar to that of a cardboard tube when one swings the tube like a bat, but very subdued.  Also, the fireball had a short tail of blue-ish flame (about 5 feet), but left no smoke trail behind it.  The fireball zipped by us and continued down the street to the west until it was out of sight. I'm not sure if what we saw was ball lightning or something different and possibly more exotic, but I thought it might be worthwhile to let somebody know about this just to see if anyone else saw the same thing...I find it hard to believe that my friend and I were the only people to have seen this thing.;35.1263388946818;-89.9382290928053
Large green fireball with sparks trailing behind;2008-04-27 20:45:00;15 sec;Large green fireball with sparks trailing behind I was walking on the golf course next to my mother in law's apartment. At first I was looking straight ahead, but all of the sudden a large green fireball about 50 times the size of a normal star averted my attention to the sky. The object was bright green fire that came to a point at the tail end. It had sparks flailing off of the it as it shot across the sky. I was on the phone with my boyfriend who was delivering pizzas across town and he saw the same thing, and we are at least 30 miles away from each other. His experience was that he saw the fireball separate into four different distinct smaller objects, only to converge seconds later back into one fireball before disappearing. The speed of the object was much faster than a plane, but it lingered in the sky for at least 20 seconds before completely disappearing. There was no sound, and it did not breach the horizon, it simply disappeared! I'm freaked out.;35.1263388946818;-89.9382290928053
Bright glowing green sphere that vanishes, very close and very big.  ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  PD));2009-08-28 01:15:00;1 second;Bright glowing green sphere that vanishes, very close and very big I was sitting in the car with my boyfriend and looking at the stars out my window when a bright almost neon green ball flashes across the sky.  My boyfriend saw the light but wasnt lookin in the same direction to see the object.  It had a dark green core with glowing green around it and was HUGE.   This was not something that happened way up in the sky where you would normally see stars.  This was abouve some trees in the distance and when I went back out the next morning trying to judge how far away this ball was in refrence to the clouds, the clouds seem to be much further away.  Which made me question that this wasnt something burning while entering our atmosphere.  I'd really like to know what this was.  The best way to describe the movement was that it kind of fell in the sky and disappeared before the treetops.  Disappeared in mid air! ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.

There was a aura or haze around the fireball with a tail.;2012-12-01 19:45:00;30-40 seconds;There was a aura or haze around the fireball with a tail. I just pulled into my driveway and exited my vehicle.  Upon getting out I looked up and saw four to six fire ball shaped objects flying fairly low and not very fast.  Then approximately 100-200 yards behind were two more bringing up the rear.  All objects were heading north.;35.1263388946818;-89.9382290928053
