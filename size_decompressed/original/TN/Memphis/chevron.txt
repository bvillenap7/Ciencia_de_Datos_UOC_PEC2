One object sited passing inderectly over my house, heading north/north east slowly and at an extremely low elevation.  I viewed it from my back patio as it passed over.  The time was right about midnight. My best guess would be that it was atleast two or three hundred feet in elevation.  It's shape, as near as I can explain it, was a three dimensional horizontal triangular shape which ended in vertical cylinders in a wide U shape.  The entire object glowed a dull greenish/yellow with no flashing lights, and moved rather slowly.  I didn't see any exhaust trail or anything indicating an engine exhaust at all.  I discounted it's being a blimp, since I never heard any noise from the object.  The object maintained it's speed, elevation, and direction for as long as I was able to view it.;35.1263388946818;-89.9382290928053
Cluster of Orbs followed by formation of single Orbs;2004-08-08 23:00:00;3 minutes;Cluster of Orbs followed by formation of single Orbs I noticed what at first appeared to be a cluster of ballons floating about 1000 feet in the air, upon closer observation I noticed that about 16 other orb shaped objects were following the larger cluster. The very odd thing about it was they stayed in a perfect formation and when observing it moving in a southwesternly direction(against the wind) the formation it self seemed to be solid as it went past stars (you can make out in the city) it eclipsed them. It moved slowely the entire time. A co-worker and myself both watched it move out of sight behind some trees. This was in Midtown Memphis so I'm sure more than myself and co-worker say it. Hopefully someone else saw this eith on Radar or visually. It had to be at least 50 yards in length and width;35.1263388946818;-89.9382290928053
A chevron shaped object with red circular lights underneath flew ever so smoothly  and quietly  in the sky.;2012-07-15 02:30:00;1 minute;A chevron shaped object with red circular lights underneath flew ever so smoothly  and quietly  in the sky. It was around 2:30 am and I was taking the trash out in the back of my apartment at the time. Something moving  caught my attention out of the corner of my eye. There were very tall trees which , at first, made me think I was seeing a very large bird  like an eagle or an owl with its wings spread out . It was hard to make out what it was as it was almost colorless . When my eyes finally focused in on it I could see it was a V shaped object. It was very smooth with its flying, as well as quiet. When it came closer,I could see that it had red circular lights under it, one in the front center of the V and two going down each under side Before it got directly above me it turned( smoothly and quietly) towards the river downtown and sped off.;35.1263388946818;-89.9382290928053
Black or grey large Boomerang-shaped object flew over mississippi river at night. No lights and completely silent.;2015-03-15 22:30:00;4 minutes;Black or grey large Boomerang-shaped object flew over mississippi river at night. No lights and completely silent. We were sitting on a roof just east of the Mississippi river stargazing.  We then noticed this black object moving in the sky.  The object was somewhat difficult to see because it was black with no lights, but it was undoubtedly there.  It seemed to be in the shape of a boomerang or plane and it was rather large.  Three of us watched as it flew rather slowly and silently north.;35.1263388946818;-89.9382290928053
Inverted cigar shaped or straightened chevron brightly glowing object passed east to west then vanished over river;2018-05-19 21:15:00;5 minutes;Inverted cigar shaped or straightened chevron brightly glowing object passed east to west then vanished over river Driving west on North Parkway with my GF, in between East Parkway and Watkins.  We had been watching this thing for a couple of minutes.  This was certainly no drone, plane, helicopter, Chinese lantern, satellite or anything of conventional explanation.  Almost chevron shaped but straighter with a less defined apex to the angle of the shape. Very bright, totally silent, and appeared to be on fire but there was no trail or tail and it moved at a very steady but slow speed.  It could not have been a drone because we watched it vanish somewhere over downtown Memphis or maybe even over the river into Arkansas.  Our phone was dead and we left the charger at home.  No clouds for it to vanish into. When it was right above us it was so much brighter than anything else in the sky.  I've never seen anything like this.  I would say it was a fireball but the shape was wrong.  Also...the entire object was illuminated as if glowing brightly or on fire as opposed to something that had lights on it.;35.1263388946818;-89.9382290928053
