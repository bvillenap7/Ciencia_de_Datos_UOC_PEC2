Bright white light in rural area of Memphis in 1976 responds to kid's and their sealed beam flashlight.;1976-07-15 21:30:00;5-7 minutes;Bright white light in rural area of Memphis in 1976 responds to kid's and their sealed beam flashlight. Myself, two friends and the mother of one of those friends witnessed in the summer of 1976 an unusually bright, white light moving extremely slow from south to north just above the trees and it seemed to be moving parallel to a fairly new street that ran through our neighborhood. It had just become dark (around 9 pm, the time we had to be back in our parent's sight)and my friends and I had begun settling down for the night on the front porch and were repairing our bicycles after a long hard day of BMXing and Evel Keneveling. We had our bicycles under extreme maintenance and one of us lost a small part in the shrubbery around the porch. One friend went down two doors to his home and returned with a 12 volt sealed beam lantern. We were looking for the part for several minutes and then found it.  As I got up and walked out on the sidewalk in front of the house, I looked to the east and noticed this bright light hanging in the sky just behind the very top of a tree. I said nothing and went back to my mechanic duties when my friend noticed it a few seconds later. She asked if that was the police helicopter that had frequented our neighborhood on regular patrol during the summers. (We would run out in the street and wave at the pilots and they would blink the carbon-arc spot at us to say hello. Those were the days...). Curiously I looked again to see if that was the same light I had noticed a few seconds earlier and it was. I said that if that were the helicopter, we would here it as close as it was like we always did. My other friend, with sealed beam flashlight still in hand, turned it on and shined it on the object through the tree top. I told him I didn't think that was a good idea, but he being a year older (15), over rode that idea and did it anyway.  At this point the object slowly moved out from behind the tree top as if to get a better look at us or our light source and just hung there quietly.  He turned off his light, and about 2 seconds later the object began to move and he shined his light on it again and it stopped. I excitedly told my other friend to get our parents and she ran in and only returned with her mother.  She saw the object and assured us it was an airplane or our helicopter friends until we questioned her as to where the moving BEAM of blue-white light was and pointed out that the white light was WAY too bright for normal running lights on an airplane, it was WAY too low to be an aircraft of any kind without making noise or kicking up dust.  It was not until my older friend  said, ...and watch this. as he shined his light on it again and it began to slowly move (east) our way that she was convinced and noticeably shaken when he turned off the light and the object stopped! Here she nervously ordered us all in the house (mine being the closest)and to my parents surprise who thought were playing jokes. She also told them something strange was low in the sky and relatively close but they, still showing no interest chose not to investigate. We all four returned to the porch expecting it to be gone saw it still quietly hanging in the sky right where we left it.  We studied it for about 30 seconds when it began to move north. My older friend again shined his bright flashlight toward the object and it stopped once again.  We were all beginning to become concerned at this time when it began to resume it's northward course along a north-south street but slowly gaining altitude until it got to which is now by my estimation, 50-60 feet above the rooftops.  My older friend tried to chase it on his bicycle for a closer look and my other friend and I scaled a brick swimming pool fence and stood atop it to get a better look as it flew off over the neighborhood and sped out of sight within 1 or 2 seconds and disappearing after making an extremely sharp turn to the west. My friend's mother then used our phone to call Memphis International tower to see if anything was flying around our area. After what seemed to me to be about 15 minutes on the phone with them they said they could find nothing unusual. She retold these events to my parents as we kids returned to the front porch hoping it would come back but as far as I know, none of us ever spoke of this event again among ourselves or to anyone else. I'm just wondering if I am the only one that remembers this now.... ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));35.1263388946818;-89.9382290928053

On one night, these lights appeared to be performing some sort of synchronized movements, moving in large circles at antipodes from each other, and reversing direction. I just finished watching the special on the Discovery channel about the lights seen over Phoenix during March of '97. I was impressed by the videos of the supposed 'flares', and was reminded of a similar occurance many years ago. Over the course of the month of January 1988, only on weekend nights as these were the only nights I was out, I witnessed in the western sky over Memphis, sometimes 2, and sometimes 4, bright amber lights similar in appearance, color, and 'texture' to flames seen from a great distance. Each night after 0100, while driving south down Old Germantown Road, I saw these lights above the western horizon, in the direction of Memphis International Airport. Sometimes the lights merely hovered, or moved very slowly, almost too slow to notice movement, but on one occasion, my curiosity having been excited by previous sightings, I noticed two objects moving in a large circle, as though orbiting a central point- the circle being approxiamtely 3x the size of a fu! ll moon. The objects maintained a 180 degree opposition to each other as they circled, and once a circle was completed, they reversed direction to complete another circle, before reversing direction again. On this particular night (I cannot remember the exact date), I stopped the car to watch them, and sat parked for about 15 minutes before I got bored, having watched them perform 3 complete circles, so i continued on my way, sure that I would see them again on some other night. And I did, but never again were they so active as on that night. Since then I have seen similar phenomena which proved to be landing lights of comercial aircraft approaching over a great distance on a clear night: the same color and quality of light, the same apparent slow movement, but I have never before or since witnessed such a 'ballet' in the sky. It seems remarkable and highly unlikely that any comercial or military aircraft could move with such precision being separated over so large an area as ! was suggested by the apparent distance from my vantage point, and even more unlikley that such aircraft could stop and reverse direction without slowing.  I have never before reported this because it seemed to me too weak a sighting to be of much consequence I was never able to identify the objects as anything more than 'lights in the sky.' But after seeing the Phoenix videotapes, I was amazed by the similarity to what I saw over those nights so long ago. These were not my only encounters during the same 12-month period, but it has been so long now, I don't that my information can be of much value. I am, however, interested in relating what I have seen, both in the sky and elsewhere, to interested scientific and documentary authorities.  If needed, i can supply photocopies of maps showing my position and the direction of the sightings.;35.1263388946818;-89.9382290928053
UFO over Memphis;2000-09-30 20:00:00;1-2 min.;UFO over Memphis We were attending the Mid-South Fair in Memphis, TN, when my wife looked up and saw an object. She pointed it out to me, I saw a dimly lit object, it appeared to be as large as a commercial aircraft that we had seen in the area earlier, as we were in the flight path of Memphis airport. It didn't display any FAA lighting. I could easily judge it's relative size. This object was displaying only a dim gray colored light and it moved quickly from northeast to the Southwest.  It covered the sky from where we first saw it to the horizon in less then 15 seconds. I observed several normal aircraft in the area at the time of my sighting, including a police helicopter.

Star-like object moves slowly and hovers at high altitude over Memphis at mid-day.;2001-10-28 13:00:00;1/2 hour;Star-like object moves slowly and hovers at high altitude over Memphis at mid-day. The incident took place in mid-day under clear skies. While in my backyard, I saw a commercial aircraft going overhead apparently only moments after take off from the local airport. I glanced up at the plane and noticed, in the blue sky at a much higher altitude, a star like object. Had the plane not passed over, I probably would never have noticed the object. It looked like a star of average brightness, but this was 1 in the afternoon, and the only object of its kind visible. The object moved very slowly from east to west, perhaps slightly southwest. At one point, the object abruptly changed its course and moved south for about one minute. Then it once again resumed its westerly course. As I said, the object moved at what appeared to be a very low speed and was at high altitude. While watching, I observed two high flying commercial jets flying over Memphis, apparently bypassing the city enroute to other destinations. These planes were leaving contrails, but appeared to be at a lower altitude than the object. They were also moving at a considerably higher speed than the object. At one point the object came to a dead stop in the sky. It appeared to hover over what appeared to be the center of the city for at least ten minutes. It was absolutely stationary. It then resumed its westerly course. There were no erratic manuevers or sudden changes in speed other other than the 10 minute period of hovering and the brief change of direction to the south I mentioned. The object moved in straight lines. I ruled out a balloon figuring winds at such an altitude would have driven the object across the sky at a much faster rate, and balloons tend not to hover and remain stationary for ten minutes at a time. The entire sighting lasted aproximately 30 minutes and the object could not have covered more than 45-50 degrees of arc in the sky during this time. It did not appear to emit light of its own. It reflected sunlight and the intensity of the reflection varied as it moved across the sky. I am not a trained observer, but if this object was indeed as high as I thought, flying higher than airliners bypassing Memphis, it must have been  a rather large craft based on the intensity of the reflection. I followed its course with the naked eye until I lost sight of it as it moved into the path of the sun.;35.1263388946818;-89.9382290928053
The international space station was being followed by another vehicle of sorts.;2002-09-27 19:51:00;20 SECS.;The international space station was being followed by another vehicle of sorts. At 7:51 P.M. CDST my mother and I were in her back yard watching the space station flying directly over head from a southwest to a notheast direction. The entire time we were viewing the object, we were also viewing another object following the space station keeping the same distance always. The station looked bigger and whiter than the second vehicle being smaller with dimmer white light. The two could have been at different altitudes? If one were to take both fists, join them together at t,he thumb knuckles and hold them up to the sky at arms length, and another doing the same as you, with both sets of fists touching pinkie fingers, side-by-side, that was the approximate distance by which the second vehicle was trailing the station and matching it's speed. We were both stone cold sober. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness is correct.  ISS passed just south of Memphis at 19:49-19:54 hrs. on this date.  We do not know what the second object was in formation with the ISS, but it may have been a Russian Progress re-supply capsule.

I have never seen a weather balloon change colors and be bright enough to be seen at night, and travel at 500 mph.;2003-11-27 18:45:00;30-40 minutes;I have never seen a weather balloon change colors and be bright enough to be seen at night, and travel at 500 mph. On November 27th 2003 I was flying from Pittsburgh PA. to Memphis TN.  I am an airline pilot.  We were on top of a cloud layer at appox. 30,000 feet, and had unlimited visibility above in all directions.  At just about the half way point of the flight (approx. 18:45 local time) I noticed a bright object above the horizon.  Thinking it was just a planet, I didn't give it a second glance.  About 10 minutes after I had first noticed the object, I saw my captain adjusting our TCAS (traffic collision avoidance system) to the farthest setting of 80 miles.  I then looked out at the object and it was now below the horizon.  I asked the captain if he was trying to see if the object was an aircraft using our TCAS.  He said yes.  The object which appeared to be approximately 20-40 miles in front of us was now changing colors from it's original white, to red and green.  At first we thought it was just another aircraft with it's anti-collision lights on until the color changes.  I was handling the radios and decided to ask air traffic control if we had any aircraft in front of us at a range of 20-40 miles.  His reply was that we didn't have any traffic within 80 miles of our position.  He asked me to describe the object, which I did, and then he proceeded to contact another aircraft that was at our 9 o'clock position and 80 miles from us, to see if they saw the object that I described.  They (the other aircraft) responded that they saw the same thing.  We never gained any ground on the object and as we started our decent to Memphis, the object in front of us did the same.  The object went into the cloud layer and we never saw it again.  The air traffic controller told us to keep him informed and that the object was most likely a weather balloon.;35.1263388946818;-89.9382290928053

Also, i was in the u.s. army and have seen aircraft at this altitude and know at what altitude paratroopers jump from, and the object was in this range, as i have jumped from. This object traveled MUCH slower than any aircraft I have ever seen.  So slow in fact that I had figured if it were one of ours, it would have stalled.  The object passed over head without a sound.  It then dimmed from a bright white light to an ever diminishing nothing.  It was gone without a bit of reflection or an sound.  The brilliance never changed, just dimmed.

As I looked in the sky, I seen a multitude of blurry lights shooting from behind the clouds as if they were released from something & flying really fast above my home & disappearing. I couldn't tell exactly were they were coming from because there was a huge tree blocking my view, but it was definitely from behind the clouds. The lights continued to fly from behind the clouds for about an hour. It is really hard to describe, but I have never been so frightened in my entire life. I never believed in flying objects or ufo's, so this is very scary to me. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Last night me and my two daughter's had just come from the corner store, they had gone in the house already and I was left outside I had to close my gate to my car. I was on my way in the house I just so happen to look up and saw what I thought was a high flying airplane. Well after about 1 min past this blinking light came from the east of me and I was about to go in the house when out of no-were another blinking light came from the west of the other light and they meet and in line of each other and I was like OMG these two planes are going to crash? I then ran to my door and called for one of my daughter's to come see she is fourteen years old and she came out and ask me what was I looking at and I said look at those two lights? She said I don't think those are airplanes? I said I know look how fast the lights are blinking? She said they look like UFO'S I ask her how do you know what it look like? And she said I've seen them on TV? And the one's I've seen ! on TV look just like these? By then my 9yr old came outside and ask what's up there in the sky mom? I said it look like a UFO or airplane? And even my baby said mama look at those lights over there and it was another blinking light they were blinking off and on so fast it was so amazing to us. After about 7 or 8 min we all went in the house because they the lights went over behind the trees and we could not see them anymore. After I got in the house I wanted to see them again so I was getting ready for the bed and happen to look out my bedroon window and the same two lights that we saw at first was back out over the top of the trees that I can see from my bedroom window, I called my daughter to my window and we watch them for about 3min and they just blinked out. I hope that someone else saw what we saw, I'm just glad I wasn't the only person that saw these lights. The fast flying lights were to far away for me to record it on my cell-phone, I was trying to record it.;35.1263388946818;-89.9382290928053

At 2029 Central Standard Time, I observed 5 orange lights coming over the apartment North of me.  They appeared one at a time, about 6 to 9 inches apart.   The orange lights began bright, with rays of orange light coming from each one but at different angles.  The objects moved slowly S-SW not in a straight line, more like two patterns one almost due south and the other angled more SW (alternating).   After moving a foot in the sky, the lights (one at time, the lead one) would begin to flicker for 1 to 3 seconds.  Then the orange light was gone and a faint white light appeared instead.   There was a a slightly oval clear outline like a contact lens around these white lights which moved faster and faster.  The speed quadrupled in the next two feet.  This ended at 2031 Central Standard Time.  The objects were also ascending while picking up speed.;35.1263388946818;-89.9382290928053

I stepped outside upon returning to my home near the University of Memphis, lit a cigarette, and looked into the sky, a habit of mine since I have always been interested in astronomy.  The sky was clear, dark, and surprisingly, for a Friday night.  I could see an unusual amount of stars.   But one light, which appeared to be a star was moving across the sky slowly, but fast enough to recognize it was indeed moving.  I stared at it, looked around, walked onto the street to get a better view, and looked up again.  It was still hovering, at a fairly consistent speed headed southeast from my vantage point.   I pulled out my phone to take a video, but I could not get enough exposure so i put it up.  Then all of the sudden, like the flick of a light switch, it was gone.  I looked all over the sky for another sign, but failed to.   So i called my friend who I was texting to tell him about what I believed was a ufo, and as I was talking to him, another light, with the s! ame brightness and size sped across the sky, almost as fast as a meteor that reaches the atmosphere.
