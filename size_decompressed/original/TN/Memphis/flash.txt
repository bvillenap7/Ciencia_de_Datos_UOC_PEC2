It kept flashing and then it looked like I saw a oval craft. When I got to the end of Farm Road, it just disapperared in the sky. I was on my way to my grandmum's to pick my mother up. I was driving down Farm Rd, which is by the County's Penal Farm. At 5:41 am, my car's radio went haywire and just stopped.My lights on my car went very low and my spedomitor went nuts. I looked up in the sky and saw this bright light..... as it sped up higher, I could see a oval -like craft and it had this pinkish-green light around it. I was trying to keep my car going and I noticed  that it just would go higher and then come down and the closer it got, the colors became brighter and the car would act up worse. When I got to the end of Farm RD, the object disappered in a flash of light. And exactly 4 min had passed. My car resumed being normal and I quickly drove off to get to where i had to be.;35.1263388946818;-89.9382290928053

Bright light S of the Memphis-MS border that when viewed through a cell...can see it's actually moving fast.((NUFORC Note:  Sirius? PD);2017-02-19 22:04:00;Ongoing;Bright light South of the Memphis-Mississippi border that when viewed through a cell...can seeits actually moving fast..vanishing and I saw what appeared to be an airplane to the North of my house Friday, Feb 17th 2017, but it was not moving.  I used the guide of a tree to verify it wasnt moving. Tonight, my neighbor told my husband to come out side and look at this object tonthe South of our house. I noticed it was the same appearance as what I saw Friday night. My neighbor though it was something doing surveillance. It doeant look like a star and it appears to be a bright light..or several bright lights in a row to make one. It is 10:10 PM as I type this and I have been recording it for over an hour. It moves similar to a flash light being waved spraticly in the dark and then it fizzles away and disappears...only to reappear a second later. I wish I could notify someone to docuement this better than I can...as I am using a LG Stylo 2 cell phone and have made numerous vidios over the past hour. By my naked eye, I can barely tell its moving, and it doesnt appear by naked eye to move a grea! t distance but with my cell recording it, I am able to see it moving extremely fast sparaticly, actually disappearing only to reappear similar to a light splat. I emailed my local news to tell them what I am seeing and asked if they would also record it because thry might possibly be able to get better footage with a professional, high grade camera versus a LG cell phone. I have never ever experienced anything like this...and wasnt a believer in UFO's. Ironically, my 8 year old son has been watching u_ _ _ _ videos on UFO's and has been terrified to go to sleep the last few nights and I just finished telling him they dont exist...and if they did...they sure wouldn't come to Memphis where it's so populated and so much crime....I joked and alian would grt shot here..lol. This is unbelievably the most interesting thing I have ever seen. If anyone would like to see the footage I have, I'll gladly post or send it. I am going to keep recording it every night while it's here. I a! m 8 months pregnant and have to be up and at work in the morni! ng. I wi ll do one more recording before I go to bed. I wish someone could point me in the right direction of someone local to confirm this sighting! Anyone in my area of South Memphis...specifically Whitehaven, a half mile from the Mississippi border looking South. There are 3 stars that form a triangle to the left of it and 3 starsin a straight line to the right of it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
