40 to 50 objects hovering over memphis tennessee;2013-04-22 22:00:00;2 hours;40 to 50 objects hovering over memphis tennessee me, my wife and daughter were driving from memphis to collierville corinth ms and i realized that there was an unidetified object just hovering right over byhalia. we were coming to all kinds of conclusions, helicopters or jets etc. but then we noticed atleast 30 more over the freeway pointing towards our way. they had red and white lights but you could tell that they werent normal lights. the lights were traveling around the object very fast as if it was only one light, and the red ones were just blinking. as i was looking at the first one we seen it was like it knew we was looking at it and flashed a light as if it winked at me. and even when i got to corinth ms i could still see them far out just hovering. they were so close together and so close to the ground that it was unbelievable! planes and helicopters make noises but these obvjects were quiet, no noise at all. i think theyre planning something just waiting for the right time to pop it off. they wer! e diamond shaped objects. it was just crazy. i searched on the internet to see if anyone else seen the objects but, nothing. i tried recording the objects but my phone mysteriously shut down! ive always been aware of the fact that they were out there but no one else ever believed me, even my wife! but now she knows that im not crazy. they were lined up for a while as if in formation. it was like we was walking down the aisle on the freeway.;35.1263388946818;-89.9382290928053
Diamond shaped objects hoving over highway in and near Memphis;2016-08-15 23:45:00;~15 minutes;Diamond shaped objects hoving over highway in and near Memphis My wife, two adult children and I were driving from San Antonio, Texas, back to KY on 8/15/2016.  We arrived in Memphis between 23:30 and 23:45 on I-40.  While leaving Memphis on I-40 going towards Nashville, we witnessed a large diamond shaped object, hovering approximately 1000 feet above the highway.  It had several bright lights that alternating from a steady burn to a flickering behavior.  There was one red light that remained fairly constant.   We continued to drive because there was no place to pull over at that point on the interstate.   We witnessed approximately 8 or 9 more more similar objects spread over the next 8 to 10 miles of highway.   I was finally able to exit the highway and pull into a gas station where I got some mobile phone video and a photo of the last one.   We then continued on towards Nashville, and eventually took I-65 towards Louisville, KY. We were just south of the Elizabeth Town, KY, exit, when we witnessed another, identical, object hovering to the west of I-65.   We continued on to the Lexington, KY, area, with no further encounters.;35.1263388946818;-89.9382290928053
