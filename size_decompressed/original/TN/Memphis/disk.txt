Mothership Sighting over Memphis Tennesee on February 14, 1976;1976-02-14 18:00:00;2 minutes;Mothership Sighting over Memphis Tennesee on February 14, 1976 In February 1976, I was enroute from San Francisco to New Jersey to work on constructing a nuclear power plant.  I am a graduate civil engineer and I was employed as an upper level engineer by an international engineering-construction company who had transferred me from the Trans Alaska Pipeline to this nuclear power project in New Jersey. I was on the interstate bridge that crossed the Mississippi River driving east near sunset on Saturday, February 14, 1976, in Memphis, Tennessee.  This was the first time I had seen the Mississippi River.  As I was taking in the sights, I noticed a large structure in the distance that was slowly revolving and had slowly pulsing lights, much like a communication tower but it was too broad, it was rotating and it had multi-colored pulsing lights.  That caught my eye.  I was looking east at the structure away from the sunset so it was hard to see the mass of the structure. The portion of the structure I could see was about a thousand feet above the ground.  The structure  (defined by a dim outline and the pulsing lights) made a precise vertical rise of an estimated 200-300 hundred feet and then a precise vertical descent of about the same distance.  At this point I was straining to see what supported this structure that was making this precise movement.  I could not see any mass or structural support under the portion defined by the dim outline of the objec's mass and the pulsing lights.  I realized then this was not a structure but it was an object and there was nothing supporting it.  It then began an exact horizontal movement to the west for a few hundred feet and then an exact horizontal movement to the east. I decided to get off the interstate and get directly underneath the object to get a better look at it and to confirm to myself there was no structural support from the ground.  As I was exiting the interstate, the object began an exact horizontal move to the west.  Theobjec moved slowly at first, then accelerated at an astonishing rate of speed toward the west until it disappeared from sight. The sun was still visible in the west.  The speed of its departure was so quick that I was still on the exit ramp while watching it disappear in the distance.  I heard no sound from its departure nor did I see any evidence of propulsion devices. I later performed a calculation to estimate the average speed at which the object departed.  I estimate that the time it took to travel from a standstill until it disappeared from sight in the west was at least 2 seconds but not more than 4 seconds.  The visibility was at least 100 miles and probably more.  That means the AVERAGE speed the object traveled in this distance was at least 90,000 mph and possibly 180,000 mph.  If the visibility was 200 miles, these speeds would be doubled to 180,000 mph minimum and possibly 360,000 mph. Description of object  The mass of the object was difficult to see when I was viewing it in the east and it departed so quickly that I only viewed the mass for a few seconds.  However, this is what I saw.  The object was disc shaped.  I estimate its girth at 300-400 feet.  The thickness at the middle of the disc was around 100 feet.  I believe the object to be circular at its girth as it was slowly rotating without any change in its outline.  It had multi-colored slowly pulsing lights (yellow, green, and red) on its girth and elsewhere on the mass. I continued traveling on the interstate for a few more hours and spent the night a couple of hundred miles east of Memphis, Tennessee.  I could not obtain a copy of any of the Memphis newspapers to find out if the sighting was reported and published. I have not been back to Memphis since then, but I always hoped to be able to return there some day and research the archive newspapers to read about the sighting. With the advent of the Internet, I performed a search for UFO sightings on the 2/14/76 date to see if someone else had witnessed and recorded the sighting.  The only information I found was about a UFO Crash near Cubatao River, Brazil 2/14/76 recorded by ((a well-known UFO investigator)).  At the rate of speed I observed the object to be capable of traveling, it could very easily have traveled from Memphis to Brazil in a few minutes.  I tried to find out more information about the crash in Brazil but to date I have been unsuccessful. I certainly would appreciate a response from anyone who (or knows of anyone who) experienced the Memphis, Tennessee UFO, or who knows about the Brazil UFO crash. I hope to hear from someone.;35.1263388946818;-89.9382290928053
6 witnesses, one goes into complete denial, occurs in a populated urban environment.;1995-08-07 17:00:00;2-3 minutes;6 witnesses, one goes into complete denial, occurs in a populated urban environment. Summer 1995 Memphis, Tn.  I'm at work with several other people. Slow day, so a few of us are hangin' around outside helping one of the guys work on his car. We are in the parking lot of a small strip-mall. (Not all of these sightings happen out in cow country.) Two of us go inside to get a few sodas, on our way way back outside we hear one of the others yelling Get out here, you gotta see this sh*t! We ran. It sounded like an emergency from the tone of voice. So there we are a group of five all pointing up at the sky slack-jawed. The traffic just keeps goin' by like theres not any UFOs dancing around in the sunset.  There were 3 craft from what we could tell. Each identical to the other, they were shaped like a discus and appeared to be a metallic color with a soft glowin' white halo that surrounded them. They flew in perfect unison and in ways that seemed impossible, especially to what we know of as vehicular flight. It only lasted a minute or two but the lil' airshow was spectacular. As they flew away (quite fast), it was like all 3 ships flew into each other and became one burst of light... poof... gone.  One of the guys, the manager, comes out just in time to see the last half of it. He drops whatever he was holding. This is were I get confused. He can't believe what he sees... even while 5 of us point it out. He goes into complete denial on the spot. To this day I'm sure he wouldn't admit to it. He didn't go into hysterics or anything like that, its just that He went back inside saying No. Nope. No way. Which was actually stranger than seeing what were probably our own creation. I should note that this happened not far from the Millington Navy Airbase NAS Memphis. (Formerly the largest by enrollment and most active training center for new Navy & Marine pilots.)  We stood around outside, looking up & talking for several minutes afterward making sure that we all saw the same thing.

Highly reflective 'fat' disk-shaped object 1,000ft off ground flying perpendicular to ground (not parallel) i.e. on end at a 45 degeree angle approx. 2 miles away.  The UFO flew 500ft. under a Fed Ex MD11 wide body jet descending to land on glide path.  The Fed Ex MD11 was flying just under 200mph to south.  UFO traveling same speed to north east.  Could not be an aircraft banking or a mylar type balloon due to shape and size viz. 1/3 to 1/2 the size of the MD11.  Also, UFO did not behave as a balloon or kite i.e flapping, waving or oscillaing in wind.  UFO flew straight, level trajectory at approx. 1,000ft. and disappeared above a tree line to the north east.  As UFO passed by and the angle changed, I could see that it was definitely spherical but disk-shaped.  Also, the brilliance of the reflection did not change as the angle to sight changed.  UFO was silent and demonstrated no evudence of propulsion, but demonstrated controled flight & trajectory.;35.1263388946818;-89.9382290928053
Huge disk seen hovering dead still in sky with 6 white lights on bottom and rotating red lights, Memphis, TN;2005-04-01 01:00:00;3 min;Huge disk seen hovering dead still in sky with 6 white lights on bottom and rotating red lights, Memphis, TN I was smoking a cig in front yard looking in the sky.  All of sudden 6 bright white lights turned on in the sky directly above me.  I was maybe 30 feet from being directly underneath it.  It just floated and made no noise at all and i was very scared.  Then a min into it a red light started going around the disk in a counter clockwise motion, every second, all the way around on the part of disk that goes from the bottom part up. This totally freaked me out and I ran inside to get my mom to show her.  When we got outside....1 min later...it had to be 20 miles away headed towards Frayser (memphis area) but still very visible in plain view and mother saw it and ran inside scared.....this object was as big as 3 planes probably.  Then later on during the night i heard a high pitched ZzZzZzZ noise in my head and just knew the thing was back, but i was to scared to go outside. I ran around the house knowing it was out there.   The noise reoccured at on other point during the night. I got up both times it happened. The sheets were sticking to me cause of all the sweating i was doing.  The last time i was up i had a lighter than air feeling occur to me, really hard to explain.  Then after a few days i completly pushed it out of my memmory untill recently.  I could never convince anyone about what i saw except my mom cause she saw it.  I have never seen anything before and doubt i will again.  But this was the wildest experience in my life.

Green disk;2007-05-11 04:30:00;2 mins;Green disk Left my home on the way to work at 400am that day.  Had been awake since 230 am.  On the way to work I noticed a object overing in front of my vehicle in the sky quite a distance up.  I pulled my truck over to get a better view, it allowed me to watch maybe for a minute tops.  At which time it zoomed off in a northeastern direction at a very high rate of speed.  I have seen UFO's before but never one like this.  It was the traditional Disk, but it was glowing green.  I was on a rural road and there was no noise what so ever.  It zoomed off at such a high rate of speed that all I could see what a blur.;35.1263388946818;-89.9382290928053

Today I witnessed a UF0, on Winchester and Mendenhall in East Memphis.  ((anonymous report));2016-05-06 11:23:00;unknown;Today I witnessed a UF0, on Winchester and Mendenhall in East Memphis. Hello, Everyone!  Today I witnessed a UF0 on Winchester and Mendenhall in East Memphis.  My boyfriend and I were in the turning lane when I noticed a reflection in the sky.  The reflection looked as if someone were beaming a mirror towards the sun.  Once the bright reflection went away I swear on my soul there was a saucer hovering in the sky for at least 3 minutes.   My boyfriend and I couldn't believe are eyes!!!  I tried to take a picture, but when I went for my phone it was dead.  Once we turned at the light it turned back to a reflection and disappeared.  Never seen anything like it, but i've seen quite a few UFO'S from Washington State, but this is my first encounter in Tennessee!
