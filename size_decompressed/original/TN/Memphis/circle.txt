Round circular object, small cross section;2003-10-20 16:05:00;15 minutes;Round circular object, small cross section Clear day with small patch of cirrus clouds overhead.  My friend asked what that was over my right shoulder just above the tree tops.  The event occurred next to the Memphis Airport, 1/2 mile west and about 3 miles south of us.  I turned and observed a Black round object facing me about 5 miles sse just observed over the tree tops.  We thought it was a large bird circling.  It was not.  As the round portion turned downward, we saw a cross section very thin that made the object appear to disappear.  As it continued to turn or move, the what I call top portion turned toward the sun and was very reflective.  It appeared to be silver, yellowish, and had what looked like a structure or beam across the top red in color.  It was going in a NE direction very slowly and rising slowly.  As it continued a tumbling motion, the top portion fully faced us.  We observed the red beam and the color of the top appeared to be yellowish.  It continued to do a tumbling motion.  We observed what I call the bottom, it was all black and round.  As it went over the airport, appeared to move north.  When it looked like it was almost past the airport, at about 3-4000 FT, a small aircraft moved below it at about 2,000 Ft.  Once that aircraft moved away, the object appeared to go NE and gain altitude slowly.  At no time did we observe noise from this craft, no lights, no string or rope.  We watched it till it got so far we couldn't see it anymore.  Once we went inside, I called the control tower to see if they have anything or observe anything.  Nothing noted from them.  Note: I work in the aviation industry, am a veteran and had a similar job in the USAF.  Have been a aviation buff for over 30 years.  I know the sound of aircraft, navigation lights, etc as this is a part of my job.  If this was a balloon, it would have to have been a very large one and at least round on the bottom, top, and have a very small cross section.  It would also have to tumble in the wind and go with the wind.  The wind was out of the SW t! o W at 10-15 knots.;35.1263388946818;-89.9382290928053
Gigantic round object with intense bright light moving thounsands of MPH;2008-01-09 17:00:00;1-2 minutes;Gigantic round object with intense bright light moving thousands of MPH At around 5:00 am (11:00 zulu) just south of Memphis a very bright light appeared from 240 degrees moving to about 060 degrees at an altitude of 200 to 300 miles high.  The object was round and very bright moving at a speed of several thousand miles per hour.  I could compare jet traffic at altitude moving along J29 high altitude airway over the Memphis area. This object was the probably the size of the Superdome or bigger viewing it from that distance.  The object was not trailing debris, and was maintaining level flight (not following the curvature of the earth) through out the sighting. The light was incredibly bright and did not dim as its azmith turned in passing. I have seen many satillites reflecting sunlight and this was much bigger and brighter than anything man made.

Two white lights seen in Memphis,TN. one on cellphone camera airplanes avoided the aircrafts;2008-11-21 17:00:00;17:-19:45;Two white lights seen in Memphis,TN. one on cellphone camera airplanes avoided the aircrafts There were 2 lights diagonal from each other.I could see airplanes flying around them to avoid these aircrafts. The on to the right was larger and at about 19:30 it disappeared. The smaller one just remained there .Each had white lights and seemed to be a circle shape.The one to the diagonal left was smaller and the other seemed to be much larger.Each moved slightly side to side swiftly. Oh I did call my local Fox network and they put me on hold for nearly 10 min. and I called back and he seemed to think of me as a joke,but he did say they would check it out and they never showed.;35.1263388946818;-89.9382290928053

3 triangular lights on 4 sets of objects, 2 sets of 3 then 2 set of 2 and 1 final one, soundless.;2014-07-08 19:30:00;~3 minutes;3 triangular lights on 4 sets of objects, 2 sets of 3 then 2 set of 2 and 1 final one, soundless. Leaving my front door, there were bright lights in the air above me.  There were 3 lights in a triangular and 2 sets of 3, then 1 set of 2, finally 1 set alone.  Totally silent, moved at the same slow speed.  As they left my left field of vision, they just disappeared.  The silence was as unusual as the lights.  I used the car alarm, the horn screamed and yelled, but no one heard me.  I had nothing to photograph them.   I did call the police and a TV station, just to report if someone else, somewhere else, saw them. ((NUFORC Note:  The witness provided the time and date of the sighting during a follow-up telephone conversation.  PD));35.1263388946818;-89.9382290928053
Round glowing bulbs dims gets supper bright disappears leaving one. Them come the jets circling th bulb really scared us.;2017-04-05 23:00:00;Until passing Arkansas st;Round glowing bulbs dims gets supper bright disappears leaving one.  Them come the jets circling th bulb really scared us Me and my mother are driving through Memphis on our way to Arkansas and we see three glowing round objects.  We turn away to look at the road look back up now there is three which proceed to do circle/zig zags around each other.   Then a third comes as a pulsating light between them disappears then reappears a little farther away with seconds.   Then two disapear leaving the one original one that is glowing bright.  We see small jet looking planes one flying directly above the other going straight toward it.   The bulb dims down so much you can barely see it as more little jets fly toward it from the opposite direction then more jets come maybe between 3-6 at a time some what circling the same spot where the light is the light kept getting really bright then dimming slowly.  I'm not sure what exactly is going on but the other planes seen it two.   I'm hoping we aren't the only people reporting this honestly really scared us.;35.1263388946818;-89.9382290928053
