Object traveled across sky at high speed into a small cloud and did not emerge.;1999-05-13 16:30:00;4 -5 seconds;Object traveled across sky at high speed into a small cloud and did not emerge. While standing outdoors in the apartment's parking area, I observed an object low in the sky moving at high speed, about the speed of a jet aircraft at cruising speed.  The object was white and was of a spherical shape. The outline of the object was distinct there was no evidence of ionization around it, and no vapor trail or tail followed it. The object followed a straight path in the lower sky, approximately SW to NE.  Without slowing down it traveled into a small puffy cloud and did not emerge from the other side of the cloud. No other aircraft were present in the sky at that time, and the object made no sound audible at ground level. There were only a few other clouds in the northern sky at that time, and blue sky was visible all around that cloud.  The wind at that time was prevailing west at 10-15 mph. I observed the cloud into which the object had disappeared until the wind carried the cloud out of my field of view. I am a male, age 44, in good health, with 20-20 vision.  I have worked in the computer-electronics industry for about 20 years and am currently self employed in a home based mail order business.;35.1263388946818;-89.9382290928053

There is a little haze out tonight but as soon as the haze move the light becomes as bright as the moon.  If you stick your arm out at sholders legnth and with a closed fist, make a thumbs-up hand sighn, while rotating your arm and fist into the southwest region of the sky, the light (star or whatever) will be directly on the top of your thumb.  It is so unusual for a star to be seen so so low on the horizon something like at a 5 degree angle off the ground and to be so bright even with the moon out in the south region of the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  We are aware of the fact that Sirius, the fourth brightest objects seen in the Northern Hemisphere, is visible in the north-northeastern sky, about 10 degrees above the horizontal plane at this time of night.  We suspect that the witness describes a celestial body, but we do not know which one it may be.  PD));35.1263388946818;-89.9382290928053
I saw a bright orange sphere that hung in the sky for nearly 10 minutes!;2008-01-20 00:15:00;10 minutes;I saw a bright orange sphere that hung in the sky for nearly 10 minutes! I was outside walking my dog when I looked into the northern sky and saw a bright orange light approaching extremely slow.  It was a sphere shape and would have been about as big as one of those lamps on top of a tower.  As it got closer it was obvious that it was some kind of air craft, not a meteorite or any sort of space debris just by the shear fact that it was moving so slow.  The object was high in the sky and didn't make a noise as it passed over.  I know it couldn't have been a plane, because any planes that come into this area of Memphis are preparing to land at the International Airport and would be much lower.  The orange light that the craft emitted was bright like fire, but constant like a light bulb.  The craft took nearly 10 minutes to cross the sky, as I had time to call two of my friends while I was watching it!  This was the most eerie, awesome thing I've ever seen.

An orange sphere was seen moving quickly across the sky over Memphis.;2019-03-21 22:28:00;20 seconds;An orange sphere was seen moving quickly across the sky over Memphis. I was walking my dogs behind my house, as I do every night, and noticed an orange sphere moving very quickly across the sky in the south-southwest direction.  It appeared to be very high in the sky.  It did not have any of the characteristics of the aircraft that Memphis sees in its skies coming and going to MEMH. Firstly, it did not have flashing lights.  When the planes are headed directly towards your line of sight, you cannot see flashing lights, but they tend to appear yellowish-white this craft was a solid, orange ball.   Secondly, it was going way too fast relative to its  apparent altitude.  Had it been a plane at that altitude, it would have been moving much slower across the sky.  Thirdly, when it finally dawned on me that what I was looking at might actually be a UFO, and I reached into my pocket to take out my phone, it instantly disappeared as if you had just flipped a switch.  It was completely gone.  Since there were no clouds in the sky during this observation, it couldnâ€™t have gone behind a cloud.  The entire observation lasted only 10-12 seconds. For years I have made a minor hobby out of watching the FedEx planes coming and going in the Memphis skies, and I am completely certain that what I saw tonight, March 21, 2019, was not a plane or a helicopter.;35.1263388946818;-89.9382290928053
