They were a dark silver with about 3 or 4 lights each.They were flying at what appeared to be about 30 mph.There were about  4 or 5 of them;35.1263388946818;-89.9382290928053
Between 4-6 dim, orange lights, traveling NNW-SSE. Straight line travel, no noise.;1998-05-04 00:45:00;1 minute;Between 4-6 dim, orange lights, traveling NNW-SSE. Straight line travel, no noise. Objects first seen between Ursa Major and Ursa Minor, near the Draco constellation. Lights passed directly overhead, no noise. Lights were dim orange, similar to an automobile cigarette lighter's color. Pattern was first a triangle, then they changed positions, and one went about 1/2 degree away from the others, then rejoined. Lights faded from view, towards Scorpio, didn't just wink out. Initial impression was that the lights were fixed to a larger, dark object, and that the lights were being strobed to create impression of moving out of position. Only one observer, visual by eye, no binoculars or telescope. No pictures or video. The sky was clear. I am an amatuer astronomer and familiar with the sky, and my viewing area. I have been in the USAF, and the USN. I am as familiar as most with terrestrial aircraft, and this did not match anything I know of. I've never reported anything like this before.;35.1263388946818;-89.9382290928053
Possible sighting associated with a strong storm;2003-07-23 06:30:00;Unknown;Possible sighting associated with a strong storm Beginning at approximately 6:30 a.m. on Monday, July 23, Memphis, Tennessee, and its surrounding areas were hit with a storm which packed winds estimated to be in excess of 100 mph. As you can imagine, the damage done to the city was severe and extensive. At this writing, over a quarter-million homes and businesses are still without power, and there is much wreckage and many damaged buildings throught the city.  When our power went out, I switched on our battery-operated radio and listened to one of the few stations on the air, a sports-talk call-in show. Of course, no one was talking about sports. People were calling in to tell which streets and highways were blocked by debris, etc.  I listened for a while then became preoccupied with completing my morning routine without benefit of electricity when I became aware of a caller who was reporting something strange, that he'd seen. The caller sounded like a mature man, with a rural accent. He seemed very concerned that no one would believe him. The only description that I caught was that he had spotted one of them circle-crop things up in the air,  and he never believed in them before, but he swore he saw it, etc. He sounded completely sincere, and I must add, he was met with a stoney silence by the show's host, who offered no comment at all. The host and co-host merely chuckled and went on to the next caller.  I'm reporting this for a couple of reasons. First of all, Peter has mentioned that sightings are often associated with storms. Secondly, I wonder if anyone else heard this man's report and could offer more details about what the man said. (It may seem absurd to refer to a UFO as a circle-crop thing, but he sounded excited and perhaps even a bit upset by what he'd seen.)  If anyone else heard the report or saw something UFO-related before, during, or after the Memphis storm, I hope they will report it on this site.  Thank you very much for the good work you do.;35.1263388946818;-89.9382290928053
Hovering craft over Memphis, TN.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probable sighting of a celestial body, we suspect.  PD));2005-10-28 05:00:00;1 hour;Hovering craft over Memphis, TN Driving from north Mississippi to Memphis TN is a short trip in I-55.   However, I've been noticing when I wake up early to go to work between 4-5am and as I'm driving north...I look out west or north west there is this....thing about a few thousand yards...not sure of the distance that just hovers there...doesn't move.  It has two strobe lights on the bottom as if to mimick a plane...but the tickler is it doesn't move!  I've seen this for consecutive mornings over and over....and then the other day I saw it again.  This time as it hovered, there was a burst of a light on top ...maybe on top of the aircraft...and it looked like the light was going around...as if it was on a tube or a cylinder. I tell you.....its spooooky.  One of these days I will take my digital camera out there and see if I can't take a picture of it and have it sent in.  I know there has got to be more witnesses....with all these drivers on the highway.   However, the craft is pretty clever to show at dark....and looks to be mimicking aircraft lights.  But if you just watched it for a few minutes...you will realize it just doesn't move...its as if it stopped but still hovering over the city....watching and looking for something. If other Mississippi or Memphis residents see this post....see for yourself!!!!!!!! Bring a camera!!!!!! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Four bright orange lights in a perfect square that was slowly drifting before separating and disappearing.;2007-12-24 20:30:00;10 seconds;Four bright orange lights in a perfect square that was slowly drifting before separating and disappearing. My family and I were finishing Christmas Eve dinner when my aunt went to the car, ran back in, and said we had to come see something. In the sky were four bright orange lights, slightly larger than airplane lights or stars- the largest lights in the sky but very high up.  The odd thing was that they created a perfect square that was drifting slowly through the air.  We assumed they were part of one craft until they all began to drift off in other directions and quickly faded out.  The fact that they kept the square formation so perfectly was what got everyone.  Some neighbors down the street were watching, but we didn't ask them about it.;35.1263388946818;-89.9382290928053

It seemed to;2013-12-16 14:30:00;6 minutes;As I I stood outside on the telephone, I noticed something in the sky which at first seemed to look like a flock of birds.  It seemed to be in the form of migrating birds sort of a V shaped formation, the object was moving very slowly.  As the object moved closer I began to notice that it was not birds, but just a set of lights.  I stood there maybe about 2 minutes and watched the object go from a V shaped formation into a straight line.  I thought maybe I'm just seeing things so I ran into the house and had my sister come out just to make sure I was not hallucinating.  I asked my sister was she seeing this, he then asked me what was it? We could see directly through the object and there was nothing there but lights, no strings, no metal, or anything holding these lights in place.  The object then changed from a line into an oval shape and then back into a line. We stood there maybe 3 minutes the item went about 3 to 4 houses down from the house where I stood over the trees and then vanished into thin air.;35.1263388946818;-89.9382290928053
Yellowish/Orangish oval shaped object flying northbound.;2014-08-17 00:30:00;5-8 minutes;Yellowish/Orangish oval shaped object flying northbound I was sitting in my backyard when I looked up in the sky and saw what looked like a street lamp flying in the sky.  It was the color (yellowish/Orange) and the shape (ovalish/circlish) flying northbound. The light was zig zagging and also moving straight up/down and left/right.  I had never seen anything like this before and it gave me the chills. I ran inside and yelled for my brother to run outside.  We ran to the front yard/street where there were no visual obstructions. He witnessed the same thing I had.  While the object was travelling north,  The oval/circle shaped light dimmed at one point to somewhat of a dot like it would have if it were really far away, however it was in the same general area and then the light went back to normal.  Eventually the object still zigzagging, moving up/down and left/right travelled so far that I couldnâ€™t see it anymore.;35.1263388946818;-89.9382290928053
Bright colors of various intensities lighting up low level clouds and mists for nearly an hour.  ((anonymous report));2017-12-22 23:00:00;45 minutes;Bright colors of various intensities lighting up low level clouds and mists for nearly an hour. At about 11pm local time, looking toward the east, I and several others noticed the sky lighting up.  My first thought was that it was something akin to heat lightning, but it changed color from blue to orange to red to purple to green to white and it continued to light up the sky at random intervals for varied lengths of time while the entire phenomenon went on for nearly an hour.  It was a lightly stormy night with periodic heavy misting in the air so visibility was compromised.   All of us there tried explaining it away as lightning or a transformer shorting out or the like but all were forced to agree that none of our explanations fit.  The intensity of the lights was enough to light up between a quarter and half the sky.  At times it seemed there was a source low to the ground and other times it seemed high up in the sky, just judging by the relative brightness of the mists and clouds being lit and in which direction the brightness intensified.  The range and i! ntensity of colors, duration of the event, and overall unusual behavior and patterns suggested an event outside all of our experiences. It may well have been a weather event, I don't know, but if so it was one I've never experienced or had described to me by any person or textbook.

5-6 yellowish lights moving slowly, yet not audible;2019-01-08 20:00:00;Probably around 10 second;5-6 yellowish lights moving slowly, yet not audible I was taking my dog outside earlier, when I saw around 5-6 lights in a horizontal line, the object looked like it would be a stereotypical ufo.  I didn't have my glasses on so I couldn't see it well, but the object appeared to be in an audible distance from where I was, yet there was no sound from it.  The craft was rather large, I would probably say around the size of a house.  The craft moved in a fixed speed moving slowly right to left.  When I ran I side to get my glasses, which probably took around 20-30 seconds, and returned the the object was gone. Afterwards I noticed that my wifi connection wasn't working properly.  I've seen another UFO before, that was similar to this, but I was in s different state st that time.  I didn't have my phone on me when I took my dog out, so i wasn't able to get a picture or video.;35.1263388946818;-89.9382290928053
UFO heading east over sighted over Memphis.  ((anonymous report));2019-08-16 21:00:00;30 seconds;UFO heading east over sighted over Memphis. Slower than a meteor, faster than Airplane, heading east to northeast.  Swerve pattern across the sky, not regular, so, pilot, but too fast for human craft with light.   We have observed meteors, satellite, planets, and airplanes.  This was different.  . Cool, but a bit scary. Does anyone know of a possible explanation?  If not, please log it. Thx ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));35.1263388946818;-89.9382290928053
