As I look up, there was a really bright star and I see something move from it.  I am watching, then I see another.  At the fourth one I call for my oldest son to come outside.  I asked him to look up. As he is watching he says oh my gosh mom what is that?  We watched what looked like dimmer stars move in formation north to south, bank left and head toward the moon.  After 20 to 30 we of course intrigued looked toward the moon and see several doing their own thing.  Almost playing?  Darting close.  There was no sound.  Then it was over about 2 hours later.  For the ones that broke from formation.  The ones that headed towards the moon seemed to vanish?  I can't explain it other than what looked like tiny dimmer stars.  I do not believe this to be part of Space X. Not after seeing them break from a formation.  And to come from a star? Something brigh! ter than a normal star?  I tried to video and the lights were just to dim and it was dark.  I am sorry.;35.0644;-89.6759000000001
