Driving home on I- 269 east of the city of Colliervile, Tn, I saw in the distance several brilliant white lights that seemed to flash on and off.  I started watching closer and noticed there were two cigar shaped objects the lights were coming from.   There were five lights on each object in a horizontal row.  These objects moved independently of each other and seemed to be hovering below the cloud layer.  When I rounded the curve there were some trees that blocked my view.  After the trees, I looked and the two objects had disappeared.;35.0644;-89.6759000000001
