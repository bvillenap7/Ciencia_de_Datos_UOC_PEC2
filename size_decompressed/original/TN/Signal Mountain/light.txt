It was 12:37 (midnight)I came out side and my step father was smoking a cigarette on the  back porch when he noticed a particular light flickering many different colors which were colors of the following: Neon Red,Neon Green,  A very distinctive white light in the middle they were all pulsating at numerous speeds it varied per light color and thats when I called my best friend to come be a witness to this UFO he was shocked at what it was he drove his car all the way to my back yard which is at least a acre of land I hypothesize that the object was at least at 17,00ft in altitude level after about 45 minutes of watching the craft thats when my step father went back inside to go to bed me and my friend noticed 2 airplanes or possible jets flying towards the object and circling it numerous amounts of time then all of the objects gradually went away but I did not witness them nor did my friend we gave up and went along with our business and left the area ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Small bright green light fell from the sky north of Chattanooga, TN.;2015-11-22 18:02:00;1 second;Small bright green light fell from the sky north of Chattanooga, TN. A single green light seemed to fall straight down from the sky, north of Signal Mtn, Tn (which is just NW of Chattanooga).  It seemed to be propelled by gravity only, but I can’t know for sure.  I cannot judge how far away it was, only that it was more than 200’ because it fell behind leafless trees that were at least 200’ away.  From where I was, the object was the size of a pencil lead – small but very bright.  My companion in the car saw it also and agreed it was green and falling.;35.1494;-85.3384000000001

The altitude, I would have to guess around 15000 feet, about the same for planes 30 miles out out so for take off or landing.  The interesting part the orb shaped light was about 10 times brighter than the brightest star in the sky and was probably   5 times larger than any plane at that altitude. It looked like it was traveling maybe 20 times faster than a plane would cover in the same distance between the tree lines that I viewed the object.  There was no trail, smoke or red or green lights  and made no sound, so it was not a plane or comet.;35.1494;-85.3384000000001
