It was small and was descending. It was lighted all over. It looked to be about 500 feet off the ground and about 2 feet square with one edge, the front edge, tapered. It shot across a clear sky at a very, very fast speed then maneuvered as if to dodge something, like a Bat would do, then the whole thing tilted back and forth very quickly 3 or 4 times. All most like it had lost control then It just disappeared. This entire episode lasted no long than 5 seconds.;36.3401278260869;-86.7194895652174
