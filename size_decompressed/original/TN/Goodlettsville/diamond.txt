I live on a hill in goodlettsville, TN, with a large picture window facing north. While watching TV, I often watch airplanes coming into the Nashville airport. On the evening of the sighting there were high broken clouds. It was not dark yet and the stars were not visible as yet. Suddenly a stationery very bright twinkling light appeared approximately 20 degrees above the horizon with clouds in the background. The light was visible for about 10 seconds then shot to the right at the blink of an eye and disappeared. When the light appeared it was approximately 20 degrees to the right of the usual airport flight path for planes coming in from the north. Air traffic that evening was very light and only a helicopter was noted flying from southwest to northeast about five minutes after the sighting.;36.3401278260869;-86.7194895652174
Large bright light moving slowly to the southwest west;2011-10-28 04:36:00;3 minutes;Large bright light moving slowly to the southwest west At 4:36 A.M. on October 28, 2011, I observed a large bright light approximately 10 degrees to the northeast and approximately 15 degrees above the horizon.  The bright object was moving slowly toward the southwest. My observation was from the front picture window of my house up on a hill. The object was under a solid cloud cover. At first I thought the object was airplane landing lights, but out of the usual flight path.  As it got closer and larger I turned around to a nearby table to get some small binoculars out of the drawer, but when I turned back around the object had disappeared.  The object was visible and caught my eye when I first came into the room.  I observed it for a couple of minutes before reaching for the binoculars. After the object disapeared, I observed the sky for another few minutes to make sure it was not an aircraft. During my observation, there were no other aircraft in my field of vision, which from northern Tennessee to southern Kentucky is unlimited.;36.3401278260869;-86.7194895652174
