It was about 4 am.  I was not feeling well and woke up to get a drink of water.  I looked up and could not believe my eyes.  There was a very large, round shaped, glowing fireball. It seemed to be the same size of the house it was hovering over. I live in a rural area that is usually very dark at night and the home that this object was directly over was all lit up. I got scared so I went to my back door and peeked out the blinds.  The fireball then shrunk to the size and color of a star.  It hovered, then moved extremly fast for a short distance and stopped, then the object vanished.  I woke my husband and told him about it. He could see that I was very upset.  I have never reported this because I didn't want anyone to think I was crazy.  I know what I saw.  This is not something that is easy to forget!;36.3401278260869;-86.7194895652174
