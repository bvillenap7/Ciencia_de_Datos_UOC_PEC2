There was not a cloud to be seen at that time. They were a little large than our largest planet. I thought it was strange they were so close together. All at once, one sped away at a very fast speed horizontally from the other. The other one just stayed there in it's place, not moving at all. As I drove from the bank I watched the one object that was there until the trees, of course, hid it and I could no longer see it.;36.3401278260869;-86.7194895652174
2 circles shapes moving across the sky , was not a bird or a plane;2009-05-25 21:30:00;20 sec;2 circles shapes moving across the sky , was not a bird or a plane It was on May 25,2009 around 9:30 pm, I was outside cooking some hamburgers. I was sitting in my rocking chair looking up at the sky, looking at stars and watching planes go by.  Then from the south comes these 2 dots,( they look like when you take a flash light and shine it into some smoke in a far off distance you have the round shape of a light)it had no blinking lights too it at all.  The came from the south and headed north.. The first one was moving in a straight line and the one behind it look like it was struggling too keep up with it and was moving around behind it.  Then it disappeared. There where no clouds, just a clear night. I know what i saw and it was not no airplanes nor birds.  I know what i saw and i don't want ppl to think i am crazy.;36.3401278260869;-86.7194895652174
