slowly arching light brightens into flame then trails into oblivion;2001-12-20 19:30:00;approx. 10 seconds;slowly arching light brightens into flame then trails into oblivion my wife and i were returning home from an outing.  it was approximately 7:30 p.m.  i had gotten my sleepy daughter from the back, passenger side child seat.  i love to view the night skies.  i was standing in the driveway looking upward, as i usually do when arriving back home at night.  i noticed that from the west, from up over the roof from the back side of our home, a very brilliant fireball/reddish looking light.  i at first thought it may have been a satellite because of the slower-than-a-falling-star motion and the way it arched across the sky.  i commented out loud as to how unusual that was.  (my wife doesn't get into that kind of stuff like i do)  i watched it trail almost directly overhead in an easterly direction then slightly bank.  it still continued in an easterly direction but the color changed to a very brilliant red and seemed to either be on fire or reflecting the sun, considering it's apparent altitude.  i have studied aircraft for years and had even started pilot training several years ago.  (ran out of money)  i would judge the altitude to be something upwards of 50,000 ft.  it initially appeared to be a satellite.  i watched it seem to leave a 'dust' trail as it slowly seemed to burn up.  perhaps it could have been a deliberate attempt to destroy some 'space junk'.  i'm not sure.  i thought that it would be unusual to 'destroy' a satellite in that manner, though probably not completely out of the question.  the entire viewing pleasure lasted approximately 7-15 seconds.  who knows.  perhaps there were more sets of eyes that had the privilege of seeing the abnormality, as well.;36.3401278260869;-86.7194895652174
