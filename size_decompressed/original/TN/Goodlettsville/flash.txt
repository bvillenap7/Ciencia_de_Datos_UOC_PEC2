The first observer, a fifty-year-old male, noticed on his way up the driveway that about forty bright, reddish lights were hovering in the sky.  They resembled the lights of planes except their motions were entirely different and they were spread about in a way that was contrary to the structure of a plane.  The lights moved incredibly slowly and were hovering more than flying or moving. The first observer remained parked at the bottom of the driveway and called the second observer, a seventeen-year-old female, who was inside the house.  She turned off the porch lights and looked outside to see several of the red dots still hovering in the sky. By the time she saw them there were only three left.  As she looked, they grew dimmer and dimmer.  They looked like they were simply fading away instead of moving somewhere else. After the event the second witness discovered that a friend who lives several miles away saw the same thing the friend alleges that he, his cousin, and his father saw 26 bright yellow lights in the sky. The flashes of light in question did not appear to be connected in any way.  They seemed entirely independent of each other, not like lights attached to something larger.  The first witness notes that they covered a large amount of area in the sky and that he initially mistook them for a mass of jets but realized they moved far too slowly.;36.3401278260869;-86.7194895652174
