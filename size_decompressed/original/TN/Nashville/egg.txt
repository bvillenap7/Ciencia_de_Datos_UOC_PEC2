It hovered slowly over downtown area and then moved south east over nashville intl airport.  at the same time I was able to observe airplanes serve their normal routes, coming out of clouds and landing.   This craft was moving at a much slower pace and also took up a much larger portion of the sky.  It eventually disappeared headed south east. ((NUFORC Note:  Date and time have been corrected above.
