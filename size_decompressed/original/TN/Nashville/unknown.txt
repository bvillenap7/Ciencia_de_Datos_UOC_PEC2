unusual overhead occurence while on family walk.;2002-06-09 20:30:00;1-10 minutes;unusual overhead occurence while on family walk. while on a family walk with our two dogs,my family and I walked along a road that is is under one of the approach flight-paths used by nashville int. airport. This road is remarkable for the fact that it is in a neighborhood that was depopulated as the airport grew.The road is closed to thru traffic and blocked, although accessable on foot.It was dark and we carried a flashlight. No one that we knew of was on the road.We were able to see and hear the approach of about three passenger jet planes as we walked. Each plane was clearly visible and fairly well into descent as we saw them. There were distinct intervals of time between each air approach when the windless quiet of the night resumed. In other words the traffic wasnt stacked up. It was during one of these interludes that everyone in the family heard the sound of something up above us.The sound was of something clearly moving thru the air,BUT!!! there were no lights no engine or jet sounds... nothing but this sound. I want to emphasize that there was no natural wind activity in the area. Everyone was perplexed and at a lost for explanation. There were two events of this nature. At the end of this section of road an airport police squad car was parked.We are wondering if anything like this has ever been reported. We are stumped. We know all of the noises and effects associated with planes overhead in this area,as we have walked it before. ((NUFORC RESPONSE TO WITNESS)) Dear Mr. ((name deleted)),  Thank you very much for the report!  Yes, what you report has been reported to us before...I believe you heard the turbulent vortex activity generated by the tip of an airplane wing.   When airliners land, using a relatively high angle of attack on approach, the air on the bottom of the wing leaks around the tip of the wing.  This continuous process generates a tornado at the tip of the wing, which persists in the atmosphere for a long period of time.  The twisting air can be heard at ground level, and it is quite prominent in a calm sky.  That is only a theory, but I suspect that if you return to the same location, you can experience the same effect.  Thank you for sharing the information with our Center!

Blurry blob of light streaking through sky above a cloud;2009-11-20 23:30:00;3-5 seconds;Blurry blob of light streaking through sky above a cloud Last night I was outside at approximately 23:30.  I was on the west side of my house between my house and my neighbor’s house.  I was walking northward towards my back yard.  There were a few low clouds that were mostly transparent.  I saw a streak of light traveling from east to west above one of the clouds.  Because I saw it through the cloud, it was kind of blurry.  It was traveling very fast, and it only lasted a few seconds before it flew out of site behind my neighbor’s house.  My first thought is that it was a meteor.  However, I watched a meteor shower several weeks ago, and this “streak” traveled a longer distance than the meteors I’ve seen.  It was also traveling the opposite direction of the meteors I saw a few weeks ago.  (I admit that I don’t know much about meteors, and I assume they can travel in any direction.)  However, this streak didn’t look as long as the meteors I saw and it lasted longer.  My next thought is that it was a spotlight, but! I searched the horizons, and I didn’t see any spotlights shining up and moving around.  My last explanation was that it could have been some light refracting through the corner of my glasses lenses, and it created some sort of optical illusion.  However, there were no cars driving by or any other moving source of light that could have caused that.  Also, since I’ve worn glasses for years, I can say that I have never experienced an optical illusion of a light in a cloud due to refracted light though my glasses.  It was too fast to be a plane, plus there was no noise.  It was most likely a meteor, but it didn’t look or behave like the meteors I’ve seen.  But I admit that may be because my sight of it was distorted though the low thin cloud.  I would say that the chances of this being some sort of ET craft is very low, but since I couldn’t positively identify it, it was a mystery to me, and therefore, a UFO.  I just wanted to report it so that there would be record of it in c! ase someone else saw something, too.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779
UFO CASEBOOK REPORT:  Alien Encounter in Tennessee;2010-02-15 05:00:00;minutes;Alien Encounter in Tennessee Peter, this is B J Booth, webmaster of UFO Casebook, and guide at about.com UFOs and Alien site.   I am sending this on behalf of a witness, who works for a law firm in Tennessee, and relates an alien encounter.  I am including her contact phone number in the appropiate section. Alien Encounter - Alien Encountered in Cheatham County, TN  I reside in Cheatham County, Tennessee, and observed an alien in my yard in February this year. The reason I am coming forward is because the description the woman in Georgia provided of the 3 alien beings she observed at a campsite where she and her husband were camping the latter part of 2009 is almost exactly the same as what I saw. It was approximately 5:00 in the morning.  There was still snow on the ground from the last snow.  I had gotten ready for work and was sitting in my Suzuki in the drive letting it warm up before leaving for my job in Nashville, Tennessee. I caught movement out of the corner of my eye in the area of my garage (which is used for storage and not to pull a car into).  At first, I thought it was one of the neighbor's dogs. I turned to look and saw something which very closely matched the description of the alien creatures which the woman in Georgia observed. Its body, extra long arms and hind legs were so thin.  Its head was very large and bumpy. It was pale in color and hairless. It was very cold outside, and the creature appeared a light grayish color (I'm not sure whether the cold temperature would have affected the appearance of the color). The only difference in my story and hers is that the 3 creatures she saw were upright.  This was moving on all 4's, however, the way it was moving made it appear like a monkey or gorilla that are oftentimes upright, but then use their arms in conjunction with their legs to propel themselves forward. On all 4's, it was about the height of a large dog, and I observed that it would be considered short, compared to most humans, if it stood upright. Its legs were short, quite a bit stockier than the body and arms, which were long and skinny. It kept looking back as though it thought it was being followed, and so it was surprised to see me sitting inside the automobile when it looked around, directly at me, for the first time. I got a good look at its large, round eyes which were darkish in color.  They appeared a dark brown.  It was as though it sensed I wasn't going to hurt it, and it continued on across my yard, across the road, and continued out a connecting road which is directly in front of my home. There are lots of wooded areas in the direction it was traveling, and lots of wooded area behind my home. I am not comfortable just ignoring this occurrence. Questions are racing through my mind - questions which need to be answered. What are these creatures doing in our wooded areas, hiding out by day and wandering by night?  Where did they come from?  Are they depleting any of our resources?  Will they become dangerous if someone acts aggressively toward them?  (I was so busy looking at its eyes and bumpy head that I cannot describe a nose and/or mouth.)  I am a sane individual who is employed at one of Nashville's most prominent law firms.

The Object proceeded over our location in response to an interactive action.;2010-09-02 05:00:00;1 min.;The Object proceeded over our location in response to an interactive action. I am forever amazed at the number of so-called experts in this field of study… who profess to know what is authentic evidence... and what is not.  I am appalled at the censorship of reports that MUFON receives. If it doesn’t fit their criteria of benefit, they move it to a hidden file. I know… I was a MUFON Investigator! You guys can’t seem to get past the limitations of digital technology to analyze what is real… and what you state is not.  Since most experts who sell books and lectures have very little experience, regarding the information that they weave into their sales and lectures, than maybe the chase of this anomaly will gather no real and substantial foundation other than the sensationalist venue where it has thus been historically  limited.  I suppose… that is good for cover-up and book sales.  But for the eye witness, you know in your gut… that which is real. You need not rely upon people, or experts, or anyone else to validate your experience. Let he who has eyes, let him see!   ((name deleted)), F.I. Nashville, TN;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779
Two lights flying in random patterns over Nashville.;2012-10-19 23:45:00;>20 minutes;Two lights flying in random patterns over Nashville. Two lights appearing above clouds.  Moving in random rapid patterns.  Sometimes both appearing to fly together, then one would stop and very quickly shoot off in the opposite direction.  I observed for 20 minutes.  These were in the distance to the southwest.   My son spotted them coming homr from work and called me.  He said they appeared closest to him when he was near Harding Place an I-65. I thought they might have been spotlights, but the lights were coming from above not below.  Not only was the pattern random, so was the speed, but generally they moved much faster than an airplane.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779
4 objects not visible to the naked eye, flying around odd vertical rainbow.;2012-10-30 17:00:00;several minutes;4 objects not visible to the naked eye, flying around odd vertical  rainbow. Driving home at 5pm headed towards the city from Elm Hill and 40-W I saw a small vertical rainbow in the sky.  I pulled over to take a few pictures, since the vertical sliver of rainbow was something I had never seen.  When looking at the camera screen I noticed 4 objects flying around the&quot rainbow&quot. I looked without using the camera and could not see the objects with the naked eye.  I once again looked at the screen and the objects were still moving around the rainbow.  I did this several times with the same result. I cleaned my lens, as well as checked my camera by taking photos of other things in the area.  This was not a dirty lens.  The objects could be disc shaped but it is hard to tell.  I have a series of photos.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779
Metallic shapes circling overhead, then flying off to the northeast.;2015-02-03 16:30:00;5-10 minutes;Metallic shapes circling overhead, then flying off to the northeast. While I was in my backyard, I noticed a leaking gutter.   When I looked up, I noticed a small metallic shape in the sky.  I, at first, thought it was a high flying plane, but then I saw it was traveling in a very tight clockwise circle.   Then I realized there was another flying in a counterclockwise circle next to it.  The flight paths never intersected but passed extremely close to one another.   I could not make out the exact shape of them because they were so high.  They did seem to be metallic.   Also, there were no flapping movements like birds.  If they were birds they would naturally fly with each other not in opposing circles.   After I observed this for about 5-10 minutes, one of them flew off to the north-east.   Soon afterwards the second one followed.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779

They were semi-stationary in sky near the edge of low dark storm clouds on the horizon.   Approximately 4 miles away.  They appeared and reappeared slowly.  No aircraft lights visible.

I watched a couple planes fly over where you could tell that these lights were significantly higher then normal plane height.  They just seemed to be darting from side to side then the lights were just gone.  You could visually see the lights move where it wasn’t just normal stars flashing.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779

About a qtr mile from the whites creek pike exit I noticed 3 or 4 solid green lights and a blinking red light Southwest if Briley hanging  at a low altitude.  At first I thought maybe it was a large radio tower that I’d never noticed before, but I was confused by that idea due to the distance between the lights.  As I took the Whites Creek Pike exit I realized that the lights were moving northward in unison.  Once I stopped at end of the exit I was able to stare at the object for maybe 10 seconds before it was nearly out of sight over the tree line.  I only thought to record at the last second.  I have a few seconds of footage to share if anyone is interested.  After reviewing the video the craft appears to be triangle shaped with the blinking  red light at the rear.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779
Space Station like object no sound;2021-06-03 19:15:00;5 minutes;Space Station like object no sound As I was pulling in my driveway from returning from the store, I looked up in the sky and saw a metallic item kind a shaped like a plane but it didn't really look like one. It almost reminded me of the Space Station but it wouldn't be in that low of an orbit. It came over my house slowly without any sound at all the sun was reflecting off the bottom and it's one reason why couldn't really tell what it looked like.  I live near the airport in Nashville and planes go over and near my house all the time.  This didn't look like a normal airplane. It didn't make a sound at all. As I said they way it went over my house reminded me of the space station but it went over slower than it does.  I watch the space station go over my house all time as I have the app on my phone.  As I said it went slowly across the sky and all of the sudden it disappeared.  As if it had hit the horizon.  My husband was standing in the doorway of our front door and asked me what I was looking at and I told him, he was quite skeptical of what I said I was seeing. Jokingly said it was a UFO which I truly think it was.  I didn't get any photos as I was stunned and I was entering my driveway returning from the store, just happened to look up in the sky for some reason.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779
2 objects near Nashville airport.;2021-09-02 20:00:00;5 minutes;2 objects near Nashville airport.  I was down Murfreesboro Rd going under the runway by airport.  When i came out from under it I seen 2 bright lights with some dimmer lights above it.  They were really low in the sky.  It was 2 of them because they were moving in different directions. It looked almost like parachutes because of the way but it was dark so I couldnt see anything else.  As i watched them move away from the airport headed east one got dimmer.  I lost them in a back road but when i turned onto smith springs rd i seen them again. They were higher in the sky.  Then i seen one of them just shoot off going Very very fast in the sky.  I lost the other one.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779
