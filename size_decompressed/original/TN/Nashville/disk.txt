Nashville, TN near airport;2002-03-19 14:00:00;seconds;Nashville, TN near airport Going to lunch, near the Nashville airport I saw a cylinder very briefly, I turned back around and saw a blur, then it was gone.  I didn't think too much of it, but there seems to have been many sightings on this day in Tennessee, so now I have to think it might have been something.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779

Circle shaped solid white object flying through clouds.;2006-10-11 01:25:00;13 sec;Circle shaped solid white object flying through clouds. I was talking to a friend online and I was about to sign off yahoo. I looked out my window because it's a cloudy day with the rain we had during the night and early morning. I saw a solid white unknown air craft flying at a high rate of speed at a very high altitude. It did not have any reflection like a commercial airliner does, and neither the shape. It was like a circle shape but had more of an edge toward the front.  This object did put out a stream behind it but the stream went away just as fast as it came out. And the object appeared to be climbing higher in altitude. I watched it fly through the clouds until I could see it no more.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779

Very bright, disk shaped UFO moved very rapidly above Briley Parkway in Nashville.;2013-09-29 17:45:00;one minute;Very bright, disk shaped UFO moved very rapidly above Briley Parkway in Nashville. I was driving East on Briley Parkway in Nashville TN today, about one quarter mile away from exit 11. Suddenly, a disk shaped UFO appeared in the sky. The UFO was a solid white color, that shined very bright in the sky.  The object moved very rapidly to the east.  After the object moved across the sky for around 55 seconds, the speed of the object increased even faster then disappeared after around 5 seconds.  My date witnessed this appearance as well, we both are still amazed.  I'm a Lending Manager/Banker here in Nashville. I have been in this profession for 8 years.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779
2 hovering light disc's during CMA music fest Nashville, TN.;2014-06-07 19:15:00;30-60 seconds;2 hovering light disc's during CMA music fest Nashville TN After carefully watching the skies, due to severe weather in the area at this time, I observed what appeared to be a funnel cloud on my way home.  I took a couple pictures with my cellphone of the funnel cloud.  After driving through the storm and arriving at my home maybe 10 minutes later after taking the photos of the funnel clouds, I looked out my back door at the sky and saw two hovering discs of white yellow light.  They remained stationary and faded into the clouds, after about what seemed to be 30 to 45 seconds.  I live 10 to 15 minutes south of Nashville, TN, and the ufos appeared to me looking north in the direction of downtown Nashville.   This event (the severe weather and sighting) took place during the CMA music festival ... coincidence maybe..maybe not.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779
((HOAX??))  Round, oval-like shape.  ((anonymous report));2017-03-23 00:00:00;9 minutes;Round, oval-like shape. I was in my house, and suddenly I heard a big whoosh/boom.  I looked out the window to see what it was and I saw an oval shaped UFO come from the top of the window to the middle.  It came from the top and made a backwards check mark and sat there.   After about 4/5 minutes another one appeared and did the same thing.  They were both oval shaped and had two yellow lights on the sides and one big if, bright blinking red light on the bottoms.   I went to get my phone but when I came back, they were gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous provides no contact information.
