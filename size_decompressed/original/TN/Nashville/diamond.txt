UFO Spotted on 8/22/2014 Flying Slowly over Sky.;2014-08-22 22:30:00;3 minutes;UFO Spotted on 8/22/2014 Flying Slowly over Sky. I was standing on the front yard of my farm.  Looking up I noticed a pretty big bright light moving slowly from the south to the north.  I know the difference between a plane at night in the sky and a satellite way in the distance and this was neither of those 2 things.  I kept watching to see if I would notice additional blinking lights like on a plane and there were none. the shape seemed to be diamond like and bright like a star.   I ran to grab 2 friends and showed them the very bright flying object which made no noises at all.  We all 3 of us stood there going what the hell is this??  Trying to make sense of it.   Then it just dimmed to orange then disappeared.  It did not get obstructed by anything.  Totally clear night and gone just like that.  It actually dimmed out slowly to orange and then was gone.   I noticed on the news this morning about recent sightings in other states and Nashville too recently.  This was real.  I'm a professional and will be looking up allot more often now.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779
I saw a star like object appear as bright as Venus for about 4-5 seconds and gradually disappear.;2016-09-21 19:40:00;5 seconds;On Wednesday night, September 21, 2016, @ 7:40PMCT, about 40 minutes after sundown, I was viewing the sky from the middle Tennessee area, looking in the far North West of a clear sky and I saw a star like object appear as bright as Venus for about 4 to 5 seconds, and gradually disappear.  The sighting appeared to be stationary, not moving in any direction, simply appeared and disappeared.   I am wondering if this sighting could have been a caused by the reflective surface on a geostationary or communication satellite? ((NUFORC Note:  One of two sighting reports submitted by the same source.

I saw star like object appear and then disappear about 5 times within about a 4-5 minute time bracket.;2016-10-22 20:40:00;4 minutes;I saw star like object appear and then disappear about 5 times within about a 4-5 minute time bracket. On Saturday night, October 22, 2016, @ 8:40PMCT, I was viewing the sky from the middle Tennessee area, looking in the far North West of a clear sky, and I saw a star like object appear, and then disappear, about 5 times within about a 4-5 minute time bracket.   Then looking slightly to the left a little more to the west, I saw another star like object do the very same thing twice.  Both sightings appeared to be stationary, not moving in any direction, simply appearing and disappearing.  Both looked just like a star.   I am wondering if these sightings could have been a caused by the reflective surfaces on geostationary or communications satellites?
