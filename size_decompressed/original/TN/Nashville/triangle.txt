1976  bronze triangle seen in nashville, tn;1976-01-08 20:00:00;seconds;1976  bronze triangle seen in nashville, tn this is a report that my niece made to my family in 1976.  She was walking across the parking lot of an apt house on haywood lane, when she became aware of a large, bronze triangular craft floating right over her head. she said it was completely silent.  she stood in awe watching this thing until it flew past her. she said nothing about lights or any other traits, just that it looked to be bronze and it was a triangle. my niece has a very high-IQ and is not known to report anything like this for any reason other than to report what she has seen.  about 20 years later, i happened by 'coincidence' to find another person in the Briley Pkwy area of Nashville who claimed to have seen the very same thing during the same year.  (I had to approximate the time of sighting) ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779
A large dumbbell shaped ufo appeared, and then it seemed to be engaged (as if in violation of something) by three smaller triangle ufos;1980-06-15 21:42:00;40 minutes;A large dumbbell shaped ufo appeared, and then it seemed to be engaged (as if in violation of something) by three smaller triangle ufos A friend and I were driving home from playing video games one evening.  We were near the intersection of Bell Rd. and Mufreesboro Rd. travelling south, when we noticed a very large object that looked like a giant dumbbell in the sky.  I saw on the dash radio when we got out it was 9:42pm as immediately prior to the beginning of the incident I was changing the radio station.  The object came in very slow from the NE, and then turned paralell to the road we were on.  It came to a stop.  As it came to a stop another vehicle, a station wagon, stopped with us.  Out of it got a man, a woman, a boy, and a oyung girl. We estimated it to be about a half of a mile to a mile away.  It appeared to hover.  There was no sound of any type eminating from it.  About five minutes or so after it stopped in the air, three triangular ships approached it from the NE also at a high rate of speed, and took up positions rotating about it.  This relationship was maintained by all the ships with the three triangular ships were rotating horizontally, with their apparent noses pointing towards the dumbbell shaped craft in a counter clockwise manner.   We maintained this observation for some ten minutes, until the dumbell craft moved SSE about three ship lengths of itself, abruptly turned to a 60 degree upward pitch, and literally went up instantly.  The starfield around the ship seemed to bend towards it.  Almost as quickly, the three triangular ships turned upward, as if in pursuit of it.  They seemed to be reacting to the dumbbell ships actions, and were visibly slower in their acceleration towards it. When we got in the car it was 10:24pm, and we seemed disturbed by the incident because the amount of time we spent outside the vehicle seemed to be no more than 15 to 20 minutes.  Not the slightly over forty.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779
Silent black triangle moving slowly in urban environment;2001-09-11 20:00:00;10 minutes;Silent black triangle moving slowly in urban environment This occurred while I was in college.  While 9/11 was a traumatic event for everybody, I was not personally connected with the tragedy and was not overly emotionally distraught.  I also was not under the influence of any alcohol or drugs. Shortly after nightfall, I was walking to a parking garage at the corner of West End and 21st Avenue.  A large black triangle, no lights, moved from west to east over West End. It was traveling very slowly.  No noise.  It was a cloudy evening with low cloud ceiling, and could not have been more than 2 or 3000 feet in elevation.  The object appeared to be massive, and was pitch black in color and clearly silhouetted against the light glare from the streetlights on the clouds. The sighting was associated with a feeling of dread. I lingered on the street corner for around half an hour after the object had left and did not see any other UFO.  I did not tell anybody at the time because it seemed crazy I remember speculating that it might be defense related given the events of the day.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779

Our background is that we all work in a music studio in Bellevue in Davidson county and we were driving to my house to get some more reel to reel tape for the recording machines at rob's house/studio.

They definitely show what I believe to be some sort of lines with lights, it is only one line but where it would form a V, i have a shot of what looks to be a craft of some sort at the other V point.  It was a cloudy day and nearing sunset when I heard and saw this.  In the third frame, it appears as though multiple crafts were in focus.  I only had a 200 mm lens but as I enlarge the photos, the sighting is remarkable.  I misplaced the film in Florida and I found it in March of this year.

I saw 3 things wednesday.  2ufo's and one strange thing.;2003-09-24 01:53:00;1 min 30 sec.;I saw 3 things wednesday.  2ufo's and one strange thing. I pull security at a parking garage in the the heart of downtown.  I pull watch on 2 connecting garages, both 7 levels high.  I generally have to walk through both levels periodically every hour.  While working I generally like to star watch, so over the 2 mth period that I have been working, I have learned the star patterns for that area.  This particular night wasn't all that different than any other night.  The night was clear and the stars were out.  Because this was on early Wed. morning, downtown was pretty empty.  Let me begin by stating I saw 3 different things that night, also I am a black woman early 30's and in all my life I have never seen anything out of the ordinary.  I am also a gulf war vet, who has pulled a lot of guard duty outside. Let me repeat I have never seen anything out of the ordinary until now!  The 1st sighting wasn't a vehicle, it was a thing.  It was reddish-brown, had a tail,  moved like a jelly-fish to elevate itself higher & higher in the air. After clearing the building it than went sideways to the right and after something shot out at it, it faded away. The 2nd sighting happened 15 mins. later.  The was a triangular shaped vehicle that a light at each point, this one is commonly seen in magazines.  The ship appeared from nowhere stated to take off in mid-air and disappeared again.  By the way there was no sound with any of these events.  I then went down to the first level to take a break.  When I return on one of the rounds, I saw object number 3.  It appeared from nowhere, floated away from me then disappeared.  At first I thought it was a plane, because of the blinking night,  but there was no sound.  As close as it was, if it were a plane it would have made sound.  Then I thought that it might be a blimp.  But there was no larger upper body.  Also, the direction of the way if floated, a plane or a blimp would not have been able to move that way.  I also thought that it could have been a helicopter, but the lights weren't right and like I said, there! was no sound.  Well that's my report. tj.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779
Three black triangle-shaped crafts over highway;2004-08-31 21:16:00;unknown;Three black triangle-shaped crafts over highway My mother and I were leaving from the BP station after fueling. We looked up and saw three black triangle-shaped crafts flying one behind the other over the highway. We were just about to get on Briley Parkway when this sightings was seen at this time. We don't know how long these crafts slowly hovered over the area. However, we saw them with white and red lights at our angle. On their current path they must have been flying from north to south headed towards Nashville. I don't know their final path because we were headed west to pick up my father from work. We couldn't hear anything coming from the crafts as far as any noises.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779
The object was two planes length away from our plane and moved very slowly in front of the plane. It was very flat.;2005-06-15 18:30:00;less then 1 minute;The object was two planes length away from our plane and moved very slowly in front of the plane.  It was very flat. I was on US Airways flight 207 flying from Nashville Metropilitan Airport, TN flying to Charlotte Douglas Airport, NC.  The flight departed Nashville at 6:00pm and was scheduled to land in Charlotte at 8:11pm.  I had a window seat on the left side of the plane.  Around 6:30pm I looked out the window and saw a UFO flying from the front of the plane and slowly passing by.  I could not distinguish the shape, but it appeared to be either triangle or rectangular.  What was really striking was how flat it was and no sign of anything that looked like a cockpit.   The object flew very close, probably two plane length away from the plane. The passenger seated in front of me and I continued to watch the object go by until we could not see it anymore.  When I departed the plane, I asked the pilot what type of plane that passed our plane.  He said what plane?  I said, around 6:30 pm, it passed right in front of our plane.  He said he did not see it and anyway he was sure the tower was had their eye on it.  The conversation was very strange and the pilot was trying to play it down.

Large silent object that landed and seemed to hover and make fast turns!!;2009-01-21 23:00:00;30 minutes;Large silent object that landed and seemed to hover and make fast turns!! My fiancé was driving me home after she had gotten off work when I noticed a large bright object in the sky.  We had just passed smith springs road were it intersects with murfresboro road driving away from downtown Nashville.  I was in the passenger seat and saw it to the left and in front of the car. At first I thought I was looking at a helicopter as the object seemed to hover.  But, as we drove closer I could see that the object was long and flat on the bottom and far to large to be a helicopter. Once we made it to our turn at nashboro blv, we could see the object quite clearly and noticed that it had begun to move slowly.  Once we turned from murfresboro on to nashboro blv., the object passed over our car slowly and making no noise at all.  The object was low enough that if I had been on the roof of a nearby house I could almost have touched it.  After it passed over our car we watched it descend into a near by field. We drove around trying to get a better view of where it had landed but were unable to see more then a bright glow from the road.  Neither of us were willing to get out of the car and trek through unknown fields to find it so we drove around hoping we could get a better view.  After about 10 minutes of driving up both smith springs and nashboro blv we saw the craft shoot back into the sky at a steep angle.  After it took off we followed it until the object turned around and a plane passed over us a few seconds later. We made a u-turn at bell road back onto smith springs to follow both the plane and the object. We lost sight of the plane and never saw it again but we did find the object again flying low and parallel to murfresboro road.  We followed it down murfresboro till it came to a halt in the air and then a few moments later it turned and headed back the other way towards nashboro blv again.  Making another u-turn we followed the object turning off murfresboro and back onto nashboro blv. There it traveled straight down nashboro blv and I snapped a few pictures while driving after it. After about 3 minutes the object turned sharply around an came over our car once again.  It was silent and fast and quickly was out of sight seeming to descend again. After this we lost sight of the object and were unable to find it again.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779
Triangular shaped lights traveling extremely fast seen in binoculars over Nashville TN;2010-11-08 00:30:00;seconds;Triangular shaped lights traveling extremely fast seen in binoculars over Nashville TN Ten years ago I witnessed an object in the sky I could not explain. I sent an email to someone well known for his knowledge in unknown arial phenomena to get his opinion. He stated he did not know what it was that I saw. Regardless of his comment I eventually dismissed my sighting as space debris.  Now 10 years later I revisited my email and realized that my space debris explanation was not sufficient, mainly do to the speed of the object (which from the email apparently concerned me back then as well). For that reason I decided to file this report.  Most of it comes from the email I sent 10 years ago. I did however add to the report from current memory where the information was lacking from the email. Therefore most of the report was recorded the day after the sighting.  Here is my report.  I arrived home from work to my home in the suburbs of Nashville, TN last night at about 12:20 AM CST  Nov 8th, 2010. I decided to take my 20x80 astronomical binoculars out to look at Jupiter. I had seen a bright star which I mistaken for the planet. The star turned out to be Sirius.  Since I had the binoculars out I decided to look at the stars. I focused on a patch of stars directly over head at the zenith and suddenly something came into my field of view and very quickly exited. It traveled through the center of my view and not kidding it traveled from one side of my field of view to the other in 1/5th to 1/10th of a second. The timeframe stated is not arbitrary. I spent about 10 minutes recapping the event from memory trying to determine the amount of time it took to traverse my field of view. The object was headed directly southeast. It traveled so fast that I could hardly make out the form of the object. What I saw were three well defined white lights in an equilateral triangle headed point end first. There was absolutely no sound in the sky, no sound of a jet engine.  Using astronomy software called Stellarium I was able to estimate that the object was about 7 to 10 arcminutes in size however, this estimate was made from my current memory and not made 10 years ago.  My first thought after witnessing the object was that I had seen a satellite. It wasn’t until maybe 20 minutes later that it occurred to me that satellites don’t appear as triangles.  The next day (Nov 9th 2010) I went outside to compare what I saw to high flying airliners. I witnessed one airliner at about the same location and it traversed my field of view in 4 seconds. What I saw was traveling across the sky much faster.  Binoculars I used were Cabela’s 20x80, field of view is 2.7 degrees, 141 ft at 1000 yds.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779

I thought how strange that planes would fly so close to each other.   Then I noticed each craft had 2 red lights (not blinking) and 1 Orange/yellow light (not blinking) that's what made me more curious.   As I watched the 3 crafts headed north in the eastern sky they slowed down then hovered.   I noticed that a aircraft at this point turned and went into their direction and at that point its as if they just disappeared.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779

It was in the shape of a huge triangle.  It was one dark solid object and, If I had to guess, I'd say there were 5 to 6 round shaped lights on each side.  The lights were a yellowish/orange color, kinda the same as streetlights.  The lights didn't blink at all (like you would expect to see on airplane's).  Either it was military or something local/something to do with Christmas...? Idk (I doubt).  It was flying in the northwest direction. This object made no noise whatsoever.  If you wasn't looking up at exactly the right time, you most likely wouldn't have seen it. I was just wondering if anyone in middle Tennessee area had seen the same thing?  Or anyone at all in the southeast?  Just curious!  If so, I would like to be contacted via e-mail if possible.  Thanks.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779

They were about the size of half-dollars in the sky and spread apart about a foot from each other as you look up.  Whatever it was, it was very close and NOT the moon or planes.
