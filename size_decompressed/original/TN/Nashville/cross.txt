At around 4 pm while driving along the Percy Preist Dam, all the way to Veret Park. Very high, about 20,000 ft. Was white and moved slowly in defferent directions or either stationary. Possisbly space station skylab or space shuttle, however changed directions???? Very weird. Seemed to vanish several times. Also appeared to be larger and have sparkles of light when last observed. There was NO contrail. If anyone Knows where the space shuttle or space station was that day please contact me.  I DOUBT that it was either one though.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779
