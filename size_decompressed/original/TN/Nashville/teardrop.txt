Me and my mother were driving to a mall one day, when I spotted a tear-shaped ufo. It looked like a cross between white and grey, like the color of an airplane. At first I thought it was an airplane, but then a little puff of air came out of the back, and it shot forward. It was still in view, because I saw it over a wide open airport take-off place, and I continued to watch it, then my mother saw it. It seemed to turn around, then a little puff came out the back again, and it shot forward. It hovered in one spot for a long time, then floated out of view.

Nothing like I have ever seen before.;2008-10-22 03:00:00;5 secs;Nothing like I have ever seen before The sighting was very brief.  I have lived in the mountains my whole life and I know what a shooting star is and this was no a star.  I was in the city not more than a mile from where I live.  You really can't even see the stars from where I was.  We walked out of the bar where we had had a few drinks.  I looked up and saw a large light moving across the sky.  This was no star!!!!!  I guess if you want the color it was white.  WHY IN THE HELL DO YOU WANT THE BACK GROUNDS OF THE OBSERVER!!!!!!!  Either you saw it or you didn't.  Believe me I feel like an ass even writing this.   All I know is there was something in the sky that I have never seen in my life!!;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779
