This area ;1999-05-18 22:50:00;2 minutes;Iwas driving south from Nashville on Nolensville Rd at 9:30 p.m. Lights to my right (west) just off the road caught my eye.  This area on the southern Davidson/northern Williamson county line is rather rural.  My first thought was that two light planes were about to collide.  They were close and very low to the ground.  Suddenly I realized that what I was seeing was two boomerang crafts nested one behind the other only about two hundred feet off the ground.  They were perfectly still.  There was a small pinpoint light on the wing tip of each craft.  I was so astonished I stoppped the car and got out.  There was absolutely no sound and no movement.  The craft were black and metallic and the bottom appeared to have a ridge line.  I could see the sky between the two but they were probably no more than 20 to 25 feet apart.  At this point, I became extremely frightened and jumped in my car and sped away home.  Calls the next day to law enforcement offices, etc., turned up on other reports.  However, the airport authority was extremely interested and similar reports were received of a low flying, soundless object about an hour before mine approximately 50 miles north of this location. I had never heard of the boomerang or chevron craft before this time.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779
