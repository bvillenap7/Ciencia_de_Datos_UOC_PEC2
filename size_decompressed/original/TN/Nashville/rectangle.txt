A friend and myself were playing tennis at McGavock High School tennis courts this past Sunday, 06/01/2003.  Some golf tournament was going on the same weekend at a nearby park.  There was a large yellow blimp flying over head in the distance, west I think, the sun was behind me.  I always look up in the sky while out there, was a partly cloudy day.  I looked up, saw the blimp, there were some airplanes in the air, as we were relatively close to the airport.  I see alot of planes daily. Anyway, as I was looking up this one instant, I saw a white rectangular object, it appeard to be white, could have been a dull silver, very small, but not to small to tell the shape. It appeard to have cut across the path above the blimp. I only saw it for a second, then it was gone, I kept looking for it, but did not see it or a trail again. I told my friend I was playing tennis with, he did not see it, but he knows me well enough to know I was not lying.  Anyone else in Nashville see this????;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779
