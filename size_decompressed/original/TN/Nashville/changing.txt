Star-like ovoid with revolving object seen before dark, separates, approached by two triangular objects disappears.;2002-07-19 19:50:00;10 minutes;Star-like ovoid with revolving object seen before dark, separates, approached by two triangular objects disappears. I was on my deck and on my back stretching before dark tonight.  I observed a bright, and what seemed to be very high-altitude object overhead.  The sky was still too light for stars or planets, but it was similar to the size and intensity of Venus. I knew it wasn't Venus since it was directly overhead.  I ran into my house to grab my 8x25 power binoculars.  When I returned, the object had drifted slightly but was roughly in the same place.  I got on my back and observed the object through the binoculars.  I have very good eyesight and focused on the shiny object that seemed to be ovoid.  I then observed a small point of light revolving around the ovoid at a 7:00 to 1:00 attitude/orbit in a clock-wise direction with a frequency of about three seconds.  I ran back in the house to grab my cell phone and call a friend to describe what I was seeing.  When I returned, the object had drifted slightly to the southwest.  As I was describing my observations to my friend on the phone, the object suddenly and almost instantly separated into a group of approximately 20 to 30 small points.  There were no flames, colors or smoke to indicate any explosion.  It just seemed to separate.  Approximately three of the smaller objects were brighter and easier to see than the others, but it was now a distinguishable group of drifting objects.  I observed that the one piece that had been revolving around the ovoid was still in somewhat the same motion, but no longer around any object.  At first I thought it was falling, but then realized it was just drifting.  A few moments later, an object entered my field of vision approaching the group from the west and stopped.  It was about the same brightness as the original object but seemed to be triangular.  I thought it was a fighter jet, but it stopped.  Immediately, another triangular object of the same size and brightness approached the group from the north and stopped opposite the other object so as to surround the group from the east and west.  Just then, the group of objects d! isappear ed, and then the western triangular object disappeared.  The sky became hazy, and completely obscured the one remaining eastern triangular object.  The clouds remained for approximately 20 minutes and then dissipated. By that time the stars had begun to appear, and there was no sign of the objects.  Looking through your sighting reports, I saw a similar (but brief) description from someone in Hogansville, GA.  Any ideas what this could have been?;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779
It looked like a star then change to an elipse, then to blue and red, It lasted for at least two hours it was in the western sky at 4AM;2004-05-02 04:00:00;2 hrs;It looked like a star then change to an elipse, then to blue and red, It lasted for at least two hours it was in the western sky at 4AM At around 4 AM my wife called me out onto the patio.  In the western sky about 30 degrees above the horizon we say what at first looked a star but as we watched it it began to change color.  After around 20 minutes it began to chang shape from a star like object to an elipse.  It chaned color from white to red and blue.  It then began to pulse and seemed to grow larger.  This went on for about two hours,  It was still there when we went inside and retired for the morning.  On the following night at the same time we went back out to the patio to look for it again but it was not there. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a celestial body may have been the cause of the sighting.  Just a guess.  PD));36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779
Bright white light or spinning object.;2013-04-13 11:45:00;5 minutes;Bright white light or spinning obetct A friend and I were walking around downtown Nashville for exercise about 11:45 AM Saturday April 13th when a white bag flying through the sky just caught our attention.  As we looked at it floating a thousand or so feet to the northeast, we noticed a very faint light or a white abject that had to be at least 30 thousand feet in the sky changing shapes and directions.  It would have been the size of a star or maybe the size of Venus if the stars were out, maybe a little larger as I could tell there was movement.  It was directly above and beyond the bag and very hard to see and would not have noticed it otherwise.  The object was moving in a general SE direction but would take slight jumps up down and back and forward.  The movements were not smooth and very abrupt jaunts going back in the direction it came and then seeming to stop and then move on.  The object was either spinning and a shinny side was catching the sun or there was a light flashing. We could not ! tell. We watched the object for about 5 minutes and then lost site of it as we looked away. In those five minutes it would have traveled from the 12 o clock position to the three o clock position toward the sun.  If there was sound we could not tell as we were on a busy street.  There was a slight breeze and the temperature was about 66 degrees with almost totally clear skies.  There was not vapor trail left by the object.  I was able to view the object a little better with my sun glasses on as did my friend and we both had polarized sun glasses.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779
White light above highway, changed shape, then disappeared.;2016-01-03 16:30:00;~2 minutes;White light above highway, changed shape, then disappeared. Was driving down Briley Parkway, from Madison to the West side of Nashville.  The time I entered is an approximation, but it was daylight, not long before evening, and I was looking up at what seemed like a very bright star above the road in front of me.  I started thinking it looked more like something lower, like a plane, but it was just one white light and seemed stationary. While I was looking at it, it seemed to stretch or unfurl into a straight line.  When that happened, it looked more like a metallic thing, and the light (which before was all I could see) seemed to all move to the top, above the object...like it was either light reflecting off of it, or flame/exhaust shooting out of it. Then, it looked like it just shrunk into itself and disappeared, or maybe flew away in the direction perfectly away from me, so that it looked like it just shrunk into nothing.  Or maybe it just stopped reflecting light, it's hard to say. I saw another report from the 5th in a nearby area that sounded similar, so I decided to report mine as well.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779

Comet falling, then it split into 3 pieces, which flew in different directions and changed shape.;2018-11-17 18:30:00;30 seconds;Comet falling, then it split into 3 separate pieces, they flew in different directions and changed shape.  As they flew, they were shaped more horizontal. One disappeared, then the second one dropped down like a comet, and changed its shape back to a horizontal shape and disappeared, then, the 3rd one disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  We received another report about this sighting from a resident of the Nashville area, who reports that there were a number of comments about it on social media pages.  We believe the correct date of the sighting should be November 17, 2018, but will confirm that possibility with the source of this report.  We have temporarily amended the date, to reflect a sighting on November 17, 2018.  PD));36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779
