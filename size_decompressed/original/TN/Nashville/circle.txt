I was driving home from Missouri to Florida..near Nashville, TN at 2:32 in the morning, I saw a large circular craft in the sky. At fir;2002-03-23 02:32:00;5 minutes;I was driving home from Missouri to Florida..near Nashville, TN at 2:32 in the morning, I saw a large circular craft in the sky. At first I thought it was a plane, but it was hovering, not flying forward...I watched it and it continued to hover. The craft seemed to have three spokes, and there were bright lights at the end of each spoke. There was also a large blinking light in the center that was much brighter. I have no idea what it was, and don't even know if it was a real UFO, though it is certainly unidentified to me. Doesn't make sense to me that a UFO would have blinking light in the center. Also, since it was night, I am not certain whether it was a smaller object closer by, or a huge object at a distance. If other people near Nashville have reported a similar thing, then my report would further support theirs. ((ADDENDUM)) Dear ((deleted)), Thank you very much for the excellent report! I have no idea what the object you witnessed could have been.  Given your academic background, I would presume that you had ruled out all obvious possibilities, e.g. aircraft, blimps, advertising lights, celestial bodies, aurora borrealis, etc.. Did you stop your vehicle at any time to look at the object, or were you driving during the sighting, please?  Also, were you looking through the windshield or window, or did you roll down a window to look at it? We will post your report to our website, probably tomorrow, and perhaps others will respond from Nashville, if they saw it, or if they know what it was. Thank you very much for taking the time to share the information with our Center! Cordially, Peter Davenport ((RESPONSE)) i Peter, Certainly wasn't any plane, cause it wasn't moving like a plane...was hovering, then went kind of back and forth, whereas planes fly forward. At first, I thought it was a helicopter, but I that wouldn't explain the three glowing lights at the edges. And I know it was not any celestial body or aurora borealis.  I did not stop the vehicle and look...I was looking through the windshield, but the windshield was not obscuring or altering my view. I was not looking through a crack or dirty area. Moreover, as I passed, I got the same view of the object through my driver's side window as through the windshield. I tried to turn around, but I was on the interstate and couldn't turn around for like five or ten miles.  Feel free to post my sighting. The University of Tennesee has a Space Institute somewhere near there, so who knows, maybe it was an experimental aircraft. There were other people driving on the interstate that evening, I was hoping there had been other reports, and that someone would have more visual detail on the thing than I did. Collectively, we might have had an interesting report. Really wish I'd been carrying a camera with telephoto lens that night. ((name deleted));36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779

Pilot sees a Circular object hover and then goes to speed in one second, goes half mile and hovers again.;2005-02-17 13:30:00;2min 25sec;Pilot sees a Circular object hover and then goes to speed in one second, goes half mile and hovers again. I was standing outside behind my house watching the hawks fly around when I noticed a jet fly over.  Being a Commercial Pilot I am always drawn to watch them fly over.  As I was watching the jet a object to the jets left caught my eye.  By the way I have 20/15 in one eye and 20/20 in the other.  This object was circular in shape and appeared to be at least 500 ft to 2000 ft AGL depending on its size, which was hard to to determine. If it was 500ft it was around the size of a washing machine, if it was 2000 ft it was around the size of a truck or van.  It was a color between orange and gold in color.   This single object was hovering above the hill behind my house.  It would move side to side, no more than three or four times its width to each side.   I thought, Ok, I am seeing a hawk at a high altitude flying around in a tight circle but it wasn't a circle it was side to side.  I thought to myself a hawk isn't round or gold nore can it fly side to side so what is that?  About that time T-0 to T+20 sec. at T-20 it stopped and was completely still and remained frozen hovering there from T-20 until T-40 in between that time I rubbed my eyes to make sure there wasn't something in them.  There wasn't because I noticed it was still there frozen in the sky.  It seemed to glisten once.   I had a tree and a hill as a reference point as I am aware of the fact that without them objects can appear to move.  Anyway from around T-40 to T-60sec it started moving back and forth again.  Then from T-60 to T-80 it stopped and was frozen hovering there again in the same spot as the previous times.   Sometime around T-80 it accelerated from velocity V-0mph to its full observed speed of what I later estimate conservatively 180mph within one second V-180mph.  So T-80 to T-81 and V-0 to V-180.  OK?   I watched it move and pass behind the tall tree behind the house that doesn't have any leaves so I could still see it and it went at the same speed and altitude over to another hill that is over a half a mile away and stop/hover.  When it stopped it seemed to slow from V-180 to V-0 at a slower rate than it accelerated not by much though but it was a noticeable difference, my guess is 2 or 3 seconds V 180 to V-0.  It flew from point A to point B in less than ten seconds which are the basis for my speed estimates.  T-80 through T-90.   If the object was higher than I estimate, then the distance and speed would be much more than I estimated.  Anyway it stopped over the second hill and hovered there for another 20 seconds T-90 to T-110.  Then it moved back and forth again ,T-110 to T-130sec, and stopped frozen hovering there for about ten seconds T-130 to T-140.   Around this time it flew pretty much dew south from point B with the same type of velocity as before V-0 to V whatever speed ( fast ! )in one second and went out of my sight over the horizon of hills to the south which took around 5 seconds so T-140 to T-145sec.  The next day I called KBNA ATC and talked to the controler on duty the day before.  He was interested in my sighting but said that he hadn't noticed anything strange on radar that day.  I have flown privately and commercially for twenty years and am aware of all known aircraft and this was not one of them.   I have a BS degree in Aerospace and with a minor in Psychology.  I am 37 years old.  Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779
Silent White Orb UFO followed by other Unidentified Craft;2010-08-24 20:00:00;30 minutes (+or-);Silent White Orb UFO followed by other Unidentified Craft August 24, 2010 On August 24, 2010 around 8 pm or so, my girlfriend and I were relaxing outside our apartment in West Nashville, TN.  The sky was clear, with a full moon illuminating the sky considerably. While looking at the moon we witnessed a very bright, solid white, orb-like object float into our field of view.  We don’t know where it originated from as it seemed to have simply appeared. As we watched the light, we witnessed it accelerate fluidly and slow down just the same.  The object was able to make left, right, up, and down movements while changing altitudes quickly.  This object was totally silent, and it traversed the length of our house, but must have been at least a couple of miles away.   The light then moved behind the trees just behind our house.  Yet, being as bright as it was, we were still able to maintain visual contact and track its movement.  We were at this point standing on my neighbor’s porch, my girlfriend on my right, when the object vanished.  Simultaneously, a shooting white light shot off into space faster than lightening.  The light trail was almost imperceptible to the eye, and it’s duration a fraction of a second.  Almost like a reverse shooting star. At this point, we were stunned because we knew it was like nothing we had ever seen.  As we sat and discussed the object/light, we continued watching the sky. It couldn’t have been mo re than 5 or ten minutes since the other object vanished when we began to see multiple high-altitude aircraft flying towards the area where the object had been.  These aircraft made no sound, and had blue and red quick flashing/blinking lights.  These lights flashed quickly and they appeared to be set in a rectangular shape or pattern.  One after another, these aircraft continued to appear at what looked like the same altitude and speed the latter being hard to estimate.  At one point, it appeared these craft were assuming a triangular formation or were flying in a formation directly above where we witnessed the first object. I estimate seeing at least 10 of these aircraft, and I do not believe these were commercial aircraft.  I think it’s possible they were military in nature, and that they also may have been circling the area.  These aircraft eventually disappeared, maintaining the same direction, speed, and altitude.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779
Round fiery object moving across the sky at the same speed a plane travels.;2011-07-27 23:30:00;1-2 minutes;Round fiery object moving across the sky at the same speed a plane travels. We have a skyline view of all of Nashville.  Object was moving at the same speed that planes do through the sky (we watch them land).   Round object, fiery orange, looked like there was a flame inside at the bottom.   Thought it was a hot air balloon at night, but it moved too fast.   Moved out of sight and went up in the sky.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779
Extremely Low white circle moving horizontally in sky vanishing.;2012-04-11 21:45:00;less then a minute;Extremely Low white circle moving horizontally in sky vanishing. Me and my husband were on the  on ramp to interstate 24 from Bell Rd. In front of the Percy priest dam. I happened to look up and saw a Very low bright circle light. My first thought was an airplane because we are right next to the air port. But that wasn't the case. It was just above the tree line. My next thought was a shooting star but it was Way too low and had no tail. Basically it was moving in a horizontal  line, moving at incredible speed.  I watched it from about half my windshield to my driver side window. Until it completely disappeared.  It didn't fade away, or get smaller. It was almost like it vanished or went into some kind of hyper speed. When it disappeared the light got slightly wider.It was so low and apparent, I had time to realize this was not any kind of helicopter or air plane even a military jet. Second thought was a torpedo and I'm about to see a large blast.  This was non explainable.    Almost no words can explain what we saw.  I almos! t crashed the car because of what I watched transpire in front of me.  It was round, with a white glow. The hairs on my head stood up, and im still in shock.  It was so fluid of a motion that it looked like it was held up by a sting.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779

Two bright star-ish lights moving parallel over Nashville sky.;2013-10-05 20:00:00;30 seconds;Two bright star-ish lights moving parallel over Nashville sky Looking straight up in the clear night sky, we saw what at first appeared to be 2 extremely bright stars.  But looking at them for a few seconds we saw that they were moving.  If you held your hand up at about 1 o'clock over your head they were about 3 finger widths apart.  No blinking lights.  No other signs that they may be aircraft or satellites.  There were other standard aircraft in the area - likely commercial flights so it was easy to tell the difference of these lights.  Just big bright white lights.  No glowing.  They simply moved off at a consistent speed (not too fast, but steady) in parallel until out of sight.  At first I thought they were part of a constellation - that's how much like a bright star they appeared.  No photos were taken.

Bright, irregular, flashes across the night sky similar to alien Iridium flare.;2017-06-03 22:55:00;00:05;Bright, irregular, flashes across the night sky similar to alien Iridium flare. The object started near west (~260 deg) and continued to east alternating between very bright flashes and dim flashes over different intervals.  It crossed near the rate of a plane but very direct.  It was dusk with just a bit of light blue on the horizon and the stars of the Big Dipper were just becoming visible.  The brightness for a brief flash was as bright as the surface of the moon and was consistently brighter than Venus.  I checked HA ((www.Heavens-Above.com)), and nothing matched the discription.

One silver, one bright red, one bright blue circle lights interact in midday Nashville sky;2018-10-17 12:30:00;Several minutes;One silver, one bright red, one bright blue circle lights interact in midday Nashville sky I was sitting at a park in my car eating lunch.  I noticed a bright silver ball object hovering high in the sky.  I watched it for one minute trying to see if it would move but it did not.  It appeared to be glittering or twinkling.   Then, far to the right of the object a brilliant blue light appeared and shortly thereafter a scarlet red light below it.  (The red and blue lights also appeared ball like but were not scintillating like the silver ball.)  Then simultaneously the blue and red light moved towards the silver light and then stopped before meeting.  All three lights appeared to be locked in a formation like they were somehow connected.  Suddenly and slowly, they began to move together in the sky.   I watched for several minutes and thought I was filming them on my phone but as it turns out, I forgot to push record.  At the very beginning of the ordeal, I snapped a picture of the sky, hoping to catch something.   When I arrived home and zoomed in on the picture, I noticed that I captured the silver ball before the others appeared.   I have no explanation for what I saw and it was by far the most other worldly thing I have experienced in my life.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779

Then these lights would move in different patterns as if communicating. Then while this positioned craft was fluttering it’s lites there was a circle of moving lights going back and forth. Almost as if the positioned craft was directing these other circling movements of lights. After about an hour or more the heavy clouds started to disappear. Whatever it was, used the thickness of the clouds to hover behind to do whatever it was doing. Very unusual activity I’ve never seen before!! Nor will I forget!;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779
