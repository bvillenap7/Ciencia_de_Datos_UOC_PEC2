At first, I thought it was a large object that was, more or less, a good distance away, until I noticed it's reflection in the water.  At that point, I realized that the object was about the size of a golf ball and about 100 feet away. It's color was white and reminded me of a small dim refridgerator light bulb. Suddenly, it stopped hovered motionless for 3 minutes then shot off in a parabolic arc upwards.  It started off away from me, then arced or curved upwards.  That's all I have.

sudden burst of brilliant yellow light;1975-06-01 23:59:00;seconds;sudden burst of brilliant yellow light a friend and I were moving an old floor model Atwater-Kent radio from one apartment to another. it was midnight and we were on the side walk with the radio when all of a sudden we were bathed in a brilliant yellow glow that covered the whole apartment parking lot. We were so startled by the sudden burst of light that we dropped the radio on the sidewalk.We looked up to see a blinding yellow glow moving off into the distant sky. The sky reminded me of a black top road with a freshly painted yellow line down the middle as this light flew off into the night. Then the yellow hue we were standing in started to fade away as if someone were working a dimmer switch. This thing made no noise what so ever. When we plugged in the radio laterit never worked better. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779
Pure pulsating light, moved strangely in the sky, best described is like the minute hand on a clock, you can't see it move but you know;1999-03-15 04:00:00;4-5 minutes;Pure pulsating light, moved strangely in the sky, best described is like the minute hand on a clock, you can't see it move but you know it has? I and a friend were setting in my car outside of his house early in the morning (I am terribly unsure of the date (1998-1999). We are usually talking really in-depthly about life or philosophy and I was on a rant, when independently from each other we begin watching a light in the sky (keep in mind I was continuing to talk thinking nothing of the light at first). The next part is were it gets weird because I have heard no one ever describe the movement or actually the speed of the movement of a U.F.O in such a way: There are plenty of trees and power lines that acted as reference points and we were not shifting our positions or even our heads (certainly not to the degree the object moved)... As I continued to talk (on my rant, we still had not made it known to each other we were both watching it), this pure white light that was pulsating slowly seemed to move up (up like into the upper atmosphere, not North), and it moved back down, what is strange is the following: The way it moved was kind of odd because it was a keen to watching the minute hand of a clock (you can not really see it moving but you know it has by it's relation to other things on the clock face). It moved in a weird pulsating slow way up and down as I said extremely slowly. I used a utility line that was right in front of my windshield as a reference point, and the light would move above and below the line by some distance (the power line as I said is a reference to knowing the thing moved not a reference as to how big or how far away it was, because the power line was extremely closer to us than the light was). By this time my rant had ceased as I was watching this light move up and down in nonsensical ways. I asked my friend if he was watching the light (his head had been pointing in the general same direction mine had been) and he said yes. So now both of us had watch independently the light move in this weird way. We got out of the car and stood at the front to see it better and it continued briefly doing what it had been doing, before it began to pulsate, I guess you could say at a slower modulation (meaning it wasn't just blinking on and off for longer duration's of time but rather it pulsated at a slower rate almost like a heart beat slows down but more smoothly and of course visually). When the pulsating change to the slower rate, it seemed to be losing it's consistency and actually seemed like you could look through it if you were close enough. It would come back a little strong then go back to being weak but never as strong as it originally was. It did this until it pulsated slowly into nothingness (meaning it looked kind a like how a candle does when the wax builds up so much that the flame is just barley flickering slowly and then goes out very gently). I thought it was all over when the next thing I knew, an airplane, flying extremely fast and low (keep in mind, we live reasonably close to an airport and there are always planes in the sky, passenger jumbos and smaller personal planes, as well as helicopters. So although I can not be for certain because all I could see were its lights and speed (and hear its roar!) but my guess is it was a military plane. The lights on the plane were brilliant blue and red on each wing (a blue light on one wing and a red on the other) and they alternated VERY FAST (faster than I had ever seen lights blink on a plane before), it was almost like a strobe effect. The plane made a beeline for where the light had been at, in an almost perfectly straight line. The plane came out of the West/Northwest sky where Fort Cambell army base is about a county or two to our West (the object was in the North/Northeast sky). I can not state enough how fast the lights strobed from wing to wing, back and forth (I do not know if that is a sign of a military airplane or not, but it&#8217s the only plane I have ever bore witness to whose lights strobed that fast). I and my fiend do not do drugs, we had not been drinking, and although we have expressed interest in U.F.O. and Art Bell related topics, the last thing we thought we would ever be witnesses to was an actual U.F.O. If you e-mail people back about their requests, I was wondering if there had been any other sightings in our area similar to this. My brother supposedly has seen a similar object but did not pay as much attention to it as me and my friend had.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779

There were no flashing lights so I took one step back onto my porch to get my binoculars and stepped back out and the light was gone.  Just gone.  I went and got my mom to come look with me but there was nothing. It was brighter and larger than any planets I have ever seen in the night sky.  It was moving slowly towards the North East.  There was no sound.  I live close to the airport and I see all types of airplanes everynight.  This did not appear to be an airplane because it just disappeared.  It did not appear to be a meteorite because it was moving too slow.  I don't know what it was.  I listen to Art Bell and I have heard about all the lights in the sky so I decided to report this. I have never reported anything before even though I have had sightings before.  6 years ago my mom and I saw a craft being chased by a military plane low over a lake close to my house.  But who do you report it too? Now, I know a place. You all.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779

Then it flashed again (white);1999-10-14 22:10:00;11 minutes;I saw a light flash like a plane out in my back yard but it didn't flash again so it caught my attention. Then it flashed again (white).   After it flashed about 3 more times, I called my mom and she came out and then my teenage son and his friend.  We started timing it and it flashed every 10 to 13 seconds only.  I could see it in my binoculars only when it flashed.  It was SSE in line with Jupiter.  It would move up and back and sideways but you could only see it when it flashed.  Then there was a streak of light and we all screamed and it was gone.  There was no sound. I had gone outside and was sitting on my back steps before Iwent to bed and was looking at the sky.  A plane was going over pretty high up and I was watching it, when a single flash occured out in front of the plane.  I thought the plane had shot something out of it.  The plane went on and I was still looking where I saw the flash and it flashed again.  So I sat there and watched it.  It was just a bright flash, not as bright as Jupiter though.  But it looked like that.  I yelled for mom and she came out and it continued this slow flash but moving around.  It would be more north then it would flash the next time over to the East and then South but it always stayed in a pretty small area.  I called for my son who is 15 and his friend and we stood out back and watched it.  Planes continued to go over but this just stayed there.  I ran inside got the phone and called my uncle in KY to see if he could see it. I was trying to explain to him where to look but with it only flashing about every 13 seconds it was hard to tell him where.  Then there was a brighter flash headed east with a long trail behind it like a shooting star and then the flasher was gone.  We all screamed when whatever it was flew across the sky because it was so bright.  My mom saw a red streak come out of it headed due east when it was just the two of us out there but I did not see that.  My mom is 58 years old and psychologically stable.  My son is 15 and attends an academic prepatory high school.  His friend is also 15 and goes to a local high school.  He was scared.  I am 41 years old.  I used to work with a local Mufon group here in Nashville but have not been in contact with them for about 5 years.  I have always wanted to see a UFO because I believe they are out there but this tonight was the most unusual thing I have ever seen.  I told my son's friend it was probably something of ours (from the USA) so he would not be so scared.  Maybe it was a satellite, if they can stop and move in 4 different directions and then take off and lea! ve a whi te trail.  I very much doubt it though.  My uncle reported he had observed the same type thing 2 or 3 nights ago (in Paducah, KY) and watched it for awhile and went to bed.  It was in the south.  He said it was a slow flash like what we saw.  I asked him who I should call and he said no one, just enjoy it and go on to bed.  But I had to tell you all.  I have written one other time to tell about a gold light that I saw one night headed north that disappeared but that could have been too many different things.  This tonight was unlike anything I have ever seen.  Thank you for letting me tell you about it.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779
Viewed a UFO through bedroom window on Christmas Eve, as its bright lights woke me up kept me awake for over an hour as it moved slowl;1999-12-25 04:00:00;1 hour+;Viewed a UFO through bedroom window on Christmas Eve, as its bright lights woke me up kept me awake for over an hour as it moved slowly across the Williamson County, TN horizon. I awoke around 4:00 am on Christmas morning due to a bright light outside my window.  I'm a light sleeper, but I was roused from my slumber because I felt like something was out-of-place.  It was a weird intuitive feeling that someone/something was outside peering in.  I had the window blinds open and since I'm nearsighted, the bright light was blurry and very large (grapefruit size) through the glass, until I put my glasses on, then as the light came into focus, I could tell that it was something in the sky.  I watched it for a bit, but after seeing that the light was stationary, my curiousity prevented me from going back to sleep.  The light hovered it was not a airplane or helicopter.  And there were smaller red lights, located around the edges of the white central light, which blinked slowly.  As I watched the light through the window on and off for over an hour (I finally got up and got ready for a trip to see family), I noticed that the light moved from window pane to another meaning that it was slowly moving across the sky.  The UFO was hovering above the ground at what I would estimate at several hundred feet (a little higher than a radio or cell tower).  My window faces south/southwest so the UFO was hovering above northern Williamson County, TN I live in southern Davidson County near Brentwood.  My apt. is on the 3rd floor atop a good-sized hill, so I have a fantastic view of the horizon through my bedroom window. I'm a 31-year old, well-educated, white male, and I have seen UFOs before, but I've never reported one until now.  A UFO that I saw a couple of years ago hovering in urban Nashville was seen by several people and the local newspaper (Tennessean) ran an article, but I did not notice an article regarding this UFO siting.  This siting was extremely vivid and I'm convinced that it was real because the image has stuck with me, I've decided to report it to someone that might find the information useful.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779
Slow moving lights in the sky over Nashville.;2001-04-29 14:00:00;5-10 minutes;Slow moving lights in the sky over Nashville. We saw as many as three objects (they were very hard to see) that appeared to be at a very high altitude traveling slowly towards the West. They were directly overhead at the time of the sighting. The path they took appeared to be slow with variations in speed and slight changes in direction. The distance between the objects is hard to estimate but appeared to be quite far. The altitude for each may have been different as well as one appeared to be easier to see than the others. The objects appeared to be lights that never blinked or changed in brightness. The weather conditions were very good for this day -- clear skys, very little haze. I've never seen a weather balloon, but the paths the objects took seemed to indicate a light-weight object traveling wind currents. I have video of the closest object.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779

lights circling inside clouds over Nashville;2004-12-12 22:00:00;30 min.;lights circling inside clouds over Nashville My wife and I were driving on I-40 westbound on Sunday night, coming back to Nashville from east Tennessee. After passing the Lebanon exit, I began noticing lights moving inside the clouds closer to Nashville. As we got closer, I could tell that they looked like spot lights shining down from above or inside the clouds instead of from below, and they were moving in large circles. This night we saw two of them moving in large circles and figure eights from east to west over Nashville. One of the main reasons I became so interested was that my wife and I have seen similar lights before.  I filed a report back in 8/03 about lights we saw clrcling around inside the clouds during a big thunderstorm. We had pretty much conviced ourselves that this earlier sighting was a spotlight promoting something, or maybe lights from the Starwood Ampitheater, which we're kind of near (although I don't know why anyone would have continued to shine these types of lights during one of the biggest thunderstorms of the summer). These lights looked almost exactly the same and were moving in almost the same fashion, except there were only two instead of four. So now we had a chance to try to find the source of these lights and prove to ourselves that we weren't seeing anything out of the ordinary.  We closed in on the city from about 30 miles out and the lights became increasingly obvious. I'm sure other cars must have seen them, but there's no way to know. I had slowed down a lot because I was fascinated by these lights clrcling and seemingly swooping around just above the cloud ceiling. We kept expecting one to become more visible or distinct though a break in the clouds, but it never happened. They stayed very fuzzy and shapeless. The lights would circle opposite each other, then move together and back apart or do some crazy zig zag. However, we never saw a beam of light from the ground, and that was primarily what we were looking for.  We got off the interstate on Stewarts Ferry Pk., when we thought we were finally getting below the lights, and went east. I was driving, but my wife could still see them northeast of us, so I took a left on Lebanon Pk and went north. Now we were very close to the Nashville airport, but the general movement of the lights seemed to be to the northwest and we could never get under them. We were also getting around more city lights and it was harder to see them, and they seemed to be farther away from us. We were tired from our drive so we went on home, but we satisfied ourselves that these lights were not originating from spotlights on the ground. I don't know that it proves anything about the first lights we saw, but it makes me wonder. I know other people must have seen these lights, as they were all over above the city, so I'm hoping someone else will come forward.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779
Lightning fast light shoots and disappears in Nashville sky.;2005-04-04 04:00:00;3 Seconds;Lightning fast light shoots and disappears in Nashville sky. May have been a shooting star, but I don't know.  I haven't seen a shooting star since I was really young and my memory was them appearing much smaller and obvious that they were far away.  Anyway, I was smoking a cigarette leaning against the trunk of my car in the parking lot of my apartment complex about 10 miles south of downtown Nashville, TN at about 4am.  I was sort of looking up and relaxing (getting my mind off my work, as I work from home on my computer.)  I noticed the normal few stars you can see here with the naked eye (nothing like you can in rural areas, like Vermont where I'm from.)  So I noticed the couple brighter ones, but not knowing much about them I can't tell you if the particularly bright one is Mars or the North Star or whatever.  Anyway, I glanced down as I flicked ashes but at that moment a flash in my peripheral or something caused me to look up to my left...  But it was sort of in a way that you might look at a lower flying plane (we see them all the time because the airport is kind of close.  They aren't low enough to be really loud, just enough to spot their lights if you're out driving in the area, etc.)  Anyway, I sort of casually looked over.  And focused on a light which may or may not have been stationary when I first saw it (hard to remember this all happend in a matter of less than 5 seconds.)   Anyway, I realized in like a milisecond that it wasn't a plane because it was to far off, but at the same time didn't see to be in space.  It was sort of like a star's light, only softer if that makes sense.  Anyway, by the time I focused on it it shot acrossed a good percentage of the sky ridiculously fast parallel to the ground (from my vantage point.)  It's still hard to picture it moving that fast again, but I do recall somewhat of a streak.   Then all in those same couple seconds it disappeard.  But didn't fissle out, it looked as if it dissappeard behind a wall.  I also don't know if it was my imagination but the light seemd to be almost a soft white/blue color.  Not where you'd be like wow that's flourescent blue, but I think you know what I mean.  Anyway, my thought was, for it to have moved acrossed that much sky, as far out as space, it would have to have been moving ridiculously fast.  Obviously the closer an object would be, it move acrossed a chunk of sky more quickly.  Not sure which scientific law that is, but it's common sense anyway.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779

Flying through the sky at a very slow rate of speed was what appeared to be a green stream of light that was moving in a manner that made it seem alive and not a craft. It was flying no more than 20-30 feet above me due east for approximately 30-40 seconds when a spark of light materialised at the head of the stream and seemed to reveal a vague ring shape with bright white flamelike sparks of light emanating from inside the outer portion of the ring towards the center and right before the sparks met in the middle the whole thing dissapeared. The object made no sound which was strange to me as it was flying so low. The movement of the object was fluid and slightly undulating which the only way I could make a rational human comparison when I told my wife was that it moved and had a vague physical resemblance to a jellyfish. I have never seen anything like it nor have I ever heard or read of anything like it but since it happened I have found similar sightings reported online.  This was not a firework, or any light abberation or distortion. It was vivid, close and highly visible with more than enough time for me to size it up and find a logical explanation. I would like to know if anyone else saw it that night. I have never seen a ufo and am a rational intelligent person who has never ruled out the possibility of life beyond this world but at the same time never convinced by the limited knowledge of reported sightings and lack of first hand evidence. What I saw changed that for me forever.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779

Same occurrence 2 nights this week – first 2-13-16 second tonight, 2-19-16.  Both nights around same time.  Both nights with same amount of cloudiness, just big temperature difference.  Initially appear similar to spotlights but (1) no trail of light (2) each would disappear behind clouds randomly (3) area of night sky coverage too immense (4) somewhat circular flight pattern while moving across sky (5) immediate change of direction at random times (6) quick change in speed of movement. Viewing from southeast Davidson County, Tennessee (Nashville).  Two roundish/oval lights moving separately, crossing over one another at times and each would occasionally disappear behind clouds.  Both with variation in speed of movement.  Quickly changed directions, even a complete 180 at times.  Viewing location less than 10 miles from airport with fair amount of air traffic.  All lights on planes were clear and crisp, commercial airplanes far smaller than the 2 orb-sha! ped lights and undoubtedly flying much lower in the sky than location of the 2 orb-lights. I took videos on the night of 2-13 but only had my iPhone and the videos don't do justice.

Bright orange light in the sky, appeared to be two separate lights when zoomed in.

One object seen near two cell towers, no movement.  Recorded a video of the object, and when zoomed in, it seemed as if there were two lights with a small gap between them, but farther away it looked like just one light.  Lights were a very bright orange, similar to a street lamp, but shaped like straight lines. After one minute of no changes, object began to shrink and turn white, and then faded out after approximately 2 minutes of observation.  Moments after the object faded out of sight, I heard several loud popping noises in quick succession from the direction the object was located, unable to determine if the noises are related or unrelated.  Unknown how long it had been there before I saw it. Object was sighted near an Air Force base and an airport.  I am the only direct observer that I am aware of, but I did record a video of the entire event as it happened.  I returned to the spot the next morning to take a picture of the area during the day to verify that there was nothing between me and the object I recorded, as well as no signs or lights that could account for the object's appearance.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779
Cluster of White Dots;2016-10-22 16:30:00;15 minutes;Cluster of White Dots Cluster of at least 16 white dots moved across the sky slowly.  They all seemed to move independent of each other.  They eventually disappeared into some very high clouds.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779
2 ufo lights grew brighter and then faded and moved south.;2017-11-25 18:00:00;30 seconds;2 ufo lights grew brighter and then faded and moved south. 2 large bright lights appeared out of nowhere in the sky.  They were beside each other with space in between.  The lights grew suddenly brighter and bigger.  They were not moving at the time.   Within 10 seconds of their brightest the lights began to fade simultaneously.  They dimmed to barely visible and moved in perfect formation south until I could see them no more.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779

Fast moving lights above downtown Nashville.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly advertising lights??  PD));2019-09-21 23:00:00;30 minutes;Fast moving lights above downtown Nashville I was out with friends in Nashville on a Saturday night.  We had proceeded to the rooftop of a business located on Broadway.  I looked up towards the AT&T “bat building “ and noticed around 4 lights zipping around the sky above the building.  They would disappear for a few moments then suddenly return.  Objects were making sudden direction changes and quick accelerations.  The objects were not necessarily always witnessed at once but maybe 2, then a 3rd or 4th would return.   I have a Bachelor’s degree in math and physical science and have always enjoyed stargazing.

While walking back to the car, I looked up at the sky to get another view of the stars. As I was fixed on looking at these two stars that were very clear to see, one of them moved quick  to the left, and then moved extremely fast across the sky and disappeared. As soon as I first saw it move, I told my friend to look, but it disappeared so fast he didn’t get a chance to look. They laughed when I told them why I wanted them to look. It just looked like a star, until it moved the way it did. No shooting star could make such a sharp angle the way it did, nor would it accelerate from a stand still. It has been weighing on my mind because it was so bizarre, and I wish someone else witnessed it because I know what I saw.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779
We observed lights traveling in some formation following each other at a high rate of speed ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-13 20:30:00;10 min;We observed lights traveling in some formation following each other at a high rate of speed and possibly very high altitude from southwest to northeast and also one large orb type object moving to the south west.  The altitude could not be predicted in the night sky but there were no normal aircraft lights.  I also called a friend miles away that confirmed the sighting that my wife and I witnessed;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779

It didn’t move so I ruled out a plane. I didn’t see a light trail out source. It changed from several lights to a single source or so appeared. No sound. I never saw the actual object creating the light. I do not know what I was seeing.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779
Satellites don't change direction;2021-07-28 21:15:00;30 seconds;Satellites don't change direction Went to sit out on the deck with a cigar, and noticed one bright star in the sky. Was looking at it, then it faded out. Several minutes later, Looked back at the area where the light was thinking that clouds had covered it and wondered if it was visible again. Small speck of light moving north-east caught my eye and I figured it was a satellite. I watched it proceed, then curve toward the North in a large arc. Suddenly, it changed direction again and moved to the East at about the same speed without stopping. It finally disappeared from my view.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779
