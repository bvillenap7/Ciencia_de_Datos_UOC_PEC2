silver cigar shape;1999-09-25 20:00:00;1 minute?;silver cigar shape I'm not sure if what I saw is anomalous or not, but it seemed odd to me. It was a silver/metallic, apparently cigar shaped object (maybe smaller in the middle?). I couldn't see any wings and it didn't make any noise that I could hear. An airplane passing below it going in the opposite direction (eastish?) made me notice that the object didn't have any sort of lights- only the reflection of the sun on its surface. I know nothing about airplanes. The only thing I can tell you about how high it was is that the airplane below it (a big commercial one coming in for a landing at Nash. airport) was red in the setting sun and the object was still in bright sunlight. It didn't zip across the sky it was there before the airplane flew over and it was there for a while after it was gone. It moved in a precise, high arc across the sky.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779

The weather was sunny and a few clouds. We saw the UFO in plain site with no obstruction of view. We observed it for 2 minutes and it disappeared going east.

It went over a plane but was way above itand then I saw a bright flash from it again and then it went away from where I was then disappeared again.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779
Thick white line UFO with round light on end seen floating over Nashville, TN.  ((NUFORC Note:  Contrail??  PD));2015-03-15 12:30:00;2 minutes;Thick white line UFO with round light on end seen floating over Nashville, TN. While driving down US 65 through Nashville, TN, my husband and I noticed a bright straight line flying in the sky.  At first we thought it was a plane, and then a bird.  But as we examined it further, we noticed it was a UFO. It looked like a thick white line with a round white light at one end of it.  It was hovering very slowly and moving in strange patterns.   After 2 minutes of staring at it in complete awe, it disappeared into seemingly nowhere. ((NUFORC Note:  Contrail??  PD));36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779

It was moving west to east at a normal speed.  When the craft was exactly due east of my location - and I had determined it defiantly did not have strobes in a blink of an eye changed direction to going straight up increased speed and vanished in less than a second.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779
