It was a sphere lit up about 500 feet away over an interstate by a dam in the local hermitage area.;2007-07-21 00:30:00;about 30 mins;It was a sphere lit up about 500 feet away over an interstate by a dam in the local hermitage area. Went out to smoke with my fiance' at about 30 after midnight. About 500 feet away over a local dam we saw what we thought was a local water tower lit up. We soon realized this was not near the tower. This thing whatever it was was huge and lit up. It was not moving and looked like for a bit it was on top of some trees. We have no clue what this object was but when we came back out after going back in it was gone.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779
Multiple Red Orange luminous obects flying in formation over Nashville, Tennessee;2009-07-18 20:55:00;15 Minutes;Multiple Red Orange luminous obects flying in formation over Nashville, Tennessee Approximately, 8:55 pm CDT, Saturday, July 18, 2009, 7.7 miles northeast from Nashville, Tennessee. I witnessed Red Orange luminous objects flying from northwest to southwest.  There was 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 luminous objects, and disappearing as they go southwest. Another group formed a line of 5 with equal distance.  One of those objects broke off going west and another one went east. Next, 5 more objects flew in the same pattern. Then 4 objects together flew in a diamond formation.  One of the four seemed illuminated brighter than the others within the group.  I saw these objects in a clear night sky.  When the unidentified flying objects flew over the area the dogs in the neighborhood began to bark. I did not recognize any sirens going off at the time. These objects did not have any engine sounds coming from them like a conventional plane, military aircraft or helicopter.  There was no starboard, port, or flashing lights emitting from these objects.  They stayed in a consistent glow except for one that came at the end.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779
First Military Planes, Then Comes The UFO.;2011-02-10 20:00:00;15 min;First Military Planes, Then Comes The UFO. At around 8pm, my brother and I witnessed strange occurences in the Nashville night sky.  We noticed alot of aircraft flying in the same direction(west).  Moments after, this strange beam of light appeared in almost the exact location of the other crafts.  It just sat there for about fifteen minutes then slowy move toward the west. We see alot of aircrafts coming and going form Fort Cambell and this was no ordinary craft. My first reaction was maybe a ufo had crashed, that would explain all of the aircrafts in the area.  I believe that people will see alot of human aircrafts right before seeing a ufo because the military knows about ufo's.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779
Yellow/Orange/Red Sphere seen in up close, in Middle TN.;2011-07-01 22:00:00;15 seconds;Yellow/Orange/Red Sphere seen in up close, in Middle TN. I was walking from my bedroom into the living room when something caught my eye. From my living room door, which is comprised of a solid glass panel, I witnessed a sphere, spinning outside, hovering approximately 6 inches above the concrete slab patio. The sphere was very close to my door, less than 3 ft from where I was standing inside. It was larger than a basketball, solid, and perfectly symmetrical. There were dime sized holes covering the sphere, perfectly spaced, approximately 1.5 inches from each other. Bright lights were emitting from these holes, changing colors, from red to orange to yellow. The sphere was spinning slowly and horizontally, from left to right. I was so stunned that I stopped in my tracks. I watched the object, while I called out in wonder to the individuals in an adjacent room, who could see me looking outside. They kept asking, “What is it?” so I turned to tell them, and when I looked back, the object was gone.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779

Group of 7 white flashing and disappearing flying objects;2019-11-09 14:00:00;5 minutes;group of 7 white flashing and disappearing flying objects I was sitting in my backyard Saturday afternoon in Nashville, TN. I noticed 7 white round objects flying, then after watching for a few seconds, they flashed individually and disappeared. They re-appeared a few seconds later. I thought they could be birds but looked to be very far away, and there were 2 airplanes flying behind them leaving trails in the sky they looked to be around the same height and distance as the objects from my vantage point, and these objects were as large as the planes. You can see the trails in the videos I'm sending. I watched this happen multiple times then had the idea to take my phone out and get some video. I got 3 videos of the occurrence with the 2nd one (video_1.mov in the email I'm sending you) as the most clear. However you can see them in all 3. I have shown multiple people the videos and it was suggested I submit them to someone as it does not look to be natural. After I got the videos I was fairly disturbed and went inside to show my wife, so I do not know how much longer it went on.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779

On August 8 in Nashville TN at around 7:50 to 8:20 pm I and 4 other people saw 2 black dots/spheres in the air.;2020-08-08 19:50:00;25 minutes;On August 8 in Nashville TN at around 7:50 to 8:20 pm I and 4 other people saw 2 black dots/spheres in the air. They were far but in the beginning could easily be seen with the naked eye, after about 20 minutes though the two spheres had drifted further to the point that is was hard to see with naked eye but relatively easy with binoculars. The objects were moving west at a very slow pace and were passing through clouds every couple of minutes. In the picture I took with my phone the objects look almost touching because of the quality of the photo but with the binoculars it is very clear that the two spheres are not touching but floating parallel with a little bit of distance between them.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779
