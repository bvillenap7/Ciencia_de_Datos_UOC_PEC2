Cylinder, shape surrounded by mist, chased by black helicpter.;2014-03-19 11:00:00;1-2 minutes;Cylinder, shape surrounded by mist, chased by black helicpter. What I saw was I believe cylinder shape, it was very cold, perfectly blue sky.  I watched it come from the west, no sound at all.  What was odd about it, was it looked like it may have been about 40-50 long, but was covered in mist, with maybe a 25 foot con-trail, that quickly disappeared.   As it started to come over our parking lot, I started to hear a helicopter coming from the North(probably from Fort Campbell).  As soon as the copter was heard, the object made a 90 degree turn, straight up.   When the black copter (no markings) got there, no more than 3-4 seconds, it was gone. The copter turned and headed back North.   Also, I would like to say please keep up the great work, you, Mr. Davenport, Stanton Friedman, and the, late, dear, Dr. Roger Leir are great heroes of mine.  You've all given up so much for the pursuit of the truth.  Keep your eyes to the skies, I do. 6/77 Otis Reservoir MA.  reported 05/27/03 (me also) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
