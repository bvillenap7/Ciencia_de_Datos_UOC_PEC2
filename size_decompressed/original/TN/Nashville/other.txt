8 rocket pay load for emissary  sen. J. glenn  sts-95  ((NUFORC Note:  Nature of report is unclear to us.  PD));1998-10-29 19:00:00;5 minutes;8 rocket pay load for emissary  sen. J. glenn  sts-95 I was coming out of a bookstore in south Nasville and I almost bumped into a lady staring up into the sky.  I turned to look and witnessed 7-8 rockets side by side coming out of the sunset, plumes mixed in gigantic trail.  Senator Glenn's purpose was reportedly elderly astronuat medical experiments.  But I could find no report of the other launches that day. ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the source of this report is implying.  He called us over the Hotline, but we did not understand the call, either.  He seemed to believe that the sighting had something to do with UFO's, but we did not understand what the relationship was.  Source of report provides no contact information with his written report.   STS-95 was launched on October 29, 1998, we have learned over the internet.

Serpentine object with windows.;2003-11-12 22:05:00;20 seconds;Serpentine object with windows. I am not crazy, I do not drink, and I am not making this up. I am posting this only  because I need to tell someone and do not know who to ask about it. Around 10pm I was out on my deck. As far as the background, the sky was off & on cloudy and the moon almost full. I have to call the shape of this thing serpentine, like 1 & 1/2 letter Ss, and because it moved snake-like as it went across the sky at a good speed. Definitely was no type of airplane, helicopter or blimp. There were approximately 10 windows lit up. I cannot imagine how any kind of weather balloon or kite could travel in this pattern while the windows maintained level throughout the entire path like it did. I have never seen or heard of anything like this. Please tell me if anyone else has.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779
A Shapeshifting Black Balloon Flashed A Red Light At Me;2004-07-27 18:00:00;10-15 minutes;A Shapeshifting Black Balloon Flashed A Red Light At Me I don't know why my report from that day was not posted.  I even spoke to the rep. at NUFORC who seemed to not want to hear many details for whatever reason.  Therefore I am posting this again.  On the date and time specified I saw a black balloon floating high in the sky as I sat on my balcony at my apartment complex.  It was a hot July evening.  I noticed the balloon and stood up to look at it.  I thought of a contest we had in Sunday school as a child in which we were all given helium ballons to tie our names and phone numbers to so that if our balloon was found we would receive a call from whomever found it.  The one found from the farthest place was the winner. Suddenly the balloon shifted into a horizontal shape and I could see what appeared to be heat waves like you see when you look down a road on a hot day. This balloon morphed back and forth from vertical balloon shape to horizontal oblong shape a few times as it moved lower in the sky and began to pass over my apartment.  I ran through my apartment to the front door.  When I emerged from the apartment the balloon was just above my apartment. It passed over me at that height and then a slit opened and a red light flashed and the slit closed.  It continued along over the next hill and morphed a few more times.  It made no sound whatsoever.  I don't know what I saw.  If you know please tell me. I have since seen a video clip of a similar thing from Bristol Va. a few days later in August of that year.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779
Large white/green ball trailing green crap behind it close to green hills in Nashville.;2007-09-01 23:00:00;3-5sec;Large white/green ball trailing green crap behind it close to green hills in Nashville. In short this was seen by myself and and a local news reporter also.I saw this from a third floor deck in the 37221 zip looking over percy warner park towards green hills ,it looked like it was over the Green hills area which is another zip code but not far.Late in the summer of 07 not sure of exact date,but looked like a white globe with green to light green smoke or mist?? coming off the back end of it.I might have been 4 to 10 miles away, but at that distance a plane normally looks a third of the size of what I saw.I have never seen things that were not there,don't hear stuff either. I was not with the news guy when I saw this, but my friend who knows him said he saw the same thing a week or so later.This thing came in fast and then I could not see it any more. No impact was reported and I am sure more people saw it than us two.I have a couple of degrees and a carry permit they don't give those to crazy people,This was too big to make it that close to the ground without breaking up first and no impact was reported.I'm very far from stupid,and have seen many shooting stars etc etc.This was quite different...That's all I got.

White light on small lunar lander shaped object.;2012-10-27 22:00:00;60 seconds;White light on small lunar lander shaped object UFO Sighting I was driving north on second ave. Downtown Nashville TN. While stopped at a traffic light on the corner of 2nd ave.  And Korean veterans pkwy.  I saw a white light coming towards me traveling in a southwestern direction.  At first i thought it was an airplane but then i noticed it was lower than it seemed.  There was a tall building in front of me and i thought since it was of normal airplane altitude, it would go behind the building, but it went in front of the building. S o then i knew it was quite a bit lower than it seemed.  Maybe 100 feet off the ground.  I was able to get a pretty good look at it considering it was quite low.  It looked like a very small lunar lander, maybe 3 to 4 feet across.  It seemed to have very stable flight, very smooth.  Ruling out a flying toy or something like that.  It was traveling at about 30 to 40 MPH.  The street light turned green and i started moving while continuing to watch it as it moved passed me still traveling in a southwestern direction.   I then stopped at the next light and looked for it again and found it on the same path but climbing higher.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779

So I grabbed my cell phone and started recording it and it got really really bright and atsyed there for approximately 7 minutes, I tried to grab my telescope and when I looked back the solid light was gone and the other one stopped flashing and as it got closer I could see two lights and a purple light underneath and it went right over my house as I filmed it.  I thought it was a police helicopter because it stayed put so long but as it passed over it clearly was not it was more of a box shape with a back that stretched into a triangle shape.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779
Three white spheres separate, then connected and rotating in the afternoon.;2013-04-13 15:45:00;~15 minutes;Three white spheres separate, then connected and rotating in the afternoon. My two boys and I (ages 6 and 7) were playing baseball in the backyard when I just thought I should look up for a vague but unknown certain reason, if that makes sense.  Look! Parachuters!, I yelled, noticing two bright white spots just hanging in the sky, seeming to drift around.  The sky was a deep blue with just one large wispy feather-like cloud stretching from over our heads to the horizon.  Visibility was excellent.   One of my boys pointed out a third object.  We watched for a while as they moved further away, maybe higher, couldn't tell. I am terrible at judging heights, so I will not try to guess their altitude.  Two of them were in the same general area.  One was off to the northeast of the others.  My husband pointed out to the boys that these couldn't be parachuters because they were not coming down.   Then I decided they weren't going to vanish because they weren't darting around or just staying still like ufos are often reported to do.  I though! t they must be weather balloons. I ran inside, came back out with the binoculars and couldn't get an eye on them.  They finally got too far away to see.   I gave up, went in for water and ate a little snack, came back and there was another one, or one came back, just as low as when I first spotted them.  This time I supported my elbows on the trunk of my car and got a good look through the binoculars.  I watched this thing for about five minutes.  Maybe more.  There were three large spheres all apparently connected, and they were rotating, not like those balloon arches do that people think are space worms or whatever.  This was steady as clockwork. It was like the hand of a clock going around but the hand was made of spheres.  It did this the entire time I was watching.  For a while they were roating vertically, then turned horizontal. Its movement appeared to me to not be subject to the wind.  It was steadily sailing to the east with no variation in direction.  At one point, I don't k! now if it was the light reflecting or my eyes, but they had a ! rainbowi sh glow on the edges.  The object or objects appeared white.  They did seem to be connected. I watched until it got too small to see.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779

UFOs at the Cumberland River Edge.;2015-07-16 22:00:00;5 hours;UFOs at the Cumberland River Edge. My friends and I sat at the edge of the Cumberland River and watched the stars above, and also looking at the skies (sic.  sky's) reflection in the water. No star had a reflection in the water but one.  I attempt to seek the star creating the reflection.  To my slight right on the opposite bank we were sitting, one of the stars begins to shift oddly in the sky and I immediately let my two friends know that one of the stars was not a star. We kinda freaked out a bit because its flight pattern was abnormal from what we generally are exposed to in the sky.  Plus we just learned something!  As it reached the near edge of the other side of the river, we got a decent look of the lights.  (Well, any view is a decent look.)  It was, oddly enough, the shape of a Mercedes Benz symbol minus the circle.  All I could explain it as is just three streaks of light coming from one point in the sky as it settles above the trees.  It sat there for a while, and then it just went up until it was out of our view.  After that, three more followed suite. All were the same shape. There was one of the same shape to our left higher than the others.  As time went by, it descended down and just stood still.  Felt like we were being monitored, but just slightly.  We kept a visual on it the minute we saw it.  It stayed with us the longest out of all. About 1:30, we see one of them descend behind the trees with its lights shining brighter and closer than before any of the others.  No more were seen afterwards.  The sky was quickly covered in clouds around 3:00.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779

Witnessed a black square hovering completely still in the sky on the northeast side of the ramp. It looked like a piece of the atmosphere had been punched out in a pitch black square shape. Birds flying near the object made it appear that it was about the same height in the sky. After online research I found a video of an object filmed in California by a man in March 2019 that looks exactly like what I saw.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779
