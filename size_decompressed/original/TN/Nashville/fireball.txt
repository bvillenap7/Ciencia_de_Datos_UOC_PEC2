Unusual Blue Light (Meteorite or Flare) 2 minutes observed traveling south to north.;1998-02-25 20:00:00;2 minutes;Unusual Blue Light (Meteorite or Flare) 2 minutes observed traveling south to north. East of Nashville at 20:00 hrs.CST on 25 Feb. 98 a bright blue large evening star appearing in shape and color meteorite or flare or ? traveled at the rate of a Jet airliner from south to north (unusual for meteorite). First observed at approx. overhead position and took two minutes to travel north then dimmed or burned out with no color change or breakup at approx. 10 degrees from northern horizon. Observation made by my wife and myself. I have 17 years affiliation with the Air Force and am a C-5A Galaxy Flight Engineer. We have both observed many falling stars and both agree this was unusual in its bright intensity and blue color and direction of travel from south to north. I am 100% certain about the charactoristics. Also I used an aircraft transitioning along the eastern horizon for speed comparison. This was not an aircraft we observed. Again either a Meteorite transitioning the atmosphere or a flare traveling from south to north.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779
fiery object looking like craft in movie it came from outer space or comet-like with fiery tail observed traveling in nw direction fr;1999-09-29 18:45:00;5 minutes;fiery object looking like craft in movie it came from outer space or comet-like with fiery tail observed traveling in nw direction from nashville, tn. it traveled in horizontal fashion at very high altitude approx same as airliner cruising altitude. seemed to move slowly but was probably very fast due to high altitude. observed 5 minutes till faded in distance. one object observed and appeared at first to be a fiery comet-like object-yellow-gold in color--object was totally immersed in the fire-not separated. it traveled at an angle from me so that i could observe the tail of the fire, but gradually became a circle of light as the distance increased from my position. i only observed the object travelling across 1/4 of the sky as i didn't see it until i happened to look up after leaving the post office. the best way to describe what the object actually looked like is to compare it favorably to the object that crashed in the movie it came from outer space or the objects in war of the worlds but the first movie is the closest. i must also state that the object never came down, but travelled horizontally the entire time observed. it appeared to move very slowly but was actually moving very fast. the great altitude was deceptive when judging speed. i am an insurance agent and a lifelong resident of nashville. i am 52 years old and have had three sightings in my life: 1st 1957--2nd 1987--3rd the current report.duration of sighting was 5 minutes.there was no contrail-just a small fiery tail.

While driving home I saw what at first I thought might be a shooting star glittering down from the heavens.  Upon reflection, I thought it might be falling 'space junk.' The object was 45 degrees above the horizon, just above the treetops.  The trail, from my perspective was a bit longer and closer to earth than the standard shooting stars I've seen.  The object entered green/orange and turned yellow-white.  The trail disintegrated/disappeared as quickly as it appeared. It was in the southern sky.

I was standing on my back porch staring at the sky because of how clear it was out, and I noticed a bright orange/red light in the sky moving ever so slightly.  It started moving in L shaped directions in short intervals. it looked like it was over near ashland city, over the mountains. it moved in sharp right angle turns until it went into some trees.  I tried to watch it more, but the tree line obscured my view. I ran over to my  brothers house to get my mother to see it, but she was on the phone and couldn't leave.  This lasted for about 30 minutes near my house. Ive been an avid sky watcher for years now, but this is the first report Ive made.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779

We saw what first looked like a hot air or weather balloon.  It appeared to be round in shape and almost looked like it was either a fireball or a flame inside the shape. It was of a orange/yellow color and appeared to be traveling Southwest to Northeast.  It was neither slow nor fast, but seemed to travel in a steady pace.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779

Orangish bright fireball low altitude flying through Nashville.;2013-02-14 19:15:00;5 minutes;Orangish bright fireball low altitude flying through Nashville My event is almost identical to the one described in October 2012 in Burns, TN.    I was driving in southeast Nashville towards Brentwood when I noticed a bright orange light at low altitude traveling northeast from southwest.  I am an avid sky watcher and have seen satellites, military jets, northern lights, and know the difference between planets and stars, natural phenomenon, etc.   My first thought was a helicopter, though the light was different and did not throw a beam nor where there any navigational lights.  It was orange and rough in appearance, not like a sharp, well-defined light.  It looked the same color as a sodium-burning street light.   I pulled over to observe.  It traveled in a straight path.  It was not a windy evening.  It made no sound and being at low altitude ( I would estimate 500-1,000 ft.) made no sound.  Flight path was straight.  I'm not quick with the camera/phone like kids are but wanted to observe.  It was heading towar! ds the Smyrna/Mt. Juliet area and I thought it interesting a couple other similar reports earlier in the year.   I keep running over this in my head and can't figure out what it was and I'm the first to think there is a logical explanation.  The Russian Meteor happened within 12 hours of this event.

Silent Saw 5 or 6 bright lights coming over the horizon relatively slowly.  They seemed to be in some kind of formation, but the formation changed as they proceeded.  Then, several more formations come over... all behind the previous ones.   I could see air traffic in the area as well, and the planes were quite a bit smaller.  The planes were all 737's and MD-80's, at that is what flies in/out of BNA.  The lights made no noise.     They either burned out after 2 minutes or so, or became invisible as the passed over head.    It was difficult to tell the altitude, but these lights were very bright, large, and not any kind of aircraft.  I thought maybe debris from something coming through the atmosphere.. but no tails were visible. I took two videos with my phone that turned out pretty good, though it's difficult to determine the true scale because it was so dark outside.  They are too large to e-mail though.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779

Sighting replicated two nights in a row in West Nashville.;2014-11-10 22:00:00;5 minutes;Sighting replicated two nights in a row in West Nashville. Profile of sighting(s):  Sighting 1-  11.09.14 2200  At approximately 11pm I was out on a run here in west Nashville.  My approximate location was at the highway 100 highway 70 split.  Upon looking down at the city scape, I noticed a light that seemed to cut the sky in half the way a spot light would if it were pointed directly up into the night sky.  The stream of light was faint due to the saturation of light coming off of the city and the almost full moon.  To give you an idea of my vantage point- the at&t building is facing my direction with this stream of light appearing to disect the building in half vertically.   I looked at this stream for perhaps a minute or so as I tried to discern if it was light coming off of another building (such as a hospital) and as I was doing so a globe appeared directly over the at&t building itself - or so it seemed.  The light was circular or globe like in shape and it emitted a red and orange pulsating light.  The light I saw was akin to tossing red and orange glow in the dark balls into a circular tumbler and then revolving the tumbler in a fashion similar to the way a drying machine might tumble clothing around.  The light I saw had an extremely unusual characteristic to it.  The light appeared to strobe, yet it was faint enough that I didn't get the impression I was on the dance floor or having a laser pointed at me.  The light lasted approximately 2 minutes and was 4-5 times the size of the at&t logo itself.   After a couple of minutes the intensity of the light decreased -as did the frequency of strobes.  The light then moved in a south/east path over the city and out towards Memphis if you were headed on I 40.  The velocity wasslow yet constant (similar to that of an airplane cruising at altitude)  with no apparent change in trajectory or pitch.  The light continued to move horizontally across my field of vision until it went behind a tree line and into the night.  No jet stream or sound observed. Sighting 2 -  11.10.14 2200  In an effort to gather some additional information about the sighting - I decided to head out at the same time and be at the same place as I originally saw the object.  I didn't think that I would be able to replicate my experience, but fortunately I was able to gather some extremely important observational data that may help in identifying what it is I originally saw.  Again at 2200 the night after my initial sighting I saw this object but this time it was different. At this point the object flew into my line of sight as if it came from Memphis into Nashville.  The object exhibited the same behavior as the object I saw last night during it's exiting phase. I saw it fly in a constant velocity and altitude as it did the night before. This time however - the object stopped in mid air just outside the city and hung there for approximately 30 seconds. Then it proceeded to head out the way it came without any sign that the object actually turned around mid flight.  Essentially it w! as like the object was attached to a tether (like that of a yo-yo approaching the ground- appearing to stop for a second- and then going right back towards it's initial point of entry into my vantage point)  The entire sighting lasted approximately 6 minutes.  2 min entry. 1 min stationary. 2min departure towards initial point of entry.  This is the third time that I have witnessed this object - earlier in the summer I saw the same thing as my inititial report above but I didn't record it on my phone.  I have footage from the Nov. 9 sighting but unfortunately I gave up my personal information in the video.  Que the X-files track!;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779
Two fireballs hovering over I-65  near the exit to the old Saturn Plant outside of columbia TN;2015-01-01 21:00:00;3 minutes;Two fireballs hovering over I-65  near the exit to the old Saturn Plant outside of columbia TN My son and I had been hunting today on some family land in middle Tennessee.  On our way home on I-65 around the exit that leads to the old Saturn plant, we saw two lights in the sky.  I have an Aerospace degree and make a living in technology and design which puts me in some interesting experiences.  I am naturally visual spatial and am usually very aware of my surroundings and notice a lot of details.   We drove for about 4 miles from the time that I first noticed the lights before finally stopping on the side of the interstate to watch them almost directly overhead.  At first the two lights were in close proximity to each other and seemed to rotate slowly at about a 20 degree angle from horizontal as we were initially driving along.  I say that it looked that way but of course from our vantage point in a moving vehicle it can look like rotation but not actually be that. the most interesting thing was what we saw when we came to a stop and rolled the windows down.  The two lights were at about 1000 feet altitude from our position.  We had an overcast sky with a ceiling of about 1200 to 1500 feet I guess without checking.   These two objects seemed from my vantage point to be about as large as a car each in size judging from the size of the light they were emitting. initially from the first view we had of them, they seemed to alternate between brighter and darker in the intensity of their light which initially led me to believe that they were two airplanes that were in a holding pattern waiting for their turn at final approach into Nashville airport.  I knew that air traffic control would not have placed two planes this close together so I figured that they must be much farther apart yet my vantage point just makes them look closer.  I also thought they were much farther away than they actually were.   As we pulled over and stopped the car, I could see that they were not airplanes, helicopters, drones, balloons, light from a ground source, etc.  We had about 30 seconds of clear visual from the time we stopped and tried to video to the time that the first object on the left phased out like turning off a light with a dimmer.   About 10 seconds later the second one on the right phased out the same way.  Now they did not fly into the clouds, they were below them.  The light they emitted was an orange glow like a torch.  I am familiar with most everything that flies and many FAA regs.  I also am able to use logic and reason to determine what I might be seeing.   All I know is that with my experience both educationally, professionally, and Spiritually, I was not able to determine what I saw but I am convinced that it was not something man made.  I have never seen anything like it before and am very aware of what it takes to make something fly and these two things did not match that knowledge.  They did not emit any sound that we were able to single out from the mild interstate traffic.  We would have heard a helicopter or possibly even a drone in my estimation.  Even if it had been something like! a drone then from the size it was, we would still have seen the object against the cloud ceiling via the ambient light emitted from the nearby urban infrastructure when the light it emitted phased out.   Again the light was a orange glow times two, fixed hovering in the sky about 1000 feet above the ground  with a constant fixed distance between the two.  The left one phased out first, then 5 to 10 seconds later, the second one phased out the same way leaving no trace or sound.   Again, I reiterate, I would know if they were airplanes, helicopters, drones, balloons, flairs, ground emitted light, etc and they were none of those.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779
