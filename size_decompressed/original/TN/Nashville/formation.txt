formation of 5-6 Ufos fly directly over Nashville.;2007-10-26 20:18:00;30 sec;formation of 5-6 Ufos fly directly over Nashville. Ufo sighting approx 815 pm cmt. Headed in a direction south south east approx 6 objects about magnitude 1.0 traveling in formation.  Objects appeared to be individual running in a straight line together.  there was 1 object that ran parallel to the other objects which traveled in a row object was traveling very fast.  seemed to come out of nowhere. observation lasted approx 25 -35 seconds.  the objects appreared and disappeared they were headed directly over nashville tennessee from my  home in the germantown area. which is north of town. objects did not leave any trails or have any noise associated. I have been an amature astronomer for many years and have seen lots of sattlites and airplanes at night but this was unique.  The objects were not very bright which makes me wonder if the light I saw was reflected off the objects , they were well placed to be immumitated by the city lights of nashville..The moon was also full or almost full..

Above is what I heard over a ham radio.;2013-06-25 12:00:00;1 hour;Above is what I heard over a ham radio. Peter, I could not find how to email you this info.   A farmer outside of Nashville found a deflated and semi deflated weather balloon attached to some items last month.  The balloons were attached to a triangle of small fibreglass rods about six feet on each leg.  Styrofoam balls about the size of footballs were attached to these rods.  About two balls on each leg of the triangle.  The bottom half of each styrofoam ball was covered in red and yellow LED lights.  About eight AA batteries were glued into each styrofoam ball.  This must be what some saw as orange orbs flying over at night.  Red and yellow LED's make orange light.   This report was heard by a ham radio operator.  The farmer is a ham radio operator.  Please excuse the other data, I did not know how to get this message to you via email so I filled out this form.;36.1396949002215;-86.7826550997779
