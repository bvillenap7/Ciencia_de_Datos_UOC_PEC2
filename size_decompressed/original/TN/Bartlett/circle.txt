Three bright green fluorescent orbs streak parallel across tree line...;2008-04-26 22:30:00;5 seconds;Three bright green fluorescent orbs streak parallel across tree line... On the quite evening of 4/26 between 10-11pm in Bartlett/Memphis, Tennessee, a friend and I witnessed what looked like a bright green fluorescent ‘roman candle’ streak horizontal some 160 feet parallel across a nearby 60 foot tree line for a period of 5 seconds, then disappeared.  Sitting on my patio facing due south a bright green fluorescent horizontal streak emerged from our left (east) traveling right (west) parallel to the ground at a slow speed greater the 40mph above a 60 foot tree line of pine trees some 50 yards away. Paradoxically, there was a Bartlett police car traveling the same direction on the back road behind my property. In a short matter of 5 seconds the green streak started as a single orb-like light source, and then changed to three green orb-like lights stacked in a vertical line before it disappeared.  There was no sound other than the road noise from the moving police car and no smoke trail one would expect from fireworks. The closeness with absence of airplane engine noise eliminated the source of a low flying airplane. This is my first possible sighting and I do not know what to make of it.

These objects were flying in a northwest to southeast direction.  One would appear travel the sky overhead and the next would travel the exact same path.  They made no noise.
