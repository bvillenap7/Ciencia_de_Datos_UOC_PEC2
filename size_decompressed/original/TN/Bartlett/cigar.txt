I could see the outline of the ship bend light around its long cigar shap like a big white bus but camo buy reflecting the night sky;2011-08-10 22:00:00;20 seconds;In Tn we have very tall oak trees 50 100+ high I normally and  reqularly have night walks after dinner with my dog .normally we would walk out of our apartment complex out onto an open field .Lined with these tall oak trees it was a great place to walk my dog and star gaze. I walk my dog all around and when she stops to sniff I would stop and look up .most of the time being a young man of 28, I would have the latest song playing on my ipod .Not having my ipod I was reluctant to stay any longer than I needed ,as I had nothing to entertain myself with .Half way across the field  my dog pauses to sniff a recent scent as she does often ,I then look up facing one end of the open field. It was a clear night sky as clear as can be a normal night sky .And as I said looking toward oneway I saw from one end of the tall oak tree line float silently across one end of the field to the other . I noticed it even though I think It tried not to get noticed  .It's description was as followed .It had some kind of light bending pannels all over it I looked at it and saw 5 lights small round linning the bottom .but again it was reflecting the night sky light all around it minus it's lights  one the bottom and I could see the outline of the ship bend light around its long cigar shap like a big white bus but camo buy reflecting the night sky .i viewed it for 20 seconds glide silently from tree line to tree line it was  real I smiled afterwards and thought to myself that I actually have just seen a SHIP.Craft.I do have more details im sorry im not a good writer.the actual size of the ship was 30 to 60 yards in length and maybe 10 ft wide the ship itself was only tree line di! stance to me So I didn't just see it it saw me it was so close;35.1841;-89.8588
