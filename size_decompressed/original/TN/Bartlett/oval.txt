Red lights , and Firey underneath.;2008-01-01 00:30:00;about 45 seconds;Red lights, and Firey underneath. I was exiting a friends house carrying some items to our car.  A light in the sky caught my eye, I looked and saw what apeared to be a oval/round object in the sky. The direction of travel was from west to east.  The object had red and white lights on edges but appeared to have what looked like a burning fire underneath. The craft made no noise. The elevation of the craft I would put above 15,000 ft. Very odd as it looked almost like it was burning. I went back in the house and told the rest, they came out and witnessed it too. I was not going to say anything about this until I heard about the ufo seen over Texas this past week. I have not believed reports about ufos until I witnessed this for myself.;35.1841;-89.8588
