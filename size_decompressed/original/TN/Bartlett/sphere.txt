On 9/19/06 at 05:40 the witness was walking in a residential neighborhood down North Star St. toward Jupiter Ave. in Bartlett, Tennessee, a suburb of Memphis.  It was a dark morning with a distinct backdrop of stars.  The only sounds noticed were of early morning traffic on nearby streets and interstate.   The witness glanced over his left shoulder with the appearance of an apparently nearby sky glow that lasted about two seconds.  The sky glow was followed by a soft pop and crackling sound.   About two seconds later, a bright orb appeared and moved at a very high velocity at an apparently low altitude without sound and virtually parallel to the ground, then disappeared from view in three seconds behind a tall tree line. ((NUFORC Note:   Witness is highly educated, and works as an academician.  He sounded quite reliable to us.  PD));35.1841;-89.8588
