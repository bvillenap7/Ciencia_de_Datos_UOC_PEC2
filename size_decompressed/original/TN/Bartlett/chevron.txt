V shaped ufo over Memphis.;2007-11-09 23:00:00;2 minute;V shaped ufo over Memphis. Some family had gotten together for a funeral two days later.   My uncle, brother, brothers girlfriend, friend T.J., and myself were on the back porch smoking.  I looked up into the night sky, and saw a V shaped object.   It was about a half a mile away and i first noticed it coming out from behind a tree that was blocking my sight line.   I watched it for about 5 seconds before I said,  what the hell is that!.   The four people with me just looked up and watched the V shaped craft fly right over our heads.   The craft made no sound at all, not even wind noise could be heard.  It had 6 or 7 white-yellowish lights.  Very sharp point to the V, and very slim body, just like the letter V.   About a week later we were in the same place, only three people were witness to that sighting.   Two sightings in a week, the same object!?  What's really going on here?;35.1841;-89.8588
