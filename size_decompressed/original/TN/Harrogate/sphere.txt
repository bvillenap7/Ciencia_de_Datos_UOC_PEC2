It wasn't moving, it stayed in the same location.  There were no lights on the object.  As I stared at it, I started to notice more in different areas of the sky, yet not too far away from the others.  None of them were moving, and they all looked the same.  I saw at least 7.  As I stared at them, they fades away and disappeared. I searched the sky but couldn't find any.  A few seconds later, they reappeared. Mostly in the same spots however there were some in different spots.  Still, never moving. They hovered there for another minute or 2 and faded away again, this time i didnt see them anymore.  I attempted to take a picture but the camera of my phone isn't very good.  A couple of things I noticed during this time was there were no birds flying while the objects were visible, as soon as they disappeared for the last and final time, birds befan to fly around again.
