Three bright white lights moving in unison in a triangular shape.;2020-10-01 20:05:00;3 minutes;Three bright white lights moving in unison in a triangular shape. I was driving down the interstate from Ewing, Virginia toward Cumberland Gap, TN.  I was checking the harvest moon every once in a while as I was driving when I noticed what I thought were 3 stars to the South.  I realized I had never seen 3 stars that bright so close together, I slowed almost to a complete stop on the interstate and realized the 3 lights were moving in unison.  I thought it could be a plane but there was no blinking light, there were just 3 white lights a little dimmer than the brightest star in the night sky.  I was able to confirm it wasn't a plane when one passed by the object in my field of view and had the characteristic red and white flashing lights.  The three triangular lights continued toward the horizon and my friend in the car noted how you could see a triangular outline connecting the dots.  We pulled off the interstate as it disappeared into the horizon.;36.5744;-83.6054
