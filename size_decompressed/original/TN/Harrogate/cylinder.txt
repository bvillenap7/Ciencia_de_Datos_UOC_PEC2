Metallic cylindrical ufo seen over Harrogate TN,  flying toward VA.;2020-11-21 07:00:00;3.5 min;Metallic cylindrical ufo seen over Harrogate TN,  flying toward VA. While driving west? on Highway 63 twards Speedwell TN, right in front of the Hy livesay Middle School,I happened to look up and notice a few white lights - which I thought were a plane of large size flying very low. It looked cylindrical and kinda disc shaped but it was early in the morning and still somewhat dark outside, so I figured as I drove closer to it, I would have noticed the wing shape and general appearance of a familiar aircraft like a jet. Approaching the craft closer, still while driving, the shape did not change and remained cylindrical and somewhat like a cigar with a bubble in the middle - kind of like a Tic Tac. It had three lights on the top that were white and none of them were flashing. It had a metallic hue to the surface and I almost wrecked my SUV staring at the craft as it hovered over the middle school and over the First Responders station. As there was no way photograph or video record it,  to my current sadness, due to road construction on the highway I followed the craft as best I could in my rearview mirror watching it disappear over the horizon headed towards Virginia. I have only told my husband as I do not wish ridicule on myself, and you. I am still in awe.;36.5744;-83.6054
