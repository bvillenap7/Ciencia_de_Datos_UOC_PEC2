The first object was sighted almost due south from my starting position.  It was a fairly solid light source, with another smaller light at the rear of the craft.  It was about an 1/8 to 1/10 the size of a full moon, and seemed to be fairly low, about 1000-1200 feet.  It was moving north by north west, at an average speed, compared to commercial planes in our area from the Nashville terminals.  This object was a solid light, though, so I was interested in it, and I took two or three camara shots of it.  When the object was nearly due East of my position, it seemed as if it grew or swelled in proportions.  It dimmed, and an object with running lights exactly like a plane shot out of it, the new object hovered in position to the East of the first object, then began moving to the West.  When I next looked to the first object(I was taking photos of the second object)it had reversed it's course, and was rapidly losing altitude.  At this point it nearly left a trail in the dark sky it moved so fast.  When it neared the ground, it began moving slower, and dimmed considerably once or twice before resolving(Don't ask me how, I didn't see this, it just happened between one moment and the next)into what looked like a larger object than it's original appearance, however this one had a cross of 4 small lights underneath, and red and blue lights, like a jumbo-jet that had it's landing lights on, but much dimmer.  I took a total of maybe 10 shots and, though I'm fairly handy with a camera, I'm by no means a pro.;36.3287;-86.9212
