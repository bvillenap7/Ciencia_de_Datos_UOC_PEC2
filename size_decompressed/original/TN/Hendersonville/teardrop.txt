Very smooth, not erratic.  Almost looked missile like, no sparks or trail, very large.   We both waited for a crash or explosion, but there was nothing.   Had something sticking out slightly of both sides, looked to short to be wings. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
