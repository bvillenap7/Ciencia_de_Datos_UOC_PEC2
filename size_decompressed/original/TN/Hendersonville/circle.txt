Circular dot hovering daily.;2012-06-19 00:00:00;lasts several seconds;Circular dot hovering daily. Around the clock circle dots flying alone but near others,that speed up a few seconds,stop,then take off in a circular or zig zag direction.  Can see with naked eye.  They sometimes can be seen through thin clouds. I live 10 miles from Airport.  But these things don't land, just repetitive. Their path is not exact but close.  Their altitude seems high, but can track em, then they go away and return continuously taking a slightly different path each day or night.;36.306294736842;-86.6104999999999
BRIGHT ORANGE GLOWING ROUND OBJECT PULSATING IN SKY MOVING ALONG THEN STOOD STATIONARY;2012-09-30 07:15:00;20 minutes;BRIGHT ORANGE GLOWING ROUND OBJECT PULSATING IN SKY MOVING ALONG THEN STOOD STATIONARY THEN DISSAPEARED AFTER IT MOVED ALONG AGAIN One Orange Glowing Round Object going across the Sky which was Pulsating in and out and was in View from the Backyard Patio Deck for about 20 minutes.  As it continued to move along pulsating it slowly shrank down in size.  Then it just completely Stopping in the Air and stayed Still in the same Location for about 7 Minutes as it was being viewed with no movement because one could see the Tree Branches to compare it with my Eyes to see if it was Moving.  If it was going across it would become out of view by the Tree Branches.  It was still in View just staying stationary.   Then the Orange Pulsating Round Object began moving again and slowly Shrank down in Size and disappeared out of site completely.  In other words it Vanished.  There was no signs of any other Aircraft in the Air at the time which was surprising considering the Nashville Airport has Airplanes going in and out all hours of the day which here in Hendersonville many Fly near the House and make t! urns.  There was Nothing in the Sky other than the Round Orange Pulsating object.  The only thing I noticed while standing on the Deck was one of the Neighbors Dogs was Barking and Barking.  Other then that there seemed to be no one around outdoors to see the object in the area which was surprising.    Have no idea what it was other than to say it looked rather ODD considering it was BRIGHT ORANGE and ROUND just PULSATING that is what threw me off because normally the Airplanes in the Area ARE NOT ORANGE GLOWING at all.  This Object was different. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is flawed.  We suspect that the witness intended a date of September 30, but he enters September 31st, which is not possible.
