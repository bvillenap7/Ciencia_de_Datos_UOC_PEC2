Triangle shape seen in Hendersonville in 95;1995-04-07 17:00:00;10 minutes;Triangle shape seen in Hendersonville in 95 I was returning home from doing some shopping  in Gallatin, Tennessee, with my then young son taking a nap in the back seat, and was travelling towards Hendersonville on the Vietnam Veteran's Boulevard bypass, planning on getting off at the New Shackle Island Road exit. At the exit prior to the one I was going to take, some lights to my right attracted my attention.  Higher in the sky, one could see the usual collection of airplanes that were on approach towards the Nashville Airport that is several miles on the other side of Old Hickory Lake, but these particular lights were moving slowly, were very low, a dull red in color, and were losing altitude. I didn't think much about it as I continued on towards my exit, but noticed that the lights continued to drop even lower and moved slower over the top of the suburban homes that lay to the right of the bypass.  Becoming concerned, thinking that perhaps an airplane was in trouble, and at the time being a Certified Nurse Technician, I slowed down and kept checking on these lights as I finally reached my exit, thinking that I might have to grab my phone and dial 911 if there was a plane crash. As I exited on New Shackle Island Road, the lights were now coming right towards me, as I exited to the right, and at this point, I realized that this was not an airplane. I pulled off onto the shoulder of the road and got out of my car, my son still asleep in the back seat, and I was absolutely overwhelmed by what I saw. It was triangular in shape on the bottom, with a dull red light at each corner on the bottom, and one in the center.  I had the sensation of a huge mass, that it was very large, more of a pyramid in shape, and that there was a sort of grid that lined it, rather reminiscent of a rocket gantry, some sort of support structure. It was totally black, so black, in fact, that it seemed to absorb light, giving off no reflection of any kind. There was no sound from this craft, no engine sound, no whine of turbines, nothing.  But I could feel an extremely low level vibration and hum as it approached. It seemed to be just drifting at this point, right over my head, so close that I would swear it seemed I could have thrown a rock at it and hit it. I stood there for several minutes as this thing went right over my head, then it headed slowly down the bypass, and suddenly just completely disappeared.  I got in my car, did a Uturn across the street, trying to see it, but it was gone.  And during this whole time, no traffic passed, which was a fact that didn't register with me until I was headed towards Springfield on the back roads. It felt as though somehow time itself had stood still as this craft passed overhead. If anyone else saw this craft, I would be very interested in hearing about it. I did not report it at the time, because I frankly did not know who to turn to, without being laughed at or not taken seriously, but with the increasing number of reports that sound so much like what I saw, I decided to go ahead and report it. This did not have the appearance of being terrestrial in nature, and I would gladly submit to hypnosis if needed to verify this report and perhaps dig out other details that I may have forgotten. I am that positive of what I experienced.;36.306294736842;-86.6104999999999
BRIGHT LIGHTS IN TRIANGLE SHAPE OVER HOuse;2011-01-17 22:45:00;2 minutes;BRIGHT LIGHTS IN TRIANGLE SHAPE OVER HOUSE I was laying in my Bed, as I saw a bright light coming from outside.  I looked out the window and saw what looked very odd to me.  I got my friend that was with me to look and her reaction was Aliens.   I ran out side to get a better look. It was indeed different.  It had very bright lights, and moved very fast. It went straight towards the house and then curved towards Nahville.  Then disappeard.;36.306294736842;-86.6104999999999
Pulsating Triangle of Lights;2013-08-06 21:00:00;15;Pulsating Triangle of Lights Me and my boyfriend were on our way home from Kroger.  The sky was totally clear.  We were driving on the back road when we saw some sort of lights in the sky that were really bright.  When we got to the interstate we could clearly see a triangle of 3 bright lights pulsing in the sky above us.  The color of the lights were white but when they started pulsing they turned a little red.  We pulled over to watch them as they slowly started moving back and forth and then just vanished.;36.306294736842;-86.6104999999999
