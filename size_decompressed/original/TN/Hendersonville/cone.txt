I looked over my left shoulder and saw a huge fireball(approx. the diameter of half of a school bus. It was yellow and orange and never lost intensity the entire sighting.  It was pushing a coneish shape.  We could see the outline clearly but inside the outline was blackish-grey. It flew slowly over my neighbor's house aprox. 500 feet high and 400 feet away from us.  It maintained same heighth for 4-5 minutes traveling into a heat lightning storm in the NorthEast.  It made absolutely no noise and no fire debris or jet stream was visible from fireball.  My son also witnessed it for approx. 2 minutes.  He took a video on cell phone and I took 1 picture.  When we went to view, niether were there. Gallery was empty and not even a poor quality picture or video......nothing.  It was so close I could have hit it with a bullet. Never believed but now have no choice.  Most incredible!!;36.306294736842;-86.6104999999999
