Ring with long arms and crown viewed in sumner county TN;2008-04-08 06:00:00;2 min;Ring with long arms and crown viewed in sumner county TN I was on my way to work to nashville, When I stopped at the stop sign at indian lake rd I noticed somthing out the top of my window, This thing looked to be about 200 ft off the ground just sitting still it was round ring with three very long arms that came to a point, It also had what looked like a crown or lots of pointy rods going all around the top of the circle,there were no light or bright colors it just looked gray or silver white.If I had to put a size on it I would say the circle was about 40 to 50 ft across the arms looked about a hundred feet long some shorter than the others and the crown on top looked to be 40 to 50 ft tall I may be wrong but it looked very large. I decided to get out of the car to takr a better look, I thought it had to be some kind of baloon for advertising or somthing when I got out it started moving not in a motion like a plane but up and down in the same place, then it rotated and just bliked out like you turned out a light. I have never seen anything like this before and am quite disturbed, I hope it is somthing military or some kind of projected image.;36.306294736842;-86.6104999999999
Unknown Object Around Powerlines;2009-04-25 03:20:00;1-2min;Unknown Object Around Powerlines I was going home from my weekly poker game with my buddies when I saw a weird greenish light beside me near the street lights I slowed down to look thinking it was a transformer going bad. What I saw is going to be hard to believe it is for me, I stoped and got out of the car its a good neighborhood well lit with street lights so I could see good. This thing was moving around the powerlines and street lights it was about the size of a trash can top but did not look like one it had a ring center looked like a donut with spikes coming out of the sides and thin looking wires coming out of the top all around the ring. I watched it for it seemed like a 1min or so and then it rotated in one place  really close to the power lines flashed really bright like a welder and was gone no where to be seen.I did not here any noise at all even when it flashed. I looked for it again all the way home but never seen it again. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.  PD));36.306294736842;-86.6104999999999

We both stood there and looked out the blinds up in the sky at an object hovering over the same spot with very bright lights.  Then a second bright light appeared at a different location on the flying object for about 10 seconds and then went off.  We were trying to figure out if it was a large drone or what as it was too low to be a star and it was just sitting there in the sky with no noise and not moving.   We live on a hill with unobstructed views so it was pretty easy to spot the bright object.  I know the military base likes to travel down towards our area to run tests a lot so maybe it was something they were testing.  It was strange.  I was creeped out so I shut the blinds tight and left the bathroom light on.  We did not sleep much afterwards.;36.306294736842;-86.6104999999999
