Objects over Hendersonville, TN;2007-10-28 16:05:00;20 minutes;Objects over Hendersonville, TN The silver objects were moving north to south. They were in a loose formation and some overtook others. There was no engine noise. While observing, a 4 engine jet flew from west to east above them and produced a contrail.   When the objects got inline with the sun they were still silver in color.  They continued south until I lost them in the sun and tree line.;36.306294736842;-86.6104999999999
