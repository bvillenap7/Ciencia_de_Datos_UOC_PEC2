We thought we saw a plane flying nearby, but upon closer inspection it took the shape of an oval. There were two neon lines going around the craft - one blue, one green - and the craft seemed to almost shrink before slowly guiding itself away from our sight. Needless to say we were very paranoid the rest of the way there, all the while talking about ways we could debunk it, but ultimately couldn't. It was 9PM by now and I had to walk back home. Then, I saw it again. It was lower to the ground this time and seemed to be swaying dramatically. The lines however were not there this time, but it had three rotating square neon lights around it. After seeing it, I hurried home and shut all window blinds and locked the doors.;36.306294736842;-86.6104999999999
