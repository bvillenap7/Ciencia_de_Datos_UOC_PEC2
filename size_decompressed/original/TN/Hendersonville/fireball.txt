Four fireballs seen in the night sky;2013-09-01 22:15:00;15 minutes;Four fireballs seen in the night sky My Niece and I were sitting outside facing west when a huge ball of light came from the west traveling east.  We first saw it coming from behind the trees, so it was flying relatively low and at a moderate speed.  The color was orange and then the color changed to yellow then white.   As it was changing colors the fireball seemed to get smaller and smaller until it just dissappeared.  We had not had a chance to catch our breathe yet when another made an appearance.  Same exact thing. Exactly the same.  It came from the same direction, same speed, color and dissappeared just the same.   Just a moment after the second a third came and this is when the neighbors heard us outside and joined in the observance of the sky.  I placed the call the UFO hotline at this point.  We thought that was it but no more than a few seconds after i got off the phone the fourth came and we were able to video tape it and we had other witnesses for the fourth.  These things had no sound and once we could see them the entire duration was maybe 20-30 seconds each.  I've seen many strange things in the sky before but this one was extraordinary.;36.306294736842;-86.6104999999999
