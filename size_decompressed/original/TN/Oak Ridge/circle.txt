Strange lights in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of the star, Sirius.  PD));2016-09-21 23:37:00;2 hours;Strange lights in Oak Ridge Tennessee I went outside and witnessed a star blinking in the north east direction from my front porch.  Once my eyes focused i noticed it was not just blinking, it was also changing colors.  I watched it and took pictures then a thirteen second video of it.  When i pulled my phone from my sight i noticed another object with the same lights moving away from the hovering object.  I moved to the back yard to follow the unknown object and when i looked around i saw two more at different dirsctional points in the sky hovering like the first.  The one moving left my sight all together but the one in front of my house still remains but has moved more east.  I later watched e video zoomed in and saw an object changing to several forms.  Like light caught in a crystal. I later took screen shots while the video played, showing the object in red solid circle.  The a blueish green triangular shape and then a white circle that look similar to a smoke ring.  At 01:35 I am still watching the object and the neighborhood dogs are going crazy.
