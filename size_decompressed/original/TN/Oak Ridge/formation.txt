Lighting Formation over Clinch River in Oak Ridge, TN;2008-05-29 22:10:00;15 min;Lighting Formation over Clinch River in Oak Ridge, TN Driving home from our job at about 10pm, we saw a group of lights in the formation of a V hovering over the water moving slowly up the river. We continued to drive along the road which follows the river until the river turned the bend and was gone. I have pitures on my cell phone and my friend has video capabilty on her cell phone and took an ongoing video. We are at a loss to explain what the lights were. I do not know of any airplane or airborn vehicle that could hover and move that slow at a consistant speed, this vehicle was about 50 ft off the surface of the river.;36.013;-84.2624
