Dark sphere hanging in the sky just before sunset.;2002-06-05 19:30:00;30 minutes;Dark sphere hanging in the sky just before sunsut It was the first week in June 2002 about an hour before sunset. I was taking my usual brisk walk along the hilly perimeter of my neighborhood, and as is normal for me slowed my pace down to a slow stroll as I reached the overlook of the the city center. Normally I slow to get a larger view of the clouds, hills, trees, buildings and roads, and except for the variation of clouds all is usual. But on this particular evening I spotted a small dark object that seemed to be floating above the the city about 1.5 miles away. I had seen this object or one like it, near where I worked in Rio Rancho, NM two years earlier. It appeared to be the same dark sphere maybe 10-20 ft in diameter, and floating around 200 ft above the ground. It had the same characteristics as before of slowly drifting left, right, up and down, but on a horizontal and vertical plane, and not in an arc which would suggest it was tied to string or rope. I watched it for 30 mins or so in its near stationary position, but as the sun began to set I noticed the object was getting smaller and smaller, and believed that it was now moving further away from me in a northern direction. Finally it was so small I could no longer see it in the dim light of dusk. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));36.013;-84.2624
