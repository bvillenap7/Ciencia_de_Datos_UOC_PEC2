Bright, green, light also white in color possible fireball flew over house and across street about 20ft above trees approximately 10:02pm.  It was completely dark outside.  Disappeared out of sight once on other side of tree sight.   Not enormous in size, but rather large.  Hard to determine size really.  It was a ball.  Kinda oval and circular.  There was no sound at all.  No jet trails or streams.  Lasted about 4 seconds.  It glided smooth and went across and over the trees.   About 5-10 minutes later there were numerous jets with lights on both wings flying low going towards direction.   Also, numberous helicopters. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and she stated that the apparent size of the object  was larger than that of a full Moon, and perhaps several times larger.  Her impression was that it was not a meteor, contrary to local news reports.   PD));36.013;-84.2624
