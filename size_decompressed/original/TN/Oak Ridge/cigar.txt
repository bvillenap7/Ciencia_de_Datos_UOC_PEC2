I commented to my wife, Hey a UFO just teasing of course as I assumed it was a plan.  I continue to watch the craft as it move slowly across the sky.  The shape was cigar possibly disc.  Notibly with a white color not metallic.  Not totally convenience of what type of craft I contined to watch until it change direction of 180 degrees without slowing or speeding.  It was no turn, almost as if it bounced off a wall.  The craft intially was head West to East now was heading East to West at no change of speed.  I watched it until out of sight.;36.013;-84.2624
