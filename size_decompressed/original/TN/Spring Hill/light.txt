These lights were fuzzy edged like headlights seen through a fog. One light came out of the circle monentarily, and then returned to its orginal position. One observer thought the lights had a greenish tint however 2 other observers thought the lights were white. These 3 observers were in 3 different locations. This sighting took place during the beginnings of an electrical storm. Lightning and thunder and wind were present. Moments prior to the rain beginning the lights began to move away in a southerly direction becoming gradually less distinct more distant until invisible.;35.7163;-86.9092999999999
I saw a very bright orangish colored light traveling very fast over Spring Hill.;2006-08-16 20:49:00;1-2 seconds;I saw a very bright orangish colored light traveling very fast over Spring Hill. I was standing on my front porch on 8-14-06 watching some lightning flash off in the distance. When all of a sudden I saw a bright white/orangish light that appeared to be coming from a north westerly direction at a high rate of speed.In the blink of an eye it vanished.I initally thought it was ball lightning due to the lightning storm that was taking place farther north of my location.My thought at the time was cool I just saw my first ball lightning. Tonight on 8-16-06 at about 8:49pm I was again standing on my front porch smoking and just happened to look up and saw the same light! It was very bright and white/orangish looking. This time however it was almost straight overhead and again appeared to be traveling very fast and was visible for about 2 seconds when it blinked out. I've seen many things in the night sky including airplanes, satellites,ISS, meteorites, fireballs and comets but this light looked different and did not appear to resemble any of those things. *I am wondering if anyone else in the Spring Hill,Tn area has seen anything like this?;35.7163;-86.9092999999999
5 lights moving at a high speed with no apparent order but naked to the eye;2009-02-11 21:00:00;90 Minutes;5 lights moving at a high speed with no apparent order but naked to the eye There were about 5 moving lights hovering over Spring Hill,  The speed of each of them ruled out anything man made.  They danced in the sky with no symetry but were very clear to the naked eye.;35.7163;-86.9092999999999

Traveling light to the south viewed from middle Tennessee near Nashville.;2013-12-10 17:00:00;1 hour;Traveling light to the south viewed from middle Tennessee near Nashville At approximately 17:00 CST, I saw a light in the sky toward the south.  The light was high in the air but lower than the outermost atmosphere.  It was not a star. It was moving, though too slowly to be a rocket or a plane.  As I was trying to figure out what it was, a jet coming from the south flew by the light so quickly that I thought for a split second that the light had fired a rocket.  It was a jet though, as I could tell from the condensation trail. It appeared to be some aircraft running reconnaissance on the unidentified light in the sky.  That means it was low enough for manned aircraft to pay attention to it.  I went back to my house after walking my dog as the night sky grew darker.  As I got closer to my front door, I realized the light was traveling in a northerly direction from the south.  It ended up in a position southwest of my house, and my neighbor drove up as he came home from work. I told him to look at the light in sky and tell me if I am seein! g things. He asked the same question I did, what is that?  We both looked at it for several minutes then went indoors.  I texted my other neighbor and told him to look outside to see if he could tell me what he saw.  He and his wife both saw the light and remarked on how strange it was. It was there for an hour or more.  I left to go inside and was unable to track it any longer. When I had a free chance I went outside again to see if it was still there, but it was gone.  I took a 6 minute video with my phone of the light as I viewed it from my back porch.;35.7163;-86.9092999999999
