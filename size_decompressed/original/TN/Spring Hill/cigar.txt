Object captured in photos;2012-08-31 21:03:00;10 seconds;Object captured in photos August 31st was the night of the so called Blue Moon. I have recently purchased a new camera and was on my deck taking pictures of the blue moon.  I was experimenting with different settings and using a remote control.  I must have taken 500 plus pictures that night. Around 2300 I decided to call it a night and come inside.  It was starting to get cloudy and they were calling for rain. I got out my laptop and started taking a look at some of the pictures.  I was deleting the ones that were blurry or too dark or too small. I ran across a sequence of pictures that had the moon with an object that was producing a contrail. I thought I got a picture of an airplane or something.  I did not recall seeing a plane in the sky that night and the Nashville airport was landing planes from the north.  The object I captured in the photos appeared to be traveling west to east although it is hard to say. The moon was in the south eastern sky that night.  I know the report states a! period of 10 seconds. That is because I did not see it but that is the time stamps on the pictures.  In most of the pictures you can see the contrail and when you enlarge the object it is a long cigar shape object.  I have had several friends look at it and no one seems to know what it might be.;35.7163;-86.9092999999999
