Two orange fireball-type flying craft within 5 minutes of each other.;2014-02-01 18:00:00;5 minutes;Two orange fireball-type flying craft within 5 minutes of each other Clear night at a few minutes after 6 pm, about 50 degrees outside.  My husband called me outside, where he had been grilling, to see an orange fire-ball looking light flying low in the sky heading southwest.  It slowly flew in a descending line, then paused and flew upward for a bit before continuing south and then disappeared behind the houses.  Ran to the front yard, but it was nowhere to be seen.  I didn’t hear any sound from it. Five minutes later, my husband called me and the kids back outside to the backyard.  Another orange light was flying in the same direction, but at a slightly lower altitude. This one seemed smaller and made more turns than the first.  It also flew behind the houses, but when we ran to the front, it was visible flying south for a few seconds before turning and heading in a westerly direction and then it just disappeared. We were not sure if it was the same craft that circled around without us seeing it (my husband was watching the sky the whole time after losing sight of the first one) or if it was a second craft.   We’ve never seen anything like it.;35.7163;-86.9092999999999
