12 Crescent Shaped Crafts Flying Over Spring Hill, TN.;2015-05-23 02:50:00;20 minutes;12 Crescent Shaped Crafts Flying Over Spring Hill, TN. At approximately 2:50pm, sitting on my porch looking NE I saw a white object sitting stationary about 30° above the horizon. I immediately noticed a few more and became highly curious.  There were more and more over the next few minutes so I grabbed my telescope to get a closer look.  There were about 12 objects total floating within about 15° of each other.  They were all clearly the same design, definitely not natural, but looked like nothing I’ve ever seen. I am a four year Air Force veteran and have been obsessed with flight my whole life and these were nothing I’ve ever seen before.  The finish was white and highly reflective.  They were crescent shaped with sharp points on opposite ends and what appeared to be a disc shaped center.  Over the next approximately 10 minutes, one of the objects, clearly larger than the others, moved directly north of my location and rapidly descended, disappearing behind my neighbor’s house.  My wife grabbed out camera and we captured them as best as we could with the equipment, a Nikon D60 with a stock lens.  They slowly disappeared to the NE and at about 3:10pm one was spotted directly east, flying very quickly, level with the horizon from north to south.  There were at least two commercial aircraft flying in the vicinity and provided a clear distinction that these were not typical aircraft. The pictures don’t do what we saw justice.  The view through the telescope was up close and personal.;35.7163;-86.9092999999999
4 objects with red lights in their centers in a kite-like formation seen in Spring Hill TN;2016-01-02 21:30:00;2 minutes;4 objects with red lights in their centers in a kite-like formation seen in Spring Hill TN I was driving through the parking lot of my apartment complex, headed home, and I was on the phone, driving slowly.  I looked up and saw lights in the sky directly in front of my vehicle.  There were four objects, three in a perfect triangle formation, and the fourth was like a tail, the whole thing looked like a kite.   I got off the phone and turned on my camera video and drove to keep up with it, filming it out the window as I drove.  I took three videos.   It moved silently, quickly.  Each object had red lights in the middle of the vehicle.  I couldn't tell what each individual object was shaped like as I was driving and filming.   It moved over the top of my building and then the objects in the triangle formation just disappeared.  When the fourth object got to that same spot, it disappeared.;35.7163;-86.9092999999999
