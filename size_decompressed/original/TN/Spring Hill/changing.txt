Bright white light in the sky.  Spring Hill TN.  Sometimes changes shapes & Blinking colors Red Green & Yellow.;2009-02-08 18:00:00;3 Hours;Bright white light in the sky.  Spring Hill TN.  Sometimes changes shapes & Blinking colors Red Green & Yellow. Every night from February 1st, 2009 through tonight (February 8th, 2009) I would see a very bright (star like light in the sky) looking southwest. Using binoculars the object seems bright like a star but moves indiscriminately. It’s round and looks like there is an energy of light around it like a sphere of moving energy.  It seems like the shape distorts and it’s revolving. It’s out every night and visible to the eye.  It looks like the brightest star in the sky but it moves and changes locations. It is visible at dusk (around 6:30pm) then descends below the tree lines by around 8:30pm CST. Green, Red & Yellow lights will blink & go off right before it descends below the tree line.
