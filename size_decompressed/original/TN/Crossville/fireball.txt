Object orange with multiple lights appearing to not be moving and/or moving toward or away from us;2006-11-25 18:15:00;2 min;Object orange with multiple lights appearing to not be moving and/or moving toward or away from us My brother And I were out star-gazing and saw an object low to the horrizon south of our location { LAT:35.77350 , LONGT:85.21630 WEST } that appeared to be a long distance away. Maybe 20 to 30 miles. It was orange in color , round in shape and appeared to have multiple individual lights. It was either stationary or was moving toward or away from us. Seconds after I adjusted my boniculars on it , it just went out like turning off a switch. We monitored its last location for several minutes but it did not reappear.;35.9547515463918;-85.0442484536083
