more pulsing red lights in the night sky;2000-10-02 17:00:00;two hours;more pulsing red lights in the night sky my 9 yr. old daughter saw them first, she was outside on the front porch she called me outside to the porch, i then wittnessed with her 3 flashing circular objects. i then called for my husband whom was on the phone with our son. our son at the present is at the south end of the county 25 miles away, my husband then told our son of our discovery and our son was watching too. one of the objects went due north at a slow speed then stopped momentarily above the treeline, the other 2 objects were circleling like a ring around the rosie game type manuver. then the 2 circleling started traveling away from one another. we then wittnessed 5 more objects traveling in different directions, 3 of which lined up in a row, straight up and down and staying in that posistion, the object in the middle of the row of three traveled a distance away toward the south. the other two objects travel away and towards the original area of these object sightings as of right now they are still out there flashing and blink and as these objects are looking or searching for something. my husband believes there may be other living things in space, i believe something if i see it. my daughter of course at age nine is curious and facinated by these sightings, our son is somewhat like my husband. we are very well educated people, but reside in a small town. this isn't the first sighting we have wittenessed, however this is our first time reporting a sighting to you. our sightings before we have reported to local police and radio, but i don't think we were taken seriously. there is definately something unidentified beaming around out there and i get a real uneasy feeling when i see these objects.i can't explain that, but i can assure you, that i am a believer at this point. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the witness at some length, and we found her to be quite convincing in her description of the objects.  She had the presence of mind to call another witness at a different location and have that individual go outside and look.  That person reportedly saw the objects, as well.

Large green circular orb with coinciding power outage.;2007-10-03 23:32:00;7 minutes;Large green circular orb with coinciding power outage. UFO Sighting  On October 3, 2007 at approximately 11:32 P.M. in Crossville, Tennessee our power went out at our Peavine Road home. My son and his girlfriend observed a large green soundless circular orb in the sky that moved slowly over the city then faded away. A friend of theirs across town called and reported seeing the same phenomenon that also coincided with a power outage at his location. The power was out about 45 seconds. There was some chatter today on local radio about this sighting.  This is no hoax. Although some logical explanation may exist, my son can think of none that match his current scope of knowledge. He is 22 years of age and he and I are both skeptical yet fascinated by the possibility of visitors.  He informed me that this was the real deal and an incredible sighting of a very large craft. If you are interested in his first hand account or can provide us with an explanation, I’ll put you in touch with him. I have yet to get details from him yet because he was headed to work and pressed for time.  He nor I seek any fortune or fame nor attention but are willing to help an investigation, in the interest of an explanation. Unfortunately, I can only attest to the power outage, but you can bet I’ll be running like hell outside if the power flickers tonight. I am sure there are many that could provide details and I simply wanted to let you know, in case you wanted to talk to eyewitnesses in our city. Maybe somebody got a picture.;35.9547515463918;-85.0442484536083

I went through my house and out the front door, walked up the street and watched them move toward town.  They were not really high because I had to wait for them to come out of the trees to see them. There was no sound.  My husband and I are in our late 60's and his mother is 90, we are retired and enjoy a quiet lifestyle in Tennessee.  This is the first time any of us has seen anything unusual like this in the sky.   I called the local sheriff's department right after we saw these lights and reported what we had seen.   We called the small local airport on Monday and they did not even have anyone at the airport Sunday night and knew nothing about the lights.   We would love to know what these lights were and if anyone else saw them.;35.9547515463918;-85.0442484536083
