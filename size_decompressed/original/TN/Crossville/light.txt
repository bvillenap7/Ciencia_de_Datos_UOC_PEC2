It all lasted about 60 seconds.;35.9547515463918;-85.0442484536083
Bright light going west to east over eastern Tennessee.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of the ISS?  PD));2013-06-03 21:00:00;3-5 minutes;Bright light going west to east over eastern Tennessee I was on my front porch with two small children watching lightening bugs when what we thought was plane flew over.  The light was very large which made it seem as though it was flying low, however, there was no sound, no trail and no blinking lights.  It traveled west to east and passed nearly directly overhead. It traveled the full arc of the sky over us.  It was in the sky for at least 3-5 minutes and was bright enough to be seen even through some light scattered clouds.  It was visible much longer than usual for aircraft we see, and Iâ€™ve seen a Galaxy land.  This light was brighter. This did not seem like an airplane at all.;35.9547515463918;-85.0442484536083
