large craft that moved 1-5 miles a hr. for 15 to 25 mins over the nashville area;2005-02-05 01:00:00;15-25;large craft that moved 1-5 miles a hr. for 15 to 25 mins over the nashville area on the 5 of feb 2005 about 1:00 am there was a wierd faint sound very hard to describe, like a turbine or like when a transformer humms when it explodes but on a verry large scale the noise could be heard traveling from nashville going south as it got closer it sounded as if there was a giant craft like a 500 foot blimp or something it was very slow moving maybe 1-4 miles per hour. and sounded just very long and wide hovering craft over our heads just above the overcast cloulds it was a very dark and low covering cloulds that took up the whole sky.  if i had to guess the size it would be 150 to 200 foot wide and 250 to 300 foot long,and  hoveared about 250 to 400 feet from the ground.me and my whole family heard the noise and went out to try to figure out what it was and we all where boggled.  2 days later about 2:25 am about 200 dogs in a 360 degree of about 2 miles and the farm next door i heared a cow moo as if it was disturbed but did not see any thing it was a very strange feeling in the air like electricity or something this went on for about 10 to 12 minutes.  we have heard the noise a total of 3 times if i get a sound recording would you be intrested in it? i will not leave any info beacusse of big brother ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

Circle of rotating red lights hovering over the trees.;2015-05-01 20:30:00;30 seconds;Circle of rotating red lights hovering over the trees. Around 8:30pm, I was driving toward Providence from MJ road, when I saw something in the sky.  Hovering about a quarter of the way from the moon to the ground, so pretty high up.  At least 3-5 red lights.   It wasn't moving or getting closer or further away and the lights didn't blink like a plane, but faded in and out one by one in a rotating circle or triangle.  Lost sight of it after 30 seconds for about 10 seconds and it had vanished. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));36.1868;-86.5066999999999
