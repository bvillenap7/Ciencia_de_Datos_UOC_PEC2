I was driving down an old country road and at first saw a flying object that I thought was a plane. I thought to myself that it was flying awfully low to be a plane and began to slow down while simultaneously muting my car stereo. When I slowed down the plane slowed down and I began to think that the aircraft resembled a drone more than a plane so I stopped completely so I could get a better look at the aircraft. When I stopped the aircraft stopped. It was around 100 feet from me and probably around 50 feet in the air. (It was hovering over a horse farm pasture). I quickly realized that this was not a drone nor was it an airplane. I stared straight at an aircraft that's shape could best be described as a symmetrical cross laid horizontally. It had dots of light that were more warm white on the bottom and orange and blue-ish purple on the top. The blue-ish purple lights were in the middle and the orange were more on the wings/str! etch of the cross. I quickly drove off because the encounter frightened me and I looked back a few seconds later and the aircraft was gone. The aircraft was too big to be a drone but too small to be a plane.;36.1868;-86.5066999999999
