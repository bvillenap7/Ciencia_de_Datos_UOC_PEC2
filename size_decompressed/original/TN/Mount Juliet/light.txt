red light go fast, white light means it stopped and pulse fast red before moving.;2001-04-15 22:30:00;over 70 minutes;red light go fast, white light means it stopped and pulse fast red before moving. At approx. 2230 hrs 15Apr01 while outside smoking a cigarette, and observing the solar system, I noticed a red dot (approx. the same light magnitude as the North Star) moving from west to east (just left of where Jupiter was setting.) I thought that it was a satellite, rocket booster, or other misc. space junk crossing the sky, and continued to watch it as I have done in the past (I enjoy looking at the night sky and have 2 astronomy telescopes for viewing objects.) This is the strange part, the item made an instant course change and now headed due north (all directions are from my point of view). It then stopped at approx. were Auriga was. Let me say this also, everytime the item stopped moving, it would appear to be white, then before moving would start pulsing red, while moving it would remain red. All movements appeared to have instant top speed to instant stop, except for a few times were it would start at what I would estimate half speed. It then moved east and stopped to my north easterly position (around approx. the middle of draco.) Then stopped and went south, then it stopped again to my east south east position (between Bootes and Virgo.) Then it went westward, and stopped to my south (just below Leo) then make a few zig zag moves westward stopping between each movement and ending this near cancer. It then went north again, this Northward, Eastward, Southward, Westward movement, continued for at least 80 minutes (although it was now throwing in some go one direction and then go back  halfway). I watched this item also do an extremely fast and extremely tight circle (approx. the size of my fingernail at arms length) in the sky at which time it left like what appeared to be a fast evaporating contrail, (only the circle shape had the contrail). I continued to what until approx. 2350 hours. At which time I lost it over the horizon to the East.;36.1868;-86.5066999999999
large red lights hovered above dark field, then in the sky looked like star w/red-twinkling lights, saw space-ship  thru binoculars;2002-09-07 20:30:00;5 seconds;large red lights hovered above dark field, then in the sky looked like star w/red-twinkling lights, saw space-ship  thru binoculars Saturday 9/7/02 at 8:30pm.. I was driving with my 9 year-old daughter, down a dark country road (Chandler Road) in Mt. Juliet, TN (near Nashville).   We saw some large red lights (about the length of a school bus) hovering above the trees over a field.  We were unable to see the body of the craft because it was so dark.  I spotted it for about 5 seconds before I drove on past it.  Then it had ascended high into the sky extremely fast according to my daughter. My daughter had kept her eye on it the entire time until we got to her dad's house about 10 minutes later. (I was unable to because I was driving).  When we arrived she pointed it out to me.  To the naked eye it looked like a very bright star but red lights were twinkling.  We showed it to her dad also.  Through binoculars I saw a space ship.  It was a grey craft with a roundish-octagon shaped flat bottom with flashing red lights, and a domed top.. it was floating/hovering in the same general area for about 1 hour.  Her dad video taped it but he didn't have a tripod and the zoom is not as high-powered as the binoculars but he will submit it for your evaluation of it.;36.1868;-86.5066999999999
Bright red lights appeared one right after the other as if in a line moving slowly. One of the lights break line and shoots up at speed;2011-11-01 23:00:00;5-6 minutes;Bright red lights appeared one right after the other as if in a line moving slowly.  One of the lights break line and shoots up at speeds much faster than any known aircraft could go. within about 30 seconds of this all lights instantly went out. Judging from ground at night, lights appeared to be roughly twice the height of a normal aircraft and much larger.;36.1868;-86.5066999999999
Bright white light moving slowly across sky with NO flashing lights.;2012-09-09 20:30:00;2 minutes;Bright white light moving slowly across sky with NO flashing lights. Bright white light moving slowly across sky from east to Northwest. No flashing lights.  Clear night.  Told husband that I thought the Space Station was going over and he needed to come see. Since we have seen the space station numerous times, he wasn't interested.   I shut the door and continued to follow the light and then it quickly zoomed out of sight and disappeared.  So quickly that it almost didn't even seem to move.  It was just there moving and then it was gone.  I did notice several plane lights in the general vicinity WAY up in the sky.  Some moving toward the light and some moving away.;36.1868;-86.5066999999999

4 lights moving in unison at a high rate of speed with no sound.;2019-02-24 20:25:00;4 seconds;4 lights moving in unison at a high rate of speed with no sound. On Feb. 24th, 2019 at about 8:25 PM CST I stepped out to the back patio for a smoke.  I sat down and was looking at the stars which I hadn't seen in awhile due to all the rain we've had.  I noticed 4 amber lights moving as fast as a shooting star across the sky.  They were spaced evenly between them, did not make any sound, and were heading northwest in direction.  I did not have enough time to retrieve my cell phone and it probably wouldn't have captured it.  Within 4 seconds, the lights had traveled out of sight.  I would say they were below 2,500 ft altitude.  I live in a townhome complex and there are single story units behind mine looking west.  The lights appeared over me, and were past the roofline of the other townhomes in the 4 seconds before being out of view.  I live close to the Nashville airport and there were plenty of aircraft visible at the time.;36.1868;-86.5066999999999
