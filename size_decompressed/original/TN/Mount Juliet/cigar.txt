As I was driving, I look to my left and saw a object just sitting in the sky,  It was brown in color and its shape was a long thin cylinder with what appeared to be windows down the length of the side.   It was stationary, but then it shot off to the EastÂ  (same direction I was traveling) and flew in to a cloud and did not come out the other side which did not make since because at the rate it was traveling it should have appeared on the other side of the cloud in about 3 second after entering.   I watched the cloud for some time, until it became impossible for me to turn my head back in that direction any longer.   The event only lasted around 8 to 10 seconds.;36.1868;-86.5066999999999
