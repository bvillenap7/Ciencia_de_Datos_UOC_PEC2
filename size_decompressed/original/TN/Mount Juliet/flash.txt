((HOAX??))  Flashing lights travelling fast across the sky.;2016-03-28 21:05:00;3 minutes;Flashing lights travelling fast across the sky. Three flashing lights started out together.  They were red and green flashing very quickly.  One of the craft split apart and went across the sky above us very quickly.  The other two stayed behind for a bit.   Then they followed the trail of the first, but were too close together and travelled too fast to be planes.  All were completely silent.
