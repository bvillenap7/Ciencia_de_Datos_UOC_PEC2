I saw two cylinder shaped objects in what appeared to be close formation. They were moving across the sky to the southwest. The sun had just gone below the horizon and the objects seemed to be reflecting sunlight. I'm not sure of their altitude but it must have been at least ten thousand feet for them to still be reflecting sunlight. My first thought was that they were large military aircraft flying in formation, but as they passed overhead the trailing object seemed to break formation and continue in a more southerly direction. They moved fairly quickly and made no noise.;36.1868;-86.5066999999999
