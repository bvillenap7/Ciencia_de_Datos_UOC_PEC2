Very large bright round object in sky over Mt. Juliet.;2015-08-04 04:30:00;10 minutes;Very large bright round object in sky over Mt. Juliet. This morning at 4:30 from my window at back porch near Beckwith Road off I-40 east...  I clearly  observed a brightly  illuminated, round object near I-40, hovering still at approx 1000-2000 high…  Watching and using the frame of my roof i saw it still.  Thinking it a weather balloon, since I was looking in the direction of our weather station, towards Langford Cove… Decided to leave, and as I started to close blind, it began going slowly straight up...lights pulsating.  Looked like the lights on the globe at NY Times Square...all perfect.  It went up and beyond my advantage from roofline. Looking for other reports.  Surely the traffic on I-40 heading west would have been able to observe on such a clear morning.;36.1868;-86.5066999999999
Red pulsating, round, small, silent UFO observed twice above very tall tree.;2016-05-29 21:00:00;2-3 minutes;Red pulsating, round, small, silent UFO observed twice above very tall tree. About 10–20 feet above very tall tree (approximately 80 – 100 feet tall), saw bright red, round, light.  Appeared as though it may be pulsating.  It wasn't very large.  I don't know exact size.  I sort of felt in shock, couldn't wrap my head around what I was seeing.  My husband had just gone inside to take shower.  I ran in the house, hollering it's a UFO, come see!  I briefly thought about grabbing my phone to take picture.  But, I didn't want to take my eyes off the object.  And I wasn't sure if you could tell much about the object anyway. Absolutely no sound.  Hovered above tree for approximately 2–3 minutes, then began to travel straight up.  Then it completely disappeared.  I did not see it travel up, down, right or left.  Just disappeared.  Then approximately 2–3 minutes later, it returned.  It hovered above same tree for 20 – 30 seconds & then disappeared.  My husband did not hear me & by the time he finished shower & came outside it was already gone. I felt like I was being observed. Probably not connected, but about 30 minutes later, my husband and I heard strange sounds coming from same general location (on the ground of course).  We have a wooded area right next to us & it sort of sounded like an animal walking in the woods.  But, we sit out on our patio all the time & have heard just about every sound & can identify typical sounds.  This sounded weird/different.  Because when it’s a deer, or other animal, you can hear it moving & sound moves/travels with the animal.  This sound seemed to stay in one location.  I don’t really know how to describe the sound, but it kind of sounded like someone/something going around in a circle in one area. We have neighbors behind us, but no lights were on, no flashlight appeared.  We tried to rule out every possibility.;36.1868;-86.5066999999999
