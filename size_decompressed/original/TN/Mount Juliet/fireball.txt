There was a bright orange light flying through the air fairly slow.  It slowed and hovered over our house for about a minute.  It then started to ascend straight up and eventually disappeared in the sky.  It was like a small orange fireball with rays coming out of it and two beams of light shining out of it like spotlights.  I have never seen anything like this before.  It had no shadow of a craft or vehicle like a plane or helicopter.  It wasn't a satellite or falling star.  It moved with purpose, hovered and went straight up.;36.1868;-86.5066999999999
