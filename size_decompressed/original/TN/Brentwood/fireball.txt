10-30 orange fireballs over Brentwood, TN.;2011-07-30 22:00:00;10 Minutes;10-30 orange fireballs over Brentwood, TN. On July 30th, at around ten p.m, my little brother had called me to tell me to grab my camera and come outside to film these 30 orange fireballs in the sky.  This is where I automatically believed what he was seeing because he is always very skeptical about UFO's.   As I grabbed my camera we got in his car and drove for a minute and immediately I had seen up to ten orange lights hovering in the distant sky.   They were located behind the WSM tower which has red lights blinking on it.  You could easily distinguish these fireballs from the tower lights or any airplanes.  They did not move and they were not stars (it was cloudy).   These looked like the same fireballs I had seen on July 4th that moved in formation from Nashville all the way south past Brentwood.  On the 4th, I had witnessed these lights with my parents and a few friends.  These made no noise and were not Chinese fire lanterns (they would have burned out the distance that these lights traveled).   Anyways, I tried to get video of the lights over Brentwood on the 30th, but my video camera is terrible at night and I was unable to capture anything.   I thought my brother, his friends, and myself were the only ones who saw the lights on the 30th, but I was wrong.  Yesterday a newspaper article mentioned something about the UFO's on the 30th, and today they say they may have pictures.  I have told people about what I saw and of course people shoot it down, but I have no reason to lie about it.   My brother, his friends, and myself are students who go to very credible universities.  Brentwood is a community full of lawyers and doctors.  If there are more witnesses besides myself and friends, it will be very credible.   I have seen different types of UFO's in my life and consider myself lucky to see such a thing.  I am writing this because there have been a string of sightings in this area over the past two months and I am just curious to see what everyone else has seen or heard.

Green teardrop light falling fr the sky 11/19/15;2015-11-19 21:45:00;5 seconds;Green teardrop light falling fr the sky 11/19/15 I was driving home when I noticed a big and bright light, lime green on the outside but white on the inside, falling downward towards the sky.  It was in a shape of a teardrop, and it looked as if it was a meteorite (the ones you see in a movie) about to hit Earth. One would assume it was apart of a firework but there weren't sparks around the falling light or any cracking noise like usual. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.
