Silver, silent cigar flew extremely slow for 2 minutes.;2012-08-15 19:35:00;2 minutes;Silver, silent cigar flew extremely slow for 2 minutes.   Live near airport so extremely used to SEEING and HEARING airplanes.  This was NOT an airplane. It flew about the same height as an airplane for approximately 2 minutes.  The craft however flew far too slowly to, in my opinion achieve lift as we understand the properties and physics of flight.  It also made zero, absolutely zero sound.  It was very plain to see that it was silver metallic and had no wings, this further hinders achiving lift, I would suppose. I watched in awe for about 2 minutes until it went out of sight.  I immediately saw and heard later military aircraft in pursuit. I never thought I would get to see a UFO, and I finally did. It is a profound experience that I fully realize I have not yet come close to analyze and let it sink in. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
