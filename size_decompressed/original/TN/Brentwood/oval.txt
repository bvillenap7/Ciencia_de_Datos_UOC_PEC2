Oval Shaped object sighted playing golf around 12:45PM, Brentwood, TN;2008-02-09 12:45:00;5 Seconds;Oval Shaped object sighted playing golf around 12:45PM, Brentwood, TN While playing golf today in Brentwood, TN, off of Moores Lanes, just south of Nashville, I witnessed an oval shaped object in the sky. From arms lengths it was about 1 1/2 inches long. The estimated distance from me to the object was 1 1/2 to 2 miles away at an altitude of about two thousand feet. the object was stationary in the sky. The wind was blowing about 10 MPH. I was looking in a westerly direction walking down the 7th Fairway of 18 holes of golf I played today. The sky was perfectly clear...no clouds. Nothing else in the area of the sky where I was looking, not even birds. It was a dark silver or puter color, and there was no reflection from the object even though there was plenty of sunshine. The duration of the sighting was about 5 seconds, then it just wasn't there anymore.;36.0072465116279;-86.7871488372091
Two large oval orbs (joined by a third) emitting a bright orange/white glow and very low in the sky over Brentwood, TN.;2014-05-26 21:10:00;5 minutes;Two large oval orbs (joined by a third) emitting a bright orange/white glow and very low in the sky over Brentwood TN.    At times the orbs did not move and then they would proceed slowly west to east.  I first noticed the orbs directly over Nolensville Road and when I pulled over they were continuing to move eastward.  They were very low, making no noise, and moving vertically and horizontally in maneuvers not possible by conventional aircraft.   They were eventually joined by a third orb that came out of thin air and then all of them shot upward and disappeared quickly.   This experience left me feeling uneasy for the rest of the evening..
