V-shaped formation with cylinder like structures.;2014-07-05 22:00:00;15 minutes;V-shaped formation with cylinder like structures I took this video last night at 9:52 P.M. from our front yard.  I apologize for the initial movement, I was attempting to turn my cell phone to the right position.  There was so much occurring, that it was difficult to get the right filming position.  There were anywhere from 15 to 20 spaceships involved in this sighting.  The only way to describe their size was to say that from where I was standing, their height from top to bottom was half the length of the moon.  Their colors would change from bright orange to white and then to a vibrant red.   When they appeared red, I could see a tall, vertical and massive cylinder-like structure and a bright white V to the right side.  Their movement patterns would begin in a formation, change positions from side to side, hover and then become smaller and vanish.  If you look closely at the top and very bottom of the line-up you will see the first ship disappear before your eyes and another one appear at the bottom. The green flashes of light across the screen are fireflies.   Due to the firefly interference and the incredible occurrence before me, I decided to finally stop filming.;36.0072465116279;-86.7871488372091
