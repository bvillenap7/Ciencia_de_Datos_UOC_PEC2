changing bright orb;1997-02-10 18:00:00;2 minutes;changing bright orb Ok, i was getting out of my car at around seven to go to my cub scout meeting.  This was quite a few years ago, but it has been burned into my memory.  When I got out of the car, I saw a large bright light, like an orb. It was stationary, hovering over one of the many hillls.  It was about the size of the sun. It shrunk smaller, and then got the original size agian.  It then proceeded to rapidly sink in the horizon till it was behind the hill.  I was positive that it was not an airplane or helicopter.  It was TOO big to be one.  This is not a joke, i know that it happened. ((NUFORC Note:  Source is anonymous.
