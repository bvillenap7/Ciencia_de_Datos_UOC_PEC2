Extremely bright white cylinder looking object east to west direction saw from horizon to horizon through trees;1997-07-03 03:00:00;6 seconds;Summary : Extremely bright white cylinder looking object east to west direction saw from horizon to horizon through trees I was getting out of my hot tub, and had closed the cover at 0:300 hours on 07/03/97, looked up and saw extremely bright white cylinder traveling at a hight rate of speed. It was traveling in a very slight south east to north west direction..I own a compass. I first saw the object at the far southeast horizon through the trees. It was flying extremely low and seemed to pass over the subdivision I live in. I heard no noise what so ever. The best way to describe the size is if you hold a regluar size pencil at arms length, then it would be about that size looking at it from a distance. Called the local police to see if any strange thing had been reported. They said no. Called the airport control tower at Nashville, Tn (Brentwood is next to Nashville and I live about three miles from the Davidson (Nashville) county line. Talked to a controller, he said the only thing they had was a life flight helicopter coming in from the north. I made a official report with the controller. My! house is in a very quiet neighbor hood. Planes can be seen on approach patterns from various view points from my house. Some far some fairly close. Hot air ballons and civilian and military helicopters sometimes pass over the neighbor hood. In talking about this sighting with different people, I found that others had seen similiar lights between 22:00 and 23:00 on 06/27/97. Two people were witnesses This sighting was reported as very high and seeing only the bright white cylinder shape.The speed was reported as faster than an airplane at the same height.  The same object was seen at a lower altitude by three women at 02:00 hours on 06/28/97, about 7 miles distance from the 06/27/97 sighting. The speed was reported as being extremely fast.;36.0072465116279;-86.7871488372091
