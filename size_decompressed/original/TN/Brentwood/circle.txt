Orange flickering, slow moving, circular flying object.;2014-01-01 00:00:00;10 minutes;Orange flickering, slow moving, circular flying object. Myself and four others witnessed an orange, low flying, silent object at midnight New Years Eve.   We were lighting fireworks.  the object was heading due North and did not divert from its straight flight path.....going slow.   glowing orb was flickering and was identical to the event i reported 2/14/13.   I was amazed i witnessed this again and as a result I believe it could be a hoax or drone activity.   i caught both video and picture and it sounds a lot like the light reported in Clarksville, TN, on the same evening.  Weather was clear and calm. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));36.0072465116279;-86.7871488372091
