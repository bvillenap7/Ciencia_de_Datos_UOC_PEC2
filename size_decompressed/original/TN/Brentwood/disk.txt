Saucer shaped craft,that faded in out of view 3 times.;2000-01-10 09:15:00;4 minutes;Saucer shaped craft,that faded in out of view 3 times. I had just turned off of Granny White Pike onto Murray Lane (four lnae road),in Brentwood, TN. For some reason I looked left over the Brentwood Middle School, and saw an object flying approx. 1/2 of a mile away and at an altitude of about 500 feet. For 1/4 of a mile I had a totally unobstructed view of this object until the road became divided by a tree line, though I could still see the object through the tree limbs. The tree line ended about 200 yards from where Murray Road ends into franklin Road, and I had another unobstructed view of the object. The object appeared to be keeping pace with the speed of my car. The object then faded out and I could see it no more. After turning left onto Franklin Road I looked left, then right and saw the object again. It appeared to be flying once again at the exact same distance and altitude. Again I had a totally unobstructed view of this object as it now flew over a farm field. Again the object faded from my view, then about 3 seconds later reappeared. I watched this object for another 10 to 15 seconds, until this object faded from view for the last time. Again I noticed it seemed to keep pace with my car. The object had no wings, was a silver pewter in color,and I could hear no noise emanating from the object. There also seemed to be an aura or hazzy like disturbance in the air around the craft each time it faded from view.;36.0072465116279;-86.7871488372091
