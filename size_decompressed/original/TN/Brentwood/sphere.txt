Across the street of Franklin;2006-02-10 14:00:00;2 MIN;I was at a Waffle House in Brentwood T.N. on the corner of Old Hickory B.L.V.D. and Franklin Pike Circle. Across the street of Franklin Pike Circle is a Target convience store. At this location, I saw a black ball floating in the air. The object was bigger than a softball but smaller than a basketball. I wathed the object for 7 to 8 seconds. The object then began to move slowly in a westernly direction upwards for at least 3 to 4 minutes until it was completely out of sight. I don't know why, but I have seen objects like this 3 times over the period of 32 years. Two were at night and they glowed this one was during the day and it was black. After I saw this object, there was a small Cessna-like airplane in the area. I think (but not sure) it belonged to the Civil Air Patrol.;36.0072465116279;-86.7871488372091
