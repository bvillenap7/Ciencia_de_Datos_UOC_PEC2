Three cigar shapes objects in the sky.;2014-11-20 14:30:00;3 minutes;Three cigar shapes objects in the sky. As myself and two other coworkers were driving home today we saw 3 cigar shaped objects in the sky.  I was on the phone with my mother, which wanted pictures.  I pulled over on the side of the road and took two pictures of the three cigar shaped objects.   I got back in the car and started to drive down the road to get a better picture.   About a minute and a half down the road the three objects disappeared into thin air as if they weren't ever there.
