Six brilliant red and orange fireballs moving slowly and disappearing one at a time.;2013-09-28 20:30:00;5 minutes;Six brilliant red and orange fireballs moving slowly and disappearing one at a time. At approximately 8:30 pm. est. time, near Dayton, Tennessee I witnessed three bright fireballs in the northeast heaven.  They appeared in a straight verticle line at first and then moved slowly to form a triangle and then once again a straight vertical line.  The first two fireballs then slowly disappeared and only one remained for about one minute.  I witnessed the first part of this sighting by myself and then the last one with a family member.  At approximately 9:00 the fireballs reappeared in the same location northeast of Sale Creek, Tennessee and quickly became extremely bright while hovering together. At first there were three and then the fourth, fifth and sixth fireball appeared consecutively.  They did not form a line but moved to create odd shapes.  Then they slowly disappeared one at a time only to leave the last fireball lingering for about a full minute alone.  This last fireball behaved similar to the last one at 8:30 pm before it disappeared.  This second sighting was witnessed by four family members.  I am aware that there is a military flight training base about eight miles northwest of Fall Creek Falls in the Crossville, Tennessee area.  But these sightings to my knowledge have never appeared before.  These objects were brilliant red/orange in color and had an apperance of being on fire. They moved fluently but in no particular pattern consistently.;35.3875;-85.1024
