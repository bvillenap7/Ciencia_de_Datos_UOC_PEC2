I was looking up in the sky when traveling due North I saw a bright light traveling at an extremely high speed. I watched it for  about 15 to 20 seconds and it disappeared from sight. I thought at first it was an airplane, but it was traveling too fast at the height it seemed to be. I heard absolutely no noise associated with jet aircraft,(I used to be a jet aircraft mechanic so I know what to listen for when you see one.) This is not the first time I have seen things unexplained in the air. I need to be contacted about this soon. I work with the ((public agency)) so I not about to report a hoax!! Thanks for your time.
