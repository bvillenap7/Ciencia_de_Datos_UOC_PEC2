Thats a bright light;2007-03-24 23:00:00;3sec;Thats a bright light Alright the other night me and my girlfriend and 2 more of my friends were sitting around a camp fire my friends a cop and he pulled his cop car up and was playing with the spot light shining it on my hill and everything for a good 20min just goofing off. We have been there all night and we were getting ready to leave and we left to go home to my mom and dads just 50 yards from where we were. we pulled up walked on the porch My girlfriend said would you go back and get something out of the truck and then I said why w/e alright and when I turned around there was a light come out of the sky it looked like a doughnut cause the center was black but everything was so bright  and man it blinded me it was like somebody shined a spotlight in your face so I was like what is that I thought my buddy was sitting out in the road with his cop car shining that light on me then I look back I couldn’t stair at the thing I looked at the ground it was so bright the green grass look grey the light was like looking at the sun then it just went away and I said baby did you see that she was like see what and I said great that sucks I no I’m not going crazy so started telling her what I seen we both was freak out and I don’t ever do that then my buddy called that’s the cop he just lives right up the road he said man don’t think I’m crazy or nothing and I stopped him and said you seen it to he said yes from where I was on my porch I thought it went over my uncles tree line which is about 200yards or a little more from my parents house my buddy said it was probably 8 or 9 hundred yards in front of him he said to him it looked kind of white with a green tint to it. But he said man that was pretty big what ever it was he said it just went on around over the tree line and that’s all he seen. Man I don’t no what it was but I would like to no cause I never in my life seen anything like this.;36.553;-85.4904
