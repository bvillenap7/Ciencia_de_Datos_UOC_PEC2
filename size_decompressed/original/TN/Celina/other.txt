5 neon glowing objects appeared to have arms.;2014-06-16 20:00:00;15 seconds;5 neon glowing objects appeared to have arms. On a long stretch of mountainous highway where cell service is lost, my 27 year old daughter spotted a blue light moving toward us in the sky.  It was a glowing, neon type light.  As we drove, it seemed to be very low in the sky and moving very slowly.  As we passed under it, we could see very clearly 5 different colored, neon glowing, straight arms, all connecting at a center point (red, blue, white, yellow...and green I think).   There was a neon hue surrounding the 5 arms which created a circular shape, but the object had only 5 arms connecting only at the center.  That was it.  It moved over us and disappeared.   I have looked all over the internet for anything close to an explanation.  I can't find anything, so I am reporting it here.
