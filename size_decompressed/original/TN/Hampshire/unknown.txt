Object hovering for over an hour that had very bright multi colored lights.  ((anonymous report));2017-12-13 21:00:00;2 hours;Object hovering for over an hour that had very bright multi colored lights On December 13, 2017 we were went outside to observe the meteor shower that was taking place over the skies of Lewis County Tennessee.  We observed what appeared to be a aircraft of some kind hovering off in the distance which appeared to be above commercial aircraft which were traveling in the general vicinity.  Through binoculars and cellphone camera, the object in question appeared to be triangular at one point having white lights in corners however, the multi colored lights seemed to dominate the overall object most of the time.   This object remained positioned in the sky for more than an hour before eventually disappearing.  Obviously sometimes objects traveling directly toward us or away from us can appear to in a static position when the whole time they are getting closer or further from us.  We would believe this to be true in most cases however, no time did the objects mass seem to change e.g as an object gets closer generally it would appear larger as ! it comes into view.   We can not declare for certain what we saw however, we can say that the object that we saw didn’t perform like any aircraft we’re accustomed to seeing.
