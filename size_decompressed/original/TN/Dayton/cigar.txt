Was traveling east on highway 60 right outside of town.  Something caught my eye to my left.  I, at first, thought it could be a shooting star, but it was bright green and cigar-shaped.   It was going straight the seemed to veer off course.  It was very unusual not shall of light like a star would be. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS--TEXT OF ORIGINAL REPORT)) Saw a cigar shaped, bright green light streak across the sky and veer from a straight path. Was traveling east on highway 60 right outside the city limits. I caught a glance of something I thought could be a shooting star but as I looked closer, it was bright green and cigar shaped not shall of light.  It also seemed to veer off a straight course, not like a star.  It also had a strong tail of the same color. It was very unusual. ()(END ADDENDUM)) ((ADDENDUM #2)) It was close so it appeared bigger than a star or planet in the night sky but not as big as a  full moon, I would say the size of a crescent moon would be my guess ((END ADDENDUM));35.5019;-85.0173
