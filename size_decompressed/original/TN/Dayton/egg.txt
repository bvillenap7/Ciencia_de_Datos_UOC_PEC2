Green object flies over Dayton, TN. in 1994;1994-04-15 14:30:00;7 seconds;Green object flies over Dayton, TN. in 1994 It was a clear crisp afternoon, low humidity and blue sky with high thin clouds.  Ceiling was visible to above 15000 feet.  The object appeared out of the sky from the West over the mountains at about 8000 feet, and was bright greenish in color - moving east and downward at a 35 degree angle, approximately at 500+ mph (as if it was slowing), lowering altitude to approximately 2000 feet, then it changed trajectory and angle and move upward, heading northeast, increasing speed to approximately 2000+ miles per hour.   The event was witnessed on HWY 27 northbound near the overpass at the park in Dayton, TN.  Several cars stopped and a few people - including myself and my girlfriend, and other unknown motorists exited their vehicles.  We all looked at each other afterwards in disbelief of what we had just observed.  The object never made a sound - which was weird considering the elevation and speed.  I was 19 at the time.   Since then, I went on to serve as an M1-A1 Main Battle Tank Armor Crewmember, Air & Missile Defense Officer, Military Intelligence Officer, and as a Counterintelligence (CI) Special Agent - retiring as a Captain, after serving the first part of my career as an enlisted Soldier.;35.5019;-85.0173
