RECTANGLE MIMICED NIGHT SKY & STARS SEEN DURING YR. OF COMET PASSING NEAR EARTH;2001-09-12 02:00:00;11 sec.;RECTANGLE MIMICED NIGHT SKY & STARS SEEN DURING YR. OF COMET PASSING NEAR EARTH FIRST OF ALL I HAVE ONLY SHARED THIS ONLY WITH 2 PEOPLE THE NEXT DAY AND FROM THE LOOKS THEY GAVE ME I NEVER TOLD ANOTHER SOUL. IT HAPPEN THE YEAR WE HAD THAT MEATOR SHOWER FROM A COMET THAT PRODUCED SEVERAL NIGHTS OF ENJOYMENT OF SHOOTING STARS.  I WAS STANDING IN THE LOT NEXT TO OUR HOME ENJOYING THE MULTI FALLING STARS AND SEEING HOW MANY I COULD COUNT. WHILE SCANING THE SKY WITH MY NAKED EYES SOMETHING COUGHT MY EYE IN THE NORTH EASTERN SKY MOVING MY DIRECTION. IT LOOKED LIKE A GROUP OF MOVING STARS.  AS IT APPROCHED MY LOCATION THE STAR PATTERN WAS IN THE SHAPE OF A RECTANGLE WITH STAR LIKE OBJECTS FILLING IN THE SPACES OF THE OBJECT  AS IT PASSED DIRECTLY OVER HEAD IT WAS ONLY APPOX. 20 TO 50 FEET ABOVE TREE TOPS. IT WAS HUGE!  AT THAT POINT I COULD TELL THAT THE STARS WERE LIGHTS ON THE DARK RECTANGLE THAT BORDERED THE EDGES AND FILLED THE CENTER.  AS IT FLEW OVER ME THE NIGHT SKY ABOVE WAS REPLACED WITH THIS LOOK A LIKE NIGHT SKY  AS IT CONTINUED OVER HEAD SOUTH WESTWARD I STOOD WAITING FOR THE AFTER SOUNDS OF ENGINE NOISES THAT NEVER CAME. THERE WAS NEVER NONE IT WAS NO SOUND OTHER THAN THE CRICKETS IN THE GRASS WITH ME  PLEASE IF ANYONE KNOWS IF WE USA HAVE THIS TYPE OF AIRCRAFT THAT IS SOUNDLESS AND CAN MIMIC THE NIGHT SKY, I CAN DISMISS THIS FROM MY MIND AS A UFO.
