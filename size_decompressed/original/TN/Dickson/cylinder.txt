The object was tubed shaped,silver coler,almost seethrough.It looked like the size of a tour bus.Itwas mabey a mile away,one half mile up. I saw ridges from top to bottom.It moved like a slow snake.But in no direction.There was a jet in the distance,a few clouds in the sky. The car behind me honked it's horn,i looked down at the stop light and crossed the intersection stopping on the other side,but i could not see it anymore.;36.0758;-87.4
