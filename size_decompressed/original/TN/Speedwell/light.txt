I estimate the height at 35,000 feet at around 500 MPH.  My wife came outside and when I told her what I saw she thought I was crazy.  We spent 20 minutes observing the sky when another object was spotted by both of us moving directly south at about the same speed and altitude.  The object was about as bright as a normal star, pure white with no blinking lights.  After 5 seconds of observation it turned very bright (as bright as the full moon, if not brighter) before dimming slowing for 10-15 seconds then disappearing. Both of these phenomenon were followed by a red streak following the objects that was very fast.  Each of these events happened approximately 1 minute after the object disappeared. Neither of us can explain what could of caused this very unusual event that we observed and are both very shocked by the event.;36.4795;-83.8181
