Bright flashing red, blue, green, and yellow lights from hovering craft near Lebanon TN;2012-09-08 21:30:00;0:00;Bright flashing red, blue, green, and yellow lights from hovering craft near Lebanon TN Object was seen hovering and moving around in a circular motion over Lebanon TN area and then moved North toward Hartsville area where it hovered for a few hours.  It was flashing green, yellow, red, and blue lights.  Not sure what shape the object is.  It is definitely flashing very bright red, blue, green, and pretty sure yellow lights and just hovering.  Every so often it will circle a little or move back and forth and then just hover.  Moved from Lebanon area, North toward Hartsville but further past that area.  Possibly edge of Ky. Have a telescope on the object but unable to make it out other than very fast flashing red, blue, green, and looks like yellow lights that seem to be going in a circle.;36.2043689581094;-86.2975129967762
