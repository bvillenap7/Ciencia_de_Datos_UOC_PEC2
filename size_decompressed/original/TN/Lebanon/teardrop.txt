blue lights on bottom of fast moving silent object;2007-08-22 20:08:00;10 secs;blue lights on bottom of fast moving silent object Aug.22, 2007 8:11PM  Following is an exact transcription from my daily journal. 8:11 PM. Okay I know I’m not crazy but what I saw tonight at 8:08 PM is pretty scary if you think about it. I was standing outside looking to the SW sky hoping to catch a glimpse of the Space Station. Time for this was supposed to be around 9:00 PM CST. I saw this light moving in the sky and then it made a very sharp right turn and headed straight over the house. I’d like to know if any air traffic controller at Lebanon’s airport noticed this anomaly. Sounds astounding huh?  But I swear on mom and dad’s grave that what I saw was very real. Note: I drew in 2 dimension what this all looked like and it is still in my journal. It was of a teardrop shape with the lights (bluish in color) along the lower body panel and were all the way around it. From the point where the light was moving from my left to right was maybe a distance of around 2 miles away from me. When that light turned at the very sharp right angle it came over my home as silent as if it had no engines at all but took less than 10 seconds to reach my home.  No sound at all!!  The lights I did see when it went over my head were very florescent blue.;36.2043689581094;-86.2975129967762
