Red/orange colored objects flying in formation (constellation pattern) over Lebanon, TN.;2009-10-03 21:43:00;12 minutes;Red/orange colored objects flying in formation (constellation pattern) over Lebanon, TN. Multiple objects, at least 50, flew in formation near my home in Lebanon, TN. The objects were absolutelyÂ silent. The weather was clear and ground level winds reported at zero MPH. The objects approached from the west and curved to the north before disappearing into the night. The objects   near the end seemed to speed up as if they were trying to catch up with the main formation. From a distance the objects appeared to be spherical in shape.;36.2043689581094;-86.2975129967762
