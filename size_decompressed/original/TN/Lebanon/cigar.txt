Cigar Shapped object in clouds at sunset.;2013-08-16 20:00:00;5-6 minutes;Cigar Shapped object in clouds at sunset On August 16, 2013, I was driving on I-840 between Lebanon, TN, and Murfreesboro, TN, about dusk.  I was enjoying the beautiful large low clouds with the sun setting behind them and taking pictures with my I-phone.   I noticed that in front of one very large white cloud there was an elongated dark object.  It looked to be partially in the cloud but was clearly visible.   One end of the object was pointed and the other end was blunt.  It appeared to be moving southwest to northeast with the sharp end being the “front”.   I took a photo of the object with my I-phone and have looked it the picture enlarged and it’s inconclusive but does appear to be of an opaque object.   At this time I believe the object to have been a UFO.;36.2043689581094;-86.2975129967762
