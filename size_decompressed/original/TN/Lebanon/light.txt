Bright light in sky.;2016-07-26 20:00:00;~10 minutes;Bright light in sky I went onto my back patio it was around 8:00, and I looked westward and there was a very bright star looking object in the sky- except there were not any other stars visible as it was still light out and the sky was still blue.  It struck me as odd and I just watched it thinking maybe it was a plane but it stayed stationary in the sky.  I called for my husband and he came out and saw it too and noted there weren’t any other stars visible.  There weren’t any planes around either.  He went back inside the house.  I took pictures but they didn’t turn out so well.  Then it seemed like a dark plane came from behind it.  It was a black looking plane.  No noise.  I watched it fly away but it did seem like it came from under the bright object or behind it.  I snapped a few more pictures-  I looked down at my camera and when I looked back up it was gone.  I have gone out at the same time every night since then to see if there are any stars in that part of the sky even when it’s dark and there aren’t any.;36.2043689581094;-86.2975129967762
15 objects in a single file line disappearing.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-26 21:30:00;1 minute;15 objects in a single file line disappearing I was getting in my truck and seen approximately 15 objects in the sky thinking they were planes but then I realized they were in a straight line not to far apart from each other. I told my husband and sister in-law and they witnessed the exact same thing. After about a minute these lights started to disappear and then the last two lights merged together and disappeared as one. My husband tried to get a picture but the objects were to high in the sky to get a clear shot. All of this took place in Wilson County, Tennessee about 9:30 pm Central time.;36.2043689581094;-86.2975129967762
