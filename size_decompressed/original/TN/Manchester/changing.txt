Shape changing plasma type thing along a large jet stream in night sky;2008-10-12 21:00:00;Couple minutes;Shape changing plasma type thing along a large jet stream in night sky On Oct. 12 2008 approx. 21:00 toward the eastern sky my husband and I saw a large jet stream.I took several photos of it with a Sony camera.There is an object to it's upper right. That object changed it's shape several times within a few seconds.It was not visible in the lens to me at the time. When I went to look at the pictures I could not see the stream on the hp image zone so I looked at the image with the picture tool feature that adds light. It showed a changing plasma type thing along the jet stream. I am emailing the original and the enhanced versions of these two images.I have a few more.;35.4985999999997;-86.0847999999984
