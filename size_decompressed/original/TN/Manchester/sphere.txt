Green light trailing behind car on unlit highway;2011-06-07 01:30:00;20 seconds;Green light trailing behind car on unlit highway I was driving down highway 24 in Manchester, TN, on a dark, unlit road, having taken over for my girlfriend, who had begun feeling tired.  We had driven approximately 18 hours from Rhode Island. I was following a friend who was about 1 mile ahead of us (it was a very flat, straight road) when I noticed a glowing green orb in my rear view mirror.  I thought it was a light from an advertisement on the side of the road (billboard, shopping plaza, etc.)    So I checked my blind spots and looked around me and, after doing so, noticed that the glowing orb was now only visible in my left hand mirror and seemed to be hovering behind the car (I say hovering because it was almost level with my car, leading me to believe it was not an airplane, helicopter, etc.). My girlfriend then noticed me start to breathe heavy and take my eyes off the road and asked what was wrong.  I got some breath and told her to look behind us.  She questioned me and didn't look (she was tired) so I said Look!  When she did the glowing light had disappeared. The road was entirely dark both before and after this incident occurred.  I wish I were able to more accurately describe the events of this night;35.4985999999997;-86.0847999999984
