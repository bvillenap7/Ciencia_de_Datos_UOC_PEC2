Another (belated but discovered) Bonaroo witness. Science Major, SKEPTIC;2003-06-15 19:00:00;45 min-1 hour;Another (belated but discovered) Bonaroo witness. Science Major, SKEPTIC I can't believe I've found this place! I was also at the second bonaroo music festival.  After reading the other testimony, my stomach has been shaking and I am estatic to realize that no one had slipped me LSD or anything that made both me and my other friend question WHAT THE HELL THE GREEN ELLIPSE WAS????!!!!!  Our personal explination at the time (Still coherent, but a bit intoxicated from Jack Daniels and Coca- Cola and cigarettes, period. PERIOD.) was that if there were aliens that were studying humans, a change in poulation density from the area of Manchester, which is a farm/field for 51.5 weeks out of the year, would interest a reasearcher. Seriously, 100,000 people assemble for 3 days? I'd like to study that kind of population spike- something was happening... Also, being a HUMUNGOUS skeptic about the situation- in all honesty, it looked like the largest, luminous, ominous kite I've ever seen  If the thing was a kite, it must have been flying outside of the entire venue- I would have been able to see some kind of string to support a large craft like the one in question, or a quick reflection streak of light that would have caught my eye nothing though. I can't remember if it was windy in the first place...  It hovered very slowly as we almost forgot about the music and speculated, questioned, feared, and awed at what the hell this glowing green hovering object's purpose, orgin, and location were. Everyone else in our proximity were really intoxicated and were useless to get to pay attention... I take everything with a grain of salt. My friend swears that it was a UFO I am personally indifferent. it really does make sense for the aliens to study a population spike like a huge music festival, given that there are aliens with green ellipse-shaped craft that moves like a kite.  Honestly, it was truly un-conventional, unidentified, flying, and a tangible object. I can only pray to have my entire reality questioned like this again.  Unbelieveable.  I will go under polygraph any time, any day. I want to believe. I wanted to find out what that object was.  It dissappeared after an hour of noticing it though.
