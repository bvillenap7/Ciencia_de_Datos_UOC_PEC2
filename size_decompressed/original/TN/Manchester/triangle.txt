slow erie green craft;2003-06-15 21:30:00;3 mins;slow erie green craft if you get any more reports of this incident please email me, thanks  i was at the bonnaroo music festival outside of manchester tennesee it was the last show of the festival, the grateful dead    i would have to approximate on the time that i saw it, but just after it was no longer visible the band started playing darkstar so id approximate 9:15-9:45 when i first saw it the angle of elevation was atleast 60 or 70 degrees     it began off right stage and for appx  3 mins it rotated clock wise and slowly moved right across the sky   it had an erie green glow       the ufo itself was triangular or possibly had 3 darker areas that gave the impression of a triangle i approximated that if the object was 35 meters in length than it was atleast 2000-4000 meters in altitude      my friend whom had not drank more than a few drinks also witnessed it as i pointed it out   later a female friend also agreed that she had seen it when i mentioned it back at the camp sight                 i had not been drinking at all because i wanted to remember the show         i have an IQ of 135 and do not want to sound like im crazy    but i got the feeling the entire night that they were here to examine human emotion and the invisible ripple effect of feelings emotions and thoughts that were occuring       its the same reason that yawning is contagous thank you for listening to me   and i would love to hear back from you or look through photos to possibly point out any similar craft ((NUFORC Note:  NUFORC has received no other reports from any of the other attendees, to the best of our knowledge.
