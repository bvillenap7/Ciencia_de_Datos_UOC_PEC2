Strange diamond light patterns on driveway.  ((NUFORC Note:  Photos show discoloration of blacktop.  PD));2014-03-25 16:00:00;30 minutes;Strange diamond light patterns on driveway I am not at all certain what I saw.  It seemed to be a light pattern but I could find nothing in the sky or in the surrounding environment that could have been making the pattern.  It looked like two diamonds with one intruding a bit into the other, both with circles in the middle of them.  They were about four foot long and about a foot wide each.  I have them on video but not sure I can link that here.   There seemed to be a shimmer around them too that lingered momentarily when they would go away and come back.;35.4985999999997;-86.0847999999984
