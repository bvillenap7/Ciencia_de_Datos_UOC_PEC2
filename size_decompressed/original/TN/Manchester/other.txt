Pyramid-shaped UFO hovering low to the ground in Manchester, Tennessee.;2009-07-15 21:30:00;~30 seconds;Pyramid-shaped UFO hovering low to the ground in Manchester, Tennessee. It was during the month of July, 2009 when this happened.  Although I'm unsure of the exact day, I do know this is the exact month because I was driving to Tullahoma, Tennessee to pick up my aunt for a late viewing of the Ice Age 3 movie at the local theater. I was driving on I-24W toward Nashville I took exit 111 into Manchester to drive onto Tullahoma.  After one exits 111, to get to this destination, there is another left, then straight drive into Tullahoma.  Right after I made the left turn, I saw a hovering pyramid above the treetops. I didn't have a camera, nor a cell phone that would've taken a good enough picture, but I am an artist and I made sure to get a good look at the flying object so that I could draw it later on. The object was a three-sided pyramid.  It was a metallic, shiny black color.  On the first side I saw, there were 10 circular white lights, stacked in rows (4, 3, 2, 1).  The best way I can describe these lights is to compare them to the lights that overlook a baseball game.  On the next side, I looked back to see three small lights near its top, each different colors- red, green, and blue.  I was topping a hill when I first saw it and after crossing it, I could see underneath the craft it was hollow. The craft was hovering just above the treetops, I'd say about six to eight feet above the leaves.  On the opposite side of the median/road, cars were pulling over.  On my side of the road, all of us were slamming our brakes and two cars ahead of me, there was nearly a wreck.  This was proof to me that I wasn't the only one witnessing this. The craft was about 20ft wide and was a proportional triangle on each side, so perhaps about 20ft tall as well.  As I've said, the craft was hollow. I will provide an illustration as I saw it.

2 Pure white flashing lights flying then fireball falls from sky.;2017-12-02 08:30:00;5-10 minutes;2 Pure white flashing lights flying then fireball falls from sky. We observed an odd set of pure white blinking (simultaneous) lights of an unknown craft that would SPEED up & slow down erratically then stop at which time a large fireball fell slowly from it.  We noticed the craft circle around and head back the way it came SW as we watched the fireball until it was below tree line out of view.  THE craft (lights) continued to circle the area for another few minutes rising & falling in altitude impossible for any aircraft I've seen then sped off NW.  The lights would also alternate from horizontal to vertical at times.;35.4985999999997;-86.0847999999984
