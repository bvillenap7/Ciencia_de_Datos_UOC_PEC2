I saw 4 bright lights, 2 red in the front, 2 green in the back.;2018-04-12 05:00:00;1-2 minutes;I was driving west on hwy 41 around 5:20 in the morning.  I glanced up to look at the sky.  I then saw 4 bright lights, 2 red in the front, 2 green in the back.  The reason it caught my eye was, is the lights were incredibly bright.  They were not flashing nor rotating.   The object was headed north when it took a sharp turn and headed east and went over my vehicle.  As it passed over, I could see underneath the object, and it appeared to be rectangular in shape and black underneath.   The object was either very large or very close, it made no sounds at all.
