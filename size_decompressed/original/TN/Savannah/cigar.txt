((HOAX??))  long shiny grey ship moving very fast!  ((NUFORC Note:  Report from student.  PD));2007-05-07 23:00:00;1 minute;long shiny grey ship moving very fast! Me and a friend were outside star gazing for astronomy class and observed a long, shiny grey cylindrical object flying at approximately 900-1000 MPH. My friend is in the Air Force and estimated this speed based on his flight background. The object swooped down over us and seemed to almost touch the ground and then was gone in an instant. The object has 3 green/yellow lights up front and one red light in the back. It made no sound, they probably were in some kind of stealth mode. It was quick but we both saw it and couldn't believe our eyes. ((NUFORC Note:  Report from student.  PD));35.2028;-88.1986999999999
