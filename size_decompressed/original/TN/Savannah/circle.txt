I was sitting looking north and observed the object.  It was silver/gray color and was at about a 30-40 degree angle on the horizon from my vantage point.  I did not see a vapor/contrail from the object and there was a flash of light as it passed by at about 90 degrees from the sun.   I am a military veteran and am sure that this was not a jet,military or civilian as it was going very slow.;35.2028;-88.1986999999999
