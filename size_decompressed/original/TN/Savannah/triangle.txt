Triangle shaped UFO flying over West/Middle TN;2007-04-12 15:00:00;20 seconds;Triangle shaped UFO flying over West/Middle TN I was driving on a country road the day was clear and the sky was blue with white fluffy clouds.  I happen to glance up and over to my right and noticed black dots in the shape of a triangle moving across the sky toward the left, the pointy side of the triangle was facing left also.  Between the dots you could see blue sky so it seemed to be somewhat cloaked.  It was very high in the sky.  It was moving at a steady speed and suddenly it was as though the triangle flipped and was pointing back toward the right.  It shot through the sky at a superfast speed and disappeared.  There is no doubt had I not been looking directly at it I could easily have overlooked it. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));35.2028;-88.1986999999999
Triangle spotted over Savannah, TN.;2007-06-15 15:00:00;15 seconds;Triangle spotted over Savannah, TN. Driving down the road, I noticed to the right, and very high in the sky, a triangle, composed of black dots.  The blue sky was visible around the dots.  I could tell that this was not a flock of birds since the dots were moving at the same speed.   It was traveling extremely fast and the dot that formed the tip was pointed to the left and that was the direction of travel.  It made a sudden stop, and in a split second, was pointed in the other direction.  It accelerated and disappeared.   It was flying below the clouds, because I could see the clouds around the dots.  It was a clear day.   I was driving so I could not hear if it made a sound.  If I had not been looking up I would have easily missed seeing this craft.  I do not know what made me look up at that moment.   There were no lights of any kind, just black dots. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date above is approximate.
