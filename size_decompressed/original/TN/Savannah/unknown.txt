1 big white light with a row of red lights and a large red ball fell from under it to ground.;2010-04-30 20:00:00;1 hour;1 big white light with a row of red lights and a large red ball fell from under it to ground. Friday April 30 ,2010 between 8 and 9 p.m. we were under  a  tornado warning and it was lighting. I went outside on my front porch to watch the weather. As I was looking up in the sky I saw a  round bright light  with a row of red lights behind it. I thought maybe an airplane or helicopter but I knew there would not a an aircraft out in a storm. I watched as the lights would go on and off. The spotlight would scan back and forth  then shine my way. I could not tell the shape of the object   or the color because it was dark. The light came closer and spotlighted the backyard  of my neighbors house for a few seconds  then disappeared. I then yelled for my son who is 25 to come see. We watched it  reappear  in the same location with the lights on then from under the  this thing  a red ball about the size of the moon  fell straight to  the ground. No sounds, no fire ,nothing. Then up in the air it reappeared again with the spotlight scanning and the row of red l! ights going on and off. This event happened for about 45 minutes to 1 hour.;35.2028;-88.1986999999999
bright silver gray color fish shaped object. Very shiny and bright.;2010-05-03 00:00:00;30 seconds;bright silver gray color fish shaped object. Very shiny and bright. May 3,2010 at 7:45p.m. My second visual of an unusual object. We were at the baseball field and halfway through the game I was talking to a couple of people and looked up and saw this gray silver object in the air. I told everyone to look. It was very shiny as if the sun was reflecting off of it. It seemed to be mostly shaped like a rocket.  There was no sound, no lights, no smoke. It looked like it was floating with the front  of it a little lifted. It was not going slow or going fast.  Several people thought maybe a plane but it did not look or sound like a plane.  This time I had my camera and took several pictures. Some of them are hard to see but I am sharing  with you anyway.  There was also a lot of activity in the sky later that night and my friends and I observed  this at home after the game and it seems strange that I would witness this twice within a couple of days apart.;35.2028;-88.1986999999999
