I'm standing there with a spotlight and I see a red object way up in the sky.  ((anonymous report));2011-05-18 21:00:00;60 seconds;I went down to the barn to check on the roosters because the coyotes were out.  I'm standing there with a spotlight and I see a red object way up in the sky, kind of like a satellite.  For some reason, I flashed my spotlight at it 3 times.  As soon as I did this, I look forward above the barn and this craft just appears out of nowhere with 2 huge beams of light on the bottom of this thing.  It had a errodesen around it.  No noise or anything.  And the way that thing came down was like gravity didn't exist around it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
