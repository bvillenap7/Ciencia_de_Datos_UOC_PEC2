weird light that moved in the sky;2006-10-10 16:00:00;10 minutes;weird light that moved in the sky while driving toward selmer, tn my mom and i saw a very bright light in the sky.  it was almost as bright as the sun.  but it wasn't the sun because we could see both this object and the sun at the same time.  it would move back and forth slightly and would change shapes too.  at first we thought it was a reflection from a plane or something, but then the light moved quickly to the south and disappeared altogether.  then there was nothing there anymore.  just the blue sky.  it was honestly the most weird thing either of us had ever seen.  my mom doesn't want to tell anyone about it because she thinks people will think that we are crazy but i want to report it.
