Observed white, green and red lights hovering with very fast rotation!   ((NUFORC Note:  Sirius?  PD));2007-02-21 22:15:00;ongoing;Observed white, green and red lights hovering with very fast rotation in the form of diamond shape moving very slow  upward! Green, white and red mix of lights started out just above tree line about 22:15 and we observed it as it moved upward without moving east or west up to around 23:00 before we went to bed. After about 45 min. it had elavated to the point of having to look almost straight up. The lights looked like they where spinning so fast it made the form of a diamond shape. We observed many planes during that time and compared them,no chance of a plane or helicopter or any kind of aircraft like I had ever seen before. We used Nikon spotting scope and High powered Nikon Bino.  I read a post on this sight from 1/31/07 a couple from Bushey, England recently very much decribing the same kind of object. It was noted on this previous post the object could have been a star Sirius.  I'm going to look for the object again to night it should be another clear night. Send feed back if anybody may have some on what me and my wife where watching. Thanks ((NUFORC Note:  Sirius?  PD));35.1893;-86.1098
