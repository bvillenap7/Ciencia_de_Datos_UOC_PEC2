Round Glowing Ball seen by 6 people in Winchester, Tennessee on 7/4/20;2020-07-04 21:00:00;2 hours;Round Glowing Ball seen by 6 people in Winchester, Tennessee on 7/4/20 On July 4, 2020 at around 20:00 hours while boating on Tim's Ford Lake near Dry Creek Beach in Winchester, Tennessee, six people witnessed a glowing ball in the sky to the North/East of our location.  The time in which the the ufo was present is unknown, as we do not know how long it had been present before we noticed it, but  once we noticed the ufo, it was present for about 45 minutes or so afterwards.   At first we thought the ufo was a paper lantern but it stayed in the same spot the intire time.  After arriving home, the next day we looked on the internet to try to get an explanation for what we saw, and that's when we realized that several other witnesses from other states all around the country had seen the same thing.;35.1893;-86.1098
