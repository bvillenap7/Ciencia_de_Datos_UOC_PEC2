circle object that flew in arch then disappeared;2007-07-14 23:00:00;2 minutes;circle object that flew in arch then disappeared On Saturday, July 14th, at approximately 11:00 pm central time, I saw an object, no larger than a star, appear in the middle of the Big Dipper.  It flew, slowly east, then arched west (turning to my left).  Then, as if someone flicked a switch, it disappeared.  There were no flashing lights like an airplane.  And it seemed like it was too far up in the sky to be an airplane.;36.5014000000001;-86.8738
