Very Bright Green Diamond Shape with a Light Green Trail;2011-08-01 23:00:00;5 seconds;Very Bright Green Diamond Shape with a Light Green Trail I was outside looking at the stars with a friend and I noticed it from a distance.  Kept staring at it and it flashed right by us.  It was a BRIGHT Green diamond shape with a light green trail.  My friend noticed I was looking off to the side and by the time she looked over she could see a bright green area in the woods.  Kind of like an orb of green. We then looked at each other like...did you see that?  Then we ran into the house pushing and shoving through the door.;36.5014000000001;-86.8738
