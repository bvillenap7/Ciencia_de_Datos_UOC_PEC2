Two large Red Lights and a whistle sound.;2003-12-02 18:30:00;10-15 seconds;Two large Red Lights and a whistle sound. There was a very low object, just above the tree tops, going across the sky above our house. The sound was a low humming or whistle sound. There were 2 red lights in verticle alignment. The object was moving from SSE to NNW very slowly. Other neighbors also came out when the sound was heard. There are no airports within 15-20 miles from my house.;36.5438;-86.0245
