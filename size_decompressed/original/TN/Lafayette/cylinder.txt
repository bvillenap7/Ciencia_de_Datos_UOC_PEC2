Three UFO's appear out of thin air for 15 minutes then vanish.;2009-01-03 18:00:00;15 minutes;Three UFO's appear out of thin air for 15 minutes then vanish. My wife and I were driving home from visiting her parents. The sun was starting to set and then I noticed a strange looking craft in the sky. It looked to almost blend into the sky but appeared significantly brighter, a cylinder type object.  Hard to describe.  It must have been hundreds of miles away.  I watched it for about 5 minutes then I looked over at my wife and said Honey... what is that? She looked and said she didn't know but that there was another one over there and pointed about 45 degrees to the right.  After a few more minutes of watching them hover and slowly moving across the sky a third craft appeared.   Approximately 15 minutes had passed when they seemed to vanish into thin air.   I didn't think much of it until last week when I recalled the occasion to my wife and she blurted out I'm pretty sure they were UFO's!   It had always been in the back of my mind and now I'm positive that they were indeed not man-made.  I have never since seen anyt! hing like them.
