I looked out my bedroom window to see the progress of the snowfall.  After looking for a couple minutes I seen light flickering in the sky that caught my attention.  As I kept looking at the object it stayed stationary for around 5 minutes while it was stationary I could see red and green flickering lights.  The object then began to fly side to side at a very slow pass for about 3 minutes after the side to side movement stopped it slowly started to fly toward my trailer.  After flying slowly toward where I was it accelerated very quickly out of my line of sight.;36.5424;-82.7214
