The sky was black with a couple of low thinn clouds passing slowly.  It was exactly 8 o clock when we went outside to smoke.  I happen to look up in the sky and saw what appeared to be a golden bright star moving like an airplane in the sky to left and slightly above the Orion constellation.  I didn't think much of it until another light quickly caught up to the 1st out of nowhere at a speed and rate of acceleration and sudden deceleration that no aircraft could do this.  Both stopped for several minutes and began to follow each other in a circle shape.  They seemed to disappear after a while behind some clouds.  Several minutes later we saw several other lights zooming about in the same area eventually seeing 6 at once.  Some of them stayed still and would move slowly and only a small distance while others seem to bobble and play around in an almost childlike way.  One was stationary and it seemed to split into two separate lights.  One of them sped  away faster than my eye could follow.  Some of them would glow really bright and then dim in un related intrivels as they accelerate very quickly.  Eventually they seemed to dim or move up in altitude one by one until I could no longer see them anymore.  I didn't see anymore but an hour so later noticed a giant streak of light like a shooting star toward the north.  I seen an abnormally high amount of what looked like normal aircraft with flashing red lights moving in all directions through out the experience.  It was a very strange night I will never forget.;36.5424;-82.7214
