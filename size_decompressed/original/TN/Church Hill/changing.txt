Maybe it's not, maybe its light and clouds or there is an explanation.;2021-04-17 08:00:00;All morning;Maybe it's not, maybe its light and clouds or there is an explanation. This isnt the first time. It happens some nights, some mornings. At first I thought maybe its this, a cloud or light or reflection or maybe its my imagination, and I still don't know for sure. I dont see anything when i look, but i have mini cams up and I have video and pics from the mini cam.  First time I noticed them was at Night in March. I can't remember the date. It looked like a round light in the sky at a distance. Sometimes blinking, sometimes just still. Then one morning i noticed what appeared to be a light hiding in the clouds. I know it sounds strange. It's hard to explain and maybe its all in my mind. It appeared to move very quickly in and out of the clouds. Or almost like sitting on top of the clouds. Very quick and numerous. It looks like two will go into 1 or 1 will seperate into 2...sometimes it is just gone...there are cloud trails sometimes where it punches holes in the clouds...  I would like to really just submit this anonymously and if i can just send you the video footage and pics . I am hoping at the end of this form i have that option.  I saw beyond count numerous this morning. Seems like about every day or every couple days the sky is full. Not sure what other information you need. I only see this on my cam.;36.5424;-82.7214
