On 7/19/14, while vacationing in a cabin in the mountains just outside of Pigeon Forge, TN, I saw an unidentified object in the night sky.   My niece and I were outside, on the balcony, it was overcast from the rain earlier in the day but was starting to clear.  Suddenly, I saw a very bright white circular light behind the clouds, crossing the night sky at a very high rate of speed.  It only took  2-3 seconds for the object to cross over from the ENE to the WSW.   Because my niece was composing a text to her boyfriend at that moment, she didnâ€™t see it.;35.7924935483871;-83.5672830645161

The assumed fireball entered my field of vision from the right (west) and disappeared over the mountains to the south.  It seemed to be traveling west to east.   There seemed to be no tail, smoke or other material coming from the fireball.  The object was white and did not change colors or size.   The sighting lasted 3 to 4 seconds.;35.7924935483871;-83.5672830645161
