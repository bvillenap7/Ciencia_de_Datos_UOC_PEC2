bright light;2004-01-11 11:00:00;:30;Living up North (Indiana) I enjoy a web page that has a live web cam of the smoky  mountains http://www2.nature.nps.gov/air/webcams/parks/grsmcam/grsmcam.htm I have it on my desktop at work and it is always cool to see the current weather and the view But Last night (1/11/04) the web cam captured a very bright light that took Â½ hour or more to move across the picture  I can send you the images if you want, But did anybody else see this or was I more tried than I thought?  Thank you ((name and e-address deleted));35.7924935483871;-83.5672830645161
Light moving in strange patterned flight over Pigeon Forge, Tennessee;2007-03-21 06:05:00;over 1 hour;Light moving in strange patterned flight over Pigeon Forge, Tennessee I was at work at a log cabin resort where I work nights. I stepped out on the balcony to smoke a cigarette. I looked up at the sky and saw several stars and noticed one that was particularly bright. As I watched it, I noticed that it was moving in very distinct and changing patterns. Thinking that I must be moving, I steadied myself against the railing and the object was still moving. Thinking I must still be moving, I backed up against the building and placed my back and head against the wall...still moving. I looked at the surrounding celestial objects (stars etc) and they were all standing still. As I watched, the object moved back and forth at breakneck speeds. It wouldn't curve when it changed course but, instead it would reverse direction in a straight line. Occasionally the object would stop and just hover in place, then it started moving in patterns, sometimes in a circle, sometimes in a figure eight, sometimes in a triangle pattern, always stopping and hovering before changing patterns. This went on and on, after twenty minutes, I went and got the two ladies working in the laundry and they confirmed that they saw the same thing. They also noticed that the object was changing colors, always white but sometimes bluish whate and other times a greenish/yellowish white. During the incident, a helicopter flew over, I could hear the helicopter but the object made no noise whatsoever. Still trying to disprove what I was seeing, I thought perhaps that a thermal was rising in front of the object making it appear to move but, just before dawn a heavy fog rolled in and eveything in the sky disappeared except for this object which was still faintly visible. Around 7am, two other female employees came in and I showed them and they saw the exact same thing. It was the weirdest thing I ever saw, I am going to try to take a video camera to work in case the object returns.;35.7924935483871;-83.5672830645161
3 Red Orange Objects with strange movements;2013-11-03 02:15:00;6-8 minutes;3 Red Orange Objects with strange movements 11/4/2013  This sighting happened along Wears Valley Rd. just outside Pigeon Forge, TN, in the wee hours of Sunday morning 11/3/13.  I was driving home from work just after 2am when I noticed something in the sky just ahead.  As I began to look closer, I could tell that, in fact, it was 3 objects, fairly close together.  They were all the same red/orange color, with no flashing at all. One of the objects was much larger than the other two.  I could not tell if that was caused by more distance or not. all these objects were moving slowly toward the southwest.  The two smaller appearing objects were on different trajectories from each other as well as the larger one.  I stopped my car beside the road and got out to watch. As I watched, the larger object was continuing on its slow path when suddenly, the two smaller objects began to make seemingly erratic movements.  What seemed even more odd about this is that both would make their movements at the same time, start...stop...start...stop, very quickly and instantly at what seemed to be random directions.  After a few seconds of this action, the two smaller ones just blinked out. I watched the larger object continue on, and then jumped back into my car and tried to follow along the same direction, but the mountains and trees blocked my view.  I did not see any more action. The total time in my view was probably around 6 to 8 minutes.  I never did hear any sound at all.  I did make a photo on my cell phone, and it shows up as a light. No detail, but shows that SOMETHING was there.;35.7924935483871;-83.5672830645161
