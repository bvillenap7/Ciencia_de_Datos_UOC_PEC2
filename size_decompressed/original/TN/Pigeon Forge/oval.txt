Balls of fire.;2013-12-25 19:40:00;5 minutes;Balls of fire. Went out to my balcony, facing South in Pigeon Forge.  Saw this big ball like objects slowly floating down and on fire.  Eventually the fire seemed to go out, and the balls just floated on past the horizon, presumeably to land.  Not necasarrily aliens, but it appeared to be some kind of craft breaking apart.  The objects wobbled in the air and seemed to react very strange.  When they were no longer on fire, they appeared blue/orange in color.;35.7924935483871;-83.5672830645161
