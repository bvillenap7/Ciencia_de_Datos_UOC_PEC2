It hovered in the same position for 30-45 minutes, at least that's as long as I saw it before I went inside.  I briefly thought that it might have been some kind of drone, but the longer it hovered in the same place I believe it could have been a UFO.   I didn't see those lights any other time besides that night, & I know for sure it wasn't a cell tower, radio tower, etc. because I had the same view in daytime.
