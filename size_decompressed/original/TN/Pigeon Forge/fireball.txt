UFO siting in Pigeon Forge, TN.;2013-06-19 22:30:00;2 minutes;UFO siting in Pigeon Forge, TN We were staying in a hotel in Pigeon Forge while we were on vacation last week.  My mom and I were outside on the patio relaxing before we went to bed.  We sat there talking.  I looked up into the sky and noticed a ball of fire that was just kind of sitting there.  It resembled an orange street light that was way up in the sky.   Suddenly, it began moving very fast from side to side and up and down.  At this point, my mother noticed it.  We both looked at each other and said &quotWhat was that?&quot   We watched it for about 2 minutes and it went up into the clouds, the ball of fire slowly disappearing.  Then it was gone...
