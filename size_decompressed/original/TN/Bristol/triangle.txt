I turned off the deck light and went outside to jump. I was jumping, when i noticed there were 3 lights, in a perfectly semetrical triangle.It was going fairly fast in the sky, and it was kind of high, and I looked for about 10 seconds and it went behind the trees to where i couldnt see it. I ran to see where it was headed, and it was gone. This is the first UFO experience ive ever had.;36.5686000000001;-82.1818999999998
Large Triangle shaped object witnessed with possible injuries;2004-10-02 05:30:00;10 minutes;Large Triangle shaped object witnessed with possible injuries MUFON Tennessee Preliminary report: In the early morning hours of Saturday, October 2nd, witness reported he was driving home from his work. He was several miles from his home in a very rural area, when in the distance, he saw what appeared to be a fire on a hillside. As he drove closer, it became apparent that the fire was not a fire at all, but a large moving object. He came to a crossroad near his home and he stopped and exited his car to get a better look. Upon exiting, he described that the object was moving from the north and toward him. He stated that the fire which he thought he was seeing turned out to be three huge bubble shaped lights on the bottom of a giant triangular craft, moving straight at his location quite slowly, maybe 40-50 mph and at treetop level. He became afraid and started to run but then realized that there was nowhere to run to.The craft passed directly over him and he stated that the lights which were burning brightly, lit the bottom of the craft and he could plainly see rib-like structures evenly spaced across the object, having the greatest definition along the centerline of the craft. he also stated that the object covered the entire sky and appeared to be several hundred feet wide and also equally long. The craft was described as being highly reflective, metallic. As the craft passed over him, he states that the sound seemed to reverberate through his body, described as a low frequency throbbing hum. The witness also stated that his skin seemed both to be tingling and burning . After several seconds the object passed to the south of the witness and turned west, without banking and quickly moved away to the west. This witness reported the events to me on Sunday, October 3rd. He stated that at this time he had awaken with a metallic taste in his mouth and also had a slight nosebleed. Today, October, 4th, While I was interviewing the witness he showed me his back which looked slightly sunburned and called me later today telling me that his face feels burned  and he feels weak and tired. I have advised him to seek medical attention . It should be noted that this witness is highly reliable, retired military. Faa radar facility at tri some 20 miles away logged no anomolous returns or logged any reports from aircraft or citizens. This is only a preliminary report and futher investigation will be nessecary.
