Videotaped disc shaped  craft in broad daylight;2003-08-02 19:45:00;15 minutes;Videotaped disc shaped  craft in broad daylight At 19:45 hours EST, my son and myself were standing in our driveway talking.  For some reason, and about at the same moment we both saw an object in the sky to our NNW.  At first, I thought it to be a balloon and called my wife to bring the binoculars.  This object, through the binoculars , was flattened, perfectly disc shaped and was wobbling and rolling side to side and up and down.It did grow a little closer to us and it reflected sunlight as it turned. Positively metallic, smooth and disc shaped. We watched it for a while and I ran in and got the camcorder and digital camera. I have about 5 minutes of absolutely fantastic footage on the tape , but the digital camera failed miserably. The object slowly moved NNW until it was out of sight. I am ex military (13 years) and proficent in aircraft identifcation and this one was not in the books!! All I can say is I got proofâ€¦ ((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken with the witness by telephone, and he sounds adamant as to having captured a UFO on video.  We have looked at still images taken from the video, and they indicate a round, dark object against a daylight sky.  The witness reports having forwarded a copy of the video to NUFORC, which should arrive soon.  We will view it, and report here.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note #2:  NUFORC has received the tape, and it is exceptionally interesting, we believe.  It is some of the most intriguing video footage of a suspected UFO we believe we have seen in several years.  The video shows a very thin, distinctly disc-shaped object maneuvering in a cloudless sky, in a fashion which is totally uncharacteristic of a conventional aircraft.  The tape is under analysis by a video specialist.  We may post some still images from this tape.  PD));36.5686000000001;-82.1818999999998
MUFON/TENNESSEE REPORT:  Disc filmed in daytime sighting;2004-02-29 17:30:00;15 minutes;Disc filmed in daytime sighting At 17:30 hours my wife called me at home from approx. a mile from our home on a highway where she, my son and other people in cars were slowing down watching a disc shaped object  over their heads, high in the sky. I live on a hill so i was able to see the object and viewed it through binoculars and then with a video camera. The object was lensatic in shape but too far away to make out any details except for shape and color. The object had an aspect ratio of  about 6-1 and was highly reflective on one surface and flat black on the other, or so it appeared. I watched and filmed the object for about 5 minutes as it ascended at a 45 degree angle until it was out of sight.Video has been submitted to MUFON for analysis. ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Mr. Kim Shaffer, MUFON Assistant State Director for Tennessee, for this report with NUFORC.  Mr. Shaffer can be reached at <shaffer56@earthlink.net>.
