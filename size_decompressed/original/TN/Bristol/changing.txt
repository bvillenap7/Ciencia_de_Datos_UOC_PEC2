TENNESSEE MUFON REPORT:  Slowly falling, plasma-like object.;2005-10-31 19:40:00;90 seconds;Slowly falling, plasma-like object My mother and myself had just exited our home when we saw at approximately 60-75% elevation, a very bright egg shaped light that at first appeared to be aircraft landing lights.  As soon as we began watching it, it changed into a orange colored , misshapen glowing mass and began descending.  It slowly meandered downward(unlike a meteor) and seemed to drip orange fire like burning plastic.  As this took place, the object descended behind distant trees and we no longer saw it.  My father contacted the local FAA office but unfortunately, they did not see this from their vantage point in the tower.
