Bright white/silver object over Bristol, TN.;2014-03-10 14:45:00;1-2 minutes;Bright white/silver object over Bristol, Tn A friend and myself were standing outside trimming trees when we seen it.  Out of the corner of our eyes we happened to see a ball of an object that was bright white/silver.   The object was roughly 1-2 miles above us.  It slowly started to move away from us and within 2-3 seconds it was out of sight.   There were no noise, extra lights, or even a condensation trail behind the object.   It was nothing we have seen before.;36.5686000000001;-82.1818999999998
A large red orb, moving S to E at low speed in atmosphere, the at hyper speed disappeared at 150*. ((anonymous report));2016-07-30 21:45:00;5 minutes;A large red orb moving S to E at low speed in Atmosphere, the at hyper speed disappeared at 150* on compass in upper atmosphere To Whom It May Concern:  When I got home from the Bristol Pirates Game on July 30, 2016, approximately between 9:30 and 10:30 I went to walk my dog and observed a slow moving red orb heading down Volunteer Parkway from BMS toward the Walmart on Volunteer Parkway.  It appeared as if it were going to pass over the house which is located behind Walmart.  I ran inside the house to get my girlfriend so that she could also see it as it passed over.   As I came back outside, I observed it traveling at a high rate of speed, heading southeast, at approximately 150 on a compass and observed it as it became a small dot and went out of sight. I tune into News 5 at 11:00 to see if anyone else had observed it. During your weather segment they showed a time laps from BMS camera that would have had the red orb in view. If you are as curious as I am to what this was, you may be able to pick up footage on that weather camera from July 30, 2016 between 9:30 and 10:30.
