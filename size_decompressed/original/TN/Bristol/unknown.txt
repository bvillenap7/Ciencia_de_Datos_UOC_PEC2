MUFON TENNESSEE REPORT:  Tennessee  confirmation of sighting.;2005-10-31 21:40:00;90 seconds;MUFON  Tn. confirmation of sighting Confirming that MUFON Tennessee recieved 6 witness reports of a descending object which exibited peculiar charateristics. These reportees were within a 50 mile radius. Descriptions are almost identical of a slowly descending object which was relatively N.E. of this area:(36.5950°N, 82.1890°W) and began at a high elevation.  Relative size, according to witness(es) descriptions was that of a golf ball initially.The object meandered slowly as it descended, became a bright plasma-like light twice during it's descent and exibited the appearance of burning paper before being described as melting and dripping plastic by witnesses. All witnesses described that the phenomenon had not terminated before descending below their horizon. Subsequent inquiries have not confirmed our suspicion of this having been a meteorite or man-made space debris.

Strange black shadow that blocked the moon along with weird rush of wind.;2012-06-29 21:00:00;less than 1 minute;Strange black shadow that blocked the moon along with weird rush of wind. At about 9pm eastern standard time the power went off to over 10,000 people.  People went outside thier homes to talk to see if anyone know why it was off.    While standing outside a huge rush of wind came(over 50mph).  There was not a cloud in the sky but there was a fist shaped shadow that was in front of the moon at this same time. I have spoke to people who witnessed this too.  I have spoken to people from 6 different locations that all felt the strange wind and saw the black shadow across the moon.  These people were in different towns some over 25 miles apart.  This was not a cloud.  This had a dense shape to it.  The sudden wind was very abrupt and when it ended the shadow was just gone.   At 9pm it is still light enough out that if this was a cloud or a plane you could have seen it move away from in front of the moon. It just disapeared.  I know of 6 people but if you check  I am positive that more people then that saw this formation or whatever it is.;36.5686000000001;-82.1818999999998
