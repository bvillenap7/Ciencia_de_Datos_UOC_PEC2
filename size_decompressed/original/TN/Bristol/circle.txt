Green light traveling southwest @ high rate of speed.;2014-07-19 22:45:00;3 seconds;Green light traveling southwest @ high rate of speed. I was heading south on Volunteer Parkway, when I noticed an object traveling in a southwest direction that was illuminated green in color moving very fast.   I only saw it for about 2 to 3 seconds and at first thought it was a meteor entering the Earth's atmosphere, but afterwards I realized it didn't have a trail or light tail like most meteors one sees.;36.5686000000001;-82.1818999999998
