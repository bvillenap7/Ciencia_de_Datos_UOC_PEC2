Brilliant white light over Bristol, TN traveling at super speed, then cutting a 45 degree angle then phasing out of sight.;1999-06-01 23:00:00;3 minutes;Brilliant white light over Bristol, TN traveling at super speed, then cutting a 45 degree angle then phasing out of sight. My wife, my three children and myself had gone to a double feature drive-in movie in Bristol, TN back in 1999. We were laying on blankets just outside of the vehicle and the kids had just fallen off to sleep shortly after the first film ended. During the second film I was looking up into the night sky and noticed just how beautiful the stars were in the moonless, cloudless sky. After a couple of minutes I noticed a brilliant white light moving horizontically through the night sky at what seemed to be at a super fast speed (Note: it was not a falling star - I've seen a million of those and they move at a much slower pace and tend to be falling down in the sky this object moved sideways). The light traveled in a perfectly straight line over 90% of the entire body of the night sky. I had my wife observe it as well. We watched it move to the corner of the sky at which time it made a perfect 45 degree angled turn upward (not like a falling star) into the sky (I've never seen anything cut an angle like that). Then in just two seconds, the moving object proceeded to go into some kind of hyper-speed and it looked like a stepping stone in the sky and then it gradually faded out forming a blurry intermittent line and then vanished. I thought it was the coolest thing I had ever seen. My wife refuses to talk about it to this very day. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

bright multi colored object moving north over east tenn and southwest Va;2001-02-02 19:20:00;10 minutes;bright multi colored object moving north over east tenn and southwest Va bright multi colored light in eastern sky.  At first we thought it was an approaching aircraft with unusually bright oddly colored landing lights on.  It was bright white with  shots of blue and red or yellowish red coming off it, sort of like a diamond reflecting sunlight.  We thought then maybe some sort of satelite reflecting the sun which had set an hour or so earlier.  However it moved to the south continuing to flicker the different lights until lost behind the mountains.  It was much brighter than a plane for the distance it was.  A close plane with its landing lights coming into our local airport would be about the right brightness, but when it moved away it was obvious that it was several thousand feet if not several miles away.  No sound was heard, a private plane was circling between us and it and we assumed they were watching it as well.  Another couple in the parking lot with us watched it for about 5 minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  We believe the witnesses may have been observing the star, Sirius, also known as the Dog Star.  It is very bright, in the southeast sky at the time and date indicated, and it twinkles quite prominently, giving off principally blue and red flashes of light.

Saw 7 dim lights flying over Bristol TN very high up. Flew in formation, except the center light which occasionally left and returned.;2018-12-24 22:30:00;1 hour;Saw 7 dim lights flying over Bristol, TN, very high up.  Flew in formation, except the center light which occasionally left and returned. Saw 7 lights over Bristol, TN.  The lights were moving in a formation quickly considering their relative distance. We could not see all of the lights at all times except for the one in the center of the formation which was the brightest and would occasionally leave the formation and then return.  The other 6 would be seen moving and flashing.  They were not very bright but due to their speed of movement appeared to be relatively close to the atmosphere.  This was viewed by myself and one other for an hour even getting out riflescopes to view them at points.  We eventually shrugged it off as just a satellite or stars.  But satellites don’t fly that close together and they definitely don’t fly in formation.;36.5686000000001;-82.1818999999998
