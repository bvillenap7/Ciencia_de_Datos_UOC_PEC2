brilliant green object  going down S.W. of Bristol;2001-06-17 22:20:00;2 minutes;brilliant green object  going down S.W. of Bristol I was hanging sheetrock and just happened to see a brilliant green  flash out the window, to the s>w of Bristol.It was the brightest light I have ever seen in the night sky. I cant rule out a meteor, due to the objects tragectory which was approx. 30 degrees to the horizon and went down really slow from my point of view. It was truly a fantastic sight, large, round ,green ,bright and dropping smaller fragments, also burning green. ((NUFORC Note:  We presume the witness meant to indicate a time of 10:20 p.m..  We have amended the time here.  Please see other report from Florida for 2216 hrs. on this date.  PD)) FOLLOW-UP REPORT FROM MUFON IN GEORGIA:  Hey Peter, Tom Sheets SD in Georgia here.  Last night, Sunday 17June, about 10:30PM, a large spectacular bluish meteor sailed thru the skies over Atlanta and in particular, Lawrenceville, which is a few miles NE of the metro area.  Witness reported a UFO to the SE over Lawrenceville.  By luck, our MUFONGA Deputy Director of Investigations also lives in Lawrenceville and was outside at about 10:30PM and saw the same thing.  He advised me that it was definitely a meteor.....in the event you get any reports.  Best  Tom Sheets ((NUFORC Note:  Our gratitude to Tom Sheets, State Director of MUFON/Georgia, for this information.  Tom can be reached at <MUFONGA@webtv.net>.
