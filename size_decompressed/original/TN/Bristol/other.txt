Boomerang shape in daylight;2002-08-14 15:01:00;20 min;Boomerang shape in daylight At 3:00, I heard a loud aircraft and looked skyward to the east. I did not see the plane, but saw a strange, boomerang shape, silvery and distant. The clouds are broken at around 8-10,000 feet,moving east, and this object was moving opposite the clouds, to the west, in and out of the clouds erratically. I had my wife keep an eye on it while I ran to get the binoculars and camcorder. Blinded from the sun, It took a while, 5 minutes to get back to looking. I saw the object through binoculars but could not get a fix on it with the camcorder. By this time, it was much higher, well above the clouds moving north then west, then back north. Through the binoculars the shape was clearly boomerang and would stop motionless for several seconds then move again. Each time, in a different trajectory, but generally northward until I lost it behind a cloud. I'm glad someone besides me saw it, but wow! ((NUFORC Note:  One of two reports from same witness.

MUFON/TN REPORT:  Two joined objects spotted during nightly observations.;2004-06-16 22:27:00;4 minutes;Two joined objects spotted during nightly observations. I was outside doing my nightly(clear night) observations with my binoculars and video camera when I spotted a rather large object, brilliantly lit, coming on a straight path, SW to NE and at what appeared to be a high elevation. The light was reddish white, apparent size was that of a pea at arm's length, magnitude about three/ four times Venus. I began taping because I did not hear any noise associated with aircraft. As the object passed to my west, I could see that it was two large spherical lights, one behind the other. There were no nav lights, no noise, no change in intensity as these lights went off to the NE.  I also checked the position of the ISS, which was mid Pacific, heading southeast. ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Kim Shaffer, MUFON State Director from Tennessee, for submitting the report.  Mr. Shaffer can be contacted at <shaffer56@earthlink.com>, and we urge anyone who may have witnessed the same object to contact him via e-mail.  PD));36.5686000000001;-82.1818999999998
Follow-up to east coast sighting on August 31st  ((NUFORC Note:  Result of earlier missile launch.  PD));2004-08-31 20:30:00;20 minutes;Follow-up to east coast sighting on August 31st Follow-up to the major sighting which occurred on 08/31/04 at 20:35  hours over the eastern U.S. I have now learned that the anomolous object was , in fact,  a fuel dump/seperation  created by a spacecraft which was launched from Cape Canaveral last evening. It has been stated that the fuel dump is a usual practice for all Centuar booster assisted launches. The launch was the last to take place from pad 36A at the cape and marks an end to an era. The launch took place at 7:17 EDT (23:17 GMT) and seperation took place 73 minutes later , marking about the exact time for the reported anomolous object to appear in the eastern sky.

Large white object with strobe light  spotted during nightly skywatching  ((NUFORC Note:  Result of earlier missile launch.  PD));2004-08-31 20:35:00;15 minutes;Large white object with strobe light  spotted during nightly skywatching At the beginning of my nightly skywatch, I went outside and noticed a very bright elongated light in the western sky at about 65 degrees  elevation.I first tried to acquire the anomoly with my camera which was malfunctioning. I then acquired it with my binoculars and could plainly see a strobe on the very point of the object, flashing white in about a .5 second cycle. As the anomoly moved eastward slowly, it began looking more like a cloud, which was formed to this apparent shape(see attached) but being extremely dense , especially nearest the strobe.The shape was perfectly symmetrical and well defined.  The light stopped flashing after a minute or so and was no longer visible. As the anomoly moved east over about another 10 minutes  into the darkness it seemed to disappate, just as an ordinary cloud would do, but it moved into the darkness and I may simply have not been able to see the unlit anomoly in the sky.

Lobed object seen moving westerly at high altitude;2004-09-04 19:54:00;8 minutes;Lobed object seen moving westerly at high altitude Nightly observations on this date, I was looking westward when I saw this object which was moving west and appeared to stop and start moving again momentarialy.  I acquired the object with my camera at max optical zoom, (40X) and was suprised to see an object made up of lobes, 3 and possibly 4, being highly reflective, metallic and appearing to roll and tumble as it moved west. the object did make several small angular course changes as it moved. After several minutes, the object simply disappeared. I did check wind direction before concluding the object was not an errant balloon. the object was moving westerly and the winds were from the west, excluding this theory.;36.5686000000001;-82.1818999999998
