Orange comet shaped fireball changing into just fireball rapidly climbing. Sighted near Bristol Motor Speedway.;2016-10-02 19:45:00;3 minutes;Orange comet shaped fireball changing into just fireball rapidly climbing. Sighted near Bristol Motor Speedway. Sighted in moving car.  3 miles from race track (Springfield Acres subdivision).  Looked like a fireball at first.  Orange ball with an orange ice cream cone tail coming to a point.  Out of car it had turned into just a large orange ball moving rapidly North North East.  Looked like a jet plane at night except light size was much bigger, at least 5 times bigger, and orange like a camp fire flame.  Went behind clouds.  At first sight in the car I though it might be a hot air balloon.  Out of car I thought it might be a rocket or a jet plane on fire because it was moving so fast.  Shrunk quickly in size but not in intensity.  No sound.  Neighbors weren't out so no one around me had noticed.
