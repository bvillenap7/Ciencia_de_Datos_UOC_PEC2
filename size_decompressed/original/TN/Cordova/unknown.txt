At around 10 P.M. (I am not sure if that was the time) a couple of friends and I were driving around Cordova when this blue ball or light or something fell out of the sky.  A bunch of other people saw it too.  It wasn't like a craft it was a ball.  It made the kind of noise that you would here a missle make.  We were freaked out and called a bunch of radio stations and it just sat there in the ground until these people came and picked it up, but by then we were gone so I couldn't see if the one's who took it were police or FBI or whoever.  It freaked the hell out of me! I thought that for sure it would be all over the news, but it wasn't.  The radio stations kept it going for maybe an hour and then we heard nothing about it.  I don't know if it was some kind of light from an air plane or what!;35.1625454545455;-89.780490909091
