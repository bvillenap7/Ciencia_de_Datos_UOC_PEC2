Large triangular- shaped object traveling East to West at approx.Mach 1-1.5 over North Memphis, Tennesee;2009-11-24 21:39:00;30 seconds;Large triangular-shaped object travelling East to West at approx.Mach 1-1.5 over North Memphis, Tennesee I have been a commercial pilot since 2001.  I have studied aircraft since the age of 4.  I have seen many strange things in the air, but nothing compared to this.  At approx.2139 hrs on 24 Nov 2009, I was watching departing air traffic from MEM pass overhead looking North.  Something caught my eye to the East.  I turned, and saw a Triangle-shaped object that had large dull white lights at all corners.  It was either in a right-hand bank turning North, or it was flying due West at a tilt because I could see the bottom of the object while it was apparently miles to the North of me.  It traveled at approx. Mach 1-1.5.  It was completetly silent.  That impacted me quite a bit because being a glider pilot as well, I know that even a glider at higher speeds causes a lot of noise through aerodynamic means as air is split around the aircraft.  The object passed below a departing CRJ-200 from MEM.  I would love to know if anything was picked up on the aircraft's TCAS, or by MEM Center.   I have the urge to call them, but fear the backlash that may follow.  It was approximately 200 ft across to all corners.  It had a dull grey looking surface, and as I said earlier the 3 large white lights were dull.  I don't drink, or use drugs.  I have had an FAA pilot's license for over 20 years, and been with the airlines since 2001...I still feel stunned, even though it's been over 12 hrs ago.;35.1625454545455;-89.780490909091
