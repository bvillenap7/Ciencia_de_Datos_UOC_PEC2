Flying saucer alien ship spotted in split sec, before disappearing behind the treeline.;2017-12-20 12:00:00;2-3 seconds;flying saucer alien ship spotted in split sec, before disappearing behind the treeline. I was driving into work like I normally do, except due to the holidays this was a rare occurrence. I usually leave for work at either 10am or the sun has already set by the time I get to this spot. It was between exits on I-40 before exit 18 and the bridge that goes over US-64. I was driving and I look up to see a large (but not huge, closer to medium size) alien ship.  It was very shiny and the lid was either reflecting the sun (no clouds in the sky, very clear).  It appeared suddenly (I didn't look up in time to remember which direction is had movement from.) it stayed still for a split second and disappeared out of my horizon because of the trees.  It seemed to be close in the area to a plane, because that was what I tied it to at first.  After seeing it, and because it was so sudden, I hadn't entirely decided it was real.  I studied the plane I'd also spotted and caught a few glimpses of an object that I can't identify as what I'd seen just split second befor! e, but the object(s) I glimpsed weren't normal planes either.  They looked like flying circles.  But my eyes were unable to focus hard enough on them, because by this time I'm needing to merge with traffic.
