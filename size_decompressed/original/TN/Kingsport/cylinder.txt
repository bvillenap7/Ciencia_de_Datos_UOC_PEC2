Why is The Hubble Telescope flying so low?;2011-08-16 20:00:00;10 seconds;Why is The Hubble Telescope flying so low? On Tuesday evening, (August 16, 2011) I was preparing to go for my nightly walk.  After lacing my tennis shoes and listening to ( my girlfriend ) ((name deleted)) speak, I noticed the oven clock registered 8:05 and I patted my thigh for my camera/phone which I did not have this time but grabbed my walking stick and proceeded through the garage anyway.Leaving the driveway and turning slightly right onto Cliffside Road, I became aware of the tapping cadence of my stick and pondered leaving it behind but did not. Turning slightly right atop the 50 yard incline of Cliffside, now on South Drive, I heard children playing and spotted them above the church as I walked toward bustling Fort Henry Drive.  I couldn't help but wonder why children would play on such a dangerously steep driveway slope.   As I reached Fort Henry Drive i waited on traffic recanting the irony of ((name deleted)) not tolerating crossing the street for a quiet walk.  Tap, tap my stick rings my advance up the steep drive between RHA and the Seventh Day Church drives.  Coming to my usual flat rock,facing South, I habitually stand both feet together while staring down into the craggy boulders beneath, craning to see any life scurrying about.   As I look up the tree at about 10-12 feet  I am aware of the slight dusk- breeze and the sudden break in traffic noise. Suddenly, I am staring straight at an elongated shiny craft resembling a two-piece telescope,with two distinctly different colors of metal, patchwork assembled like bricks, with opposing flat panels mid section about an eighth the width of total craft length.  The schock of its silence, ghostily speeding near mach 1 was mezmerising, I stepped back, leaned on my walking stick as the object glinted on the left mid side, then right mid side before glinting out about 3 inches above the mountain peak behind Wal-Mart.  I was coherent enough to judge the objects scale as 6-8 times the diameter of the Sun, level, and wondered if 20 tractor-trailers! could fill its mass.I stared at nothingness for another 30-40! seconds before traffic noise pulled me toward home, completely avoiding my normal walk route.  My walk this night, a bit unusual, I could not wait to draw out what I'd just witnessed.  There were no clouds, no planes, and no rationale for what just happened to me. Once inside the kitchen I shakily fumbled for paper and pen and hurriedly scratched out a sketch,told ((name deleted)) i saw a UFO over Wal_mart, and logged on to NASA ISS Live Orbit Feed just as the ISS was about to cross over Africa. Looking at its elavation: 245 miles, speed, 17, 347 mph,and azimuth the schedule read it would be visable over Kingsport the 16th of August for 3 minutes.......245 MILES !........I just saw a UFO that resembled the Hubble Telescope!  The next day I was interviewing for a new job and took the time to log this report.  The folowing day, Thursday I reenacted my walk sequence gathering more accurate details, called the t.v., newspaper and local radio stations asking about other sightings- nothing but laughter.  Called the TriCities Airport Tower and asked of Tuesday anomolies-nothing.Posted an inquiry on my faceBook status:  nothing but criticism.  I'd say I really have seen a UFO now.;36.538247188755;-82.54081184739

Got on ISS live feed as ISS orbits over Africa, but schedule reports Kingsport TN sighting at 21:32 p.m. for 3 minute duration.(?)  It's now 21:32;36.538247188755;-82.54081184739
3 Objects following one another.  Videoed as well.;2013-06-15 16:00:00;3 minutes;3 Objects following one another.  Videoed as well. I videoed I thought was one Object that we see almost on any clear day, but in fact it became 3 Object's one behind the other.  Not a sound was made by the Object's.  A friend of mine from MUFON has seen the video plus the computer enhanced one as well. I take this subject serious so I'm not wasting anyone's time like many other do.;36.538247188755;-82.54081184739
