Triangular craft with multicolored lights;1982-12-15 21:00:00;30 seconds;Triangular craft with multicolored lights I heard a humming sound much quieter than a typical small aircraft but loud enough to get my attention.  I turned in the direction of the humming and saw a vehicle rising above trees at a small park.   The vehicle had 3 large white lights in the front with many colored lights along the wing edges.  The overall shape appeared to be triangular, delta or perhaps a chevron.  The center white light was pointed straight down as the craft was rising but swiveled up to point straight ahead matching the other two white lights when it was just above the trees.   Once above the trees the craft started to move forward on a path that took it in my general direction.  At this point the three white lights went out and only the multi-colored lights on the wing edges remained on.  The craft accelerated while gaining altitude and moved out of my field of view.

East Tennessee, 3 orb mass in the sky;2008-10-01 22:55:00;3 seconds;East Tennessee, 3 orb mass in the sky My girlfriend and I were driving down a hill and saw a triangle shaped lights. One large in the middle and 2 smaller balls on the sides, the lights was orange. I couldn’t tell if the lights were jointed together or if they were separate. The object was large with about 1 mile away over a cliff and water. When we saw the orbs in the sky my girlfriend saw the three orbs but I think and not certain but I saw a small white light above the three orbs. Well we were going down the hill and I saw these orbs, and within 3 seconds they had vanished. This was out in a barren field with no street lights and no city lights. The first thing I said was “Look it’s the lights from Preston’s drive way. Oddly enough about 2 years ago I saw a large orange orb in the sky that glowed in the exact same way but when I saw them back then it seemed as if their light was bleeding across the sky.  Well that’s It.;36.538247188755;-82.54081184739

The triangle was East South East and moved to the East, and then moved to the North. All of this happened within a 30-45 second time period.  The triangle had distinct characteristics such as the following: Triangular, Red, Flashing, Rotating. The triangle also moved faster than an aircraft would. I know this because I have lived near an airport my whole life, and this was not an aircraft of U.S.A.;36.538247188755;-82.54081184739
A silent triangle with three white lights on each point with a pulsing red light in the middle moved E to W then slowly toward SW.;2012-11-13 21:20:00;5 minutes;A silent triangle with three white lights on each point with a pulsing red light in the middle moved E to W then slowly toward SW. After returning from watching a movie we (my fiancé and myself) came home. I saw a triangle silently moving across the tree line above my house.  Three white lights on each corner were continuously lit up with a pulsing red light directly in the middle of the 3 white lights. I have an iphone video of the event but only star light shows with our voices captured in the back ground. The object moved east to west then turn slowly toward the south west until I lost sight of it.  A few minutes later what looked like a medical helicopter flew in what looked like the opposite direction of where this silent triangle craft was moving.  The helicopter was visible and very loud unlike the triangle which was silent.;36.538247188755;-82.54081184739
Large light slowly moving toward us that separated into two lights in front of large black triangle completely silent.;2019-11-02 19:00:00;2 minutes;Large light slowly moving toward us that separated into two lights in front of large black triangle completely silent. I want to start by saying that I tried every way I could think of to explain this away but I could not!  What I saw was real I am still not sure what it was but I know it was real.  I have a background in Medicine and business management.  So I deal in facts and figures and I have done this for the last 30 years.  I am not prone to exaggeration as anyone who knows me can tell you .  On the evening of November 2, 2019 around 7 pm a friend of mine and my 7 year old granddaughter were coming home from having dinner out.  As we came down our subdivision hill we saw a big light in the distance.  My friend and I both said what is that?  My friend said it looks like someone’s large outdoor light.  As we got closer I said is that it?  It looks like a really low star.  It started to move toward us very slowly and as it moved the one big light separated into two lights that stayed very close together but kept coming toward us very slowly.  We rolled down the windows to see if it was a plane or a helicopter by chance but it was total silence.  This was the oddest thing to comprehend.   My granddaughter by this time was very scared and started crying for us to move before the police came she thought we were doing something wrong sitting in the road.   She could not understand what was happening.  I put my head out the window to see if I could see it better it was so low it almost touched the trees.  It was a large black triangle shape behind the large lights in the front.  It could not have been a plane it was going to slow and it did not make a sound.  We watched it as it moved slowly toward the trees. As I was driving we could see it in the distance through the trees it seemed to hoover then headed toward the ridge line in the area where we live and then disappeared.  It could have dropped further down in the tree line or was just out of our sight.  I could not really comment on what it did in that area I do not know.  Later that night around 9:30 pm I took my dog out as I usually do, in the distance toward the ridge line above the area where I live there was a smoky looking cloud.  Since it was a clear night I thought that was odd to be there.  Then in the smoky cloud red lights started flashing as if sparklers were going off.  This is the same area that the larger object was heading toward when it disappeared from our sight.  I came inside and told my friend to look out her bedroom window could she see what I was seeing and she did.  This is when we started looking on the internet to see if anyone else that night had seen what we saw.  We could not find anything about it.  The next day Sunday 11-03-2019 I called the local police department to see if anyone had reported anything strange in the sky the night before but no one had reported anything.  I don’t know what we saw but I do know it was not a plane or helicopter.  My daughter said it could be a stealth plane but after research it did not look exactly like one.  I also did not see that a stealth could separate it lights as this object did nor would a stealth have any reason to be in our area.  If anyone has an explanation for this I would appreciate knowing as I have been going back and forth about what I really have seen.  It is hard to comprehend.;36.538247188755;-82.54081184739
