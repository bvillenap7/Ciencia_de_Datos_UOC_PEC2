Cigar shaped and bright white;2005-03-30 19:00:00;about 15-30 seconds;I was outside taking photographs of the sunset and I turned around 180 degrees and I saw a craft (cigar shaped and bright white, almost as if it were silver and reflecting light) that was flying extremely fast and had no signs of having wings and being a man-made craft... I was able to snap 3 pictures of it before it flew off and I couldn't see it anymore due to my house blocking the view of where it went... none of the characteristics you have listed below apply to this sighting at all... it did not leave a trail like the rest of aircraft i could see in the sky that evening, it didn't have lights at all and it seemed to make no sound (but then again it also appeared to be miles away). ((NUFORC Note:  We have examined the photographs, and we do not know what the object is.  It appears to be a very small, white, possibly transparent (or diaphanous), and it appears to move rapidly across the sky, if the estimate by the witness/photographer of how rapidly he snapped pictures is accurate.  We do not know what the object is.  PD));36.538247188755;-82.54081184739
