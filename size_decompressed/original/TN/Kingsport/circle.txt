MUFON/TENNESSEE REPORT:  Object emits lime greel light in a semi-circle along interstate;2004-03-24 04:30:00;30-45 seconds;Object emits lime greel light in a semi-circle along interstate Reported by MUFON ASD Kim Shaffer (tennessee) Reported to me on March 25th, a tanker truck driver was travelling South on Interstate 81, just outside Kingsport. The area is rural, dotted with farms along the highway. Witness states that he was doing about 70 mph when he saw what appeared to him as a semi-circle of lime green blurred lights, decending rapidly in a pasture field along the interstate. The lights appeared ambient to him or that they were emissions from recesses ( he called them stove pipes)and that he was not actually seeing the source of the lights. The lights decended rapidly and stopped some 50 feet from the ground. The lights then became very clear, and clearly arranged in a semi-circular pattern, possibly indicating a round or disc shaped object. The witness could not see any outline of any such craft but the lights seemed to him to be some 50 feet across. At his speed, he saw the lights for only a matter of seconds and was afraid to slow down or stop.

Small white orb flying thru my yard.;2015-09-07 21:00:00;Seconds;Small white orb flying thru my yard. Out in my backyard, a round oval shaped object flew right by me and just disappeared right into the air. White glowing light. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Hi Mr. Davenport, The size of the orb object was a tennis ball.  I was totally shocked to see this but have read the stories on the website that these things were around.  I am setting up a video camera to see if we can catch it if it ever comes back again.  It was a glowing white orb object that floated across the yard to back of neighbors house and it just vanished.  That is all the facts, just been reading the website of what people has seen around us here.  No one else saw it but I called neighbor to go out and he didn't see it at all. I will be out every night looking for this now. We did see another object back in march before I had found your website.  I can draw a picture of that object because I will never forget it.  It was black coming across the sky, triangle shaped, 2 red circles at each end of triangle shape, with white lines connecting the red circles.  No noise was coming from the object, but you could see where it was lit up inside.  It went south toward asheville, nc down interstate 26 and when it reached the point at kingsport tn, it just turned left and went towards virginia.  It did not turn like a plane does in flight, it just turned.  I go out every night to look for this object and then I saw the orb going across my yard. Thanks, ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM));36.538247188755;-82.54081184739

It changed colors and was flashing sometimes a reddish hue but mainly white.  We noticed it moving slightly and then it would move more.  It moves in circles, up and down and side to side.  We noticed that as we watched it had moved farther up from when we originally noticed it.  Quite a sight. Very mesmerizing.;36.538247188755;-82.54081184739
