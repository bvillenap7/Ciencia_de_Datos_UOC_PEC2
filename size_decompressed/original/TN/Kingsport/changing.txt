It was a partly cloudy day at Warriors Path State Park. The Skies were blue and there were large  clusters of clouds throughout the ski. Visibility was good. The object was probably 2 miles away. It stayed in the clouds darting back and forth and changing shapes. It was dark in color and it would fly back and forth in the cloud. At first we thought it was a Hot air balloon but it moved to quickly for that and changed shapes to much for that. It was to big to be some kind of glider or kite or something. It looked like a 50 yard tarp blowing around in the clouds. I said that it looked like a Dragon flying around.;36.538247188755;-82.54081184739
