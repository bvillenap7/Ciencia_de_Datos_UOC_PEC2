Below is the report of my father. He saw this during breakfast on his way to work. I was behind Mc Donald's in the parking lot at Allen Dale eating a ham biscuit.  I was supposed to meet fellow employees at Mc Donalds before going to work.  They were late and I was eating alone.   It was approx 5:30am and it was still dark.  When I noticed a ball of flame shoot over the mountain.  It shot in a straight line then zig zagged and disappeared going south east to south west over top of the mountains. It was directly over the US government installation BAE systems (an aeronautical defense company) located in Kingsport. BAE systems was formerly known as Holston Defense.    The Fireball was the size of a soccer ball in the sky and compared to normal sized stars it did not fit the usual description. It was very large with a piercing bright white and phosphorous glow. The sighting only lasted for a few seconds. I didn't hear anything, and it was too big to be compared to a typical shooting star. It did not travel down towards the earth, but instead It traveled horizontal and then zig zagged until it disappeared.   I do not believe it was a shooting star simply because it did not travel in the expected path of something entering into the earths atmosphere, and it was unusually large. I then continued on to work and did not mention it until this evening around 10pm;36.538247188755;-82.54081184739
