flashing red light turned out to be a soundless spinning disc shape;1978-07-25 21:00:00;5 minutes;flashing red light turned out to be a soundless spinning disc shape Hello.  I want to report something that happened to my neighbor and I years ago at our home.  This was in 1977 or 1978 in Kingsport, TN.  We lived near the area airport and we were used to seeing planes day and night (helicopters were rare, however.)   Our houses shared a driveway and we were out at night playing basketball under a street light my parents had put in.  Our houses were situated along the Interstate 81, which ran across the street from our homes, and there was a steep hill behind us which had no homes back in there, just woods and fields. 	While playing, I noticed a regularly flashing red light was travelling from west to east basically parallel to the Interstate very slowly.  I just gave it a casual notice and didn’t even mention it to my neighbor, and went back to playing.  The light disappeared behind trees and hills in the east.  After a few moments, I noticed it coming back in the opposite direction, and it was travelling a little faster.  Again I just took notice, it was a little odd, but nothing to mention.  It went out of sight to our left (west) and I kept playing.  Well, after a short time (maybe 1 minute) it appeared again, moving faster.  This time I showed my neighbor, and we wondered if it might be some kind of helicopter.  This time after it disappeared to our right, we waited for it to return.  It did so, and was moving rather rapidly.  It was still a steadily flashing red light at this point.  We were excited, and ran up into our back yard to see better, because it let us get uphill above the level of our houses.  As the light travelled from right to left along the Interstate this time, you could tell it was getting closer. This last time, it came pretty close, and the flashing light started to look like maybe it was more of a spinning thing.  There was still no noise from it.  It appeared to curve around a large hill at the left edge of our vies, and then it came out from behind that hill.  It seemed to have changed direction and was coming right toward us.  As it got closer, it was definitely a spinning craft (it was late at night, so the shape of it wasn’t visible) but the lights were either a red-lighted strip with black circles spinning fast, or something round with red-lighted portholes or something similar.  It was moving fast, and dipped below the tree line, but still above the hills.  It suddenly dipped down right behind our house.  No sound at all.  The distance it was at would have made noise very noticeable if it were a helicopter, or a plane.  It was probably only 5 or 6 houses down from ours and up in the air barely above the trees. 	My neighbor and I looked at each other, mouths hanging open.  I think we both said “Did you see that?” at the same time.  We ran into the house to tell people.  The family said the TV had been out, just static (we didn’t have cable), for a minute, but was now back on.  They thought I was crazy, of course.  I knew when I ran in the door that no one would ever believe me.  I had seen another UFO behind that hill before, but that would be another entry, I assume. Thanks.;36.538247188755;-82.54081184739
Flying saucer with multi-colored lights near Kingsport, TN.;1989-04-25 01:00:00;2;Flying saucer with multi colored lights near Kingsport, Tn I was driving home late from school in mid- to late-April 1989.  I had stayed late to work on finals projects and left the college somewhere between 12:30 and 1:00 am.   I proceed West on I-81 and saw something hovering above the trees on the right side of the road at the top of a steep embankment.  When I got closer, I pulled into the emergency lane and looked up the embankment toward the UFO.  There was lights all the way around the bottom of this craft.  I could see the bottom very clearly.  It was only about 300ft up the hill from me hovering about the trees.  It had two or three different colored lights around the outside on the bottom.  The colors where red, white and green or blue. The bottom was shiny like polished aluminum or chrome.  I could not see the upper portion of the craft. 	The craft made no sound and just set there only 30 or 40 ft above the tree tops. It was probably about 100ft in Dia.  I slowed down to a crawl and looked out my passenger side window up at the bottom of the craft.  I was afraid to get out or stop.  There was no car in view in front of or behind me on my side of the interstate.  I could see cars coming on the opposite side of the road.  I only seen the craft for 1-2 minutes but see if very clearly. 	I pulled away slowly and it was still setting there when I left.  It made no sound.   I watched the news the next day several times and evidently no one else reported it.  Some people on the other side of the interstate had to see it.

I saw the disk shaped object in Tennessee also;2013-09-14 17:30:00;Random;I saw the disk shaped object in Tennessee also I was at my grand daughters birthday party at 1730 or 5:30PM today and My mom actually spotted the object first and ask me if if I just seen that I ask what and she pointed to the sky.  The day was beautiful about 76 degrees without a cloud in the sky.  I looked up and seen a circular/disk shaped object silver in color with the glare of the sun against it.  I did not notice any lights on it and didn't make a sound flying very nigh in the sky and thought it may have been a balloon or something floating up but it wasn't floating, it was literally flying at a high rate of speed and as I watched it, the object just disappeared.  I also noticed that there weren't any airplanes in the sky of which I found odd because I was about 2 miles from the airport.  My dad said it may be a military drone, but I have never heard of one that was circular shaped, but anythings possible I guess.  About thirty minutes later it reappeared out of nowhere, then disappeared again. I hope the government isn't covering up something that could put is all in danger.   I ran across this site just to find out if anyone else has seen this thing and was surprised to see this many sightings.  I tried to take photos with my cell phone but they wouldn't show up since it was so high up.;36.538247188755;-82.54081184739
Hovering disk and flashing lights. Very clear.;2014-03-05 20:30:00;5 minutes;Hovering disk and flashing lights.  Very clear. Disk shaped, three solid lights on one side, flashing lights were rotating on ends.   Hovering much closer than any airplane would fly with very slow movement in any direction.   Drove away and turned around, in that split second it was completely gone. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the time reported by the witness is flawed.  We believe that the sighting may have occurred at 8:30 p.m., not a.m., and we have amended the time above.  The witness elects to remain anonymous, and provides no contact information, so we are unable to confirm the time of the sighting.  PD));36.538247188755;-82.54081184739
Large UFO in night sky.;2017-06-29 23:15:00;5 minutes;Large UFO in Night Sky We observed a large disk-shaped craft moving slowly, east to west, at at low altitude, probably 1000 ft above ground.  It followed the path and direction of the Clinch Mountains. It had solid cluster of 3-4 red lights on the front and rear of the craft and it was if the craft was transparent except for the lights.   It was around 500 yards from our rear deck of our house.  No sound, or sharp turns, as it passed by.  The craft was at least a football field in length, very large.   We viewed it from the side until it had passed heading towards Mount Carmel/Church Hill.  It was being followed by 3 aircraft at a much higher altitude.;36.538247188755;-82.54081184739
