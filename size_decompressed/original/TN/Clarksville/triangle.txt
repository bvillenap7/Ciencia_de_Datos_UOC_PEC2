However, I was driving on Interstate 24 West, when I spotted 3 lights in the sky in what appeared to be a triangle type formation.  I thought at first it could be a plane but it was very low, then I thought since being so close to Fort Campbell, it could have been helicopters.  However, this simply was not helicopters.  I heard no noise from it and even rowed my window down to listen.   As I got closer I noticed they were not moving.  It was cloudy so no stars were visible at all. The triangle shaped lights simply seemed to hover in same spot.  I was able to see them for about 3 miles before I passed by them and being on the interstate was not exactly able to just stop.   I am not sure what this was, but it was unlike anything I had ever seen before.  No way I was the only one to see these, interstate was packed with traffic.   Be nice to read another's person's report on this to confirm what I saw.;36.5673523039611;-87.3939784155229

This time I caught it on video. It is listed on YouTube as Monday night lights a 38 second clip, the name of Mike Rogers which is NOT my real name.
