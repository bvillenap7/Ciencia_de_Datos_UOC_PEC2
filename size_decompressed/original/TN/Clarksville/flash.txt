Flashing lights flying very high in the sky appearing and disappearing not a plane.;2015-06-04 03:30:00;5 minutes;Flashing lights flying very high in the sky appearing and disappearing not a plane. I was outside with my daughter when I saw what appeared to be a star flash and then disappear.  Then I noticed two more flashes that appeared farther away.  All three looked like stars.  Then we both saw the same brighter one reappear and flash out again.  It had moved in the sky.  The other more dim ones did the same but at different intervals.   This continued for 5 minutes and then all three just disappeared.  It was very unusual.   My daughter also commented that earlier she had witnessed a bright flash in the western sky near Fort Campbell that was followed by a sizzling sound.  She said she assumed it was a transformer.  But the flashes we witnessed together seemed like something flying very high and not like a plane.;36.5673523039611;-87.3939784155229
