Round saucer shaped craft streaking over the south side of Clarksville TN shining light beams north and to the ground.;2005-08-20 23:45:00;3-5 minutes;Round saucer shaped craft streaking over the south side of Clarksville TN shining light beams north and to the ground. There was a bright flash of light that lit up the area. The flash came from above light at camera flash but lasted about a second or so. There were two objects that streaked from point to point going left to right... north to south. The slowed a bit after crossing the sky. Their form was visiable clearly round disks. Colors changing and then they shot what looked at to be light beams that went on and off The lights were aimed at the ground but an an angle. It looked like they were trying to illuminate an are like they were looking for something. I was coming into Clarksville on 41 at Sango it looked like they were aiming north. Could have been Fort Campbell but I have never seen a round or saucer shape anything in the air around here. Plenty of military air craft but nothing like this. These objects seemed to be in a slight mist or haze.;36.5673523039611;-87.3939784155229
Glowing Disc at Fort Campbell;2017-02-23 17:30:00;2 seconds;Glowing Disc at Fort Campbell It was bright, it was like a glowing disc.  It landed very quickly, it was already on approach when I saw it, coming in to Fort Campbell. I tried to convince myself it was not a UFO.  I tried really really hard.;36.5673523039611;-87.3939784155229
UFO caught with binoculars by 3 people.;2019-04-09 22:00:00;30+ minutes;UFO caught with binoculars by 3 people. 1 craft seen with binoculars, way brighter than all the stars, had lights all around the disk which looked like maybe 6 inches apart, kept hovering for 10+ mins at a time before moving around the sky just a little bit at a time.  There were 6 helicopters in the 30 mins I was out there that kept flying in its direction and that is very unusual.  It was still out there when I went outside but it was a legitimate UFO that I could see with binoculars before it got too far away.;36.5673523039611;-87.3939784155229
