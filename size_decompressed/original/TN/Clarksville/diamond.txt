So a friend and I were going out to my house to pick up a movie I left there because I was staying at his place that night. We left my house at 6-7 and started heading to his place.  I live out in the boondocks so nothing really ever happens, barely any aircraft fly over and its just away from the city (Clarksville, TN). I know Fort Campbell is close but like I said theres never really and light or planes or anything and these weren't going towards Fort Campbell.  So we were driving to his house and saw a bunch of lights that looked like they were under a big awkward looking diamond. At first I thought it was a B-2 but the shape just wasen't right, it was a lot bigger, and it was wider.  It was just hovering there in the sky and then all the lights but 3 turned off and it started picking up speed really fast.  We kept driving and saw 2 more about half a mile away from the first. One of them was flying alittle behind the other and they had their lights off. The one in front took off pretty fast but the one behind just kept going slowly until we couldnt see it anymore once it went past some trees.  Can't really estimate size or height.  All lights were same color, yellow.  The sound was just a dull roar.;36.5673523039611;-87.3939784155229
