A sighting of a craft and alien abduction experience;1978-08-01 22:00:00;4 hours;A sighting of a craft and alien abduction experience I was taking a nap in the evening at the above date.  I was about 6 months pregnant at the time.  I woke up and saw a large craft outside the upstairs window of an A frame structure located in a wooded around.  My husband saw it too.  For some reason I fainted or went out.  I heard a voice with a thick middle eastern accent tell me to open my eyes.  I thought to myself, why would Mark, my husband, tell me to open my eyes. I said no.  The voice said you must.  I finally did after the voice spoke firmly.  What I saw I had never before seen.  It looked like an insect. It was thin and white wearing a dark suite, more like a robe.  It spoke without moving its lips.  I couldn't tell who was talking to me because there was more than one.  The others were wearing jumpsuits. He kept telling me to look at him, but I didn't want to and I kept shutting my eyes.  He said I must not fear him but I kept screaming and hyperventilating.  He kept saying he would not harm me and I must believe that.  He kept looking closely in my eyes or at my pupils.  I asked him what he was .  Was he a snake ?  He said no, I am not a reptile.  Then I asked if he were a insect.  He told me to look at his arms and said something about his joints and were they like an insect?  I asked him if he were going to kill me or eat me.  He said,  Why? do you think you would taste good?  This may sound like I am joking, but truly I am not. I kept screaming and shutting my eyes.  I was on some sort of table, I know, your classic alien experience.  The others around me starting backing away. The taller alien, the one in the robe told them That is the fear, that is the fear you smell.  It was awful.  I kept going in and out and I was afraid for my baby.  They of course, took a long needle and stuck it in my belly button.  It hurt worse than anything I had ever felt.  It told them it hurt and one of the little mean things put his hand over my eyes.  I must have fainted because the pain went away.  When I awoke or whatever again I saw the one in the robe talking to another one.  Their backs were turned to me so I figured what have I got to lose.  I made fun of the back of their heads and told them they looked like basket balls.  ONe said, You are making fun of us?  I said Yes.  I want to go. He said not yet.  There was much more but this is hard to talk about and I need to stop now.  There were helicopters around the ship when I first saw them before I was awakened.  I will detail this later.;36.5673523039611;-87.3939784155229
Clarksville, Tn UFO sighting.;2009-02-15 09:45:00;15 minutes;Clarksville, Tn UFO sighting. On 02/15/09 I left work in Springfield, Tn. I got on hwy 24 headed to Clarksville, Tn. Around exit 19 the car in front of me started slowing down. I looked up and saw two red lights and a green light off in the distance. The lights caught my attention because they were not moving. As I drove closer to the lights the craft got bigger and it was circular  with red and green lights on it. It seemed to come down closer to us. The car in front of me pulled over, I kept going but every one around me was stopping and getting out. I kept driving as the craft got closer it was very big and dark silver the lights did not blink or it did not seem to move it was like it was standing still. I kept driving I looked up as I past it and it seemed to glow brighter. I drove past  maybe seven cars stopped and people out of them or just sitting there watching. Since I was alone I did not stop. It was not a plane or helicopter. I have never seen a UFO or claimed to but this was one.;36.5673523039611;-87.3939784155229

It was motionless for a few seconds then dropped about 1 foot then back up, then dropped straight down very very fast.  everything moved at the same time.  I have reported this to mufon.  I served my car at the end because I have never ever seen anything so HUGE in the air, it was basically right there.;36.5673523039611;-87.3939784155229
