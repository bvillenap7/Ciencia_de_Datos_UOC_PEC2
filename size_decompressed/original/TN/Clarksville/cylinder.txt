Very large cylindrical craft that resembles molten lava at low altitude traveling Northwest of Clarksville, TN;2014-05-26 21:30:00;3 minutes;Very large Cylindrical craft that resembles molten lava at low altitude traveling Northwest of Clarksville, TN I was driving from Pleasant View, TN, to Clarksville on my way home.  As I drove on 101st Airborne Division Parkway, near Trenton Rd., I noticed an object to my left that was getting larger in appearance.  My first thought was the planet Mars (red spherical shape at a distance).  It was a clear night, and slightly windy.   As I kept driving, I eventually stopped at the intersection on Trenton Rd.  As I looked again at the object.  I was now slightly to my left rear of my vehicle much larger.  It was a breath-taking sight due to its size and shifting colors it was emitting.  The shape of the craft reminded me of a blimp but elongated.  The whole craft reminded me of looking at a jellyfish in the ocean, but in the air.   It was emitting bright colors were of a molten red and yellowish that almost gave it a molten lava like texture.  The whole crafts luster reminded me of looking at a crystal with a light shining through it (gave it a heavenly appearance to it).  There were no sound coming from the craft except the wind and vehicles driving by.   I would have to say the craft was at least several hundred feet from the ground, and perhaps a distance from my vehicle of no less than half a mile away (moving towards Fort Campbell (traveling Northwest).;36.5673523039611;-87.3939784155229
