Big, Fast, bright and soundless light;2005-07-25 22:00:00;about 1 min;Big, Fast, bright and soundless light On July 25, 2005 around 10pm, I saw the most beautiful light fly across and above me. Every evening just about the same time I walk my dog. But this time I saw something that I never seen before and I still can't explain what it could of being.  I noticed a very bright light reflecting all around me. I automatically looked up to see what it was. I didn't get to see how it started it. All I know is that it was nice and dark and out of no where everything got really bright.  It started flying from the left side to the right on a straight line. Never flew up or down, never changed direction. This didn't look at all like a falling star. This light was very close to me, I would say about 1 and half to two telephone poles tall. From this distance it looked to be the size of a basketball or a little bigger.  The only thing I can describe it to is a ball of fire flying super fast. But, the light that it was emitting didn't look like fire at all. Picture a basketball on fire flying to one direction at a high speed, the flames thickly trailing behind. But instead of being fire it was all light. It got brighter and brighter as it picked up speed till it disappeared with no trails or sound.  The color in the center was so bright it looked almost white. The closer it got to the surface the more yellow it looked the actual surface was a bright electric blue. The light was leaving a thick trail, as it got to the end it was small yellow sparks.  It flew about 150 to 200 feet, when it disappeared. This happened in about a minute with no sound what so ever.  I made a drawing to help you understand what I'm talking about, hope it help. ((name deleted));36.5673523039611;-87.3939784155229
Pulsing light in the night sky;2006-06-13 22:00:00;2 minutes;Pulsing light in the night sky My daughter and I were sitting on our deck when we noticed a bright white light moving from North to South across the sky, it was moving very fast,no sound, no blinking lights, and it suddenly dimmed then disappeared!  While we were still looking we noticed another bright white light moving from South to the North.  As we watched the light started to dim, and we thought it would disappear too, but then it pulsed a very bright white light, started going dim again, then about 5 seconds later pulsed again.  It did this for about a minute, pulsing on and off while moving very fast across the sky until it disappeared completely. I'm using the word pulse instead of flash because the light, when it happened, would pulse on very slowly, not like a harsh flash, and then slowly dim. This was a very clear night. We saw normal aircraft that night and noted that they were all flying much lower than these 2 objects.;36.5673523039611;-87.3939784155229
Saw lights towards  Hopkinsville, KY, there were about 10 of them;2009-06-30 21:00:00;10 minutes;Saw lights towards  Hopkinsville, KY, there were about 10 of them We were standing outside and noticed something flash across the sky faster than a plane towards Hopkinsville, KY.  At first we all thought it was a shooting star, but noticed that it just stayed in one spot.  Other planes were flying close to it, but it just sort of stayed in one spot, then as soon as the planes would pass, it would start to move again.  The object went behind a neighbor's house slowly, so we all followed it to see what it was going to do.  It disappeared rather quickly. We went back to where we initially saw it and noticed that the stars that were in the sky all around it were gone as well. Later on one of the witnesses said that when her mother had come to visit earlier this year, she had seen the same sort of thing as well. Nobody believed her then, but now we all do.

Fast moving light over larksville Tn;2010-08-23 04:00:00;45 seconds to One minute;Fast moving light over clarksville Tn Around 4 am Sunday morning my friends and I were hanging out at my apartment when the power went out.  We then decided to go outside and use the brief period of lower light pollution to observe the stars.   After being outside for about 3 minutes one of my friends saw a shooting star.  Directly after he saw the shooting star he ushered us to look in that direction and when we did the three of us saw a light moving south-southwest away from Fort Cambell army base.   Only seconds after we saw the light we noticed a plane moving in the direction that the light disappeared on the horizon.  The light was very bright, way brighter than any star out that night.  And it appeared to move in a curving motion at one point before returning to a straight path and moving very very fast across the sky.   We only saw it for about 45 seconds.

two orange lights side by side with what can only be described as a orangish red comet tail shooting down from the sky very low;2021-08-30 22:30:00;2 seconds;Walked out my front door and saw two orange lights side by side with what can only be described as a orangish red comet tail shooting down from the sky very low over my neighbors house across the street. We see things like this all the time but much higher in the sky. This one was very low and just disappeared;36.5673523039611;-87.3939784155229
