A bright UFO jumps out of a wormhole/portal and possibly abducts a young man;2006-12-04 04:00:00;02:00;A bright UFO jumps out of a wormhole/portal and possibly abducts a young man  500 Lights On Object0: Yes I believe in 2006 I was abducted by extraterrestrials in Clarksville,Tennessee in the early morning hours of early December around 3:30 or 4:30am. I was asleep in my room then awoke and felt like I immediately needed to get up and do something so I got up to go smoke a cigarette in my garage because it had been cold outside for the past two weeks but as I got closer to the garage door I heard a voice in my head say &quotYOU NEED TO GO OUTSIDE&quot So, I said speaking a pond what I had just heard&quotYOUR RIGHT LET ME GO OUTSIDE&quot so I turned around and went out my back door and as I stepped out the door I noticed that the sky was crystal clear it appeared as if every star in the sky was visible. As I looked to the left I saw what appeared to be something like a rainbow it was purple and pink and it sat right above a tall tree in my neighbor's back yard. It looked like a snakes body when it slithers but not going from West to East but from South to Nor! th above the tall tree and it also appeared as if it was transparent so I said to my self thinking what is that I've never seen that before. Then I looked off to the right of me still scanning the sky hoping I would see a UFO but I didn't so I turned back to look at the strange colors thinking I'm going to watch whatever this is to see if it disappears or fades away and as soon as my eyes locked on the strange colors a circular ball of light surrounded by a neon green and blue gas or plasma substance which stayed around the helicopter sized craft the entire time shot out at super sonic speed and made a complete stop the craft hovered for app 10 seconds and then started to move really really slow to the right of me for about 7 to 10 seconds before shooting off in super sonic speeds without making a sound and left behind 6 circles that look like smoke rings with lines in between each of them. As I turned my head the object appeared to be coming back in the opposite direction ! except this time it appeared to be far out with the stars and ! traveled out as far as I could see within 5 seconds so by this time i was crying like a baby because I couldn't believe what had just happen to me so I stepped up on my stairs to the house and looked up to the sky and asked &quotGOD IF THAT WAS MEANT FOR ME AND IF YOU MEANT FOR ME TO SEE THAT WOULD YOU PLEASE SHOW ME ANOTHER SIGN? And as soon as I said that a smaller circular ball of light flew right over my house lower than the UFO with noun of the same characteristic as the UFO except for how bright and illuminated they both were.  couldn't handle it any more so while still crying and in complete shock I went in my room and laid down and felt such a sense of peace that I had a smile on my face from ear to ear and it felt like I was dying and leaving my body then I blacked out within a minutes or less saying oh my GOD oh my GOD. Then I woke up around 10:30am the next morning looking around thinking OK I'm in my room and I jumped up thinking to my self oh my GOD that really did happen to me last night so while in the shower I felt a bump underneath my right arm pit and quickly got out the shower to look at whatever it was knowing that it hadn't been there the morning before or months before or years prior to the event that took place last night. The bump appeared to have a oval black burn mark in the center. The bump went down after two years but now you can clearly see a whole and what appears to be an object perfectly placed in the center where the black mark once was. It is still underneath my arm as ! of this day and it is going on 6 years now. It appeared as if I was burnt by a laser or injected with a hot needle at first but now it appears as if I was implanted with something that Dr Roger Leir studies but it has never caused me any discomfort. All I want is some help so I can understand what happen to me that night. This is my honest to GOD truth. I also have a picture of the mark that's underneath my arm and two picture's I took of a UFO on my birthday March 27 of 2009;36.5673523039611;-87.3939784155229
Oval fireball hover and headed north over clarksviile, tn;2010-07-05 19:30:00;5 min;Oval fireball hover and headed north over clarksviile, tn I'm in the military and in air defense and live next to a military base.  I've been a 14s for 7 years now and I'm able to define aircrafts clearly.  What me and my family had wittnesed was not like any aircraft I have ever seen. We saw one object in the sky that was oval shape that looked like it was on fire.  The object moved slowley across the sky headed in a north direction.  As the object got further it no longer looked to be on fire and was a soild black apperence.  My wife who is a college student and my 11 year old daughter had wittnessed the event.;36.5673523039611;-87.3939784155229
Unidentified object in distance during an electrical storm in Clarksville, TN.;2014-07-25 20:30:00;30 minutes;Unidentified object in distance during an electrical storm in Clarksville, TN. While photographing an evening lightning storm, I captured an image of a craft that I cannot explain.  At the time, I did not know the craft was present in the distance, it was not discovered until the following day while I was looking at and editing my pictures for content and color. Initially, I thought that I had captured an extremely bright star, but as I zoomed in on the object, it appeared to be below the thunder/lightning and clouds.  It seemed to stay stationary and or keep pace with the clouds. Yes, the picture do appear to be edited, only to the point of adjusting some colors in order to bring out the object in as much detail as I possibly can.  The originals are still intact and unedited, but they are harder to see and make out the object in question.;36.5673523039611;-87.3939784155229
