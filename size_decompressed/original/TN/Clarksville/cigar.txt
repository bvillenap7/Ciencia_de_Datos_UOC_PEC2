Bright lights moving through the sky at alarming speeds.;2017-03-10 20:30:00;15 minutes;Bright lights moving through the sky at alarming speeds Went outside to my car to retrieve something when I noticed three bright lights above me.  I watched the lights cross cross one another.  I returned upstairs on my back porch and watched the lights fly around for about ten minutes.  It was partly cloudy so when the craft broke through the clouds I saw the shape of the craft before it took off at a alarming speed.  All crafts were silent and moving all around the wooded area around my house for a total of 15 minutes then they took off in the night sky.
