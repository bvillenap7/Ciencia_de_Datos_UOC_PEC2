Multiple cluster of lights (more than eight) in an arc appear momentarily for roughly 30 seconds at night.;2003-12-02 00:45:00;30 seconds;Multiple cluster of lights (more than eight) in an arc appear momentarily for roughly 30 seconds at night. While driving home from work, I was nearing the Interstate overpass near Exit 4, just outside of Clarksville, TN (heading into town), I observed a number of lights beginning to appear.  Shaped in somewhat of an arc, there were more than 8 of these lights.  All white in color, and clustered close together.  It almost appeared to be an effect of something breaking through cloud cover.  The brightness was intense.  The object(s?) did not appear to move as I had pulled over to the side of the road to watch from a stationary vantage point.  The object(s?) were stationary during their entire appearance.  And just as they had appeared all at once, they went out in the same fashion.  The direction I observed these/this object(s?) was towards the Fort Campbell, KY side of Clarksville.  Although I would guess that the distance was not far enough away to place it on the post.  This could have been maybe up to 4 miles away from my position.  As to the size, I'm guessing VERY VERY LARGE.;36.5673523039611;-87.3939784155229
In the night sky I saw an object that looked like the pontoons on a pontoon boat, except that one was aligned ahead of the other.;2004-12-09 07:30:00;3 minutes;In the night sky I saw an object that looked like the pontoons on a pontoon boat, except that one was aligned ahead of the other. In the early evening (full dark) I was walking the dogs in a soybean field near our home.  On turning to go back to the car I saw an object shaped like the pontoons on a pontoon boat, except that one was aligned ahead of the other.  It was neon green and descending near the SW horizon.  Suddenly a patch of field near me was brightly illuminated.  I became frightened and hurried to the car.  We returned home without incident.  The next day we saw in the paper the object photographed by Carrie Devorah over Washington, DC.  It was the same, except the object she photographed was blue and ascending.  I am sixty-two years old, an attorney admitted to the bar in five states, and have never seen nor reported a UFO before this occasion.  We live within five miles of Ft. Campbell army post (101st Airborne), and about four miles from a little-used municipal airfield.;36.5673523039611;-87.3939784155229
A camouflage cloaking invisibility technology.;2014-01-18 20:00:00;10 minutes;A camouflage cloaking invisibility technology. My girlfriend and I was walking in a parking lot on Riverside Dr. across from the marina.  She grabbed my arm and asked, if I see that, looked up skeptical and focused.   I couldn't believe what I was seeing.  The ship or whatever it was, was slowly flying hidden right out in the open.  Somehow it used a cloaking device that showed the stars and sky above it was underneath it.  This thing was the size over a football field, like an aircraft carrier flying in the wide open sky undetected.  A silhouette of this thing in the sky.  If my girlfriend wouldn't of been staring at the stars, I'd missed it. I missed the front details, but I seen the sides and the rear of it.  It kind of was shaped like a broken knife blade.  The rear was triangular and had 3 big rings appearing to be a propulsion system.  Flew over slowly about 10 minutes until it flew out of sight. It was troubling seeing something so massive being hidden in our country our world.  No stories of anything, almost.....my girl and i seen through their invisible cloak.  I have no idea what they are doing, why the secrecy?  Are they just observing and friendly or hostile. We have been secretly watched throughout time, but not always secrectly.  Ancient gods & angels I believe was aliens.  This UFO was massive and flew over a city pretty much undetected.;36.5673523039611;-87.3939784155229

As we were walking through the parking lot, my girlfriend grabs my arm out of fear.  Me, I am looking all around the lot and see nothing.  I ask, What's wrong with you? and she points in the sky.   I stare and didn't see anything at first.  Then I notice it!  This massive object, as big as 2 or 3 football fields, a huge ship.  This thing had some kind of cloaking device, where you couldn't really see it.  It was transparent and didn't make a sound.  It's amazing how she was able to see it and point it out to me.  Once you focused on it, you could see the edges of the craft and it was massive.   I felt fear because it was so big and was out in plain sight, but was so unnoticeable.  This thing was as big as an ocean liner, more quiet than the wind, and was invisible, yet flew barley above the trees right through town.   A few little clouds it used to help keep it undetected.  I will never forget that night and it's the only thing my ex and I agree on. SCARY, what are they doing and why?  Obviously we stand no chance if they become hostel.  Technology way beyond anything that we are capable of. HUGE...RIGHT OUT IN THE OPEN...COMPLETELY SILENT...UNDETECTED! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));36.5673523039611;-87.3939784155229
Lights in the sky.;2017-03-10 20:30:00;10 minutes;Was going to my car to retrieve something, when I noticed three lights in the sky, flying close to one another.  The lights then proceeded to crisscross one another (far too close together to be a aircraft).   I went inside and got my husband and son and we watched the lights for about 7 minutes.  The lights shined through the clouds.  I tried to dismiss it as possible spotlights, until the object broke through the clouds and it was a craft I have never seen before.  Moved very quickly and quietly.   Eventually they flew off and I have not seen the lights since. (Have video evidence)   The animals in the neighborhood were also going nuts during this event and it ceased when the objects left.;36.5673523039611;-87.3939784155229
