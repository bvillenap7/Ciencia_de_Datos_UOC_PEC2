I was walking my dog and drizzing and very heavy cloud cover, looked up and saw 4 seperate points of white light.  Bright enough to break through heavy cloud cover, they would be at 4 corners and then would loop and 2 would twirl around each other and then go around and back again.  Of course i'm thinking this is some laser light show and watched for 10 minutes, started to go back up the road and then it started moving off and going into heavier cloud cover.  I was having problems tracking because of trees in way at this point, went inside to get another witness, went back outside and of course nothing was there.  Hopefully someone else was looking up at this time and will report something. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible advertising lights, we suspect.  PD));36.5673523039611;-87.3939784155229
Silent bright blue flash disrupts electrical service in neighboorhood near military installation.;2007-01-28 20:30:00;Less than 1 second;Silent bright blue flash disrupts electrical service in neighboorhood near military installation. Power had gone out throughout neighborhood twice within 3 minutes.  I was looking west from my residence toward Fort Campbell military installation and observed a bright blue flash, similar to lightning in intensity and appearance at horizon level.  There was no sound with the flash.  At that instant, the power in the neighboorhood went out again. The sky was clear horizon to horizon. Local police were called, but refused to investigate. In total, power was lost for ten minutes with three outages in a twelve minute time span.  This was determined by time difference between battery powered kitchen wall clock and clock on electric stove.;36.5673523039611;-87.3939784155229
Blue and Red color changing light Strange movements inconsistent with Conventional A/C;2013-10-18 19:45:00;45 seconds;Blue and Red color changing light Strange movements inconsistent with Conventional A/C One aircraft sighted North-North East of Chardea Dr.  Object appeared at first to be a helicopter or airplane with blue and red lights.  Unable to recognize shape due to distance.   Aircraft was moving Northwest perpendicular to viewpoint, once it began making direction changes it was very apparent it was not a conventional aircraft.  It appeared to change direction towards viewpoint on Chardea Dr. in a manner that was not consistent with laws of physics.  As it got closer it also did not appear to become larger like an object should.  It made a few more strange movements while changing from red to blue light and visa versa.  After a short time it began to move away in a parallel direction to the North East where it rapidly dropped below the horizon.  Entire event once noticed to exiting field of view was approximately 45 seconds.;36.5673523039611;-87.3939784155229

The first time I was outside and it looked metallic with something spinning in the middle.  There were 8-10 visible lights which was why I was curious and it was silent.  The lights were red and white, although I did see other colors (green),  I thought it was maybe too far away and I couldn't make it out well enough.... the next night I ran inside to get my boyfriend who had assured me the night before it had to be a plane, this time he got a closer look and during our observation we watched a minimum of 3 of them.  They hovered, moved seemingly slow and then one just disappeared before our eyes, like it just blinked out and was gone.   Again the next night there was another formation of 3.   My daughter was also shaken recently when she said she saw a silver ball in the sky that just disappeared as well.;36.5673523039611;-87.3939784155229
Small light in the sky suddenly changes directions and zig zags with high speed.;2014-10-26 21:30:00;10 seconds;Small light in the sky suddenly changes directions and zig zags with high speed. Was outside looking at stars and saw what i thought was a satelite traveling east to west, no flashing lights suddenly it stopped midair, reversed direction for a short distance, zigzagged side to side for a moment. I ran to get my husband, and when i returned, it was gone.;36.5673523039611;-87.3939784155229
