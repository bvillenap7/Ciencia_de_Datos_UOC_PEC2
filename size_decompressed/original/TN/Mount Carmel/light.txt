Visiting my first cousin, we were looking up at his vinyl siding.  I noticed what looked exactly like sunlight reflecting off a shiny airplane, except that it was moving way too fast.  If it were an airplane, it was at a VERY high altitude, judging from the relative size.  It appeared to split in two, attempted to rejoin, and grew fainter as it neared the horizon and vanished.  It was moving almost perfectly due East.  All this occured in ten seconds or less. It was a clear sunny day, with no major fronts moving through.;36.5665;-82.6555
