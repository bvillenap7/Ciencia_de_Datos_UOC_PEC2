Unlikely it was a craft, but have not seen a celestial object emit this type of variable light and change shape. Was seen in the low western sky, and dipped below our horizon but not at the same rate as the earth's rotation. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness might have been observing vivid twinkling star, which currently can be seen in the western sky during evening hours.  PD));36.212616777883;-85.5334339370834

Siteing of aircrafts with flashing lights. We were outside to view meteor shower.  Could hear a noise like a machine.  Noise started from distance and moved closer but could not see an object with that noise.  It sounded like it was right above.  Scarey!!;36.212616777883;-85.5334339370834
