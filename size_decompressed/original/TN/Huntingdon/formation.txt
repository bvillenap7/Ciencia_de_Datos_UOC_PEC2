Latitude: 35.69867. Longitude: -88.835306:  At first, there were three reddish orange glowing round lights, and then a fourth orange light came up and joined the first three.  When the fourth orange light caught up with the other three lights, then they all vanished.  No sound heard from any of the objects.  The night was clear.  Temp of the air was about 35 degrees f.  The objects came from the South to the North across the sky.  Age of observer 60.  Glasses were on at the time of the sighting.  The observer does not drink, smoke, or take medication.  Occupation is a teacher.  No aircraft was in the vicinity of the four objects.  The light appeared to be the objects instead of lights being on the objects.  Objects left no trail or haze.  The objects did not emit other objects, beams, or changed colors.  To my knowledge, the objects did not land.  Not a close encounter.  Did not see any animals to determine if they responded to the event. I was able to start my vehicle and drive home without incident.   I thought maybe heli! copters, but they make noise.  Then I felt small planes, but they make noise.  Next, I thought to hang gliders, but they moved to quickly. Then I thought lighted lanterns, but these moved together in a formation as if being directed by other than just wind.  Another thought was drones.  If that were the case, they would have to be huge to be seen from my location.;36.006;-88.4252
