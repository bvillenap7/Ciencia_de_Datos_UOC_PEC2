On the night of July 25th, 2005, my wife and I stepped outside our home in Huntingdon TN.  It was a clear night and the stars were visible in the sky.  As we talked, she noticed a bright fluorescent light shining down to the front yard on the grass.  She said “what is that light?” I looked and followed the light up into the sky until I was looking almost straight up.  At that moment the light in the front yard that had been 150’ away, suddenly flashed all around us, when it did I saw the outline of a craft of some sort.  The light had been projected to the ground from this object.  It was no more than 200’ from the ground and made no noise what so ever.  As soon as I made out the shape of the object it went dark and disappeared from our sight.  I asked my wife to turn off the porch light so we could see better.  When the light was out there was no sign of the craft and we gazed at a clear night sky.  I went directly in the house and drew an illustration of what I had seen.  My wife never looked up so all she saw was the incredible bright fluorescent light all around us. She describes it as an enormous camera flash. Here is my drawing of the craft.;36.006;-88.4252
