Driving northbound on Lewisburg, 3 ½ miles south of 840.  Routine route.  First saw a bright green light which appeared far out to the left of a long straight shot of road, with a smaller blinking red.  Approximately a 3/4 mile closer, and I had ruled out airplane/helicopter, per my trajectory.  Another quarter mile and I slowed while passing it.  I appeared to be fully stationary around 35-40 ft off the ground, above and slightly to the right of a house that sits directly on Lewisburg.  The object was probably no more than 100ft away. It was completely dark out, with no noticeable lights coming from any of the surroundings.  I barely had time to scry its silhouette, but it appeared to be roughly cigar-proportioned, but with more geometric angles with a tip pointing towards the road.  There were two weaker, blinking white lights that started on the small face towards me which angled down around its underbelly geometrically.  The green and red lights seemed to be pointing horizontally or upward, I can’t recall.  I’m thinking it was around 12 (length) x 4 x 4 ft. hard to tell.  No sound that I could hear over the car motor. There were no powerlines, or any other objects around, it was clearly above any trees.  The only explanation I could even begin to consider were two or more drones flying in sync, so that I mistook the “length”.  However, the lights (green especially) were so strong that no drone could sustain that kind of power, let alone waste it by pointing main lights anywhere but downward.;35.8094;-86.8897000000001
