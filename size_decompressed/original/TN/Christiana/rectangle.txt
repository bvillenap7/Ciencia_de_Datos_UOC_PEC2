I witnessed a elongated, triangular shaped object glide/float across a nearly full moon.;2000-01-16 01:30:00;5 min.;I witnessed a elongated, triangular shaped object glide/float across a nearly full moon. While standing on the back deck of my home, which is on the South side of the house.(the house sits perfectly facing North) At approx. 1:30 AM I witnessed a elongated, triangular shape glide or float across my view of the moon from roughly a SW to NE heading. I am located at roughly 35.717N Latitude/-86.5060W Logitude. The moon at this point was roughly 75-85 degrees from my field of view and I was facing SE. This object glided eerily and slowly. Each point of the triangle was covered in vapor or cloud-like material and the object was translucent. As the object crossed my view of the moon, it obscured the moon as if looking at heat waves down an asphalt highway during the summer months, but the moon was still visible. I also detected a faint oscillating or sound pressure alternating sensation in my ears. The wind was blowing gently that night as well. It was a partially cloudy early morning and particularly cool, approx. 45 degrees. I didn't report this incident earlier as I had dismissed it as an illusion of the elements (clouds, moisture, temperature) but after seeing Eric Martin's GIF animation, that's (more or less) exactly what I experienced, except not against a starfield specifically, but against the sky as it was that morning. I don't necessarily have a need to be contacted, I just wanted the data to be included. I have no objection though and I'll leave that up to whom it may concern. Thanks.;35.6949;-86.3723
