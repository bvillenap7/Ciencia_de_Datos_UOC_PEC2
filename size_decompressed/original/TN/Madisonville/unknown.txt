All night Dec 21 - 22 Yellowish white, and blueish white. I was driving down a back road in the country when I saw multiple aircraft in the sky, half could be recognized as human make by the colors of the lights.  The remainder I myself could not explain. At first they seemed like stars, blending in until we went around curves in the road and they had... moved. Almost like they were following us, they were shaped almost like a V and the light coming off them was flashing.  Really fast and almost un-noticeable. We stopped to get out and look to see what it was and they started moving.  Left to right, at first, then in other patterns. I could easily tell that the human aircrafts' were in some kind of formation because they were all kind of close together but the others I could barely distinguish from bigger stars.  The next night (Dec. 22) I saw these same stars, but in totally different places in the sky.  Almost like they followed me home.  (My home is on the far side of town from the first sighting) It's hard to explain!  all of this typing but this is the best I can really do at this moment.;35.488;-84.3321
