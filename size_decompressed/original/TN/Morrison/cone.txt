I looked up and saw this cone shaped light with a tail of light on each side Extremely bright Falling fast straight down I lost sight for just about a minute and when I topped the hill and had a clear view I was afraid it might already be down but there it was stopped in the sky I couldn't see any movement at all I sat at the stop sign for about 4 more minutes and it did not move. Cars came up behind me and I had to leave without seeing the departure.;35.6047;-85.9175
