Blue-green light in east sky moving in pattern;2020-01-22 20:00:00;20 minutes;Blue-green light in east sky moving in pattern Saw a very peculiar thing in the eastern night sky, around 8 pm Tuesday night about five miles north of Ripley TN.  Was clear and cold with tons of stars visible.  A single bluish - green light, not blinking, was quickly tracing a daisy shape in the sky.  Repeated the same pattern for about twenty minutes.  Unable to determine size or distance but was as bright as surrounding stars.  Rural area with trees in all directions around highway 51 so I don't think it was a drone (my first guess);35.7485999999999;-89.5352999999999
