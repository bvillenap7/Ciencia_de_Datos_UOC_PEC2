Bright flashing light in the sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a sighting of the star, Sirius.  PD));2018-03-13 20:00:00;2 days (2 hours each);Bright flashing light in the sky On 03/13/18 and 03/14/18, my wife and I saw a light to the SW/W direction.  The light was unusually bright and changed colors:  Red, White, Blue, Green, and purple.  The object was semi-stationary, moving only slightly over time and not with stars or aircraft.  It moved in abnormal directions such as up and down to its original position or diagonally and back to its original position.  The lights were very prominent, aircraft moving in the general area moved quite differently and had obvious differences in appearance.  Cross reference to star charts and visible planets showed no objects expected to be in the area.the object stayed put for about two hours then suddenly moved towards the direction of Orion's bottom right star and disappeared.   This event happened two night in a row in the same manner.  We noticed our dogs taking notice as well and acting differently from usual.;35.7806;-87.4753
