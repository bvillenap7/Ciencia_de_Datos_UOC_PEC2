All equidistant and following the same trajectory. A friend saw one light, pointed it out, and a debate ensued about whether it was a plane or satellite.  It was a white light that did not blink, and was moving very quickly across the sky. No noises observed.  As we concluded it was most likely a satellite, we then saw it was followed by an identical light.  The second light was then followed by 9 more of the same.  They followed the same trajectory and were exactly equidistant.;36.2756;-87.0425
