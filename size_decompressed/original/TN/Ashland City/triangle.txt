I was hunting in the Cheatham County Wildlife Mgt. Agency. I was walking up a footpath/road about 30' wide. I looked up to my right and saw a huge triangular shaped craft passing parallel to my position. I had a pair of 8x30 binoculars and started viewing it with them.  It was flying west and the sun was reflecting on the huge nose area and the leading edge of the wings and the area was smooth and rounded and was sand colored.  The underneath was shaded and grayish colored.  I seen no lights or windows.  It made a very faint jet sound.  It was leaving a very thick contrail.  I lost sight of it as it flew into the sun and the trees got in the way.  I then faced east and could see another one coming on the same flight path but closer to me.  Again I used my binoculars.  As it passed overhead and past me, I go a good look at the rear of the ship.  There was no tail and the rear of the ship looked very complicated.  I could see two rows of engines or exhausts where the very thick contrails was coming from.  There appeared to some kind of housing area around the exhaust areas and I saw a large strobing light on each side of the housing area.  There also appeared to be some type of louvered areas.  The top side of the back of the ship overhung the exhaust area and the bottom of the ship.  It is hard to estimate the altitude as this aircraft was HUGE!! It pretty much filled up my binoculars at times. Addendum:  I saw two huge triangular aircraft leaving contrails. this is a report of additional information on an earlier report made 11-20-00. I went back to the location and got a gps location of 36 degrees 09.41 west by 087 degrees 04.43 west at an elevation of approx. 760 feet.  I estimate the craft were flying at approx. 5000 ft with a wing span of approx. 1000 feet.;36.2756;-87.0425

I left the Petro 2 truck stop in Kingston Springs, Tn at 4:00am on July 31,2005.   I decided to take the quick way home instead of taking the interstate.  I was on hywy 249 north, it is a winding road but it takes only half the time to get home the evening was still it was alittle foggy driving along the river.  There was a half moon and a few stars out.   I reached the end of hywy 249, I made a right turn on hywy 49E.  As I made this right hand turn I was entering on the bridge there was this big triangle shaped 7 light object that looked hazy hovering over the treeline. I pulled the emergency brake on my car I got out of my vehichle and stood in front of this object for about 1minute and a half.  It was amazing.   I was scared and excited at the same time.  I have never experienced anything like that ever.;36.2756;-87.0425
