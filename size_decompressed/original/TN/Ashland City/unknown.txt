Bright light hovering above tree line;2008-05-08 00:00:00;15 minutes;Bright light hovering above tree line I got up on this morning at 4:30 a.m. to go to the bathroom.  I went into my girls room to check on them and when I did, I saw out the back window a bright light hovering over the trees in the back yard.  The trees are approximatly 50 yards from the back of the house.  I then went outside and observed the light moving slowly back and forth across the tree line.  I'm not sure how long it remained there because after watching it for 15 minutes I realized I needed to get back to bed.  I don't believe it was a helicopter because I could not hear roters at that time.  Contact on this or the previous report I submitted is okay, through email.  No phone calls please.

Strange lights from behind clouds;2008-07-13 22:30:00;30 seconds;Strange lights from behind clouds My 11 year was up and looked out at the night sky.  She says that the 4 objects came from behind the clouds from beside the moon and two of them had white lights, two were orange in color and had 3 orange lights down the side.  She said that they flew very fast across the night sky.  She was not able to see what size they were. When my husband contacted the sheriff's department in our area, the officer answering the phone did not sound surprised.  He said that there was a similar report 3 weeks earlier in the southern part of our county. My 11 year old is very reliable, she does not lie and would have no reason to make something like this up.;36.2756;-87.0425
