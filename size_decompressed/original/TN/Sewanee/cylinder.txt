A glowing cylinder;2001-11-17 21:00:00;4 seconds;A glowing cylinder I was on the mountain visiting friends that night.I went to the car to get a pack of cigarettes and I looked up and saw an orangish redish glowing cylinder,like a glowing ember in the fire.The glowing did not go past the edges of the cylinder and on either end it was rounded.It came down at about an eighty degree angle and flew downside the mountain and then leveled off at the foot and flew parallel to the valley and went about a half mile and then disappeared.It was heading west.There was no sound.I was fairly close to this and I think it was the length of a school bus.;35.2051;-85.913
