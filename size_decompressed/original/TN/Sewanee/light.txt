Three amber lights moving up and down at the tree line.;2013-09-28 22:50:00;15 minutes;Three amber lights moving up and down at the tree line. Just saw three rich amber lights with an occasional flame-like orange flying low in the northern sky just above the tree line.  They were not fireballs, but lights of a color we have never seen in the sky.  They did not flash, or dim, or brighten.  They were right at the tree line and would dip down below the trees and then come back up, moving slowly.  Two of them were closer together and the third more towards the west.  They were the size of peas at arms length. They could have been in the sky longer than the time we observed them. Just happened to step outside to smoke.;35.2051;-85.913
