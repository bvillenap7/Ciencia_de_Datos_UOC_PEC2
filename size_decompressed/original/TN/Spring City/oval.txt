Very bright blue/white shiny oval object, no sound & stationary, smooth solid with no windows or other features.;2013-06-29 06:07:00;~1 minute;Very bright blue/white shiny oval object, no sound & stationary, smooth solid with no windows or other features. I was heading to work at 6.07 am (East Coast) Saturday June 29th driving west on Rocky Springs road heading toward highway 27, a light patchy mist/fog was covering the surrounding fields & houses the sky was totally clear & the sun was just giving an early dawn light. I had a full view of the sky & a very bright oval object appeared in the sky, it just “blinked” into view , giving off a very bright blue/white light the object was sold & stationary.  It was a clear sky with no clouds & no other objects or aircraft anywhere else in the sky & there was no sound.   I am an experienced skydiver with over 4,000 jumps from various altitudes up to 15,000 feet & using my past experience of jump aircraft types & size I estimated the object was almost due west at between 5,000-7,000 feet with no movement vertically or horizontally.  It appeared as a solid shiny metallic & oval in shape, no windows or other distinguishing features, I stopped my motorcycle & shut off the engine, & noted it made no sound,  I could hear the birds in the fields, confirming the lack of noise from the object.   After approximately one minute, the object just blinked out of sight & the sky was again completely clear.  Based on my skydiving background,  I would estimate the object was between 60-80 feet wide & 35-40 feet in height.;35.695;-84.818
