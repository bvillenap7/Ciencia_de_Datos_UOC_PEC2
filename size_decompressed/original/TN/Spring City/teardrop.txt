It flew horizontally above the ridgeline directly in front of us. It was glowing orange.  I would compare it to the color of molten lava.   There was no smoke, no flames no sound.  It was being followed by a very large helicopter.  This sounds crazy but it disappeared....  There then gone. Coincidentally, it was in the immediate area of the Watts Bar Nuclear Plant.
