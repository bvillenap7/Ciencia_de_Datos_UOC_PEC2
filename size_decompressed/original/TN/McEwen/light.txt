About 20 min. later, the object was then being pursued by plane.  Object changed color from red to blue to green in a short time. The event started approx. at 20:20 in McEwen, TN.  My parents were outside when my mother (legal secretary) looked up and saw something in the sky. She called out my brother and his wife to look at the same thing.  About 20 minutes later they called me (college student) in a town about 2 hrs. away to make sure that they were not looking at a star or a comet.  The first object that they saw changed from a red, to a green, and then to a blue in a short period of time, and had repeated to do so.  At 20:30, my brother noticed an aircraft following along the same tragechtory as the frist craft.  The second craft appeared at about 20:40 and did a color change similar to the other craft.  At 21:00, both craft were to far down on the horizon for anyone to see clearly.  Throughout this entire time, my brother attempted to use a telescope to look more closely at either craft.  He was unable to maintain focus on either of the craft.;36.1192;-87.6441
