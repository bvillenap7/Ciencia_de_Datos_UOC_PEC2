Balls of Bright Lights;2012-08-25 22:50:00;2 minutes;Balls of Bright Lights My husband and I stepped outside to have a cigarette around 10:30 PM, when he noticed a bright, white light in the sky moving in a north to south direction, traveling slow and lower in the sky than a commercial craft would be. He said “That’s a UFO” and pointed upwards. I looked up as it was going across the sky and then it either went straight into outer space or shot across the direction it was going in because the light just disappeared. The same bright white light appeared on 8/28/12 but it was hovering in a south east direction. My husband says it hovered in one place and then it zigzagged as if it was flying down to land. He couldn’t see it once it disappeared past the tree line. For the past week (8/25-8/29/12), we have been seeing bright white with a blue haze, or sometimes they are reddish orange balls of light on my neighbors’ property {which is all wooded} as we are standing outside usually around 10:30 at night. It lasts for few seconds and then disappears. My husband has noticed these balls of light because our dogs start barking during the late hours as if there is a stranger outside. So he gets up to investigate.;36.1192;-87.6441
