Like I said before,at first it just looked like a regular star,me and a friend were watching the skies,hten after a while we noticed that the star was moving around in a circular motion,then it started going up and down then back to were it first started and then doing it all over again.Then finally after about an hour it just shot across the sky really fast and we couldn't see it any more because of the tree's.People tried to tell us it was just a falling star,but i have never seen a star move around like that before it feel. Iwould also like to note that i have information about another sighting that occured 1 and a half to two years ago.It was wittnesed by me and a close friend of mine.I would be happy to share the information about it if you are interested.;36.2063;-88.4239
