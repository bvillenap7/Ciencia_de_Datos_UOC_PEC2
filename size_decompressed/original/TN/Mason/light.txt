It did this for over two hours.  It moved very quickly with pronounced moves when going up and down, and then hovered for a time.  The clouds moved in and I could no longer see it.  This morning around 0500 the sky was clear once again, but no sign of the light although the stars were still out. Anyone else see anything in this area last night?
