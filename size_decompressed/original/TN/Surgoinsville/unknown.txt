Mufon has confirmed sightings here before.;2001-10-29 19:30:00;11:00 pm;Mufon has confirmed sightings here before. It has rotated with the stars for the past 2 nights in the north-eastern sky. It displays yellow,red,blue,and white colors.Blinking brightly. At first I thought it might be a helicopter but as time progressed it seems to move with the stars. I have a Jason Rotary Power 540 telescope and spent at least 30 mins trying to see what the object is but as yet still no clue. Whatever it may be it doesnt look normal. Check it out and see what you can figure out.Its not hard to find. It sticks out like a sore thumb. ((NUFORC Note:  Given that the object of interest was viewed for 3.5 hours, we suspect that it may be a celestial body, either a star or planet.  Only inspection of the object, and its location in the night sky, could resolve whether the object is anything unusual.  PD));36.4729;-82.8323
