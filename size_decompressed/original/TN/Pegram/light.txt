Pulsating or rotating stationary lights high in the night sky;2002-02-02 19:00:00;one hour;Pulsating or rotating stationary lights high in the night sky My wife called me to look at a strange moving light in the night sky. It appeared to be just a star when I first saw it, but then it started darting to the left and right, and up and down. it moved sort of like a hummingbird. The movement was much greater than the shimmering effect on stars caused by atmospheric conditions. as we watched it we could discern colors. We got binoculars and through them we could definitely see rotating or pulsating red and blue lights on the object. After a few mintes the air traffic in our sector became really heavy. A lot of planes. A ground fog moved in and all activity disappeared from our line of sight. It was not a plane, copter, comet, satellite, weather balloon, star, planet or anything logical we could think of.;36.1099;-87.0322
