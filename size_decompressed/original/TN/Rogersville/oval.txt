Strange red lights in strange patterns.;2014-09-04 00:00:00;45 minutes;strange red lights in strange patterns A group of friends and I were standing outside having a conversation, when we saw what appeared to 3 airplanes with red and white lights blinking on bottom.   We observed these air crafts for approximately 30 to 45 minutes, moving from south east to south west and west to east repeatedly and extremtly high rates of speed and made high speed 90 degree turns.  At times the craft appeared to hover in the sky and one seemed drop something in to the ground.  These flying object did not fly in any certain formation but would spread out and cover large areas of the sky and then regroup.   One witness has been in the military for 5 years and said he had never seen any military aircraft that matched the outline or flight pattern of these aircrafts.;36.4162000000001;-83.0108
