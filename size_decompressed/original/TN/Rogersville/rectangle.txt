Rectangle took up position over our horse stable.  ((anonymous report));2018-11-30 10:05:00;10 minutes;Rectangle took up position over our horse stable. Picked up a call from my wife.  She suggested that I take a look at the stable.  Given the fact that we keep several expensive show horses, I wasted no time in getting over there.   Darndest thing, this gold or bronze rectangle remained motionless above the stable.  There it was, perfectly still, stuck up there as it was.  I’d say about twenty, maybe thirty feet above the roof.  More like a monolith, maybe fifteen feet wide, twenty foot in length, and I’d have to say eight to ten feet in height.   Joined up with my wife on the north side, where she said she was going to try and get some pictures.  It didn’t seem to be doing any harm, soundless as it was.  After ten minutes, it wasn’t there.  It’s not like it flew away.  It just wasn’t there. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));36.4162000000001;-83.0108
