Huge star went away.  ((anonymous report)) ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Venus, we wonder??  PD));2017-03-08 20:00:00;30 minutes;Huge star went away. I may be on the wrong site, but I saw a huge star alone in the sky and within 30 minutes, it kept getting smaller and smaller....very fast..  Not a satellite, not an aircraft... Very strange to me.. I know for a fact it wasn't a satellite or aircraft..  I watched it because it was so big at one point..   Does anyone know what I saw? ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Venus, we wonder??
