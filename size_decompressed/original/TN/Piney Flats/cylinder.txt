Rotating cylinder climbing vertically in sky;2012-10-16 10:00:00;1+ hour;Rotating cylinder climbing vertically in sky Observed cylindrical object moving vertically in sky approx.  West NW of my house.  Object appeared to be lighted on each end and rotated as it would flash brightly on one side as it faced the sun. I followed progression thru my astronomy binoculars for at least 30-45 minutes.  Object passed much higher than jets in flight.  I did not hear any reports on local news.  I have observed Space Station and other satellites in sky but have never seen anything like this.;36.45;-82.3354
