Viewed three silver colored spherical objects above high voltage TVA power lines.;2011-09-30 17:40:00;30 seconds;Viewed three silver colored spherical objects above high voltage TVA power lines. While walking from my mailbox to the back door of my home I noticed three silver colored spherical objects below the horizion but just above a nearby treeline west of my position.  The three objects were about the same elevation and in close proximity to one another.  The distance between the objects was about one and one half times their diameter.   At first I thought these objects were part of some new construction I had not noticed before.  They looked somewhat like the distant view of the top of high mast stadium lighting.  Wanting to get a better look I placed my mail on the ground to mark the position where I was standing and noted the direction I was looking relative to the roof of a nearby house before going into a nearby storage building to get a pair of binoculars.   When I returned less thn two minutes later the objects were gone.  Looking at the area where the objects had been I could see the tops of two metal towers supporting TVA high voltage transmissi! on lines.  No part of these towers has any circular shape and the cloudy skies rule out any reflections off the towers.   I am quite certain of what I saw but I have no idea what these objects were.  I am filing this report in hopes someone else saw these objects and files a supporting report.;36.45;-82.3354
