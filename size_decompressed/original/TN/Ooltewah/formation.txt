Bright orange/red lights in Big Dipper formation, stationary over Ooltewah, TN;2013-06-20 22:00:00;>2 minutes;Bright orange/red lights in Big Dipper formation, stationary over Ooltewah, TN Approx. 10 pm I was traveling south on I-75 through Ooltewah, TN.  I saw many orange/red star shaped lights plainly in the sky, seemed to be at a low elevation.  There were at least 15 lights in a formation closely resembling the big dipper.  It was so vivid and apparent, I automatically assumed it was some kind of man-made event.   I was alone in my car, but there were lots of vehicles traveling, all those folks had to see them also.  I thought it was a carnival, perhaps lights on a Ferris wheel.  The closer I got, it became painfully evident these were not Ferris wheel lights, cell tower lights, aircraft or even the Big Dipper itself.   I noticed the bottom two lights would turn off and on, they also switched positions.  The rest of the lights were totally stationary.  They did sort of resemble flare lights, but couldn't have been because of the formation, stationary position and those bottom two lights moving left to right.   This was an astounding site, I was literal! ly in shock as I drove by them.  I didn't stop, I was on an expressway, but I did wonder why people weren't stopping to take photo's and video's.  Perhaps someone did, I certainly hope so. I have traveled this road many times, and have never seen anything even close to looking like this.  That's why I thought a carnival with rides was recently set up.   I hope others will report this and if there's a legitimate reason for the lights, I would love to know the source.;35.0788;-85.0630000000001
