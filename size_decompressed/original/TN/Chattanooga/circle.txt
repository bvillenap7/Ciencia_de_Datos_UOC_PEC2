Blue Circles & 1 Red Circle float in formation (Alt. 20K to 50K feet);1972-12-01 17:00:00;hour, roughly;Blue Circles & 1 Red Circle float in formation (Alt. 20K to 50K feet) I was 11 and staying with my sister's family. Her husband was taking me and several others on a church cookout (at a park?). We were riding in a regular school bus. As dusk approached, we noticed a bright blue circle high in the sky - maybe 20,000 to 50,000 feet. It seemed to float there. It was soon joined by another blue one and later a red one. They all seemed to float in some kind of formation. As we rode further still, we noticed that people were pulling over and getting out to look up at the same thing. This lasted until almost dark (about an hour) and then they split up and flew off in different directions. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));35.0451159685863;-85.2526698952882
a or multiple flashing lights perfictally syncronized;2006-11-11 06:00:00;1 minute;a or multiple flashing lights perfictally syncronized I was in the car going home and looked out the window twords the moon.  in a couple of seconds I saw 5 sequenced strobe lights flash as if an object with one light on it was moving fast starting from a stand still.  The object was moving at such a speed that it almost looked like a blur but still distenct, like it was rapidly stopping and then moving again.it made a low pitched sound that made only my ears ring. Than after a minute it was GONE.;35.0451159685863;-85.2526698952882
