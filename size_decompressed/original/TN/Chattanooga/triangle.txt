I am a high school English teacher and maintain a part-time job at the local mall.  On Saturday, October 16, 1999, I was scheduled to work late, and I did not get home until around 9:30-9:40 p.m.  As I got out of my car, I looked in the sky over my house (to the north west).  I saw something (I guess I thought it was a plane at first)that looked a little odd.  I walked out the my back yard to get a better view.  I saw 3 craft.  They  were triangular in shape and were traveling fairly close together.  They had very little lighting, but the shapes were quite clear.  They seemed to be flying fairly low, but I couldn't begin to estimate their distance.  I watched for 2-3 minutes in awe.  They seemed to have some movement, but they didn't seem to really travel across the sky.  After a couple of minutes, I ran inside to get my husband so he could see, but when I finally got him out there, the crafts were gone.  I happened to mention this to my parents on the following day, even though I knew they would think I was probably crazy.  Instead, they told me that their best friend (now deceased) had witnessed the exact same thing two months prior to my sighting.  He lives about 70 miles north of me, so it not quite in the same vicinity.  Both sightings included the three craft that were dull, black with white lights on each corner of the triangle.  This is fairly vague information, but until I listened to Art Bell tonight, I hadn't really considered reporting what I had seen.  I have forgotten most of the specifics, but I did want this to be on some type of record.  I had never really doubted the idea of UFOs, but I never thought I would actually see something which couldn't easlily be explained.;35.0451159685863;-85.2526698952882
Triangular UFO witnessed at Army Ammunition Plant;2009-02-19 01:00:00;2 Minutes;Triangular UFO witnessed at Army Ammunition Plant I was driving through the access road that cuts across the old abandoned army ammunition plant.  I witnessed a triangular craft hovering just above the treeline ahead of me.   I slowed down and was only able to see the underside of the craft.  It had a light in each corner.  I drove past in awe and turned around to get a second look but it was gone.   I don't know if this has any relation but I have also seen people in radioactive suits in the area.  I have read that there is some correlation with nuclear areas and UFO activity. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness describes self as a university student, studying in a professional field.

8-10 moving lighted objects traveling slowly without sound, northeast orangish in color,4-5 minutes then disappearing.;2013-04-28 21:00:00;4 minutes;8-10 moving lighted objects traveling slowly without sound, northeast orangish in color,4-5 minutes then disappearing. The objects were triangular in shape which appeared to have 3 lights, white to orangish in color, traveling slowly, snychronized, going north east over Chattanooga, in a zig,zag formation like 2 lines staying equal distant apart, no noise (I thought maybe helicopters at first but there was no sound).  They were below the clouds, maybe 3-4000 feet above us. The sky was clearing from rain/clouds we had all day. No wind. First time I have witnessed lighted objects moving in the sky without sound.;35.0451159685863;-85.2526698952882
Triangle shaped object pure white in color;2013-06-29 18:50:00;30 seconds;triangle shaped object , pure white in color I was in my office closing out the end of the months books, and my boss was outside smoking a cigarette he came running inside and said come here quickly you got to see this.  I jumped up from my chair and followed him outside.  I looked into the sky and witnessed an odd object hovering in the sky we both stared at it and it rotated clockwise almost 360 degrees it was triangular in shape the pointy end was facing up and the flatter end facing the ground it was pure white in color and made no sound the sun was behind us and I could see lines on it but difficult also to make out.   We watched it for a little while and we both looked at each other and looked back up and it was gone this all happened at 6:50pm on 06/29/13 west of Hwy 153 near Shallowford Rd.

Black triangle traveling at low altitude and hovering.;2014-10-10 20:17:00;3 minutes;Black triangle traveling at low altitude and hovering. My wife and I were traveling down highway 58 after dinner.  All of a sudden, a craft appeared in sight from the right side of the road.  It was in slow descent.  It did not appear to be a conventional aircraft in terms of it flight characteristics.   As we approached closer it wad noted to triangular in shape.  There were three lights on each point of the triangle that were white in color.  The center of the craft had a red light that flashed occasionally but without purpose.  I could see the surface of the craft as well and it appeared dark and possibly reflective.  The craft as it descended crossed the road and I made a uturn in my car to try to get a picture.  It was then noted to be hovering at treetop level (for about 10 seconds ) and was silent.  I estimate the craft to be around the size of 3 sedan sized cars.   After I had made my uturn and parked, the craft then started moving again and crossed the highway once more and all of a sudden disappeared.  It did not descend or ascend, it just went out of sight completely.   When I first saw the craft I thought it was plane due to a blinking light in the center, then noted it could be a helicopter as the light pattern didn't look typical.  Then noted it couldn't be a helicopter due to the fact it was traveling so smoothly.;35.0451159685863;-85.2526698952882
Unusual bright flying object.;2014-11-17 18:10:00;15-20 seconds;Unusual bright flying object. On 11/17/14, around 6:10 ((p.m.)), an usual bright flying object in the sky grabbed my attention while I was driving.  Can't tell the exact shape of the object, since it was extremely dark, but the arrangements of the lights seemed that it was triangle.  Few bright lights on top and as it got wider at the bottom there were several lights.  It can be described as a short and wide cone shape.   It looked like it was flying below the clouds, moving very slow and there wasn't any sound.  The visibility was for only 15-20 sec and than disappeared in a blink of an eye.   I thereafter, searched for all the possible planes, jets, helicopters and drones but nothing matched with description of what I saw.;35.0451159685863;-85.2526698952882
Triangular white/clear light grouping;2015-03-16 22:50:00;5 minutes;triangular white/clear light grouping On this evening my wife, son, and I were traveling SW on Mnt. Creek Rd., just past the BP and Four Squares, when I noticed on my left a few ridges over towards the river and Amnicola Hgwy a triangular configuration of lights low over the ridges.  Not sure of the crafts distance due to light pollution along my route.  After losing sight of the lights below the closest of the ridges, we were able to pull over in a church parking lot and catch a glimpse of what we believed was the same object just in a much dimmer capacity.  Never able to properly identify this object or objects.  Other than appearing dimmer the object never seemed to move.  The lights appeared white or clear.;35.0451159685863;-85.2526698952882
Two triangle objects, one hovering for long period with second coming back in and out, then traveling out together.;2017-10-17 20:30:00;15 minutes;Two triangle objects, one hovering for long period with second coming back in and out, then traveling out together. My home is on a ridge overlooking the river and entire city of Chattanooga.  From the second story, my children and I look at the city lights out the window as they are put to bed.   Today I saw a light I have never noticed before and it did not seem to move.  I watched from one room and never saw the object move.  I thought I was losing it, so I went to the opposite side of the house and looked and it was still there.  At this time I noticed a secondary object appear.  They were both white at that time.   I looked for my husband, couldn't find him, went downstairs and out the front door.  The two objects were still there, only this time moving slowly toward my house and higher as they went.  They moved in unison and the color started changing from one to many colors-- the entire outer rim of the objects were changing colors.  I kept rubbing my eyes thinking my contacts were drying out, but the lights were glowing and changing, and at this point I could see the lights were in triangle shapes around the object.  I couldn't make out the edges of the objects, only the lights.   Then, after they passed my house I lost sight of them because my house blocked my direct line of sight.  When I rediscovered them after running around the house they were much further to the left and had made a major change of direction.  Then there was only one the second disappeared.   About 15 years ago, I saw a red orb in the middle of the day hovering in Athens, TN, over the interstate.;35.0451159685863;-85.2526698952882

I sat down, after dancing for a while, and was looking up enjoying the sky.  I noticed some blinking red and green lights on a black triangular shape moving slowly from east to west.  There was a big crowd and I looked around to see if anyone else was seeing this but couldn't tell, as most folks were watching the show and such.  It flew in a straight line, and I watched it until it was out of sight.;35.0451159685863;-85.2526698952882
