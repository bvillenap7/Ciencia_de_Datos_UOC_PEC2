A real bright flash of light.;2008-06-22 10:30:00;second or two;A real bright flash of light. On July 22 or 23, 2008 somewhere between 10 and 11:30 AM.  My mother and I were in my living room I was on my computer and she was watching TV. We live very close to Chickamauga Dam.  Had the window open it was a nice day… sunny partly cloudy very hot…. when a flash of some sort filled the room.  It was like someone was outside taking a picture with a flash… except brighter and lasting only a second or two.  At first I thought there was something wrong with my eyes. There was no sound. When I realized it was not my eyes.  I asked my mother…what was that?   She said “I don’t know something just flashed”.   My electricity did not flicker or anything.  This only happened the one time.  I have not heard if anyone else saw it or not.  We were just curious if any one else saw it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

He just had sited a big Ship recently that was transparent  hovering over LA.  He later sent me a photo of it ...  Clearly a round disc shaped ship with a bean coming down.   As soon as he walked away from the car and I pulled out of the parking lot, a low flying blue flash streaked  across the back of the building and came out the other side so fast it was gone in seconds.  Very bright blue and white… ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));35.0451159685863;-85.2526698952882
