Then dispersed in different directions in less than 1 sec. 3 very bright oval objects, elevation not known due to the time of day, appeared to be hoovering stationary at 20-30,000 ft. they dissapeared in less than a sec. I arrived home about 20 minutes later, and woke my parents and told them what I had seen. If my memory serves me, the sighting was reported by others and on the local news the next day. I did not report the sighting at the time.;35.0451159685863;-85.2526698952882
Oval-shaped, lighted craft seen in southern Tennessee;2006-09-15 00:23:00;15-20 minutes;Oval-shaped, lighted craft seen in southern Tennessee A friend and I had gone out to dinner in Chattanooga with her parents. Her older brother was to be meeting us at Outback with his girlfriend to celebrate my friend having been released for one of what we though to be her final two week breaks before she was to be cleared for being in remission for the cancer she had been suffering with for the last year. We all gathered and had a wonderful time at dinner, and when we decided to leave we had to sit much longer than expected because the battery in my friends parents’ van had died. Her brother helped jump start the battery and her dad was to take the brother and his girlfriend home for some reason I can’t remember. Well, this left myself, my friend, and her deaf mother to go together back to our home in a different city (about thirty minutes away), since my friend was to be spending the night with me that night. Finally we got on the road and about ten to twelve minutes after we got on the freeway Amy and I saw an odd light out of the corner of our eyes and both looked up to see what it was. We both saw what looked to be an oval-shaped ring of various colors (pink, green, blue, orange, yellow, purple, and white) that was titled at an angle and seemed to be spinning counter-clockwise. It was dormant in the sky, staying in one place and not moving. Suddenly it began, very slowly, to move in a ‘cross’ pattern (up, down, up, left, right, down). We weren’t the only one who noticed because we saw people sticking pointed fingers from their cars and honking their horns. Finally, it seemed to just lower behind the mountains we were headed towards and disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  We have assigned an arbitrary date above, to reflect a date in Fall 2006.

Bright orange light moving slowly across the sky.;2014-02-02 00:00:00;3 minutes;Bright orange light moving slowly across the sky. We seen an orange light moving slow across the sky from left to right.  At first I thought it was still and was on top of a tower.  We were driving on Highway 153 and pulled off on the Amnicola Hwy exit.  We got out of the car and watched it move across the highway.  It started coming down slowly like a balloon that had old helium in it.  The object while moving across the sky looked bigger than a star.   When it started coming down the light went out came back on and went right out again.  It was night so at best it looked dark grayish and like a 50 gallon yard clipping bag, but only bigger than that.   It appeared to be making its way back toward us while coming down.  Then It disappeared behind tall trees.   We got back in the car and drove into the neighborhood where the trees were. Unfortunately we couldn't find it.;35.0451159685863;-85.2526698952882
White/blue sphere with an orange glow and a jet steam of smoke and blue flame.;2014-08-24 00:30:00;5 seconds;White/blue sphere with an orange glow and a jet steam of smoke and blue flame I saw a low flying oval shape with a strong tail containing smoke and a light blue fire with an orange hue around it.   It appeared to slow down over the downtown buildings and then completely disappeared.   I was at an outside restaurant and several witnesses can attest.;35.0451159685863;-85.2526698952882

My sister decided to come to my bed to sleep that night, and she kept staring out of the window, because her bed isn’t by the window. “;2020-03-27 23:30:00;1-2 minutes;My sister decided to come to my bed to sleep that night, and she kept staring out of the window, because her bed isn’t by the window. “There are a lot of stars out tonight,” my sister examined incorrectly. I looked around, but there was only one star. “What do you mean?” I asked confused, “There’s only one star where we can see.” Then, she pointed behind the trees at a bright light. It clearly wasn’t a star, but it was too high (I compared it with a house) to be a lamppost, or anything else producing light that was attached to the ground. I layed back down, thinking that it was just some other form of light that is commonly seen, or even an extremely bright star. Anything other than what I saw next after I looked up again. Out of nowhere, an oval shaped, flat, small-car-sized floating craft lifted up from behind the trees, turning out to be the “star”, and moved slowly to the left of my house. It was hard to see in the dark, but I made out a few features: It was flat, too flat to be an airplane or helicopter (and too quiet), and it had 3 lights in the front, the middle one aiming forwards and slightly up, and one on each side of the front aiming straight out. It was the same thing in the back, but facing the opposite direction, and more dim, probably showing which way they were facing. The lights were just a bright, blank, white, unlike an airplane, with multiple different colors of light. It made a light sound, similar to an airplane's, but only about half of the volume. It was very recently that this happened, so I haven’t seen it again. If I do, I’ll make another report.;35.0451159685863;-85.2526698952882
