Saucer went overhead at 150 feet high. No lights, no sound. Diameter 150-200 feet. Black in color. Saw rivets where different sheets of metal put together much like on a jets wings. I was on the back deck of my apartment looking for UFO's as there had been a rash of sightings in Chattanooga sometime in the late 70's. Not sure of date. Try and check there newspaper records from 75-79 and I think you will find it very interesting. Many newspaper reports with the mayor and chief of police chasing them in their cars one night and having a saucer land on a school playground and takeoff when they approached. Anyway, that's why I was on my deck. It was a bright clear moonlit night. I had been there maybe 15 minutes when a large black, saucer shaped object was coming directly at my face, 150 feet high. Was 150-200 feet in diameter. I yelled at my brother and girlfriend to come look. They laughed, didn't take me seriously so I was the only witness. I saw the bottom of the ship only but saw several pieces of metal with what looked like rivets, like on an airplanes wing, holding the pieces of metal together. It was slow moving. My guess 15 to 20 mph. No lights, no sound. Went over my head and over apartment. Ran to front door and watched it disappear over other apartments and trees. Always screaming for brother and his girlfriend to come look. Never did. I've told my other brother this story and my wife and children. My brother that was at the event I never told because he would still think I was nuts. These are the only people I've ever told until this letter to you.;35.0451159685863;-85.2526698952882

As I leaned against a pole, i looked into the sky and saw a really bright light. I thought how amazing it was that I was staring at the sun for about a minute and not have to look away. I said to myself, How am i staring at the sun this long and my eyes are not hurting?   I told my brother to look into the sky and then we both saw that bright light turn off.  The object appeared.  It was at first a silver saucer shaped object.  Then all of a sudden its wings shot out on two sides of the object, and started to twirl around at an extremely fast pace.  We were expecting the object to fly either east or west.  Instead the object flew out, as in out of our vision and into another part of the galaxy.  It was something that we will never forget.;35.0451159685863;-85.2526698952882
