I myself did not see it, but it was observed by an astronomy class and a U. of Tenn at Chattanooga professor..Also some calls from Dunlap TN. It was a a curtain of faint red along the ecliptic from West to east and changed in width.  It did not cover the entire sky, may be 1/5 of the sky..I know this is not a UFO but it was rare for this part of the world..I heard earlier there was a powerful solar flare earlier on Thursday.. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the report describes a display of the aurora borealis, which is very rare at the latitude indicated.  The same phenomenon was reported on the same evening from southern New Jersey.  The writer is correct with regard to a major coronal mass ejection from the Sun earlier on the same day.));35.0451159685863;-85.2526698952882
canard wing craft;2002-11-11 15:30:00;30 sec;canard wing craft I saw the largest canard wing craft I have ever seen traveleing ESE. in East Ridge Tn. The canard appeared to be at least 60ft in span, traveling quietly. Several other cars stopped to see it go over as I did. It wasn't alien but I believe it may be secret. After spending 2 hours searching the net for a similar craft I can't find one. It was white and may have had wing tips on the main wings. Biggest Canard I have ever seen. Chattanooga Airport said they didn't know what it was. ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know if the sighting occurred at 3:30 a.m., or p.m..  We assume it was an afternoon sighting, and we have amended the indicated time accordingly.  The shape of the object reported brings to mind the LearStar aircraft, which has a canard wing.  However, it is a turboprop driven aircraft, which therefore should have been audible.  PD));35.0451159685863;-85.2526698952882
U.F.O.s over Tennessee;2008-04-18 00:10:00;20 mins;U.F.O.s over Tennessee On Fri. the 18th at Midnight 6 witnesses and I witnessed a U.F.O. over Tennessee. My mother (who does not believe in U.F.O.s) said she saw a light in the sky. I went out to investigate and up in the sky was a light, which at first I dismissed as a star. I was about to walk back inside when I saw this craft move at incredible speed closer to us. It was then that I noticed that what I was looking at was NO STAR! It was cigar shaped with a long triangular strut coming off the top and two smaller ones coming out the bottom, kind of like landing gear. I noticed yellow and green lights rotating around the craft with a large yellow light on top of the large triangular strut. It hovered COMPLETELY noiseless for about 10 minutes, then me and my family witnessed 3 or 4 smaller crafts come out of the bottom and fly away. The speeds of these crafts were humanly impossible! The smaller crafts were pulsating green lights. After about another 8 minutes we all witnessed the smaller crafts re-enter the large one. It continued to hover for a couple of minutes then it just disappeared right before our eyes! I just want to let everyone know that this is NO HOAX! I am very good at debunking things but I can never debunk what my family and I saw that night. I have also heard numerous reports on the internet about a lot of other people seeing these objects not only in Tennessee but in other states as well. I hope more people come forward about these sightings.;35.0451159685863;-85.2526698952882

I could see through it but the veiny blue lights I could see but faint and as I watched the object pick up speed and at that height it wasn’t a jet going that fast so unless it was the government in one of theirs it went Northeast from these coordinates. 35.0179, -85.1666 Around 10:30-10:45.;35.0451159685863;-85.2526698952882
Brilliant Illumination fixed spot in sky, did not move, then dissipated;2021-08-28 20:30:00;9 minutes;Brilliant Illumination fixed spot in sky, did not move, then dissipated Chattanooga Tennessee August 28, 2021, between sunset and twilight 8:30pm and 8:39pm . A fellow musician was invited to play music at a private party on the rooftop of a home and  I played percussion that night. During the time I was not playing I struck up a conversation with a beautiful long white haired woman in a white dress visiting from CA. It was still fairly light outside when all the sudden I noticed a really bright planet and pointed it out. We both sat marveling at its beauty. As I scanned the sky as I often do at dusk to my left between Lookout mountain and Elder mountain I could see the aquarium and Olgiati bridge. Then I noticed an even brighter light but it wasn’t yellowish In color like the previous planet/star I had been eyeing. Nope this was different. This array of light was right between Lookout and Elder,that’s how low to the ground it was. This clear silver white,bright light was neither a star nor a planet. Almost like a spotlight on steroids. ‘do you see what I’m seeing,or is it just me?’ She replied ‘oh no,it’s not just you I see it too.’ I was like,’have you ever seen anything that bright before?’ She said, ‘I can’t recall ever,maybe it’s a satellite.’ ‘No, satellites are way way way higher up in the atmosphere. I have seen satelites before this thing feels like it’s right in our face!’ ‘Maybe it’s the North Star?’ It was located South West and within the earths troposhphere so it couldn’t have been a star. I just kept carrying on how unbelievably bright and BIG it was. The shape looked like a mix of great heptagram,irregular polygon and heptagram. It never moved from that one spot. It was a single object for sure. It did not sway side to side nor move from the spot we first began seeing it at.  It was literally like a hole was ripped into the atmosphere. It didn’t move. Didn’t budge. I ran to get my cell phone to film this and by the time I pulled up my camera I watched it start to fade.  Then flicker almost as if someone was blowing out an electronic candle. Slowly this light was disapating until the shine was completely out. It’s like it just withdrew itself from the universe. Almost like it was never there to begin with. Another way to describe the shape and color  was like the sparkle on a diamond ring. No it wasn’t cloud cover that made it fade away. This brightness was not a plane nor a helicopter. It appeared in one spot and disappeared in the same spot.;35.0451159685863;-85.2526698952882
