Several flashes of light from a stationary point very high in the night sky, followed by a moving fuzzy red light;2006-10-24 20:50:00;2 events, 90 seconds tota;Several flashes of light from a stationary point very high in the night sky, followed by a moving fuzzy red light 10/24/06, 20:50 Sky conditions clear, Milky Way plainly visible.  Approximately 8:50 pm as I stepped out onto our second floor deck a bright white star like flash of light high in the night sky caught my eye, it originated from a point about 80 degrees up and directly in the SSW.  I continued to watch the area thinking it was just a plane or possibly the final glint from an Iridium flare, after four or five seconds another flash occurred in exactly the same spot. No other lights were visible near that point of light. After another four to five seconds another flash appeared in exactly the same place, it was clear now that this was coming from a stationary source. I observed three more flashes approximately the same time apart as the previous ones the last two however were about half the intensity as the first four. After several minutes and no activity I decided that it was over and I went inside to get the phone. I went back out with the phone and called my father to tell him about what I had just seen all the while keeping my eye on that area of the sky. Five minutes into the conversation I observed a commercial jet heading from South to North, nothing unusual. At about the same time as I noticed the jet coming from the South a fuzzy, red pulsating light appeared in the SSW slightly lower in the sky than the first event I described above. After a few seconds it was apparent that this red light was moving in my general direction and that it would pass directly overhead and that it would also intersect the path of the northbound jet, although at a much higher altitude. Careful scrutiny of the silent, rapidly approaching red light revealed absolutely no other lights on this craft. The light itself appeared somewhat fuzzy, with the apparent size of a pea held at arms length, it had a central hotspot that seemed very slightly less red than the overall area of red light. It appeared to pulsate between bright and dim about once a second, never actually going black between pulses. The night was practically silent, no traffic no, ambient noise. The only sounds were the barely discernable engine noise from the faraway jet and the occasional rustling of leaves. As I said the red light was headed in my general direction, moving from the SSW to the NNE and from my perspective it appeared that it was going to pass through the very same spot in the sky as the light flashes noted above. At the point when it did reach that spot, and coincidently high above the northbound jet this red light suddenly changed direction. It’s hard to describe, but essentially, one second it’s on a path that will bring it directly overhead and the next it’s moving parallel to the northbound jet, although higher and to the right of the plane. I was able to observe the jet and this object for the next 10 or 15 seconds as they headed North and eventually out of my view.;35.0451159685863;-85.2526698952882
Close bright light travelled across a south to north-northeast flight path;2008-07-19 22:15:00;~ 1 min;Close bright light travelled across a south to north-northeast flight path On my back porch on a humid night. Notice a bright light moving too fast for civilian aircraft, and much too close and bright on the horizon to be a satellite. Object was traveled almost SW-N - NE  in a straight path. No sound or typical blinking lights associated with aircraft were observed. This was a very hazy night out. Could hardly see constellations other than ursa major. This light looked much too close to be a satellite.;35.0451159685863;-85.2526698952882
Directly overhead we saw 4 different objects appearing to be faint stars moving in different directions. ?UFOS?;2008-11-01 22:00:00;1 min;Directly overhead we saw 4 different objects appearing to be faint stars moving in different directions. ?UFOS? We were camping, looking at the stars and noticed what appeared to be faint stars (bluish white) moving in different directions.  As soon as we saw one, we noticed other moving lights.  The lights did not blink and I kept my eye on one until it vanished as if it got to far out of site and i am talking directly over head!   It was a clear night, not a cloud in site.  The distance to these objects is unknown but there is no way a normal jetliner could fly so high as to appear to be a faint star. the speed of the objects appeared to move at the rate of speed as a jet, but the distance to it was twice as far if not outside our atmosphere. I dont know what they were but i know what they were not.;35.0451159685863;-85.2526698952882

Silent blue light and motionless white light seen in sky over Chattanooga;2009-06-04 22:30:00;10 minutes;Silent blue light and motionless white light seen in sky over Chattanooga Two neighbors and I were sitting on the porch enjoying the cool night breeze. We were all talking when I noticed a bright white light in the sky straight ahead of my line of sight (in the direction of the Tennessee River). At first I dismissed it as a helicopter. In that general direction is Erlanger Medical and the Life Force helicopter is not an unusual occurrence. I watched this for a few minutes without comment. Then a second, much brighter round blue light approached slowly from further away to come close to the stationary white light. I said “what is that?” My neighbors stopped talking and turned around to look up at the two lights. We were all on our feet at this point, talking about how strange the blue light was. It moved like a slow helicopter with an atypical light, yet it was totally silent. The helicopters that fly around this area are never silent. Also, there wasn’t any traffic that night. It was quiet out and we couldn’t hear engine sounds. The white light winked out after six or seven minutes and the blue light flew away in the direction of North Chattanooga until it was gone. Roughly a minute later it flew back in our direction, performing a few maneuvers. I made an offhand comment that if anything ‘came out’ of the light we should all hightail it indoors and lay low. The blue light headed off again across the river until it was out of sight. I’m not sure what to make of this sighting. We have helicopters, a major airport in Brainerd, and the Riverbend Festival was still going on at Ross’s Landing. Nothing matches what we saw. The light was too back and forth to be a plane and too quiet to be a helicopter. And nothing at Riverbend is an airborne attraction. What is most profound to me, and my neighbors as well, was the eerie quality of that blue light. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Four family members witnessed some 14-18 bright yellow/orange lights move slowly over city;2011-12-28 17:50:00;30 minutes;Four family members witnessed some 14-18 bright yellow/orange lights move slowly over city We live on the brow of a mountain that looks out over the city of Chattanooga, TN.  At about 9:30 pm my daughter, who is only 8 yrs old, was looking out our bay window and asked me to come look at this yellow/orange light in the sky.  I said, oh it's probably just a helicopter but as I pulled back the drapes to reveal the enitre line of sight from the window, I was astonished to see that the sky was full of them. The lights were clearly moving and all of them seemed to be moving in the same direction, across the mountain from the SouthWest heading NorthEast.  The mountain we live on is some 2300 in elevation and the lights were not too far higher than that, but clearly above the mountain, as they passed over the mountain. My father and his wife live next door and we called them to come out on the porch and look. They both witnessed the event as well.  My father (68) and myself (40) have lived on the mountain for most of our entire lives, on the brow of the mountain since 1980 and neither of us have ever experienced anything like what we saw. I have looked every night since and have not seen anything at all in the night skies other than distant planes and helicopters that rarely, if ever, come across the mountain.  Most all commercial flights into the city approach from the South (atlanta) and are visible way off on the horizon flying direclty north into the airport. I would be very interested in recieveing some feedback about what we experienced.  I will go on and say that since this night, we have been watching a lot of internet and TV shows about UFO sightings and we found out experience very similar to the Lights Over Phoenix experience. Thanks.;35.0451159685863;-85.2526698952882
Bright light in my window.;2014-03-31 03:00:00;15 minutes;Bright light in my window. I was laying in bed when I saw a light being shined in my window lighting the opposite walls of my room.  I look out my window to see a bright light in the sky, probably a few hundred feet in the air, flying over my house.  It was completely silent and sort of indescribable.  It flew directly over my house.   I ran to the front of the house to continue watching it.  I watched it for about 15 minutes or so float to the SE.   Now I do live by an airport and I see airplanes all the time at night.  This was coming from a direction that I don't see planes coming from, it was completely silent, and I could see it much longer in the air than I normally see a plane.   I plane flying in that direction would have been out of sight within minutes.   This was still visible for at least 15 minutes.;35.0451159685863;-85.2526698952882
