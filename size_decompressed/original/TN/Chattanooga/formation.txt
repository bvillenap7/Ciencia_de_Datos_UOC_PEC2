Three bright stationary lights above Chattanooga, TN.;2015-07-27 21:25:00;8 minutes;Three bright stationary lights above Chattanooga, TN I got out of the car with my 17 year old son.  We both saw what we thought was aircraft at first over the ridge near our house.  They were bright as street lights, three lights in a triangular form.   They were stationary until the bottom corner just vanished, I thought maybe it was moving behind the clouds that were thin and sparse.  Then the next lights just poof!  It was gone, then the third.  We watched these lights for 5-8 minutes.   The sky behind was clear, the only clouds were way in front and extremely thin.  The moon is bright and these lights were vivid.   I stayed out until I was sure they were gone, I didn't want to miss anything.   I tried to video what we were seeing, but for some reason the camera didn't pick up the lights.;35.0451159685863;-85.2526698952882
