Driving S on Browns Ferry Rd., before Browns Ferry Landing, I noticed to my right a plane flying about 2000ft over Raccon Mountain.;2014-11-01 06:30:00;3;Driving south on Browns Ferry Rd before Brownsferry Landing, I noticed to my right a plane flying about 2000ft over Raccoon Mountian heading northeast towards Chattanooga.  The plane had a blue light at the end of one wing and red light at the end of the other wing.  In the middle were two large white lights.   The plane flew directly over my car as I stopped on Browns Ferry RD.  As it flew past my position, I rolled down the window to hear it.  No sound.   It banked slightly right, then back left and continued over Tennessee River north side of Treatment Plant, then out of sight.  I have never seen a plane like that and thought it may have been a drone or something unusual.   Look like large car lights on the front of the plane or object.

Afternoon sighting.;2017-11-27 15:45:00;3 minutes;Afternoon sighting. While doing errands on a sunny afternoon, I took note of the faintly lit moon in the sky at 3:45 p.m..   I then noticed a metallic cigar or rectangular shaped object to the west of the moon, traveling northwest at a slow speed, and low enough to see it was not an airplane.  It was hard to distinguish its shape.   I pulled the car over for a focused view, but still could not determine its exact shape.   Then I saw a second object traveling close to it, in the same direction.  The objects moved closer together and seemed to merge.   I turned my car around to follow them and by the time I got turned they were gone. My family is generational Air Force.  I am a former flight attendant, and I have been an observant sky watcher for many years.   This is my second daytime sighting the other was in central California.  I have also observed 2 orange-colored orbs moving southwest from my area of the cityâ€™s ridge.;35.0451159685863;-85.2526698952882
