6 Diamond shaped objects over Chattanooga, TN;2007-12-13 19:30:00;10 minutes;6 Diamond shaped objects over Chattanooga, TN There were 6 objects in a pattern hovering in the air. They were each diamond shaped with lights on them. They would be in the air and then I could see them come down one by one and as they came down, the light would go off then come back on. There was a helicopter circling the object but it would not get very close. I stood and observed them for what felt like 10 minutes.;35.0451159685863;-85.2526698952882
