Floating object with red,yellow,green lights.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Capella??  PD));2012-10-23 21:00:00;3 hours;Floating object with red,yellow,green lights My daughters and I were getting out of the car when we saw what we thought was a bright star.  As we stared at it it started to float up and then floated right over us.  It had one bright white light and green,yellow,red lights on the bottom that swirled in a circle motion.  It didnt not make any noise at all.It was very hard to see or make out the shape but looked like a circle? If the lights had not been  on we would have never seen it.  There were two of them on the 23rd, but they were out again on the 24th and there was 4-5. Then on the 25th there was about 2 but they were too high up to see. I tried to video them the first night,but when we looked at the video you couldnt see anything..they didnt show up?;35.5133;-86.3305
Large round object larger three times larger than the sun in presentation;2014-06-12 04:45:00;10 minutes;large round object larger three times larger than the sun in presentation As I headed out of my driveway and down my road, I saw a massive round reddish/orange  circle over my left shoulder, initially I thought it was the sun.   The circular object remained visible as I exited my neighborhood.  I then realized I was seeing this object in the Western sky.   This is the 2nd or 3rd time I have seen this object in that general area, I will now carry my camera with me in hopes of capturing video footage.;35.5133;-86.3305

After about an hour of watching this plane circle, it flew off heading North.    Approximately five minutes after it exited the area, this large,circular object reddish/orange in color, appeared in the Western sky and headed SE and then stopped.   I then witnessed what appeared to be red colored lightning and then smoke or a cloud began forming around it,  I ran inside grabbed my phone and climbed onto my roof to record the event.
