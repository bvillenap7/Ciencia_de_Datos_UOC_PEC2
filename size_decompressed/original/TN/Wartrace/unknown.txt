Next afternoon was questioned by parent about bright lights. When I was 17 years old, I awoke in my underwear running from a bright light in my backyard. I was terrified. Next I awoke in my bed and vividly remembered running from the light.  I thought it was just a nightmare and went back to sleep.  The next day I woke up and looked at my watch that I had on been wearing overnight and realized that I was late for school.  I hurried and got dressed and rushed to school only to find that I was ~45 minutes early.  I thought nothing of it.  During my first period class, the girl that sat in the desk behind me asked me what day it was.  I told her the date and someone beside me said I was wrong. My watch was a day ahead.  This would not be strange except that I clearly remembered her asking me what day it was the day before the event and the date on my watch was correct.  Still I did not think about my nightmare, nor did I suspect anything more than a malfunctioning watch.  After school I returned to my home.  When I walked in my mom was in the kitchen.  I talked to her for a few minutes and told her about my day. Then she said something that chills me to the bone to this day.  She asked me if I saw a bright light out my window last night. She said the light woke her up and she wasn't real sure what it was and then it went away.  The window to her bedroom was on the same side of the house that I was on while running from the bright light. Our house is 100 yards from the road and our driveway is on the opposite side of the house.  I am not sure what happened to me, but I have a feeling that I may have been abducted.
