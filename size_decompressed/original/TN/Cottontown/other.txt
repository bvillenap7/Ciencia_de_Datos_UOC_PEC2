Many shooting stars spotted;1998-12-13 23:25:00;30 min;Many shooting stars spotted I was out walking my dog.It was cold and clear and the stars were shining brightly. I looked up as I usually do to observe the stars and a green shooting star appeared right above me. Not so unusual. Then I saw another and another and another. They were coming from all directions. West to east. north to south, south to north, east to west. I had never seen so many in one sitting in my entire life. Not even during the Leonoid shower of a few weeks ago. Colors ranged from green to white. I guess I saw at least one a minute sometimes two or three. A couple directly above left a trail that I could make out against the dark sky. After a while I came back in and after 15 minutes went out again and counted 11 more in about 20 minutes. I went back out at about 1:30 am 12/14/98 and didn't see any in five minutes so I came back in. Were we supposed to have a meteor shower last night? If not it was very unusual, but it was the most spectacular show I have seen in my entire life. I hope I didn't waste your time if I'm just reporting a typical meteor shower. ((NUFORC NOTE:  Sighting corresponds with beginning of Geminid Meteor Shower.  Not a waste of our time.));36.4935;-86.5964
