My husband and I were sitting on our front porch in Baxter, TN (Putnam Co, right off of I-40, exit 280. About 70 east of Nashville.) Th;2004-08-09 20:15:00;20 minutes;My husband and I were sitting on our front porch in Baxter, TN (Putnam Co, right off of I-40, exit 280. About 70 east of Nashville.) There was a very bright light directly in front of our house, southwest sky. I nor my husband paid much attention to it at first. My husband says it got brighter and this is when he first started noticing it. I didn't start noticing it until it started moving. It had sat still for 10-15 minutes and I thought it was a star. Although there were no other stars in the sky at the time, I didn't think anything about it. It started slowly moving upward. We watched with passing interest although it was much brighter than planes or stars. My husband said he saw it blinking, I never did. It continued upward, then went very quickly to the west (right). We got up from our chairs and walked to the edge of our porch to get a closer look. It quickly started going upwards again and then VANISHED! We both were freaking out! It wouldn't have been such a big deal but for such a bright light to vanish was a shock to our senses. No idea what we saw.;36.1251;-85.6416
