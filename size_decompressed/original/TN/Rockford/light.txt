Strange lights over Maryville/Knoxville.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible twinkling star??  PD));2014-05-04 22:50:00;30 minutes;Strange lights over Maryville/Knoxville I was washing my hands at the sink at about 22:50 on Sunday may the 4th when I looked out the window at the sky as I noticed an extra bright what looked to be a star.   As I watched closer, I noticed this star was making small circular motions in the sky almost doing figure 8's in the sky.   I went to go alert my wife about the light and as we both stared out the window at it, it began to flash different colors, red/white/blue/purple.   Then after about 15 minutes of watching, 3 smaller blinking red lights began flying straight towards the larger light and as they approached the larger light and made contact with it, they changed direction and continued flying.   I am unsure how long the light remained in the sky because I had to get to bed.  But it was still in the sky when I finally laid down at about 23:25.  This object appeared to be hovering in the sky East of Knoxville/maryville almost in the Smoky Mountains.;35.8323;-83.9451
