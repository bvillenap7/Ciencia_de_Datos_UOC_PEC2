Giant oval shaped shadow flies by on ground and disappears.;2012-01-19 12:00:00;5 seconds;Giant oval shaped shadow flies by on ground and disappears. My mother and I were driving down our road just talking and joking.In the middle of the conversation a huge oval shaped shadow passed over the road in front of the car.  I was shocked and said,  What was that!.   I looked out the window and there was nothing in the sky.  At the moment it passed over we were drivng on a road in between two long fields. I went to find out if anything like that has happened before.  On another website i found out that the same thing happened to someone on the same road exactly one year before.  I hadnt reported it at the time because I couldnt find the right site to report it untill now. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));35.8323;-83.9451
