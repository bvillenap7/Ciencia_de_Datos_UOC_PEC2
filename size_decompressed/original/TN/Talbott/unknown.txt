A circular object near a large airliner going on the same course.;2005-02-03 17:00:00;5 Minutes;A circular object near a large airliner going on the same course. I was in the backyard of my house watching aircraft through binoculars. I was observing an aircraft-I think it was probably a 767 or 777. I noticed a small object about 5,000 feet below the 767 or 777. At first, I thought it was a small regional airliner. Looking at it, it seemed to be circular. It may have been a trick of the light, but I doubt it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));36.1601;-83.414
