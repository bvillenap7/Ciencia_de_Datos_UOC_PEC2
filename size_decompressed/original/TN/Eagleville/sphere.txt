UFO hovers over tree line sending out smaller crafts.;2002-01-03 03:30:00;10 minutes;UFO hovers over tree line sending out smaller crafts. I work for a local newspaper. I was out delivering a country route , out in the middle of nowhere. I had stopped to get a drink of my soda and looked up into the night sky. I caught a glimpse of a white streak across the sky. Then a few seconds later, I saw a round, spherical (or oval) object hovering over the tree line about 10 miles away. It moved up, down and side to side, in quick movements. It rotated and as it did, it would change colors from white to green to orange. Every few minutes, I would see a disbersment of 1 to 3 tiny red streaks, like smaller crafts. They flew away from the main UFO and in different directions. It was silent and stayed there for about 10 minutes, then it vanished into the sky as quickly as it came.;35.7508;-86.6350000000001
