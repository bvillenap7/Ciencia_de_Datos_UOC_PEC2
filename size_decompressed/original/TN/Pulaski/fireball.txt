Fireball craft with multiple sightings.;2012-01-08 20:30:00;10 min;Fireball craft with multiple sightings. We live on a high elevation in our county in a wooded lot.  We see the fireball regularly and its the point where we are getting scared. Last night it was extremely lower than usual, and followed an almost direct heading of North East to South West with stops in its path.  The object has no sound, but I thought I could hear a faint hum like a pulsing hum because it was so low. After a while the craft will accelerate and leave sight, and since we're so high up we can see it for quite a while on the horizon. The object normally returns after an hour or so, and follows the same path.  Some of the previous sightings it had no path, but would *play* around in the sky with full horizontal/vertical movement but at some point it super accelerates from view. We live in a small town and someone from work asked me if we were shooting fireworks on some nights, because they noticed a fireball over our hill.  We live in the country with no major airports for 100miles or so. The only camera we have is cell phone, and camcorder but neither do well at taking pictures.;35.2093;-87.0393
