Was letting my dog outside and looked up at the sky to see if any stars were out, and saw an airplane.  Near the airplane was a white light that moved away from it toward the east, then it shot back west really fast making an almost loop.   I was able to watch it for a few seconds before it just vanished.;36.4679;-83.5543
