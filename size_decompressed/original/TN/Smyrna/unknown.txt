Yellow Dot, 200 mph, Dissapearing after a minute.;2011-03-28 19:00:00;One minute;Yellow Dot, 200 mph, Dissapearing after a minute. I saw this particular ufo about twice.  It was a glowing yellow, and made no sound.  It was going about 200 mph.  I saw it for about a minute, on each day. I'll also mention some other odd cases later, were I'm not sure what was going on. If you decide to call, 6:00 to 7:00 would not be when I want to talk.D: ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));35.9698;-86.5060999999999
