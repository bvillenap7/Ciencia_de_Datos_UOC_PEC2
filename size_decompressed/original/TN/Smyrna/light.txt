Bright light in SW sky, colors flashed in full spectrum rapidly, like a police light, but included every color in rainbow, RGB colors;2003-03-15 20:30:00;3hrs;Bright light in SW sky, colors flashed in full spectrum rapidly, like a police light, but included every color in rainbow, RGB colors What first appeared as a bright star  or  approaching airplane to the SW sky, series of changing colors that seem to flash like a police light. But range of colors included full spectrum rapidly changing colors. Moved very slowly in sky but the flashing lights changed rapidly. Moved to slow to be a passing plane, too many colors. I asked neighbor had he ever seen lights in sky like that... never. Neither had I. Lights too bright to make out detail but was the brightest light in sky several hours. Seemed to rotate with stars but continously flashed a full spectrum of colors.;35.9698;-86.5060999999999
Stationary light looked like a star or planet moved across the sky and turned into what looked like a cigar shaped craft;2012-06-24 20:00:00;3 minutes;Stationary light looked like a star or planet moved across the sky and turned into what looked like a cigar shaped craft My daughter and me were leaving from Smyrna, TN heading toward Murfreesboro, TN on Murfreesboro Road (that part of the road changes names but it's all still Murfreesboro Road). It was around 8 pm June.24.2012 we were still in Smyrna and had just gotten off the ramp by the Nissan plant heading toward where Florence Rd crosses over. *I'm being specific for anyone else who witnessed this in the area. We noticed a single bright light in the sky which we thought was a star or planet (I was sure of that) because it was just sitting there not moving at all and it looked like any other typical star/planet that you'd see on any given night. As I was driving (maybe 2 or 3 miles later) my daughter said it looks like it's moving, I said it could be us driving and it just looks that way. But then to me it did look like it was slightly moving. All of the sudden it began to travel across the sky and downward, gaining speed. I said what the hell? Then I started thinking it was a meteor but I couldn't figure out why it was sitting in the sky like that? After it went from the left to right side of the road and was headed more downward I then pulled over (I was about a quarter mile past Florence Rd). The bright light went out and some smaller lights appeared around it and I could now see a long dark cigar shaped object. It slowed down almost barely moving to a complete stop for about 10 seconds and the lights were changing around the object (changing as in where they were located and from flashing to not flashing) all appeared to be small white lights and then took off again with great speed which I have never seen a plane do and went out of sight just that fast.  I have tried to think of what this was, but after cycling though rational explanations I am left with none. Someone had to of seen this besides us. This object when the bright light went out was very large, we couldn't see the object before that because the light was very bright. I didn't see any wings and there was no sound.  Again I'd like to point out: 1. It was stationary and looked like a star/planet nothing unusual about it. 2. It then moved very fast across and downward falling like a meteor would. 3. The bright light went out and we could see a long dark object with no wings or sound and smaller lights appeared around it. It looked like a mist/veil type glow was around it. Maybe a thin cloud? 4. It hovered, traveled very fast,moved slow and came to a complete stop (things which a plane,star,planet,meteor does NOT do! At least I have never seen anything have movements or abilites like this.;35.9698;-86.5060999999999
Three orange lights like embers in sky.;2014-06-06 21:00:00;10 minutes;three orange lights like embers in sky. Three amber colored lights floated around each other with an irregular pulsating of bright and dim light.   No sound and traveled faster than a plane that flew through them.   They were hovering around and just disappeared without defending to the ground.;35.9698;-86.5060999999999
A bright, large light in the sky near an airplane that was preparing to land. It quickly disappeared.;2015-04-17 18:30:00;5 seconds;A bright, large light in the sky near an airplane that was preparing to land. It quickly disappeared. I was driving on Weakley Lane and witnessed a bright, large light in the sky.  A plane was nearby preparing to land at the airport.  The light moved a little bit, then quickly disappeared.  The object was behind the plane.;35.9698;-86.5060999999999
Large White Light larger than any star moving very fast.;2019-11-10 00:20:00;6 seconds;Large White Light larger than any star moving very fast. Smyrna tn Almaville road at 12:20 a.m  a large white light 3 times larger than the north star almost as bright as a street light that would be 15 feet from you moving toward the ground slightly faster than a falling object. If it were a plane it was most definitely 100% a crash at that speed straight down the light was white not yellow and there were no blinking lights. Moving at a higher than falling speed straight down. Scared me so much I got lost coming home on a road I drive every day. very shaken up. I almost exspecting a loud boom as if it would have hit the earth very hard but heard nothing. I drove The Direction toward it for about 15 minutes and never saw it again.;35.9698;-86.5060999999999
