It glowed in a bright fluorescent green. I am a 23-year-old, full-time college student majoring in psychology at Middle Tennessee State University. I live in Smyrna, Tennessee--about 30 miles southeast of Nashville. On March 9, around 9:00pm CST, in the western sky, I saw a large, spherical object slowly descend in a diagonal until it disappeared behind the tree line. It was BRIGHT--a fluorescent green so bright it almost appeared white. It was LARGE--much larger than anything I have ever seen traverse the sky.  Most unusual, though, it descended the sky relatively slowly--much slower than any shooting star that I have seen.  I saw the object for 3 or 4 seconds.  When it descended below the tree line, I expected to hear a boom or something--I thought that it might have been an burning airplane.  Local news gave no mention of the event.;35.9698;-86.5060999999999
