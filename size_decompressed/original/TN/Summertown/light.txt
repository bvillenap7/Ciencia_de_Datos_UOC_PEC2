Flat silver and red 'barber pole' flat object in northern sky;2011-01-16 19:00:00;5 seconds;Flat silver and red 'barber pole' flat object in northern sky Sunday, January 16, 2011, approximately 7 PM, My self and two friends were traveling north on highway 43 a few miles past Summertown Tennessee headed towards Mt. Pleasant, Tennessee.  The road was a rural by-pass divided 4 lane.  Conditions were over cast with high fog.  The object appeared directly in front of us, high in the sky. It was bright, shiny liquid appearing silver flat object that turned red then silver, again.  Silver on the bottom, red, then silver on top, repeating like a barber pole, but flat.  It cycled 4 times then faded away.  Myself and both passengers witnessed this and one passengers son who lived in the area reported the next day to his dad, that he had saw it, also.  I looked for photos on the web and found one that appeared over China airport last summer to be similar.;35.4321;-87.3216
