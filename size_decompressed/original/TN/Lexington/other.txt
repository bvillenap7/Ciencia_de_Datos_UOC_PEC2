I told them no its too early for a shooting star its not dark yet its only 8pm. About 2 minutes later they said.. there's another one.. so I looked that time. It was a silver bullet shaped object going across the sky at a fast rate of speed, first I thought it was a plane, but then noticed it had no water vapor trails behind it. My 17 yr old girl went in the house to get the camera to take a picture. We tried to get a picture of several of them but for some reason they would not show up on camera, but we did get a picture of 11 of the 20 that came over the house all traveling in the same direction. The objects at first were only coming over about every 2 to 5 minutes then after about 10 of them, they were occurring about every 30 seconds to 1 minute. At times there were 2 of them in the sky above the house. Two of the objects were changing from red to black.  All of the objects were traveling from west to east. We live in a small town and in my years I have never seen this much air traffic in a 30 minute period. Only 2 planes came through and they both had water vapor behind them and they were not traveling in the same path as the other objects;35.6491;-88.3945000000001
