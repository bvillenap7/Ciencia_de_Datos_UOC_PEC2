OBSERVED 4 LIGHTS, HIGH ALTITUDE, SUPER-FAST, TRAVELING STRAIGHT ACROSS THE SKY IN LESS THAN 20 SECONDS;1998-11-17 21:03:00;20 seconds;OBSERVED 4 LIGHTS, HIGH ALTITUDE, SUPER-FAST, TRAVELING STRAIGHT ACROSS THE SKY IN LESS THAN 20 SECONDS I WAS STAR-GAZING WITH MY TELESCOPE WHEN I SAW A FLASH IN MY LENS. I IMMEDIATELY SPOTTED AN OBJECT WITH MY BINOCUALRS. LOOKING DUE NORTH INTO CASSIOPEIA  I SAW 4 FAINT, WHITE LIGHTS. AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS AN AIRPLANE WING BUT REALIZED THE LIGHTS WERE MOVING AT A 45 DEGREE ANGLE IN FORMATION. I COULD NOT DISCERN IF IT WAS ONE LARGE OBJECT OR 4 CRAFTS TRAVELING TOGETHER. THERE WAS NO SOUND. IT TOOK AS LITTLE AS 10 SECONDS, BUT NO MORE THAN 20 SECONDS FOR THE OBJECT TO TRAVEL FROM NORTH TO DISAPPEAR INTO THE SOUTHERN  HORIZON. I WAS STUNNED AT THE ALTITUDE AND SPEED OF THESE LIGHTS. LATER, I WONDERED IF MILITARY JETS HAD BEEN IN THE AREA, BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN JETS AT THIS SPEED.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615
Orange lights in triangular formation.;2012-05-11 20:20:00;5 minutes;Orange lights in triangular formation Traveling down I-75 South approaching Emory Road Exit.   Saw 7 orange lights in a triangular formation.  Some of them had a blinking light on them the same color. As we drove under them they appeared to dissappear.  We stopped at the Weigles and got out but it was so bright with all their lights we could see nothing.  We left and got back on the interstate but did not see them again.  Opened window but did not hear any sound from them.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615
10 orange lights in formation vanished in a matter of seconds.;2014-04-27 20:45:00;2 minutes;10 orange lights in formation vanished in a matter of seconds. At 20:45 in the eastern sky of fountain city my wife and I witnessed approximately 10 orange lights hovering over the tree line in a staggered formation.  In about 5 seconds the formation completely shifted around as the objects moved up and down and back and forth.  In a matter of two minutes each individual light vanished without a trace.   I work for the Knoxville police department and my wife is in the military, we know a normal aircraft when we see it and this was definitely not something we had seen before.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615
Several UFO's in Knoxville Tennessee included is a military helicopter.;2014-10-17 19:00:00;20 minutes;Several UFO's in Knoxville Tennessee included is a military helicopter. I looked up and saw something falling from the sky that looked like a fireball at first as I continued to look at the object it changed shape then a long disk shaped object approached it from the east at the same time another disk shaped object approached from the west along side this there was a smaller object that was oval and lit up red appeared and disappeared then all the objects vanished except for the one that appeared to be on fire falling slowly and at that moment a military helicopter flew close to this thing falling from the sky I heard no noise from any of the objects except for the helicopter when all of this was happening hundreds of bats were flying around acting crazy I've lived here five years and never saw one single bat until this also all of the dogs in my neighborhood were howling and freaking out and I heard a lot of car alarms going off all at once my husband and his brother both saw all of this I have pictures of the crafts on my phon!

2 blinking red lights, no sound. Moved slowly east, disappeared and a comet like light shot out of the cloud.;2015-09-24 00:00:00;30 seconds;2 blinking red lights, no sound. Moved slowly east, disappeared and a comet like light shot out of the cloud Sitting on front porch having a conversation, when I looked up and noticed 2 red lights sitting in the sky towards the east.  As I told my friend to look up I noticed they were moving very slow.  As they progressed towards the east they moved as if they were connected by something, and the two lights were sort of rotating on a large axis, not independent. They both blinked, like the red lights on a tower.  Same speed, same intensity.  At this point I thought it was 2 helicopters chasing eachother, but they moved too slow and there was no sound.  One blinked red, the other red with very faint white lights in between each blink.  As they continued to slowly move east they started to fade.  Once they began to fade they seemed to spread apart, as if they were two different crafts afterall.  The very moment they disappeared into the clouds a bright comet like light shot out from the same spot into the opposite direction, directly over head. To add the this, once I went back inside to use my phone, none of my apps worked, as if I had no signal or WiFi connectivity.  But all signals were good.
