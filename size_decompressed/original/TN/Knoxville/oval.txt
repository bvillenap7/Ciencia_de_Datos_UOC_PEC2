West Knoxville Bright Blue Object;2011-09-30 19:35:00;5 min;West Knoxville Bright Blue Object This is my second sighting of this object. First time was back in Jan 11. about 7:30pm also.  Bright blue object.  Extremely bright blue.  First time I tried to get a neighbor to see also but no one was home. This time my neighbor came out and saw also. What is crazy is it is over a heavily populated area of West Knoxville.  I can't believe there isn't more response.  Object makes no noise.  Fly's in every direction quickly.  First time a spotlight shown down onto the ground from object but I did not notice it this time.  I have video from both nights also but from a cell phone so not very good. Very interesting. I would just like to know if anyone else saw this.  Is it a toy???  No plane can fly like this.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615
Oval Shaped Bright Blue (like LED bright) moving above populated area;2011-10-18 20:00:00;5 min.;Oval Shaped Bright Blue (like LED bright) moving above populated area I would describe the night as clear, there was a storm coming in from the south, but it hadn't reached our area yet. My son and I were heading home from taking care of our horse.  As I was driving, I observed Jupiter in the sky to the front right of my car. As I rounded a curve in the road, I noticed a extremely bright blue light thru the tree tops to my left.  I have driven down this road countless times in the past year and I knew that light wasn't there before.  I said to my son what is that blue light over there, do you see it?  He replied ya, I see it.  I don't know what it is.''   We then came to a point in the road where we could pull on a side street.  We sat there for a minute and watched in wonder.  This bright object was moving from side to side, even doing a figure eight. I drove a little further down the street to get closer to it.  We sat and watched it for another minute, then it just blinked out.  Gone.  And before I could say anything, it was back, bright as ever, just in a different spot.  I'm sure this was the same object we had been watching. To me, the shape was oval, but there was a time or two when it moved it almost seems to get longer.  We had the windows in the car down,there was not any noise that we could hear. Ok, so I really wanted the validation of another person.  I tried to flag a car down, they wouldn't stop.  Cant say I blame them, but that didn't stop me from flagging another car down.  He did stop. I said thanks for stopping, and i know this is going to sound crazy, but do you see that blue light up there? as i pointed to it.  He looked and said yes. I said don't you think that it looks weird, the way its moving?  I believe his reply was   I think its a police helicopter.   Um.... Are you kidding me? My father is a pilot, fixed wing and helicopter.  I grew up in a plane. I'm pretty confident I could figure that out myself if that was the fact.  The guy was still watching the object and then he says maybe it a searchlight, ya know, like when a new place opens and they want to draw attention.    Well, Im pretty sure those lights just don't stop and make a oval in the sky.  There was no ceiling....no clouds. Nothing for the light to bounce off .  Disappointed that the guy wa! s not as amazed as we were, I told him thank you for stopping, and he drove off.  I hope he got down the street and looked up at it one more time. We rushed home to get the camera, but of coarse, it was gone when we returned.  I even dragged my grumpy husband out of the house to go driving around to look for it.  Im bringing my camera with me from now on.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615
Approx. 7-8 orange orbs flew in arc above Knoxville, Tennessee, 11/1/2013;2013-11-01 22:00:00;not sure;Approx. 7-8 orange orbs flew in arc above Knoxville, Tennessee, 11/1/2013 Around 10 or 10:30 p.m. Friday, Nov. 1, 2013, I was walking my dog in my parents' yard in West Hills.  It was a clear night. I looked up and saw about 7 or 8 orange orbs in the sky.  They flew silently and in such even formation that it was as if they had a string attached between them.  They arc'ed up, but not too high in the sky, flying south. My father and mother were in the yard and also saw the flying objects.  When we got inside the house, Dad called the local newspaper to see if anyone else had reported the flying objects, but no one had.   A few days later, I called the airport traffic control center.  They don't handle this kind of thing and suggested calling the UFO hotline.  That's how I came to this site.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615
Glowing Red Object in the Night Sky.;2014-09-24 22:25:00;1 minute;Glowing Red Object in the Night Sky I was standing out on my patio looking up at the sky. I love looking at the sky at night.  I saw something moving across the sky, going west, at maybe 1500 to 2000 feet above tree level. It was oval shaped, and it was a glowing red color.  It moved in a smooth fashion, straight, and there was no sound at all. I yelled for my wife and son who came out and saw it, as well.  We watched it for about a minute before we couldn't see it anymore due to trees and buildings. I don't drink, don't do drugs, and I've never seen anything like that before.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615
