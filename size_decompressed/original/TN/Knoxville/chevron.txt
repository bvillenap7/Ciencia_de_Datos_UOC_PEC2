300 ft Flying wing followed by fighters, later observed by glowing ball.;1987-11-23 19:45:00;20min;300 ft Flying wing followed by fighters, later observed by glowing ball. Observed large craft at altitude of perhaps 1000 feet directly overhead.  Shaped like flying wing.  3 Lights, one on nose, one each wingtip.  Wingspan was 250-300 feet.  Speed was 20-30kts.  Followed in car for a couple minutes before getting out of car and getting up to second story of apartment complex. It was not a KC-135!  Object crossed over I-40 from N-S before heading West and out of sight at a moderate speed.  Within 10 minutes 2 fighters entered area low (3-4000ft) and at high speed from different directions and departed to the West with afterburner.  Total time observing was over 15 min.  Less than two hours later an object which seemed spherical was observed traveling S-N cycling between green and red.  It came to a stop and gained intensity staying red before departing to the East at high speed.  Total time was approx 4min.

Shallow Boomerang sighted in E. TN.;2005-05-30 22:50:00;10;Shallow Boomerang sighted in E. TN. While traveling to work going south on u.s. 129, at 22:50 hrs., I noticed a large, blood red, light in the east.  While continuing to observe, I also noticed a strobing red light next to the large blood red light.  THese lights were on the nose of the craft, and on each wingtip were smaller white lights.  On the wingtip opposite of the strobing red light, one of the wht lights was also strobing. The craft was approximately 200'-250' in altitude, and approximately 100' from wingtip to wingtip. THe craft was moving sort of like a hummingbird, or bumblebee, (I later handled a mag. lev. globe @ Walgreen's which was very reminiscent of the movement of said craft). I rolled down my window to listen for noise, which was difficult to detect over hwy. noise, and heard nothing from the craft, but noticed two smaller planes approaching from aproximately from the s.e.. THe craft was hovering, and seemed to keep it's nose toward my vehicle, tho this may have been an illusion created by the shape and length of Alcoa Hwy. (u.s. 129). I also noticed a feeling of electricity in the air, and mild interference on the radio in my car. This craft dissapeared suddenly, while I had looked away for a second to check the road.  I looked back in my rearviews, and it was just gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.  PD));35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615
