triangular shape hovered over our heads;1989-06-01 05:30:00;5-10 minutes;triangular shape hovered over our heads I was watching a tv show earlier about ufo sightings and I found it quite interesting due to the shape of the ufo and the dates of similar sightings...around 1989. You see, around 1989 my brother and I both saw a ufo. Basically, we were standing at the bottom of my cousin's driveway (In Knoxville, TN), waiting for the school bus.  It was always our waiting spot so we were standing there waiting for our cousin's to walk down the driveway.  It was your average morning when my brother and I just looked up and saw this ufo hovering just a few feet right above our heads.  It's an event I'll never forget because that night I dreamed the ufo shot rays down at my brother.   My memories are vague to two brain tumor surgeries I had a few years later but I asked my brother about it years later.  He said it was triangular shaped and had lights all around the bottom of it.  I know there was no noise whatsoever nor was there any wind.  It was just the huge, silent thing above our heads... In my excitement,I ran up the driveway to meet my cousin's shouting, Did you see that? The reply was,See what?  I turned around and walked back down the driveway to my brother where I asked him, Where did it go?  He simply said,It just flew away.And that was that. The reason I'm writing now is because I saw the show on the tv and they said there were several ufo sightings around 89, which was or was about the same year we saw it AND it was triangular shaped too.. We never really told anyone about it except for my cousins and family.  My parents never believed us and still don't.  My cousin believes me although she didn't see it.  I just wanted to tell someone ....Thanks for your timeâ€¦ ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615

We both notice thi;1997-06-10 16:00:00;1 minutes;Myself and a friend was traveling north on whittle springs roads.  As we approach the stop at the corner of edgewood.  We both notice this craft in the sky right over the intersection.  It was triangle in shape and massive in size.   It was very close to the ground..I would guess maybe 400 yards.  It was so close and so massive I could see the detail i the ship.  It did not look like it was made of metal,  It look more like it was made of some sort of stone and had hieroglyphic type symbols on the base with round bright lights underneath them.   My friend stops the car as we both have our head out the windows observing,  I would guess the whole incident lasted about 1 min.  Hard to say because it was almost like we was under a trance as we look but was prob just in shock.   I remember we pulled into the parking lot about 30 feet away to get out of the car and the ship started to move very slowly heading east.  I never seen the ship fly off though, it moved east slowly and then just was not there anymore.  We have told very few people about this over the years in fear.  But if anyone else remembers seeing this in the Knoxville area around that time please note.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615

MUFON/TENNESSEE REPORT:  I have inquired the FAA office in Knoxville as to the possible report;2004-04-19 07:15:00;10 MINUTES;Follow-up from MUFON Asst.State Director of Tennessee Kim Shaffer I have inquired the FAA office in Knoxville as to the possible reporting or recording of an anomoly that morning. The FAA spokesman was very helpful but was fairly certain that Brisish Airways flt,272 was inbound for Atlanta at F.L. 340 and makes it's turn for Atlanta near Knoxville occasionally. This flight ,due to altitude and sun angle at that time of morning, has been reported to them before as a vertically ascending anomoly.

Unusual contrail in early morning sky ((NUFORC Note:  Contrail?  Just a guess.  PD));2004-04-19 07:15:00;10 minutes;Unusual contrail in early morning sky What I saw cannot be classified as a flying saucer, but it is definitely an unidentified flying object.  This sighting occurred this morning as I was driving home from work. It was a beautiful, clear morning with the usual crisscrossing contrails in the sky. As I entered the interstate, I-75 northbound, I noticed an unusual contrail rising vertically from the horizon. I pulled over, looked up through my windshield, and saw that the contrail continued straight up for about a third of the visible sky and then made a 20 to 25 degree course change to the left. I followed the path of the contrail until I could see that a small, triangular shape continuing to travel almost vertically into the morning sky was making the contrail. It looked like a rocket on a path into the stratosphere. I watched the object moving upward until its altitude was such that I could no longer see it. The contrail dissipated until only the initial vertical contrail was still faintly visible it remained so for about another ten minutes. As I continued my drive homeward, I could see the vertical contrail straight ahead of me in the northern sky.  There are no large military bases in this area from whence a rocket might be launched. The only base is an Air National Guard base located to the south of the city. Is it possible that I witnessed a rocket launch that originated at a distant location?  This was definitely NOT an airliner or a typical military jet. I see those almost every day and I am quite familiar with their characteristic contrails. This was quite different. I would appreciate an opinion as to what I might have witnessed this morning. Thank you. ((NUFORC Note:  Contrail?  PD));35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615

A white triangular shaped object flew over 25 ft from the ground.;2015-08-27 22:00:00;3 minutes;Myself, and my husband were outside watching the asteroid show. This was supposed to be the big night.  We had watched for a week now, and this so far, had been the best night at seeing the shooting show.  We were facing true NORTH, in our front yard, practically laying down.  We live in the country, away from lights.  My husband jumped up to check some traps on the other side of the property.  As I continued to look up, right over my head a white triangular shaped object flew over 25 ft from the ground. No noise no lights, I screamed do you see that twice, screaming.  I watched as it flew to the Nort/east direction. Maintaining its level with the ground.  I couldn't believe it. Explained it over and over. Husband said it was a droid probably, he don't believe it was solid. It was a solid triangular shape, sort of like a Chevron-like.  About 3.5 feet across the widest part.  I saw it.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615
Large triangular metal object hurling through the sky.;2016-01-28 14:00:00;20 seconds;Large triangular metal object hurling through the sky. At approximately 14:00, I was on my back deck.  I saw a triangular shaped metal object moving at a high rate of speed.  It looked like a silver more streamlined Stealth bomber.  It was tumbling end over end, the bottom was flat and shiny like chrome and the top was dull and bulged out in the middle like a cockpit.  Other than that there were no remarkable details that I could see.  The object was moving northeast.  There was no smoke trail or other trail behind the object.  Because of its velocity, I moved indoors because I was afraid there might be a sonic boom.   There was no boom in my area, but I saw on Twitter last night that there were sonic booms heard in parts of the northeast shortly after I saw this object (confirmed by USGS).  It had to have crashed somewhere it was spinning out of control. I was by myself.  As a hobby I keep my eye on the sky observing airplanes, satellites, astronomical objects, cloud formations, etc.  I've seen mid-air refueling, Air Force One, satellites, and shooting stars from my deck, but this is the first time I've seen something I can't explain.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615

Four triangular craft seen stationary in the sky over South Knoxville, TN;2016-06-08 17:58:00;5-10 seconds;Four triangular craft seen stationary in the sky over South Knoxville, TN Disclosure begins with me, right?  Hereâ€™s what happened:  It was a little before 6:00 PM on June 08, 2016.  I was leaving the Chapman Highway Big Lots in South Knoxville, TN.  As I recall, the parking lot was nearly empty.  I was alone.  It was sunny.  As I approached my car, I saw four white, triangular craft stationary in the sky to my right.  They were identical.  They seemed equally spaced as if in formation. I would estimate the encounter was between five and ten seconds.  I had enough time to notice the craft, process that they werenâ€™t normal, retrieve my phone, access the camera, and take two pictures.  Yes, this story is corroborated with pictures. I cannot speak to how the craft moved.  I was distracted by my cell phone.  I heard nothing.  The encounter was silent.  They disappeared as suddenly as they appeared.  In the photos, the craft are definitely on the move.  They went from 0-gone almost instantly.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615

Boomerang-Shaped UFO glides silent and dark over Knoxville;2020-10-13 20:30:00;10 seconds;Boomerang-Shaped UFO glides silent and dark over Knoxville I was with my girlfriend earlier this week. No airfields or bases were around our location, though there are both most likely in a 25 mile radius. We were in a big empty open field near her house that we like to go to often and sit and talk when she gets out of work and doesn't have enough time to do much else before going home. This night, a Tuesday, approximately 8:30-8:45 pm, the sky was clear with not even a cloud in sight. I had the idea of getting out of my car and looking at the night sky to see how beautiful Mars looked. Because there were no street lights around, one could see the whole sky in full in all its glory and beauty. We were talking, saw a shooting star, and then continued conversation for another few minutes. Then we laid on the hood of my car and I noticed this little grey cloud above us. I didn't think anything of it besides wow, only one little cloud and nothing else. I turned my head back towards her for roughly 5 or 6 sec! onds as we continued talking, and then we both happened to look up at the same time and she quit talking as we were both dumbfounded as to what we were witnessing. At first I thought the stereotypical its a bird but the wings were not moving. Then of course maybe its a plane or a drone. I said to my girlfriend, babe, do you see... and she said I'm looking right at it. It was a U shaped craft, more like a boomerang, the width of maybe a large bus, gliding completely silent over us. It looked otherworldly. Translucent. I felt like I could almost see through it yet it was solid. It was gray, but blacked out with no lights and if any clouds were above it I swear it would have been invisible. There was no smoke or anything behind it. It was just this blacked out huge silent boomerang about 100-150 feet above the treetops on the outskirts of the field gliding and ZIG-ZAGGING from left to right, yet staying completely flat. Just as q! uickly as it came, it went. Directly afterward, a dog in the d! istance and same direction the UFO had traveled began barking very loud and uncontrollable. I told my girlfriend to research boomerang shaped UFO right after we determined we have never seen anything like that in our lives, and we found this webpage, https://www.huffpost.com/entry/boomerang-ufo-zigzags-ove_b_6221676. This was the closest thing we could find to describe what we had experienced, except for the fact that our siting had no lights, yet the one on this webpage did. That is about all I can tell you about the experience, it was the most bizarre thing I have ever witnessed and I have no clue what to do about this experience but to tell someone. Thankyou.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615
