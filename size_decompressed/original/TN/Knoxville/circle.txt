2 white objects traveled a long distance faster than any plane could have done.;2000-05-09 12:00:00;do not know;2 white objects traveled a long distance faster than any plane could have done. I saw no objects, but I have 2 photographs of them.  By this I mean that I did not see anything at the scene and only saw them when I got the film back.  I have 2 objects on 2 frames of film. They are small in the frame, but they traveled a large distance within 1/3 of a second.  There were no aircraft in the area at the time or I would have heard them. I head NOTHING that day. That's one reason I did not see them. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615
Large seemingly round object burning up with tail that dissipated towards end of sight, too big to miss,orange tail;2003-10-18 17:00:00;2 minutes;Large seemingly round object burning up with tail that dissipated towards end of sight, too big to miss,orange tail My wife alerted me to something she saw in the sky to the south, southeast of our home saying  Honey, What is that thing in the sky?.  I was working on my truck and didn't want to get up for nothing because of back problems, but with her insistence I got up and looked toward Maryville, TN  There was an orange ball falling from the sky with a tail (orange)that was traveling at what must have been an incredible speed.  If you would stretch your arm out and compare the distance between your forefinger and your thumb, it was about an inch long. This object had quite a tail on it for the first 45 seconds or so, then it seemed to dissipate to a certain extent as the object came further towards the ground but the tail flared up in the same orange color on several occasions. At this point I would have to guess its altitude at 2 miles, maybe less. I figured that maybe it was a satellite coming out of orbit, but the funny thing is that it was very close to McGhee-Tyson airport.  I called them and they said they'd seen nothing at seven o'clock, Saturday, October the eighteenth, two thousand and three.  The guy I talked to seemed interested and said he'd call me back. For whatever it's worth, we saw this very thing and it was cool. I've never seen anything like it except in movies or science news. My background is that I've always loved the sciences,fairly smart and am happy that I witnessed this falling object that no one seems to know anything about. Thanks. Wish that I'd have gotten my camera but I thought it would be on the news about a satellite going down or a meteorite.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615
bright white light in sky moving slowly to southeast.;2009-05-28 21:45:00;3 minitues;bright white light in sky moving slowly to southeast. Very bright light went across dark sky. It moved in a straight line from northwest to southeast.  It appeared to be pulsating from right to left. It got really bright then got small and turned orange then disappeared off in the distance.  No noise and appeared to be 20k to 30k in elevation.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615
We found this orb of light that is purple and cannot be seen by us, we also know it was way up in the sky.;2010-11-19 08:30:00;3 Mins;We found this orb of light that is purple and cannot be seen by us, we also know it was way up in the sky. I was out taking photos on the night of  Nov. 19. I took a total of five photos and the forth one was the only one that it showed up on. We did not see this mysterious object in the sky.  So the this object is very far up or possibly paranormal. It could be a U.F.O. We cannot decide what it is, or what to make of it. The first thing that we thought it was was a star, then we thought that stars are not purple.  Then we thought about an orb of purple light , like I said we cannot decide whether it is an orb of paranormal light or a U.F.O. We got this spot of light when we were taking pictures of the moon, and like we said we took about five photos and they were about three minutes apart and this one is the only one that it showed up on. Thank you for your help.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615

I observed what  I thought was a low flying plane, but as I approached I realized it was stationary and hovering.;2012-11-14 22:20:00;45 seconds;I observed what  I thought was a low flying plane, but as I approached I realized it was stationary and hovering. On the evening of November 14th I was driving home from in the western suburbs of Knoxville, Tennessee on Westland Drive.  I was headed east when I noticed what appeared to be a very low flying airplane in the distance. There is McGhee Tyson airport about 8 miles to the southwest, so I didn't, at that moment, think it was out of the ordinary, except for the altitude it was at.  For the next 45 seconds I had a clear view of this craft. I kept waiting for it to pull away and gain altitude, but as I got closer, I realized that I was gaining on it.  I slowed down as I got closer and realized that it was hovering about what appeared to be 400 feet above the road. It had two white lights on either side of what I first thought were the wings, with a red light blinking in the center.  As I got closer and closer, now only going maybe 20 miles an hour I had a totally clear view of this craft.  As I drove under it, only then was I able to see that it had an oval or rounded shape to the underside of it.  I really wanted to pull over, get out and observe this craft, but I was just a little freaked by the whole experience.  As I drove away I kept looking in my rear view mirror, but never saw the lights or craft again. I would really like to think that it was a plane or helicopter, as it was hovering, but I know of no plane that can do that and I've seen too many 'copters and it made no noise that I could hear. The exact location was on Westland Drive right across from A.L. Lotts Elementary school.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615
Orange ball of light disappeared and reappeared in cloudless parts of the sky three times before we lost it.;2014-11-30 17:29:00;5-10 minutes;Orange ball of light disappeared and reappeared in cloudless parts of the sky three times before we lost it. Driving down I-40 West we saw a higher than usual amount of planes flying in the sky.  All of the planes had jet streaks trailing out behind them, but then we saw an orange ball of light moving across the sky among them without streaks behind it.   It disappeared and reappeared in cloudless parts of the sky three times before it finally disappeared for good.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615
UFO on Chapman Hwy Knoxville, TN.;2015-08-02 23:15:00;5 minutes;UFO on Chapman Hwy Knoxville, TN We were driving down the highway when we saw  this large circular object with large flashing red and green lights and a concaved center just hovering about 20 above the street light.   I pulled over right under it.  It had such a loud hum that my van was vibrating.  It just sat there for a couple of minutes then took off super fast.  Hovered there a minute then started coming back towards us.   I had grabbed my phone and took video footage.  The lights shown white in it.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615
Yellowish circular object moving in same region of space for more than three hours.;2016-05-19 21:50:00;3 hours;Yellowish circular object moving in same region of space for more than three hours. On the night of May 19, 2016, I observed what I thought was a satellite moving cross the sky until the object ceased moving in the approximate region of the stars Altair and Tarazed.  The object then began moving in a random zig-zag motion while staying in the same region of space.   I observed this for approximately 30 minutes before getting my camera to film and video tape the object.   Over the course of three hours I watched and took approximately 30 pictures and 10 minutes of video before clouds moved in and obscured my view.  The object is circular and orange in color.   When magnifying the image the object takes on the color spectrum ranging from orange, yellow, green, and purple.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615

I noticed that there was a very bright blue colored star that I had never seen before.  ((NUFORC Note:  Celestial body??  PD));2018-01-22 20:00:00;>1 hour;I was just sitting on my front porch smoking a cigarrette when I looked at the sky as I normally do and I noticed that there was a very bright blue colored star that I had never seen before.  The more I watched, i noticed that it was moving, but very little.  It's altitude stayed pretty much the same but it was bouncing from side to side as if to steady.  The blue light is not star blue, rather, it appears LED.  But it is only blue, a perfect circle of blue emitted light.  For the past hour it has changed altitude and position slightly, but still in relative proximity.  My wife came out to watch and noticed yet another light within a couple of miles of the other.  Focusing in with a camera reveals that the light is luminated by what appear to be hundreds of small lights of different colors, yet primarily blue.  I have see an oval and one cone in my lifetime.  They were both hauling some serious ass.  These ones un-nerve me, because they are so stationary, in what seems a strategic distance apart.   If i could elevate myself in my current position, I fear that I would see more of them in a line.  This has been going on for an hour now, and they have yet to break position.  Pictures are unfortunately on my camera because my phone will not zoom in to that altitude..  Which says A LOT because six days ago I was able to zoom in on the FEMA cargo carrier that landed at McGee Tyson, and be able to identify it from 15,000 feet.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615
Me and my sister saw a strange light rise up from the horizon, move like I have never seen any aircraft move, all while making no noise;2019-08-04 21:00:00;5-10 minutes;Me and my sister saw a strange light rise up from the horizon, move like I have never seen any aircraft move, all while making no noise Me and my sister were walking our dogs around 9-10 o’clock at night when we saw some sort of circular light rise up incredibly fast from the horizon.  It looked like a circular white light with a smaller red light towards the top of it.  It seemed to have a slight disc shape, but due to distance and my glasses lenses, it was hard to tell if it was a glare from my glasses or simply a blur from the distance.  It made no noise. it stopped in place for a few moments before beginning to accelerate incredibly quickly and make super smooth and quick turns.   It was hard to tell the speed of the object, since it was so far away, but it did go significantly faster than any aircraft I have ever seen before and it was silent.  It continued in that pattern, occasionally stopping in place.  Eventually, it disappeared behind some trees and emerged a few minutes later, but this time it was blinking like a plane would, but it continued the irregular movements from before.  It disappeared again behind the same trees and then soon emerged again, now it wasn’t blinking but was a solid light like before, but we saw it change to start to blink again.   It then drifted back down to the same general area it initially rose up from, and me nor my sister saw it again.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615
