Unusual lights in sky moving and fading out.;1999-10-27 23:55:00;40 sec.;Unusual lights in sky moving and fading out. Observed unusual lights moving across sky as I stepped outside of my home at around 11:55 PM. I noticed a bright light moving from the south to the north first appearing  at about a60 degree elevation from the horizon as I faced west. The light appeared elliptical in shape from my perspective, consisting of a  bright golden glow with 3 distinct equidistant points of light within the elliptical shape. Size and distance were difficult to judge. It moved very quickly  across my field of view. The lights did not resemble any aircraft lights I am familier with. After watching it for about 15 seconds, the glow began to slowly dim, taking 3 or 4 seconds to become completly dark leaving only the 3 point lights visible. The brightness of the point lights diminished slightly, but remained visible for several seconds until dissappearing behind trees. No sounds were audible during observation. Light were last observed heading north/northeast.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615
A strange noise scared the shit out of me and I would like to know why these beings picked me.;2002-02-26 05:00:00;45 seconds;A strange noise scared ((deleted)) me and I would like to know why these beings picked me. I was in bed when I heard a strange noise. It started out really low but soon became really loud. It sounded like an airplane was right above my bed. It scared ((deleted)) me. I am still trembling. I decided to post this online because I didn't know what else to do.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615
Large object moving slowly without sound, close to ground, small light on front and flashing light at rear;2006-12-16 19:00:00;3 minutes;Large object moving slowly without sound, close to ground, small light on front and flashing light at rear Stepped outside of our house and noticed a large mass a little SW of us in the night sky.  We couldn't make out the shape, but it had a small red light in the front and a flashing white light in the back.  It was moving NE at a very slow speed, and had no sound. It seemed very close to us, and very large.  Our first guess was blimp, which would explain the size and lack of sound, however we couldn't find any reports of blimps in the area and there were no sporting events.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615
Four short and closely grouped contrails observed in clear skies;2008-10-22 15:55:00;1 to 2 min.;Four short and closely grouped contrails observed in clear skies On October 22, 2008 at approximately 15:55 while traveling west on Interstate 40/75 between mile markers 379 and 376, I observed what appeared to be three relatively short jet aircraft contrails grouped closely together traveling in a southwest direction  The sky was clear.  Other long contrails were visible in other areas of the sky, particularly to the south.  The altitude of the three contrails seemed to be similar to typical jet contrails. The three contrails seemed unusual to me.  The contrail lengths were relatively short compared to others in different areas of the same sky.  The two most westward contrails were relatively close and in parallel.  A third contrail was close behind.  After observing these objects for about 20 to 30 seconds, it then appeared that there were actually four contrails.  The fourth contrail seemed to be close to the forward two.  The flight paths were apparently straight and the movement seemed to be consistent with high altitude aircraft speed which I have routinely observed. These contrails apparently were evaporating rather quickly.  After about 60 to 90 seconds after the initial observation, the contrails disappeared, one by one.  The last one observed was the trailing contrail. At this point, my initial impression was this phenomena could have been some type of debris entering the earthâ€™s atmosphere and breaking into three or four relatively large pieces.  I was not able to determine if the contrails were actually due to aircraft.  I did not have access to any type of optical devices or cameras.  There was no observed points of light associated with the contrails. There was one other observer besides myself.  My background is in chemistry and radiological safety.  The other observer is a registered land surveyer. My question would be, Has any local radar station observed these objects at this location and time and made any identification? A response via email would be welcome if this observation warrants an investigation.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615

I know they were not stars because of the overcast.They were not planes because of no flickering of lights.  The radio was on so we could not hear a sound.  We were sobe so I know we were not seeing things.  Very strange.  I have never seen anything like that befor nor had my friend.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615

We were traveling south and they looked like they were going north. We only saw them for about 10 to 15 seconds.  They were not blinking or or  colored.  Radio was on so I don't know if there was a sound.It was just a strange thing to see.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615
Brilliant bright light seen above high altitude airplane with no plume then disappears over Knoxville, TN.;2012-11-17 17:00:00;10 seconds;Brilliant bright light seen above high altitude airplane with no plume then disappears over Knoxville, TN. Traveling 275 to I-40 West, approximately 5pm, right before taking the Alcoa Exit, noticed a high altitude aircraft toward the West with a white plume behind it.  In perspective, approximately 1-2 inches above this aircraft was a brilliant white light, shape unknown, with no trailing plume, which the light became even brighter than before, then completely disappeared. I believe this was too close to be another airplane.  Also, if it was an airplane, it would not have disappeared. It did not have a trail of any kind. I was the front passenger in the car, and was telling the driver, my sister, to look at the object, and why it did not have a plume, when it completely disappeared.  She was driving and did not see it.  We were traveling to UT Medical Center with 2 grandchildren to see my new grandchild.  I have never seen a UFO before. I am 55 years old, have been a Registered Nurse for over 30 years, and have lived in Anderson County most all of my life.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615
Two slow-moving red lights, flashing in unison, in a loose, staggered formation.;2016-10-26 23:30:00;15 minutes;Two slow-moving red lights, flashing in unison, in a loose, staggered formation. On 26OCT2016, at approximately 2315 EDT, I heard several instances of noises coming from outside of my house.  The noise that most caught my attention was similar to someone riding a skateboard on pavement but was accompanied by a notable amount of low frequency energy as a steady drone, no rhythmic interruptions, just a Doppler effect as through passing slowly by my observation point.   After the third such occurrence in an estimated 15 minute window, I exited my house and attempted to locate the source of these aural events.  Upon looking to the northeast sky, I observed two slow moving, flashing red lights in what appeared to be a loose, staggered formation traveling away from my location in a northeast direction.   The lights pulsed with only a saturated red color in a slow, steady pattern, similar to a communications tower at night.  They were quite intense, despite the perceived distance but were not blinding--certainly brighter than any aircraft I've witnessed.  The lights also flashed in perfect unison with each other but, given the distance separating them in the sky,  I have no reason to believe they were in fact attached to the same craft.   The only sound witnessed as they departed was a low frequency rumble similar to that of a distant freight train, or high powered jet engine.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615
