Star shaped craft flys right over my head slowly at 60 feet, on Easter 1990.;1990-04-15 00:05:00;35 seconds;Star shaped craft flys right over my head slowly at 60 feet, on Easter 1990. I had been working on a oil painting all day and into the night and ran out of cigarettes around midnight, I went for a walk to the Exxon gas station located behind my apt, at the corner of Cherry street and Magnolia in East Knoxville. It was a clear night. As I was walking out of the gas station with my cigarettes and back across the parking lot I had this funny feeling to look up. When I looked up there was a star shaped craft flying right over the Exxon sign. The craft was about 60 feet up flying about 15 mph, I immediatly knew it was a UFO and ran to the sidewalk to get a better view, it flew right over my head, travelling east to west, the street lights on Magnolia lit up the bottom of the craft. It was star shaped, 4 pointed, approx 35 feet long, 30 feet wide, highly polished grey metallic, the points appeared conical, curving from point to point, it appeared thicker in the middle approx 5 feet thick, it had no lights flashing, no windows, no landing gear, no engines, no lettering or numbers on it and it made absolutly no sound as it flew down the street into downtown Knoxville. It had just turned Easter at the time of the sighting. I watched the craft go down the street untill it vanished into the darkened sky. I felt totally in awe seeing and watching the craft. I dont use drugs or drink and am a professional artist with 5 years of college training in the arts. I went back to my apt and told my roommate of the sighting and he laughted in my face, eventually I told my parents and they as well thought I was nuts. I was 27 at the time of the sighting. Thats it.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615
MUFON/TENNESSEE REPORT:  Possible explanation of Knoxville sighting;2004-04-08 23:40:00;5 to 8 minutes;Possible explanation of Knoxville sighting Peter, This is a follow-up  on this sighting. I spoke with this gentleman via e-mail and he described having seen this object on concurrent nights and that is moves in relation with the stars, I believe that Venus, our favorite ufo, may be what this witness has reported. He told me himself that he thought that it may have been a planet or star after seeing it the next night.

Reddish Orange glow in night sky over next ridge.;2004-04-08 23:40:00;5 to 8 Minutes;Reddish Orange glow in night sky over next ridge. I work Mid-night to 8am and I was out feeding my dog and was a little late getting to work. But while my dog was eating i was looking northwest at next ridge over from mind. I live on a ridge at a 1300 feet elevation and was looking over to next ridge about 3 miles away and about 5 to 10 degrees above ridge was this reddish orange glow in sky moving slowly away from me. Looked like a camp fire in sky, flickering like a camp fire would do. Till it went out of site.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615
Silent white light expands and blinks out over head at night.;2006-09-14 19:00:00;minute;Silent white light expands and blinks out over head at night. I was in the yard, with my dogs, watching two stars on my left (i was facing south) when a neighbor came up the alley walking his dogs, as he left and my dogs calmed down, I resumed looking at the two faint stars (no stars were very bright) when almost directly overhead, a white star ? appeared.  It grew, large.  To put it in scale, if all the other stars were pencil lead points, this grew, within seconds, to the comparable size of a quarter.  It was silent, and seemingly as far away as the other stars.  When it expanded to it's fullest it blinked out.  It didn't shrink back, or splinter into sparks, it just ceased to be.  I've watched the sky since and haven't seen even a star in that spot.  There appeared just faintly around the edge of the light, a blue haze, very faint and very thin.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615
4 UFOS;2011-10-08 03:30:00;10 min.;4 UFOS I saw 4 UFO's not moving in the air for at least five minutes.  Just hovering the whole time.  OCT 8th 2011 3:30pm in Knoxville, TN, above my house.  Clear sky and they were silver. I went inside tried to find camera came back out and 3 were gone.  The last one started moving very slow and when I tried to look in my binoculars to see it and then couldn't see it so 5 seconds later when I pulled them from my eyes it was gone.   I do not know who to go to or to see if anyone else around me seen the same thing.   I tried to take a picture with my phone but you cant really see anything but 3 of them and they just look like dots in the sky.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615

Gray floating objects. One with reddish glow below.;2012-06-29 20:45:00;3 minutes;Gray floating objects. One with reddish glow below. June 29, 2012 Approximately 8:45 PM. The sun was down but there was  sufficient light to see the sky. Walking outside on Kingston Pike in Knoxville, TN. near the 3700 block. TN. Looking in the eastern sky. Saw multiple gray objects appearing to be floating down. Looked like parachutes but no one was below them.  They were close enough that had there been lines and people below the parachute I would have seen them and there were none.  One had a reddish glow below. Almost like the light of a fire. They did appear to be drifting downward to the north. There were several groups of them. Maybe 3 or 4 per group. They descended below the trees and went out of sight.  Two other people observed this with me. It lasted for several minutes as when I first saw the gray objects no one else was near me. Then two other people came outside and I pointed the floating objects out and they saw them as well.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615
Bright White 2 Dimensional Circle intercrossing Jets flying in single file on sunny day.;2014-09-14 17:00:00;seconds;Bright White 2 Dimensional Circle intercrossing Jets flying in single file on sunny day. My husband and I were sitting on back porch when 2 jets passed over in front of us. We watched them go Eastward.  I kept watching them and following the jets with my eyes and head and could still hear them as they went by us and now I could see their tail ends, when all of a sudden a white flat circle that was brighter than the white clouds flew across (intercrossed) the tail ends of the jets.  My husband quit watching the jets as they had crossed over him.  He just slightly turned his head to watch them.  The jets were flying one behind the other keeping perfect spacing between each other.  I followed the bright white circle until it went behind a tree that obstructed our view.  The white Circle didn't go behind the tree on purpose, it was just a big tree that was on the side of the house that blocked my view.    My husband watched me stand up and follow the circle with my eyes and he turned to see what I was looking at and pointing at, that's when our view was ob! structed by our tree. The circle was flying as fast and steady as the jets and was very high in the sky. It was a perfect circle, brighter, whiter than a cloud. It looked flat almost like a orb dancing in your vehicle from jewelry or a watch that the sun reflected off of.  The circle didn't fly behind the tree on purpose it was just a big tree beside our house that blocked our view from seeing the circle any longer.  The circle was moving as fast and steady as the jets and was very high in the sky. There was no sound from the circle.  I don't know if the circle came out from a cloud next to the jets or where it came from.  I just began seeing it come from the right side going to the left side of the back end of the jets.  It was a sunny day.  Yes, there was some clouds but sun was shining and the wind was blowing.  My husband didn't see it because he didn't react fast enough and the tree obstruction didn't help.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615
Irregularly shaped object slowly shrinks into nothing over I-40.;2017-11-06 20:40:00;30 seconds;Irregularly shaped object slowly shrinks into nothing over I-40. Was driving home with my girlfriend and I spotted what I thought was a large flag on a strangely tall pole from interstate 40.   It was irregularly shaped, and had an orange hue from the city lights maybe.  We looked at it for about 15 seconds and decided it was just a cloud.  That was until it began to get smaller and smaller over the course of 10-15 seconds before disappearing completely.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615
Six orange pulsating spheres moving across horizon and then slowly disappearing;2018-05-04 21:40:00;5 minutes;Six orange pulsating spheres moving across horizon and then slowly disappearing Observed 6 to 7 orange pulsating lights on horizon.  I was facing north and they were moving southeast.  One started moving down and then slowly disintegrated.  One by one they all slowly disintegrated.  This lasted approximately 5 minutes.  Each one looked like 2 glowing orange spheres joined together and pulsating rhythmically.   I kept trying to make sense of what I was seeing.  I checked with the national weather service and the wind was traveling 3 mph in a southwest direction at that time.   Please let me know if others have reported a similar sighting or if it is determined what these are.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615
Bright orange oddly shaped object sighted near Knoxville, TN.;2019-07-19 23:35:00;5 Minutes;Bright orange oddly shaped object sighted near Knoxville, TN. At approximately 11:35 p.m. on the night of July 19th, 2019 I observed an oddly shaped orange light in the sky above northern Knox County, Tennessee.  The object was substantially brighter than the surrounding stars, and was approximately 30° over the horizon.  The object held a stationary position for around five minutes before something behind me caught my attention.  I looked back immediately to find it had disappeared. Judging from the direction and height of the object it may have appeared overhead in or around Northern Tennessee.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615
I saw eight independent, irregular-moving glowing objects cross the night sky.;2020-11-12 18:20:00;8-10 minutes;I saw eight independent, irregular-moving glowing objects cross the night sky. Sighting occurred right after sunset.  At sunset, I noticed two strange sunbeams emanating in a V shape at the western horizon.  I took a picture of it.  Once the sun completely set, I saw the eight objects appear.....in the same vicinity as the two beams I photographed about 20 minutes earlier.  The objects started out in a V formation....and primarily appeared to be a flock of geese, but they emanated a translucent iridescent glow that caused me to stay focused on them.  As they progressed across the sky, the formation changed to single file, then a circle, then a hopskotch-type action.  I realized they were definitely not geese, and thought maybe they were hangliders....each with a candle-type glow.  Their movement was haphazard as they got right above me....some were stationary for 20-30 seconds while the others circled them in no specific pattern.  It was as if they were being playful with each other.  Rea! lizing that their altitude was too high for a hanglider, I wondered if they were some odd type of parachutes(that glowed)....but when they started ascending....one after the other....I knew they were not.  They emitted no sound whatsoever.  They seemed to be headed for the heaviest cloud-cover in the visible sky.  Once they were obscured by the cloud cover, I lost sight of them.  I took several photos, but only two of them showed pin-point-type lights.  What I saw was not lights powered by a known energy source.  They glowed with a translucent, iridescent light....all white...no color...no blinking. I cannot believe that other people did not see this anamoly.  It was very visible, and the sighting lasted about eight minutes. There is no explanation.  Too high and quiet to be drones. The stop/start/fast/slow irregular nature is inexplicable. I will never forget it.....and wonder what -if any- relation they had to the two strange pre-sunset beams that shone from the western horizon.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615
