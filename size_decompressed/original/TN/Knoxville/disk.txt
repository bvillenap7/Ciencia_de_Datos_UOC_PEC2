Two disc shaped objects flying in tandem;1977-09-15 18:00:00;5 minutes;Two disc shaped objects flying in tandem  This is the first time I have officially reported a sighting.  It was in the fall as best I remember it was 1976 or possibly 1977.  I won't go into the details of how I arrived at that date - I do not actually remember the exact date.  I had gone to my parent's home to pick up my son - he rode the school bus and stayed at their house until I got off from work.  They needed a few items from the grocery store (about a mile and a half from their house) and I volunteered to go get them.  My son was with me.  As we drove down the road, I saw two  ojects in the sky.  They were flying at tree-top level. They made no sound. They were silvery in color.  The looked like two saucers laid rim to rim.  They had red, white and green lights. The white lights were around the middle - windows were also visible around the middle.  I stopped the car - flashed my headlights - and watched them. Nothing happened.  I continued on my way to the store.  I asked the cashier at the store if she saw the UFO's and she looked at me as if I had two heads (or no brain) and has yet to answer,  I decided at that time not to pursue it any further. I could see no movement inside the closest craft although it seemed as if I could see in the windows.  The next day an article was in the Knoxville News-Sentinel relating a similar sighting in a nearby county by two police officers.  They described the lights as patriotic - red, white and blue.  I did tell my parents of the sighting. My mother scoffed.  My father stated he saw them all the time in the back yard in the evening when he was feeding the animals.  A few years ago, I remembered that after I flashed my headlights (which I had to turn on to do so), and continued down the road that I had to turn on my headlights as it was now getting dark.  I don't know if any time was lost - my parents didn't say anything about being gone a great length of time.  They are both now deceased so it will be impossible to get that input.  My son says he still remembers the UFO's - he was about 8 years old at the time - he will be 39 this August. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Object traveld along side my car for a mile a close range.;1986-10-15 19:00:00;25 minuites;Object traveld along side my car for a mile a close range. This event happen several years ago in 1986. It was at dusk in October of 86, I was going out that evening to se a friend of mine. As I left the house to walk to my car i saw a bright yellow light about 100 yards in the feild across from my house. I figured someone over in that area had new street light, but it was like a brighter yellow than any of the other lights in that area. It was close to a sub division, so i dismissed it. As I got in my car & pulled out of the drive way, the light came tward the car. As I traveld up the road I lived on the object traveld with me, along side my car! I drove up the street about a mile, I could see that the object was disc shaped, silver, with the light coming from the underside of the object. I had to navigate up a hill, & when I did, The object shot stright up at a unbeliveable high rate of speed. At that piont I could see under it. It was round now with a series of blueish lights. Being shook up at this piont, I drove a quarter of a mile to a church & stop my car. I got out & sat on the hood & was smoking a cigerate. Thinking about what I had seen. As I sat there, a few minuites later I saw this disc again. This time it was decending back to earth, & disappered behind a set of trees. It made no noise at all. At this piont I could of done 1 or 2 things. I could go back down the road, or get the hell out of there & take the highway. I got the hell out of there.

Disc-shaped object spotted seen about 15:00 hrs. for a duration of about 4 minutes.;2007-04-09 15:00:00;4 minutes;Disc-shaped object spotted seen about 15:00 hrs. for a duration of about 4 minutes. It was a beautiful day as I went to pick up my mail at the mailbox which is at the end of a rather steep driveway. When I was walking back up the drive, I turned to take in a deep blue sky with large cumulus clouds. That is when I saw a large disk-like object sitting next to a big cloud in the southeast at approximately a 35 degree angle. It looked a little shiny because it was probably reflecting the sun from the SW. I would estimate that it was about the size of a large, commercial plane. It did not move for about two minutes, but then moved very slowly to my left and stopped. When it started to move to my right, there was a bright flash of red light from the bottom of the craft. It continued to move slowly to the south until it disappeared from my view because of some trees.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615
Sighting of a saucer in broad daylight in Knoxville, TN.;2011-11-17 15:30:00;about 1 minute;Sighting of a saucer in broad daylight in Knoxville, TN. I was taking a walk in a local park around 15:30,clear sky above my head, when through the trees surrounding the path,   I watched a set of yellow-orange lights, arranged clearly with one long, base light and three curved rectangular lights which appeared thinner, resting on the top of the slope of cerulean blue material that connected these lights.  The upper layer of lights extended past the edge of the bottom one, which appeared more rounded than rectangular.  I watched the craft leaving no contrail, and then, suddenly, jolting to a stop, it begin to move forward in waves, like it was being tossed in the wind.  Upon chasing after it, I lost sight of the object and have not relocated it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
