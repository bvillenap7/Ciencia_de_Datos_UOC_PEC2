Multiple bright flashes of light with no sound, enveloping sky with light.;2012-04-20 05:00:00;1 hour;Multiple bright flashes of light with no sound, enveloping sky with light. Witnessed multiple flashes of light, extremely bright and lit up entire sky completely.  There were booming metallic sounds off and on prior to flashes, but not in sync with the flashes of light.  There were no clouds and a completely clear night.  These flashes enveloped the sky with light and were brighter than any lightning I have ever witnessed, and were completely silent.  (The booming noises were minutes before and in between the flashes but never in sync).   I proceeded to call my fiance' who was travelling in a rural area of southern Kentucky that morning and she saw the flashes at the same time that I did.   We saw them simultaneously three times, spanning about a 5-10 minute period.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615
Green flashes/strobing in the western sky;2012-10-07 21:45:00;10 seconds;Green flashes/strobing in the western sky. Did anyone report a bunch of bright green lights flashing in the sky?  I have never reported anything like this but it was real weird.   My wife dismissed it as a bunch of laser pointers until she saw it for herself about 30 seconds after I saw it.  It was in the western sky from here in halls and it was a bunch of flashes all over like a crazy christmas tree in the sky. Ill remain nameless right now, lol;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615

White Flashing Light in the Sky Not An Airplane.  ((anonymous report));2017-09-30 21:00:00;15-20 minutes;White Flashing Light in the Sky Not An Airplane At around 9 pm (EST)my husband left to go to the store, and my son and I went outside because it’s a beautiful night out.  I’m always looking up at the sky, and tonight I see this thing that looks like a star, but it’s blinking, on and off.  It’s not moving like an airplane. But it did move.  I went inside to get my camera and when I came back out I couldn’t find it.  My son spotted it.  It had move higher up, but it still was not moving like an airplane would do.  And it was still blinking, on and off.  Flashing.  Blink. Blink. Blink. And it’s not like the twinkling of a star.  This was brighter, and a more pronounced flash, with a pause between the flashes. We went in around 20 minutes after 9 and it was still up there flashing at that time. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
