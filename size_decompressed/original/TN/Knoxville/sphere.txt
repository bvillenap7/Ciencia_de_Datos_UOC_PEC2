Bright object observed slowly moving to west when another object (with red glow)  was emitted and departed at a high rate of speed.;2004-05-31 23:00:00;20 minutes;Bright object observed slowly moving to west when another object (with red glow)  was emitted and departed at a high rate of speed. At approximately 11:00 pm on 5/31/04 my wife and I went outside to get some luggage from our car parked in the driveway.  Our driveway faces almost due west.  I noticed a very bright object toward south of the driveway which was moving horizonally at an elevation of approximately 40 degrees above the horizon.  I pointed this out to my wife and she commented that it must be an airplane.  We watched for several minutes and I pointed out that there were no other lights ( red or green) as normally seen with aircraft.  She said the object looked like a sphere with a halo adound it.  She went into the house to get the binoculars and I continued to watch the object which continued traveling toward the west at a slow rate of speed.  The moon was very bright and was at an elevation above the object and east of the object approximately 30 to 40 degrees.  Only a few stars were visible to the south an these were much higher in the sky.  At this point something very strange happened. A bright object ( not nearly as bright as the original sphere ) eminated from the sphere and traveled at a very rapid rate to the east at an angle of 120 degrees from the path of the bright sphere.  This object ( much smaller than the original sphere) had a faint red glow to it.  It continued moving at high rate of speed in a straight line until it was no longer visible at an elevation of approximately 75 degrees above the horizon almost due south.  I returned my attention to the original object which was no longer moving to the west but appeared to be moving away from me as the size continued to get smaller. It also appeared to be slowly gaining altitude above the original elevation when moving to the west.  I continued to watch the original sphere for another 10 to 15 minutes. At this time the original object was much smaller and not nearly as bright as when first observed.  I stopped looking at the object at about 11:20 pm.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615
MUFON/TENNESSEE REPORT:  Follow-up on Knoxville sighting;2004-05-31 23:00:00;20 minutes;MUFON Follow-up on Knoxville sighting Peter, I followed up on this case by contacting the FAA  supervisor at McGee Tyson airport who could find no notes in the station logs for anomolies either by radar or reported by pilots or civilians during this time frame. Also, searching current available data, there were no satellites or orbiting vehicles that fit into this sighting as a possible explanation. The witness is highly qualified and very credible, being a pilot and aerospace engineer(ret).The object(s) described were obviously at a great distance or were not distinguishable by radar.I am sending a sketch by the witness of the objects he saw. Thanks again for your cooperation and assistance.

Large, spherical, solid black craft emitting a blue beam, followed by black helicopters.;2011-01-14 01:30:00;5 minutes;Large, spherical, solid black craft emitting a blue beam, followed by black helicopters. Three years ago in Knoxville TN, my home town, I witnessed my first UFO.  What i saw changed my life, my perception of how i understood physics, and what i once viewed as possible and impossible.  I have always been interested in the paranormal, since my first memories i can recall an interest in ghosts, spirits, angels aliens etc.. but overall i am a pretty sound and logical person.  The details of my first sighting were pretty much exactly the same as what is described by eyewitnesses of the famous Phoenix lights, but that's not why I'm here.  I'm here because this morning at 1:30am, I witnessed something that frightened me to my very core.  Unlike my other UFO sighting experiences in which i was not frightened, just fascinated and curious about the possibilites of what i was seeing i felt a combination of peace, warmth, and awe. what i witnessed tonite was completely different.  I had just gotten home from a little late night shopping at wal-mart.  The time was around 1:30am and i was walking out of my bathroom and down the stairs to my basement to smoke a cigarette, when i heard a very loud rumble as if a tornado was directly over my home.  It was such a loud humming/rumbling sound that i could literally feel the vibration from it.  Curious, i walked out my front door expecting to see a helicopter flying directly over or a low flying jet, but... that is not at all what i saw.  I open the door, and directly in front of my point of view was an ENOURMOUS, solid carbon/black perfect circle shaped craft hovering extremely low and close to my home. The sound was loud enough that i'm surprised... better yet shocked that it didn't wake the whole neighborhood.   Again, this thing was huge.  In the dead center of this giant circular craft (Which i could see almost perfectly, and it had no wings, no landing gear, no strobing lights and no visible markings of any kin! d) was an extremely bright laser like lighting blue beam pointing in several different directions. I have to admit, i was frightened by it, but i wanted to document it somehow. Now, i own a video camera, but i keep forgetting to purchase new film, and did not have any in it at the time, which REALLY sucked. So, since option 1 was out of the question i ran to get my iphone from off my counter top. Here's what is strangest part of the story. By the time i got back outside with my phone in hand, this thing, this craft, this... sort of ominous eye of god ship had left. I could still hear it, it was still very loud, and knew it had to be near by. Mind you, I was in the house for all of 15 seconds searching for my iphone. I ran as fast as i could in house shoes around to the back of my house hoping to catch a final glimpse. This craft (or whatever you want to call it) had traveled several miles north, and all i could see was the faint remnant of the beam shooting out of it, and i! t was rotating up and down and back in forth as if it was sear! ching fo r something, and then it dissapeared behind the ridgeline, although the noise emminating was still very noticeable. Wait it gets weirder. SO i hear another loud rumble coming from behind me, althought this sound is familiar. I look up, and there 3 black helicopters with only their spotlights on in formation flying along the same path the craft took, as if they were chasing after it. These choppers were hauling major ass. I knew i had just witnessed something i was not supposed to see. I will remember this day forever, and the unusual ominous sense of fear i got from witnessing this thing. If you would like, i am a bit of an artist, i could send a detailed sketch at a later date. Thank you for your time.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615
7 orange orbs flew across the sky one at a time in the same path, appeared out of nowhere, and faded away.;2011-12-25 19:00:00;10 min.;7 orange orbs flew across the sky one at a time in the same path, appeared out of nowhere, and faded away. On the evening of Christmas day I was told that I needed to quickly come outside. I saw a orange sphere traveling across the horizon from west to east.  The object made no sound at all and moved much faster than the wind could carry it.  It was moving slower than a plane but fast enough for me to tell that it was being propelled by something. after about 15 seconds it disappeared. Then another one appeared in the western part of the horizon.  It took the exact same path as the first orb, and faded away in the east.  I observed a total of 5 of these orbs traveling across the sky in the same way. The person who told me to come outside saw a total of 7 orbs.  There were a total of 4 people that witnessed this. It was the weirdest thing that I have ever seen. I have been trying to figure out what these were.  There is no possible way that these were Chinese lanterns.  They were moving way too fast, and they were following a straight horizontal path.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615
Half Red / Half Orange Sphere hovering in Knoxville TN;2013-02-14 06:00:00;10 seconds;Half Red / Half Orange Sphere hovering in Knoxville TN It was 6am, 2-14-13. The sky was still completely dark.  My bedroom which is on the 2nd floor filled with a bright light coming from outside.   I looked out my window and about 30 feet from me there was a solid bright sphere which was half orange and half red hovering 8-10 feet above the road.   You could cut a verticle line down the middle to separate the two colors.   The orange stayed on the left and red was on the right.  It was so bright that it was hard to look at it for more than a couple seconds at a time. It continued to hover to a height of 18-20 feet off the road and travelled away from me until I could no longer see it.   Total time watching it was about 10 seconds.  The ball was approximately 3 feet in diameter.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615
Orange light passing over Knoxville at 20:50, Sept 24.;2017-09-24 20:50:00;1 minute;Orange light passing over Knoxville at 20:50, sept 24 Orange light appeared between the moon and Saturn in the southwest. It showed up about two minutes after the ISS passed over.  Intensity was a bit brighter than the ISS but was about twice as large and orange colored.  It moved at about the same speed to the northeast directly overhead and did not strobe or blink like an airplane might.  After about a minute or two, the light disappeared.  It did not slowly dim like the ISS arid but rather winked out.  Looking at the small amount of video I took, I could not see the same color but did see a slight flash as it disappeared from sight.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615
