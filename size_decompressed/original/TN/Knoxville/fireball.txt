Green fireball falling from sky;1999-12-05 05:15:00;10 seconds;((NUFORC Note:  Object was reported from Birmingham, AL, and reported on WBRC TV news there.)) Green fireball falling from sky I had gone out for a cigarette, and was looking approximately South to Southwest of my position. I had just glance away from that direction, when a green flash caught my eye. I turned in the original direction and saw a green fireball with a tail, like a comet's.  I would say it was not more than 1/4 mile from me. It was not real large, I probably could have covered it with my thumb at arm's length. It was approxiamtely 100 to 150 feet in the air when I first noticed it.  I lost site of it seconds later as it went below the roofline of a hotel in front of me.  I listened for a impact, thinking it had to hit the ground, but heard nothing.  I called two hotels that faced the direction of the fireball, but neither saw or heard anything.  The fireball did not make a sound as it fell.  I don't know where it came from, it just suddenly appeared in my vision.  I immediately went in and wrote the basics of what I saw down.  Beyond this there is no more to add. Mr. Davenport,   As I was standing looking south to southwest, the object was coming from my right to my left. athough during the time I saw it, about 5 to 10 seconds it didn't appear to go very far.  It didn't shoot across the whole sky, but seemed to appear and then drop out of my sight in the same area of sky.  The tail came off the object at a 30 to 45 degree angle.  The object seemed to be falling slowly, I believe this is so because I had time to start seeing the object out of the corner of my eye (at which time it didn't appear to be to high off the ground) turn my head and focus on the object before it fell out of view.   Our local news reported it as a exploding meteor.   They also said that the object was seen as far as Alabama.  That strikes me as not possible, but you'd know better than I.  They apparently got calls all day long about the object.  Also our local airport, McGhee Tyson received calls about it. Should out local paper have an article on it in tomorrow's paper I'll forward that you. Sincerely  Mr Davenport, I posted a report to your page earlier this morning, Green Fireball in Knoxville, TN.  My name is ((name deleted)). I saw a news report after I filled out your form.  They said they had received numerous calls about a green fireball in the sky over Blount County, just south of Knox County.  Apparently I was wrong on how far it was from me, although it looked that close.  The local news is reporting as a (yep you guessed it) meteor.  This is my first siting of something like this, now I understand your cynicism about the news media.  I've seen meteor storms and such, never have I seen a green one.   I apologize if my report may be a little inaccurate, especially on the distance I thought it was from me, but it did look that close. Sincerely, ((name deleted));35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615
I saw balls of fire coming from the sky.;2002-11-17 03:00:00;20 minutes;I saw balls of fire coming from the sky. I was walking home from the city wide bar,and I looked up into the sky.I am not really sure what kind of light I saw but it was really bright.Within the next second,I thought I saw this ball of fire coming down into the earth,like a meteoriod,but I had not heard of any to be falling within last night.As I wached it move from left to right of the sky,I saw little flares of light coming off of the craft,as though it was entering this atmosphere.I ran home and got:my mother,my youngest daughter,my wife,and my girlfriend.They were all watching as the light was moving acroos the sky.So I knew I was not seeing things.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615
Large blue fireball reported in Knoxville, TN over Tuesday night, Nov. 28th sky.;2006-11-28 18:30:00;Ten seconds;Large blue fireball reported in Knoxville, TN over Tuesday night, Nov. 28th sky. The object appeared over the western horizon moving toward the east.   It was a huge fireball, blue in color.   It was unlike any shooting stars I have ever seen, which are usually white in color and appear but for a second.   This went all the way across the sky, breaking up into two or three pieces as it reached the eastern sky. It reminded me of the way the space shuttle looked when it broke up upon re-entry. It was the size of the blue fireball that impressed me most.   Something got very deep in our atmosphere, obviously. We had just come out of a restaurant.   My wife and I were meeting with another minister friend for dinner.   He saw it first and said, Look at that.   It was almost frightening because it lasted so many seconds, and it seemed so close.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615
Big reddish-orange (planet-looking) light hovering over Knoxville, TN during 4th of July festivities;2010-07-04 10:00:00;45 seconds;Big reddish-orange (planet-looking) light hovering over Knoxville, TN during 4th of July festivities I'm surprised that no one else mentioned this!   When I lived in Knoxville, TN in 2010, my husband, best friend and I were walking closer and closer to the river during the 4th. of July festivities in World's Fair Park to get a better look at the fireworks.  We kept walking and walking and walking until we got up to a neighborhood right next to the river, and we couldn't walk any further.  There were a whole bunch of people sitting on their front porches, sitting in their front lawns.....etc watching the fireworks.  There was a middle-aged man on the sidewalk with a pet boa constructer, my 19 year old friend was wearing a cute, white sun dress, and she (being the daring type of person that she is) asked the man if she could touch it.  It weighed about 70 lbs, and she was tiny herself, so I was very surprised and completely distracted when the man said, Sure, and instead, draped the gigantic snake over her shoulders, and she was totally freaking out.  I was kind of giggling and no longer paying attention to the sky and the fireworks when I suddenly noticed everybody walking out into the streets like they were mesmerized or something.  I didn't understand what could've been so wonderful about the fireworks, because I was getting bored with them and paying attention to my friend's nervous reaction.   I suddenly turned to my husband iand asked what the big deal was to notice that he was in a daze staring at the skies as well.  He pointed and said, &quotLook&quot while still partially in a trance.  I looked up, and there was this small, but distinctive, ball of a red-orange light that looked like it was far in the distance and getting bigger and bigger as it seemed to be quickly approaching.  I felt like I was dreaming but looked around to realize that everyone else was still looking at it too, which made me realize that it wasn't even close to my imagination!  As I looked back up again, I noticed that it was gigantic. Granted I di! dn't have my prescription glasses on at the time, but to me,  it somewha t resembled a small planet or something, and it seemed like it was so close that I thought that it was going to hit us.  Instead, it seemed as if it was hovering a little bit higher than a high helicopter right in front of everyone in the neighborhood, but over the water.   It hovered over there for a long matter of seconds, and suddenly (out of nowhere), it quickly darted off almost directly right and disappeared in a split second almost as if it never was really there.  Once again, I thought that I was imagining it, and realized that everyone was still standing around looking up at the sky for a couple of seconds after it disappeared. I mentioned that I wished that my son was there to see it as soon as I came to, and I looked back at my friend who still had the snake draped over her as if the snake was barely even phasing her anymore until she 'came to' again, and finally asked the guy to get the snake off of her.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615
Strange orange lights over Knoxville, TN;2011-07-04 21:15:00;60 minutes;Strange orange lights over Knoxville, TN While watching fireworks, a light caught our attention which appeared to be a flare at first. It was orange in color and seems to glimmer like a flame.  However, we begin to watch as it moved across the sky beyond our view.   It appeared to be high in the sky.  Roughly 10 minutes later another orange flare came across the sky following the same pattern almost, it too flew out of view as the first.   As it flew overhead, binoculars form within the house were obtained.  View through binoculars, the object was very hard to focus in on remaining blurry.   Approx. 10 minutes later another flew in about the same path and direction as the previous. This time, this particular orange flare was moving faster than the others coming from the same direction and going towards the same direction as the other.  (The direction these things were going was from the North - Northeast moving towards the southwest - sometimes turning west).  This one slowed down and appeared to come to ! a complete stop while still glowing orange.   A minute or two later, the item began to move in a western direction and slowly began to disappear until it was gone.  Once it disappeared, another came into view across the sky to the north again - it followed the same path.  This point was when the choice to grab the telescope was made.   However, as the telescope was being sought after, two more objects appeared outside. This time as one went across (same direction) another appeared across the sky in the direction they were coming from making visible two of these objects at one time.   These objects were photographed and caught on video (phone).  However, watching the video and film afterwards, it is very hard to see what was actually seen.  Describing the view through binoculars - the objects appeared to be an orange spot light moving from side to side almost.  It was very hard to focus in on the objects.  The sky was clear except for some smoke in the southern portion of the sky from t! he fireworks - however, these objects moved through clear skie! s.   When the one object stopped, we observed a plane flying from the east to west and appeared to be flying toward the direction however, when the plane flew by the object - you could tell the plane was much higher than the object.  However, it seemed weird that object slowed and stopped as the plane approached and as soon as the plane passed over head of the object, that is when the object begin moving in the westerly direction as the same as the plane, then vanished.  Further research on the internet mentioned items such as Chinese lanterns which may be possible - not sure because we have never seen them but the objects were weird as they seemed to be moving at various speeds and the one that stopped.  We have never seen anything like this before. The first two objects came from the North and traveled in a southwestern direction.  The remaining objects came from the Northeast and traversed in a southwestern direction except for the one object that stopped and changed to a western direction.  All objects except the first vanished or disappeared in the sky in view, while the first vanished behind the house out of view.   The object emitted no noise from at least what we could tell - there were fireworks going off in the distance and the booming of those were heard, however, when the plane flew by, we could hear that.  The objects were very hard to focus on and appeared blurry even through the binoculars however they were very bright in color and looked like flares in a way but without the excessive smoke or flame appearance flares give off - the same color though.   The first two were moving about the same speed and the third that stopped was moving very fast before it slowed to a stop.  The remaining was various speeds but no! t as fast as the third.  The items were viewed from about 2115 hours to approx. 2215 hours.   The objects appeared as circle type and blurry. We stayed out until 2250 hours waiting for more but no more were observed.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615
One spherical fireball which quickly died out leaving a dark, spinning mass that drifted southwest as it descended;2011-07-22 21:15:00;2-3 minutes;One spherical fireball which quickly died out leaving a dark, spinning mass that drifted southwest as it descended I am an RN case manager and musician and visual artist.  My husband is a computer scientist and jazz pianist.  We are avid bird and nature watchers.  We walk in our West Knoxville, TN, neighborhood almost every day. Tonight my husband and I just witnessed what might be described as a fireball in the Farragut/Concord area just southeast of Turkey Creek and Concord Roads at about 21:15 tonight. We were walking eastward on Turkey Creek Road just east of Anchor Park when we realized that the bright object in the sky above was not a helicopter or airplane.  The center of the roughly spherical object blazed bright orange at first.  It had a dark, slightly irregular outer edge.  It appeared to be spinning. This went on for maybe a minute at most and then the bright center quickly died out and all that was left was a dark, cinder-like spinning object, possibly spherical or disc shaped, that slowly lost altitude as it drifted roughly southwest and was lost to our sight as it descended in the direction of Northshore Drive.  It made no discernible sound. We do not know if there is any relation, but there has been a bad smell in the area this evening - possibly a chemical odor or the smell of something burning.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615
Orange flickering light in sky;2011-12-14 19:00:00;1 minute;Orange flickering light in sky We were leaving Brixx on Kingston Pike when I spotted an orange flickering light traveling horizontally in the sky toward Papermill.  I tried to watch it as long as I could, but keeping up with two children and a boyfriend that dismissed it as a lantern:  kind of drew my attention away.   It was definitely something you don’t see every day, and I would really like to know if it can be explained.   I was just complaining the other day that all these non-believers see objects all the time, and I’ve never seen anything.   I’ll just consider it a complimentary viewing after my request I suppose.

5-6 balls of light floating above the Mechanicsville/Middlebrook area, spotted from Alcoa Hwy;2012-09-07 23:10:00;5 minutes;5-6 balls of light floating above the Mechanicsville/Middlebrook area, spotted from Alcoa Hwy They moved so smoothly and with such perfect synchronization, almost as if on a puppet string. The light radiating from them was unlike that of a helicopter (our first suspicion).  It glowed like a ball of light, yet, you could still tell that it was an OBJECT.  You could also tell their position in the sky. THEY WERE NOT THAT FAR FROM US....maybe a mile away from us and a mere 500-700ft. from the ground. For these craft to be so close to the ground, they made no audible disturbances. (This would not be the case if they were government aircraft.);35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615
