metallic cylinder hovering above city.;1998-10-15 14:00:00;5 minutes;metallic cylinder hovering above city. A coworker and myself were driving west on cumberland ave. and i noticed over to the northwest approximately 1 to 1.5 miles away at about i guess 1000 or 1500 feet i saw a cylinder hovering in the sky standing on end motionless. I observed this intermittantly as we slowly moved with the traffic down cumberland. It was a hazy or overcast day is the only reason we noticed it because it appeared to be a gray matallic color and stood out against the background of the sky. I estimate its size at approx. 3 feet thick and about 12 feet in length. I am writing this 4 years later and i cannot remember exact date. Size and distance are my best guess only.

Two metalllic cylinders and an unusual plane sighted flying from SW to ENE and ENE to SW in Knoxville.;2000-10-13 18:45:00;2 minutes;Two metalllic cylinders and an unusual plane sighted flying from SW to ENE and ENE to SW in Knoxville. A bright metallic cylinder, seemed to glow- but this effect may have been sun light reflecting on its surface, crossed the sky from SW to ENE slowly. It made a sound like a dirigible that I heard before I saw it, very loud, but at the same time muted.It was a fairly high altitude--I would estimate between 5000--8000 ft.It went out of sight, and I thought gee I wish I could see that again. I looked up and a similar object was returning from the direction the first one went.The second one didn't make as much noise as it headed SW about the same altitude as the first. It crossed paths with a strange-looking white thing that looked like another cylinder only it had stubby, short wings that were nearer the tail than the middle of the craft.It flew ENE-no noise. We have had chemtrail spraying all dayand the white plane looked like what I've seen before connected with that activity.I am a fifty-one year old artist, a wife, homeowner,college.

Green and orange lit cylinder flashed across the sky while outside at work.;2006-04-20 22:40:00;3 minutes;Green and orange lit cylinder flashed across the sky while outside at work. I was at work on a break outside talking with a coworker the sky was clear and there was nothing unusual about it.  We were just talking when suddenly out of nowhere this huge cylinder shaped light appeared in the sky it was huge considering how far away it was and it moved across the sky diagonally southwest (FAST) then just as quickly as it appeared it was gone.  The front of it was green and then it tapered into orange, there was much more orange than green.  It wasn't a green object with an orange tail because the whole thing moved together as one object.  There was no noise.  The way it appeared it reminded me of shooting a bottle rocket.  Only it was huge.  And going down not up.  And it never exploded like a bottle rocket.  We both were silent for a few minutes and then we looked at each other.  I asked what that was, she said she didn't know.  I asked if she thought it was a plane.  She said no.  I said maybe fireworks.  She said no.  Then she said sort of quietly do you think it was a ufo?  I said no one would believe us.  We quickly put out our cigarettes and went back in.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615
Large white object in sky moving much faster than jet observed in eastern sky.;2009-03-07 17:30:00;20 seconds;Large white object in sky moving much faster than jet observed in eastern sky. It was still really light outside with the sun shining and the moon also out.  I noticed the moon up in the sky and noticed a jet really high up, a white jet, leaving a chemtrail, sort of to the right of the moon when I noticed a really weird object moving perpendicular to the line of the jet.  It was much higher in the sky than the jet and it was moving much faster than the jet.  It was either two objects moving at tandem or it was one object with some sort of color in the middle of the object making it seem like two objects.  This object was very white. It seemed much whiter than the jet and this object was moving so much faster than the jet it was unreal.  I stood and watched it for approximately 15 seconda when I came back into the house since I had no way of filming it.  I could not see any wings or tail on it. It seems to me that if it had been a jet that the darker area between the two objects or the dark area in the middle of the object would have not been in the middle of this thing since wings on a jet are not in the center of the plane.  They would have been closer to the front. I'm not sure what it was but I'm sure it wasn't an airplane or helicopter.  I could not hear any sound.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615
Craft gleaming in sunrise.;2012-08-22 07:12:00;1 minute;craft gleaming in sunrise I was driving East bound on Kingston Pike taking my son to school when above the sunrise there was a craft that was gleaming bright.  It was shining on the opposite side than where the sun would have been reflecting on it.  I actually passed up my turn because I was watching it.  I tried to take a picture, but the craft turned at what appeared to be roughly a 90 degree angle and all but disappeared.  The moment it changed direction I could just barely see a dark spot and then it was gone.  My oldest son saw this as well, but he doesn't want to believe.  Yes, I understand it could have been a plane, but it was the brightness of it that caught my eye.  There was also a helicopter flying in the same area as the craft.

Short, cylindrical craft that gleamed like a star, was illuminated briefly by the sun, and disappeared;2015-12-08 17:15:00;10-15 seconds;Short, cylindrical craft that gleamed like a star, was illuminated briefly by the sun, and disappeared Date:  December 8, 2015 Time:  5:15 PM, Eastern Standard Time   Place:  Knox County, Tennessee  Object was seen while this witness was driving westbound. It looked like a star at first, gleaming, but not huge in the sky. Then it turned towards my left (its right) and looked like some kind of craft. It was not a jet plane.  It looked more cylindrical. The waning sunlight allowed a brief observation. Then it simply disappeared. Amount of time observed:  Maybe 10 seconds 15 seconds max. There were several jets in the sky at the same time. Their contrails were visible.  This object had no contrail. In fact, there were three jets to the right (north) of this object, all with contrails. From the point of view of this witness, the three jets looked to be almost stacked in the sky. Then this witness had to make a turn onto a road heading north. When lack of trees allowed, I did glance over towards the area. All I saw were jet planes, maybe 8 or 9 of them going different directions. No sign of the object. Thank you very much.  Have a great day.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615
