light following a grid;1979-06-01 21:00:00;15 MINUTES;light following a grid I was about eight years old, we lived in Maynardville at the time. We came to Knoxville to get groceries. I spotted the white light high over the TN/VA sky, or so it seems. At first glance it looked like a dancing star, it looked as if it was on a grid. I mean ninety degree angles without slowing down or speeding up. My mother also saw it. I am convinced if such technology existed as it seems beyond what we have seen so far, including stealth. We would be utilizing it by now. It covered hundreds of miles in split seconds. I am 36 now and nothing so far comes close. I know what I saw, just don't know what it was.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615

Bright light attracts 8 planes;2003-10-15 20:30:00;30 minutes;Bright light attracts 8 planes At approximately 8:30 Wednsday night October 15, 2003 I was setting up my telescope and ccd with my daughter.  She noticed a bright light and asked me what it was.  It was below and to the left of mars(I was looking SE at the time)and shining at the same or slightly brighter magnitude than Mars.  I looked in my software to verify that there was not a star/object that bright in that area.  After I verified in my software(The Sky) that there was nothing of that magnitude other than Mars in that area of sky, I went to set my telescope up to try and photograph the object.  It was at this time that the object disappeared.  We then noticed approaching out of the east some red/blue blinking lights.  As they got closer we could tell that there was 8 planes flying two abreast.  Two continued heading west, two circled around overhead, two went south, and two more went north.  This continued on for about 30 minutes with the planes continuing to fly back and forth, always two side by side.  About 15 minutes after the first planes appeared, helicopters were heard but never seen.  The planes were witnessed by myself, my daughter, and my neighbor(who came out to water his dog) however my daughter and I were the only ones to see the initial light.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615
Five bright blue lights in formation streak across sky without making a sound;2006-11-28 18:30:00;5 secs;Five bright blue lights in formation streak across sky without making a sound I was taking my one year old daughter down to the end of our driveway to pick up our empty trash can, when I noticed a seeming change in the darkness around us, as though something was lighting up the night.  There are two houses being built beside us, so I thought that maybe a car or someone at one of the houses had turned on very bright lights.   As I was quickly processing this info, I happened to look up and saw five very bright blue lights absolutely zoom across the night sky, in single file formation, without making a sound.  When I noticed the lights, they were almost directly overhead, perhaps a few thousand feet in the air, and they disappeared after only a few seconds, as they vanished into the distance.   I could not tell whether they simply flew out of view, or actually turned off, but they had obviously been visible before I noticed them overhead, as their light was so bright that, in the few seconds before I looked up, I had felt their light all the way down to ground level.  At the same time, a neighbor across the street was out on her porch, calling her dogs in, and after they disappeared from view, I asked her if she had seen the same thing I had just witnessed.  She said that she had.  I asked her what she thought it was, and she had no idea.   About 1 minute after the lights disappeared, a very distant boom could be heard, almost like a sonic boom from miles and miles away, but without any visible signs.  About 5 minutes later, another boom was heard, again without any visual cues to what was going on, and then nothing more happened the rest of the night.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615
Several bright lights in a row over Knoxville, TN;2006-11-28 22:45:00;12 seconds;Several bright lights in a row over Knoxville, TN Possible UFO sighting in Knoxville, TN  It was seen approximately 22:45 on Tuesday November 28, 2006.  My wife and I were taking a walk in the World’s Fair Park in downtown Knoxville.  I looked up and noticed several (about 8 or 10 all in a row) bluish-green lights, circular in shape and very bright, just over the clouds.  I thought they were fireworks or a bomb at first but the lights never faded.  They were 1,000 to 2,000 feet high in a partly-cloudy sky.  I saw them for about 12 seconds.  The light in front was the largest.  It appeared the size of a half-moon the lights following behind it were just a bit smaller.  The lights were almost directly above us. They started in the west and were headed east to south-east at about 60-100 mph.  It was an amazing spectacle and very pretty.   After it had passed, I noticed one of the TN Air National Guard refueling planes following behind.  I noticed the plane about 30 seconds after the UFO's.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615

White lights over Knoxville TN;2008-09-06 23:30:00;10 min.;White lights over Knoxville TN It was around 11:30 pm.   My husband was outside on our front porch when he saw them.  He came in and got me to come out and look.  There were white lights that would just appear and look like stars off in the distance in the sky.  They would sit still for a second and then zig zag around and disappear.  Sometimes it was one at a time and sometimes there were 2 at a time.  Once it started out as one light and when it took off, it separated in to 2 separate lights.  They don’t leave any kind of trail behind them.  They don’t make straight lines either.  They either zig zig or circle around. My husband has seen them once before, but I don’t remember the date or time.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615
Orangish, white stars or planets in Orion's Belt, then moved and flew off;2008-09-28 20:30:00;2 minutes;Orangish, white stars or planets in Orion's Belt, then moved and flew off Orangish, white light. Like a star or planet. But, brightest light in sky. Just after dusk eastern time USA. 9/22/08. No blinking lights. Apparently not an aircraft. Not moving in straight line nor had speed as a sun-reflected orbiting craft would have looked like. Length of viewing: 30 seconds. In east, northeastern sky. In Orion’s Belt halfway in gap between lower two stars and top star. Then moved down and to the left (a 3-10 degrees), hovered, and moved away until light faded away. Then, a few days later., I saw the same thing in the same place. In Orion’s Belt halfway in gap between lower two stars and top star. Only this time it was two star-sized lights. Stayed precisely same distance from each other as they moved down, to the left, and faded away (appeared to be moving away from me). Length of viewing: 2 minutes. Noticed low-flying aircraft in that direction (a couple of small private planes) and maybe a commercial jetliner flight), but slower than the objects and didn't seem to be associated with the lights. Looked at a NASA website to see if ISS or other orbiting craft were above my location, but didn’t come up with anything.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615
Five white lights int he sky, like stars or planets, move around one another and then move quickly over the tree line and out of sight.;2009-03-19 01:20:00;3 minutes;Five white lights int he sky, like stars or planets, move around one another and then move quickly over the tree line and out of sight. I was walking to my car and noticed the sky was packed with visible stars. It was something that is not a common sight in the city.  As I was taking in the sky I noticed, what looked like, 5 stars that were brighter than the others. They looked to be as bright as planets in the sky. I don't know much about astronomy but I do know that there aren't that many planets to be seen that well, not to mention these stars were very close to one another.   After a couple minutes of trying to figure out what they could be they began to move.  They had been fixed in the sky and now were moving towards one another.  They were in very close proximity and moving all around each other.  The best way to describe them is to compare them to gnats or moths flying around a light source only a lot slower.  When they first started moving I thought maybe they were lights from helicopters but I don't think helicopters fly that close to one another and not in those kinds of patterns.  After 30 seconds or so of being confused by what I was watching they moved, in unison and fairly quickly, over the tree-line and I could no longer see them.  These objects never made a noise that I could hear.  I am generally a skeptic when it comes to UFOs but I am really perplexed by what I saw. I have been searching the web since, trying to find a similar sighting.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615
A string of about  12 amber lights sighted in clear late evening sky moving NNE from the Smoky Mnts.;2010-10-12 22:45:00;4 minutes;A string of about  12 amber lights sighted in clear late evening sky moving NNE from the Smoky Mnts. A string of amber lights appeared to rise from SSE.  I first thought they were aircraft following each other towards TYS air field.  I called my wife and quickly got my binoculars after about 6 bright amber lights appeared in a straight line.  I tried to focus on each individual head lamp to get it into focus but I couldnt get a sharp image of an aircraft head lamp on none of the lights.  They seemed to have gained altitude about 30 miles downrange, rise and get closer to the air field in an unusual single file path. Their were about 12 amber lights.  I checked the objects for aircraft navigation lights, red, green, white flashing lights but there were none.  I commonly see aircraft takeoff and land from my front porch so not seeing navigation lights really alarmed me.  They appeared to fly about 2 miles apart and then they appeared to bank right turn to a visual landing at the field. Once they made the turn they appeared to fade out of sight one by one.  The airfie! ld is 14 miles ESE of my position. The unusual thing was that the lights stayed at the same altitude when they turned, no sighs of desent or loss of altitude.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615

Two bright lights in the sky moving in coordinated efforts, my boyfriend and I witnessed the same event.;2012-09-18 21:00:00;5 - 8 seconds;Two bright lights in the sky moving in coordinated efforts, my boyfriend and I witnessed the same event. I am composing this note for both my boyfriend and I. We were driving home from dinner on Tuesday, September 18, 2012. At approximately 9:00-9:15 p.m. we witnessed an event we have ever seen before. My boyfriend's recollection of the event is a little different than mine. That is why I want to include both of our reports as two different testimonials for the same event. Here is his report: &quotI am typing this report at 10.30 pm est September 18, 2012. My girlfiend and I were driving home from dinner at about 9:00pm est. We live in Knoxville, TN in an area about 20 miles from McGee-Tyson Airport. We are used to seeing airplanes fly over our neighborhood all the time, and this sighting was absolutely not an airplane. It moved too fast in the sky and in a very strange manner. I am not sure what I witnessed was from another world or something the government may be doing, but it was definately something I have never seen before. It was pitch black outside, and just as we were coming over a steep hill on our way home, I witnessed two distinctively bright lights that appeared to be changing colors from orange- to red- to green. They were very bright, brighter and larger than any other star or plane in the sky. What I witnessed lasted from about 5 to 8 seconds, it was very brief. However, I can say there was no avoiding seeing this because it was obvious something was happening that was not normal. The two lights moved higher in the sky in a coordinated effort, then crossed each other. First making arches in the sky, then creating an &quotX&quot path in the sky. The two lights then came together, stopped and held their spots, then took off at opposite directions a speed I have never witnessed. There was also a truck down the road from us that was stopped. We drove towards them, they rolled down their window and told us that they had witnessed the same thing. This was, by far, the strangest thing I have ever seen. The “orbs” (as some people have been referring to them) were in the southeastern night sky.&quot In addition to my boyfriend's report above, I wanted to give my own testimonial for this event: We were coming home from dinner at around 9pm on September 18th. We were coming over a steep hill, and I could see in the sky, much much higher than the tallest trees, two very bright lights. They were circular &quotorbs&quot, I guess some people have been calling them. One was red-ish in color and the other was green-ish. They were very bright, much brighter and larger than any star. And they appeared to have a hazy ring around them. What I witnessed only lasted 1 to 2 seconds, but I know that it was not normal. It was not a star, an airplane, or any other &quotnormal&quot object or light you would expect to see in the night sky. The two lights were moving towards each other, like mirror images. Then they stopped, and separated apart, almost like they were repelled from each other, at a speed I have never witnessed. They moved so fast that you could not keep your eyes on them, then they were simply gone. I did not see the first part where the two lights created arch paths, then &quotX&quoted over each other (as my boyfriend described) because I was looking out the other window, but I did witness the last part of the event, and I can stand with my boyfriend in saying that it was not normal, and something I have never seen before. As soon as this happened, I had a hard time recognizing what happened, I wasn't sure of what I saw, then my boyfriend asked me if I saw it. I immediately knew what he was talking about, and didn't know how to respond. My first response was to call 911 and report it, but we didn't end up doing that. We saw a truck parked down the road of 2 people we have never met. We rolled down our window and they told us they had just witnessed the same event. Basically, I saw one bright red light, or &quotorb&quot, and one bright green light. They were large and moved at a speed I have never witnessed before, in the following pattern: First moving towards each other, in a coordinated effort: --&gt   --&gt   --&gt         O    O         &lt--   &lt--   &lt-- When they met, they stopped and held their position, then separated in opposite directions at a speed I have never seen. Exponentially faster than any other airplane: O   &lt----- &lt----- &lt----- &lt-----       -----&gt -----&gt -----&gt -----&gt   O Then they were simply gone, nowhere to be seen in the sky. Like I said, what I saw only lasted 1 to 2 seconds, but I do not doubt my boyfriend's testimonial at all. I believe that we saw the same thing, and I believe that he did see the lights first create arch paths in the sky, the &quotX&quot over each other. My boyfriend works in sales, and I am a manager at a local company in Knoxville. We make good money. We are not religious, or spiritual, nor are we &quotUFO hunters&quot. We have nothing to hide, and we are not looking to be famous. We have never witnessed anything like this before, and we are honest people who just thought that what we saw needed to be reported. After the event, we researched internet sites to report what we saw, and nuforc.org seemed like the only legitimate website we could find. Thank you.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615

Brilliant Light Shines and Disappears.;2012-11-28 20:00:00;25 seconds;Brilliant Light Shines and Disappears I remember the exact day because it was that of the $500 million lottery drawing.  My girlfriend and I were on the way to purchase a few tickets. We pulled into the local gas station parking lot and through the sun roof a brilliant light was shining, almost floating in our direction. We both saw it and I commented to how it was flying very low.  It was not a plane as we saw planes, indicated by blinking lights, flying in the back ground. After parking, instead of rushing to buy lotto tickets, I was curious and wanted to see if I could hear the motor flying the mysteriously bright light.  I  could hear nothing, and I've been known to have keen ears.   My girlfriend and I were just looking at it when I noticed Venus next to the moon.  I know it was Venus because i used a star map app to find out.  As I focused on Venus, with the app, my girlfriend looked away from the shining object. An instant later the brilliant shining light was gone.  I wanted to put the object in the app but no suck luck. We were also out of luck when it came to winning the lottery.  Maybe next time we'll get a video and the money.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615

Observed a light, rather bright, but not much larger in apparent diameter than a star or planet, that was clearly changing colors, alternating white, then reddish and greenish, yellow/blue, alternatively, but not at all in the blinking fashion of an airplane.   Color changes were much slower, changing color every second or so.  The light was scintillating or pulsing, which could have been caused by the slight wind as well.  It was visible in the North-North-West direction, about 40 degrees above the horizon.   It was moving slightly, slowly, apparently going further in the north direction, and/or lower toward the horizon.  It became hidden behind trees after about 10 minutes of observation.  I called two of sons to observe that with me.   I tried to take pictures/movies with iPhone but the pictures do not show anything.  It could be a distant airplane but I was very surprised by the pace and diversity of changing colors.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615
UFO Fleet of bright green star-like orbs photographed while traveling across downtown Knoxville.;2016-08-19 20:49:00;25 minutes;UFO Fleet of bright green star-like orbs photographed while traveling across downtown Knoxville. I was exiting a restaurant with a friend on Gay Street on 8/19/16 at 8:49 pm in Knoxville TN.  As soon as we stepped out onto the street, I looked North (with my I-Phone 6 in hand) and I was overwhelmed by the sight of a very strange cloud formation.  It had three plumes jetting out of it and there was a ceiling of another cloud above it.  It was so surreal and I said to my friend, “I’ve never seen anything like that before in my life!”   At that moment, I had a strange feeling that gave me a sense of it being “other worldly” and it gave me an odd looming feeling. (It should be noted that I was and still am, completely sober.)  Anyhow, I started taking photos of this strange cloud and realized that I had it set on “square” photo and then I switched it to “regular” photo after a few shots (just to explain the difference in layout).  My friend was ready to go and stroll Gay Street, so I turned around on my heels and hopped in the street (as I often do) to take more photos of Gay Street looking South towards the Tennessee Theatre and the river.  So I snap, snap, snap, etc. and then hop back on the sidewalk and take a couple more shots after that. During my photo blitz, I was more focused on looking through my phone-camera than I was on looking at the sky, so I didn’t pick up the details that I had shot until I got home (about an hour and a half later).  As I flipped through the evening’s shots, I could clearly see something in the sky of one of the shots and when zooming in, I discovered that I had photographed a Fleet of bright green UFO’s!  Of course, I then took a much closer look at the photos before and after this particular shot and discovered that I had tracked this Fleet coming out of the clouds (near a mountain which is lined with radio towers) and seconds later, they were on the opposite side of the sky over the Tennessee River.  In the next to the last shot, you can see two domed lights on top of the mountain (across the river).  NOTE:   There are no lights on top of this mountain and the lights are not seen before or after the incident.  Then in the last shot, you will notice the same two dome lights lifting off into the sky and there is also an orb-type UFO faintly seen in this shot as well. The last shot was taken out of series at 9:14 pm. (I think I just happened to catch them again while they were “taking off”).  None of my photos before or after this series of Gay Street shots, show anything in the sky, nor specs on the lens, etc.  I still have all these photos on my phone and I am happy to show anybody who would like to see the original shots so you can verify the time, date and that I have not retouched these in any way.  I have only emailed them to myself and saved them to my desktop to put a slide show together which I shared on my FaceBook page. I should also mention that I have had Close Encounters (of several kinds) numerous times throughout my life.  However, this is the first time that I have ever managed to take photographs of the visitors.  Not that it means much to those who don’t know me but I’m a very logical person, a respected professional in my industry (fine art painting) and a “normal” 49 year old mother.  I hope these photos help open some minds on the topic. Also to note:  In one of the photos, the glowing green orb heads towards me and is photographed from about 10 feet from me near the sidewalk.  Also, when I zoomed in on these photos, each of the anomalies appear to have a 6 pointed star-like glow and each have a hue of violet/rose colored aura around them.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615

Two stationary bluish white lights appearing as rapidly brightening stars (much brighter than Venus) were noticed at approx 40 degrees elevation while setting up my telescope.  One object was 2-3x brighter than the other.   These lights were separated by about a full moon's diameter( 0.5 degrees) and gradually brightened and then faded from visibility.  Definitely not a satellite or Iridium flare.   I am an avid skywatcher and have never seen anything like this.  The stars were rock steady in the sky.

It seemed to me like they were both moving in a circular pattern at times but it could’ve been my eyes, but thought I would mention it anyways!!;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615

I walked outside to get in my truck about an hour before sunrise when I happened to look up and noticed what looked like several stars in a row spaced out evenly. After a second look I noticed they were moving in a straight line headed southeast. I noticed at least 15-20 craft in a line but there could have been more that were out of sight. They weren’t moving crazy fast but I didn’t hear any sound or see any lights flashing like a normal airplane. It looked exactly like a bunch of satellites in a row going across the sky. They seemed to be fairly high in altitude. This looked like a possible military exercise although that would be strange due to the number of craft and lack of major military base near Knoxville.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615

The red light changed to blue and the object reversed direction back south again at a very high rate of speed.  Approximately 5 minutes later I saw multiple red objects in a cluster moving erratic just above the southern skyline.  After a few seconds the objects disappeared all at once.;35.9483246471226;-84.0008870792615
