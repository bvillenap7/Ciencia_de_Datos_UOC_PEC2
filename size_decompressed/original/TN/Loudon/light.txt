Large Mass of UFO's (lights) fly over Loudon, Tn.;2010-11-14 00:30:00;approximately 15 mins;Large Mass of UFO's (lights) fly over Loudon, Tn. At approximately 12:30 AM Nov. 14, 2010 I was called outside by a friend who was screaming for me to come look.  As I looked up to the sky, I seen tons, of orange/yellow individual lights flying in sync.  They were traveling at what looked like a very slow speed, yet definitely moving.  They kept coming out of the southeast heading in a northwest direction.  They would come in packs/groups at times, and at other times they flew individually in line with one another.  The level they were flying was low, but it was hard to tell how low maybe like a helicopter average level, I'd imagine.  I am about 2 miles east of Interstate-75 (exit 72) and I almost had the impression they were flying in line with I-75 north headed towards Knoxville. I immediately got online and went straight to the news, but couldn't find anything on it. I then ran across this sighting over the Pennsylvania/Delaware area reported in October 2010.  I watched the video and it was EXACTLY the same thing I seemed to be viewing.  It was definitely an eerie feeling watching them move across the sky and not have a clue what you were seeing.  I wish someone could explain this to me because I'm actually worried about it.  Not knowing is an awful feeling.;35.7292;-84.3436000000001
