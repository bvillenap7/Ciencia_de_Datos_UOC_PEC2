Unknown Craft Seen Over Lake;2008-10-09 04:15:00;20 seconds;Unknown Craft Seen Over Lake I have tried to brush off what I saw a little over a week ago. But I really can't rationalize what I saw and feel like I should report it.  I was at my house and I wasn't getting good sleep. I happened to wake up around 4:15 am and moved because the spot I was in was uncomfortable. I moved to a spot next to a big bay window over looking a lake. While laying there before closing my eyes, I noticed a really bright light. I cannot tell how far away it was, it seemed to be a couple of miles, but it was so bright that there was a reflection of its light on the lake. The bright light alone drew my attension to it. The object was not moving which seemed odd. The color was white and red with the white being much brighter than the red. Then, the white light began to dim but the white light was still brighter than the red. This oject then made a slow move to my left and then to the right before stopping. The movement was strange, it moved like a a puck on an air hockey table (and was very agile), I have never seen any type of maned craft move in that way. The object then stopped for about 4 seconds and then made a progressive move in one direction (the speed was not alarmingly fast)moving behind a mountain ridge and I didn't see it again. It wasn't a hellicopter, I would have been able to hear it if were a hellicopter and it wasn't a plane or star.
