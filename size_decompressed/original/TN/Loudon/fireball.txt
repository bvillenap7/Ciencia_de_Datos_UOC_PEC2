A flame like object moving at a good speed in a clear pattern.;2013-09-01 20:30:00;2 minutes;A flame like object moving at a good speed in a clear pattern. My wife and I and brother in-law saw a fireball moving toward us from the South heading North at a speed where we could follow it, it wasn't too fast but it was't slow either.   This went on for about 1 minute to 2 minutes the craft or whatever it was ascended and seemed to go higher into the atmosphere where the yellow flame became less bright and now the yellow turned more to a white and grew smaller and dimmer until it disappeared while heading South East and up and away like it rose up away from us. What struck us was the yellow flame like color and completely silent sound.  There was no engine noise, it was almost like a flare but it had a very clear pathway across the sky.
