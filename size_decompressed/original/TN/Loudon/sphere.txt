Metallic Ball Cluster Daytime;2019-12-04 14:00:00;1 Minute;Metallic Ball Cluster Daytime While driving on the Interstate, I looked into the sky saw 20-30 ball shaped metallic objects. They seemed to be like birds flying in an imperfect formation.  They were reflective. They made no sound. Each individual object moved in a windmill type manner. The objects were spinning and moving forward in the sky. I was able to snap a picture of the event. In the picture, you will see the unidentified objects at the bottom, and there is a strange colored cloud that appeared only in picture. At time of picture it was only blue skies and these objects. I also took another picture of the objects and they did not appear at all in that picture.;35.7292;-84.3436000000001
