I was awakened at 3:00 am with the electricity in my home off.  Then my husband awakened after myself, which is extremely rare as he is a very deep sleeper.  I said to my husband that there must've been a power failure in the night.  At that moment, the entire house shook and vibrated and there was an extremly loud humming sound resonating throughout and all around us.  I looked out my kitchen window and witnessed bright neon green light lighting up the yard encompassing our house.   I was in shock to witness a humanoid figure beside the fence facing me about twenty feet from where I was standing.  I could make the shape what appeared to be a protective helmet over its head I observed a wand in its hand which appeared to be sparking..  I could sense it telepathically trying to compel me to go outside my home but I managed to resist it and ran to get my husband.   The whole incident lasted about 5 minutes or so before the humming stopped, lights dissipated! , and electricity restored.;35.7506;-87.8241
