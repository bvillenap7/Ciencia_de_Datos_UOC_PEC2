As I was watching television last night at about 23:45, I witnessed a bright light seemingly emerge out of the night sky and slowly move behind the tree line out of sight.  I could not have watched this, “craft” move for more that three seconds, but one detail that stuck out to me was how bright and fuchsia the lights were.  I counted four lights in the shape of a rectangle surrounding several other smaller lights, although I did not make out the details of those as well.  Also, the fact that this, “craft” appeared out of nowhere in the night sky indicates that this could not have been any kind of civilian aircraft.;35.5625;-89.6502
