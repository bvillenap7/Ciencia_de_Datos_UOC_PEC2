It was a semi cloudy night, so you could see the moon in between the clouds and for some reason I looked up and I seen an object in the sky.  It was kind of the shape of the flying wing, but it was seethrough, kind of like the predators camoflauge in the movie.  It was flying through the sky at a fast pace and at a low altitude, it made no noise.  My friend and I thought it was kind of weird becuase we had never seen an aircraft like that, considering we were studying to be aircraft mechanic in the Navy and the Marines.  We were studying various aircraft engines and never encounterd an aircraft flying at a low altitude that never made any noise. I had never told my story to anyone, only my family.;35.3158679245283;-89.9034188679245
