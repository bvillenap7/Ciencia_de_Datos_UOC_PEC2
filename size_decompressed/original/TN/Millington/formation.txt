Same star-like formation reported recently by a Ret. Lt. Genl (USAF). This is in response to the Ret. Lt. Genl. (USAF) who reported the same sighting in the fall of 2001, which I saw in the fall of 1979. When I was 8, my older brother and I nightly analyzed the sky for 2.5 weeks as a result of frequently-reported UFO sightings. I saw an inverted-V formation of 8 lights - 4 down on each side, indistinguishable from stars, quickly invert to a V-shape and then, in about 1 second, traverse from the directly-South sky to the directly-West sky. A perfect 45-degree hemisphere shift in 1 second. I was able to point this V-shaped configuration out to others for two nights following my sighting. The Lt. Genl.'s report, which inspired mine, are similar except that the star-like formation he reported was in an inverted-V in the west, shifted to a V-shape, then traversed 45 degrees south, in about 1 second, indistinguishable from the stars. That's 22 years that these monitors have been doing whatever they are doing. And I agree with the Lt. Gen'l. - there is no way this satellite technology. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We moved into an old plantation house in the middle of  a cotton field.I have documented several ORBS on my phone shadows of people  moving through the house, I have caught tons of orbs outside and triangular  formation that looked like 3 separate crafts and they hovered in the same spot and came straight down to eye view of me with a cloudy haze surrounding them, as if to disquise the view of the crafts.  There is also a LG craft that hovers above my house that is high and radiates a bright light that changes colors  it is as if it is trying to blend into the stars.  Whisp of cloudy white smoke often floats by me inside my house it is a uneasy errie  feeling here and outside my animals have tore curtains down they bark at nothing well to the human eye it is nothing radio and lights come on and off and things in my house are moves come up missing then are returned days to weeks later in odd spots;35.3158679245283;-89.9034188679245
