OBJECT in the Hermitage, Tennessee Sky;2005-11-05 11:00:00;don't know;OBJECT in the Hermitage, Tennessee Sky I was on my back deck taking pictures of our trees in the back for the fall colors, 1st year in our new home. I used my Nikon Coolpix 2200 digital camera to take this photo.  I DID NOT see this object when I took the photo. I took several pictures of the trees, this is the only one with this object in it. I honestly do not know what it is. My roommate thinks it something on the lens, my camera lens is very small, I do not think something was on the lens,if so, it did not show up on any other pictures. I was suprised to see this object on the pic. Anyway, you can tell me what it is, if anything? Dust? I am a UFO believer, but don't wanna be a fool.;36.1876;-86.6119
Ball or round object very high about 25000 feet following Passenger jets.;2021-05-16 12:00:00;1 min;Ball or round object very high about 25000 feet following Passenger jets. Two passenger aircraft were flying the same route at different elevations. The one headed over Nashville Airport to the Northwest had a small ball or round object following it, then as the higher aircraft approached the point of crossing the path of the plane headed NW, the ball stopped and went west some small distance off the contrails and waited for the plane headed southeast to pass, then after it had passed what appeared a small distance beyond the round object the round object went back to the contrail and approached the back of the plane headed southeast and followed it very close until it faded in the distance beyond visual site.;36.1876;-86.6119
