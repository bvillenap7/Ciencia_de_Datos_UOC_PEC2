Orange Glowing Light.;2011-02-14 05:00:00;10 minutes;Orange Glowing Light I was walking out to my car, to start it up to melt the mourning frost.  I looked up to the northeast sky and saw a bright orange light hanging perfectly still.  It was very bright and appeared to have a hair like appendage extending from around its bottom, almost melting in appearance, but this could have been an optical illusion.  I was shocked with what I was seeing.  I screamed out for my wife and daughter to come out of the house and they both saw what I saw.   We watched it for a few more minutes and it drifted in a straight line west and blinked out.  I mean it just blinked out. I have seen military flares before, but this did not have any resemblance to them.   We live close to Nashville Airport and airplanes were flying out in the distance.   After it blinked out, my daughter and I started to get into the car to get her to school.  We were getting into the car and I saw the same type of light shoot up from the horizon, in a straight line, and go to the same exa! ct spot as the previous light and start hovering.   I have never been freaked out by anything, but this incident still haunts me to this day.  Some one could have been shooting off military flares, but flares do not hover or go in a straight line from east to west.   I also heard no report.  It was above the tree line, but I could not tell distance or altitude due to the darkness.  I have been struggling with myself whether to report this or not.  Hope this helps someone who may have seen something similar. ((NUFORC Note:  The witness indicates that the date of the sighting in February 2011 is approximate.  PD));36.1876;-86.6119
