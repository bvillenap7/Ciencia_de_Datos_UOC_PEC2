Made no sound V-shaped huge black craft with lights outlining the V-shape.  Black and completely silent.  Seemed about 200 feet above the ground.  It appeared to be trying to blend in with the sky, but I could make out the shape.  I was walking outside at about 2:00 AM when I noticed it following above me.  It was about as big as a house and only a few hundred feet high.  It made no sound whatsoever.  I can still see the image in my mind.  When I noticed it following me, I ran home because I was scared.;35.4265;-88.6413000000001
