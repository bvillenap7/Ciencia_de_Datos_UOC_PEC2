Vertical in sky, about 2000 ft altitude Walked outside to retrieve an item from vehicle.  Noticed three orange red shimmering sphere shaped objects in the western sky about 2000 ft.  These were in a vertical line.  No noise, and were not helicopters, weather balloons etc.  Upon observing the objects, they moved side to side in an almost synchronized pattern.  Realizing what this might be I  Rushed inside to get wife and phone camera, and when returned, the bottom two were gone and the top object was rising into the horizon at an angle to the west, leaving what appeared as a possible trail of light.  This is the object my wife was able to witness.  Never have I given much thought to ufo's etc, but this is something that given the entire event of circumstances, I am not quite sure what I have seen here.  Very Very unfortunately, I was not able to obtain any video.  This is the part that is most frustrating;35.4265;-88.6413000000001
