Streak of light across the sky on Tuesday, November 28 at 18:25 (EST);2006-11-28 18:25:00;5 seconds;Streak of light across the sky on Tuesday, November 28 at 18:25 (EST) I was driving north on Highway 61, about 3 miles south of Oliver Springs when I saw a flash of light (I would call it streaking) moving from the NW toward the E, SE. The flash lasted for 1-2 seconds, then I could see 4-5 balls of fire develop from it. They continued to burn for a second or two and then went dark, one after the other, beginning with the most forward ball.;36.0353;-84.3472
