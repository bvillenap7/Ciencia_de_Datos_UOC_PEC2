I asked if anyone else noticed and my daughter said she saw the same thing. The two objects appeared, they were rectangular in shape not a shape that is easy to descripe but they were very bright in color like a firework which is what I thougt they were except they were to high in the sky for fireworks and fireworks cannot fly that high.  I turned to ask my wife if she saw them when I turned back to the sky they were gone.  At this time my daughter said she had seen the same thing we laughed that what we saw was a UFO but it still remains on my mind that these two bright lights had no start point and no end they were there and gone instantlyand did not seem to fly but just appear and disappear.;35.7897000000001;-84.2255142857142
