I turned to see a triangular very dark in color, probably black, shaped object.  It flew-hovered extremely slow just over the powerlines.  It had two constant lights in the bottom center and flashing lights on its extreme edges. It was massive.  It made NO noise to be heard.  Our first thought was at that speed and altitude that it was on a controlled crash coarse for a field a half mile away.  No crash reported.  We did not know who to tell or what to do.;35.7897000000001;-84.2255142857142
