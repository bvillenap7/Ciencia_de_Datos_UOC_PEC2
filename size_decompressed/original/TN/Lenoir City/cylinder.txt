Two reflective metallic objects spotted hovering over Lenoir City Tennessee.;2015-12-14 16:00:00;1.5 hours;Two reflective metallic objects spotted hovering over Lenoir City Tennessee. Driving North on Hwy 11, at 3:55 pm, I noticed the sun reflecting of of what I thought was a jet.  I noticed the was no vapor trail and the object did not move.  I thought maybe it was a helicopter but again it shined like chrome and did not move.  There was no sign of any rotors as well.   After keeping an eye on it for a few minutes my wife and I also noticed a second object just like the first at the same altitude facing the same direction as the first.  The second craft was east of the first one.   We proceed to Knoville and returned via Interstate 75 south passing the Lenoir City exit and noticed the object still in the same place.  By his time approximately one and a half hours had passed.;35.7897000000001;-84.2255142857142
