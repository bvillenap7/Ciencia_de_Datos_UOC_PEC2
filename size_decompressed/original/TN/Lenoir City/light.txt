2 orbs traveling side by side under dense cloud coverage 4:09 am.;2017-06-21 04:00:00;30 seconds;2 Orbs traveling side by side under dense cloud coverage 4:09 am. Awoke at 4 am.  Went outside to smoke cigarette.  Also looked to see what weather was like.  I noticed the clouds were thick and dense.  There were no stars visible and no aircraft apparent at this time.  I live 15 miles from an airport and do notice  aircraft daily.  There are no trees in my yard and I have large open  neighborhood as well. As I stared out, looking toward South, I noticed light above me.  When I looked up I saw two lights traveling from the North, coming directly over me.  They appeared to be no more than 150ft in the air.  I watched as the traveled.  I could clearly see them below the clouds and were not a part of any aircraft nor attached to object/drone.  I watched for about 7 seconds as they then  turned off.  I felt fear come over me for I was aware there was no other explanation I could fathom for these lights being there..  This was very close and highly visibleâ€¦  This was no mistake for aircraft (NO noise and not consistent in speeds of typical airplane/copter) or stars as clouds were so thick and covering entire sky. I went back into home to retrieve phone and had came  back out.  As I stepped out I could see that one of those orbs or lights was  turned back around and headed back In direct North path it had originally came in from.  The other light was not visible.  The light  visible then also turned off or burned out just as the porch door closed.  I could still see a sort of ember or  outline of the light r but I am not sure it wasn't just my eyes adjusting to what they had just seen.  Morning bird chirping was the only sound.;35.7897000000001;-84.2255142857142
