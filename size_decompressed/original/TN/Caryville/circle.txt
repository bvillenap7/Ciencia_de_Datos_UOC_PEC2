Three lights changing shapes.;2018-10-30 06:40:00;5 minutes;Three lights changing shapes Had walked kids out to bus stop, as we looked toward to mountain top I noticed 3 lights that I haven't seen before.  Within 45 seconds the shape the three crafts make changes from a line then into a triangle and then to a C shape, it would stay in one shape for a certain time before changing.  They lined up once again and one by one disappeared.  I did notice as this was lining up the last time there was an aircraft flying over and another that looked the same 30 seconds later.;36.3047;-84.2068

I quickly realized this was a beam of light coming down from a larger light.  It was so bright you could see the trees that it was lighting up.  The girls got scared so we leave and as we are getting on the intersrate which is between my house and the mountians  i start to look for the light source and as the mountian comes in to view there is a round ship with white lights around it, it's just perfectly hovering there over this section of trees, we look as long as we can until its out of site....my husband and i are going to try to get to the area and check it;36.3047;-84.2068
