No landing lights were displayed.  Flight was observed between the citys of Martin and Sharon parallel with hwy 45 east.  As flight passed our location the lights began to dim and then went out as they passed the SE portion of the sky from our location.  The lights were orange in color or flame colored like a wood fire.  Lights also flickered like a fire.  There was no altitude change observed during the flight.;36.3495;-88.8545000000001
