Blue (same as sky) colored circle with red, white and blue lights on it seen around dusk.;2011-10-12 19:40:00;30 seconds;Blue (same as sky) colored circle with red, white and blue lights on it seen around dusk. I am a 14 year old student in East Tennessee.  I am very reliable and responsible.   This is my story: About 10 minutes ago (7:40 PM EST, 10/12/11), I was in my bedroom.  I heard a helicopter fly overhead (which, oddly enough, airplanes and helicopters have been flying over quite frequently, recently).  I ran outside to see what it was.  When I got to where I could see, the copter was going in an approximately NE direction.  It looked like any other chopper. Then, before I turned to leave, I saw lights flashing in the sky going in an approximately S-SW direction.  The lights were very small, so I figured it was high in the air, because it didn't look that far away by land.  The lights were red, white, and blue, with the white lights showing up more frequently.  They were in a random order, the colored lights never being in the same location.  I could not see a craft of any sort attached to the lights at first.   Then I noticed a circle that the lights were attached to on one end following the lights.  It was the same color of the sky (a dark, almost grey-blue, as it was almost dusk).  It moved steadily across the sky until it left my view.   The whole incident lasted about 30 seconds.;36.2606;-83.1421
