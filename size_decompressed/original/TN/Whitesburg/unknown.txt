Numerous red dots moving South to North.;2013-09-20 22:30:00;10 minutes;Numerous red dots moving South to North As I was coming home from work, I noticed some bright red dots in the sky.  Probably 10 of them at once.  They were moving South to North very slowly and seemed to burn out as they moved North.  They weren't in any type of recognizable formation but their spacing never varied.  There was no noise that I could hear from my location. As the dots moved to the North and disappeared, more would come up form the horizon in the South- usually just one or two at a time.  They also kept their spacing like the previous ones.  I did manage to take some pictures and video footage, but it's hard to see them due to the full moon and ambient lighting from street lights.;36.2606;-83.1421
