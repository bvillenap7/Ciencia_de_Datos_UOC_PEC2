Black object flying with no lights at night;2008-02-03 22:30:00;1 minute;Black object flying with no lights at night I was standing on my porch at approximately 22:30. I see air traffic from the Nashville airport at night all the time, but this object had no lights. It was solid black, and it traveled much slower than any other air traffic. In fact, a jet flew past at the same time the object was in the sky, and the jet had several lights. They had to have been less than a quarter of a mile away from each other. I had time to get my brother from inside to come see it. We both watched it for about 20 seconds. I am an illustrator that is well educated, and I will remember this sighting for the rest of my life.;36.2646;-86.7020000000001
