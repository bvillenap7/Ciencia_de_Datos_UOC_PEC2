At approximately 11:00 am, I looked up at the sky to view the contrail patterns made by several jets flying overhead.  I took a picture and then noticed a light blue sphere that was moving in a zig zag pattern through the contrails from left to right.  At times, it was emitting a purple crescent-shaped haze.  I took several pictures of it and after approximately 15 minutes, it disappeared behind one of the contrails and was no longer seen.;36.2646;-86.7020000000001
