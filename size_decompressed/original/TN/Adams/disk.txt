At 9:40 A.M. on 10/26/01, my wife and I were traveling to Nashville, Tennessee on I 24the sky was completely clear except for the trail of jet streams of two jets we noticed in the sky.  As we were traveling south toward Nashville, I noticed two jets that appeared to be heading toward each other.  One was heading east and one heading west.  Out of bewilderment, we continued to observe the planes.  After watching for approximately two minutes, suddenly, a bright silver appearing disc shaped object (the width of the jet stream itself) appeared between the two planes and swooped into the jet stream of the plane coming from the east and traveled the entire length of that plane's stream in approximately 2-3 seconds and disappeared.  As soon as the object disappeared, both planes verred away from their paths and appeared to go in opposite directions.  Needless to say, in light of the attacks on Washington and the World Trade Center, we assumed the planes were military aircraft zeroing in on something picked up on radar however, as we both observed, what ever the object was, it was certainly too fast for our jets to intercept.;36.5543;-87.1227
