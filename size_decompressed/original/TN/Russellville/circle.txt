Roughly 1/3 mile away from me. Was hovering over houses about 700-900ft, about 1/3 mile away from me, brighter than any aircraft light, or star, it made no noise.  Around where i live, you can here a plane or helicopere coming from a mile or 2 away.   It did not start to move until i pulled a spotting scope out and started looking at it, then it went to the right and disappeared in about 3 seconds.;36.2568;-83.1882
