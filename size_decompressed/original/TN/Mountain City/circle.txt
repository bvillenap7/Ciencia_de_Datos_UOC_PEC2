Solid lights without noise traveling at different altitudes in the night sky.;2015-06-02 21:00:00;5 minutes (each);Solid lights without noise traveling at different altitudes in the night sky. We saw at least 8 different solid white lights moving across the night sky.  2 of them were as low as a small plane, but with no noise at all.   The others were way up in the sky but again solid white lights without noise (not like a jet) and jets can't fly at those altitudes.   We have been seeing these lights with increasing frequency for the last month.  The difference with last night is they are now flying lower in the night sky than before last night.   What are they?  And do we have to worry?;36.4631;-81.8171
