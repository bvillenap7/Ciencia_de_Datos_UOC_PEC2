Any info appreciated please.;2014-12-07 20:15:00;5 minutes;any info appreciated please On the night of 12/7, as I was leaving work, I saw a light that I initially thought was a plane moving north from a southwesterly direction.  My daughter was also standing on the porch with me, and we had watched several planes in the few minutes we were outside.   I called her attention to the light being a single clear light with none of the normal aircraft lights.  The light then turned from its seeming northward trajectory and began moving quickly away to the east.  It only remained visible for another 3-4 seconds however before being gone.   There were other planes clearly visible in the same area including one that came from the exact easterly direction immediately after the light had gone, however that plane suddenly turned back and went back to the east again, a highly unusual thing for aircraft that we normally witness in the skies above NE Tn.   I would really like to just know if you have any information from that night of the military chasing an object in this area please, as I have been perplexed since that night.  Any information would be so greatly appreciated.  Thanks much;36.4631;-81.8171
