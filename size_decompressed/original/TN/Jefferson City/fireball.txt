I counted 26 and everyone else counted between 25&30.  They was quiet, liveng in a quiet town and neighborhood, planes can be heard easily.  They had no sound, they was flying in sequence & came in the numbers. I swear I'm not lying.  They came so close to our apartment complex that I was scared of an aerial attack from another country...  But they wasn't planes.  I seen them up close and it wasn't like anything I've seen before...  I have a crappy video. (Night time) this has occurred three times now.  I always get a funny feeling and it's bad.  goalies lights flickered and four peoples nose started bleeding.  Mine included;36.1163;-83.4809999999998
