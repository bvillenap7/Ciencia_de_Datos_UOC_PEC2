Strange Object Passes over House;2005-09-01 18:25:00;25 Seconds??;Strange Object Passes over House I was standing in my backyard, watering some plants. I happened to look up at the sky and noticed a small white dot flying in a southwesterly direction toward the city of Knoxville, which is a larger city in East Tennessee. It made no noise however, there was an aircraft just south of the object. The identifiable craft was a commercial airliner. I have experience in aviation, and this dot did not have wings that could be seen. Aircraft pass over all the time however, you can always see their wings and they frequently leave contrails across the sky. This was a UFO, although I doubt that it was extraterrestrial. Maybe a secret military plane? Who knows? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.
