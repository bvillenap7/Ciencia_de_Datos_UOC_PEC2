Lights flashing and hazy trail left behind when moving upward. Round object with around 4-5 lights around it.  The lights flashed and weren't all the same color.  Some of them had a blueish looking tint to it and some looked like normal light bulb colored.  Was going upwards slowly and leaving a trail of haze or smoke.  After it moved upward it started going straight like a helicopter would and started gaining speed.  Eventually was moving pretty fast through the sky until we could no longer see it.  We freaked out and watched it to make sure it was not a helicopter or airplane.  There's no way it could have been anything but a ufo or advanced government machinery, etc.  it wasn't imagined we both seen it and asked each other if we seen it too.;36.5687;-85.1459
