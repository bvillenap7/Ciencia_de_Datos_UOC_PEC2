As we were gazing at the moon and stars from our hottub, we both noticed simultaneously,2 bright objects in the sky, NE, about 45 degrees. About a fist apart if you held your fist up to them. The object on the lower left, faded first,then the top one began to fade, and then they were gone. We knew they were not satellites, as we had just checked a few minutes before for those that were going over. They were like bright stars, as bright as Venus.;36.2465;-83.5114
