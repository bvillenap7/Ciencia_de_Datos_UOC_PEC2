Amber orb witnessed adjacent to huge beam of light spanning the night sky.;2017-06-11 22:56:00;1 hour;Amber orb witnessed adjacent to huge beam of light spanning the night sky I recorded an orb of amber light in the sky while night fishing on Cherokee Lake.  The video is not too fascinating, just seeing a ball in the sky.  I took a picture of the orb and it looked like an amber ball until I zoomed in.  It looks like a disc-shaped object with a domed top.   This sighting was occurring for about an hour simultaneously with the beam sighting, reported separately.   The UFO picture was taken 12 minutes after I noticed the beam in the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Same witness as the one for a report from Rutledge, TN, 12 minutes earlier.  PD));36.2465;-83.5114
