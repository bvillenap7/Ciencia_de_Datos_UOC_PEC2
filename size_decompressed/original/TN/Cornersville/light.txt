Green orb of light descending vertically at high rate of speed;2013-02-14 22:45:00;10 seconds;Green orb of light descending vertically at high rate of speed As I was driving southbound on I-65 near Cornersville, TN, I noticed a green spherical shaped light descending from the sky at a high rate of speed.  I initially thought it was a light from an aircraft but the descent speed was much too quick.  I then thought it was a plane in distress and expected to see it crash.  When the light got a few hundred feet above the treeline it simply disappeared.  It was still way above the horizon and I was travelling towards it so there is no way I could have lost sight of it.;35.3442;-86.8314
