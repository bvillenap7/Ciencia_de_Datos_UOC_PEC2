The object was round not oval, I don't think, I was kinda looking at it sideways, but I'm pretty sure it was round. It was flying low and flew over Coleman RD where I live, it wasn't fast it was slow. There was only one but it was pretty big and it was like a giant, white, round light. When I saw it I was young around 3 or 4 but I remember it clearly and right now I'm 12. There were three people who saw it besides me. My Great Grandfather and two neighbors, both from different houses. We were on the hill, which is the terrain on Coleman Rd. I was in my house at first then my Great Grandfather told me to look out the storm door. I did and saw a bright, white, round light flying low and comming towards our hill. We went outside the same time our neighboors did and watched it till it slowly disappeared behind the other hill. I didn't know what U.F.O.s were untill I saw it and it was like then I knew what it was. I don't know what month it was or year, or at what time it happened. But I beleive it was in between 19:00 and 21:00, or 7:00 to 9:00 P.M. central and pacific time. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));35.3442;-86.8314
