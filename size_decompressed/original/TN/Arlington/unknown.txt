Spotlight shines over Arlington.;2014-09-23 20:27:00;3 seconds;Spotlight shines over Arlington. 9/23/2014 at 8:27 (looked at the clock) I was sitting in the driveway facing an eastward direction, I leaned forward and noticed a light kinda like a spotlight shining around in the sky.  Then the light, which was a blue-ish color, shined directly in my direction for split second, then swung upwards and went black.  I opened the door got out to look and nothing, gone, no sounds or anything.   Ok, I know it was NOT a helicopter, they don't normally climb to commercial jet altitude, which is about where this was, say about 30-35,000 feet.  It wasn't a reflection off the windshield, I tried to recreate it just in case and couldn't.  It wasn't a commercial jet, I see those all the time, it wasn't a satellite, I see them too.  I cant explain what that was.  I tried to scan the area afterwards to see if I could detect any movement without lights but I didn't see anything.;35.2752;-89.7295
