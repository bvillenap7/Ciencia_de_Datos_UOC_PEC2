6 round orange lights seen in southwestern sky in west Tennessee;2015-11-14 19:00:00;20 seconds;6 round orange lights seen in southwestern sky in west Tennessee I observed 6 round orange lights in the southwestern sky this evening around 7 p.m.  I had taken my dog out in the back yard and looked up to see the lights which were in the approximate shape of a check mark.  Two lights at the bottom were very close together and the rest of the lights appeared to form an arc toward the west..these were farther apart.  I ran inside to get my camera and when I came back out, all were gone but one.  It seemed to just fizzle out and totally disappear really fast.  Then I observed another orange round light a little farther out.  I was actually able to photograph both of the single sightings before each disappeared.  They did not appear to move through the night sky.;35.2752;-89.7295
