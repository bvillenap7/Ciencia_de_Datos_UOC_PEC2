When we first saw them they were in a straight line.   As they moved, they scattered apart and one was left pretty far away from the others.  They were pretty low, but made no noise at all.  They never stopped moving and they soon were to far away to see anymore.   Later that day, at about 10:00pm, we counted 9 airplanes in the area.;35.1431887283236;-84.8512446531771
