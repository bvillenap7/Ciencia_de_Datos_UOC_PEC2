Thinking we had possibly missed it but, still sat on the back deck a few more minutes.   Then we saw something pass over that was flying lower and faster than the ISS and was much brighter, faster & looked to be much lower.  There were no blinking lights or other colors.  I know what the differences are between difference (looking) meteors.  I've seen many however, nothing that looked like this or as bright.   I waited to post this, to see the real ISS pass over (which states that it will pass over and be seen within a 2 minute time span.   About a week later, our notifications of times/dates for the next fly over.  We definitely saw it (the ISS) & what we saw less than a week earlier was definitely not the ISS!   This object was flying S/SW to N/NE and no sound.;35.1431887283236;-84.8512446531771

I stepped from my vehicle and snapped a picture to send to my Daughter (She collects cloud pix) and totally unaware of the UFO image accidentally caught on camera until that evening. After close inspection and to my amazement, I determined that there is a rapidly moving blue sphere flying through the opening in the clouds.  *See I-Phone 6s picture  Thank you!;35.1431887283236;-84.8512446531771
