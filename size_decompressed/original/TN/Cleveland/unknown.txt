Sporadic movement from light, with cross glare.;2004-12-13 06:00:00;15 Minutes;Sporadic movement from light, with cross glare. I looked out the window from my bed and saw several stars. I noticed one in particular. It moved sporadically, slightly left/right and up/down. I got a pair of binoculars. The light was too far away, probably over Cahutta or Dalton, GA which is SW of my property. I woke up my husband who probably said it was a plane, since we have a busy flight path overhead. Since I had been watching it for over 10 minutes, with no evident travel distance, I insisted he look through the binoculars. No daylight yet, so sky was black. No noise and no discernable shape of unit itself. There appeared to be blue, green and white lights most visible on the lower left side. Through the binoculars, the stars were still just white dots, this object was glared and looked like a cross shape. At one point it appeared to be lighting an area underneath it. Twice, from a considerable distance to the North and to the South of it, there appeared to be shooting stars. But they were shooting upward instaed of down. Tonight my husband informs me the news said we are having meteor showers after 11:00 pm. So did I see a prelude?;35.1431887283236;-84.8512446531771
