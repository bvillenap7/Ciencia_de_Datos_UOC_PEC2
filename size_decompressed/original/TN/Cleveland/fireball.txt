Early morning 4/29 while waiting at a traffic light in north Cleveland, Tennessee, I saw a long, bright and silvery object, maybe a fireball in the sky moving from east to west.  I heard no sound so I didn't believe it to be a jet.  It was very large and moving fast.  The entire event lasted only seconds, maybe 10.   When I exited my car, I heard nothing and saw nothing else.  A co-worker of mine also saw the same thing in Hixson, Tennessee, at about the same time.;35.1431887283236;-84.8512446531771
