Cigar-shaped craft in front of moon.;2010-10-25 20:00:00;45 minutes;Cigar-shaped craft in front of moon. I initially spotted the craft when walking outside my apartment.  There were several people gathered and looking at it.  It was a bright light situated in front of the dark part of a crescent moon.   It seemed to be getting closer, so I decided to run to the store and purchase binoculars.   Viewing it through binoculars clearly showed two white lights and a dim cigar-shaped outline, which was corroborated by several bystanders both at the apartment and the parking lot of the store.  After about 35-40 minutes, the object moved quickly out of the shadowed part of the moon and vanished.;35.1431887283236;-84.8512446531771
