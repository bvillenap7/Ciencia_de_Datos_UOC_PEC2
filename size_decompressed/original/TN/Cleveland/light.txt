Rhythmically moving point of light slowly crossing the northern sky near Chattanooga;2012-06-05 23:40:00;5 minutes;Rhythmically moving point of light slowly crossing the northern sky near Chattanooga At around 11:40 I wandered outside to smoke a cigarette with my father and happened to notice what appeared to be an out of place star in the northern sky.  We've been doing quite a bit of telescope skywatching lately and generally know the night sky quite well so we were intrigued. We continued to observe it and noticed that it was moving west to east in a strangely rhythmic manner.  It slowed down and sped up, repeating this every 2-3 seconds until it was finally out of sight around 5 minutes later.;35.1431887283236;-84.8512446531771
Round White Star Sized Light Slowly Moving After Being a Fixed Object.  Slowly Vanished.;2012-08-17 22:00:00;3 minutes;Round White Star Sized Light Slowly Moving After Being a Fixed Object.  Slowly Vanished. 35Yr. Old Male, Father, Husband.  Outside smoking a cig on my front porch.  Just started doing this 2 months ago when we got news were pregnant again (our 2nd).  I've been using this time to stare at the stars and honestly bask in what I see as God's beautiful creation.  I'm a life long Christian that doesn't rule out UFO's/Aliens b/c I find comfort in knowing mankind truly doesn't have all the knowledge of our Lords magnitude.  No drugs, No boose, just cigs.  I noticed multiple (3) airplanes flying overhead that night as per the norm during the first cig, and saying thank you Jesus as I looked from star to star giving Him the glory.  Sets my soul at ease anywho.....  While doing this for one set of stars (3*) above my neighbors house (NE) for a couple of minutes or 1/2 cigarette. Spending about 1 minute thank the Lord for each one. When I got to the 3rd star and did the same.  Just a few seconds later I then noticed it, the &quotstar&quot (round) start to slowly move north.  Separating itself from the other 2 apparently out of nowhere, meaning it was fixed in the sky while looking at the other two.  It was equal to size, color, and intensity as the other two stars that stayed put.  After about 2 minutes of it slowly moving I noticed it began to become darker, as if the power was cut in half to the light (absolutely no flashing, no color other than white, no flickering).  Then the last minute it maintained the same speed and simply disappeared.  No clouds in the sky.  No ridge line to block view.  The thought to be star for 3 minutes before movement simply disappeared 3 total minutes later. It wasn't a shooting star.  I have seen plenty of those in my lifetime, nor a airplane.  They are starkly different of course to my description.  This makes just the second time in my life I've ever had such an experience.  I was 7 years old when something similar to this happened to me before but it was during the day.  Although I did see the &quotcigar shaped&quot slow flying object reported here locally about 2 weeks ago as well I was told it was a chinese satellite re-entering the orbit by a classmate and wrote it off.  I'm not a conspiracy theorist that's scared of stuff I don't understand.  Just wanted to share this with someone other than my wife.  Take care guys-gals and God Bless.;35.1431887283236;-84.8512446531771
White flashing lights pulsing around the sky and Red flashing crafts also SE Tennessee;2015-11-12 20:00:00;2 hours;White flashing lights pulsing around the sky and Red flashing crafts also SE Tennessee. Flashing white strobe lights and red flashing strobes moving all over the Southeast sky, I live near the Georgia line in Cleveland, TN.  This was last night 11-12-2015, and tonight they are flying 4 in a straight line all at steady speed, so much air traffic also.  I always have a eye to this sky and i have never saw so many planes and I have never saw these white strobe lights flashing like lighting bugs.  And the red ones are moving the same speed as the white ones, one white strobe moved right over this cattle field and another was more south flying low but others are farther out in the sky.  I'm just curious as to what they are.  If you look southeast for a few minutes you will see them flashing.;35.1431887283236;-84.8512446531771
I saw lights at first believed to be a plane, but did not move in the sky at all, just flickered.  ((NUFORC Note:  Star?

We saw what I thought were the lights of a plane at first, but they didn't move from the sky.  Could see it from several places in town.  Flickering lights in sequence like it was a plane, but did not move. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the witness may have been looking at a celestial body, either a star, or a planet?

30+ lights in a line.;2021-05-05 22:35:00;10 minutes;30+ lights in a line. I have night vision, watching the sky.  But these were also visible by the naked eye. There were four of us who saw them. Even without the night vision. Other aircraft we saw had blinking lights. These were solid lights. Traveling in a line. No blinking as aircraft do. Traveling eastward. Nearly uniform in spacing. Seemed to appear and travel Eastward.;35.1431887283236;-84.8512446531771
