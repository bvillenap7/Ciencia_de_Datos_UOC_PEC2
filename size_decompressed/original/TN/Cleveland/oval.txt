A friend and I were sitting on the roof of a building star gazing, looking for shooting stars.  At twelve thirty, around half an hour later, an oval object with a red tint passed directly over us heading east, and disappeared after about five seconds, when nearing the horizon.   Near five minutes later, it came again, this time moving in a straight line to the west, from the direction it disappeared in previously, and went out of sight behind a tree.  Fifteen minutes later, it appeared again, heading south in a straight line.  After we had seen it for about three seconds, it began to zig-zag up and down, and as soon as it headed straight, it completely disappeared.   Before the first occurrence with the object, we had seen about three shooting stars, the last being two minutes before the object appeared.  There were also planes in the sky a few minutes before, but it seemed to be at a much higher altitude than them, possibly in or near the atmosphere.;35.1431887283236;-84.8512446531771
