they keep coing;2005-07-01 19:00:00;they keep coimng;they keep coing I was watching my daughter & her friend riding her 4-wheeler up & down the street we live on.It was just before sunset & something caught my eye in the sky when they were riding up the street up hill,first it looked like a cigar shape but it was bright like a star at nite than it went up on it's side & the sun reflected off it & I seen it was a dull stainless steel color disk . I was so shocked I couldn't believe what I'd seen than it changed back to a cigar shape & flew faster than any thing I'd ever seen in my life,it flew over the lot beside our house & there came another one from the opposite direction came to a stop changed into a round tennis ball shape circled each other than took off so fast & disappeared in a flash this happened in late July or early Aug. of 2005.I told my family & they said,sure you did, When I seen they really didn't believe me I didn't tell anyone else because I figured they would think I was nuts.I don't care who believes me I know what I seen & I know we are not the only ones around.I seen a totally different type of spaceship last year during the Tenn. Walking House Celebration in Shelbyville,Tn.2006 There were 4 of us in the car going to the Horse show coming in from M'BORO,about 1/4 mile from the main street in Shelbyville & I was driving,I noticed something lit up to my left in the sky not very high up,I first thought it was a Goodyear blimp,until we got closer to it I seen it was'nt & it was lit up inside, I got excited & pulled the car over to the side of the road so I could see better, this thing was about 2 stories tall & Hugh & just still in mid air not moving & I thought maybe it was something related to the TN.Walking House event ,Than all of a Sutton it started moving slow & I could see under it and it was in the shape of a triangle with bluish lights only 3, one at each corner under it,than it took off like lighting , this really surprised me something this Hugh traveling at that speed,first not moving than slowly moving but not for very long t! han zoom gone out of sight.I've never seen anything like this before nor since.I've been watching the sky since my first sighting in 2005.I stay up all nite some nites if there's activity.I have taken pictures of some-things I have no idea what they are, maybe you guy can.thanks(contact email-((e-address deleted));35.816;-86.0486
