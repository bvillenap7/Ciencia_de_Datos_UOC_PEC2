It appeared to be in our atmosphere parallel in direction from the ground.   Size of the light was a lot larger then a star, it's hard to describe the size of anything.  If you placed a tennis ball 15' in the air it was around the same size as that would be in relation to it being high in altitude, much larger then a star.   It had no curve in its path with a direction of mostly South, if anything it was south-southwest. Law Enforcement;35.2923;-86.6468
