Out of nowhere something flew straight over my head. I watched it until it disappeared behind some trees. It seemed like it might have been gradually falling(landing?).It was cigar shaped (or as I described it, like a tampon)and it was glowing white like a star. It also had at the bottom a tiny green light. It was going somewhat fast, but not fast enough because it seemed like I watched it forever. It seemed as if it had been catapulted through the air sorta. I did not hear any noise. I knew there was no way it was a plane, and my first thought was that maybe it was a bomb. I literally sat there waiting to hear some time of explosion. When I realized that I was not in any immediate danger, I quickly ran up the driveway, shaking, to ask my sister if she had seen it. Of course, she had not. I began to think of what it possibly could have been, avoiding the assumption that it was an alien spacecraft. I thought maybe it was a meteor, but what I saw was definitely mechanical. I also know a friend that lived in my city when he was around six and remembers seeing balls of light dancing in the sky.;35.0859898305085;-89.7848745762711
