Observed very distant silver object in sunlit western sky just after sundown. It was traveling from my left to right, in a northerly direction at a speed similar to that of airliners transiting that area. Obtained photo with digital camera which was located within reach. Object was visible for about four seconds. The sky photo shows the image clearly, but quite small. Image expanded 200 percent shows a silver colored cylindrical object with bulbous ends. A faint area of atmospheric disturbance appears below it. A small emission or moisture trail appears from the left hand end of it, which would be the trailing end as it moved. It was very near a cumulous cloud when photographed at an altitude of approximately 8 thousand feet.;35.0859898305085;-89.7848745762711
