Multicolored lights flashing in the eastern sky;2014-10-01 03:45:00;30 minutes;Multicolored lights flashing in the eastern sky At approximately3:30 AM flashing lights caught my attention.  At closer attention at a closer look at these lights appeared to be multicolored and in a stationary position appeared to be multicolored. The object was not moving and seem to be very high in the sky.not sure of what I was saying asked three friends to come and look with me and they confirmed the flashing lights.  They then brought to the attention that the object wasmoving. It seemed to randomly movebut not great distances. The object did not appear to be a helicopter or airplane as it was stationary most of the time that we saw it. We then moved to the front of the house to get a more clear view. It appeared the lights were rotating in a counterclockwise rotation around the object. We watch this object for approximately 35 minutes. It did not appear to move when we change locationat the house and my friends went back inside when we were not able to identify what it was.;35.7871;-83.9778000000001
