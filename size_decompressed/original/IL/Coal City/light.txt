((Spacelink satellites??));2019-12-22 18:49:00;5 minutes;Clear night, observed 7-10 lights in a vertical row in sky.  Appeared like star constellation,  WSW, on NW edge of Coal City while walking dog.  Hmmm, never seen that one before.. Lights appeared to be moving, perfectly aligned. Moving swiftly, vertical into sky & disappeared, one at a time,at same location. 3 small aircraft seen well below 'disappearing sight' buzzing around, perhaps noticed them, too. One final light lagged behind, sped up & 'disappeared' at same spot.;41.2946;-88.2866
