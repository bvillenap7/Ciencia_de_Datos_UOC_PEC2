UFO hides from airplane radar.;2012-03-23 22:00:00;1hour;UFO hides from airplane radar. My boyfriend and I saw a strange light in the sky to the west. We knew it was too low to the ground to be a star or satellite.  So we stop the car in the parking lot to observe it.  The light would move up and down, side to side but not quickly. More like in a scanning motion.  Then to our surprise we seen an airplane approaching the UFO.  Then the UFO dropped close to the ground at a high rate of doped then shut off its lights, went totally black.  We could no longer see the UFO. A few minutes later the lights came back on once the airplane was out of site.  Only to move back to its original position and shut off its lights again.  We no longer seen the craft after that.;39.9379;-88.8056
