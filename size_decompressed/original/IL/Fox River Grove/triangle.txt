3 large lights in a large triangle pattern;2009-04-24 10:30:00;3 minutes;3 large lights in a large triangle pattern I was driving home and I saw some big lights out of the corner of my eye so I decided to drive up a large hill to get a better look. I got to the top of the hill to see 3 large lights hovering very low above a farm in a large triangular pattern.  The object was moving at a fast speed but I still was able to follow it for about 3 minutes.  It was flying broad end first, rather than the point.  And it appeared to be flying at an angle.  After following it I turned and it had passed just over some trees and out of sight.;42.1912;-88.2201
