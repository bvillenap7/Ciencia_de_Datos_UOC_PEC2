White strobe, single flash very fast, horizontal/vertical movement covering miles in 1 second.;2014-05-20 22:40:00;5 second;White strobe, single flash very fast, horizontal/vertical movement covering miles in 1 second. Observed May 20th, 2014 approximately 10:40pm  West of Atlanta IL. My daughter and I were sitting on the front porch when I observed a white bright strobe in the sky. The bright light only flashed one time similar to a camera flash. I saw a total of five flashes that placed the source literally miles away from each flash that was approximately one second apart from one another. The first flash appeared as if the source was 20 plus thousand feet in the sky and to my south west. The second flash was same approximately 20 plus thousand feet however to the north west of the sky, literally miles away from the first flash. The third flash was even higher than the first two, and was directly above where the second flash was located however thousands of feet higher as if it shot straight up. The fourth flash was directly beneath the third flash as if it had fallen straight down and appeared to be lower than all the other flashes. I could see that it literally shot back to the south with the last flash being literally miles away in one second. My daughter and I have no idea what we witnessed. I am 51 years old and skeptic to UFO’s, however I know what I saw.  There is no way that this was anything like we have on earth. This was not a jet, I see jets all of the time flying over….this was covering miles in one second bursts. There were no green or red lights. Strictly one white flash placing it miles apart from each flash.;40.2559;-89.2268
