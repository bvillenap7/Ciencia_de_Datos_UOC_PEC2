Not a firework, never came up from the ground. Standing in my backyard watching the fireworks display to the southeast,  I was distracted by abright flash, when I looked high to the direct south a bright light pulsed from the cloud cover above. As I observed it brieflyI could clearly see that it had a very brightblue center with a bright green aura anda medium length tail.  It was descending at astraight 45 degree angle with no decrease in speed or no loss in trajectory, it stayed true to its descent until I lost sight of it.   It disappeared behind the horizon line with no flash signs of impact.;40.7737;-89.9288
