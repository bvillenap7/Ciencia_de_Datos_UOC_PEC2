The only reason I decided to report this sighting is that someone else reported seeing the same thing on the same date.  I havn't said anything to anybody about this because I didn't think anyone would take me serious.  To the person who reported the sighting on the same date in knoxville, IL...I agree, it couldn't have been a shooting star.  I was sitting on my front porch, waiting for my wife to get home from work.  The sky was clear and there were quite a few planes flying around the area.  I was watching the sky as I always do at night, when I saw a very bright blue light to the south of town.  It was falling from the sky at a very slow speed.  It had a tail behind it made up of different colors.  I have never seen anything like it before or since then.  I felt very disturbed by this, uncomfortable.  It may have lasted longer than what I saw because I watched it disappear behind the building across the streat from my house.  The sighting in knoxville the same night was in a different location but the same discription.  I found this website and started reading sightings in Illinois and when I came across the report from knoxville couldn't believe it.  Anyway, I hope this reaches the person who reported the other sighting so that they don't have to feel alone, I know I did until now. ((NUFORC Note:  Source elects to remain anonymous.
