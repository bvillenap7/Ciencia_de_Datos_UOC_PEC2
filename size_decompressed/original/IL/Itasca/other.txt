Thimble-shaped orange-white object observed sitting in traffic;2007-05-17 16:30:00;1 minute;Thimble-shaped orange-white object observed sitting in traffic Around 4:30 PM on May 17, 2007, I had just left work, and after not driving more than about a block from my office (on Rohlwing Road in Itasca) was sitting in backed up traffic due to a train. I happened to look in the driver’s side mirror, at the traffic backing up behind me, and noticed something in the distance in the sky. At first I thought it was an airplane or helicopter, as the area isn’t far from O’Hare Airport, but I noticed that it had a sort of orangish-white glow to it, and as it very slowly horizontally moved along across the clear blue sky, I could see it had a shape that reminded me of a thimble. The size of it was from where I was sitting in my car about the size of my pinky-finger nail from about an arm and a half-length’s away. When the traffic began moving again, I pulled forward a few feet in my car, and when I looked again, couldn’t see the object again. The whole experience was no more than a minute or so long.;41.9705;-88.0193
