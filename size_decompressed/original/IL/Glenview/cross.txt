20+ drones, same make and model, night flying in a staggered loop with no definite point of origin. ((Spacelink satellites));2020-03-07 19:00:00;1 hour;20+ drones, same make and model, night flying in a staggered loop with no definite point of origin. These were obviously drones. From what I could make out, they seemed to be Phantom but I’m not sure about the model. They were all unevenly separated but heading in the same direction somewhat staggered. They were very silent and quite stable considering that there was a decent wind. I have never seen anything like this before, and the fact that they’re all the exact same make and model of drone, and doing VERY similar flight patterns was quite unsettling. Not to mention that their flight path took them in a loop that was at least a mile in diameter. From my experience, the only reason you’d fly your drone out that far would be if you could see/film it— something that you could to do with how dark it was. Don’t worry, I made sure to film it.;42.0786076923077;-87.8207923076922
