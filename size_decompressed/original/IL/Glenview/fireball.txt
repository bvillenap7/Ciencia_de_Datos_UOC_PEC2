My son who is 9 years old pointed the sky and told me to look at the sky.   Then he asked :Mom, look, what is that?  First I thought it is a hot air  balloon, later I saw a fire inside of it.  It was red and orange color and it was circling around.  After 3 min it disappeared among the trees.  I took a picture of it but it is not very clear.;42.0786076923077;-87.8207923076922
Fireball at first, now i just see a glowing light which keeps blinking.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Sirius??

I saw a fire ball, it looked as though the very end of a firework where it sizzles off and dissapears. Then i ran downstairs because i freaked out. I thought it was right in the tree in my backyard. I went downstairs and told my father, we have now been looking at a glowing light which keeps getting dimmer and brighter and blinking for about 20 minutes. The dot is not moving, i have sat in the same spot and just waited to see if perhaps it would move. All i see is a glowing object in the sky... it just keeps glowing. It is clearly far away. It looks different than the stars... clearly, because they arent moving and this one is blinking. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

I had just looked up out the window, which faces east when I saw the glowing object fall in a slight arc to the earth and it seemed to have a white, or silvery color part to it.  I would describe it as a green “fireball”.  It lasted about 4 seconds.;42.0786076923077;-87.8207923076922
