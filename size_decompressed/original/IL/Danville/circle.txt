No Sound;2007-06-23 22:00:00;20 minutes;Huge, shiny, lights going counter clockwise intermittently Shiny No Displacement of Air Hovered Above me a few feet away. No Sound Year 2007, 3rd week in June.   Finished a late bath took 2 dogs our for potty break.  Looked up at stars looked North, West & when I looked South my eyes ran into a Huge Shiny Coppery colored Circular Ship with lights shining counter clock wise Intermittently.  No sound & no displacement of anything no air blowing anything.  Couldn't see anything except the ship. I stood there Frozen in Shock.  I didn't move an inch my 2 dogs were just sniffing the ground & being still too. It was soo big that I couldn't see anything past it.  It was like a Huge double combine in my way of vision $ I didn't see anything past it, just above it. I wasn't on any medication.  I taught for 18 years & am retired now.  I was 52 when I saw it. Now I'm 59 . When it finally started to leave it went up slowly went sideways  quickly 2 x's then sped off towards the Northwest then Disappeared from sight.  Very Fast.
