Small bright light moving slowly and disappearing.;2019-08-08 21:34:00;1 minute;Small bright light moving slowly and disappearing. Came outside to talk to my mother because I thought I heard my name when during our conversation I looked up to look at the stars and facing away from the house, I saw an extremely bright but small light just slowly inching it's away across the sky.  At first, I thought it was just a small star until I saw it start moving.  Then I thought it was a plane but saw no blue or red lights blinking.  It was also moving TOO slow to be a plane.  Then just as I was about to tell my mother, it vanished.  I tried to find it and soon it appeared a few feet from its first location and it was extremely bright again and still moving slowly.  I managed to get my mother to look but it had already vanished and you could just faintly see a soft light if you strained your eyes enough but my mother couldn't.;40.1420265306123;-87.6294734693878
