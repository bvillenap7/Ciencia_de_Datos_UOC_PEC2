My sister and I were parked on an access road off of HYW 74 and just east of the GM plant. We were watching the annual fireworks display put on by the GM company. It was a clear night with a small amount of wind blowing from the west to the east. About 15 minutes into the show the light from some high fireworks lite up an object traveling from the east to the west. It looked strange and was traveling against the wind and didn't have any lights on. I was able to get a closer look at it with a pair of binoculars that I kept in the car. As the object passed over the GM plant the lights of the plant illuminated the object and gave us a better view. My sister and I took turns veiwing the object with the binoculars. We watched it until it faded into the darkness in the western sky. My sister and I then independantly made seperate drawings of what we saw. We then compared the drawing and they were the same. The object looked like 3 sphere's connected togeather by a Y type structure. One shere was attached to each end of the Y and the object appeared to rotate around the middle of the Y. There was'nt anyway to determine the size or speed or distance or color of the object. We only know what it looked like illuminated by the GM lights.;40.1420265306123;-87.6294734693878
Reddish sphere seen from georgetown Ill in sky North East of Danville Illinois;2014-10-18 22:40:00;15 seconds;Reddish sphere seen from georgetown Ill in sky North East of Danville Illinois I and 7 other passengers was driving back from Georgetown, Ill. to Danville, ILL. around 22:40 on October 18th 2014.  When driving north, I looked to the north east to see what just appeared out of a black sky above the tree line was a pinkish-red color sphere levitating in the air.  I thought it might had been a plane exploding, but never changed it's color nor fell to the ground. It stayed the same color and levitated in one spot,  It was brighter then the stars. it was brighter then the red beacon lights on the towers. it lasted approximately 15 to 30 seconds, then noticed it disappeared with no sound and no movement.;40.1420265306123;-87.6294734693878
