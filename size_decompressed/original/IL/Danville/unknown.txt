Had no sound, faint feel of electric charge in air, strobing lights in continuing pattern. Left suddenly eastward at tremendous rate of speed. My husband and I were called by a neighbor to tell us that something was coming our way that had been outside her house for awhile.  We went outside and stood facing the south in our driveway.  At the end of our driveway, there was something that had to be huge, because it blocked out the stars in the sky.  It was just above the treeline and we could not make out a shape because of treetops coming together over part of it and also because of an outside light behind us that made it hard to get our eyes accustomed to the dark.  It had three large white lights (like spotlights) that strobed in a regular series one after the other and repeated this over and over for the twenty minutes we stood and watched.  There were several red and green lights which did not blink in a row.  There was absolutely no sound, but there was a faint feel of an electrical charge in the air.  No smell.   We stood and watched and it never moved at all, until my husband started to get the car so we could follow it when it left.  As he reached the car, it took off suddenly to the East at a tremendous rate of speed and disappeared.   My husband is a patternmaker by trade and has some college.  I have some college and am a housewife and writer.  We live in the country and have raised our children here.;40.1420265306123;-87.6294734693878
Far away stationary object seen then suddenly disappeared;2006-12-31 15:00:00;2 minutes;Far away stationary object seen then suddenly disappeared On a relatively clear afternoon with some clouds in the sky and the sun shining brightly, I saw a stationary gleaming object to my west, at least a couple miles away in the clear blue sky, maybe 35 degrees above the horizon.  It was so far that I could not make out the shape, but it looked as if it was reflecting sunlight off of it, and it was the size of a dot.   If I took my eyes off of it, I had to carefully scan the region of space again to find it. It was stationary. I did not ever see it move the entire time I watched it.  However, when I looked away for a more extended period, perhaps 15 seconds, I could not find it again. There was no streak of vapor associated with it.;40.1420265306123;-87.6294734693878
