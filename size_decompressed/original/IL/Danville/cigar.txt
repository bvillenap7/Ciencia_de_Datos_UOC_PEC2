Unknown object in sky.;2018-10-29 16:30:00;Unknown;Unknown Object In Sky I was out taking fall pictures at Kickapoo State Park.  I didn't notice anything while I was on location, but when I got home to download my pictures onto my computer, I noticed that there is one picture that has an anomaly in the sky.  I took a couple of shots in the same general area and only one of the pictures has this object in the sky.  I have the RAW file to prove that the object was not added post production.;40.1420265306123;-87.6294734693878
