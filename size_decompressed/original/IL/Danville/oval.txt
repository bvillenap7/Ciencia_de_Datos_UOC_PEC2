Oval object with two glowing lights slowly traveling down low.;2018-08-09 19:18:00;3 minutes;Oval object with two glowing lights slowly traveling down low. We were about to leave to go to my grandma's when my dad called for us to come outside. It was already dark out, keep in mind.  I came outside with my other sibling.  We observed an oval hovercraft, quite medium-sized and hanging low.  It was a dark blue but I think that was because it was dark out and there was no light on it really besides the giant two lights underneath it.  They were circular but they didn't cast light below, just seemed to glow on the hovercraft.   I was attempting to bring out my phone but felt compelled to not take it out and record for some reason.   After it had passed over the trees, I got my phone out and was confused why I couldn't take it out to record it when it was going by.  It made no noise and traveled slow.
