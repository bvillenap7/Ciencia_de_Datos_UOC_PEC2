While I was speaking to my husband, I noticed outside our window which would be north, I noticed an orange light moving across the sky.  The orange light immediatly stopped and than it exploded into a fireball, a perfect circle.  What caught my husband's attention was when the orange light exploded into the fireball, the fireball lite our room and my husband looked outside and also saw the fireball and it disappear.  About 5 minutes after, we heard jets flying accross the sky.  Which is unusual for our area at that time of night.;40.1138;-90.5432
