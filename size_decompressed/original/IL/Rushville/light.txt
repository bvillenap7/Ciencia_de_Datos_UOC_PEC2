4 orange lights luminating in sky and disappearing;1999-09-15 21:05:00;45 minutes;4 orange lights luminating in sky and disappearing I reported a sighting of a fireball for 9/15/99, I'd like to correc it to 9/14/99 at 20:50.  Due to my our sighting on 9/14/99, we told 2 of our friends about it.  We decided to hang out and see what might happen the next night, 9/15/99.  Around 20:45 we saw approx. 5 jets circling our area, this occured until 21:05.  About 21:05 while we searched the northern night sky, it was clear, our friend noticed an orange light luminate and another orange light luminate.  The first one disppeared and then the second disppeared.  Of course, we were excited.  Within 15 minutes we saw the same thing but with 4 orange lights.  Within another 15 minutes we saw orange lights luminate and then disappear.  We attempted to take pictures but won't know if they came out.  None of us have ever seen anything like this before.;40.1138;-90.5432
