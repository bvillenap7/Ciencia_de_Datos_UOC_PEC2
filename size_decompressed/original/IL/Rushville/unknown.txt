TWO BRIGHT ORANGE LIGHTS SIDE BY SIDE AND TWO BRIGHT YELLOW LIGHTS ON THE OUTSIDE OF THEM;1998-08-20 22:00:00;5 MIN.;I WENT OUTSIDE TO CHECK ON A UFO SIGHTING THAT MY BROTHER HAD BEEN OBSERVING A FEW MILES AWAY.  WITHIN 10 MINUTES I SAW TWO BRIGHT ORANGE LIGHTS SIDE BY SIDE AND TWO BRIGHT YELLOW LIGHTS ON THE OUTSIDE OF THEM THE CRAFT HOVERED WHAT SEEMED TO BE A COUPLE HUNDRED YARDS ABOVE THE GROUND WITHOUT NOISE AND WITHOUT ANY FLASHING LIGHTS.  WITHIN A FEW SECONDS OF THE LIGHTS APPEARING, SOMETHING SHOT ACROSS THE SKY HORIZONTALLY.  WHEN IT STOPPED, SOMETHING EMERGED FROM IT GOING PERPENDICULAR.  THEN ONE MORE OBJECT SHOT ACROSS THE SKY FROM THAT LOCATION. SHORTLY AFTER THIS, THE ORIGINAL FOUR LIGHTS DISAPPEARED AND APPEARED AT A FARTHER DISTANCE WITH A CLUSTER OF AROUND FOUR OTHER ORANGE GLOWING OBJECTS, WHICH DISAPPEARED IN ABOUT 10-15 SECONDS.;40.1138;-90.5432
