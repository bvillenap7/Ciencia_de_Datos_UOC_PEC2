Unexplained event in the sky;2010-07-02 20:35:00;20 mins;Unexplained event in the sky It started out as one light in the sky just above the sunset, we pulled over on the side of the road were this one light broke off to three, about a minute later they formed a line, just above the sun.  Thats when we noticed more coming in from the north and south they all joined the formation once they all joined the formation it was a very bright reddish orange almost like it was on fire.   The objects were moving up and down, left and right nothing any plane would be able to do.  For about the next five mintues we watched them fade out or break off until they were all gone.;41.0236;-88.5173
