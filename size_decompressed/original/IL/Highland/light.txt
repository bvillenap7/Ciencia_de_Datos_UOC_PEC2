While looking at the International Space Station Fly directly overhead I saw a bright object that looked to be in pursuit of the Station it flew past the station at incredible speed while pulsing and beaming off light before going dark. When ever it past the station it pulsed one last time and then disappeared. It pulsed about four times and this took place at 5:40 central time in the USA over Illinois.;38.7631;-89.6789
