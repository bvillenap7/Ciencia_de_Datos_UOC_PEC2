I was outside, when i looked up in the sky and saw a couple red lights.  After further looking at them, i called my aunt and uncle out, and they saw them too.  There were three red lights, in a triangle pattern, and after a while they dissappeared sepreatly.  My uncle had also pointed out blue lights, that were scattered accross the sky, one by the red lights, and the two others almost directly across from each other.  These lights dissappeared as well, but after the red ones.;41.578732631579;-87.8132515789474
I saw three bright red lights high up in the sky in the shape of a triangle that eventually aligned into a line and slowly disappeared.;2004-08-21 23:30:00;10 minutes;I saw three bright red lights high up in the sky in the shape of a triangle that eventually aligned into a line and slowly disappeared. My son was at a friend's house in the area, sitting on the front porch.  He called my husband and I. We went to the backyard (facing east).  We looked up into the sky (a little bit southeast)and at that time that we stepped outside, we saw a triangle of three bright red lights.  They seemed to be high up in the sky, and yet so big and red and bright.  I did not see any craft per se.  Then the three lights went into an alignment and one by one within the next few minutes, the lights disappeared into the sky. It looked to me as if they disappeared upward, but I cannot be sure.  I am not positive about the date except that it happened in August. I'm glad to be able to report this. There was an article that appeared in our local paper regarding this sighting with your website address.  At the time that it happened, we looked that week on a NASA website, looked in our newspapers, etc. and didn't see anything about it. Whatever it was, it was very perplexing and like nothing I had ever seen before.  ((name deleted));41.578732631579;-87.8132515789474

I noticed a pitch black trangle about 45 degrees over the horizon. The craft was moving rather slowly. I can say that because I saw a flock of geese flying in between me and the craft and they were moving much faster than teh craft. The craft slowly turned and I could see that it was truly diamond in shape. I pullled my car over to catch a better glimpse of the ship.

Three Solid red Lights over Tinley Park Illinois.;2004-10-31 21:00:00;25 mins;Three Solid red Lights over Tinley Park Illinois. Three Red Orbs moved across the Tinley Park Area. I witnessed then from my back yard which faces the North. The objects moved East VERY slowly. The entire event took approx. 30 minutes. They were low in the sky and seemed to be moving at approx 5-10 miles per hour, maybe less. They were appeared to be 100-1500 feet in the air. I am not good at estimateing that however. There was absolutely NO sound whatsoever coming from the objects. There were several other aircraft in the area at the time. None of them were military and did not take any action towards the objects. This did surprise me. The cloud cover that night was low and somewhat thick. The moon was mostly obscured but could be seen. The moon was in the eastern sky. Temperature was in the low 40's. Very little wind.;41.578732631579;-87.8132515789474

They formed a triangle (in the sky with one top light and two lower lights as a base), a slash (diagonal alignment) and a side by side formation a relatively straight line.  They maneuvered very quickly, changing positions in somewhat of an aero (astro) batic motion.  We followed lights for a distance of approximately 5 miles.  After 20 minutes or so, they suddenly vanished.  I saw red lights but my daughters who didn't have the distration of driving also saw white and yellow elements. After they disappeared we parked in an unlit area to maintain a watch on the sky.   We observed several very slow moving aircraft making a great circle approximately around the sighting area.  Could not tell if they were commercial or military flights.  While watching the sky we also observed some other very high and swift moving objects that were very likely satellites.  At approximately 21:30 we saw a very slow moving aircraft loop this area making a very severe right bank to change its southbound course, through the west to the north, roughly parallel to La Grange Rd. (Rt. 45)  that craft went north to the horizon and then proceeded along that north horizon to disappear to our northeast.  Unsure if this craft was related to the sighting.  We broke off our observations at 21:35 and headed home (Frankfort).  My older daughter thought she saw a smaller object detach from one of the three red lights.  We had seen one of the August 24th red lights take a similar route before it too disappeared.;41.578732631579;-87.8132515789474

Another red light met w/it and they moved on together. I was working nights cleaning salons and came outside to notice a red light moving quickly across the night sky. It was the size of a star so I thought it was a satellite. I kept watching and saw it slow down and stop. It remained stopped for at least a few minutes. Then another red light came towards it in the same path it had just gone. When they came within what looked like inches apart with the naked eye, they both moved along slowly together. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I wanted to keep watching but had to move on to my other salons. It was only a 5 minute drive from where I was. I continued working, when I came outside later on I looked up to see three lights in a triangular formation moving across the sky. I can’t quite remember if each light looked like the same red star, or if it was possibly white lights of planes chasing what I’d seen. It was so long ago I can’t remember exactly. I just know it was an experience I’ll never forget. I’ve never seen anything like it since. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Tinley Park Lights  3 Red Lights form a Triangle;2010-09-17 21:56:00;15 minutes;Tinley Park Lights  3 Red Lights form a Triangle @ 9:50pm I took my two dogs outside for the last time for the night.  As I was standing there facing west, I clearly saw 3 red lights in the form of a triangle moving towards the NorthEast.  It is extremelt clear out at this time.  I sprinted inside and looked at the clock to confirm the sighting time. 9:56pm.  I literally jumped out of my shoes and scared the hell out of my wife who was brushing her teeth. After a few moments, maybe 60-70 seconds, she found the video camera and I raced back out side, her following as she had seen them the Halloween night as well. Much to my dissapointment, the lights were noplace to be found.  My wife gave up looking after a few and said call her if I see them again. Standing outside, I noted the conditions. What stood out right away to me was the complete lack of air traffic in my area.  There are always planes somewhere to be seen in the sky.  Nothing. Not a sound. After about 10 mins I gave up but I did notice that as I was coming in, planes began to appear again. It stood out because it was so odd to me. Night was crisp (65deg) and skies were clear with a light haze to the west.  I believe Mars was in the western sky low on the horizon.  But the Lights I saw were clearly much closer and could no way be interpreted as being a part of what I saw.;41.578732631579;-87.8132515789474

I am a retired police officer and myself, my wife, and two friends were watching forth of July fireworks.  We live in Tinley Park Il. and was watching in the direction of Frankfort Il which is South of us.   We had an un-obstructed view of the fireworks over a small lake when all of a sudden I observes three bright red glowing circular shaped objects on the South horizon.  The objects rose up and proceeded in a steady speed in a North East direction.  The objects continued to glow from red to yellow and sometimes green.   Over the next three hours we saw numerous objects, sometime in formations of three or four and one time in a V formation of three and one following.   All of the objects originated from the South and continued in a N/E direction.  At one point, as one of the objects were about to travel directly over us, the object lost its glow and I was able to see the object in a stelth type mode as it went over us.  The object appeared to by fairly l! arge and  looked triangular with rounded edges.  I saw three large circulat shapes in the center of the object.   There was absolutely no sound and the object continued overhead Northbound. We saw at least 20 to 30 of the same objects during the corse of the night and at another point I observed and videoed what appeared to be one of the objects blow up and split in two. This caused a large bright explosion and sparks.;41.578732631579;-87.8132515789474
