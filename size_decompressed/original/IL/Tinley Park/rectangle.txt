Black rectangle object moving from Southeast to Northwest.;2011-04-24 11:45:00;1 minute;Black rectangle object moving from Southeast to Northwest. The funny thing about this sighting is that you could not have seen this without sun glasses or a tinted window.  I have a Ford Taurus and I happened to be looking thru the sun roof tinted window as I was parked getting ready to get out of the car, and noticed a black rectangular shaped object very very high above me moving southeast to northwest.  I got out of the car and lost it in the sun, got back into the car & looked thru the sunroof window once again and found it again.  It didn't have any wings, moved in a straight line, looked like a black shoebox, or the underneath of a black platform.  I witnessed the triangle in Tinley Park years ago at night, but this is the first time I have seen something I can't explain during the daytime.
