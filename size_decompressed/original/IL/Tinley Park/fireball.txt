3 Bright Red objects spotted in the atmosphere moving  and blinking with NO SOUND!;2004-08-21 22:00:00;15 min;3 Bright Red objects spotted in the atmosphere moving  and blinking with NO SOUND! Three red stars, moving nsync through the sky, fading in and out.  I have pictures and video, these things were cruising through the sky silently and in perfect sequence. ((NUFORC Note:  We have indicated above an arbitrary time for the event.  We assume the witness alludes to the dramatic appearance of three red lights seen over Tinley Park, IL, on the evening of Saturday, August 21, 2004.  PD;41.578732631579;-87.8132515789474
3 bright Orange lights over Tinley Park, IL slow moving;2004-10-31 20:00:00;45;3 bright Orange lights over Tinley Park, IL slow moving Late on Sun at or around 8:30-8:45 I was looking South East and could very clearly see a ball of orange light that was made up of 3 such balls. They did not have any type of avation lights, white , strobe or green and red. They were heading due East by North East steady. The 3 lights then sperated and began to move away from each other for a time then 2 of them started to form back up again then after about 30 or 40 min they passed behind or above the overcast sky and I was not able to pick them up again. I have watched the sky and I pride myself on being a aviation buff I have never seen that color of orange red glow from a craft, I have never seen anything that bright or to that fact not make a sound, they did look like they were hovering or moving at the time I witnessed this with the wind..  Very strange... ((deleted));41.578732631579;-87.8132515789474
