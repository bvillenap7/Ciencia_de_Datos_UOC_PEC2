I wondered what idiot helicopter pilot was hovering so dangerously close above me;1979-08-10 21:00:00;moments;I wondered what idiot helicopter pilot was hovering so dangerously close above me Traveling west on 175th St in an undeveloped area, I approached a stop sign at 80th Ave.  When I stopped I became aware of a red light hovering above my car (there were no electric signals at this intersection). My first thought was that it was a helicopter, and I was wondering what idiot was flying so low! It didn't seem to move, so I looked up through the windshield of my car, but could not see anything except the light.  As I looked, the light 'took off' to the west, and within a second or two was a pinpoint red dot, then disappeared. The area I was in was, at the time, all rural undeveloped prairie and farmland. It was very dark, and there was no other traffic and very little artificial light in the far distance. Not until the light disappeared did I realize that there had been no sound or turbulence that might be expected of a helicopter in flight.  I don't know what it was, but I will never forget it.  I sat at the stop sign for several minutes before proceeding to my destination.;41.578732631579;-87.8132515789474
It looked like two strobe lights flying together;1998-07-20 02:00:00;5 to seven min;It looked like two strobe lights flying together My friend and I were driving home frome having coffee at about 2 in the morning. Were traveling east bound on I 80, between Tinley Park and I 57 is were the sighting took place.  I looked up towards the north and observed what looked like a low flying plane traveling at a very high rate of speed.  But after looking at it for a while I noticed it didn't look like a plane at all, it was actually two lights on the botom of some craft that bliked at the exact same time, about 3 second intervals.  What was so srtange is that there weren't any other lights on the craft.  Also  it was going really fast. It was out of sight within 3 min. It traveled along I 80 for about a min. and then took a sharp turn to the north and flew out of sight.  It went towards lake Michigan not towards the airports. It just didn't look like any plane I have ever seen flying around here, with the two airports (Ohare and Midway) I see planes all the time and what they look like at night, this just didn't have the normal plane or jet lights.  There was also a Pasenger jet off in the distance and we compared the two and they looked nothing alike.;41.578732631579;-87.8132515789474
Three Red Lights in Illinois;2001-10-31 20:00:00;15 Minutes;Three Red Lights in Illinois We were sitting in a local bar watching the football game that was on when I got a phone call to go outside to see the red lights I didn't see them at first but then five minutes later there they were.  At appoximately 171st and Oak Park Ave. in Tinley Park IL three red lights were just sitting moitionless in the sky in a straight uniform evenly spaced line. The objects made no noise at all  After about five minutes one of the lights moved and the three lights formed a Triangular shape.  After which the lights started heading east in a very slow manner.  They were very high in the air and were just a solid red light no indicator lights like on a plane or helicopter.  It was something amazing to witness and the local paper reports that they are unsure of what it was.  After about 10 more mintues the 2 of the lights disappeared into the cloud cover and the night. Shortly after the third and final red light was gone as well.  The paper reports one of the lights been spotted again briefly at about 9:30 PM;41.578732631579;-87.8132515789474
Red Light Hovering Motionless In the Sky;2004-04-24 01:30:00;3 -5 minutes;Red Light Hovering Motionless In the Sky At 0130 hrs on 4/24/04, I was driving westbound on I-80 through the far southern suburbs of Chicago.  Upon crossing under the Harlem Ave. overpass, I noticed a single cherry-red colored light hanging motionless in the sky south/southwest of the expressway at about a 70 degree angle to the horizon. It was about the size and intensity of a very bright star.  At first I thought it to be the port-side red wing light on a plane but the odd thing was there were no other navigation lights visible (no belly or tail strobe, no green starboard wing light, etc.) I also thought that it might be a star or planet at first, but as I drove westward I eventally passed under it at which time it was then behind me (but still motionless in the same position on the sky). I then got off of I-80 and headed southbound on U.S. Route 45 (LaGrange Rd.) and the light was still there in it's original position with my car now headed south and the light being to my left still at about 70 degrees to the now eastern horizon.  Although I couldn't tell how big or high up it really was, I got the impression that it was lower than planes would be heading into Midway Airport (I was at 19500 south and Midway is at 6300 south on the Chicago area's street grid).  Also of note was there was no noise, and if it were a helicopter, I think I would have been close enough to hear the rotors, see other navigation lights and probably even see some of the body of a helicopter.  There was no shape discernible here...just the bright, hovering pinpoint of light.  After briefly heading west on 195th St., I then turned south, but when I looked for the light in the eastern sky, it was gone.  I noticed the light had a vey crisp, clean color to it...no twinkling like a star and it's color was differant than a red radio antanea light or plane wing light...it was almost the shade of those old blue dot taillights or maybe those bright new LED lights used on new stop lights and railroad crossings.  NOTE - Although I do have an interest in UFO's, this was the first time I've seen or reported anything unidentified first-hand. ((NUFORC Note:  Please see similar reports for 21AU04 in same location.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM ORIGINAL WITNESS)) Tinley Park Follow-up I was the individual who submitted the original Tinley Park red light sighting back in April. I can't possibly imagine that the light was caused by advertising lasers as there would be absolutely no way to determine where the advertiser was located on the ground (hence not a very effective means of advertising).....also, there was no light trail leading to a spot on the ground like a traditional advertising spot light would have (either the single oscillating beam kind or the newer 4 -beam type that makes the figure-8's in the sky).  Also, when I saw the light, it was in the early AM when all retail would be closed.  While brighter than a star, it really wouldn't have been all that noticable unless you looked up into that exact area of the sky and you realized it wasn't the normal red color of an airplane wing light and that it was stationary (in other words, it didn't appear to be anything designed to attract the attention of peo ple on the ground).  Lastly, the area I saw it over contains warehouses, some residential subdivisions and vacant fields but no retail or late night places such as bars or all-night restraunts.  Here's a thought - The Tweeter Center (the Chicago area's main outdoor music amphitheater) isn't far away from the area in Tinley Park where I saw the light....could they possibly have a laser projection system that was pointed upward instead of towards the stage???  I've been to Tweeter in the past however and I think all of their lighting and projection stuff is under a pavilion roof so it wouldn't have exposure to the sky...also I don't recall any clouds the evening I saw the light that a laser would bounce off of....it just seemed to be hovering mid-air in a clear sky (but no indication of anything solid attached to, or behind the light).  Also, I think 4/24 was too early in the season for Tweeter to be having concerts and even if they were, the event  would have been long over at the time I passed the area.  Anyone else have thoughts on the mystery?? ((END ADDENDUM));41.578732631579;-87.8132515789474
Lights over Tinley Park.;2004-08-21 00:00:00;20 minutes;Lights over Tinley Park My friend called me outside to look at them.  There were three red lights in a linear, equadistant formation and not moving.  After a short time they began to move from southwest to northeast, remaining in formation.  After a short distance, they stopped and the began to form a triangle formation with the lead light staying put and the other two lights moving north and south to form a triangle.  After about ten minutes without movement, the two lights moved back into a linear formation behind the lead light.  Five minutes later, the lead light started to move and disappeared.  Then the second light started to move and disappeared.  And finally the third light.  We heard no noise.  Being so close to Midway and O'hare airports we see and hear planes often.  During this event we noticed we couldn't find lights from a plane anywhere.  We thought that was odd.  The lights seemed to be hovering over Chicago, estimating angle and distance.  Also, Chicago had an air and water show that day.  But the lights didn't look like anything I've seen before and I spent six years in the military.  The precision of movement and peculiar dissapearance were very strange. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Three blinking lights that do not appear to be airplanes;2004-08-21 22:00:00;30 MINUTES;Three blinking lights that do not appear to be airplanes. . We were at a block party located about 2 blocks off of Oak Park Avenue when we noticed three red lights in the western sky.  The lights were moving east, very slowly.  It looked like three separate objects all moving at the same speed.   The three lights formed a triangular shape.  We observed this for about 15 minutes and the lights seemed to move closer together.  Two of the lights stayed together while the third red light moved away.  This red light that was moving away stayed in one spot, blinked very slowly a few times, and then went completely out.  We could not see the other two anymore, either.   Since this site is asking for a description of my background, let me say that I am an educated, intelligent, and logical person.  I am not what you would consider a person who believes in the supernatural.  I generally believe there is a logical reason for everything.  I have never seen anything like this before.

3 red lights hovering in tinley park in odd shapes that came together as one and flew away.;2004-08-21 22:00:00;30-45 minutes;3 red lights hovering in tinley park in odd shapes that came together as one and flew away. Late this night, Im not exactly sure what time it was to be honest, it was really long ago, I was just talking to someone about ufo sightings and how I had this experience but never thought much of it, even though at the time it was pretty spectacular.   So I googled it and found all this information on it, including this website, it was really wierd, and really interesting because everything I read was exactly what I had seen. And its so hard to explain it to someone that didnt see it and still seem sane.  But what happened was me and my gf at the time were outside talking and noticed these lights, one at first, then 3, they hovered in a way, coming very close together at times and then separating, moving in sparatic ways.  It was shaped in a triangle at times but not always, and sometimes it was a close knit triangle and other times a very distance but still resembled a triangle triangle.  Sometimes the lights were very bright red and other times dim, they did seem to turn white for a min or two, not very long though.  Then finally the lights all came together into one and it was a bright red like hovering and finally it seemed to moved away from the earths atmosphere because it slowly got dimmer until you couldnt see the red light anymore.   THere is NOO way this was an airplane as say by some agencies and governments.  It honestly couldnt have been explained, they moved in such different and odd ways.  Also anything with a motor (helicopers... whatever) would have been heard. you didnt hear anything and no distinct flying object was actually identified except for the lights.  Not to mention there were 3 then they all came together... thats just odd.  No man made object splits into three and comes back together to form one.   We called a bunch of friends and people we knew and they all saw it too. we lived roughly at 181st and 84th ave in tinley park, Il. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of the event may be approximate.

They did not blink.  They looked like stars, however they were red and there were 2 above and 1 below forming a triangle of sorts.  the bottom light moved up towards the 2 higher ones. This was only discernable over a 15 minute time span as I believe they had to be very far away.  Until then It was hard to see any noticeable movement.  Upon Arriving home I noticed my neighbor staring up at the same objects and discussed it with him.  No noises were heard.  The air and water show I believe was this same weekend in Chicago.  We thought maybe some unusual military aircraft.  However, this was the middle of the night and the lights were not blinking.

A different take on the three lights above Tinley Park, IL 0n 08/31/04;2004-08-31 19:54:00;10 minutes;A different take on the three lights above Tinley Park, IL 0n 08/21/04 I have recently read the report listed on your website that describes the lights seen during the 08/31/04 Tinley Park incident as being part of one object and would like to take this opportunity to disagree.  I and my wife saw the lights and I believe that they were three distinctly seperate objects.  After being alerted to the lights by a family member in Oak Forest we looked up from the area of 179th street and 67th Avenue.  In the Eastern sky we saw the three lights in what appeared to be an almost straight line from top to bottom with the bottom light a little further to the right (South) of the others.  As we watched the middle light moved to the right (South) of both of the others forming a triangle of sorts.  A couple of minutes later the bottom light moved up into the place that second light (the one that had moved out when the triangle was formed) was and a semi-straight line was again formed before the lights disappeared.  This movement is why I believe that these three lights were completely autonomous and seperate.

They were aproximatly 400 yards from each other and followed the first one exactly. the light was a very bright and rich red color that did not waver in any way as they made thier way east. The lights went up to about 7 or 800 feet in the air before leveling off. Thier speed was so slow I found myself thinking they were very large balloons that were lit up some how. I watched a commercial plane flew by and the plane was just north of them and it did not seem to affect the lights in any way.

On October 31, 2004 at approximatly 7:50 pm I saw three red lights in the sky. The lights were in a horrizontal line moving very slowly. I witnessed the lights in Tinely Park, IL about 1 mile east of Lagrange Rd. and 1.5 miles south of 171st Street. There were three other witnesses with me. One of the witnesses filmed the event with a hand held camcorder. The lights were a vibrant red much like a stop light. The lights were just south of my location and heading east. As they passed over me I heard no sound and could not see any discernable shape. When the lights header east they changed into a triangle pattern. Then some of the lights began to fade in and out. They nearly faded to black before becoming bright again. The lights were larger than a planet and larger than the lights from the wings of a plane. There was only the one red light emitted from each object. The spacing between the three lights remained relatively constant even when they changed their formation. While witnessing the event I called my uncle in Oak Forest(a town further east). He to witnessed the lights, and he described them just as I did. I called the police at 8:03 pm to report what I had seen. I was told that I was the second caller and that they had no idea what the lights were. I continued to watch the lights until they were out of my view. I then called my uncle again to find that he could still see them. He watched them for another 25 minutes. During this time they went back to the horrizontal line formation. Then he said that one of the lights disappeared.

Started with two lights in lower left, side-by-side and third upper right from the two.  After about 15 minutes moved to a triagle shape and then faded or moved east where they could no longer been seen. A plane happened to pass below lights and it was clear to see the difference in lights and these red lights were not that of a plane or blimp. The red lights seem much more off into space than a plane would be.  There was no engine sounds.  We have video of the lights.;41.578732631579;-87.8132515789474

They started out in a gradual L formation.  The were moving very slowly.  There was no noise, like an airplane or helicopter would make.  It then seemed like they were moving closer to one another.  They moved into a perfect L formation, then a straight vertical formation, and then a triangular formation (one at the top two at the bottom).  Then, the top light seemed to fall quickly out of place, going straight down.  And eventually you couldn't see it anymore.  It seemed to disappear.  The other two kept moving slowly, not changing positions.  Then they seemed to gradually move away from one another.  It was a cloudy/foggy night, so the other two eventually disappeared.  Then at about 9:20pm that same evening, another bright red light was seen moving East, all by itself.  It was only visible for a few minutes, then disappeared.;41.578732631579;-87.8132515789474

From the location of 181st & 66th Ct. in Tinley Park, there were 3 red lights in the NW sky.   They traveled slowly and without any noise in a SE direction.  They seemed to travel in a triangle formation, changing angles but never out of formation.  They traveled directly overhead before they sped off directly E in a line formation and disappeared out of sight.  I do recall that were no other aircraft in the sky during this, i.e. airplanes, which was very unusual.

Three balls of red over Tinley Park, IL;2004-10-31 20:30:00;20 minutes;Three balls of red over Tinley Park, IL Around 20:30 I was called outside by my partner to witness three brights lights hovering in the hazy night sky above our townhouse.  Our townhouse is located near 18600 South Oak Park Avenue in Tinley Park, Illinois.  It was a damp and hazy night. We both watched the three very bright red lights hover above us.  They had no other color to them besides bright red.  They barely moved and made no sound. The lights stayed mostly in a triangular formation, but it flexuated from time to time.  These lighted objects gradually moved over time towards the east, their pattern eventually became more irregular.  One became dimmer, then dropped down a bit before disappearing from view.  Then another eventually disappeared from view, but not in any particular direction.  The last remaining one was visible on the eastern horizon for another 5 minutes.  The duration of this entire episode from my perspective was about 20 minutes.;41.578732631579;-87.8132515789474

We saw and heard known objects flying (specifically a loud sounding helicopter) and also there was these 2 or 4 jet looking aircrafts (appearing to be escorting) aside the spaces of the 3 UFO's.

Red lights slowly move from East to West and back again;2004-10-31 21:00:00;15 minutes;Red lights slowly move from East to West and back again a 54 year old retired corporate manager was sitting on her patio near 88th Ave and 183 St in Tinley Park, watching airplanes go through their flight patterns to and from Midway airport.  A Very bright red light was moving from East to West just North of her location. It appeared odd since she did not see any other customary lights as on an aircraft. It also was so slow moving as make her wonder if it could be a helicopter. After a few minutes it appeared to hover to the West & she decided to have her husband come out to view it. Her husband had been a private pilot in previous years and spent time boating. Since he was familiar with various lights of navigation and aircraft she felt he might be able to add some insight as to what this was. He watched the light but could not identify what type of aircraft or blimp or balloon would appear like this so he brought out his binoculars. In looking through the binoculars he felt he could see 2 red lights, 1 slightly above and to the North of the other. He was not able to see any craft nor was he able to tell if the lights were independant or associated with a single object. They were moving syncronized. There was no engine noise detectable although throughout the sighting other aircraft were still in the area. From the time he observed the lights he felt the location of the lights was approximately 10 degrees North and 45 degrees West of where they sat. The lights headed back East (no apparent turn just changed direction) and ended up at about 10 degrees North and 45 degrees East when the husband went back into the house to see if he could see them from the front windows and if so he would see if his telescope could pick them up any better. He could not view them from the front windows and his wife informed him they were now gone. As his wife watched the lights moving East they had again seemed to hover as planes passed. This East area of the sky was hazy and cloudy. Although most airplane lights and the moon light was visable through the haze, the red lights seemed to either go on and off several times (or went behind clouds)and then were gone.  Throughout the viewing the lights appeared to become intermittently brighter or more brillant. We are guessing that the entire event took from about 9 PM to about 9:10 or 9:15 PM.;41.578732631579;-87.8132515789474

Earlier we saw 3 red lights (very bright at first) in formation and a few minutes ago, my neighbor (one of the 10 people that saw the earlier 3 red light formation) called and said that there was a single red light in the sky, Eastern sky of Tinley Park from 18000 and 88th Avenue.  What was strange is that you could see planes all over the place in the other parts of the sky as we get a lot of flight pattern from 2 of Chicago's airports, and this light was not moving at all.  Just stationary for the most part.  Then it blinked, and faded a tad, and then it was gone.  But it did not fade away, it just blinked and then faded to black in 2-3 seconds.  A very similar aircraft with lots of flashing lights also flew very, very close to the red light a few minutes after we first saw it, and unlike the other planes in the area, this one had lots of flashing lights (almost like the lights on top of a police car) and it seemed to fly towards this red light intentionally as if it was trying to observe it.;41.578732631579;-87.8132515789474

Eventually the light just seemed to disappear. Then the moon was weird like in the movies where the clouds just part not fluffy like clouds, they seemed thick and dark slowly parting away from the moon.

Red light moving over Chicago's South Suburbs during White Sox World Series.;2005-10-22 20:35:00;10 minutes;Red light moving over Chicago's South Suburbs during White Sox World Series. We were attending a Boy Scout campout and bonfire at Camp Falcon in the Cook County Forest Preserves in Tinley Park, a very densely populated area. (Most people in Chicago were at home watching the first game of the World Series that the White Sox were playing.)  The night sky was very clear and starry.  At about 8:35 p.m.,  in the east/southeast sky, about 35 degrees above the horizon, several of us parents noticed a bright light that we assumed was a airplane moving toward our location many miles off.  The light did not fly in a straight line and we all took notice of this.  The motion of the light was very fluid back and forth as it flew toward our location from the east.  As the light approached closer, still miles away, the light became larger and red in color and the light from it appeared to have  rays or spikes  radiating from the center (like a stereotypical depiction of a bright star/star of Bethlehem).   The light began to dramatically fall some distance.  It grew much brighter and glowed orange-red, and we all assumed this must be a giant meteor coming down. It did not fall too far though, and again gained some altitude, started flying again and proceeded extremely fast mainly south-southwest.  It was never flying in a straight line and always wandering from side-to-side or up-and-down.  It then appeared to explode, but the light did not disappear, it again looked more white and flew very fast far to the south.  We lost sight of it as it went over the tree line.  The light never got very close to our campsite and at the highest was about 50-55 degrees up from the horizon.  There were about 200 people present, most of whom were paying attention to scout activities around a very large campfire.  I would estimate that about 20 to 30 people were actively watching this strange light with amazement.;41.578732631579;-87.8132515789474

At first I thought it might be a sattillite, but I have never seen a sattillite that bright before and it wouldn't be that low.

2 Flashing Lights In Tinley Park;2008-09-27 13:00:00;3 minutes;2 Flashing Lights In Tinley Park 1 pm sunny & clear with hardly a breeze, doing yardwork, I noticed 2 lights in the sky quite high up. They remained together but there was some movement or flashing?? I could not make it out clearly but thought it could have been 2 balloons and perhaps they were turning, with one side being reflective to cause the flash I was seeing. The speed  was minimal, they seemed to be floating along but so high up and no clouds to tell if they were going with a breeze or not. They came from the northeast and drifted southwest. I had time to run in the house, get my camera and take one photo before the trees obscured my view. I was surprised the photo shows 2 lights of different colors,one round and one more oval, and something darker between them that is difficult to make out due to the distance. I also witnessed the 3 red lights in Tinley Park a few years ago and reported it. There were a few sightings of 3 red lights forming a triangle. My friend and I watched this one night. Then a few months later many people saw the same thing occuring on Halloween night.

2 Glowing orbs of light went over my yard in Tinley Park, IL about a minute apart on July 3rd at 9 pm.;2011-07-03 18:57:00;2 minutes;2 Glowing orbs of light went over my yard in Tinley Park, IL about a minute apart on July 3rd at 9 pm. It was July 3rd, starting to get dark, I was outside hoping to see some fireworks from my yard. I saw what I thought was a plane approaching from the east.  I thought I saw a flashing light but realized quickly the whole light was glowing brighter and it was sure not a flashing light like on a little plane... like I am used to seeing. (I am in the pathway of midway airport so very familiar with smaller as well as commercial planes going by.)  I ran inside, dumped my purse, grabbed my camera and managed to take a shaky video.  I was trying to watch it while taking the video.  I did pretty good I thought, I got something.  All I could make out was that it was a bright white to yellow light that pulsed brighter every few seconds and the edges were more orange or red.   This was not a plane.  There was no sound. it seemed to almost drift by and I would have to guess on the height and size because it was getting dark... but a wild estimation I would say it could have been as small as a beach ball or as large as a car, height was higher than the lowest planes I've seen go by, but not very high.  Well the coolest thing happened within a minute!!!!   ANOTHER one came over my yard and followed if not the same exact pathway, pretty darn close to it.  They both came from the east, went over my yard at a slight southwest angle and then I lost sight of them as they went over the trees.  That helps me determine height because if much higher I would have been able to see them further.  Both glowing lights lasted about a minute from the moment I saw them to the moment I lost sight of them.   I am sending my videos taken 2 minutes apart!  Side note:  I did see the Tinley Park Red Ufo lights back about 6 or 7 years ago when thousands of people saw them forming a triangular pattern... so this is the second time I have seen curious lights in the area.;41.578732631579;-87.8132515789474
Array of lights over Tinley Park, IL.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of star or planet, we suspect.  PD));2012-02-20 00:25:00;still going;Array of lights over Tinley Park Illinois My son and I were sitting inside when we noticed flickering of different color lights outside.  It came from what seemed to be a single source.  It has been staying in place, in the sky, for some time now.  The colors change from blue and purple to green and red. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  Possible sighting of a star or planet, we suspect.  PD));41.578732631579;-87.8132515789474
Light over Tinley Park.  No sound or running lights.;2014-01-13 18:50:00;2-3 minutes;Light over Tinley Park. No sound or running lights Strange light in skies over Tinley Park.  Light moved from North to south at a seemingly slow rate of speed.  No sound what so ever came from the light.  I am writing this as I have just come inside and trying to remember everything.  Lots of plane activity in skies.  Passed between what I think was Venus and the very bright moon.  Skies are very clear.   NO running lights were visible which is what caught my attention.  I saw a very bright light coming across the sky.  It passed directly over and in front of me.  Almost looked like there were two afterburners on back side but again, no sound at all.  It never changed pace. Thought I would see running lights from the back but nothing.  I followed it until I could no longer see the light. 2-3 mins I think.   I had two dogs out side and no reaction from them as far as I could tell. I first thought the object was very high in the sky because I couldn't see the running lights.  As it passed over me, I got the feeling it was much lower than I first thought.  I was looking to see if I could make out any kind of wing or fuselage but I could not.  It was clearly a craft of some kind as there was a discernable distance between the initial single light and the back after burnerlights.  Once past me the single light was gone/blocked and the after burner lights appeared.  No flame from them...that was just my impression of what I saw.  Saw 2 lights on back.  These seemed like a softer glowing orange.  The Single light was a brighter yellow/whiteish light.  I went outside at 6:50pm to let my dogs out.;41.578732631579;-87.8132515789474
First witnessed a tiny blinking light very high in the sky and thought it was a plane. Upon further examination the lights were blinkin;2014-03-30 23:48:00;5 minutes;First witnessed a tiny blinking light very high in the sky and thought it was a plane.   Upon further examination the lights were blinking sporadically and not in any particular order (Red, Blue, and White). Then as I scanned the sky, I saw a giant white orb of light hovering in the distance fairly close to the ground (it was further away but from my angle it was almost level with my neighbor's roof).  My sister and I watched that light for about three minutes then it began to shrink and move sporadically.   It started blinking just as the other one had and quickly moved out of our line of vision.;41.578732631579;-87.8132515789474
5 Very Interesting orange red lights;2014-05-10 21:35:00;4 minutes;5 Very Interesting orange red lights heard a fire truck siren, then happened to look up towards the east, and saw the first three of five orange red lights heading to the north.   The first three (moving fast like a jet plane) disappeared just over the Orland Park area, the final two (bringing up the rear) were flying slower,  one shifted to the north east, the other slowed and stopped over the Orland Park area and then disappeared.  There were no sounds that we could hear from them, just the orange red light.;41.578732631579;-87.8132515789474
25-35 red orange lights/circular and rectangular craft;2016-07-30 21:00:00;15 minutes;25-35 Red orange lights / circular and rectangular craft I am a 53 yr old female and have seen strange lights in the sky over the years, but nothing like this! I scrambled to get camera and video but could only get some still shots due to memory and low batteries.   Over the course of about 15 minutes, I observed at least 25 red orange lights coming over my yard low and silent.  They came from the northeast and most traveled Southwest, with a few veering off to the west and south.  They would come over one or two at a time.  I was so excited, I started flashing some patio lights and in response I believe, one of the craft shut its light off.  I could then see that there was a much larger circular shaped dark object where the light had been.  Another one shut its light off a bit later and that time it looked more rectangular and flat to me.   I was left wondering who was that?  Us or them?  Is that our government testing things or is that something from a place far away?  I waited this year to see if they would come back on the same day but nothing.  My photos only look like fuzzy lights, but show the red orange color and I have some shots with 2 lights, time stamps 9 PM to 9:10;41.578732631579;-87.8132515789474
2 solid red lights in flying formation fly from east to west.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible Perseid meteor??  PD));2018-08-10 21:30:00;20 minutes;2 solid red lights in flying formation fly from east to west. 2 red lights seen moving in perfect formation from east sky to west sky.  Looked like helicopters in formation but moved very slow with out noise.  Jets we seen flying above.  Separation of lights was approximately 1500ft.   Sparks-like material dropped from trailing light in Western sky then light went out.  Second light stayed on for another minute then was turned off.    Went back on for 30 seconds then disappeared.   Was not a planet as those can be seen in picture. ((NUFORC Note:  See similar reports from Tinley Park, IL, for August 21, 2004, and October 31, 2004.  PD));41.578732631579;-87.8132515789474
