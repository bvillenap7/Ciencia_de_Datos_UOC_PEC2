4 red lights that were not airplane or from laser;2004-08-21 22:00:00;30min;4 red lights that were not airplane or from laser 3 red lights heading from west to east for a period of 15-20 minutes, and then fizzing/flaming out.  Then one red light after that, doing the same exact thing. We watched with binoculars, but could not determine height, except very high. Could also not really tell difference in the light with or without bino's except when it flamed/faded out.  The color definitely changed from a red to a light red/orange before disappearing, almost like a match or amber when it goes out.  Therefore, not an airplane, and not a stupid laser;41.578732631579;-87.8132515789474
UFO Sighting on October 25, 2008 in Tinley Park, Illinois West on I-80;2008-10-25 22:45:00;10 seconds;UFO Sighting on October 25, 2008 in Tinley Park, Illinois West on I-80 I was heading west on I-80 in the far left lane when I noticed a interesting blue oval shaped object fly past my car.  I noticed it when I saw the shape come over the top of my windshield and it moved a brief distance ahead and disappeared instantly, perhaps not even 1 car length to 2 car lengths ahead of me.  It was just to the right of the interstate road lights that were in the median of the expressway. The height of the object was slightly above that of the interstate lamp poles and to the right slightly of the extending lamp unit itself.  It was odd as I was speaking to my passenger when this occurred and I said nothing and kept talking when my passenger said 'did you see that?'  I was convinced we saw an anomoly that was not explainable such as shooting star or aircraft.;41.578732631579;-87.8132515789474
Four Yellowish bright lights seemed to move in the same direction where two of them later moved in the opposite direction.;2013-06-02 21:10:00;5 minutes;Four Yellowish bright lights seemed to move in the same direction where two of them later moved in the opposite direction. I was coming home with my family in my car and I saw 4 bright oval shaped lights moving from north to south.  We stopped our car to look at it and we saw that the 4 shapes were moving in the same direction.  Then two of those shapes stopped for couple seconds and changed velocity in the opposite direction.  The two that were moving in the opposite direction blinked for a second and then disappeared into the sky.  The other two shapes kept moving from north to south for about a minute and disappeared one by one.  Each shaped blinked at least once before it disappeared.  This may be due to the clouds.  I was looking at those shapes at a 45 degree elevation.  In my background there were street lights and cars passing by. My mother was at a neighbor's house at the same time and she described similar characteristics but the objects seemed bigger and more light was observed at the bottom of the shapes.  She explained that she saw the four objects moving from south to north then it seemed to come down a little and then went back up.  They finally started going in the direction of north to south.  She said she saw the objects couple minutes before we started noticing them.;41.578732631579;-87.8132515789474
