The lights were very visable, they stayed around for awhile, I think about 45 min. that I noticed, but maybe more or less.  I think they were in the northern sky.  I did not see anything except these red lights, there were always in the set of three.  They were maybe 45 deg. in the horizon.;41.578732631579;-87.8132515789474

Three red lights seen hovering and moving.;2004-08-21 22:50:00;3-5;Three red lights seen hovering and moving. My wife and I, who live near the Tinley Park Post Office at 171st Street and Harlem Avenue, were coming home at the time that three bright red lights were seen hovering in the eastern sky.  There was no sound made by any.  There were no airplanes in the area which we are very familiar with as we get lots of Midway and Gary, Indiana flights overhead.  The lights appeared to make a triangular formation and hovered that way for a couple minutes.  I went into the house to get a camera and they were gone.  I thought that maybe the lights were from the Tweeter Center for a concert or something but there was nothing scheduled there at the time that would have used red promotional or laser lights.  I didn't post this message until today when I heard about numerous similar sightings that night and mention of this web sight on WBBM Radio (780 AM).  I am a trial attorney living in Tinley Park and I was blown away by the sight of theses thing.  I am a former skydiver and know for a fact that these things were not planes or helicopters.  They could move a fairly long distance very quickly and then just stop and hover.;41.578732631579;-87.8132515789474

3 red lights in the sky on Halloween night in Tinley Park--Eastern Sky;2004-10-31 19:40:00;15 minutes;3 red lights in the sky on Halloween night in Tinley Park--Eastern Sky I am not sure how long the formation was visible as my nephew called me to let me know that some customers (he works at a restaurant nearby) had come in talking about seeing 3 red lights in the sky.  I had just left a neighbors house and was heading home when I saw the 3 red lights in the sky in a long triangle formation.  Shortly thereafter, maybe 5 minutes, I saw a airplane (slow moving) or helicopter fly directly into the formation or very close to it, and the shapes did not move or fade.  This area had a lot of air traffic from Midway and O'Hare airports and what was unusual was that these lights did not move at all as far as distance but they did seem to rotate after awhile as if a flag was being turned in the sky and rotating.  I went back to the neighbors house and everyone came out on their deck.  My neighbor took pictures with his camera and then videotaped the incident.  Wild!  After a while, one of the 3 red lights would fade for a second or two, then reappear.  Eventually one of the red lights disappeared altogether and then about 2-3 minutes later, the 2 remaining red lights began to fade and then they disappeared completely.  There was no movement like you normally see from a plane and there was no sound at all like one would associate with a plane or helicopter.  This was in the Eastern Sky of Tinley Park.  We were located at 18000 and 80th Avenue in a subdivision of homes.  What a sight on Halloween night no less!;41.578732631579;-87.8132515789474
Red Lights again in Tinley Park, second sighting in two months;2004-10-31 20:00:00;20-30 min;Red Lights again in Tinley Park, second sighting in two months Three soundless red lights moved very slowly eastward, mostly in a boomarang formation.  They would shift formations occasionaly, and once or twice seemed to stop completly.  One of them seemed to be on point.  They were higher than most of the normal aircraft, but I am rather close to an airport.  It seemed a helicoptor was sent to check them out coming out of the south, but didnt really hang around or get too close to them.He just zipped north and then west. It also seemed a jet was after them from the north.  As the lights began to reach out further into the horizon the lead light sped forward, while one moved north and the other south. Then they just kinda twinkled out and were gone. Most of the event I captured on film along with many other local residents.  Over 200 calls were placed to local law enforcment.  This is the second occurence i know of in a 2 month span.;41.578732631579;-87.8132515789474
Slow moving red lights.;2004-10-31 20:00:00;30 minutes;Slow moving red lights. Three red lights moved slowly across the sky, staying in perfect formation. As they reached the southwest they changed formation into that of a triangle.  One dissappeared, then a second, and finally the third.;41.578732631579;-87.8132515789474

Three Red Lights Over Tinley Park;2005-10-01 01:00:00;20 minutes;Three Red Lights Over Tinley Park At around 1 am we witnessed three intense red lights move slowly across the night sky coming from the southwest and moving northeast. The lights seemed to all move individually but stayed in a similar shape. We noticed they had the same shape and placement as orions belt. Very similar. They stopped at about 40 degrees above the horizon east-northeast. They seemed to dim and start blinking, then one at a time disapeared. It took about 5 minutes to move across the sky and once they stopped they were visible to me for about 15 minutes.
