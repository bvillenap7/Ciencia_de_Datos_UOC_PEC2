series of exploding white, green, orange lights in NE area of Tinley Park within 5 mins;2004-12-12 19:00:00;5 minutes;series of exploding white, green, orange lights in NE area of Tinley Park within 5 mins Driving east on 191st st between 80th Ave & Harlem, we saw a series of bright flashes in the northeast sky. The first two flashes were white and the third time, it was bright green with a much wider distance and height, almost like an explosion in the sky. A minute or two later, the flashing started again as it headed south. There were about 5 smaller orange/red flashes. The whole experience was about 5 minutes. This was not lightning. The sky was a little overcast/cloudy, very windy  temperatures had recently dropped with light flurries.  This was cool! We're not crazy. We have been looking to the nighttime skies since fall after the numerous reports. Thinking back, during the summer, we (3 of us) saw a white light in the same area, but it was like a streak in the sky--not a plane.  We were surprised and all we could say was did you see that?  Tonight's experience, however, topped that.;41.578732631579;-87.8132515789474
