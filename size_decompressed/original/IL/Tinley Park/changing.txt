Went outside to observe 3 bright non blinking bright red lights formed in a triangle. Observed for about 10 minutes. The far right point of the triangle moved left and lined up below the center point. The far left point moved to the left. The center point and right point appeared to merge then fade out. The left point appeared to continue to move left then faded out. All movements were slow and non-blinking. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

red lights over tinley park, IL;2005-09-30 23:30:00;15-20 min;red lights over tinley park, IL After a homecoming game, me and my friends went to the super k-mart in tinley park. As we left we sat on the cars facing the store, just figureing out where to go when my friend asked if it was just her or where these lights moving. Sure enough 2 red lights above the store where moving. We where faceing the store and lookin in a south west postion and lookin as if a cellular tower becasue they where vertical. They then moved and eventually, about 5 to 10 minuates floated above us. The distance between them seemed to vary as they moved on. Very slowly seemed to expand and contract but not very noticable. I noticed they continued in a northwestern direction. The whole thing lasted around 15-20 minatues until we left. However as we left the lights where traveling in that northwestern postion. (NUFORC Note:  All reports of the two sightings (23:15 hrs., 30SE05, and 01:10 hrs., 01OC05) from Illinois will be passed along to Dr. Mark Rodighier, Director of the CENTER FOR UFO STUDIES, Chicago, as well as to Mr. Dave Marler, State Director of the MUTUAL UFO NETWORK for the State of Illinois, who will pass them along to his Field Investigators in the Chicago area.   We would be most grateful if witnesses to this event would please submit a detailed report of their sighting, using the ONLINE REPORT FORM on our website, and we will pass those reports along to those two investigators above.

Quick moving glowing orange object that changes shape according to the pics I took of it;2012-03-17 19:57:00;3 minutes;Quick moving glowing orange object that changes shape according to the pics I took of it 3/17/2012 7:57 PM Tinley Park, Illinois. Storm clouds in the south producing lightning, a glowing orange object comes out of the clouds heading northbound at fast rate of speed.  I was able to pull out my phone and click off 6 pics of object before it just faded and dissappeared into the northern sky. Pictures show shape shifting orange object. In one pic, if viewed on my phone, when zoomed in there appeares to be a defined cylindrical object surrounding the orange object.  It is a well defined 3 dimensional cylinder but it doesn't show up on my computer, only the phone.;41.578732631579;-87.8132515789474
