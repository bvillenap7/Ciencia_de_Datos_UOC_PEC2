Saw a disc shaped craft with 3 lights;1971-10-15 20:30:00;10-15 min;Saw a disc shaped craft with 3 lights. It was one evening around halloween when I was out taking a walk in the Brementowne Estates neighborhood where we lived at the time.  I was coming toward the pool when I noticed 3 lights above the pool that didn't look familiar to me.  I figured that when I got closer I would be able to see what they were.  As I kept getting closer they started moving off to the right.  I noticed that there were a lot of dogs barking very wildly at the time.  As it went off to the right it also began coming in my direction.  At this point all I saw were 3 lights because it was so dark out.  I started to walk into a field off to my right in order to get closer to it and it began to go off to toward me.  It was very low in the sky and I could see it lean toward me.  I was no more than about 200 feet from it.  As it leaned toward me I could see a disc schilloette(sp) around it.  I then got scared and stopped in my tracks.  It then slowly went back away from me and floated out of sight.  I went to the house of a girl I knew in the neighborhood and told her about the incident.  She said that about the same time their german shepard dog started barking very wildly for no apparent reason.  At the time I had been reading some UFO books and remembered that many times when a UFO was present, dogs would start barking wildly, possibly due to some ultra sound that humans could not hear and dogs could.;41.578732631579;-87.8132515789474
Low flying craft quickly moving across the sky with flashing red and white lights.;2008-07-02 23:20:00;4 minutes;Low flying craft quickly moving across the sky with flashing red and white lights. I saw a craft come down through the clouds moving from southwest to northeast. It was moving at a speed faster than a plane or helacopter. As I followed the craft across the sky I looked down for one second only to look up and see a second craft, exactly the same move quickly across the sky from northeast to southeast. There were white lights continually moving in a circular motion around the body of the craft with flashing red lights. I heard the sound of an airplane in the sky but it was present at the same decibel level for approximately 10 minutes. Typically airplane sounds come into audibility then fade as it gets farther away.;41.578732631579;-87.8132515789474
