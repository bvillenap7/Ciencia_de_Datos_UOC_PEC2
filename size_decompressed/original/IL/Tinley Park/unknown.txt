Thinking it was a plane i went back to talking but my friend alerted me they were moving. At that i ran and got my camera and tape and filmed the incident. The lights would form a straight line, then would move to a triangle shape, then move far aprt.  I also noticed that each light would blink or dim then others would follw.3 lights total.  When zoomedd in with my camera i noticed ligh shooting off from the red lights whitish in color.  I watched this take place over ten minutes.  The lights then perceded over my house then started to fade out one by one. ((NUFORC Note:  We believe the witness alludes to the dramatic sighting over Tinley Park, IL, on August 21, 2004.

3 Red Lights over Tinley Park, IL 8/21/04;2004-08-21 23:30:00;30 minutes;3 Red Lights over Tinley Park, IL 8/21/04 3 red pulsating lights observed in the southeast sky over TInley Park guessing they were over 171st St and Harlem Ave.? We are at 171st and 94th Ave. From our view they appeared one above the other with a third light further south. They slowly moved to form a perfect diagonal line, then one by one they just disappeared. We watched for about 20 - 30 minutes. Then, a few minutes later we saw one red light reappear and this time it only lasted a minute or so, then disappeared. Have read other reports and see many descriptions of the lights forming a triangle. I would guess these sitings are more directly underneath the lights than we were. The whole time they pulsated - getting brighter and softer. With binoculars they looked like lights with rays coming off the top and sides but that could be due to the binoculars. Who has video of this?? Did anyone see news reports?;41.578732631579;-87.8132515789474

3 laser red lights forming a triangle and at times a straight line traveled west to east slowly. after 20 minutes one disappeared.  Ano;2004-10-31 20:00:00;20 minutes;3 laser red lights forming a triangle and at times a straight line traveled west to east slowly. after 20 minutes one disappeared.  Ano We saw the lights over Tinley on August 21st so we have been looking alot more at the sky lately and have our phones programmed to call each other if it happened again.  Tonight it did just that.  Three bright (laser-like) lights coming from the west and traveling east at a slow rate of speed.  I received the call when they were directly over my house.  There was enough time for me to go out see them and then run back in and get my camera and binoculars and take some pictures and video as well.  The lights were initially in a straight line from my perspective and slowly transformed into a triangle.  They seemed to continue in a triangular pattern although their reletive positions changed throughout its eastward course. As I watched their eastward progression with binoculars the triangle seemed to have its peak pointed north and the base to the south.  The top south light seemed to move down quite quickly and become lower in the sky than the light that was initially lower than it.  It then disappeared and only 2 lights could be seen.  There was no sound.  I could not see any structure around or between the lights.  Because there were clouds and no stars visable, I could not tell if anything was visable through the triangle.  Just now I came back in the house. At 21:25 I received a call that another single light was coming from the west.  It could be seen due west above the house line moving on a course east northeast.  This single red light flew over the house and as it approached a 1:00 position it was lost in the clouds.  These clouds appear to be very high as there has been alot of air traffic seen this night and all planes visible.  This occurrence of a single red light traveling from the same direction as the previous 3 was the same situation that occurred August 21, 2004.;41.578732631579;-87.8132515789474

3 U.F.O.'s spotted in Chicago, IL.;2004-10-31 20:15:00;15 minutes;3 U.F.O.'s spotted in Chicago, IL. It was around 8:00 on Halloween night. My friend called me, told me the red lights he saw had returned (previuosly posted on this sight), so i looked out side and sure enough directly above my house was 3 very bright red lights. All 3 red lights at 1st ligned up in a str8 line with exact space inbetween each other. A few minutes later the farthest red light moved northbound and then formed an L formation with the other two lights. My mother then returned inside to get her camera, when she came back outside the 3 lights had moved alot farther southbound. Still in the L formation, allmost perhaps it was a Triangle formation. Actually it was alot like a triangle formation. We took 3 pictures but they did not turn out(her camera is just a normal digital camera). soon after we took the pictures the farthest east light disapeared, just vanished instantly. the other to started 2 seperate and soon after the farthest west light vanished. That 1 however seemed like it burnt out like a fire. it was flickering then gone. the last middle one disapered in the same fashion, but again in it's own path. this all happend in about 10 - 15 minutes. the lights at 1st were about button sized in the sky and ultra bright when they were first over my house. These were Most deffinantly not some sort of Laser Light's that some 1 put in the sky. These were most deffiantly not moving like airplanes and were most definantly way higher then helicopters can go.they also made absolutly NO sound.;41.578732631579;-87.8132515789474

Red Lights Seen Over Tinley Park;2004-10-31 21:30:00;30 minutes;Red Lights Seen Over Tinley Park I was taking out the garbage when I noticed three red lights in the sky in the shape of a triangle.  I immediately called for my daughters to come out and tell if I was really seeing these weird lights in the sky.  Sure enough, they saw the lights as well.  I called friends and family who also live in the area and they witnessed the lights also.  We stood outside watching them for about 30 minutes until they disappeared.  They moved slightly over the 30 minute period but stayed in a triangle formation. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));41.578732631579;-87.8132515789474
UFO red lights in sky over tinley park, very descriptive explanation.;2005-09-30 23:00:00;30 minutes;UFO red lights in sky over tinley park, very descriptive explanation. On September 30th at aproximately eleven o'clock I was delivering pizzas for my work when I had sighted a strange red light in the sky. I saw the previous red lights reported to nuforc on october 31st 2004, so I am always looking in the sky now for things like this.  I was driving south bound on 80th avenue and 167th street when I noticed the red light in the sky moving north east. I was driving my automobile so I could not sit and stare at it as much as I would ahve liekd to. Allthough as I was sitting at the stop light of 80th avenue and 167th street the red light movered directly over me and my automobile. It was over my head for about ten seconds, steadily moving, and making no sounds. i continued to deliver my pizza to the hotel I was driving to. I continued to stare every 1 seconds from the red light in the sky back to driving, because I wanted to see it, but had to hurry. I entered the hotel, delivered my pizza, and exited the hotel in a hurry to continue to watch it as I was then done with work.  When I came out of the hotel, a second red light apeared. the were moving at differant speeds, or differant directions because when I first saw the second red light it was about a 12 inches apart when looking in the sky. After a few minutes they lined up over each other, about 8 inches apart from each other. I raced home to show my girlfriend. She was home and we looked at them together from our home in tinley park.  By the time I got home the red lights were far east of tinley park, but still very visable. We watched them move farther and fartehr away from us for about ten minutes before they ultimately burnt out in the night sky.  the whole insident was about 30 minutes I would say. I would like to add again that me, my mother, my brother saw the last 3 red lights on october 31st of 2004 reported by many others to nuforc as well.  My mother is a working class 9 - 5 tax paying citizen, my brother is a college graduate working in the news business, I am a attending college student, and my Girlfriend is an attending college student. We are all very normal poeple, no history of any psychotic behavior or any visits with phsyciatrist. none of us have ever seen any thing like these red lights before in our lifes.  The only differances with these red lights and the ones from october 31st last year, is there was only 2 this time, and these seemed smaller to me in my memory, and last these didnt move around as much as last years did. last years seemed like they formed flight patterns, as these kinda just floated over our heads.  If I ever see these again i'm going to use my video camera on them.

2 red lights moving west to east;2005-09-30 23:15:00;15 minutes;2 red lights moving west to east 2 red lights in the northern sky, moving west to east very slowly, nearly hovering at certain points.  Similar movement to those seen on October of 2004, but 2 instead of 3 red lights.  Moved completely symmetrical to each other as if attached by something.  Also noted that for their visual duration, there were no other aircraft in the sky.  I watch the planes going into Midway every night from my bedroom window and as soon as I saw the red lights, there were no other planes in the sky.  The event lasted approx. 15 minutes, shortly after which the usual air traffic returned.

Strange glowing redish orange light hovering over 88th Avenue in Tinley Park, IL;2005-10-22 21:30:00;15 minutes;Strange glowing redish orange light hovering over 88th Avenue in Tinley Park, IL After reading an article in the local Tinley Park newspaper and viewing an NBC Dateline TV story on UFO's, I have decided to report an incident that I also witnessed in Tinley Park.   I live in Tinley Park in the vicinity of 173rd and 88th Ave.  My house and the glass patio doors face 88th Ave.  While watching a Chicago White Sox world series game back in October, 2005,  I noticed a dull and pulsating redish orange glowing light coming in through the glass patio doors.  At first I thought it might be a police car giving someone a traffic ticket or a fire truck that parked on the street, but I heard no sound, it was quit eerie   After about 6 minutes or so I looked out the patio doors, but could not see any police car or fire truck, and the light was still there and seemed to cover the entire block.  The light pulsated slowly and the view of the street seemed a little misty or foggy.   I next heard a low sounding buzzing or humming and about one minute later the light was gone.  It did appear that the light was moving very slowly to the southwest before it vanished. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I was taking a picture of one with my iphone, I did get 4 shots as the vehicle got close overhead, suddenly my camera stopped working.  The close vehicle overhead had 4 lights I know red, white and green I think,  The fourth I’m not sure as I told my partner it made the vehicle look square.  It looked like an invasion as there were so many!  If it was aircraft what on earth were they doing? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
