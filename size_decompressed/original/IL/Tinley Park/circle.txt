I saw this object, which I believe to be a weather balloon, or an advertising balloon, appear to be climbing, and went almost due south. My wife obsevered this ufo too. I just hope if it is an advertising balloon, that the wire that keeps it on the ground snapped off at the right end, otherwise it is a danger to any aircraft.;41.578732631579;-87.8132515789474

I also notified the Oak Forest police and they had no information or any other calls about it. I also called news radio 780 WBBM and told them what I was seeing.

Creepy, Peculiar, Red Dots;2004-10-31 22:00:00;20 Min.;Creepy, Peculiar, Red Dots Well, it was on Halloween night in 2004 and me and my friends just got done trick or treating and as we got back to my friends house, everyone started to point at the sky, it look as if 3 red dots in the sky were in the formation of a triangle.  So my buddies dad got his video camera and started to record this incident. This lasted for about 20 minutes. The 3 red dots just moved over the sky and finally after the 20 minutes one by one they started to go out, like a lightbulb going bad.  That was the last time I saw it.  But every now and then we look at that video that was recorded.   If anyone has any information on what this is, please tell.  Thanks;41.578732631579;-87.8132515789474

The 3 red lights of south chicago;2005-09-30 23:30:00;hour;The 3 red lights of south chicago My three friends and myself were at the Tinley Park Pub and Eatery late Friday night.  I went outside to call a friend and noticed the three red lights.  They were definatley way to high to be a helo, and too quiet and too still to be an aircraft (a jet turbine requires far too much inlet pressure, and these objects were moving relatively slow, too slow to power a jet turbine).  While I first started watching the lights, I noticed an airplane flying through the area, I first thought the lights would react to the plane, but they just kept moving very slowly.  The airplane flew over me in about thirty seconds, the 3 lights remained.  I got my friends outside of the bar to see them.  They slowly circled each other, 3 red glowing balls, slowly getting brighter, then dimming themselves out.  They had moved from a staggered line formation (when I first saw them) to a broken triangle formation.  After my friends were watching for about fifteen minutes, the top one on the triangle did its normal, bright then dim out routine, but after it dimmed it never returned.  The remaining two lights moved very slowly around each other.  After I had seen them we were deductively going through possibilities of why they were getting dim and brighter.  My one friend suggested cloud cover, but the sky was completely clear.  My parents had contacted me via my cell phone, and informed me they we watching the lights as well.  Now from where I was standing, they looked very far in the distance and to the north.  My father had informed me that they were very close over the golf course next to our house (george w dunne. forest preserve course/yankee woods) and insisted that they were withing the atmosphere, therefore ruling out a possibility of satellites.  I went back into the pub after watching the lights for close to an hour with my friends.  When we all were leaving the pub, they were no longer in the sky.

During the first sighting i was driving...i asked my friends what the hell was in the sky. It was two red lights floating all crazy up in the sky...eventually they rose and were in order...like a line. They moved towards a 3rd light already high in the sky. These red lights pulsated and moved very quick up in the sky. They made absolutely no noise.  Then 3 hours later...they soon returned.  This time all 3 rose from about 100ft away and pretty low...they moved in a line and almost mocked star constellations at some points...eventually they formed a triangle high in the sky and disappeared...it was ridiculous.  We tried to look at it with a telescope but we couldn't find it...we do have pictures and video though!
