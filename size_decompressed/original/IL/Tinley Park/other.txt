At an outdoor  concert at the World Music Theater, a friend and I witnessed a sheild shaped aircraft that moved at termendous speed from the westen horizon tot the eatern horizon in about 15 to 20 seconds. The craft had a dull orange/redish glow. There was other normal air traffic in the area.;41.578732631579;-87.8132515789474
3 Bright Red Objects in South Eastern Sky that took different formations then disappeared.;2004-10-31 20:00:00;1/2 hour;3 Bright Red Objects in South Eastern Sky that took different formations then disappeared. 3 bright red lights in sky.  Looked like three red stars.  Took Triangle formation, then L shape formation than a 90 degree formation.  Red Star to the left drifted off to the left and then the remaining two seemed to back off into space and disappear. Sighting lasted about 20 min to half hour.;41.578732631579;-87.8132515789474
3 orange lights in the sky over Tinley Park.;2004-10-31 20:00:00;30 minutes (approx);3 orange lights in the sky over Tinley Park. At first they just hovered where they were but then they started to move slowly. I didn't watch from the beginning and I wasn't able to watch in its entirety, but i saw them move around in seemingly random directions very slowly but steadily. I went back outside a little late and found only one light. The original three were in the Eastern sky around 8 PM, and the single light was in the Southern sky around half an hour later. As I watched the single light in the South, it started to move, slowly at first but picked up speed and went back to where the original three had been and then disappeared. I had about ten or eleven other people with me and some of them took pictures and maybe videos of it. There was no sound associated with the objects whatsoever. They seemed to be very far away but were still intensely bright. No craft could be seen, only individual lights. The lights glowed orange and seemed to pulsate slightly, although this may have been an optical illusion. When I looked into this event I found similar reports from other dates that mentioned red lights. Although the reports seem to identify the same lights, the ones I witnessed were distinctly orange. These orange lights seem very convenient for Halloween, and may be a hoax. However, I cannot deny what I saw with my own eyes.;41.578732631579;-87.8132515789474

From about 45 degrees south way higher than airplanes can fly, about satellite altitude this white light that looked like a satellite came out of no where and moved so fast north it could not have been a satellite.  From south 45degrees to north 45degrees in about 7 seconds. I have never seen anything move that fast before. No tail, just a white light about the size of a star moving at incredible speeds. If I where to guess, probably about 3 to 4000 miles an hour.  I have seen satellites plenty of times before and this thing was like a corvette compared to a bicycle. This was 1 yeard to the day i think of a cigar shaped craft seen over Tinley and Oakforest at around 2pm in the afternoon.  I have been working with a UFO investigator and explained this one to him, there is no explanation on the speed, maybe shuttle?  Their planned route was not over N. American last night, and I don't even think that the shuttle has that type of speed without thrusters involved that would be dictated by a trail of some sort.;41.578732631579;-87.8132515789474
Strange contrail below low cloud cover;2009-10-06 09:00:00;Contrail;Strange contrail below low cloud cover One other witness and I noticed large contrail below low cloud cover. We had never seen this before. Contrail extended across the sky and was blowing away rapidly due to high winds as a trail of smoke from a bottle rocket would dissipate. Weather was rainy. Event described as odd. I have only seen these on clear days until this event.;41.578732631579;-87.8132515789474
