3 Red Lights over Tinley Park, IL;2004-10-31 19:30:00;25 minutes;3 Red Lights over Tinley Park, IL Around 7:30pm we noticed 3 very bright red lights in the northern sky over Tinley Park.  The lights were in various formations changing from triangular shapes to a straight line.  They did not move very fast but rather moved with purpose.  We were able to caputure the lights on a video camera as well as observing them through binoculars.  Through the binoculars they were all the same shape and color an oblong shape with crater-like indentations on the body of the object.  The lights moved into the eastern sky very slowly, again changing formations.  After about 25 minutes the first light faded away and the other two faded as well.;41.578732631579;-87.8132515789474

He told me to look and i glanced and WOW, cigar shaped, moving slowly south towards I-80.   I did have binoculars in the car and told my son to find it through them.  He replied, it has no wings.  When he went to pass the binoculars to his brother so he could see - it was gone.  My sons and I have witnessed the 21st of August 2004, October 31st 2004.  But we never expected to see one during the afternoon hours. This has somewhat become a common occurance for Tinley Park. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.
