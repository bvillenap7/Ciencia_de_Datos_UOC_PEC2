I was at Forest View Farms in Tinley Park/Oak Forest when three red lights started to move slowly around the area, and then disappered.  One of my friends called my cell phone and told me to look in the sky at the three red circular lights that were sort of floating.  She said they were UFOs.  I stood there staring at them and then the one at the back of the 1/2 circle shape they made faded and disappered.  The rest of them disappered soon after the first.;41.578732631579;-87.8132515789474
3 motionless red spheres of light;2004-10-31 20:15:00;10 minutes;3 motionless red spheres of light Witnessed three balls of red light in the southeasterly direction in the sky.  Myself, my wife and neighbors all stood outside and watched theses red balls of light sitting motionless in the sky in a triangular shape.  For a period of 10 minutes they stood motionless and then they slowly moved in an easterly direction in a similar formation until the lights were no longer able to be seen. Through a zoom lens, they looked like red spheres of light.  They did not blink and they did not make any noise.;41.578732631579;-87.8132515789474

I saw the red orb come over the tree in my back yard, I said that is the ufo again, I have seen them before.  This time there was just one and it was suddenly coming right up over us and we were both looking up at it.  Then the light went out and I could see the actual craft hovering there and it looked just like a flying saucer out of the movies.  We both watched it move east towards the High school and for another 20 sec. then it shot off. No noise no sounds, there was a low flying plane above it flying south.  Yes it was a very surreal experience. hard to grasp what you are seeing.  It is absolutely proof to me that something is out there checking on us but for what I do not know.;41.578732631579;-87.8132515789474
