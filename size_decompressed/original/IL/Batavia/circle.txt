Three silent orange low flying lights circled for 15 minutes.;2018-09-23 20:45:00;15 minutes;Three silent orange low flying lights circled for 15 minutes. At about 8:45 p.m. Central time my wife arrived home after orchestra practice exclaiming to me that there were strange lights in the sky circling above our part of town.  I quickly went outside to see what she was talking about.  We saw three distinct orange lights circle about three times.  From beginning to end the event lasted no more than 15 minutes. 	They were flying low and silently.  The fact they were orange peaked my interest because that is not the color of regulation aircraft lighting.  The whole night struck me as odd because two hours earlier while coming home from picking up a pizza for dinner I saw three stationary white lights in the eastern sky near the moon.  I assumed they were news helicopters, but now I am not so sure.;41.8484589285714;-88.3074160714285
