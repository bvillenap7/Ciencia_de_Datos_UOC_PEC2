4 object in daylight;2003-11-09 14:00:00;5 minutes;4 object in daylight I walked out of a store on Randall road in Batavia, IL.  I saw 3 objets flying in a circle.  My first reaction was to think they were birds.  I quickly realized that was not the case.  They were much too high to be birds and at that altitude, birds could not be seen.  They were moving in a counter-clockwise rotation in a circle and silver in color.  Their path was not perfect or even eliptical.  They moved in an erratic motion going closer and farther from the center of the circle.  One moved away from the rest to the West and then disappeared.  The second one did the same.  The third one moved in the same direction, but went much slower and slowly faded out.  About 30 second later another object appeared to be the size of the first 3 put together.  It was silver at the top and went to bronze at the bottom.  It stayed stationary for 30 seconds and then went straight up at a high rate of speed and disappeared.  We did notice military jet in the area.  I couldn't tell what they were doing.;41.8484589285714;-88.3074160714285
sphere in sky.;2010-06-26 15:22:00;5 minutes;sphere in sky. Hello, I just talked with you about Batavia Il, Ufo sighting.   Called FAA and got cloud ceiling 7000 ft broken and some at 3500 ft.  Cloud with sphere would be at 3500 ft, cloud with two holes at 7000 ft.  Also I live a few miles from Fermi Lab.;41.8484589285714;-88.3074160714285
Orb sited under cloud,disappears, then a minute later see it falling out of the sky like a metorite, jet chasing it.;2010-06-26 15:22:00;5 min;Orb sited under cloud,disappears, then a minute later see it falling out of the sky like a metorite, jet chasing it. On 06/26/10 at 15:22 hrs, I observed a ufo. I was laying out at the pool, with friends, I was looking at the clouds, wondering if it was going to rain, patchy cloud cover,with a giant clear blue sky in center of clouds.  I noticed one cloud had to holes in it, and could see sky through them, as I went from cloud to cloud just looking at how wonerful the sky was.  I noticed a brown comtrail heading east,that was well above the clouds, I followed the comtrail to another cloud, and as my eye met that cloud an Orb appeared from nowhere under the clouds, it was grey and spherical in shape it was moving west at a speed of an airliner, it seem to spin and catch the sun it went from dull grey to shinny metalic,with a gold like rim on the forward front of sphere,then it became pure white, it blinked one time a larger whitness, then I thought to myself it see's me,maybe 5 seconds I saw it, it traveled apx 1 mile, and just then it disappeared into the pure blue sky. Well I told my friend sitting next to me I just saw a ufo, he said yeah right, well as he was cracking jokes, I kept looking up to the sky, about 1 minute latter in the open blue sky, away from all the clouds, what now appears to be a metorite stars to fall towards earth,apx 100,000 ft, I yell to my friend thats no jet, and he yelled hell no, it's moving way to fast. It was a pure white short comtrail, I noticed a redish point small like a pixtel, as we watch it free fall, it turned off the comtrail for a second then back on, leaving a dash in the sky, it's comtrail maybe a mile long, I thought maybe it's a metorite, but it leveled off and went west, 50000 ft, about a minute later, as were watching, a jet flying so high and fast had same brown color comtrail as I observed earlier,now was chasing after this object,west, but the object had to be 50 miles if not more ahead of him. I watched ufo until I could no longer see tail, it faded into the blue sky, but I would guess it w! as in Iowa by then.The comtrail from jet was 10miles long,but this orb, its tail was very short and pure white. I know what I saw, I am self taugh in many things, I have studied ufo's and never, ever wanted to see one.  I am reporting this because it's my duty as an American citizen, I swear to what I am saying to be true.;41.8484589285714;-88.3074160714285

Shiny sphere following a plane turned 180 degrees, and vanished into the sky!;2014-09-16 19:00:00;1 minute;Shiny sphere following a plane turned 180o and vanished into the sky! I was leaving the house with my wife to go grab a bite to eat. We were driving out on my street going East. The sky was completely clear and blue. Sunset had started and I was looking at the sky admiring the scenery.  The sun light coming from the west was shining bright when reflected by planes cruising at very high altitude.  I saw at least 6 planes cruising at very high altitude, probably 30k to 36k feet, following two routes patrern from east to west.  Every single one of the planes had very visible chemtrails. Then I realized there was a extremely bright esphere by one of the airplanes. It stroke me as odd, because it was too early yet for stars to appear in the sky.  I told my wife to look at it, and we both realized that the brightness of the object was coming from the reflection of the sun light.  It was definitely metalic and reflecting the sun light.  But how could that be?  The object was in the form of a large esphere, about 2 to 3 times the size of the airplane nearby it. It was crusing along the airplane.  About the same altitude and same speed.  No chemtrail whatsoever!  We realized then that we could be looking at a UFO!  We were very skeptical at first.  But then the object which seemed to be following the airplane, turned to the opposite side, and start accelerating eastward.  The speed in which it was going was about 10 times the speed of the planes.  Then It just went straight up and the bright faded until it was gone out of sight, which took about 3 to 5 seconds!  We could tel! it was going up, because it was not going in the direction of the horizon. That was it.  My wife and I looked at each other almost not believing what just had happened!;41.8484589285714;-88.3074160714285
