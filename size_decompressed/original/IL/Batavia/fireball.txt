We both saw a VERY large object, as big as the moon, almost walnut-like in appearance because it looked very crumpled and mangled, falling through the sky about a mile away from out house. It was radiating a red and orange and yellow glow around it, like fire and flames I figured, because it left a long trail of dark grey smoke behind it. Me and my mom just watched it for a minute or two thinking Holy ((deleted)) to ourselves, and it just kind of silently faded out of view. There wern't that many clouds out, so it didnt just disappear behind clouds...it just faded from view. It wasnt falling AWAY from us either, just almost straight across the sky, traveling down at MAYBE a 10 degree angle. Afterwards, we drove down to the area where we thought it mightve been (no forests or fields or anything, all suburbs) but we didnt find a thing, and I called a few of my friends the next morning, but none of them had seen a thing.
