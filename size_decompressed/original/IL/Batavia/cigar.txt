Three lights, arranged in such as manner as to portray a submarine, only in my field of view for about 30 sec.  ((anonymous report));2019-03-16 09:10:00;<1 minute;Three lights, arranged in such as manner as to portray a submarine, only in my field of view for about thirty seconds or less,real big. I was video chatting with my friend, when I heard this strange, low rumble.  Kind of like a toned-down jet sound.  I looked out my window and happened to touch my window, and it was vibrating softly. I didn't see much, considering it was nighttime, but I saw three green lights,  I believe they were all green.  The thing was much too large to be a helicopter and wasn't a plane, I don't think,  if I didn't know better I'd say it was a giant flying submarine.  There was one light in front, one in the middle a little higher up than the others, and one in the back.  It seemed to be headed southeasterly from where I live.
