She first thought it might be a shooting star, but it was moving horizontal instead of vertical.  It was too low to be a plane and she didn't think it was one at all. It was consistantly in motion.  It streaked across to catch a glimpse and then just vanished out of sight. The whole sighting was appoximately 1 to 2 seconds. She was out on her deck by a pool at night.  She happened look up in the night sky and saw the irredescent green shape.  Temperature was normal for this time of year.  Humidity was low. Sky was clear. The shape was frisbee like.  Possessed no characteristics of a airplane.;37.7655;-89.3316
Cylindrical object, 4-5x wider than long travelling west to east at high altitude with no navigational or strobe lights;2006-08-17 21:38:00;~30 seconds;Cylindrical object, 4-5x wider than long travelling west to east at high altitude with no navigational or strobe lights A friend and I were fishing at the lake on a nice summer evening with fairly clear skies and a beautiful view of the Milky Way...at 9:38 pm Central time, we saw a dim object pass overhead at high altitude, travelling from west to east, the object appeared 4-5 times as wide as it was long, there were absolutely no strobe or navigation lights on the craft, it's magnitude of brightness was comparable to the stars.  We observed this for about 30 seconds before losing sight of it far to the east of where we were (there's more light pollution to the east, although we weren't certain whether our 'losing' the object was because of the light pollution or overhead haze and moisture (So. Illinois is quite humid in the summertime.);37.7655;-89.3316
