It looked as though it appeared out of nowhere and then traveled behind a building, where it could no longer be seen, even though observer made an attempt to follow the object. The object was at an elevation of roughly 10,000 feet, much lower than a commercial jet. The object was rectangular and divided into three sections, with the center being a larger section. It had a gray translucent first section, a transparent middle section and a gray translucent end section. It was only visible because it was darker than its surroundings and the gray sections were visible. No lights were visible. Gray sections were visible against the starry sky. Observer is a 23 year old male college graduate working for local government, including firefighting, emergency management and IT.;37.7655;-89.3316
