We were driving through the Shawnee National Forest heading North. The sky was moonless and pitch black as we drove through the Forrest.  Suddenly a brilliant white light appeared ahead of us high above the road.  It was like some one had opened a door in the middle of a black sky.   After a couple of seconds a glowing red orb began to slowly float down out of the light towards the tree line then another red orb appeared slightly to the right and also floated down at the same speed as the other orb. Both orbs floated down behind the tree line.  As soon as we saw the orbs enter the forrest the brilliant white light just dissapeared...like someone turned off a light switch.   We were really spooked by this and sped up to get out of the forest as soon as possible.;37.7655;-89.3316
