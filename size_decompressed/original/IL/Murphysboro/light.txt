I saw a beam of light hit the ground,about 1 foot wide;1982-09-13 21:00:00;30+ minutes;I saw a beam of light hit the ground,about 1 foot wide I lived just outside of town and behind my house was a corn field that had been harvested.About 200 yards was the tree row that runs along the river,for a long stretch on both sides. I have been back there fishing many of times and know the area well. The Big Muddy is not very wide, at that spot not no more than 100 feet.I was getting in my car when I saw a green light and a red light moving slowly in the trees.I got out and started walking towards them.The lights started coming up river, closer towards me.They were going up and down below tree level.I was laying in a shallow ditch right at the trees,no farther than 50 yards from the river.The lights seemed to be a good distance apart. I never did see a shape.About half way through my sighting,I saw a beam of light,no more than a foot across,searching through the woods.I could see it hitting the ground.I watched for several minutes and it hit me how scared I was.There was not a sound at all.The object started moving down river and I got the hell back to my car.I watched it for several more minutes there when it came above the trees and shot off into the night sky.I know what I saw and I hope they are friendly.It seemed like hours,but the whole thing lasted for over 30 minutes.Been looking up ever since.

Pinkish light zig zags in sky.;2012-01-15 21:24:00;15 sec;Pinkish light zig zags in sky. I was walking my dog last night and looked up in the sky as I usually do at night to view the stars.  When I looked in the South East sky I saw what appeared to be a star moving in my direction. After about 5 seconds it immediately stopped for about 3 seconds and made a sharp right turn very quickly.  It appeared to go several miles in just a couple of seconds and stopped again for a few seconds, made a left turn then zipped off to the east at a very high rate of speed. It was a pinkish light and seemed to be in space and not our atmosphere and about the size of a star. I called the local authorities however they were not interested.;37.7655;-89.3316
Bright ball of light seen above the horizon line, zoomed away quicker than possible.;2016-07-16 23:00:00;30 seconds;Bright ball of light seen above the horizon line, zoomed away quicker than possible. Driving home at night, I witnessed a bright ball of light hovering above the horizon line.  The light was absurdly bright, and I didn't notice it until I did a double take and saw the light.  It was no more than 15 feet in diameter and seemed perfectly spherical. After observing the light for a couple seconds, it tracked backward and away at an inconceivable pace.;37.7655;-89.3316
