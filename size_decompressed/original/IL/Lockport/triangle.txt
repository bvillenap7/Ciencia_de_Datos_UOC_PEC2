Triangular  Object;2010-03-05 23:00:00;3 hours;Triangular  Object I was taking my dog out for the night and it was very clear out. I noticed what I thought were plane lights untinl I saw a beam of green light come from it and it was not moving.  I came in the house and told my mom and son to come outside.  My sister called and I told her about it and she came over and we watched it for a good 45min and I watched it my self about 45 min.  We looked through binoculars and could see differnt colored lights on it.  After we watched for awhile we notice 3 more.  The one we were watching started moving out towards the Cresthill Joliet area. My  son and I decided to go and seen where it was going. We whent down rt.53 to Division St. and we could see this very very bright light.  We crossed over Weber Rd. the closer we got to it the brighter the light got it was almost blinding. We crossed over Gaylord Rd. and we were by a warehouse, I turned down the street and stopped so we could see this thing. My son and I could see the bottom of ! it it hovered above us.  It ws triangle shaped it had red large circulat lights on the botom and you could see all of these colored lights around it. I have never seen any thing like it in my life, I also had the window down so I could get a picture of it and I also did not hear any sound from it. As quickly as I took the picture it took off.  I have seen more of them around here for the last several days and I did take a video and some pictures.;41.5909999999999;-88.0483999999999
