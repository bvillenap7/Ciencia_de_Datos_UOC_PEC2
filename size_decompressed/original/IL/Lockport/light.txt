3 lights chasing or following each other. Speeding up, slowing down, turning 90 degrees in an instant.;1970-07-01 23:30:00;1 minute;3 lights chasing or following each other. Speeding up, slowing down, turning 90 degrees in an instant. We were coming home from a drive-in around 23:30 and there were alot of stars in the sky. I was 8 years old at the time but this has always stuck with me. I got out of the car and looked up at the stars when I noticed 1 light shooting across the sky from east to west very quickly then 2 other ones came up behind it like they were following the first. Back then I thought they were maybe playing tag. I asked my mom and dad what that was and they looked in awe then said probably a shooting star. But they kept watching. The first one slowed down made a sharp 90 degree turn very quickly to the south for about 1 or 2 seconds then made another 90 degree turn very quickly to the west. The other 2 lights chasing it did exactly the same thing. Like making the exact same movements as the first one by slowing down, speeding up and making the very sharp and quick turns. When all 3 were going west again they sped up and disappeared. Like someone shut off their light. They just had 1 bright light. I think this sighting stayed with me all these years because of how my parents just froze when they were watching them.;41.5909999999999;-88.0483999999999
Bright Lights in SW suburbs of Chicago;2009-12-01 20:30:00;20 mins;Bright Lights in SW suburbs of Chicago Saw a bright large light up in the sky, then it appeared to be 2 other lights (looked like normal airline flashing lights) near it at first.   After watching it for a little while there appeared to be 5 or 6 of the airplanes around it.  All with flashing red & white lights.  Bright large light disappeared and reappeared about 2 miles away towards Mokena/New Lenox area. When I stopped to look into the sky again I saw the flashing what looked like airplanes all over the sky.  When one appeared to be close to the ground, I stopped to see if I could hear anything and it passed overhead without any noise.;41.5909999999999;-88.0483999999999
