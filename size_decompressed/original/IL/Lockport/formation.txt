I have seen the starlink satellites before and these were much brighter and low in the sky below the clouds. It almost looked like a straight line of lights with a very small space imbetween like a straight line of lights lower than an airplane would fly. When I turned at the intersection I tried to look back and I couldn't see them anymore.;41.5909999999999;-88.0483999999999
