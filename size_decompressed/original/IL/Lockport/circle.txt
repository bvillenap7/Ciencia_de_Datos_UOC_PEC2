Multicolored large, bright  object  in Southeast sky over Lockport, IL.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probably the star, Sirius, we suspect.  PD);2005-12-19 09:45:00;hours;Multicolored large, bright  object  in Southeast sky over Lockport Illinois. There was a object hovering in the Southeast sky on Monday Dec 19 2005 over Lockport IL.   It was higher then an airplane but lower then stars.  It was quite large in relation to stars or planes.  It flashed blue, green, and white.   On the zoom lense of my video camera it looked like a ball of energy--with a center core of white light. (Like the toy they sell at the mall--the sphere where if you put your hand on it all of the light goes to your fingers).   We have hours of video tape and could not stop watching this mystery.   That night we also saw several red pin sized dots all over the sky.   We called the police and they could not explain what it was.   I would like to know what this is!;41.5909999999999;-88.0483999999999

Blue and red steady object.;2014-08-08 23:30:00;2 minutes;Blue and red steady object As I drove off I-355, I noticed a blue and red steady light in the sky going pretty fast forward then backwards.   I turned around to check it out and took a video.  In the video the lights turn off and then on and zips around  in every direction.  While taking a second video, I was watching my screen when I couldn't find it, I looked out of my windshield to find it hovering in one spot, facing me and then flashed its lights.  I saw three red dots in the form of a triangle on the bottom and blue around the outside.   I was so physically shaken, I had to leave.   Never saw anything like this before.;41.5909999999999;-88.0483999999999
