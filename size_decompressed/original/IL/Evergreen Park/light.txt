In the southeast area of the sky there were 3 red lights hovering high in the sky over the horizon.   This was at about 1:10 AM at about 1:30 they began to fade away, and then disappeared.  This morning at work, I was listening to wbbm on my break.  A report came on, they said dozens of people called the police and news talking about these lights.  The same thing happened last year 8-21-04 and on 10-31-04.   No one knows what they were.   As of yet they remain unidentified.  Strange Eh?  Here is a link to the news report.

Two red lights sitting in the sky, but I couldn't not make out an object.;2005-10-01 01:08:00;8 minutes;Two red lights sitting in the sky, but I couldn't not make out an object. My brother called to tell me, at 1:07 AM, that there were two strange red lights in the sky.  This seemed to be worth getting up for, especially since I was watching Casino on the Bravo network.   My brother is located in Oak Forest approximately 20 minuted from where I am in Evergreen Park.  Oak Forest, being farther from Chicago has alot less light pollution.   But when I walked outside, the first thing I noticed was all of the celestial objects I could observe when I look up 75-90  degrees in the sky.   However, I was not outside to stare at Ursa Minor and Venus I was looking for red lights.   I asked my brother where the lights were, he did a bad job describing where they were so I just looked toward his apartment (South) and then turned my head away from the apartment (east).   I then saw what he was talking about, two red lights just sitting in the sky at a 45 degree angle from my vantage point, no movement at all.  It took me about 5 secs to come to the conclusion that I could not create a rational explanation for what the lights were.   My heart fell into my stomach and my feet toward my house I knew I had to get my digital camera.  I was back outside in about a minute.  I tried to take a picture but the battery in the camera was drained of power because it has to sit in the charger not the camera and has been in the camera for about two weeks.   I observed the object for maybe two more minutes before it just faded.  I have never seen anything like this, I could rule out the following as explanations: helicopter (never heard of a silent helicopter), satellite (satellites actually move).  It was not a plasma flare because these were lights on an object.   Was it an airplane?  No, it was not because of the same reason it was not a satellite, they actually move.  I don't think anyone uses weather balloons anymore.

Light-filled balloon-like objects [15-25]in the eastern sky drifted northward for about 3min.,stopped for 1min, then disappeared.;2011-10-22 19:50:00;4min;Light-filled balloon-like objects [15-25]in the eastern sky drifted northward for about 3min.,stopped for 1min, then disappeared. These round objects of light were observed in the eastern sky at approximately a 45 degee angle from the horizon.  There were about 15-25 of them. They were moving slowly in a nothernly direction.  They seemed to be in a random pattern, and appeared to be almost drifting in the sky like light-filled balloons. They were moving slowly from south to north.  They were not falling.  They seemed to stop for approximately one minute and then they suddenly disappeared. They were larger than a star would be, but much smaller than the moon.;41.7212;-87.7037
