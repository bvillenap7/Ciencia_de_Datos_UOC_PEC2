At about 9:30pm I stepped outside to put a cake in the fridge- a bright yellowish/red light in the southern sky caught my eye.   I yelled for my step-daughter to come outside and look.  She then yelled for her father to come look also.  Seconds after he came outside it started to flicker until it completely burned out.  It wasn't moving across the sky like a normal meteor.  It stayed on the same path headed sought until it had disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));39.7224;-88.6446
