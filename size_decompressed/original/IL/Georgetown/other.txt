They were  about the same size of a small engine airplane;1999-06-01 14:00:00;10 min.;They were  about the same size of a small engine airplane During a time in the afternoon after a stormy period I was outside looking at the clouds when I seen what appeared to be a large silver ballon above and in the clouds. Thinking it was a weather ballon I thought nothing of it. Suddenly there started appearing many more of the same obects going in the same direction. I then started thinking it could be someone turned loose a bunch of large ballons for some reason. I called for my wife to bring the binoculars out and she did. I could see no distinquishing marks on them but they were going in the same direction at the same speed, about 150 -200 miles per hour. This went on about 10 to 15 min. My wife also abserved the incident. We never could find out the cause of this. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.
