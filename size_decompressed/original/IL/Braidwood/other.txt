Bright orange light/Dome- or Bulb-Shaped Craft.;2016-05-29 21:00:00;1 minute;Bright orange light/Dome- or Bulb-Shaped Craft. I was on my deck saw a super bright orange light high in the sky approaching, at a pretty fast speed, no sound.  Ran and grabbed my high powered binoculars.  Observed with binoculars the super bright orange light (which looked like a torch), emanating from the Center, base of the object, possibly within it.  The light provided an outline of the object against the sky, looked either iridescent (reflection on metal?) or see through like a jelly fish.  The object traveled West to East and was out of site in less than a minute.  There was no time to take a picture and a picture would have only captured the super bright orange light.   I am surprised that no one else saw/reported this.;41.266;-88.2191
