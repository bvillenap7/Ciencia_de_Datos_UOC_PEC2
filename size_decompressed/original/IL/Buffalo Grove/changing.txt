4 large circular lights moving in the same pattern from the center to 4 corners.  ((NUFORC Note:  Advertising lights?  PD));2012-09-08 00:00:00;unknown;4 large circular lights moving over and over in the same pattern from the center to four corners My wife and I viewed four white lights in the sky above Buffalo Grove ill.  9-8-19 around midnight.  They moved from four corners and floated to a center then went back out where they started. They maybe covered a mile or so.  Itâ€™s hard to judge distance. They are white against the rain clouds.  When lights like this are seen you can trace them to the ground like a promotion drawing you to a location.  None of them showed that they came from the ground up.   They were moving in the same pattern with no variation.;42.1614;-87.9660000000001
