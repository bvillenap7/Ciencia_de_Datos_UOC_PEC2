All of a sudden I looked out my window and saw a light making a circular motion. It was a smaller circle and then grew to a bigger circle of light. When the clouds cleared I saw a circular disk. It moved around.  Am I crazy?  Well, anyway I went to get my camera and it was gone.  No lights no disk.;42.1614;-87.9660000000001
