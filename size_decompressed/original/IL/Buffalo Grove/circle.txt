Circular object with multiple lights arround the outside and hovering noise coming from it.;2016-05-06 23:30:00;1 minute;Circular object with multiple lights arround the outside and hovering noise coming from it. It was dark outside, no clouds and then all of a sudden as we were sitting in his my friend's backyard a flying object in the distance appeared.   First, the immediate thought was a plane, but this object had multiple colors that a plane does not have.  White, green, some blue, and some red.  It was flying a lot lower than an airplane would.   As we ran to the street for a better view, we saw this object had a circular shape and we were 100% sure.  Listening closely, there was a noise coming from it (low whistling noise only heard when silent).   Was moving very slowly and eventually we lost track of it, but not before getting a clear view of it being a complete circle shape which automatically eliminates the possibility of it being a plane.;42.1614;-87.9660000000001
