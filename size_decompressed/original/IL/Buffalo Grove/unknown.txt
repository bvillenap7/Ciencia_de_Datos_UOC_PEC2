4 red lights on object in southeast night sky object descended.;2007-07-21 22:00:00;5 minutes;4 red lights on object in southeast night sky object descended. We could not see the size or shape of the object what we did see was a red light moving very slowly in the sky to the southeast of us.  Initially, it moved slowly towards us, then dimmed, brightened, moved back a bit, dimmed, brightened, moved forward again, dimmed, brightened and them moved down toward earth, and disappeared behind the treeline.  When it moved down, it moved more quickly than previously.  Through a pair of binoculars, I saw 4 distinct 4 lights instead of one.  Due to the darkness of the sky and the object, I did not discern the object's shape or size. Our backround:  a suburban street - initially 4 of the neighbors saw the red light from the front of the house, then came around to the back and asked if any of us in the backyard had noticed the red light.  We got up and looked, and saw as described above.  (Backyard is pretty dark.)  I did call the Buffalo Grove police to report the sighting, and they transferred me to the Lincolnshire police - so they should both have reports of the time I called.  Unfortunately, I did not call them until a few minutes after the object had disappeared.;42.1614;-87.9660000000001
