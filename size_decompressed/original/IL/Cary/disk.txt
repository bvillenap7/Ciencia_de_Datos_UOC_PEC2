I heard a loud sound, like a plane hovering but much louder, it made my house shake. I looked outside and about two houses away i saw a very low disc shaped craft that had green, blue, and red lights flashing on the side, they were like disco light looking. As soon as I looked out my window, it like sensed I saw it and started flying away, it just suddenly took off so i ran to the front of my house and ran outside and I saw it flying way too fast to be a plane and within 5 seconds it was out of eyesight.;42.2168;-88.2444999999999
