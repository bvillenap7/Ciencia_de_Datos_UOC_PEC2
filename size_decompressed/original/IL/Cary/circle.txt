Four unidentifiable orange objects hovering silently and slowly moving in the sky above Cary, IL;2011-07-30 22:45:00;4 minutes;Four unidentifiable orange objects hovering silently and slowly moving in the sky above Cary, IL. On Saturday July 30 at 9:45PM, my wife and I left the house to pick up our daughter and her friend from a baseball game.  Prior to that, we were relaxing and talking at home after a busy day of work around the house. We were heading west on a local road when in the sky above us was what originally looked like four planes in the distance flying in a landing pattern approaching O'hare airport.  At first, all four objects were what appeared to be a straight line.  As we drove a bit further and looked at the objects closer, we noticed that they were close and were not airplanes, so we pulled over behind another vehicle that was already pulled over looking at the objects. The objects had an orange color and made no noise.  The object at the far right started to fade as though it turned and was heading away in the opposite direction of where we were. Soon, it was gone from site. The remaining three objects slowly and silently, changed direction and converged into a triangle shape (if you connected the three objects).  The triangle shape they formed continued to converge getting smaller in size and then all three objects simultaneously faded and looked as though they turned and headed away from us. One other vehicle stopped along side of us to also view the strange lights. I tried to take a photo from my phone but all you can see is a very small dot. There is no doubt in our minds that what we saw was real and it was not a common aircraft that we see in the sky (i.e. airplanes, helicopters) on a daily basis.;42.2168;-88.2444999999999
Four round, and  silver objects flying high and changing formations.;2020-04-21 18:00:00;2 minutes;Four round, and  silver objects flying high and changing formations I was taking my parent’s dog outside.  Today was a clear day - blue skies and no clouds where this happened.  I looked up and saw 4 objects flying very high.  At first they flew in a line.  But then they started to change formations.  First they went into an arrow formation, then back into a line...it just kept changing.  They were all silver in color.  I know they weren’t commercial airliners or jets because there was no trail behind them.  I called my dad outside and he witnessed it too.  I was too stunned to grab my phone &#128542;42.2168;-88.2444999999999
