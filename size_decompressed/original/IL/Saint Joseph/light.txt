zig zag patterned light;2011-08-25 09:50:00;2 minutes;zig zag patterned light About 9:50 pm central time, i was outside smoking and i always look at the sky.  I know all the flight patterns of the airplanes that always fly over head.  I looked directly over head and saw a small light looking exactly like a star.  i thought it was a shotting star so i watched it. it was moving pretty decent speed. the next thing i know it is taking a zig zag pattern very sudden sharp turns. It proceeded to make these patterns for about 15-20 seconds.  It stopped a time or two then got dim but still visible but then dissapeared.;40.1208;-88.0524
