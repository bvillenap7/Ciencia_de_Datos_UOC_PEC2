MY NURSE FRIEND AND I WERE WORKING THE MIDNIGHT SHIFT AND DECIDED TO WALK OUT IN THE FRONT LAWN FOR OUR LUNCH BRAKE.THE WEATHER WAS PERFECT AND WARM,AND THE SKY WAS VERY CLEAR AND FULL OF STARS.AFTER AWHILE WE STOOD THERE LOOKING AT THE BIG DIPPER AND ORIONS BELT AND JUST CHATTING AT HOW THIS IS SO NICE TO TAKE A BRAKE OUTSIDE LIKE WE ALWAYS DID.I WAS LOOKING AGAIN TOWARDS THE DIRECTION OF THE BIG DIPPER WHEN I SAID TO MY FREIND HEY LOOK AT THE 3 GROUP OF STARS THAT ARE ALL SHAPED LIKE PERFECT HUGE TRIANGLES.SEEMING PUZZLED WE BOTH SAID WOW I NEVER NOTICED THOSE FORMATIONS BEFORE.THEN SUDDENLY ALL OF THEM IN PERFECT FORM SPUN CAREFULLY COMPLETLY LINED UP FROM LEFT TO RIGHT STILL AND ALL THE SAME SIZE.I EXCITEDLY YELLED OUT OUR YOU SEENIG THIS ARE YOU?HOPING SHE WAS AND WITH AN ASTONISHED YES I DO WE BOTH WITNESSED THE 3TRIANGLES SPIN ONCE MORE AND VERY SILENTLY MOVE EAST IN THE SKY AND UP INTILL THEY DISAPEARED. WHILE THEY WERE CLOSE I SAID WAIT LETS SEE IF WE CAN SEE THE REST OF THE SKY THROUGH THEM WHEN THEY WERE APPROACHING A CLUSTER OF STARS BECAUSE SO FAR THE INSIDE OF THE TREANGLES WERE BLACK.BUT WHEN THEY CROSSED THE PATH OF THE STAR CLUSTER YOU COULD SEE THEM PERFECTLY LIKE THESE 3 TRIANGLES WERE TRANSPARENT. BOTH OF US JUST LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER COMPLETLY ASTONISHED AND DASHED INSIDE TO TELL OUR OTHER CO-WORKERS. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));41.0851;-88.4064
