Was watching jet flying over head coming from east.  Suddenly below I witnessed 4 lights in a row front angled slightly down moving westward.  Was flying lower.  Lights almost seemed refractory but were flashing.  At first was thinking geese but never have I seen their wings refract sun light.  Then disappeared.
