PD));2019-12-22 18:35:00;15-20 minutes;Il. 14 bright objects thay appeared like stars in the sky evenly spaced with no sound or blinking lights. I was walking our 2 huskies and to the west of our home on the 7000 south rd. I noticed a string of what i thought were stars forming a constellation until i realized i have never seen this particular formation in the sky. the reason i thought they were stars at first , is because they didnt  blink like strobes on typical aircraft do.So when i stopped and picked a fixed object in the sky, i could see that all of the objects were moving in a straight line, evenly spaced apart and moving from the southwest to the northeast. There was no jet engine noise like the air traffic coming from O'hare and Midway airports. The other strange thing i noticed , is when eachn of the objects reached a certain area of the north easterly direction they were all travelling, they disappeared one after the other until they were all gone. The objects i observed were to high in the night sky to determin if they were saucer, cigar shape, or for that matter , maybe high altitud! e bombers or fighters flying in military formation and when they got to a certain altitude, they all turned off their landing lights one by one. I don't know what i witnessed, but for all of the years we have lived out here in the country and all of the times i have looked to the stars, i have never seen anything like i did tonight. I was the only witness to what i saw because by the time i got back to the house to get my wife to come outside to witness what i had seen, They were gone .;41.049;-88.083
