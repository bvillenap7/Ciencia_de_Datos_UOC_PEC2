Disc shaped object observed travelling at a high rate of speed in thunderstorm;2003-07-06 18:15:00;2 seconds;Disc shaped object observed travelling at a high rate of speed in thunderstorm I was following a storm as it developed near my home, and was taking pictures. This shot was taken facing due east. As I was framing the picture, using a through-the-lens camera, and while depressing the shutter I saw an object flash across the screen at a very high rate of speed. I looked immediately to see if I had captured the object in the digital image and I had. I am a professional consultant, and while I have some interest in UFO phenomenon, had not previously had any other experience of this type. I did some adjustments of the photo's to better view the object, but that's about it. I did submit this for posting at the Coast to Coast AM site, and it was published, but I forgot about it. Was recently at your site, and at the same time came across the pictures again, and decided to submit it, unfortunately 2 years after the fact. I just checked and interestingly, there is another report from Illinois of a disk shaped object at 15:50 that day. Did not check to see distance betwen Morrison and Elwood. Elwood is about 60 miles SW of Chicago.;41.4223;-88.0846
