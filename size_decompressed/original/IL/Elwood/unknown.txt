UFO sound only;2007-04-29 22:05:00;15 seconds;UFO sound only Elwood Illinois, 22:05 while watching TV my wife and I heard a noise that sounded like a helicopter whopping noise.  However the revolutions were too slow to be a helicopter (I flew on helicopters of all types in Viet Nam) the noise was very loud.   It sounded like the blade of a helicopter came loose and was headed into the house, I was almost afraid to run to the window (for fear of debris), but I did anyway, I saw nothing.  This noise only lasted about 10 to 15 seconds.;41.4223;-88.0846
