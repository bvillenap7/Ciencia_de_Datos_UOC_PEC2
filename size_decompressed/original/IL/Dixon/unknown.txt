(Northwestern Illinois)  Bizarre Noise.  Just before noon local time, a strange noise was heard outside my home. It sounded like pulsed white noise. It was cyclical there for one second followed by 2 seconds of non-noise, then repeated. It faded in quickly and dissipated slowly over about 30 seconds. Whatever it was sounded as though it passed quite close to the house. There were no reverberations observed but they may have been masked by sound inside the house. Also curiously, no Doppler shift was heard, although the sound seemed to muffle as it faded out. I have never heard a sound like this outside of a recording studio before. Only thing I could think of was it sounded like a jet engine low on fuel and cutting out and in, but there were no normal airplane noises associated with it. No street traffic observed either at the time.;41.8446;-89.4889
