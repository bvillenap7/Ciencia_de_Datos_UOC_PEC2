It was traveling fairly slow and then would disappear. At this point we all are watching. When in would go out of sight to the East it wouldreappear in the West. This is when we realized it was 2 flying almost on a loop and appeared to be surveying. This lasted about 10 minutes maybe longer. Then they both were flying together, one higher and one lower, almost side by side until they disappeared on the final loop.;41.8446;-89.4889
