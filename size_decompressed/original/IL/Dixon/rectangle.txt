It moved hoizonal making no noise we estimated it to be around 10 miles up, looked rectanglular in shape with both ends having a round hatch like opening, it was like you could see right through the  object, translucent, and it was 3 dimensional, you could see it had a front and bottom and 4 sides.  The front of it looked like fire shooting out of it and running down the sides of it.  The entire object was glowing a yellow/reddish hue, very bright.  At first we thought it was an air balloon on fire but it kept a straight course, slowed down and seemed to then speed up and take off to the west.   Almost as if it was looking at us, there were four of us outside one seeing it first and pointing it out to the others.;41.8446;-89.4889
