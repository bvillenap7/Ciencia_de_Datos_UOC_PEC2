I was driving in a caravan of work trucks and was not able to stop but we could see them very clearly as we drove. I saw the white dots which seemed to be at least a mile up in the sky.  They did not move while we drove and as we viewed them they would disapear in a very strange maner and then return like they would all rotate on and off.  We could see planes with contrails in the sky, local airplanes and birds and what we saw was nothing like anything I have ever seen in the day time We saw the white dots till we lost them in the trees aproximatly two minutes. What we saw was pretty cool and unexplained. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));41.8446;-89.4889
