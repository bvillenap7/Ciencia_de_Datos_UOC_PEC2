Hovering, yellowship light dissapears into early morning sky.;2011-11-12 05:30:00;About 10-20 Minutes;Hovering, yellowship light dissapears into early morning sky. Woke up about 5:30 AM to do an early morning paper route.  As I went to my car, I noticed a stationary light around the tree line off in the distance.  This light stayed stationary for about five minutes.  The light then began to move in my direction.  There was no noise.  No blinking lights...just a constant yellowish, light. The light moved higher into the sky until it became almost unnoticeable to my eyes.  About 5-10 minutes after the light drifted off, a jet was headed in the direction it was last seen, as if it was investigating. Not sure what it was, but that is why I am writing this down.;41.8446;-89.4889
