20 orange lights  passing over Northern Illinois;2011-05-27 21:45:00;20 minutes;20 orange lights  passing over Northern Illinois I first noticed this while watching TV. I at first thought it was a plane making numerous passes but thought it looked odd so I opened a window to liisten to whatever it was I was seeing. There was no definitive sound coming from the objects as they passed.  I went upstairs to have my wife look at what I was seeing.  She was as amazed as I was so we went out to the yard and were joined by my 18 year old son.  We counted at least 20 of these objects moving silently across the sky in a northerly direction.  They were moving at a rate similar to that of an aircraft however the light emitted from them seemed  more similar to a flaming glow compared to lights I seen every evening from planes in my area.  My son has captured 2 videos of this and posted them to his YouTube account.;42.3647;-88.1499
