PD));2012-01-10 19:22:00;5-6 seconds.;Jupiter-like Object Shrinks Down and Disappears At 7:22 PM on the tenth of January 2012, I happened to look out the back sliding glass door (facing West) and saw a stationary, Jupiter-like object at an approximate 45Â° angle that after 5-6 seconds of observation seemed to shrink down and disappear.   I called the hotline 10-15 minutes later and it was confirmed that the object was not an iridium satellite flare.;42.3647;-88.1499
