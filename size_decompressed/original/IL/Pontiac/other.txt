Four lights horizontal with the trajectory, flying very fast.;2004-02-27 22:30:00;10-15 sec.;Four lights horizontal with the trajectory, flying very fast. Around 10:30pm on Feb.27 2004 my wife and I were in our spa behind our house. I was staring at the Big Dipper because it looked so close, when I noticed four very muted lights fly through the dipper part.  It flew south till it got midway through the  tail and turned west kind of erractic, like it over compensated, then corrected itself.  The time was probably 10 to 15 seconds we could see the lights before it flew over our house where we lost sight of it.  We've seen lots of planes when we've been outside looking at the sky at night and this was not the normal actions or flight path of any plane we've ever seen. The sky was very bright and there wasn't any clouds in the sky. The lights were the size of stars, so I assumed this was very high up in the sky.  If you weren't looking at some star constellation very closely, you wouldn't see this.  It was almost stealthy-looking. We never saw any shape around the lights. The lights were moving too fast to be a normal plane. We've seen military planes very high up in the sky with their vapor trails, and satelites fly over,but this wasn't any thing like that. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length with this witness via telephone, and he sounded quite credible and sincere to us.  His description of the four objects, and how they moved and turned, seemed quite objective to us.  Please see wife's report for same date.  PD));40.8771;-88.6333
