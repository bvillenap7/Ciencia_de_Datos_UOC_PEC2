four horizontal lights, dimly lit and flying in a unusual way;2004-02-27 22:30:00;10-15 sec.;four horizontal lights, dimly lit and flying in a unusual way Sometime between 10:30 p.m and 10:50 p.m., we were looking at the sky, while outside in the yard.  The Big Dipper was in the eastern sky.  My husband was looking up and told me to look at the Big Dipper, that he could see something.  I observed four lights in a straight horizontal line, lights that looked like stars, because they seemed so high up in the sky.  The lites were moving towards the south, then they turned widely in an arc, then were heading west.  The lights were softly lit or dim, not  bright and stayed in a straight line the whole time I saw them.  They flew over our house heading west.  I couldn't see anything besides the lights, although the area around the lights seemed to be darker than the rest of the sky.  I've seen planes in the night skies and I know what they look like...this wasn't anything I had seen before.  And the pattern, or rather lack of pattern of the flight seemed erractic, not in a regular airplane-way. ((NUFORC Note:  Please see husband's report.  PD));40.8771;-88.6333
