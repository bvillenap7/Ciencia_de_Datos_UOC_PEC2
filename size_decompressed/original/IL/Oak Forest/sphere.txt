2 Red light ufo's passing across sky 9/ 30/05 from west to east and 3 red lights ufo's on 10/1/05 w/ ext. video;2005-09-30 23:15:00;10 minutes approx;2 Red light ufo's passing across sky 9/ 30/05 from west to east and 3 red lights ufo's on 10/1/05 w/ ext. video 2 round smaller Red flashing lighted objects were in the Sky as I was leaving my home late on Friday evening going from a west to an easterly direction on a moonless, very clear night. I video taped only about 2.5 minutes as I had to go into the house after watching them with neighbors, family and friends, for about 4-5 minutes, find my camera, a usable tape, etc. Each one went from about 50 degrees in the westerly sky to about 110 degrees from horizontal in the eastern sky. One left by almost instantaneously shooting about 5 to 7 degees across the sky the other appeared to go straight up quickly getting smaller quickly and vanishing in an upward fashion. I saw the other 3 objects at 1:10 am on 10/1/05 also and have extensive non-digital video tape on them,( I witnessed a low very large, bright Ufo last November on a cold moonless evening in the northwestern sky for 2 minutes in 2004. All incidences were reported by me to local police each time. ((personal information deleted));41.6078;-87.7523999999999
I was photgraphing the sun using binoculars and solar filters and later saw an object in the photo.;2009-03-20 12:00:00;10 seconds;I was photgraphing the sun using binoculars and solar filters and later saw an object in the photo. This object was photographed  using binoculars fitted with solar filters and a digital camera. I decided to try photographing the sun , though conditions were not optimal due to high clouds that afternoon. I did not notice the white object until the file was downloaded. I am an employee of CN rail, an amateur astro nomer, and  a beginning  National Weather Service weather spotter. The more I looked at this photo, the more intrigued I became. I would like to try and determine the size of this object . I only wish that I  had set  the resolution higher on the camera.;41.6078;-87.7523999999999
