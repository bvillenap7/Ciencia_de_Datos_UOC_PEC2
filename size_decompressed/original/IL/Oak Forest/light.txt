red dots seen in sky looked like a cell phone tower;2005-09-30 23:00:00;20:00 minutes;red dots seen in sky looked like a cell phone tower I saw 2 very bright red dots in the sky,  the first thing I thought was when did they install cell phone towers in my neighborhood, because that is what they looked like.  2 red dots one over the other almost like on a cell phone tower when there is one in the middle and another red light at the way top.  When I went to tell my parents I noticed it was moving east to west and now was over my house.  I then went to go watch them furthur and see what I can make them out to be when right as I went outside  and my friend who id just been with was telling me about them and i told him i already was looking at them.  They were very hard to miss if you even glanced at the sky.

2 Bright Red lights above my house, then gain altitude before heading east very slowly;2005-09-30 23:15:00;30minutes;2 Bright Red lights above my house, then gain altitude before heading east very slowly Arriving home and parking my car in the driveway, I noticed two bright RED lights almost above my Home. My Son who arrived at the same time also saw these lights. There movement was extremely slow. Thought they might be Hot air balloons, but heard no Noise that might be produced by a propane burner. My son called a meterological friend in Dekalb, Ill. some 45 miles away and he reported to us seeing only one red light to the eastnortheast (approx 45degrees)from his viewing area.  The two lights from first observation were seperated by 15 degrees from my vantage point and did not see any other lights to the north, although I did not scan the complete sky because of buildings and trees. As we observed for 5 minutes, these lights appeared to be dropping down. Not knowing what they were, I alerted other family members to get out of the house in case of a crash. As the rest of the family came out, we all observed for another ten minutes as these lights seem to be gaining altitude. At this point the lights were seperated by 5 degrees. My older Son went into the house and got his digital camcorder and started to video this event. As we continued to watch, I observerd a commercial aircraft fly East(90degrees) exactly between and above these lights. Estimate height of aircraft about 3500 feet. I did hear the faint jet noise from this plane and can only assume it was preparing for final approach to O'Hara using the Lake Michigan corridor. The surface wind was 5 mph from the southwest. We continued to observe the Red Lights for another 15-20 minutes and then disappeard to the east. Last sighting the two Red Lights were about 30 degrees apart before they disappeared. About 1:15 AM, my son alerted me and said that he now sees three Red Lights coming from the Southwest heading toward our house again. This observation was from his bedroom window and they were seperated by 10 - 15 degrees apart. We again went outside and watched from our backyard (west side of the house). My son again videotaped these lights. They were NOT in a triangle as some later reported. They seemed to be in a straight line. After about 7 minutes or so, the Red lights changed course and proceeded onto the east (90 degrees). They did not come over our house as the earlier sighting. AS we watched, the middle Red light overtook the first one and as it was doing that, both Red lights were woobling. It was only a few moments were we obsevered both lights coming together as one. Then seperated. We watched all three lights proceed east and were moving a little faster than the earlier sighting. I moved to the front of the house and watch the three red lights seperate heading east  rapidly until I lost interest and went inside. Last seen, they were somewhat in staggered line and following US 6 easterly direction.

I saw the three red lights in the sky over Oak Forest Illinois. They flashed like beacons. This happened around 12:30am;2005-10-01 00:30:00;hour;I saw the three red lights in the sky over Oak Forest Illinois. They flashed like beacons. This happened around 12:30am My friend had come in and told me about the lights that were outside. I didn't believe him and he said he had been watching them for ata least 15 minutes before he came in.  My boyfriend my friend then went outside.  My boyfriend came back in and told me that the lights were real.  I then went outside myself to see them. They were there and it was the strangest thing I have ever seen.  They looked like stars because they were diffinetly far enough away that they could have been stars but they were flashing.  There was three at first and then one red light disappeared.  They were at first in the shape of a triangle and then the lined up in a straight line.  The next thing I know the one on the far right disappeared.  The almost looked like beacons of some sort.  Like a plane has except they were further than a plane would ever be and they moved very very slowly across the sky.  They were bright enough where anyone could notice them.  Whatever it was it had no problem flying over a populated area.  It also made it easier to see them considering it was a clear night out.  If it was cloudy it would have been more difficult to see them.  Eventually I just got tired of watching them and went into the house around 1:30am. They were still out there though when I went in.

That night after closing my garage door I glanced as I normally do towards the North Star..to my amazement just west of the North star;2005-10-01 01:00:00;Five to Ten Minutes;That night after closing my garage door I glanced as I normally do towards the North Star..   to my amazement just west of the North star about the same angle were three red lights..  moving slowly in the sky.  there were two equidistant from each other leading and a third that followed.  They flickered much like a star or planet from atmospheric interference.  I didnt notice any constant pattern it was very infrequent and sometimes.. flickered like some one playing with a light switch rather than atmosphere interuption.they seem to be traveling east north east and there foward momentum seemed very un uniformed.  I woke my sixteen year old daughter up to witness this with me..  I even called my brother n lawâ€¦  He didnt observe them however my daughter did..at about a twenty degrees past the north star the lights took a more North East  direction and when they did this the last trailing light seem to go out..  however this is probably due to the overpowering lights of chicago on the horizon.. Tried to get video however my new digital video camera is crud at night...and my luck the battery was dead.. I am ex coast guardsman and currently work as a paramedic for a private company here in Chicago. My daughter is an honors student at a private catholic school here in Chicago.. The police and the FAA have been very blunt..no items discovered..  I find this very troubling to say the least.. Thank you for your time..

He said that they were now  back only with 3 and forming a triangle.  I went onto my deck and I only saw the last of it but it seemed to have went down almost exactly where the two early went down where i couldnt see them.  I still could not figure out what it was.

Bright red light moving slow with no blinking lights or noise;2013-04-14 20:00:00;15 minutes;bright red light moving slow with no blinking lights or noise My friend and I went outside to have a cigarette.  It was a very clear night so we were looking at the stars when I noticed a bright red light to the south of the sky.  It was moving much too slow to be an airplane.  No blinking lights and no noise.   After about 5 minutes I was so excited I got up on the railing of my friends deck to get a better look.  The intensity of the red got higher.  After about 10 minutes some trees got in the way and I could no longer see it. Im sure if the trees werenâ€™t there I could have watched it longer.
