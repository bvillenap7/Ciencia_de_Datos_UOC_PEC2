Strange air ship moving north to south over the southwest Chicago suburbs.;2004-08-21 22:00:00;half hour;Strange air ship moving north to south over the southwest Chicago suburbs. I realize the delay in this report however I just read an article on ABC7Chicago web site  (http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=local&id=4672066)  talking about the sighting of three red lights over Tinley Park, IL.  On August 21st 2004 and I thought I should add to that story what was witnessed by me and my family.  It was a beautiful evening. I was in my back yard in Oak Forest, IL.  With my wife, my two older brothers and my step son.   We were just hanging out enjoying the night when my oldest brother said check out those three red stars, and he pointed into the southern sky.  We all looked and noticed the three red lights that was probably described by a thousand people.  We saw them kind of hanging there, then moving in and out until, one by one they just kind of faded out. Not a sudden disappearance like turning off a light switch but rather a fade.  They would just fade slowly out. Shortly after that I noticed something strange in the northern sky.  There was this air ship (for a lack of a better term) that was moving from the north to the south.  This ship seemed to be moving slow but steady and as it got closer we got a real good look at it. It was black and shining and triangular. I could see the light from the surrounding townships reflecting off it or so it seemed. It seemed to be flying low also. Maybe two thousand feet off the deck, however I can’t say for sure. And it was silent. It didn’t make a sound, nothing at all and it was a real smooth flight path.  It didn’t deviate at all. It didn’t shake or anything. Just moving straight as an arrow.  Once it passed over our house (it was flying almost directly over our house) and headed out south it turned into one of those red lights for maybe three or four minutes and then faded like the other lights.  It was very strange to say the least.;41.6078;-87.7523999999999
Strange red lights as big as stars, blinking slowly.;2005-09-30 23:00:00;30 minutes;Strange red lights as big as stars, blinking slowly. Red lights in the sky - first 3, but one went across sky and disappeared.  The remaining 2 sat next to each other and were blinking - slowly.  One fizzled out, and the last one went across the sky - to the east- and then descended over trees.  It was completely quiet.  As bright as stars - as big as stars. (NUFORC Note:  All reports of the two sightings (23:15 hrs., 30SE05, and 01:10 hrs., 01OC05) from Illinois will be passed along to Dr. Mark Rodighier, Director of the CENTER FOR UFO STUDIES, Chicago, as well as to Mr. Dave Marler, State Director of the MUTUAL UFO NETWORK for the State of Illinois, who will pass them along to his Field Investigators in the Chicago area.   We would be most grateful if witnesses to this event would please submit a detailed report of their sighting, using the ONLINE REPORT FORM on our website, and we will pass those reports along to those two investigators above.

Are The Tinley Park Lights coming back for Halloween 2008?;2008-10-25 20:00:00;A few seconds;Are The Tinley Park Lights coming back for Halloween 2008? I was driving down 159th towards Oak Park Ave. when off to my left over the Forest Preserve I saw a triangular shape hovering above with red lights at each corner.    It stayed as I drove past.  It was not moving...just hanging about.  It was eerily similar to that of the Tinley Park Lights a few years ago and ironically enough it's just a little less than a week before Halloween.;41.6078;-87.7523999999999
The bright lights in the shape of a triangle, slowly moving over the eastern sky in Oak Forest, or the city over.;2008-11-04 17:14:00;?;The bright lights in the shape of a triangle, slowly moving over the eastern sky in Oak Forest, or the city over. I was on my way to work and as I was driving down 151st street and I noticed three lights in the sky, and they were not very bright, but able to be seen in the light.  Then I realized this looks just like the Tinley Park UFO triangle that occurred not to long ago in my neighborhood.  They were in the east sky.  I observed them for about a minute and they seemed to move toward each other, but then I had to move from the intersection so I did not block traffic.   When I arrived at my workplace it started to get darker but I did not see the lights.  Later on, when I arrived home around 9:50 PM, there were two lights still in the same are in the east sky and one light in the west sky.  They all were not moving, but then I was unable to see the remaining two lights in the east sky.  I believe the color of the lights the first time I saw them were red.  When I returned around 9:50 PM the seemed to be an off-white color.  I am color-blind though, and I don’t know how that would effect the story.   On my return home I picked up my friend, not color-blind, and he can vouch that the light was an off-white color.;41.6078;-87.7523999999999
