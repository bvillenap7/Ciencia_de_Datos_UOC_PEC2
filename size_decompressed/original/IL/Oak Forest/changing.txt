3 red lights altered formations and each indiviadual light disappeared at different times;2005-10-01 01:00:00;5-10 minutes;3 red lights altered formations and each indiviadual light disappeared at different times A friend and I spootes three red lights in a somewhat horizontal line around 1:00 a.m.  The light then formed a triangle.  I was able to tell that each light was made up by three smaller lights in a triangle.  The three main lights remained in the triangle until the top light disappeared.  The remaining two light moved closer to each other, and then farther away from each for a few minutes. AS they were altering their positions, they did not move in straight lines.  It looked as if the were hovering, as opposed to how an airplane moves(straight line).  The lights then appeared to signal each other by flickering.  One light would dim while the other got extremely bright, and then likewise.  After this action, the light on the right disappeared.  The remaining single light hovered around the sky for a while, and then also disappeared.
