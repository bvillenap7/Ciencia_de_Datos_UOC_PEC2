6 objects that apeared to be stars moving through the sky. no tail or trail. inteligent control;2013-08-04 22:00:00;~2 hours;6 objects that apeared to be stars moving through the sky. no tail or trail. inteligent control At  somewhere around 10pm central time, my wife and I went out on the back porch to smoke.  For some reason I happened to look to my right in the sky and there was what appeared to be  a star.  It was the size of the largest stars in the sky.  This one was MOVING!. It was only visible for about 30 seconds, and it clearly did not have a tail, or trail.  No flashing lights.  Just a  light similar to the majority of the stars in the sky.  It was moving North East.  Then we saw about 4 shooting stars and then another weird moving star about 10 minutes from the first one, this one was moving south east and it did the same as the last.  Lasted about 30 seconds to a minute before getting dimmer and dimmer and fading away.  Then in the next 20 minutes we saw 3 more shooting stars.  Then suddenly I spotted another moving star moving east  north east.  As I watched in amazement I noticed there was another one almost directly in its path moving a lot slower but going in similar directions.  As the faster one approached the slower one, it seemed to slow way down and curve to the north, they passed right by each other and the fast one sped up and curved back in its original east north east direction.  I thought we were seeing satellites until I saw these two.  Obviously the fast one was being controlled for it to bank the directions it did.  They both were in the sky for several minutes before appearing to dim out.  We saw 2 more of these after that.  None lasting more than a few minutes before seeming to just dim out.  It's probably important to note that all but 2 of these things we saw, had planes take the same path minutes after they disappeared.  I have checked on nasas website and it seems one or two of them could have been the space station and the japanese shuttle that was just launched.  But that only explains two of them. I am convinced what we saw was under intelligent control, and will die a happy man knowing I finally seen what I have believed in all my life.  My wife however has be en a skeptic her entire life, but this incident seems to have made her a believer, or at the very least a researcher.  I hope somebody else seen these things, so you know I am not crazy.;40.5656156862745;-89.6252470588236
