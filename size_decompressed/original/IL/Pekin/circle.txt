Green ball floating in the air.;2016-02-06 07:06:00;5 seconds;Green ball floating in the air I was just sitting in my living room, and I looked up out the window and the was a green ball of light floating above my neighbors house.  It was there for 5 seconds then it was gone! It went so fast I thought at first it was a airplane, but I've never seen an airplane move that fast or have a green light trailing behind it.
