Triangular and low-flying aircraft sighted at my house.;2008-04-04 22:25:00;less than 30 sec.;Triangular and low-flying aircraft sighted at my house. I saw a low-flying, slow-moving aircraft fly from the west and then turn towards the north. The engine noise was very silent and sounded like it was an airliner at high altitude. It had a light on the two back corners and possibly one on the nose. I had captured a short video on my cell phone but it is low quality and you can barely see the lights. Shortly after, there was another aircraft in the distant south-west which appeared to be heading in the same direction as the craft.;40.5656156862745;-89.6252470588236

MY SON WAS OUT IN BACK YARD OF MY MOTHERS HOUSE WHEN HE RAN IN THE HOUSE AND SAID HURRY AND LOOK AT THESE LIGHTS MOVING SOUTH TO NORTH.MY MOTHER AND I WENT OUTSIDE TO LOOK AND SAW 4 TRIANGLE SHAPE ORANGE AND RED LIGHTS. THEY WERE ABOUT 1500 FEET UP AND MOVING UNDERNEATH A HEAVY CLOUD COVER.WE HAVE HAD HEAVY RAINS MOST OF THE DAY AND CLOUD CEILING WAS LOW.  THE 4 LIGHTS WERE MOVING VERY SLOW IN A STRAIGHT FLIGHT PATH ONE BEHIND THE OTHER. THEY ALMOST CAME TO A STOP THEN ONE AFTER THE OTHER THEY DISAPPEARED. ONE MINUTE LATER ANOTHER GROUP OF 4 CAME BY ON SAME FIGHT PATH , WITH THE LAST LIGHT SPACED FARTHER BACK.  THEY DISAPEARED AT THE SAME LOCATION AS THE FIRST FOUR DID. THEY MADE NO SOUND.10 MINUTES LATER WE HEARD WHAT SOUNDED LIKE TO JETS MOVING AT FAST SPEED.
