Heading S.W.  It was triangular in shape with a bluish white light on lead point and at ends of trailing wing tips the lights seemed to have a defused glow in the direction and trail of flight  I watched until it was in a direct south direction at that time it stopped and hovered for a few seconds then shot straight up and disappeared.
