Flat craft with egg-shaped profile;2002-04-19 21:30:00;25-35 minutes;Flat craft with egg-shaped profile (The object was spotted in the evening sky by three adult observers- only one will speak on terms of anonymity.) The craft was spotted in the evening sky remaining motionless. It appeared to be stationary over a field some six blocks distant. Looking from the side, it had a flat bottom and top- but was egg-shaped in outline. It was built in three sandwiched layers: Top deck: Dark. Had a shiny band bisecting the craft just behind amidship (assuming the egg's pointed end to be a bow.) The width of this band was roughly one-fourth the length of the craft. The shiny band reflected moonlight quite well. Middle deck: Single row of narrowly-spaced oval lights arranged Red/Blue/Green all around the circumference of the object. Randomly flashing. Lower deck or hull: Bright luminous white. Witness said it wasn't blinding, but extra bright. Object remained stationary for 25-35 minutes, witnesses were too stunned to get an exact time. Object blinked out while main witness was moving in her car to get better look. Object estimated the size of two baseball fields Witness said it appeared to her the size of a chicken's egg held at arm's length- blocking the same amount of sky from view.;37.7756;-89.1027
