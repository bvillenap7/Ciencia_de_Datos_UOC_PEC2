Small shining dot flies straight North  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible satellite.  PD));2004-05-07 21:00:00;under 2 minutes;Small shining dot flies straight North The object viewed was a white pinpoint speck moving silently across the sky from South to North. It had the appearance of a shining dot.  About one-third the brightness of the ISS, travelling at an even, steady straight line and seemingly at a high altitude. No strobes or navigation lights visible. It was unusual enough in appearance to make me go grab a cheap pair of binoculars nearby, but I couldn't use them to track the dim light it was producing. It went on, fading from view in the distance.  The next night, on a lark, I went back out at 9PM Central to have a possible second look and was astonished to see the same sight replayed from horizon to horizon. Nothing was seen on the following nights.  I debated whether to submit this report, because I've had three previous sightings and know that UFOs get a *lot* more obvious than this!;37.7756;-89.1027
