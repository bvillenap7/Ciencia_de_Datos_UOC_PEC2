I pulled over and counted four at first but then they just kept coming.  I counted around eight total. I thought they could have been meteors but they were definitely within the atmosphere.  There was also no noise coming from them.   We live about twenty minutes from O'hare so we see a lot of planes but these were not planes.  Just curious if anyone else had seen the same thing?;42.0046421940928;-87.9931763713079
