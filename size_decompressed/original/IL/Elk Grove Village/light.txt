Two Unusual Orbs of Light Spotted Just Above Antenna at Elk Grove Village, IL.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus and Jupiter.  PD));2008-11-28 18:00:00;55 minutes;Two Unusual Orbs of Light Spotted Just Above Antenna at Elk Grove Village, Illinois It was early 6-o-clock in Elk Grove Village, Illinois it was a freezing, pitch-black night on Friday, November 28, 2008, when I had beheld a strange sight in the nighttime sky.  Being outside in downtown Elk Grove, I saw two illuminate orbs similar to stars, but unusually bright to have been stars. I had observed this strange phenomenon for about almost an hour, and from this observation I had noticed that it had not moved one bit from its original position, which in fact looked to be very close to a large, tall, radio station antenna in Elk Grove, observing it at a vantage point about four miles away. The two orbs of light could have been connected to form one spacecraft or separated as two different spacecraft because it had looked like they were in a straight, diagonal line above the ground. The bottom orb was brighter than the top orb as they both were hovering just above the tip of the 15 story-tall antenna the illuminate orbs being about 100 feet separated from each other.  At the end of the hour, both orbs had disappeared, as I went outside again from my house to check on it.  It was a really extraordinary thing that I had never seen before in my life, and I would really like to know exactly what I was looking at and if it was indeed a UFO. It would be much appreciated if someone who knew these kinds of phenomenon , and would be kind enough to give an explanation.
