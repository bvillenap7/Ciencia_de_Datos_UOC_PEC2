Traveling towards O'Hare/Chicago, Huge Low Flying 3 Tiered Inverted Triangle Flying Objects;2010-10-06 18:00:00;20 Minutes;Traveling towards O'Hare/Chicago, Huge Low Flying 3 Tiered Inverted Triangle Flying Objects I was traveling North on Rohlwing Road (53) when I saw brillant white lights in formation like an inverted 3 tiered triangle. All appeared stationary traveling East towards Chicago.  The span was enormous! I thought are they planes going to land at O'Hare but then I thought how can they have a tiered formation and all of a sudden on the right side tier, more lights appeared as if they were switched on.  I stopped and all of a sudden the second level tier light shot off from the left side and as fast as a blink of an eye was immediately to my left.  It glowed bigger and had a red hue and then all of a sudden it vanished like the light went out.  I looked to my right and the formation had changed, still tiered but so low. I can not believe that this is not in the paper and I am sure many people had to have seen this as it was so low and so big! I have never in my 48 years ever seen anything that moved so quickly in my life as I saw when that light left the tier and moved to my left.  I am not sure of the distance but it covered so many miles in less than a blink of eye.;42.0046421940928;-87.9931763713079
07-05-2014 red glowing circles.;2014-07-05 22:13:00;29 minutes;07-05-2014 red glowing circles at first we noticed 5 red glowing lights north of us coming from the west.  we calmly observed these objects as a total of 8 emerged.   These objects are not man made due to their movements and color.  Silent, no noise heard from the eight, red, glowing circles. the objects/ufo's are identical in description in the ufo's witnessed in phoenix az.   the objects we witness did not hover in one spot but rather moved around amoungst each other, as they flew dead from the west and shortly as we took notice of them, they changed course, continuing now north as if avoiding chicago international (ORD), and executive (pwk) airports.
