I live right next to airport so I'm used to seeing lots of lights and airplanes and seeing how close they are before they land. Last night we both saw this cigar shaped light that moved extremely fast vertically through the sky (like it was falling).  It was very quick and we both wereally thinkin it was a plane that crashed but the lights were too far away and didn't look like plane lights.  Also, if it was a plane crash, we haven't heard anything about that on the news.  I haven't seen anyone else mention they saw it.  I'm not sure what it could have been so a ufo is the only explanation. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
