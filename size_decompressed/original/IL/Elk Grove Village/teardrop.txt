Orange tear drop craft flying in the west.;2002-09-29 06:00:00;several minutes;Orange tear drop craft flying in the west. I was looking west from my apartment balcony.  I couldn't help but notice this bright orange object moving from north to west over the western horizon.  I beleive the color was orange because of the sunset reflecting off the object.  I thought it was a shooting star but it moved to slow.  Possibly an airplane?  It didn't fly like one.  I seemed like it took forever to cross the sky but then it was gone in a flash.  I took several photos of the object.  About an hour after sunset, I was out walking my dog and had this strange feeling I was being watched.  I looked directly up and saw a silver (kind of a mercury) bright light directly above me it looked like it was next to an airplane that was passing overhead.  The object sat there for a minute then it took off stright out of the sky.  It was as if some had just turned off light.  For some reason, my gut tells me that this was the same object I saw an hour oh so earlier.  I also believe there is a pilot or two out there that saw this thing.;42.0046421940928;-87.9931763713079
