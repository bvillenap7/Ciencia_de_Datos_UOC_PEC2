THE CALLED ME AT 9:48 PM AND REPORTED SEEING A LARGE BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT DIRECTLY OVERHEAD MOVING SLOWLY NORTH TO SOUTH, DIRECTLY OVERHEAD.  NO NOISE OR NAVIGATION LIGHTS.   I WENT OUT SIDE WHILE REMAINING IN PHONE CONVERSATION WITH SON.  I, TOO, OBSERVED THE OBJECT.   NEITHER OF US COULD HEAR ENGINE NOISE OR SEE A STROBE OR NAVIGATION LIGHTS.    AS THE LIGHT CONTINUED MOVING, WE BOTH SAW A MUCH SMALLER SPHERE OF WHITE LIGHT APPROACH THE OBJECT FROM THE SOUTH WEST.   AS IT DREW NEARER THE LARGER OBJECT AT THE POINT WHERE THEY POSSIBLY MERGED, THE SMALLER LIGHT DIMMED AND DISAPPEARED.   THE LARGE OBJECT THEN BEGAN TO MOVE A LITTLE FASTER DIMMING AND FINALLY GOING OUT.    AS THE LARGER OBJECT DIMMED THERE AGAIN WAS NO ENGINE NOISE HEARD, STROBE LIGHTS OR NAVIGATION LIGHTS SEEN.   CONTINUED TO WATCH THE AREA OF SKY WHERE LAST SAW LARGER OBJECT AS IT DIMMED TO NOTHINGNESS AND SEEN OR HEARD NOTHING.
