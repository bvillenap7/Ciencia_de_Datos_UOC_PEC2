The Curtain Call.;2005-11-22 17:00:00;15 min;The Curtain Call. We saw this tremendous object. About 100 foot across and not very high up. It looked like a brown, undulating curtain that was rather thick. It was noiseless and disappeared after a while. The dogs were barking at it.There's this satelite or something to the south-west of my place. When this thing passed by, this other object blazed up like it as on fire. (It has never done this before.)I contacted Nasa about it but they've not had time to get back on it (if they will). The closest I could find in similarity was a trifid nebula but those are WAY up there and we were watching this with nothing other than the naked eye. Alien or no. It was pretty awesome! P.S. There was a giant silver pinball thingy around the same area, too, a few days ago. A jet was trailing it. So, I could do a visual size estimate. The ball thing was monsterous. Yet, both passed behind some clouds and I only got to watch for about 6 minutes. We have always seen weird sky things for years. Scott Airforce Base is about a 2-3 hour drive from here. Most of the stuff is probably theirs (even though it's odd looking). Yet, some of this stuff is pretty far out. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous.  PD));38.6251;-88.9378
