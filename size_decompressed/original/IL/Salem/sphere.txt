I was walking down the train tracks near my house during the middle of the day and when I looked up I saw what looked exactly like a giant pinball gliding across the sky at a really low altitude without making a sound.  I was only able to see it for a few seconds before it went behind a tree line.  The sun reflecting off of it burnt the retina of my eyes from being so reflective.  Someone else I know has seen it on two separate occasions, where when they saw it during the night time it flew past some trees and the next day when they went back to the same location the trees were burnt around where it was at.  Attempts that she made to take pictures of it resulted in all the film in her camera being totally ruined as if it'd been burnt.  She reported that during the night time it has red and blue lights which I think at another time years before the time I witnessed it in this account, I saw it as well but at night judging by the way she described it.  I would submit an image but like I said, all the film in the camera that the pictures were taken with was ruined.
