Lasting 20 SEC On October 2, 2010 my fiancé and I were on a weekend vacation in Galena, Illinois.  We were outside enjoying the night when all of a sudden I noticed something different in the sky.  I was startled and unable to identify the object. It was completely quiet and pretty low in the sky.  It also seemed to be traveling in a straight line at a slow speed.  The object was shaped like a triangle with constant lights shining on each corner. It seemed like the center was black or dark and maybe transparent.  I grabbed my fiancé and had him look up as well.  And we both had no Idea what we were looking at. It lasted about 20 seconds. We both stood up to see and it better and it flew over the house and trees. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));42.4169;-90.4186
