A white light pulsing at a 2 second interval in illinois.;2006-12-26 06:30:00;5 minutes;A white light pulsing at a 2 second interval in illinois. I was driving home from work and looked up in the sky through the front window, approximately 100 yards up I noticed a bright white light pulsing off and on. The best way to describe it would be to say it pulsed at a 2 second interval OFF, ON, OFF, ON. I slowed down to try and see what direction it was traveling but I could not determine, it seemed to be moving slowly. I wish I had stopped but instead I drove about 35 mph. After turning 2 curves in the road I looked back over my shoulder and through my mirrors but could no longer see the light, it could have just been out of my line of sight. I have tried to dismiss it as an airplane but there were no other flashing lights nor can I think of an airplane with a light that would pulse in such a fashion. I have checked the Internet for similar reports but everything describing a white light changes to bluish or yellow light. The light I seen that morning never changed color.
