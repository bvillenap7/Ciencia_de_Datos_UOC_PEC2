On numerous occasions, myself and others have witnessed lights in the northern sky that do not seem to be any type of normal aircraft or tower beacons. These lights appear at various times between dusk and 1200 pm. They are green, white, and red in color and apear to shimmer all colors at once. They increase and decrease in intensity and will slowly fade out of sight. Sometimes they will reappear at a higher elevation or east or west slightly of there last illuminated position. They move very slowly and always seem to be several miles distant. There will be from one to three lights at a time, and sometimes all will be visible then randomly fade out and reappear. They have been seen at all times of the year and usually during fair weather.;40.312;-87.8255
