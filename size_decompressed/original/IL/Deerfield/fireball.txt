Fireballs over Deerfield, IL;2009-07-03 21:55:00;5 minutes;Fireballs over Deerfield, IL About two minutes after the fireworks display in another section of sky there was a fireball in the sky that was moving differently than a plane.  It moved horizontally almost like a comet but then it came to a complete stop!  After stopping for about 20 seconds it shot up into the sky so fast and disappeared like a ballon in the sky.  About 10 minutes later it was back and there was another one right next to it and they did the same thing and followed each other after they stopped and went back up into the sky.  Absolutely phenomenal!;42.1689;-87.8546000000001
Red/Orange fireballs or lights above northern Chicago suburbs;2013-07-14 21:56:00;3 minutes;Red/Orange fireballs or lights above northern Chicago suburbs Sitting outside on balcony, looking at the sky above the town area I began to notice five red or orange lights moving around each other from my right to the center of where I could see (as someone with flying experience I recognized this immediately as something out of the ordinary),   they spun around each other horizontally and relatively close to each other but moving a little bit father away, coming in and out of visibility, and about the size of what the stars seemed to me.  At this point, we began to notice almost all the stars in our sight began moving as if they were vibrating.  Basically simultaneously to the beginning of the stars moving, the red objects vanished.   25 minutes later (10:20 PM) we went back outside to find that all of the stars moved up into the sky almost directly above us, there was a jet flying through the area that the lights were in when they disappeared.;42.1689;-87.8546000000001
