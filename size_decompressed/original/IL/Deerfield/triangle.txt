Black Triangle over Chicago Suburbs spotted twice.;2007-06-08 13:00:00;5 minutes;Black Triangle over Chicago Suburbs spotted twice. I was walking up my driveway when i looked up and noticed a a object in the sky. i went and grabbed my binoculars and saw a black triangle shaped craft with three red lights i think there could have been two of them.they were moving very slowley heading east towards Lake Michigan. i ran and got my brother and we watched it for a few mor minutes. the last thing we saw it was make a sharp right turn to the south. I am positive this was a stealth fighter or bomber.  a few weeks later at our neighborhood block party i noticed three red lights i the same triangular pattern it was once again moveing extremely slowly this time there was also a slight haze around it. towards the end of the sighting it started ascending and leveled out it then gained an amazing amount of speed and darted out of sight.;42.1689;-87.8546000000001
