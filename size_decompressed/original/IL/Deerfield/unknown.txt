Weird twinkling light or array of lights flies around, then disappears.;2011-04-02 01:30:00;<1 minute;Weird twinkling light or array of lights flies around, then disappears Driving North on Wilmot Road, I watched a twinkling object which appeared to fluctuate significantly in its trajectory travel west to east and disappear. The object seemed to be moving (flying?) at a fairly high altitude, came across as being about the size of a distant aircraft or bright star from my perspective, and traveled at about the pace of a commercial airliner. It entered my vision from the west.  I thought its trajectory was unusual because it didn't follow a conventional/straight path, it moved in a sort of predictably alternating up-and-down motion as it traveled east.  Suspecting I was mistaken, I slowed my car to a stop on the otherwise empty road, watched it, and established to my surprise it was moving the way I thought it was. A moment later, it seemed to disappear altogether. Rationalizing at this point that all this might have a conventional explanation to the affect of it was a plane that flew behind a cloud,  I searched the sky carefully in the area of the disappearance and was alarmed to discover I could only see, vividly, the stars in the sky characteristic of near-perfect visibility-no clouds to be had.  Some to the near southwest were illuminated reddish by light pollution and could be distinguished from the deep black night sky. It hadn't even traveled across the whole length of sky visible from the road through the trees that surround it. I became anxious about how weird the whole thing seemed and hurried home.;42.1689;-87.8546000000001
