Bright green object slowly moving across the sky.;2007-06-09 22:21:00;4 minutes;Bright green object slowly moving across the sky. I was sitting in my car at work monitoring the property when in the distance I noticed some fireworks going off so I took my camera and began photographing them.  After about 15 minutes of watching I noticed something coming out from behind the trees.  It was bright green in color with a red line going down the center of it horizontally, which also seemed to be some re-circulating light.  It was moving very slowly through the area where I had seen the fireworks and after this object appeared the fireworks ceased to fired.  The object slowly moved across the sky until I could not see it anymore when it disappeared behind a warehouse down the road.;41.9180476190476;-88.1367571428571
