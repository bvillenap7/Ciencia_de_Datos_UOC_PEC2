I was driving home from work this afternoon, and while stopped waiting for a train to go by, I happened to look up into the sky (clear blue) and saw what to me at first looked like the glint of an airplane in the sunshine, but I then noticed it wasn't moving, it just sort of was motionless, but glimmering. It appeared to me like a very bright star shining in the blue sky, but a lot larger than a star. When the train passed, and I was able to start driving again, I tried to keep glancing at it, but lost sight of it as I drove on.;41.9180476190476;-88.1367571428571
