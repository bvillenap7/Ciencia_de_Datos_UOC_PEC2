Orange Triangular Object Over Carol Stream IL;2013-05-19 21:05:00;6-7 seconds;Orange Triangular Object Over Carol Stream IL Sunday, 5/19/2013  at 9:05pm (roughly) I witnessed with my daughter and her boyfriend, an object traveling from East to West in the night sky, nearly directly overhead. The object was oriented between directly over our head, half-way to the angle of the moon.  It was triangular, bright orange.  There were no flashing lights, no sound, no smell.    There was a wide glow/haze around the object.   We watched it travel for about 6 or 7 seconds from East to West (slightly northwest). The tips of the triangle were rounded in shape.   It was traveling at a consistent speed in what appeared to be a straight line. 2-3 minutes after we saw the object, we did see airplanes in the sky, and could definitely see the flashing lights of the airplane, and could hear the airplanes. The object we saw had no flashing lights and no sound at all.;41.9180476190476;-88.1367571428571
