New Year's day red scanning fireball.;2014-01-01 18:30:00;4 minutes;new years day red scanning fireball My name is ((man's name deleted)) I am 29 years old and work for an ambulance service, the other witness is my girlfriend ((woman's name deleted)) she is 28 and works for a physical therapy company.  We were in the living room of our 3rd floor apt on january 1st 2014 and around 630pm central standard time.  ((woman's name deleted)) had left our living room blinds to our patio open and we were watching television, when she made a shriek and screamed, What the hell is that!?   I quickly turned my head from the television to see what she was screaming about when I saw what looked to be a red kite flying independently but carrying some type of fire ball.   I did a double take and focused to see that is was a fireball and the red kite looked like a laser scanner of some sort.  Our apartment balcony faces north and as the scanning fireball passed our balcony at slight south east barring I quickly put my winter attire on and flew down 3 flights of stairs as tiffany went to the back of our apartment and continued to watch while recording on her cell phone.    On the ground I did not see much but a glowing ball traveling in the distance. I saw 2 men in a plow truck and asked them if they had saw the fireball and they said they were not paying attention.   After climbing back up three flights of stairs tiffany and I convened that what we saw was not of this world.;41.7523000000001;-88.0541
