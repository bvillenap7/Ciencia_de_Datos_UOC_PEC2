MY GIRLFRIEND AND I WERE USING A HIGH POWER SPOT LIGHT AND SIGNALLING INTO THE SKY.ROUGHLY 20 MINUTES PASSED OF INTERMITTENT FLASHING WHEN SUDDENLY A BLUE/WHITE LIGHT APPEARED AT A 60 DEG. ANGLE AND SINCE HEIGHTH IS DIFFICULT TO JUDGE I WOULD SAY IN EXCESS OF 10'000FT. AT THIS POINT THE BLUE/WHITE LIGHT FLASHED INTENSELY AS TO COPY THE SAME SIGNALS THAT WE WERE USING WITH THE SPOTLIGHT. IT THEN ACCELERATED HORIZONTALLY,THEN SLOWED TO A STOP WHEN THE LIGHT SOURCE FADED. APPROX. DURATION OF SIGHTING WAS 1 MIN. NOTE: ALTHOUGH THIS IS NOT RELATED TO THE ABOVE SIGHTING, ITS WORTH MENTIONING THAT ON TWO OTHER OCASSIONS WE WERE ABLE THROUGH THE SPOTLIGHT SIGNALLING TO BE WITNESS TO OTHER ANAMOLOUS LIGHTS, THAT IN MY OPINION CANNOT BE EXPLAINED BY THE STATUS QUO OF INFORMATION THAT I AM AWARE OF INVOLVING AERIAL PHENOMENON,ETC.;41.7523000000001;-88.0541
Bright white light moving to a stop and slowly dimming out;2001-06-23 23:35:00;10 seconds;Bright white light moving to a stop and slowly dimming out At approximately 11:35p.m. on 6/23/01 a luminous object came into view at about 40 degrees. The light was white in color and became visible while it traversed horizontally, so as to become visible from behind a set of trees. While moving, it was at least three times brighter than the lights of a commercial jet coming straight at you. As it moved just beyond the tree line, it slowed and concurrently so did its lumination. Its light source appeared to close in around itself to a dot, then no luminousity could be seen. This sighting lasted about 10 seconds, with myself, my father and my girlfriend as witnesses. One important factor in this sighting may have been due to my use of flashes with a high power spotlight. I've used this method before and the results of this have been positive. Unfortunately i couldn't ready the camcorder quick enough to catch the light on video.;41.7523000000001;-88.0541

The way the light look like a solid red ball but no blinking/no movement this is a major flight corridor into midway airport so I am used to seeing planes come and go 100 times a day sometimes. This light looked rather odd, then I ran in to get binoculars came out and it was gone. However in this same vicity in the Bolingbrook, Planfield area I have seen similar lights sitting moving a little side to side then blinking out this happened twice in the last two months. Hope this helps. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  We are mystified by that fact, given that the report was submitted just two days after the alleged sighting had occurred.  PD));41.7523000000001;-88.0541
Fours UFO's seen in Woodridge, IL, 6/9/07;2007-06-09 15:00:00;10 minutes;Fours UFO's seen in Woodridge, IL, 6/9/07 My husband and I were on the deck arguing and I looked up in the sky and saw a jet which had taken off from O'Hare airport.  Behind the jet, were 4 lights following.  At first I thought they may my mylar balloons, but I couldn't believe they would be that high.   As my husband and I continued arguing, I kept on watching.  I told him to look, but he was too heated up in the argument.  They then hovered towards the NE.  One moved out a bit, and then came back.   With some light grey clouds rolling over they continued to hover looking like stars.   One by one, they just disappeared.   After the argument, my husband said he could not see anything (there were 2-3 left) at that time.  They eventually disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));41.7523000000001;-88.0541

Got out cell phones to take pic & bright beam of light shot down from sky as I clicked pic IMG_0428.JPG. ((NUFORC Note:  We posted the photo provided by the witness, but with reservation, given the bizarre appearance of the shaft of light.  Subsequent analysis of the photo suggests that the photo is a montage, created by overlays.  It appears to have been PhotoShopped, and we are unable to reach the source of the photo via telephone.  NUFORC apologizes for having posted the misleading data on December 31st, 2016.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM Mr. Gene Weed, photo analyst.)) Peter, Woodridge, Illinois, Friday, December 23rd, 2016, @ 19:30 hrs. (CST) ANALYSIS First Impressions Photo did not include the source of light. Why take just one photo? Description does not match photo. DETAILS Sharp edges of white on tree indicate overlay Multiple white images on left of beam (opacity of second image layers not adjusted correctly) Roof gable (peak) can be seen through beam (impossible) indicate opacity settings of ~ 60% of second layer Multiple blue colors on top and bottom of beam (not pure white) No shadow from' Bright Beam', which normally accompanies such sightings Light Beam does not touch ground (impossible) Background shadows under cars from 'dimmer garage light, is brighter than 'Beam' (impossible), and additionally, shadow angle does not match the beam object. i.e.  No shadows or illumination on any object in photo are stemming from this 'Bright Beam' can be detected. All light shadows are from house. Using the camera exposure recorded ( see settings below) the 'Beam' would have saturated the entire photograph, or would have automatically adjusted the exposure settings. SUMMARY Authentic photograph with apparent overlay characteristic multiple points as described..
