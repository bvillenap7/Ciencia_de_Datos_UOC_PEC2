Three Glowing Lights In A Row.;2014-08-02 20:00:00;5-10 minutes;Three Glowing Lights In A Row My partner and I were out on our patio sitting enjoying the evening as the sun was going down, it was around 8PM and I was smoking a cigar and he was on his iPad.   I was looking at some of the wispy clouds turning purplish above us, when I noticed a ball of light approaching below cloud level, around the same height as a helicopter.  It was quiet and as it approached, I noticed it sort of shimmered orangish-yellow.   It was passing directly over us, and I told my partner, Look at that, what is that?  He thought it was plane or helicopter at first, but it made no sound and was just a ball of glowing light. I have no clue, but look over there, there's another one.   Just approaching over us was an identical shaped glowing ball of light, not very far behind the first one.  They were moving very slowly, almost like they were getting slower and slower the nearer to us they got.  We then saw a third appear, all three lights were in a row, almost equal! distance from each other, looking completely the same.  The lights weren't pulsing, more like glowing or pulsating, between orangish and a golden yellow.   I got up and followed the three lights to the end of the yard, where they became obscured by trees.  I tried to find them again but didn't see them anymore.  The whole event took less than 10 minutes.;41.7523000000001;-88.0541
