Going for a walk by Lake of Egypt power plant.;1994-07-04 20:00:00;5 min to 10;going for a walk by Lake of Egypt power plant On my way home from the local B.P. gas station  I was walking towards the railroad crossing and I noticed something and I stopped and saw no stars...  it sounds stuid but I couldn 't see any  over the Lake Of Egypt power plant. 8miles southof Marion IL.  I stopped and watched it. The length was as long as about 4 times the power plant.  I'm not sure what color it was but I would say it was black. It had no sound u would notice.  Cars passed me but didn't see it. At the angle I was at {thinking how to eplain this} the tracks are on a downhill slop and if I pointed out in front of me about a 45 degree angle i would say if u were at the sight, it crossed the road at the fire dept.(1/2 mile) to the dam (1/4 mile)  not sure.. it was moving the whole time really slow (it never hovered) about best guess 10 miles per hr. till it disappeard over the tree line.   Oh and never did any drugs (and never will) and at the time i didn't drink beer ( just for refence )  I'm 32 now and just thought i would let more than the 6 people that know now.  2 days later i called the airport to see if they had any thing fling out there at the time...  10 mins. later they came back and said no...  And then they asked my name ... and i hung up... ((name deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD));37.7240999999999;-88.9300999999999
