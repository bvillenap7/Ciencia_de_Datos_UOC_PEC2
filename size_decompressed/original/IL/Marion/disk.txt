Red Object Over Marion, Illinois;2006-06-07 02:34:00;3-4 minutes;Red Object Over Marion, Illinois My friend and I were coming home from working at my apartment.  When I pulled into the driveway I said, Oh my gosh, look at that UFO.  It took me a minute to process what we saw.  We both jumped out of the vehicle and stood in awe of the red glowing thing floating in the sky.  It didn't make any noise.  It was large.  It seemed to be in two parts, or at least to appear that way.  It disappeared very quickly.  I tried to photograph the incident but our digital camera was out of space and by the time I freed up a picture the object had disappeared.;37.7240999999999;-88.9300999999999
