My friend and her 3 1/2 year old daughter walked me to her front door when she noticed all of these strange lights in the sky and remarked on it.  She at first thought they weren't moving, but I was trying to determine whether they were moving or not.  In about a minute I figured out that they were moving, but very slowly, almost like they were floating.  We kept staring at them trying to figure out what they were.  She also eventually realized for herself that they were actually moving a little.  We kept staring at this strange phenomenon, but I was feeling cold on the front porch and wanted to get going.  I had the strange feeling that they would go away when I started to leave and that is exactly what they did.  It appeared as if the lights were going out a few at a time.  I realize that the timing was probably coincidental, but it was funny how I felt so strongly that was what was going to happen at least a mi! nute before I actually left.  I had been hoping to be able to keep watching them, while driving home, but when I began to walk off the porch the lights began to disappear at a faster rate.  They had begun to disappear a little before that, very slowly, I think when I began making a move to go prior to actually leaving the porch.  I remember seeing strange lights in the sky once before, maybe around 15 years ago, give or take a few years, but they were more off in the distance and they continued for quite some time.  I don't remember much about them, except that I was having a hard time determining if the lights were weather-related or some kind of flying crafts.;37.7240999999999;-88.9300999999999

I then saw that there were 3 more darting in and out of view through cloud cover.  I went in the house and got my roommate and she too witnessed this event.  The lights were extremely fast and would merge into a single body from time to time.  They were visible while in the cloud but would almost disappear when they would move between the clouds.  Yet, you could still see a faint trace as they moved in and out of the clouds.  They disappeared completely when the clouds became few and far between.;37.7240999999999;-88.9300999999999
