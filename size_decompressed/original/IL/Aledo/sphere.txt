Four white metalic spheres with red glass-ish window on the front heading East over Aledo, Il.;2011-04-28 12:00:00;about one minute;Four white metalic spheres with red glass-ish window on the front heading East over Aledo, Il. I was outside walking my dog, when four spherical crafts flew over-head about four miles off of the ground.  They were heading East.  The crafts were spherical and the outer walls appeared to be made of a metal like the kind used to build walls.  They weren't very large, in fact they were about the size of a full grown man sitting, if you wrapped a sphere of metal around him.  There was a red glass-like circle on the front.  I think it may have been a window.  There was no propulsion system on the other side.  No rocket, jet, fan, or anything it just flew.  There was a misty purple haze around it, and it left a trail behind it which was the same color.  The trail lasted maybe 30 seconds before disappearing.  They continued heading East until I couldnt see them anymore.;41.1964;-90.7374
