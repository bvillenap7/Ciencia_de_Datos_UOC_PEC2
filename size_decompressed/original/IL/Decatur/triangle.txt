Me and my good friend saw something very unusual at the zoo.;2002-09-24 00:36:00;45 Seconds;Me and my good friend saw something very unusual at the zoo. About five hours ago My good friend I went out for a drive. We live in a small town and decided to go to the zoo it was closed because it was very late. but anyway while we were walking to the park we saw what we thought was an airplane at first sight and my friend my a remark about it looking odd. I did't think anything of it because I don't really take stuff like this that serius.so we starded walking again and we sat down and he said man that thing is not a plain look at how big it is! so I looked at it again and this time it was alot closer and lower. It was a trianguler shaped thing with Big red lights on the three corners that had a haze like glow to them. It was moving very slowly to the south east. I looked a little to the south and I saw what apeared to be another one following it I looked exactly the same but was moveing a little faster and in the same direction. The second Object then speed up and seamed to pass the first and went over the tree's and we could no longer see. about ten seconds later the first one speed up and was out of sight and thats all we saw of them we hurried to the car and drove in the direction in witch they went but we saw nothing. I have never saw anything fly so low to the ground and be this big it scared both of use. They seemed massive and made very small sonar sounding noises every so often. I don't Beleive in UFO but this didn't look like a human aircraft it was like nothing I have ever saw. I have made a drawing of it and will send it to you via e-mail.;39.842296875;-88.9432820312499
