Each one appeared for approximately 2 seconds followed by the next one in the same location streaking southwestward.  They appeared to be shooting stars but only covered a small area of the sky before each one disappeared.  The total duration of the event was only 20-25 seconds.;39.842296875;-88.9432820312499
