In the eastern sky we saw a round, red object with smoke behind it.  The object was dropping down.  At first I thought it was an airpline on fire, crashing to the ground.  Then it turned to the right (south) and travelled for several seconds and then vanished.  As it turned the smoke became squiggly.  After the object vanished the smoke remained. See summary above - do not have any additional information.  Witnesses included a 42 year old woman who works in fundraising at a small, private university.  The other two witnesses were the woman's two children girl, age 11 and boy, age 5.;39.842296875;-88.9432820312499
