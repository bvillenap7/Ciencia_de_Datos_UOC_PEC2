At 5:50 central time, looked out the patio door to see a bright (big) glowing object in the Southwest direction of my home.  It was very bright, so I asked my husband to bring up his star chart on his phone, to see what star it was.  I went outside and angled the phone to the sky and there was not a star on it that showed that it should have been there.  Surprised by this, I went back inside and grabbed my video camera.  I took a few minutes of film of it olny, because my battery was going dead, but within 15 min. it was gone.  Just vanished! It was a clear night, but very cold.   I reported a sighting about a month ago, and this one looked just like the other one, but not seadly moving and without the helicoper present.;39.842296875;-88.9432820312499
