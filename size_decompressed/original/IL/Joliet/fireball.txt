20-25 fireballs over Joliet, Il.;2011-07-03 23:00:00;10 min;20-25 fireballs over Joliet,Il. Driving south on I-55 near US52.   A flash in the clouds got my attention, looked up and seen 20-25 orange/red lights moving S.E. to N.W. as these lights reached cloud deck, I was able to see white trails behind them and then disappearing.  Too high for fireworks, and chinese lanterns would have moving in a cross direction due to wind.   Winds were coming off of Lake Michigan in a S.W. direction.;41.5120129032258;-88.0679058064515
Two orange lights seen over Joliet, Illinois;2012-06-09 22:00:00;1 minute;Two orange lights seen over Joliet, Illinois My friend and I were in my front yard when she looked up and noticed 2 orange lights coming from the south heading north.  I watched for a few seconds and grabbed my cellphone to record it,however, it was too grainy.  This is simliar to the incident reported on 5/20 in California.  They trailed each other, no sounds, no contrails....as we continued watching the 2nd light dimmed and went completely out, the 1st one continued until we could no longer see it.  It is completely dark out here, with the exception of the ambient lights from the streets.  She also noticed that the 1st one appeared to have shift in color from orange to red and back again.

Several fireballs over Joliet, IL.;2013-05-04 21:30:00;30-40 minutes;Several fireballs over Joliet, IL. On May 4th, 2013 at 9:30p CT two objects that appeared like “fireballs” were in the sky above Joliet, IL.  There were actually several of these “balls” in the west for approximately 30-40 minutes.  They were mainly of light yellow or white in color.   Their movement was very erratic in random directions.  They flickered quite a bit and brightness scaled up and down, as well.   Most balls moved slowly and flickered- sometimes disappearing completely and reappearing.   However, there was one particularly large one that was much lower than the rest.  This large ball moved from the NW to the SW at a fast pace and relatively straight path.  The larger ball was also a much deeper color of orange with a trail behind it.    All of the balls seemed to just vanish suddenly.   I also have video footage taken with my iPhone.;41.5120129032258;-88.0679058064515
Orange burning light over Joliet, Il;2015-10-04 11:00:00;5 minutes;Orange burning light over Joliet, Il At 11 p.m. on 10-04-2015, out of the northeast from Joliet, IL, from approximately the Lockport area, a bright orange burning ball of light was heading southwest towards the Morris, IL, direction.  It was about 1k off the ground and was on a steady path directly over my house, as it passed being as bright as it was had no blinking lights to indicate an airplane and I could see no shape what so ever, just a burning orange light with an almost flame like flicker behind it.   As it passed there was no trail but made a steady very low shhhhh like sound.  As it went over there was an odd glow that faded as it continued on then it disappeared.   I called the local police to see if there were any reports, but they didnt know anything about it.  And no, I'm not crazy.;41.5120129032258;-88.0679058064515
