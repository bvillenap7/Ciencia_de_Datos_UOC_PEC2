Cold Case UFO Joliet, IL.;1979-09-30 21:03:00;5 seconds;Cold Case UFO Joliet, IL. My father and I were returning home from watching a Chicago Bears game. We stopped for dinner and then attempted to get back on the interstate to head home. We parked in an abandoned Gas station along I-55 to figure out how to get back onto the interstate. For some reason we both looked up and observed an egg shaped object that was approx 1,000 - 3,000 feet above moving at an incredible speed toward the south/south west. It went right over our car and reached the horizon in seconds. I only remember this as being a white glowing egg. My father thought he saw red lights in the shape. This craft made no noise and to this date has intrigued me. The only other information I remember is several weeks later there was an article in the local paper about UFO sightings in Michigan. The article detailed accounts of several Michigan Police officers that observed a glowing UFO that hovered over Lake Michigan. I believe the area was the Muskegon, MI area. The article indicated that the last event was on the same night we saw our UFO and that it shot off toward the south west. The time was 10pm EST and I saw my UFO at 9:03pm CST. Looking on a map my location was almost a direct line from the location of the Police reported UFO.  I know this is an old case, but I know what I saw and there was or is nothing on this earth that could move like that object did without making noise. It was too low to be a meteorite.
