Dimond shape craft with red lights hovering over Joliet, Il..;2006-09-30 22:00:00;10 min.;Dimond shape craft with red lights hovering over Joliet, Il.. My brother, his girlfriend, and I witnessed a dimond shaped craft that at first was hovering aprox. a half mile away from us.  At that distance it appeared as a red-whitish light. After 3 to 4 min. of hovering, the craft began to move slowly in our direction. It came to within 1000 ft. of us about 100' ft. in the air. At this time the distinct lights on the craft were clearly visible. Red reqtangle lights in a cross pattern on the bottom along with many white lights. The craft was small. I would think only one or two people could travel in the craft. The thing I was most amazed with was the absence of sound. After it passed us, my brother and I tried to run with it to get a longer look. The craft was traveling aporx. 30-40 mph., so needless to say, we did not keep up with it very long. We lost track of it in the nieghborhood. At 27, 26, and 24 years of age, it was the most amazing thing we have ever witnessed.;41.5120129032258;-88.0679058064515
