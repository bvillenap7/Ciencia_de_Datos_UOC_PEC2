7 Orange-Red lights hovering over Joliet, IL;2012-11-01 20:00:00;5 minutes;7 Orange-Red lights hovering over Joliet, IL My husband and I were driving toward Joliet from Louis Joliet Mall on Route 30, when we noticed about 7 red glowing lights in the sky by Auto Zone and Dennyâ€™s.  It was about 8pm.  It was completely strange.  To the north, three were floating pretty evenly spaced from one another and a little further south were three more in a slight triangular formation with another below them.  We tried to follow them, but they were disappearing.  We followed one onto a side street and noticed that it was EXTREMELY low to the ground (about 3 electrical poles high).  As soon as we got out of the car, we saw it just fade out.  That was it.  They were not planes, they were not flashing, they were orange-red glowing lights moving and hovering slowly.  This lasted about 5-10 minutes.;41.5120129032258;-88.0679058064515
5 orange balls of lights in V formation over Joliet, IL;2013-05-12 01:29:00;7 minutes;5 orange balls of lights in V formation over Joliet IL At 1:29 while sitting in my room with my roommate, I looked out the window and saw 1 bright orange light which was circular in shape move across the sky above my neighborhood I thought it was nothing then it split into 5 lights which looked identical to the original in a V formation similar too geese flying except they were slowly rotating in the sky.  I then got my roommate to look as well to confirm what I was seeing, I also got my younger brother to see as well.  They hovered in place for a few minutes.  We then went outside to get a better look.  They headed east away from my house and quickly flew out of sight.   This all happened in about 7 minutes overall.  None of us were on any kind of medications or drugs and we were not drinking.  We are 19, 20, and 9.  My friend who is also 19 saw them as well and took decent pictures.;41.5120129032258;-88.0679058064515
