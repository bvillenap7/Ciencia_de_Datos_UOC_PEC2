Orange/Red Glowing Triangular object travels across sky;2011-08-27 08:22:00;3 minutes;Orange/Red Glowing Triangular object travels across sky It was a clear evening, warm, no breeze. My husband and I and our dogs were sitting on the patio enjoying the evening air and looking at the star view. My husband went inside the house and I was sitting on the patio facing North. As I was looking at the sky I noticed an odd colored ball of light coming from the North, going South, it appeared to be orange/red. As it got closer I realized this was not a usual aircraft and ran to the door to call my husband to come out right away.  He did and he also saw it. It continued flying, not fast, and in a straight line. As it got closer over our head, I realized it was not round but triangular, with the point facing North, and very bright orange/red glowing light in the middle,there was a white haze surrounding the object,there was no sound,and it was traveling in a straight path, North to South.  It was not going real fast, so the whole incident probably lasted about 3 minutes. I ran inside to get my camera and ran back out and it was already over the tree line. We both have never seen anything like that and were just stunned at what we saw. I called 911 to report it also.  It looked to be about 4 times smaller than the moon. I couldn't really tell how close it was, but it was close enough for me to recognize that it was triangular shaped. I saw planes flying after it passed and they were much much higher than the object was.;41.5120129032258;-88.0679058064515
Lights in triangle formation, solitary fireball over interstate 55 near Joliet, Illinois;2012-04-21 21:15:00;5 minutes;lights in triangle formation, solitary fireball over interstate 55 near Joliet Illinois Around 21:15 on the 21st of April, 2012 my girlfriend and I were driving south on interstate 55 near the city of Joliet Illinois.  SHe was driving and noticed three peculiar lights in the sky that individually resembled small balls of fire.  They were gliding in a triangle shape at a constant speed.  Our car was going at around 70 mph.  At first I thought they may have been low flying helicopters or remote control airplanes. I have spent some time in the U.S. Air Force and am familiar with many different kinds of aircraft but after watching the lights for a little bit decided that I have never seen lights like those on any kind of aircraft previously. We noticed that off to the east there was one more solitary fireball flying low over the horizon.  It appeared to be moving at the same rate as the three lights above us.  It was partly cloudy that evening so judging the height at which the objects appeared is difficult but I would approximate it at a thousand feet or so. I opened my passenger window to see if I could hear any type of engine noise but heard nothing.  Granted, I was in a moving car on the highway.  The lights eventually passed overhead heading north.  The light at the tip of the triangle eventually faded out but the two at the base just kept flickering off into the distance until they were out of sight. We don't recall seeing any other commercial aircraft in the area which seems odd because there is a municipal airport in the vicinity.  After the sighting I called the Joliet Police Department to see if there had been any reports of strange lights in the sky.  The night commander informed me that no such reports had been made.
