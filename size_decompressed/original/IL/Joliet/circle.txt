Driving with Mom and saw a grey disk hovering over trees on the corner of our street;1984-05-01 18:00:00;3 minutes;Driving with Mom and saw a grey disk hovering over trees on the corner of our street I hadn't thought about this in quite some time, but after the recent media attention about Out of the Blue, I Googled ufo and found this site.  In 1984, when I was 15, I was driving home with my Mom from the store. It was dusk, so there was still some light left. We were heading down Caton Farm Road, which, at the time, was just a two lane countryish road.  When we were roughly a half mile from our street, we noticed a very bright white light up ahead just over the trees. It was completely out of place and we wondered out loud what it was. As we got closer and were able to see what was responsible for the light, and I think we about crapped our pants. There was a huge grey, metal disk just hovering above the trees over our neighbors house at the corner of our street. It was completely still. I wish I could say how big it was, but I honestly couldn't say.  My Mom pulled over on the side of Caton Farm, a couple hundred yards away from it, at which point I flew out of the car and ran towards it. My Mom, of course, got out of the car and started screaming bloody murder for me to come back.  I stood on the corner of my street and Caton Farm and just stared at the thing. It was above the trees (maybe a hundred feet) and shining a white light down that lit up my neighbors back yard. I can't remember how long it sat there in the sky, but it wasn't more than a minute or so. When it left, it was really surreal, because it looked like it wasn't moving that fast, but it disappeared from my sight so quickly. It just went up and then followed Caton Farm until it was gone.  I had never been so excited as when I saw that thing. The first thing I did when I got home was to call both the police station and the local airport to see if anyone else had reported it. No one had, unfortunately.  My Mom wouldn't talk about it with me and would get mad if I tried to bring it up. I think it really scared her.  The next day, I couldn't wait to tell everyone in my Earth Science class. I picked that class because the teacher was really cool, and we always had great discussions about weird stuff. Needless to say, I was just about laughed out of the classroom.  I told a few other people over the next couple of years, but after hearing are you sure it wasn't a helicopter one too many times, I never talk about it anymore.  Until I found this site, I thought I was one in a million to see such a thing. I'm glad to know I'm not. I just wish the government would come clean with what they know. I hate the fact that I saw this amazing thing and have no idea what it means. At any rate, I'm so glad I got to see it.
