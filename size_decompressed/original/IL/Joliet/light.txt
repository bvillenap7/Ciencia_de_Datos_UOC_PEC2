Red Lights over Illinois;2005-09-30 23:10:00;25min;Red Lights over Illinois I was driving home from work on September 30,2005 at 11:10pm when I noticed two red lights spaced far apart.  They looked like stars but they went on and off every 10 seconds or so.  I was headed east on 159th street and the lights were just to the northeast at about 50 degrees angle and remained spaced apart but did not seem to move.   I watched them from route 53 to LaGrange road, thats the last place I saw them. I'm surprised I didn,t crash. I was to curious as to what they were to take my eyes off of them.

Many moving  orange glowing lights over Joliet, IL.;2012-08-25 00:35:00;5 minutes;Many moving  orange glowing lights over Joliet, IL. The of morning August 25, 2012 12:30 am central time I was coming home from a get together with friends. I had called home letting my fianc√© know that I was a few minutes away. He decided to take the dog out so she could go pee.  He was outside with the dog when I pulled up. He ran over to the car and pulled the passenger door open yelled for me to get out and look at this. I hurried out of the car and looked up at the sky where he told me and this is what I saw: 3 orange glowing lights in the shape of a triangle moving slowly and smoothly going north.  Also we saw on other light moving much faster a little further away.  We heard no noise and it was clearly not a plane or a helicopter. We were able to see this for approximately 40-60 seconds and then they suddenly disappeared. They didn't go over the horizon or anything it was like they just vanished. We were shocked and didn't know what the hell we just saw.  After a minute or 2 we went into the house for maybe a minute and ha! d to go back out and look again. We walked outside and looked up again and saw about 10 to 15 more single orange glowing lights moving in the same direction and the triangle shape we had seen just minutes earlier. For a few minutes we thought that we were being attacked. We watched the second one for another 45-60 seconds and they disappeared in the same spot the first lights disappeared.;41.5120129032258;-88.0679058064515
