Fifty foot across sphere about 60 feet above a busy street in a bright sunny day. but hidden in the trees of a park and golf course;2001-05-17 15:00:00;3 Minutes;Fifty foot across sphere about 60 feet above a busy street in a bright sunny day. but hidden in the trees of a park and golf course This is in response to this report which I heard sometime in the summer on the coast to coast show while working the night shift. Occurred : 5/17/2001 06:00 (Entered as : 5/17/01 600) Reported: 5/18/2001 08:23 Posted: 3/11/2003 Location: Bolingbrook, IL Shape: Sphere Duration: IT WAS DARK GRAY AND HOVERED IN ONE PLACE IN THE SKY FOR AWHILE ,AS IT HOVERED IT KIND OF WOBBLED ,THEN IT WENT UP HIGHER IN THE AIR AND TOOK OFF REALLY FAST IN THE DIECTION OF LAKE MICHIGAN AND IT WAS GONE. I saw this low above the intersection of Jefferson and Essington Street from my part of town a block south , and thought at the time it was a new water tower. Due to the park I only saw the top third of the metal sphere and since they were building one to the south west of my home in Joliet I just thought they were buiding another one. Sphere from my distance away was about 50 feet in diameter. I had to pick up a friend who was blind and take him to his doctor on Essington Road and thought I would see the new water tower. I of course did not see it, and had filed it away, until the program that summer. May 17th is Norwegian Independence day and my brothers birthday, and being third generation Norwegian I could not forget the day. Listening to your show tonight on the Jeff Rense show I decided I would look up the report from Bolingbrook which is 10 miles north of Joliet as the ufo flys, and it was that report in the summer of 2001 that woke me up to my missing water tower that day. When I was four I saw my first Alien, he was a skinny ET the one in the movie that had to phone home, standing in my play room. A few months latter I saw my second, which in 1952 was not the same. The cover of Whitley Shriver's Communion was the first time I saw that grey big eye's who was looking in the window when I was looking out at a storm. The third one was in 1996 in the winter when I woke up looking at this little dwarf like being, and before I blacked out I thought to myself, I know you!  I had many experiences as a child, waking up with nose bleeds and screaming, that my mother remembers more of. I just thought I would mention this and add it to your collection. I finally decided in the summer of 2001 that UFO's were real, and I have come to grips with growing up on a farm in the cornlands of Illinois. You do a good job, and I thought at the time it was a few hours latter the Bolingbrook fellow had seen what I saw, either that morning or a few hours after I saw it. Where it was you could only see the top as it was only about 50 feet over a busy intersection in broad daylight but in the trees of the park just off the road. Thats all I can say about that one, however I have a friend who had an experience in my home in late 1996 early 1997, and that is another story. Keep up the good work.

Bolingbrook sighting in Illinois on May 17th 2001;2001-05-17 15:30:00;5 minutes;Bolingbrook sighting in Illinois on May 17th 2001 Just as those people in Bolingbrook reported at a later time, I saw a globe in the sky while traveling north. I thought it was the top of a new water tower as a golf course set of trees was covering the bottom 2/3rds of the the craft. It was a steel gray in color, and just hung there or at least the top of it did, and I asked myself, when did they build that! I saw the sighting on May 17th of 2001 on your sight and knew, it was exactly what I saw. The time was earlier than they said, but there is no water tower, for I chacked the area a hour or so later looking for it, it does not exist, yet I saw it!;41.5120129032258;-88.0679058064515
Three spheres at high altitude over Joliet Ill.;2007-07-15 20:00:00;2 min;Three spheres at high altitude over Joliet Ill. It was at the Chicagoland Motor Speedway right after the NASCAR race on July 15, 2007.  My brother, his son, my daughter and I were waiting for the crowds to clear so we could leave.   As the sun was setting in the west, I noticed a shiny light at a high altitude tracking directly toward us.  I am an retired USAF and current airline pilot.  I thought that it was the sun reflecting off of a airplane cruising eastward.  I pointed it out to my group.   As it got overhead, I could not make out the shape of an airplane.  Instead what we all saw appeared to be three round objects randomly circling each other as they progressed eastward.  When they got overhead and the reflected light no longer reached us, the object(s) disappeared.  No contrail was present. I said, Hey look, it's a UFO!  But deep down, I really thought it was possibly a satellite or the ISS in orbit.  I've tried to find historic data on satellite orbit tracks to determine if that was the case.  I haven't had any luck so far.   As I've read more on the subject of spheres, it appears that it may have not been a satellite.   So now I'm reporting it.;41.5120129032258;-88.0679058064515
Orange sphere with a tail pointing up.;2010-11-08 16:45:00;15 min.;Orange sphere with a tail pointing up. I was driving west and saw a bright orange sphere with a tail. It was lower than the new moon which was also low on the horizon in the west. It was in full view for several minutes and I lost sight of it when I entered  a lower spot in the road and arrived home, where it was no longer visible. I also saw what appeared to be the same thing in the middle of the night about 2 nights ago.;41.5120129032258;-88.0679058064515
Red or orange-red flaming globe hovering at about helicopter flight height.;2014-05-24 21:15:00;~10 minutes;red or orange-red flaming globe hovering at about helicopter flight height I was on my way home tonight at about 9:15 Central time.  I saw what appeared to be a round ball of fire hovering in the sky above the Louis Joliet Mall here in Joliet, IL.  It was red or red-orange in color with some yellow streaks in it.  It literally looked like someone picked up a flame and somehow enclosed it in a globe.  It looked like it was at about the height that a helicopter would fly at but did not appear to be moving.  The mall parking lot has large lights on tall poles and this was much larger than the lights and seemed to be almost perfectly round. I pulled off into my subdivision which has a lot of trees and drove slowly down the street and could see it on and off between the trees and I stopped once to look at it.  It didn't move and I rolled down the windows to listen for sounds of a airplane or helicopter.  I heard nothing.  I drove further up the street and lost it momentarily because of a large group of trees and then stopped at a large clearing and had an open view of the sky to the north.  Nothing was in sight.  I drove a block back to the south to a school parking lot so I could see in all directions and nothing was in sight.  The thing had completely disappeared in a matter of about 5 minutes. I've never seen anything like this and never heard of any UFO sightings that fit this description, but I'm convinced that this was not any kind of an airplane or helicopter. I'm a retired educator and I think I'm pretty observant.  This is the second time I've seen a possible UFO, but the first time was nothing as spectacular as this, and it was in Minnesota.  I don't know how frequently such sightings occur in this area.;41.5120129032258;-88.0679058064515
Two orange fire balls moving strangely.;2015-06-07 01:00:00;1 minute;Two orange fire balls moving strangely. Standing on my front stairs having a smoke facing west and saw two orange and reddish glowing balls looking almost like fire to my right.  One was smaller and a little further in front of the other one and a bit lower in the air.  Noticed the bigger one first due to it being brighter and changing in intensity.    No sound and did not appear to be lanterns.   They appeared north of me and seemed to be heading in a southwest direction almost towards me then changed and headed a bit northwest.  They were moving sort of quickly and there was almost no wind.   Went to get my phone to take a picture and they were already too far away heading in a north/northwest direction almost side by side.;41.5120129032258;-88.0679058064515
