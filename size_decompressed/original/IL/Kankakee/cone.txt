Bullet Shaped Craft, Huge, Emitting a Very pale light blue color It was the first warm night this year, and the sky was very clear, and the alley lights are concealed by my neighbors garage so I decided to look towards Orion’s Belt with my 7x35 color corrected Bushnell binoculars I had been just looking around and I panned left maybe 2 degrees and I saw something really odd.  It was a craft it looked like it was about ¼ inch wide, and maybe 3/8 of an inch long and it was so far out that it was fuzzy looking around the edges, and I know from experience as an ex- USCG base photographer and working with a lot of telephoto equipment that when things are really far away that they have less definition but they have to be damn far away.  To me that means, that this thing had to have been HUGE!  It did not seem to be reflecting light, because the light was evenly distributed across the entire surface, and the color was a very light blue it was like the light was being emitted by it.  The actual shape of the craft was, well it looked a lot like a (22) bullet, but without the rings on the back of it, it was not metallic but more like pale porcelain with this very pale light blue all over it. How fast was it going I have never seen anything move that fast in my life, and I’m 59 I have seen a lot!  This thing moved across what looked to me as a quarter of the night’s sky in about 8 seconds, that is to sa! y one thousand one, one thousand two etc, when I got to one thousand and eight it was gone. It flew in a perfect line and it past just under Orion’s Belt, and from where I was standing it seemed to be between 35-40 degrees off of the Western horizon.;41.1137;-87.8694
