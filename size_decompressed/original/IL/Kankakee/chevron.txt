Multiple small aircraft flying in formation, but one is tumbling without losing ground to others.;1999-07-30 14:00:00;30 seconds;Multiple small aircraft flying in formation, but one is tumbling without losing ground to others. I was driving west along IL-17, between Kankakee and Dwight, Illinois.  Off to my left, in the distance I saw what appeared at first to be a flock of birds.  Soon it was obvious they were air vehicles about six to eight in total.  They appeared to somewhat chevron shaped, black, fixed wing aircraft about four feet wing tip to wing tip and about one to two hundred feet off the ground.  They were traveling horizontal to the ground in a north north easterly direction.  A few things were very extraordinary.  There was no sign of any propulsion system nor bulges in the thin depth of the vehicle to accommodate a propulsion system.  But, by far the most amazing thing was that two of the vehicles were unstable.  One was wobbling, but the other was tumbling completely head over heels yet neither was falling behind the other vehicles which were very stable flying straight as an arrow.  I estimate their speed at about 200 MPH.  They passed almost directly over my car so I lost s! ight of them, but a notable thing happened.  The car rocked very noticeably in the direction of the aircraft travel, although not so violently that losing control of the car was an issue.Â  ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
