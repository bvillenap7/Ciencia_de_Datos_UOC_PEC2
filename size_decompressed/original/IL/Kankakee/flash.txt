I saw a single bright white light that either moved straight down or straight north for one second (No clouds or other objects in a dark sky to use as a reference. It did not leave any kind of trail.  I am in the aviation industry and it was definitely not an aircraft that I am aware of. Could of possibly been a shooting star but the light pollution from Kankakee and the Chicago suburbs was substantial so this is a very remote possibility plus, the light did not seem like a naturally occurring light because of itâ€™s brightness. There were cell towers near the road and it was not from one of those.;41.1137;-87.8694
