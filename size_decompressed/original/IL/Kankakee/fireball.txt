Me and my friend were taking a road trip to Chicago last night, and we decided to take the back way instead of the expressway.   As we were driving down IL-49 N, we saw what seemed to be a meteor.  It was round, with an orange/yellow tint, and had a short faint tail.  At first I expected it to be an extremely big shooting star, but there was no way. The UFO came down in the sky in a downward angle, stopped and hovered, then shot off and faded away extremely fast.  What my friend and I saw was definitely in this atmosphere, but was very far away.  Although it was farther away, I could tell it was a massive and circular object.  I had never seen anything like it in my entire life and full-heartedly believe that we saw an actual UFO last night.;41.1137;-87.8694
