I was lying in the grass within my backyard, peering into the clear blue sky at 5:00pm CST.  I haven't done this recently, however I've decided to live through my twin toddlers eyes lately.  The Sun was obviously still up...  And I was mesmerized by a tiny jet leaving its line in the sky (40-50k ft most likely).   The jet happened to pass what appeared to be a star... Bright star at that... Directly above me in the sky.   I looked away, rubbed my eyes, and looked again.  It took only a moment to find it again.   Not moving at all too.  I know it wasn't moving because I raised my arm and pointed at it... Stationary on the ground.  It didn't move ... Then it drifted straight south... At about the speed of that airliner.  I've seen satellites at night... But never during this bright daylight hour.   Anybody experience anything like this?;41.8209;-87.8515000000001
