Flying red ball seemed to stop and then continue on.  ((anonymous report));2018-12-31 20:55:00;2 minutes;Flying red ball seemed to stop and then continue on. We saw a red ball of light flying from the northwest heading southeast.  As it got closer, the color didn’t change, and it didn’t make any noise.  It seemed to stop and change direction slightly and continue on.   At first we thought it was an aircraft on fire.  It didn’t look like any helicopter or plane as many have passed overhead.   We do live near an airport, but it did not head in that direction.;41.8209;-87.8515000000001
