They seemed to be coming from the north and were heading more or less southeast. Three sets of neighbors (6 total) were outside together and saw this. They came in groups of 4 or five and were often in a diamond or triangular shape.  A few seemed alone.   As they moved to the southeast they got dimmer and disappeared. There was no audible noise. Observers: all between 50 and 64, one tradesman, 3 business, teacher, 3 with college degrees, one w/ grad school;41.8209;-87.8515000000001
