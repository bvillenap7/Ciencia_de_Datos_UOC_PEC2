August 21 (Chicago, IL)  Identified Objects;2004-08-21 22:00:00;10 Minutes;August 21 (Chicago, IL)  Identified Objects I was in Tinley Park on Oak Park avenue on my way to a bar.  We pulled into the parking lot of the bar and noticed 3 people standing in the parking lot starring up at the sky.   When we got out of the car we saw the 4 distinct red lights in the sky.  Three of them were in a triangle formation and one of them was out of formation.  They moved apart very slowly and each one eventually dimmed away until their were none.  My friend and I got back into the car and turned on a local talk radio station.   That is when we heard the announcement that the lights were F-16 afterburners lighting up.  This makes perfect sense because August 19-22 is the weekend of the Chicago Air and Water Show.  It's amazing to see how convincing the lights are.  We thought we were in the twilight zone... many people all standing around stopping what they are doing and looking up at the sky.  Here is a website about the air and water show.  http://abclocal.go.com/wls/ontv/2004_airandwatershow.html;41.6125750000001;-87.8580163461539

2 bright orange lights flashing (too wide apart to be a plane) in one spot, than moved to another stationary spot.;2004-11-14 17:05:00;1 hour;2 bright orange lights flashing (too wide apart to be a plane) in one spot, than moved to another stationary spot. While usually noticing planes and satellites from our elevated kitchen window, tonight we saw two orange lights strobing in one spot for approximately 10 minutes, than the object moved to the North than stayed in one place again for approx. Another 5-10 minutes. I have always thought all these reports were satellites, tonight, however, it was different, thru a set of binoculors, this was no plane or satellite!;41.6125750000001;-87.8580163461539
Two red lights of undetermined origin over Orland Park, IL (USA);2005-09-30 23:15:00;20-25 minutes;Two red lights of undetermined origin over Orland Park, IL (USA) In the southern sky, saw two red lights in a line, not quite aligned north to south but oriented just a bit to the northeast-southwest of that line. As the lights moved in the sky, their movement relative to each other was independent though related, and they seemed to stay at the same altitude. They were spherical in shape and very prominent in the night sky. They did not blink or emit any noise or other light. They were first observed in an area south of my position but gradually moved to the north and east, re-orienting to a more northwest-southeast line relative to each other. The movement did not match the observed movement of a balloon or blimp. If unpowered, the wind that night should have carried them away. Unable to make out any more detail using binoculars. (NUFORC Note:  All reports of the two sightings (23:15 hrs., 30SE05, and 01:10 hrs., 01OC05) from Illinois will be passed along to Dr. Mark Rodighier, Director of the CENTER FOR UFO STUDIES, Chicago, as well as to Mr. Dave Marler, State Director of the MUTUAL UFO NETWORK for the State of Illinois, who will pass them along to his Field Investigators in the Chicago area.   We would be most grateful if witnesses to this event would please submit a detailed report of their sighting, using the ONLINE REPORT FORM on our website, and we will pass those reports along to those two investigators above.
