When we were approaching 135th street we start noticing objects in the sky in groups of 2 spaced far apart heading west across Harlem.  We counted approximately 14 objects by the time we got to 79th street.   We had no longer seen any more after 79th street and continued going north until we got home.   They were either egg shaped or cylindrical shaped and were very high in altitude to get an accurate description.   There appeared to be a color on the top and bottom of the object.;41.6125750000001;-87.8580163461539
