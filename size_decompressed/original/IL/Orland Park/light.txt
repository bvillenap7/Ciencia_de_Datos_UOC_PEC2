At points the lights got brighter and dimer, and it appeared to be in sequence, as in when 1 would get dimmer, the other would be bright, and the other would get brighter as the other would go dimmer. I dont know the time the lights appeared, but I witnessed them for about 15 to 20 minutes as the moved across the sky slowly. Thier altitude appeared to be far to high to be a helecopter and we heard no noise. 5 of my friends and I were at a car show when we witnessed it and we could not conclude what they were. There were about 30-40 other people and none of them could figure it out either, people were taking photos with thier camera phones and cameras, one person video taped it, but when we asked him he said what the hell are those things, when I try to zoom in on them, they dont show up on my camera. I have absolutely no idea what they could have been, and I would really like to find out. This occured also at what appeared to be extreamly high above the gound, and it occured near one of the largest flight paths for either O'Hare or Midway Airports in Chicago. The only thing I could possibly think they were would be someone on the ground with very powerful ground based lazers, but there were no clouds for them to reflect off of. The objects appeared to leave a small trail when they left, but it was hard to confirm this, since I only saw 2 disappear, and only looked for a trail when the last one left.

UFO sightings over Orland Park IL and Tinely Park IL;2004-10-31 19:50:00;20 min;UFO sightings over Orland Park IL and Tinely Park IL DESCRIPTION OF OBSERVERS- My mother was the first person to notice the 3 lights in the sky at approximately 7:50pm (CST). She was walking out some friends of the family and her sister to their cars and all 5 of those people noticed the lights. My mother then called myself, my Father, and my sister out to the driveway to see the lights. We then went and got our next door neighbors to come and see the unknown lights as well. Since I work at a 24-hour news station here in Chicago I called the station to try and let the news director know what we were seeing, however, they were unreachable. I then called two friends in two different parts of our town (yet still within Orland Park) to look up and see the lights, they too were able to see the lights. One of my mother’s friends (who had been walking to her car) she called her husband who was in Tinely Park (an adjacent town to Orland) and he too confirmed that he saw the lights. One of my friends in Orland that I called also saw the lights from his driveway with a family that was out trick or treating. The ages of the witness' varied in age from 13 at the youngest to mid-60's.  DESCRIPTION OF OBJECTS- there were three distinct Bright Red lights in the sky. These lights were similar to the red lights that are on top of Radio and Cell phone towers.  However these objects were moving, incredibly slowly. They maintained a steady pace similar in speed to a dirigible. The three lights were too far apart and too high to be planes, dirigibles, or balloons. Since we live in an area that has a high air traffic concentration (the O’Hare and midway flight path triangle) we are used to seeing lights in the sky, several commercial planes flew below the lights on there way to and from the airports. There was full cloud cover at a very high altitude, so we were unable to see any stars, however these three lights remained totally below the clouds during the entire 20 minutes.  DESCRIPTION OF WHAT OBJECTS DID- the three lights came in from the southwest when we first noticed, them moved toward the north (towards us), the three lights proceeded south east then after several of the people in our group had begun calling friends and family on our cell phones, the lights were too far away to be seen by 8:17pm. The lights maintained an obtuse scalene triangle formation during the twenty minutes. The distances between the objects remained relatively constant throughout the sighting. The lights did not change speed at all during the sighting, nor did they move in directions that would be impossible for conventional aircraft. Although the near hovering speed and the high altitude maintained by the objects completely rules out any helicopters. There was no noise heard from the objects.  DESCRIPTION OF BACKGROUNDS OF OBSERVERS- I'm a 23-year-old college Graduate and I work at local 24-hour news station covering the Chicagoland Area. My father is a 53-year-old college graduate and has worked in sales for over 35 years. My mother is a 53-year-old college graduate and homemaker. My sister is a 15-year-old high school sophomore. My neighbor’s are in their mid-60's and both hold masters degree's in education, one is a college professor at a nearby college, the other teaches elementary school. Our friends of family included our former neighbor (ties in her 40's and a business owner), her husband in his 40's and is a business owner as well (whom she called on the cell phone), and her daughter (13 in junior high school). The two friends that I called on the phone are both 24 and are currently enrolled in college. My mothers sister is in her 50's, holds a college degree and is a nurse at a local hospital.;41.6125750000001;-87.8580163461539

Strang red lights appear in the sky.;2005-09-30 23:00:00;5-7 minutes;Strang red lights appear in the sky. I was outside in front of my house late Friday night, and I saw what looked like two red stars.  I couldn't believe what I was seeing so I went into the house and got my boyfriend to verify what I was seeing.   He was also amazed and so we brought my sister outside to make sure we weren't just seeing things.  We were all amazed by these red lights.  It looked just like two red stars.   At first we thought they might be airplane lights but then we used reference points to see if they were moving and neither one of them moved.   Also, airplane lights blink rythmically and these lights had absolutely no blinking pattern.  They were fading in and out and almost twinkling at the same time.   Another thing that was very odd was that the color was not stark red rather, it was an orangish-red.  Then after about five to seven minutes they just vanished.   Two days later, an article appeard in the local newspaper saying that many people in the area witnessed this as well.  -Very strange!

September 30th sights in Orland Park Illinois of the 3 red lights.;2005-09-30 23:00:00;45 minutes;September 30th sights in Orland Park Illinois of the 3 red lights The first red light came roughly around 11pm heading North.  Then it just stopped in the air and stayed there for about 15 minutes.  It was then that i took a walk around my car to see it from a different angle but instead i looked South and saw two more red lights racing towards the first.  When they finally caught up they made a triangular formation for about a minute, then lined up in a row.    At that point i drove to another friends house at about 11:35pm and when i got to his house he said the first light had turned from red to yellow (color of a star) but the last two red lights were still there.   By 11:50 all three red lights had either disappeared or changed color into that of a regular star and we saw no more of them that night/morning.

Red lights over sky of Orland Park, IL;2005-09-30 23:25:00;10 minutes;Red lights over sky of Orland Park, IL At approximately 11:25 p.m. on 9/30/05 I got a call from a friend to go look outside at the sky to the east.  Immediately I noticed two bright red dots in the sky.  Neither were moving.  After a few minutes the lights began to fade in and out of visibility.   The lights were far too bright to be that of an airplane and also were not moving, so I ruled that out immediately.  I went in my house for a minute to get a camera but when I returned the lights had disappeared.  I'm familiar with doppler shift and this was definitely not that...the lights were way too bright.

I watched them and thought there were an awful lot of planes out that night.  Then I noticed that two of the red lights seem to stay in the same spot and were not moving.  I watched them for a while and noticed that they seem to be pulsing.  It appeared to have several little red lights pulsing around a larger red light in the middle that did not pulse but stayed constant.  I got my husband out of bed and told him he should get up and look at these strange red lights in the sky.  He looked at them with binoculars but to me I could see them better with a naked eye.  We watched for a while and noticed they were getting dimmer they seemed to be going further out in the sky they did not go north or south just shot straight back into the night sky.  They got dimmer and dimmer.  I looked out later that night and they were gone sometime after midnight.

Red lights in sky over Orland Park, Illinois;2005-10-01 00:57:00;7 minutes;Red lights in sky over Orland Park, Illinois On Oct. 1, 2005 between 0057 and 0103 hours CST, I observed three red lights in the eastern sky.  I do not know how long previous to that they had been visible.  I was advised of the lights by a family member who had just arrived home by automobile.  The lights had been visible to the family member while driving east on 151st St. between Route 45 and 94th Ave. (approximately 5/8th mile north and ¼ mile west of and 5 minutes from home). From that location lights were in southeast sky  Following are my observations:  The three lights were approximately 40 degrees above the eastern horizon.  For comparison they were about the same distance above the horizon as the star Belelgeuse was at that time.  I am 6’ tall.  With my left hand and arm fully outstretched, when the south (or right) light was lined up along the right edge of my pointer finger, the north (or left) light was lined up with the left edge of my middle finger.  The southernmost of the three lights was due east.  The northernmost light was about the same distance north  of due east as Betelgeuse was south of due east.  The lights were of a brightness similar to that of the anti-collision lights seen on commercial broadcast antennas.  The color was similar to that of the red LED on the tape recorder I was later making notes into.  The planet Mars was much higher in the sky, almost due south and almost overhead.  The lights were much brighter and much, much redder than Mars.  The lights pulsated, meaning the brightness varied, but did not disappear.   Pulsation was independent of other lights.  The lights were equidistant from one another.  From a drawing I made during the sighting, the lights were at an angle of about 45 degrees from the horizontal with the south light being the “high” light.  When I first sighted the lights, the middle light was slightly out of line with the other two lights, being slightly above an imaginary line drawn between the two outer lights.  The middle light slowly drifted closer to being in line with the other.  As a whole, the group of lights was almost stationary, with just the slightest drift to the north.  A commercial type airplane flew from north to south during the sighting, and appeared to be between me and the lights.  I am very familiar with the commercial air traffic in this area due to our being under one of the approach paths to Chicago Midway airport.  What was unusual was the altitude of the aircraft.   The aircraft was at the low altitude that I normally see inbound craft at while in the approach pattern to Midway.   The aircraft was heading south, away from Midway.   Southbound craft are normally much higher in the sky and under full power.   Perhaps he had been asked to take a look.  The sky was exceptionally clear.  In the Chicago area you do not get nights this clear very often, usually only in the dead of winter.  The weather at Midway Airport at 0053 Oct. 1, was 58 degrees, clear, SW 9.  Although I assume totally unconnected with sighting, family member did see white meteorite trail in sky almost overhead going south to north during sighting.  During the sighting, I observed a neighbor looking out his second storey window.  I verified that he also had lights in sight.  He also confirmed this later in the day.  Family member and I agreed that we would maneuver by automobile to get a better fix on location of lights.  We went inside to collect cell phone, police/air scanner, tape recorder, etc.  Another family member stayed outside to observe.  By the time I came back outside lights were gone.  Family member who had stayed outside had seen lights disappear.   We did drive around the area for a while but were unable to reacquire lights.  Did not hear anything on scanner concerning lights.

After watching a few jets pass by the area, it was apparent that these objects were not jets.  I focused on these objects for about 10 minutes as they tracked simultaneously across the sky down and to the west.  In about 10 minutes, I would estimate they moved no more than 5 degrees.  Faster than stars move, but much slower than planes.   They appeared to be quite far apart but they moved in exactly the same direction and distance in that time.  I kept my head fixed against my car seat and used various fixed objects nearby to gauge the motion.
