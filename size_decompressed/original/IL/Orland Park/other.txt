My friends and I saw three lights that resembled bright red stars rearranging themselves in the northern sky.;2005-09-30 23:00:00;10-15 minutes;My friends and I saw three lights that resembled bright red stars rearranging themselves in the northern sky. Two of my friends and I were driving in my friend's car, and in the sky to the north we saw three intense red lights.  To me, they looked almost exactly like stars, only bright red.  I've only taken an Astronomy 100 class, so I don't know too much about those kinds of things, but I couldn't think of any possible explanation for what I saw.   The red lights were moving, but , rather than actually moving to another place, they were more or less moving around in the same area of the sky rearranging their shape.  For a while they were arranged like a triangle, then a straight line, then a triangle again.   We tried calling other people- my friend called his girlfriend in Champaign, IL- but nobody else saw anything. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the date of the incident may have been September 30, 2005.  Please see other reports.  PD));41.6125750000001;-87.8580163461539
3 lights in a triangle and singular lights followed.;2013-06-08 23:30:00;10 minutes;3 lights in a triangle and singular lights followed. I did not see the 1st singular object but my friend did. I saw the second that was 3 objects in a triangle that looked slow moving in a straight path from NE to SW then after about a minute the left light dipped down and the other 2 continued and went behind trees and out of sight.  Then there was a series of singular lights in what appeared to be a straight path for about 10 minutes.  There was no usual aviation lights and did not have audible sounds. There were no trails, just a constant burning light on every object. I am not sure what this was would of dismissed it as some science experiment but I have a friend and my father who was in the Korean war kind of perplexed as to what we saw.  I did manage to get a pic and some really bad video on my cell phone.;41.6125750000001;-87.8580163461539
Unusual markings.;2016-09-05 04:00:00;During the night;Unusual markings I woke up in the morning with three equally symmetrical dots on my left upper wrist.  I am not aware of any insects in our room or bed.  I do see a lot of activity around our house in the sky.  I have seen this strange neon green like shoot down about 5 times now.  Looks like nickelodean slime green color.  I was apart of the Tinley lights and the phase sighting.  I am a believer, but as much as I want to believe, I really like hard evidence.
