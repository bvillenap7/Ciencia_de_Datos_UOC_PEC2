5 spheres rising and headed north, 2 silver, 3 white;2005-06-19 09:00:00;20 minutes;5 spheres rising and headed north, 2 silver, 3 white I was standing at a park near 139th and Wolf road looking west when I observed 5 spheres rising almost like a bundle of balloons let go, 3 white, 2 shiny silver. As they rose, the three white objects stayed aligned with each other in a diagonal line, one silver to the left and and one silver to the right of the 3 white objects. While the two silver objects kept a little distance from the group, the three white objects would go from a straight line equal distances apart, like the famous star formation, to forming a triangle. They seemed to be drifting north and up and at one point i saw what looked like a bright orange airplane flying very close, just above or through,  the objects, it was about a millimeter long at arms length and the objects were like pinpoints. There were almost no clouds in the sky at this time and eventually the objects were too hard to see/follow. I thought it was weird that i could see the orange plane by the objects but couldn't really see the color of other planes that were much closer.;41.6125750000001;-87.8580163461539
