Three red dots in triangular shape;2004-10-31 23:00:00;30 min;Three red dots in triangular shape Me and a bunch of my friends after trick or treating were standing outside when I looked up and asked all my friends if they saw what I was seeing. Three red dots seemed to be in a triangular shape off towards Tinley Park. We thought maybe they were just planes going by, but I told them that it defintiely wasn't becuase of how long they were there. The red dots seemed to be floating farther away or maybe just disappearing, but they lasted about 30 minutes. Besides the red lights or whatever they were we saw a lot of planes going around and not just regular boeing jets, there were helicopters all over. I can see that many other people have reported this too. We first thought that maybe it had something to do with terrorists considering whats been going on, but theres no doubt in my mind that this is nothing like that. We noticed the middle dot seemed to drift to one side more than the other and then go back to its position. I would really like to learn more about this and I'm hoping we saw a piece of history being made. I also would like it if whoever runs this site can email me back with any information that they get about these mysterious red dots.;41.6125750000001;-87.8580163461539
Low, BRIGHT white light.;2017-02-12 18:37:00;30 seconds;Low, BRIGHT white light. HOLY COW!.. JUST NOW. 18:42 im reporting.. I just saw this thing!. went outside to smoke, ALWAYS look at the stars, have a pair of binocs in the garage. I looked at Cassiopeia, and from behind the evergreen tree, it was ? few degrees east of polaris when i spotted it. it was slow, not a comet, not a meteorite. no tails, and in Earths Atmosphere.. LOW. 1000-2000 ft??  a BRIGHT, NON BLINKING bright white light. It looked like a Star.. floating, heading East, South -East direction, I know Venus..or is it Jupiter in the West?.. on of the two, but this was BRIGHTER than that. .. i ran inside with my lit cigarette, grabbed my crappy camera,.. its ALL black on the screen.  I said DAD, theres a UFO floating East!  Got back as it was floating east still, but dimmer, Thought my camera was on pic mode, but it was on video mode,.. maybe someone can fiddle my settings,. but it was gone! about 8-10 seconds after i pointed my camera where it was going.. Blinked Away.., grabbed! the binocs, didnt see a thing!.. Lots of planes flying out that way now. Man, that was heart racing!,  sadly my dad cannot coreroborate my story. My camera still has the video.. if someone wants to email me.. feel free ..maybe you can do some magic...! WOW..God Bless! 1 Corinthians 4:3;41.6125750000001;-87.8580163461539
