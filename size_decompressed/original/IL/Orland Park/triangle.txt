Orland Park Illinois. July 4th 2003,triangular object right over fireworks;2003-07-04 08:30:00;15 minutes;Orland Park Illinois. July 4th 2003,triangular object right over fireworks My daughter and I were driving east on Interstate 80, between Gougar road and LaGrange road, going to a fireworks display, put on by The Village of Orland Park. We were running late, so we were looking north as I drove, in the direction of the fireworks, (approximately 2 mi. away), to see if they had already started.  We soon noticed a triangular pattern of lights, ( I think 5), traveling very slowly from east to west. It seemed like it started at the fireworks location, which is approximately 159th St,. and LaGrange Road. It was hard to determine what size the thing was, but seemed very large.  I was meeting my brothers at their office building where we usually sat on their roof to view the fireworks,(very close to them). I tried numerous times to contact them by cell phone, but to no avail. Either I couldn't get thru, or they were unable to hear their phones ringing.( Fireworks had yust started at that time).  My daughter and myself, upon exiting Interstate 80, at LaGrange Road, stopped on the top of the overpass, facing north and continued to watch this object till it was out of view, going west.;41.6125750000001;-87.8580163461539

LARGE TRIANGLE WITH VERY BRIGHT LIGHTS TRAVELING WEST FROM ORLAND PARK IL.;2006-07-04 22:00:00;unk;LARGE TRIANGLE WITH VERY BRIGHT LIGHTS TRAVELING WEST FROM ORLAND PARK IL. I WAS ON MY WAY TO WORK,  I HAD LEFT A 4TH OF JULY PARTY EARLY.   WHILE TRAVELING E. BOUND ON IL I-80 I SAW A LARGE TRIANGULAR OBJECT TO THE NORTHEAST OF MY LOCATION.  IT APPEARED TO HAVE A SERIES OF VERY BRIGHT LIGHTS ON THE FRONT 2 SIDES POINTED DIRECTLY AWAY FROM THE SURFACE ON WHICH THEY WERE MOUNTED, NOT DIRECTLY FOREWARD AS ON AIRCRAFT.   THE OBJECT WAS BANKING TO THE SOUTH AT LESS THAT 10 DEGREES.  I REMEMBER LOOKING AWAY VERY QUICKLY,  ALMOST LIKE MY ATTENTION WAS FORCED AWAY.  I STILL REMEMBER WANTING TO LOOK AT IT BUT STILL NOT DOING IT.   I COMPLETLEY FORGOT ABOUT THIS EVENT UNTIL I WAS DRIVING THE SAME ROUTE A FEW MONTHS LATER.  I HAVE A VAGUE MEMORY OF STANDING OUTSIDE OF MY TRUCK WATCHING THE OBJECT,  BUT ITS IS ALL VERY FUZZY.   THIS WAS IN A VERY POPULATED AREA.  IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT I WAS THE ONLY ONE TO SEE IT.   I WAS ON TIME FOR WORK THAT NIGHT SO I DO NOT SUSPECT MISSING TIME.   I AM A FORMER POLICE OFFICER AND POLICE CHIEF.;41.6125750000001;-87.8580163461539
