An X shaped object coming from south-west, hovering in sky and quickly left to the east.;2003-01-07 00:45:00;10 minutes;An X shaped object coming from south-west, hovering in sky and quickly left to the east. I was driving west on a main street through town, i noticed a large white light about 1 inch above the tree line to the left of me (south-west).  As i continued driving i noticed the light did not appearto move in any direction, but was very large in comparision to the stars/planets (a size of a penny to the stars, which i would put as the size of a pin point).  I drove several blocks and noticed it was moving in a slow, north/north-east direction, as i drove several more blocks it was now about one block to my south-west direction, about 100-150 feet above the houses in the area.  I was at an intersection of a stop light turning south (towards object) with another car, who was also stariung at th eobject.  At this close range i could see a definate shape,it was a X or cross shape with one set of wings larger then the other.  One set glowed red under while the smallers set was white.  At the tip of each wing was a white light.  The other car was watching with me for about 45 seconds and then drove quickly away.  I continued to watch the object which was almost stopped about 1/2 block directly in front of my car, still about 150 feet above the houses.  I stopped to watch it, it hovered for roughly 1 minute and proceeded directly east at a medium speed.  It seemed to be watching or looking at particular items.;41.6619;-87.7937
