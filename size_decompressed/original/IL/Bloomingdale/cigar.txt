Silent balloon shaped object;2003-12-31 08:00:00;3 minutes;Silent balloon shaped object I observed craft move from north to south at 45 degree angle. It was silent, white in color, apparently several thousand feet altitude, fairly large, moving at 200 or so miles per hour. The silence was the unusual thing. A balloon would make considerable noise, even at high altitude. And the craft was moving too fast for a balloon. As it got far past me to the south a notices that it rounded out in shape.;41.9462;-88.0758
