Bright,  light, bounces across the night sky.;2009-07-27 04:22:00;sporadic movement at diff;Bright,  light, bounces across the night sky. I was unable to sleep, so I went to bed rather late.  It was about 4 am that I decided to lay down.  I was staring out the window as I lied down on my pillow.  As I was staring out the window, I saw a tiny bright, white, light in the distance and thought it was a helicopter or a plane, but then it just all of a sudden just skipped across the sky in a bouncy fashion.  It went from the left side to the right, and then it zipped back to the left again and bounced behind the trees.   I woke up my husband who was lying right next to me and I said Oh my God! Did you see that?!  He sat right up and said, What?   I began to explain to him what had just happened and when I was explaining it to him we both were looking out the window, and saw the same light appear again and bounce behind the trees, and he said, I see it, I see it.  We stared intently out the window, but we couldn't make out what the shape was because it was zipping from side to side behind the trees.  It zipped to one side, and disappeared.  We then just stared, hoping we would see it again, and it made one more brief appearance, and then disappeared for good.;41.323;-89.2089
