Object in low lying cloud bank.;2015-10-24 20:30:00;5 minutes;Object in Low Lying Cloud Bank. Driving south on IL 130 north of Villa Grove IL.  Saw light in low lying clouds.  From a distance it appeared stationary.  I thought it was a light on top of a tower.   As I approached it, I noticed a farmer in his field working after dark.  The object was hovering above the farmer in a low lying cloud.  The object appeared to have two bright lights aiming north.  Although the object was hovering, it was also slowly moving northward.   It could have been a helicopter but if not, I have no idea what it was.  It was not a star, a planet, an airplane, or a jet.  I would have pulled over and watched it but I had my wife and kids in the car.  She told me to move my ass down the road.  She said I was going to get us all killed.  Always wanted to see a UFO.  I think I finally saw one and I didn't get to enjoy it.;39.8655;-88.1585
