Triangle shaped object  flying across the sky VERY FAST.;2003-09-22 09:15:00;2-3 sec;Triangle shaped object  flying across the sky VERY FAST. A very fast triangle shaped object colored red, blue and green flew across the sky. My aunt, in another town also saw a object fly across the sky around the same time that I saw a object fly across the sky. This ufo flew at an angle toward the horizon. From the time I saw the object to the time of disappearance it took about 2-3 sec to fly across the sky. VERY FAST.;42.099;-88.3702

Definetly wasn't a helicopter or a plane there was no other lights on besides the two small lights on the bottom.It was strange enough to make me jump back and fourth from my patio to inside my house.;42.099;-88.3702
