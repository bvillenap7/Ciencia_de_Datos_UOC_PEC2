Within a few minutes of observation the lights dissappeared. Within a minute or two the lights began flashing again a far distance from where they were 1st seen. The flashing lights were traveling North to South then they would turn around and travel South to North. At one point the lights stopped flashing however I was still able to make out a faded red glow from what ever it was traveling across the sky. This has gone on for over 1 hour when I seen a steady red light traveling West to East at a very fast speed, much faster than any jet at that hight, any jet I am familiar with that is. Within minutes I seen a steady white light traveling in the East from NorthWest to SouthEast. My wife 2 children, neighbor and wife and his 2 children all witnessed this. I even recorded this on my video recorder. The reason we were outside is we lost power from around 6:30 to around 8:30 or so. My family and neighbors were all outside with flashlights, that is why so many people witnessed this. I went outside and the lights are still circling above turning on and off several times... ((NUFORC Note:  The lights may have been navigation lights on military aircraft patrolling the skies over the U. S..  PD));41.6920760000001;-88.1001700000002
