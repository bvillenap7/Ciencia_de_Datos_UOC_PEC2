Lights went out on street. I was entering Boughton road off of Kings going east toward Naperville road and saw the UFO in the northeast sky and observed the street lights go out one at a time as I went past them.  The UFO had white flashing lights at the base and they seemed to be rotating around the base.  As I approached Canyon Dr. (one block west of Naperville road) I saw the UFO bank so that the base was upside down.  It picked up speed and disappeared in the northeast sky.  I was not afraid of the sighting. That night I dreamed about an implant being put into my right upper arm.  In the dream I was not afraid and the humanoid alien put the implant in was very friendly and I felt no pain.  The object in my arm was verified by three people, one of whom is my massage therapist who has worked with me twice a month for approx. two years. I am a Masters Degree level social worker.;41.6920760000001;-88.1001700000002

Looks like gas around it.  ((NUFORC Note:  If an AM sighting, possibly Sirus?  PD));2013-11-10 05:15:00;Unknown;Looks like gas around it. This about 6 times that we see it it stays in one place for about an hour then it leaves in a couple of seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the time of sighting may be flawed.  If it was an evening sighting, possibly a sighting of Venus in the southwest sky.  PD));41.6920760000001;-88.1001700000002
