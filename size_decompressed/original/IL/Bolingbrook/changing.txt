Clear night just finished looking at Mars through my telescope.  I was about to go inside when I looked up at the big dipper.  I saw a whitish/grayish half circle shape moving across the sky.   I thought it was birds and then all of a sudden the half circle straightened out to form two lines that were at a 45 degree angle.   The shape kept moving then the two lines concaved and kept moving forward.   Finally, the lines formed back to the original half circle shape and disappeared.

It looked like a silver orb and it was tumbling but then lights flickered brightly as it turned around over and over. Each time it rotated some bright lights flashed. At first I thought it was balloons but then I saw the lights and could see they weren't sun reflections.;41.6920760000001;-88.1001700000002
