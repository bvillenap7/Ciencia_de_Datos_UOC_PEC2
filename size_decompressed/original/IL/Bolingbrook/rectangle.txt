Imagine a picture of clear night sky in Photoshop.  Take a small rectangular section and move it across the picture.   At first, I had the impression it was an aircraft without the usual lights a plane has when flying at night.  The only lights on this object, or these objects, since I could only see one after I turned and lost sight momentarily halfway through the sighting, resembled a faint group of stars, similar to the Pleiades, but fainter.   Since it was obvious this was no ordinary aircraft I removed my headphones to listen and I heard nothing.  I followed it for a total of about 30 or 40 seconds before I lost sight of it.   This is how something would look if you wanted to camouflage an object to move through the night sky without being noticed.  I suspect some sort of military aircraft, but the lack of sound baffles me.   Anything with a normal propulsion system would have to be very high to be silent and if so, based on the area of the object(s) and the angular speed, it would have to be incredibly large and fast.;41.6920760000001;-88.1001700000002
