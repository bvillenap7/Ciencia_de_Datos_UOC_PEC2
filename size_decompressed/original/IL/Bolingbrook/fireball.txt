Red fireballs;2011-05-08 00:30:00;1 hour;Red fireballs I was watching tv when I noticed something out the corner of my eye tha looked like a plane at first, but after stepping outside to get a better look I was dumbstruck at what I saw.   The first time it passed it looked like a flickering flame in the sky that was moving a little faster than a plane and much larger than any star that was in the sky (tonight was a clear sky night).   I thought nothing of it and went back to watching tv and 15 minutes later I saw it again and this time ran outside to get to see it longer and more clearly.  It was again a red flickering fireball type object.   Another 25 minutes later it came again but this time I brought my stepbrother out to see it and at first when I told him he thought it was a meteor or something but after he saw it he agreed it was not that ora plane.  The object had no flashing lights that would indicate it being a plane and I could see no definate object. just the same red fireball moving in a straight line all three times.;41.6920760000001;-88.1001700000002
Fiery orb, traveling on SW vector from NE.;2012-07-08 21:52:00;4 minutes;Fiery orb, traveling on SW vector from NE. We viewed this orange fiery orb traveling on a southwest heading from the northeast.  They were traveling at a high rate of speed on a straight vector. The orb was at full brightness, magnitude ten.  The light was constant until it passed far down range and then it quickly dimmed to a magnitude 5 for about three seconds, than went back to ten, back to five and repeated this until it went out of site.   I have looked at every single aircraft I see in the sky, night and day, for twenty years and Iâ€™ve never seen anything like this.   I also am an amateur stargazer, and have watched satellites and iridium flares for years.  This was not like any of those.   It appeared to be in orbit, but was generating its own light.  It would have to be an iridium panel programmed to reflect the sun's light to our position but that would take a huge panel. It made no audible sound. I filled out a separate report on  our seeing two identical objects to this one on 07/04/2012 at approximately the same time on the same vector.;41.6920760000001;-88.1001700000002
3 fireballs moving upward in a vertical column;2013-07-03 22:00:00;1 minute;3 fireballs moving upward in a vertical column My wife & I were out in the backyard, enjoying a wonderful night.  I looked up and saw 3 bright fireballs in an almost vertical column.  My first thought was this was a firework of some sort, because the orbs were bright and flickering, but then I realized that they were much too high in the sky.  I noticed a normal airplane far off to the right and could compare the difference in movement and lights. I quickly realized I did not understand what I was seeing.  I called my wife over to look.  She too was could not explain what we were seeing. We were viewing in a westerly direction and seeing 3 bright fiery orbs orange/red color in a vertical column moving together, but not 100% synchronized, meaning I could see the distance between the orbs change (but not too drastically).   The lights appeared much brighter/larger then other lighted objects in the sky.  Also the column was not 100% perfect (at least from my vantage point).   I asked my wife to take some video with her phone (she did). After about 20 secs, the lights started to dim, but they were still visible.   The top 2 appeared to move higher and move very quickly in a north easterly direction.  The bottom orb also appeared to change altitude, but it went in a northerly direction.   I lost sight of them after about 1 minute. I have no idea what it was we saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness;41.6920760000001;-88.1001700000002
