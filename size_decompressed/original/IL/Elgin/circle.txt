A circular object with alternating flashing lights;1982-06-19 15:00:00;5 minutes;This was a long time ago and I never told anyone else but it has always been on my mind and now I want to share.  A circular object with alternating flashing lights hovered above a state ran facility in So Elgin Il for 5 minute. Sitting on the side of the road myself & my boyfriend at that time and about 9 others standing watching,  This craft slowly came across the highway and stopped above the Mental Health Facility and just sat there,  Other drivers just passed by like they could see nothing,   It made no sounds, it left the facility slowly then as it rose up it quickly gained speed and was gone in an instant.  My only regret was I had no camera.  Am unsure of date.  ((NUFORC Note:  Date indicated is approximate.  PD));42.0357601626016;-88.3122008130081
Saw a black stationary orb in the sky in Elgin.  ((anonymous report));2018-09-01 17:00:00;>2 minutes;Saw a black stationary orb in the sky in Elgin. I was at work and was told to go out and grab shopping carts.  We had a storm coming and there were big dark clouds in the sky but it was still daylight out, so what I saw was clear.  As I was grabbing a cart from the very back reaches of the parking lot, I looked up and saw in the sky a black sphere-like object in the distance.  It wasn't moving up or down, further or closer it was completely still.  And it was right by a rain cloud,so it couldn't have been a helicopter or plane.  It was close enough where I could tell it was only a black object that was completely stationary.  If it were anything else I was close enough to tell any details that would make it anything different.  I stood and stared at it for a minute or two, but I was working so I couldn't watch it for any longer so I'm not sure if it disappeared or flew away.  For all I know, it's still there.  I doubt it, though I will make another report if I see it again soon. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
