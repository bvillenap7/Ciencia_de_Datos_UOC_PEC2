Twinkling, firely light surrounded by or in front a red circular shape moved across the sky before hovering and dissappearing.;2010-05-31 22:10:00;5 minutes;Twinkling, firely light surrounded by or in front a red circular shape moved across the sky before hovering and dissappearing. We saw an object in the sky which consisted of a twinkling star-like light, yellow in color, with a red circle/oval behind (around?) it.  The object looked to be extremely high up and moved quickly across the sky in an indirect way (the flight pattern was not in a line), curved around, and then hovered before seemingly moving upward, fading, and dissappearing.

Fireball in sky separating into two!;2011-07-04 22:45:00;15 min.;Fireball in sky separating into two! On the way home from a firework display, a large bright orange ball in the sky caught my eye.  Looking at it, it seemed too bright to be lights from a plane, planet or other things you might find in the sky.  The object seemed to be moving, and moving fast.   After a few minutes of intense brightness it seemed to be fading, blending in with the others stars but still keeping itâ€™s orange color, still traveling it seemed to change direction a few times before disappearing completely.   After a minute or so of searching the sky it returned just as bright and big but in a different location.  This object was also moving, but not as quickly.  After another minute or so it brightened and got larger and another fireball fell from it, traveling down to the ground as fast as you would expect something to fall.   After the second fireball fell from the original, the original light disappeared and soon after, the second light also disappeared but behind trees and houses.   I recorded the two balls separating on camera and it truly does look like a fire in the sky but seems too high and constant to be so.   Freaky.;42.0357601626016;-88.3122008130081

9:00pm CST, 9/4/16, fireball-like objects observed over Elgin, IL.;2016-09-04 21:00:00;Few minutes;9:00pm CST, 9/4/16, fireball-like objects observed over Elgin, IL, Just after 9:00pm Central time last night (Sept 4), my husband and I saw 3 glowing orange fireball-like objects moving swiftly across the night sky from the south/southeast to the north/northwest.  They were about 30 seconds apart, about 40 degrees above the horizon, followed the same path and did not make a sound.  We are absolutely certain they were not commercial airliners, as there were no blinking wingtip or tail lights or jet engine noise. Furthermore, a short time after seeing the three fireball objects, two commercial airliners were seen and heard passing overhead .... going from north to south (the opposite direction of the fireball objects).  A short time later, two move fireball-like objects were seen, again with no blinking lights or jet engine sound. Again, they were about 30 seconds apart and traveling in a southern to northern path.;42.0357601626016;-88.3122008130081
