White lights with blue and red flashing lights around it;2006-08-22 22:30:00;30 minutes;White lights with blue and red flashing lights around it The object was a bright white light with blue and red flashing lights.  The random flashing of the lights was continual.  The object moved left/right and up/down and seemed to stay in the same general area while actually it was moving downward out of our line of vision.;42.0357601626016;-88.3122008130081
bright white ball of  light moving fast and smooth and silent;2011-11-01 22:15:00;20 -30 seconds;bright white ball of  light moving fast and smooth and silent I was sitting next to my huge great room windows. I looked outside, it was dark, 1015pm, and all of a sudden a large bright white light came over my house, moving at such a speed and so smooth.  It moved away from me but continued to be a very bright white ball of light,moving in a northwesterly direction.  I knew it wasn't a plane as when I watch planes come they seem to move so slow sometimes you think they arent even moving.  No noise was discernable, like a helicopter is unmistakeable.  Also it was moving away from me and the light did not change in shape or size.;42.0357601626016;-88.3122008130081
