Triangle of lights in the sky to the south.;2016-04-06 23:14:00;15 minutes;Triangle of lights in the sky to the south. I walked out my back door to bring in my grilling tools to wash them, and noticed a large triangle shape in the sky to the south.  It was formed by 3 bright white lights on each tip of the triangle.  It was really hard to tell how high up it was, but seemed to be large. There was zero noise heard at all.  The lights were not flashing, and they weren't shimmering like stars, just bright steady white lights.  There was a tree right next to were I spotted them and using the tree for reference they WERE moving slowly towards the NE.   I came back just 12-15 minutes later, and they were no place to be seen anyplace in the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
