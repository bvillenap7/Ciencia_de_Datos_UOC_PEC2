I took picture,  however only the UFO is clearly in the picturte I was unable to locate the Airplane.  I know I took a picture of both at the same time.;42.0357601626016;-88.3122008130081
Four orange/reddish objects seen and video taped;2008-07-04 21:30:00;7 minutes;Four orange/reddish objects seen and video taped My family and I were watching the fireworks from my backyard when one of us noticed a strange orange/reddish glowing object from the north coming south, towards us.  It was about one half to a mile in the sky and was moving at a good pace.  The object was approximately 20 X 20 (feet) and appeared to be circular.  We didn’t think much of the object until it started getting closer and we began to eliminate the possible answers as to what this object could be.  The object didn’t give off any engine noise and didn’t have any flashing lights on it.  The object flew very straight.  It made a sharp right turn and headed west at the same rate of speed and altitude.  That’s when I ran in the house to get my camera. When I returned to the backyard, the third object has appeared from the north, almost coming from the exact same place as the first one.  This one flew in the exact same path as the first one, and according to my other family members, as the second one as well.   I started video taping the object and was able to get a close up of it with my Sony video camera as it moved towards us and to the west.  This is when I could see the object was disc shaped.  Just as the third object was moving out of sight – the forth object appeared.  I was able to get some good video of the forth one as well.  All four objects followed the exact same flight pattern, speed, and altitude - traveling from north to west and traveling until we couldn’t see them any longer.  There were seven adults and my two children that witnessed this event, including an off duty police officer.  We still can’t come up with a logical explanation as to what occurred that night.  One other person in my family was able to get video of one of the objects with his camera as well.  A number of my neighbors saw the objects as well.;42.0357601626016;-88.3122008130081
