Firey orange orb seen in sky over Elgin, Illinois;2010-05-31 22:10:00;3 min;Firey orange orb seen in sky over Elgin, Illinois We were driving home, in Elgin, Il. on Larkin Ave.  Looked up and saw this orange flaming sphere shaped object in the sky, it looked like a plane on fire.  We pulled over onto Aldine Ave, 10:10 p.m. Got out of the car and watched it fly across the sky it didn't seem to have a flight pattern, it slowed down, it's movement was kind of jiggly and then hovered.  It seemed to have an arc shaped sail or wing on it, like if you were looking up into a hot air balloon and saw the glowing shape of the balloon thru the fire.  After hovering for a bit it started moving again and increased speed upward into the sky.  We knew it moved up, it got smaller as it went and finally disappeared.  It move across the sky towards the horizon, it went up.  We did not hear any sounds or a sonic boom when it disappeared.   After that we watched a plane fly across the sky for comparison, and it was not a plane of any sort, or a helicopter or balloon.;42.0357601626016;-88.3122008130081
10  bright orange noiseless spheres flew over head in single file at intrevals of 10 to 15 seconds moving from S to N.;2010-07-02 22:00:00;5 min;10  bright orange noiseless spheres flew over head in single file at intrevals of 10 to 15 seconds moving from the south to the north On Friday July 2nd at 10pm I first notice 2 bright orange lights coming up from the southern horizon one following the other in single fine heading north in a straight line, first seeming to move slow about the speed of a small plane but as they approached me going almost directly over head the speed would increase, we did not hear engine noise of any kind.  It's hard to judge altitude of things in the sky but they were not as high as a commercial airliner flying transcontinental and not as low as air traffic around O'hare, my guess is between 7 and 10 thousand feet.  The Objects appeared to be sphere shaped, orange light with possibly red at the top of the object, the lights did not blink, steady but not brillant.   As the first 2 came toward us we saw anothe coming up from the southern horizon in the same path as the first 2,they were about 10 to 15 seconds apart and took about 1 minute to come into view and then disappear to the north.   We then saw a fourth then a fifth coming in exactly the same line as the others, then came 6 and 7 coming but these 2 were side by side going exactly the same speed staying even with each other all the way across the sky. After those two the last 3 came at a longer intrevals but all in the same line of flight as the others appearing to move slow then gaining speed as the were over head. the last one made a small arcing move to the west then corrected and went north northeast.   I tried to video the event but I didn't realize that my girlfriends video was set on multi media so I only got 27 seconds of video of me trying to locate the objects in the veiw finder. The later objects I located but alas no video running at the time. I'm hoping somebody else saw these objects like we did and can help shed some light on what they might be.;42.0357601626016;-88.3122008130081
Silent redish orange fire like spheres/ orbs ( 5 )  following the direction of the wind blowing 1-2 k feet high;2013-03-30 21:30:00;15 minutes;Silent redish orange fire like spheres/ orbs ( 5 )  following the direction of the wind blowing 1-2 k feet high Around 9:30 PM ( 22:30 PM ) in Elgin, Illinois I was walking my dog when I noticed two reddish orange fire like orbs/ spheres traveling in the night sky. At first I didn’t pay much attention until they seemed to be on a path of  possible impact, they were too close to be typical aircraft as we live 30 minutes from an international airport and I am very familiar with normal air traffic patterns.  Once the objects were directly over head they made no noise of any kind.  They were completely silent, again eliminating the possibility of typical normal aircraft.  Soon after they passed over 2 other orbs/ spheres appeared and also followed the same path.  Once they disappeared, a final orb/ sphere also followed and soon disappeared.  The unidentified flying objects seemed to move at the speed and direction of the wind’s blowing, traveling from southwest to northeast.  When directly overhead it looked like there might be a canopy or parachute above the glowing light, but I am not 100% sure of that.;42.0357601626016;-88.3122008130081
