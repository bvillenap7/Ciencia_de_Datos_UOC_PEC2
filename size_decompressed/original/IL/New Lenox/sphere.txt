Huge glowing orange sphere over New Lenox IL seen by 4 witnesses;2012-07-10 22:15:00;5 minutes;Huge glowing orange sphere over New Lenox IL seen by 4 witnesses From my back patio, I witnessed a huge glowing orange ball come over my house, I called my 2 daughters and one of their friends outside.  We watched this glowing orange ball climb higher in the sky going south for about 4-5 minutes and then it shot out of sight with in seconds.   I can't even begin to describe what it compares to other than a huge flying glowing orange sphere.  We did catch part of it on an IPhone video but there is no point of reference in the sky to gauge the size in the video.   I have never witnessed anything like this in my entire life.  It was definitely way larger than a helicopter and made no sound.  The orange glowing color seemed to rotate or orbit around the sphere. I have no words....;41.5067;-87.9631
