I was driving down I-80 west bound towards the New Lenox exit.  I saw a light come down from the sky towards the ground but not fast like a meteor.  The light was so visible that all the cars and trucks around me hit their brakes to watch this thing land come down.  I knew I was not the only one to see this.   I think it landed somewhere south of Rt 30 East of Exit 137 off of I-80.   Quite impressed by this I never reported something of this nature before.  Since I saw everyone else step on their brakes to look at it, I decided to put up a report.;41.5067;-87.9631
