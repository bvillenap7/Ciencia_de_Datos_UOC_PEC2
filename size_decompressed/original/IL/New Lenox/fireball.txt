Red -Orange object in early evening sky;2008-07-05 21:00:00;20 min;Red -Orange object in early evening sky We witnessed an object in the evening sky moving south to north just after dusk.  It appeared to be a satellite at first, yet much brighter then I’ve ever seen.  It was red-orange in color and moving far slower then a satellite.  It crept on it’s course for over 10 minutes until it reached the lower star in the big dipper.   At that point it changed direction and began moving more north-easterly in direction until it disappeared from view after another 5-10 minutes. It did not move erratically and only changed direction just one time.  It was very high and had no flashing lights.  I would have believed it to be a satellite except for the slow speed and the change of direction. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

I was outside watering flowers after returning from dinner and a show and observed 3 fireball objects passing in a southwesterly direction.   I called my husband to witness and he took pictures of several more passing overhead.   We are retired professionals in good mental health.;41.5067;-87.9631
