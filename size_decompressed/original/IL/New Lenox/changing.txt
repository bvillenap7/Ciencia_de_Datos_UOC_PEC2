Both objects were stationary in the sky, one a very bright yellow and and the other a bright blue. They were probably less than a mile apart from each other.  Each object was not moving and it was easy to tell they were not planes because several planes were flying nearby them.  They both would become more/less intense in brightness at certain times and seemed to be diamond shaped.  The blue colored one appeard to be flickering heavily and very noticebly changing colors from red, blue, green, yellow, etc.. at one point the object appeared to come apart into about 4 separate points of light and then returned together after about 5 seconds.  After watching each object for about 40 minuted we ended up running home to grab binoculars and when we returned the yellow one was gone and the blue one seemed to be further aw! ay.  Looking through the binoculars it was clear to see colores dancing around on the object and it appeared to be flashing and rotating.  After another 40 minutes it was much further away and we left the area.  My girlfriend who thought I was nuts for believing in some kind of extraterrestrial occurances was completely blown away and now is a very interested and intrigued by the subject.;41.5067;-87.9631
