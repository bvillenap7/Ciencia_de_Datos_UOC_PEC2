White light moveing fast and out of normal flight patterns.;2014-02-13 18:00:00;1-5 minutes;White light moveing fast and out of normal flight patterns. I was sitting in the car facing the east. I had seen a white light far away behind the clouds. It was like seeing a normal aircraft.  Except it was moveing fast especially for being so far away. I lost sight of it at times because of the clouds.  Then saw it in another spot in a completley wrong flight of path for any of our known aircraft.  It would move in another direction and it would jump around.  It wasn't because of the clouds.  The clouds were moving and not even there at some points.;40.9896;-88.8811
