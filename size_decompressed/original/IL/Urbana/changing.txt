But upon accelleration a round  object appeared at the front of the contrail 11/27 99 3:30 P.M. to 5:00 P.M. From my sixth floor Apartment window facing due west, and without any obstructed view, I observed the formation of contrails in the southwestern skies. They were flying at high altitudes and moving from west to east and east to west. Later others started to form from north to south making a matrix in the southwestern sky neat the setting sun. I noticed two very short contrails that were changing speeds and at times stopped in mid air and changed direction these contrails appeared as right angle slashes and could have easily gone unnoticed as they blended in with the whispy clouds. I observed them moving under independant control! They seemed to be able to lengthten or shorten the contrail emission. I also observed jet aircraft flying toward these objects. The objects would change postions when the aircraft was remotely near them. One object seemed to park in a postion facing the setting sun. The other was further west from the sun and was also parked for a good bit of the time. A jet flew toward its postion at a higher altitude. It took off from its stationary position in a 90o angle to the south west. Then it accellerated leaving a long dark colored contrail( all other contrails were white) behind it. When it accellerated I could clearly see a round reflective object at the head of the contrail. Its speed seemed very fast. Much faster than any of the other movement I saw. Then I decided I should try to report it.;40.0950351063829;-88.1945648936169
