Each winter, after ice has formed on my pond, I begin to observe holes in the ice.  I have discussed this with any number of people and sought adise from interested people.  I have visited at least one web site in the North east, I belive who reported this occurance.  I began photographing the holes as they appear and have recorded  at least a dozen or more.  Friends postulate that perhaps deer have fallen through the ice, and I have recorded those events.  What seems strange to me is that the ice is several inches thick and the holes are of different sizes and in different locations on the pond.  I have inquired of people living near by who have ponds, only one person observed such hole but attributed the events to deer falling into the ponds. If I were to hazard a gues as to the ballistic nature of these occurances, it seems that a low flying plane would have dropped a bowling ball onto the ice.  Some holes are small, 4 or 5 inches in diamiter, some are 8 to 10 inches.   Peolpe from the university's goelogical survey suggested warm springs causing the holes, but that seemed difficult to accept.;40.0950351063829;-88.1945648936169
