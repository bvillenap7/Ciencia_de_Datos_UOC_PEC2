Silver Metalic cylinder over Urbana;1998-06-30 13:00:00;seconds;Silver Metalic cylinder over Urbana In the late 90’s I was home one day while a workman was making repairs to the roof of my home.  I needed to run an errand so, as I was leaving, I stopped to ask the roofer if he needed anything before I left. It was early afternoon during the summer.  There were no clouds in the sky. As I stood in the driveway looking up at the roofing contractor, I saw a featureless metallic silver cylinder with rounded ends glide by overhead.  There were no wings, windows, lights or visible seams. There was no trail or exhaust.  It moved in a straight path at a constant rate of speed and was completely silent. The roofing contractor was on the roof looking down at me so did not see it.  To this day I don’t know why I didn’t point and ask, What the heck is that? to the roofing contractor, but for some reason I just watched it glide by overhead.
