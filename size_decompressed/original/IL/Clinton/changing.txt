((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witnesses might have observed the object that was reported from all over the eastern U. S. on the night of Tuesday, March 15, 1995.  It was a very dramatic series of sightings, which stretched from Virginia to Missouri, and which occurred over a very short period of time, perhaps as little as 10-15 minutes.  This is one of the cases that I feature in the NUFORC public presentation, which is accompanied by photographic slides.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));40.1492;-88.9685
