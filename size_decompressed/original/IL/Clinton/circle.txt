Daylight causing blue orb in Illinois;1996-06-15 21:00:00;30-45 secs;Daylight causing blue orb in Illinois This is a really old incident but I was hoping to hear that one of the many cars on the highway 51 reported anything... I KNOW they to saw what me and my husband saw...the date is fuzzy it might of even been in 95. I didnt tell many people what we saw for fear of being called a fake.  Me and my husband at the time were driving home from dropping off my son in Pontiac Il, we drove there every other weekend for visitation. This night me and my husband were having an arguement and I leaned on my passenger side door to pout, looking out into nowhere. I was startled by a BRIGHT NEON blue orb? Round. Pretty light. Then after it had both of our attention, not that we spoke a word, it turned off I just starred toward it wondering what was that? Then it turned on again..and I said WOAH....Then while he and I both watched it, it just went daylight...seriously...I have read a little about some phenomenas but they just dont match up to what we saw that night, It was daylight as far as the eye could see. I guess that isnt as exciting as being taken to a mother ship, but if you experienced it-it would be a life altering moment. Then after it looked like daylight it was a blue orb again and then poof it was gone. That was it. I just wish someone else would of called and made the big deal about it, that I was wanting to do...but was to afraid.  Mrs G ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.
