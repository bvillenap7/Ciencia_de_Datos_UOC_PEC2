At 11 on Saturday night I was sitting by a fire when, out of the corner of my right eye I saw the sky light up a bit.  At first I believed what I was seeing was simply a shooting star until the blue/green object shifted directions diagonally and zoomed over my head and disappeared.  I saw the object for about 5 seconds total, and it moved very quickly so I am not sure of the exact shape, but I do know what I saw was unlike anything I have seen before.;40.8873;-88.4097
