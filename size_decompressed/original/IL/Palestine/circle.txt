When she looked up there was a orange-yellow glowing circle object in the night sky.  It was being chased by at least 6 fighter jets.  She said, if you compare the size of the UFO to the jets.  The jets would be the size of the lead end of a pencil and the UFO would be the size of a half dollars.  She actually saw the UFO being fired upon by the jets and returning fire.  Then the UFO quickly disappeared to the west. There was 3 other people present all of them saw the same scene.  The older 2 people are in there Seventies and said they had never seen anything like it before and where very surprised almost to the point of shock.;38.9952;-87.6166
