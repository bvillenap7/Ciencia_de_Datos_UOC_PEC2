Daytime star.;2011-07-23 17:00:00;1 hour;daytime star I was outside watching the clouds and having a glass of wine when I noticed a bright flash of silver/white light above the western horizon.  The flash of light became just a ball of light that looked like a small star in the broad daylight.  I tried to get my friend to see it but it was gone before I could get him to focus on it.   About an hour later I saw the same white/silver ball of light in the exact same spot and then it faded out and never saw it again.  I have never seen anything like this and it was not an airplane as there were some airplanes leaving contrails as the went by and this object moved very quickly but made no sound.;40.0849;-91.3732
