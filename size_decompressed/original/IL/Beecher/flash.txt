Flash of light, saucer, into another flash of light;2008-08-01 00:20:00;1 second;Flash of light, saucer, into another flash of light I was sitting on a picnic table at approx. 12.20 AM at my work in Beecher, Il, scanning the horizon, and I saw what looked like a mortar blast about 500 Yards off of the prarieland behind the plant. It was white in the center with a bluish tint surrounding it. A concave, bright white object appeared out of it and headed from north to south at about a 20 degree decent. The object dissapeared into the aforementioned mortar blast about 6 inches (from my viewpoint of the horizon), the mortar blast appearing when the object came within about 1/16th of an inch from the mortar blast. It seemed to be some sort of warp, I've seen plenty of meteor showers, and this was just too damn close to the horizon line to call it that, and definately too bright to be some sort of space debris burning up in the atmosphere. The angle of decent is also what made me question it.I've never experienced anything like this before. Please give me some information as to what this occurrance was, any feedback would be greatly appreciated.  I was working with a crew of 7 4 outside, one other witness.  Thank you for your time, I will report to your hotline when I get the time today.  Also, could this have any corrolation with the eclipse today?;41.3456;-87.6071
