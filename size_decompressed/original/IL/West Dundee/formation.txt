I was walking in my back yard, letting my dog out and getting some firewood.  I looked up to see how the stars looked on this cool crisp night when I noticed what appeared to be a flock of lit birds...but turned out to be a string of lights, approximately 1/3 high up in the sky.  If I had to guess less than 1,000 ft up.   My dog began barking but other than that the sky was dead quiet.  The 6 lit objects almost looked like stars but were a dull orange or pink tone and moved in perfect unison.  This could have been one object.  The object moved from West to East at a slow but steady pace.   I have tried to think about all possible alternatives and ratonalizing this but cannot determine what this is.  It definitely was not a natural occurrance and has shaken me.;42.0992;-88.2927
