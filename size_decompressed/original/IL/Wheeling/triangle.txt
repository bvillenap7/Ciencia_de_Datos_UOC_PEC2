Strange flashing motionless object suddenly speeds away.;2009-08-19 12:28:00;2 minutes;Strange flashing motionless object suddenly speeds away. I was in my truck, and i was laying in the back. i looked out the window and saw a very bright light in the sky. I then thought that it was just a star, but it was flashing lights.  Then i thought it was a plane. It wasn't moving and was just sitting there.  I took out my phone and took a picture.  I got one good picture of a triangle looking shaped object.  I then got out and it Sped away.  It was super fast when it left. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));42.1358;-87.9427
Triangular craft with dark red globular lights observed 11/23/18 @17:15 CT in Wheeling, IL, for 10 sec. alongside Illinois I-9.4;2018-11-23 17:15:00;~10 seconds;Triangular craft with dark red globular lights observed 11/23/18 @17:15 CT in Wheeling, IL for 10 seconds alongside Illinois I-94 I am a retired ex-IT professional (15+ years, degreed, ex-ACM member). I was northbound on Illinois I-94 at approx. 5:15pm CT, near the Dundee exit, in/near Wheeling, IL.  Traffic was fairly heavy, I kept to the right-hand lane.  Initially, a white semi- ahead of me appeared to be having difficulty staying in the lane, drifting onto the shoulder every so often I remained substantially behind him for a mile or so, eventually he pulled onto the shoulder.  [It occurred to me later that perhaps he'd also seen the UFO and was dumbfounded or panicked and might be communicating via CB.]  Shortly thereafter, I glanced to my right and observed a triangular craft for several seconds, solid black against the night sky, with very large globular (warning?) lights at the apices, these emitting a fairly bright but dark red glow [Wikipedia: approx. 650? nm], easily seen against the night sky.  The form appeared to be equilateral, with no reflective qualities impossible to gauge its dimensions.  I could not discern any sound. My velocity was approx. 55mph the object appeared almost stationary but seemed to be traveling southbound because of it's orientation, i.e. it was 'pointed' southward, and seemed to be paralleling the highway.  I have been attempting to guesstimate its size -- at best I'd say its elevation was 100 to 150 feet and perhaps 100 to 150 feet on a side, but I could be off significantly, there were no reference points.  What astonished me most was the size of the globular 'lights', they were quite large, possibly the diameter of a quarter held two feet away, so that the distance between a fore- and aft- light may have been 20-25 such diameters? [conjecture]  I lost sight of it after perhaps 10 seconds of travel I did not have time (and did not think) to attempt photographing it with my cellphone... Recognition was immediate [have been a Coast fan for 20 years and am familiar with Peter's reports of similar craft].  I was astonished at the circumstantial nature of this sighting and uttered a few choice expletives, never having thought I'd actually see one of these.  I felt...vindicated in a sense, and quite excited, being a firm believer in such phenomena given the massive evidence available.;42.1358;-87.9427
