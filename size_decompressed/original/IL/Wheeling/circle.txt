A flare like object shot into the sky, then started moving to the right.;2017-03-05 05:10:00;5-10 minutes;A flare like object shot into the sky, then started moving to the right. After pulling an all nighter, on march fifth, 2017, at 5 in the morning, my friend, his little brother and I had decided to go for a walk to a nearby park.  While on the asphalt path leading up to the park, we saw an orange colored glowing circle shoot up.  We had immediately assumed that it was a flare, and contemplated calling the police in case someone was lost in a forest, but the direction it was coming from was by a more populated area of our city.  The glow seemed to get bigger, then smaller.  We stood there, watching it out of curiosity.   Then, it started moving.  My friend and I started recording with our phones, and then began running home.  It seemed to come a little bit towards us, then, my phone shut down while on 15%, which it had never done before or after.  By the time my phone finally turned on again, the UFO was to far away to be visible on my camera.  But my friend still had his footage.   We woke up his father and told him about what happened, but re! alized we couldn't show him the footage do to language the three of us used in shock.  But we still had the footage.  I told my dad about the experience and he told me I needed to get some sleep.  We talked about it the next day, but primarily focused on other things since then.  One day, a month and a half later, I learned that my friend's phone had suddenly stopped working.  I found this strange, especially because it was only a year and a half old.  Since then, I didn't think much of it, until today, when I decided to share my experience with the world. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
