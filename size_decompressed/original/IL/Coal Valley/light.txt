Ball of Light Moving at Extreme Speeds;2008-02-13 18:15:00;1 Minute;Ball of Light Moving at Extreme Speeds I saw what appeared to be a ball of light above some trees.  I figured it was an airplane because we live next to the Quad City Airport.  However, as I entered a clearing between the trees I found that this object was moving at an extreme rate of speed.  It so happens that there was another airplane in the sky at the time and this object flew by the airplane like it was standing still.  My first thought was that maybe it was a fighter plane....but there was no sound and it was moving 2-3 times the speed of a fighter plane.  Second, I thought maybe a shooting star or meteorite.  Just as the object was disappearing into the horizon it shot straight upward.  So much for the shooting star or meteorite theory.  I have no idea what that thing was.  I've never seen anything like it before.  All I know is that it freaked me out!;41.4385;-90.4658
