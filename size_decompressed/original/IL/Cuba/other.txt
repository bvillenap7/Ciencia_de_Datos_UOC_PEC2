I remember that day very clearly, it’s a day I won’t forget.  My husband and I live out in the country and there are several Amish communities in our area.  Also there’s a small town called Cuba about 7 minutes away from our house.  It was on a cool night of April 2018, I had to be up early for work the next day so I took my four year old son to his dads house in Cuba.  The sun had just set, it must have been 7:30-8p.m.  On my way home from dropping my son off, I had just left Cuba.  I was driving down the highway there are trees, fields, and Amish houses here and there. I get about a mile from my gravel road I need to turn on and I look up and there are two dark V shaped UFOs, similar to a boomerang, hovering over the Amish Bakery and their house.  There were a bunch of white lights on the under sides of the UFOs.  They weren’t moving at all, I didn’t hear any noises coming from them and they were both probably as wide as a small house.  I can tell you that my mouth! was wide open the whole time.  I couldn’t even think!  I was just so amazed.  There were two cars in front of me and I’m not sure if they saw them or not.  I pull onto my gravel road I get my phone out and put my vehicle in reverse.  I was going back to record them.  They must have saw me turn around because they started to drift away.  I wasn’t able to get any pictures.  My husband was at work when I got home,  I was home within minutes after the UFO sighting.  I was home by myself and I was absolutely terrified that they would come find me because of what I saw.  Thankfully they did not! I even texted a co-worker to let her know what I saw so that if I went missing she would know. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD);40.4955;-90.1804
