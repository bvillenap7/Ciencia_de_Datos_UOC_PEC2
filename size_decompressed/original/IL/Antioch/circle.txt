Large circular charcoaled grey object spotted in Northern Illinois;2005-03-18 13:00:00;2 MIN;Large circular charcoaled grey object spotted in Northern Illinois On Friday, March 18th 2005 in the afternoon while looking in the sky with my 18 month old daughter to spot birds,I saw an object in the sky moving at the rate of an airplane.  The object looked like a charcoaled grey ball floating across the sky.  It produced no sound.  I was shocked and ran to get my binoculars to get a closer look but when I returned the object was gone.  I ran outside and searched the sky in the front and back of my home and there was no sight of it and again, no sound.;42.4655;-88.1162000000001
