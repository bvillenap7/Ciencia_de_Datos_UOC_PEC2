Odd object moving at a high rate of speed.;2013-09-01 18:50:00;1.5 seconds;Odd object moving at a high rate of speed. I was taking photos trying to get photos of lightning strikes on the evening of 09/01/2013. I took over 330 photos this evening.  When I took the memory card out of the camera, and was going through the photos, I found 2 photos that recorded an object going across a clearing in the sky. the object came from behind the clouds and went back in behind the clouds in a straight line, but at a Very rapid rate.  I was taking photos in Burst mode, which for my camera is 10 frames per second on idea conditions.  I have 4 photos. One photo before the object time stamped at 6:50:58 pm, next frame with the object timestamped at 6:50:58 pm, next frame with the object time stamped at 6:50:59 pm, and next frame without the object time stamped at 6:50:59 pm.  The object in the photos looks like it is bow tie shape.  The lens I'm using was an 18-55mm F3.5-5.6 SAM. ISO 1600, Lens setting was 18mm, F3.5, shutter speed 1/40th of a second.;42.4655;-88.1162000000001
