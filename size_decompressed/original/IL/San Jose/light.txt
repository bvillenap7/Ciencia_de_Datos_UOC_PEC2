Sighting of 5 or 6 orange lights in the sky.;1992-11-15 18:30:00;3-4 minutes;Sighting of 5 or 6 orange lights in the sky I was listening to an ex cop describing seeing around 150 orange lights in the sky on Rense from a few nights ago. The size, color and movement of them is exactly what my wife and I saw when we came home from the election polls in Nov.1992.   Only, we only saw 5 or 6 of them.   Duration of several minutes. At the time I called area airports and they had no idea what we saw so they gave me a UFO reporting number to call. I did.  The next night they called me back and said they usually don't follow up on each report, but an hour after I reported it they had nearly 100 reports from the Chicago area. They asked if I held a dime at arms length if it would cover them.  I said yes they were quite a bit smaller than that. They told me someone from the Peoria, IL office would be calling me too.  But they never did. Only UFO sighting I've ever had but there was no mistaking it.;40.3011;-89.6872
