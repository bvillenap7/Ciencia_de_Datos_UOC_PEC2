Flying very erratically, almost looked like they were playing tag or dodge ball. (Not staying in formation) It lasted while we drove 5 miles, then one by one blinked out. These craft were far enough away that a dime held at arms length would cover them,individually, not their formation,  but they were quite visible in a clear, night-time, fall sky. They were orange in color and moved vertically and horizontally in an instant. I called the Springfield, IL airport to report it and they gave me a number to call, which I did and left a message. A few days later, my call was returned and I was asked what I'd seen again. I told them and they told me that and hour or two after my report over 300 reports, identical to mine, came in from the Chicago area. They said that someone else would contact me shortly. But nobody ever did. About a week later, my wife, her sister, my brother-in-law and I were in Peoria, IL at a luau by the IL River. We were right in town along the river when we saw the same thing my wife and I saw election night. Only this time, the duration was 5-6 hours and we also saw them flying slow and low above us (Without lights) Unlighted they were silvery in color and we could see them in the glow from the lights of Peoria. There was absolutely no sound on either occurrance.;40.3011;-89.6872
