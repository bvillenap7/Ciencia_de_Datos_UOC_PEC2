On the right is an animal clinic in the field to the left of their building above a small field was a oval light bright blue with a red dome. Husband turned around I saw it above some trees bottom was bright white tipped slightly so I could see abit of red and blue lights. We stopped we got out looked south and the back end was a large white light.  When I first saw it it was beautiful full color, but there was a small white flash I wonder if it had trouble.  Hovering.It took us 20 seconds to turn around and it had just made it to the tree line of this small railroad ravine.20 mph? After stopping and watching the white light go south we feel it kicked it up to maybe 45mph still low just above tree height. Full moon, wind out of North East. Radio station in Springfield had no reports, Channel 20 Springfield had no reports and I think they were abit amused. Went and scouted area this morning and it amazed me just how close it really was.  After went to minimart and asked if any one had seen it but no luck. Learned a valuable lesson always have my phone with camera with me because you never know.  Plan on being near tonight just in case a return. and one more thing.  The UFO was so colorful and bright you could not see any structure non at all no sound absolutely amazing.  I've always thought they live by 3 rules number 1 don't get caught 2 they are big showoffs and 3 let's mess with the humans and see if we can't get get them good and rattled..Going to make some phone calls to see if farther north anything was reported.;40.3011;-89.6872
