White/yellow ball of light, started bright, faded out as it came closer to the surface.;2017-09-20 06:53:00;30 seconds;White/yellow ball of light, started bright, faded out as it came closer to the surface. White/yellow ball of light that started high in the sky and slowly moved down toward earth.  Did not land.  Faded out slowly as it got closer.  No blinking, just a steady bright light until it faded out.  Looked almost like a plane in holding, but it was nowhere near the airport.;40.5093;-88.9844
