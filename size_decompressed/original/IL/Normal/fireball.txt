another fireball on 11/16/99;1999-11-16 18:00:00;30 seconds;another fireball on 11/16/99 I was leaving Krogers, I just happened to look up in the sky, and coming towards me, just what seemed like a few hundred feet above was this fireball with a green head, the tail was long and looked like gold glitter.  It travelled straight across the sky for several city blocks before I lost sight of it.  It was so weird because it travelled so low.;40.5093;-88.9844
