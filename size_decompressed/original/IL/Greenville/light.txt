They light up the entire night sky as if God was using a flash camera. Observed a large, long, straight flash of white light.  It lit up the field below like a giant flash camera.  No sound.  No smoke.  Very quick.  That same night, saw another, but it curved off and seemed like it was 100s yards long in the sky.  Laser beam tests?  Atmospheric phenomenon?;38.8956;-89.3967
