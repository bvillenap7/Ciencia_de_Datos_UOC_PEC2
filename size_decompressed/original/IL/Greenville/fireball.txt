Green Fireball in lightning pattern observed.;1999-05-01 22:00:00;1-2 sec;Green Fireball in lightning pattern observed. Observed green fire ball fall from the sky in a lightning type pattern.  Lasted for approx. 1-2 sec.  No sound.  No smoke.  Had a zig - zag pattern and curved turns as it fell.  Almost appeared as if it had a predetermined pattern, and the fire ball (bright green laser light) followed the pattern instantaneously.  Bright and luminous.;38.8956;-89.3967
Green fireball in typical meteor pattern observed.;1999-06-01 22:30:00;1-2 sec.;Green fireball in typical meteor pattern observed. Observed a green fire ball fly in an east to west direction across the sky.  Bright and luminous.  No sound.  No smoke.  When the fireball ended, it split up into fragments.  The fragments were as bright as the original ball, and then instantly disappeared.  Appears to be a form of energy release.  Does not appear to be an object.;38.8956;-89.3967
Green fireball of double ball pattern (colon configuration  : with one tail) observed.;1999-07-01 23:00:00;5 sec;Green fireball of double ball pattern (colon configuration  : with one tail) observed. Observed a double ball fireball descend from the sky in an arc pattern.  There was one tail for both balls.  They looked like a colon (:) falling from the sky.  This lasted fairly long - at least 5 seconds or more (moving somewhat slow) and was not like any meteor.  The fireballs appeared to have an orange/red color in them, but the tail was definitely green.  Then it disappeared.  No sound.  No smoke.  Did not appear to be an object, but some kind of energy release.;38.8956;-89.3967
