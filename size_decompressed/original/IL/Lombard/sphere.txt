Black sphere;1999-06-30 20:30:00;30seconds;Black sphere I spotted a dark plane 80% above the horizon moving North at regular speed & then noticed a Black ball slightly smaller than the plane (est. 30ft dia.)cross its path from behind moving slowly(heading NNE). The plane & pitch black ballappeared to be at simmilar altitude, however the plane had noticable wings & blinking lights - the ball had neither. For the previous 2 days I had seen a black helo each day. On day two I added a pair of binoculars to my workbag & saw another black helo w/ black blades, funny I couldnt see the markings with 8 power at 1/2 mile. The plane passed quickly yet the ball slowly crossed the sky( as i watched it I heard in my mind-you are not seeing this - it is not happening. I said to myself Like hell it isn't & ran in the house for the binoculars, 10 seconds later I was back outside but it had vanished from sight. Now I know why not so many reports are made, at a deeper level of mind I was being told to ignore what I was seeing, I shook that quickly( I think), but from now on I have a camera at all times.I am still baffeled at the thought of thought transference & I suggest we at very least, somehow try to prepare our minds better, but how? Funny,I dont remember that I heard a sound from the jet, now that I think about it.;41.8721;-88.0159999999998
Round craft flying low over Unincorporated Lombard;2007-07-12 23:20:00;3 mins;Round craft flying low over Unincorporated Lombard I was standing in the backyard with the dog when what appeared to be a sphere of flame rose out of the neighbors yard. I lost it behind the trees, then saw a sphere shaped object coming towards me from the same area. It was round and nearly silent, and was maybe 100 ft in the air, so even though it was fairly dark I was able to get a decent look at it. It had blinking lights on it, and would have looked like a high flying plane had I not seen it come from between the tree scape instead of over them, and paid enough attention to it so I could make out the round shape of it. There was just the one craft, but was spotted in the same 5 minute time span as an extremely high flying plane (I thought it was a satellite at first, this thing was flying way over commercial altitudes) and a what looked to be a low flying fighter jet (noticed him because he was perpendicular to the typical flight path of this area and the shape of the plane body);41.8721;-88.0159999999998
