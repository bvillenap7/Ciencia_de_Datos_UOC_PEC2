Two thin, pinkish glowing rings drifting through the air.;2013-10-12 22:30:00;2 minutes;Two thin pinkish glowing rings drifting through the air. Walking out of work after we closed, I looked up as I walked to my car.   was going to see if the moon or any stars were out but instead I saw two ring-like objects floating in the distance.   These objects were composed of a thin ring which glowed a pinkish-orange color and a large hole in the middle of the them.   Judging distance and size was difficult as they at times appeared to only be the size of a kite and seemed to only be a couple hundred feet above the street lights.  There was little to no wind that could keep them aloft for as long as I managed to view them.   As I viewed them, they drifted around at a 90 degree angle and continued to float onward.  The one further away from me seemed to tilt a bit more than the other.   By the time I had reached my car, they had almost completely vanished.
