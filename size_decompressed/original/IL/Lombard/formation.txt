As we started taking pictures of the craft it made a very high speed turn north northeast.    Then it appeared to be three separate crafts in formation as it made its high-speed turn we were able to photograph the flame/engine propellant streams.  It made another high speed turn South and upward and disappeared getting smaller smaller till it was about the size of a star. We studied the photos and it appears to be three separate crafts.

5-8 orange lights over suburban Chicago;2013-10-11 22:10:00;1 minute;5-8 orange lights over suburban Chicago As I exited the grocery store, I walked West towards my motorcycle.  As I went to get on I looked straight ahead and noticed orange lights in the sky off in the distance near the horizon.  The lights were probably about 5 miles or more but there were 5-8 orange lights.     The orange lights moved in a formation at a constant speed.  The lights remained equidistant from each other moving along the horizon in a perfect south-north direction.   The lights formation were in a 2 or three lights equally spaced above 3 or 4 lights.;41.8721;-88.0159999999998
