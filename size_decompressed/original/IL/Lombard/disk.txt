saucer shaped object in the sky glows white and fades three times in sky;2004-12-31 16:00:00;3 minutes;saucer shaped object in the sky glows white and fades three times in sky As my husband and I were driving to our local grocery store today, I saw something I can't explain. It was a pretty clear day. A few clouds in the sky, but pretty blue. As I was looking up I saw a disk-shaped (or oval) object high in the sky, glowing near one of the clouds. At first I thought it might be a plane (the O'Hare airport is near here) but as I watched the object it faded, disapearred for a few moments and then reappeared in the same place. It glowed again, a very white bright light(roundish), slowly faded and then disappeared again. After the first time I saw it I had been trying to point it out to my husband. It reappeared for a third time in the same place and my husband and I watched it for a few seconds as it glowed and faded twice and then disappeared. We have been going over this, trying to be logical, but we are very familiar with seeing planes in the sky. As far as we could tell the object did not seem to have any type of wing structure or tail structure. It was silver or metallic. There was no fume trail (all of the other planes we saw had one). There were other planes in the sky at various heights, but they were still distinguishable(we could see wing and tail signs). This was not. We can not come up with any logical explanation other than this was a ufo.;41.8721;-88.0159999999998
Sighting in Lombard, IL.;2016-02-01 18:25:00;10 seconds;Sighting in Lombard, IL. My boyfriend & I were driving down Sunset Ave.  I saw as an object omitting white light was coming down like a shooting star.  I quickly realized that's not what a star looks like.   It stopped for about 3 seconds and that's when I saw the object was round & a green light flashed from the side of it.   It then quickly went east disappearing into the sky.
