quick, very bright stoplight green, pulsing, progressively vanishing light;2008-10-09 21:00:00;5 seconds;quick, very bright stoplight green, pulsing, progressively vanishing light It was a very clear night at around nine o’clock.  I live in a condo building on the 5th floor out of a 7 floor building.  My wife and I were watching television and we were engaged in conversation so I was looking her way which was in front of a window.  That is when I noticed an object come over the building and trees rather quickly.   I was looking south and the object was traveling south east.   First, I noticed the color which was very bright and green, almost like a neon green.  In my opinion I thought the light looked like a green stop light color but much more intense.  Also, the light was slightly pulsing big to small repetitions at a steady, swift rate.  Second, I noticed it didn’t have any trails like a shooting star or meteorite plus I had never seen anything like this so close .  The angle was about 25-35 degrees. Lastly, the object traveling in a perfect straight line in that approximate angle, progressively got smaller and eventually vanished (all taking place in about 5-7 seconds).  This is the first unidentified flying object that I have ever seen.  I know that it was not man made, it was just to fast and the above description makes it impossible.  It was fast but not fast enough to be a comet or some type of space rock in my opinion.  I have not been able to not come up with a logical explanation for something like this.  I immediately told my wife to look out the window, and she saw the last couple of seconds and was speechless.  Given the above characteristics makes it hard for me to come up with what it could have been.   Thank you for your time.
