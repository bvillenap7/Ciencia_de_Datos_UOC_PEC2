I told my daughter,(she's 16), to look at the fast jet.  Approximately 10 seconds past and this object was very far away from the moon. We kept looking at how fast this was moving. I'd say after 30 seconds the object was across the atmosphere. Totally opposite from where the moon is. I saw 2 lights on the object. No flashing lights.  My daughter said she saw a red light. Friday night I took my daughter out to dinner. We were driving east on Deerfield Road going into Highland Park,IL.  As I recall it was about 6:30 pm(18:30.  At first I saw 2 very bright lights by the moon.  I could tell that they were airplanes.  I saw the flashing lights. Then about a minute later I saw a bright light come from behind the moon. This object was moving very fast and heading to the south at a very high speed.  I told my daughter to keep her eye on it.  I told herthat it's going to fast to be a jet. I saw 2 white lights and my daughter said she saw a red light. I did not see any flashing lights, like you see on a airplane or a jet.  From the location of the moon being in front of me. This object was heading in a southerly direction.  From where the moon was in about 30 seconds the craft was across the sky no where near the moon.;42.176;-87.8090000000001
