There was a very large cylinder with spokes and lights coming out of it floating silently between 50 and 100 yards up.  I had the impression that if the object was at ground level it would have been about a block long.  I pulled my car over and got out to stare at it for a couple minutes before It registered in my mind that this was sort of freaky.  I never reported this officially because I have always been skeptical of my own experience.  After all of this time I am not sure of the date.  I may even be off by a year.

The wife and kids were there an a few friends.  I can't drink spirits so I laid back on the blanket.  I was starring up watching ballons float away when I noticed way, way up in the sky.  This was no ballon.  Taking a guess if it was about the size of a bus, it was about 2 miles up no con trail.  It took about a half hour to go from South to North.  I have good eyes so I kept watching it until it moved from view.  Darnest thing!;42.176;-87.8090000000001
