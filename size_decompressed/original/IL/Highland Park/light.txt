Bright light seen in the North heading south then to vanish in a red color.;2010-09-15 20:00:00;15 Seconds;Bright light seen in the North heading south then to vanish in a red color. It was around the middle of September, 2010 about 7:45 PM and I was telling  a friend about the planets and stars in the sky.  Seconds later I noticed a bright white light in the north over the trees heading south. I watched the light waiting to see strobe lights flash.  No strobe lights were seen. The unidentified object was very bright.  Like when planet Venus is exceptionally  bright. Only this light was moving at a steady rate.  Then the light stopped dead in its tracks.  Hovered for a couple of seconds then started getting smaller.  It turned into a red dot and disappeared.  I believe the illusion of it getting ‘smaller’ was really the object going directly up into space, hence it getting smaller.  There were no sounds coming from the unknown light.

At first I thought it was a one group, but very soon I realized that only one is a plane.  It had distinct lights and strobe lights were blinking. The rest was flying at 300-400 KTS in a formation, all in red lights.  Not in a particular order, however they proceeded in one direction.  Objects did not have any strobe lights. I thought, maybe F-16 using after burners, but there wasn't jet engine noise at all.;42.176;-87.8090000000001
