I have never really mentioned this to anyone because I did not think much of it even though it was an event that changed the way I look at the universe.   I was driving home from a friends house in a neighboring city.  I was coming on a long stretch of road going back home around 1:00am and I saw this very bright fireball or light about 1 mile ahead of me over the nature center near my house.   At first I thought it was just a plane or helicopter but when it did not move or make a sound for about 20 seconds, I sped up so that I could get closer.  I got out of my car at the corner of a T intersection near my house and was looking up at this object that was very very bright.   After about 2 minutes, it completely fell out of the sky into the woods of the nature center.  I drove to the park entrance instead of going home but did not find anything.  It was very weird and no one believed me when I said something. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
