4 square lighted windows in the sky-stationary- above the tree line.;2011-05-17 22:30:00;5-10 mins;4 square lighted windows in the sky-stationary- above the tree line. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  We have requested more information about the sighting.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM SOURCE OF REPORT)) Hello Mr. Davenport, I live very close to Lake Michigan, about a block away from the shoreline.  It happened at night (around 10:30 pm) so I could not tell if it was a rectangle or an oval.  The shape of the windows lead me to believe that it probably had the shape of a rectangle.  I honestly don't know how long, large or what the shape of the object was outside.  From the time I saw it until the time I pulled into my garage took about about 5 minutes, max.   It was not moving.   As I approached my house I lost sight of it because my home is at the bottom of a small hill and the trees blocked my vision. I am sorry to say that I did not leave my garage to further investigate.  What caught my attention was that it was not moving and that it had, what appeared to be, four, rectangular windows that were lit up.  The light seemed to be incandescent and not fluorescent.  I hope that this is helpful. BTW: Is your center privately funded or is it funded by the US government or a university??
