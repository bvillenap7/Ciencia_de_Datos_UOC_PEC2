The power in house flickered on and off several times followed by a surge complete darkness then the lights went back on.  The rest of the neighbors didn't get power back and the whole block was in complete darkness.  Due to the power failure several neigh ors came to my house to power up there phones/tablets.total 7 of us.  My son recieved a text from NASA that ISSC was pacing I mb orbit an maybe be seen around 8:30 p.m. we ran outside to check it out and were able to see it after mistaking a few planes first. After it was over we hung outside for awhile as it was a clear sky we were star gazing when we saw two light either two separate crafts or one big one as they followed perfectly in line to each other. They moved quickly across sky (not as fast as metro or comet but not as slow as a plane or jet). The front light grew extremely bright for a short time then back to it's original brightness and carried on across the sky for another 30 to 40 seconds then completely disappeared both lights. Because it was in the sky I have nothing to measure it to so not sure how far up or how big the object was accurately so I will not guess. This isn't the first odd light in the sky out here for the past three night we have seen what I have been telling my child they are just satellites reflecting the sun from space.  I know it's something more but what I don't know.   I am in no way stating Aliens just stating I couldn't identify what it was and its not being the norm as we often sky gaze.  I tried to video tape but didn't get what I was hoping for.;41.3071;-88.1518
