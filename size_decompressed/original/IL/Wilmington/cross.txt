Isolated storm o my left I was takening a picture that it was just a small section all other clouds white fluffy sky blue. I looked again and saw a very bright white kinda looked like Saturn shape but light was shining off of it. It was going fast one direction with ball in front it slowed down ball down and went opposite direction ball back pointing direction it was going.
