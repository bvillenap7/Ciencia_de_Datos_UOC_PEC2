Falling star that evolved and grew in size and color, to end in a brilliant green ball of trailing light. ((NUFORC Note:  Meteor?  PD));2016-04-15 22:15:00;2-3 seconds;Falling star that evolved and grew in size and color, to end in a brilliant green ball of trailing light that disappeared from sight Meteor?  April 16, 2016.  10:15 PM North on IL 57 mile marker 5-6 from Cairo, IL.  I had just left a rest stop from doing my ‘TM’ (Transcendental Meditation), so I was fresh and alert. I was driving northbound on Illinois route 57N, windshields are clear/no tint  There was no oncoming traffic at the time, and only a few northbound vehicles. I noticed from the center of the windshield coming down from the top of the windshield, a bright white streak of light which went horizontal with the horizon in front of me, from center of the windshield, moved fully across to the left lower side of the driver’s side window to the treeline. It went from a small white steak to a long multi-colored ‘tailed’ streak and ending with bright green ball of light that disappeared, either from the treeline or from just burning out. It lasted 2 to 3 seconds, as it crossed the sky from what I saw… fantastic!  I had not ever seen such a fall. Thoughts that crossed my mind in 2-3 seconds:  Falling star, missile (are we being attacked?)  Rocket Bomb Fire Color to Green – bright!!  Large – half the size of an over-head full moon ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Oops. Yes, Cairo, Illinois, and it was 15th of April, 2016, which was Friday night 10:15 pm. Sorry and thanks.
