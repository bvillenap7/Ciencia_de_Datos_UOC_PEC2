Well, it happened at around 10 P.M., when I was in my bedroom on the computer. I'm sitting here talking to my friends, yaddy yaddy ya, you know havin a good time.  All of a sudden, I feel a sudden vibrant movement of the house, I don't hesitate to think what the hell is going on, I quickly dart for the window, and right when I look out, to my own suprise, I see this triangular-shaped object just traveling in a straight line in what looked like 150 mph. This triangular object also had lights on the bottom of it. and red lights in the back of it. It wasn't flat, it was 3-demensional. It made a huge roaring noise. Right when I lossed sight of it, I could still see it, hovering, just sitting in mid air, all I could see at this time were the lights though. And all of a sudden, it vanished, and that was the last I have seen it. This is definetly no plane, helicopter, military base test flight, or anything else normal. It is the wierdest thing I have ever seen in my life and I'm still shocked over it. I think this is something that definetly needs to be reasearched or investigated.;39.5464;-89.2949000000001
