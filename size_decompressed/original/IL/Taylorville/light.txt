My UFO incident, 1976, July 4th,   Midnight:  While in the country and driving into town, 4 of us in 2 separate vehicles saw an almost Moon sized light moving fairly close (100-200 yd's. away)---in front of us and in a horizontal manner at 1 mph.  My friend, the driver, had to hit me on the shoulder several times so I would look at “It”....apparently, I was in a trance, and at first,  I could  not look at the huge perfectly circular amber light just ahead of us.   Finally, I observed it long enough to see exactly what it was---it was, a UFO!  Then, in an instant, the big light went out and 2 comparatively smaller cobalt blue zig-zag flames, like lightning bolts appeared---while my eyes followed their very quick vertical assent---they then, instantly disappeared at the blink of an eye, virtually, at the speed of light, and, it was all gone. I never saw a Craft, just those 2 amazing lights! ((NUFORC Note:  If the sighting occurred after the fireworks, it would have been 24:00 hrs., not 00:00 hrs.  PD));39.5464;-89.2949000000001

Myself,my daughter, my neighbor,her stepson and my grandson. Our ages range from 8 to 49. Our husbands were in the truck just ahead of us. I first noticed what I thought was a large bright star in the lower sky right in front of us. It didn't move. the sun had just gone down behind the tree line, but it wasn't dark yet. I thought it was a star, but I started seeing more. Up to 7 at one time. I then mentioned it to the others, and we called our husbands on the cell phone. They had been watching to. They were very bright silver and moved after a few minutes and then appeared to have a tail. We stopped and took a picture, not developed yet. There was alot of traffic on this same road so I know others seen them. I found no news reports so we were very courious to hear any information on this. After they were gone we seen a dark colored helocopter flying in the area. Its hard to judge the distance but we guessed them to be over the Springfield,IL area. These were not airplanes because they sat in one place to long and then changed formation and stayed there.;39.5464;-89.2949000000001
