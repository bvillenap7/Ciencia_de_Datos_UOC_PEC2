UFO SIGHTED UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL IN TAYLORVILLE, IL.;1983-07-15 22:00:00;1-2 minutes;UFO SIGHTED UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL IN TAYLORVILLE, IL. While laying in bed watching the Honeymooners I began to hear a low-pitched humming noise that gradually grew louder. It was late, probably around 2200 hours. I sat up and opened the blinds to take a look.  Hovering outside at a height of around 10 meters was a saucer shaped craft of metallic construction. The total distance waway from my window was only about 50 feet. Encircling the outer edges of the craft were a series of lights, red, green, and blue. The lights created a soft glow about the craft, which was approximately 30 feet or so in diameter and rotated slowly as it hovered in place. The craft's hull seemed to have a bluish hue with a silver base color. The height of the craft was approximately 8-10 feet at the center, possibly a touch more. We lived on an old one-block dead end with only a few other homes on the street. Behind the craft was simply our next door neighbor's one story house, with a large pine tree off to the right and our garage off to the left. No other major lights were present (a couple street lights were on) and the sky was clear. The humming noise given off by the craft continued to pulsate throughout the encounter. I watched for 1-2 minutes and then ran to my mothers room to get a camera, almost falling over the kitchen table. She told me it must be a helicopter or something and I persisted to tell her that it was no helicopter. I couldn't find a camera so I sprinted back to get another look, but the craft had already begun to fly away. The last I could see of it was as it flew at a good distance behind the large pine tree in our yard (it faded behind it). ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));39.5464;-89.2949000000001
