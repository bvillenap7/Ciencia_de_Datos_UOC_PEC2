3 Red lights in triangle formation moving slowly and silently;2005-10-01 03:00:00;10-20 minutes;3 Red lights in triangle formation moving slowly and silently Me and my friends observed 3 red lights in the sky, about the height of an airplane when it is in mid-flight.   The lights were in a tringle formation, it wasn't a perfect triangle, it was irregular.   The lights moved very slowly across the sky and made no sound.   After some time the lights started to flash in and out, and then faded away one by one.  We also noticed an unusual anount of meteors in that area of the sky. (NUFORC Note:  All reports of the two sightings (23:15 hrs., 30SE05, and 01:10 hrs., 01OC05) from Illinois will be passed along to Dr. Mark Rodighier, Director of the CENTER FOR UFO STUDIES, Chicago, as well as to Mr. Dave Marler, State Director of the MUTUAL UFO NETWORK for the State of Illinois, who will pass them along to his Field Investigators in the Chicago area.
