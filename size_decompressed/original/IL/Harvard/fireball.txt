Fiery white orb in the sky.;2012-08-24 00:40:00;5 minutes;Fiery white orb in the sky. I was leaving work at 00:40.  I had just punched out, and I remember the time to be exact.  From where I work to where my car is parked is a three minute walk.  As I was walking I noticed something above me in the sky, traveling at what seemed to be about 30 miles an hour.  My first thought was a shooting star, but this seemed to be about 50ft above me.  It was maybe 15-20ft across.  I was intrigued trying to figure out what it was.  It was like a glowing white ball of fire.  The best I can describe it would be similar to a Christmas tree light when all other lights in the room are off.  It seemed to travel in a straight path with a little erratic movement at times.  I watched it for a few minutes, and it disappeared about a quarter mile away.  Gone. That fast.  I got in my car and tried to figure where it might have gone, but there was nothing.  It very well may have been a meteorite.  I just remember being intrigued, and scared as hell at the same time.   I keep telling myself it was nothing.  I hope I'm right.;42.4235000000003;-88.6029000000007
