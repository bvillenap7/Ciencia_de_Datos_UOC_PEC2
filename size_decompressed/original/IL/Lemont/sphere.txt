4 orange glowing spheres with a plamsa emissions around each craft.;2007-07-11 22:30:00;3 min;4 orange glowing spheres with a plamsa emissions around each craft. I was sitting outside in the garage and 4 orange spheres appeared around 9:00 pm above my neighbor house at a 45* angle . They appeared to be glowing almost like a hazy plasma flame around each craft, all the craft were flying north in close staggered formation less than 500 feet from the ground and the size of each craft is hard to determine but I would say about the size of a small aircraft , I was scared , I ran inside and told my  mother who was a skeptic and grab my camera, I ran outside with my mother and took a few pics but I was nervous and shaking to get a good shot and they were going away by the time I can get a good shot and they blink out one at a time, I snapped a 4 pics in normal mode and in night framing mode , I could not believe what I just witnessed and then  all 4 appeared again at 9:36 pm in the same formation and going in the same direction as before , this time I was ready with the camera, I took close up shots, and they show the plasma flame around each craft. I have 9 photos in total showing different formation flying, I am an aerospace engineering student who studies engines and different forms of propulsion and I know these were not conventional aircraft by any means.;41.7083;-87.9764
Very bright light in heavily travelled airspace.  ((NUFORC Note:  Could not have been ISS at 23:00 hrs..  PD));2011-06-28 23:00:00;30 minutes;Very bright light in heavily travelled airspace I am a private pilot, flying out of KMDW, and know how to recoginize aircraft.   While sitting on my porch with my wife last night a very bright and large object was spotted in the NW hemisphere travelling SE at an approx altitude of 10,000 ft.   The object appeared to be large in size and brilliant white.  No flashing lights nor red or green indicators.   The light was visible from all angles.   Object moved in a straight path and did not make noise.   Approx speed 300kts.   Ten minutes later a similar object was observed at a very high altitude, therefore smaller in size, travelling south to north.   Ten minutes later, at same altitude west to east - these last two observations could have been satellites.   First object spotted slowly dimmed then disappeared, no clouds observed.
