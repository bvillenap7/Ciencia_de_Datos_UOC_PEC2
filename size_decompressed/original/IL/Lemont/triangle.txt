Describes it as an equilateral triangle with white lights on the vertices of the triangle.  Also notes lines on the underside of craft that appeared to be changes in the depth of the material that the craft was made of.  Craft made no sound and was hovering low in the sky.  It appeared to float as it flew eventually in a southwesterly direction.  One red light was observed by myself in the center of the underside.  It flew with one of the straight edges as it's lead, rather than one of the points.  The lights on the straight sides of craft were white and blue.  You could not differentiate wings or a tail section, it was a solid triangle. My daughter, 16yrs old.  Junior in High School, National Honor Society member.  Currently, second in the class. Myself- 41yrs old, nurse, mother. Neither one of us has ever seen anything like this before!;41.7083;-87.9764
