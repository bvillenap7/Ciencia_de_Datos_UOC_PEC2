Me and my buddies came over in the hotub out side on the porch, we were sitiing there and 2 huge fireballs were floating in are back yard and then there left going at about 100mph. They were about 20ft tall and 30ft wide. They seem to be talking to each other by weird sounds and they would turn to each other and then look back at us. when they laft the left burn marks on the ground just alittle bit though. It taosted the grass.;41.7083;-87.9764
