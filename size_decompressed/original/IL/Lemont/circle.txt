Approx. 50 craft flying in various formations observed across the evening sky.;2007-07-07 21:30:00;25 Min.;Approx. 50 craft flying in various formations observed across the evening sky. While swimming outside my Equestrian Estates' home on 7/7/07 at approx. 9:30 pm, 6 people observed approx. 50 craft flying in various formations from southwest to northeast.   The craft flew in a variety of formations 3-4 flew in a straight line, others in square or triangular patterns.  The crafts were round shaped with an orange haze of light.  There was no sound produced by the crafts.   At one point, 2 objects appeared to move together and separate apart very quickly.  After each craft reached a certain point, they moved in different directions and disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

Orange lights over Chicago area 7/7/07;2007-07-07 21:37:00;10 minutes;Orange lights over Chicago area 7/7/07 Over a span of 10 minutes we saw over 75 orange circular objects in the sky.  They flew across the sky quickly and seemed to disappear in the sky.  Not fireworks, not comets, but when they were directly overhead they seemed to have a circular light underneath them as well.

Brightly lit craft hovers above tree line, moves off into distance;2011-06-14 22:45:00;3 minutes;Brightly lit craft hovers above tree line, moves off into distance I was walking my dog at 10:45 PM outside our Townhome.  Our development is proteted by trees to the East.  All of a sudden, I saw a large circular aircraft appear above the treeline.  It was probably about 150 feet away from me, and only about 200 feet in the air (it was not significantly higher than the treeline).  By my best guess, the craft was maybe 100 feet in diameter.  This was not just a case of a small orb in the sky - it was right there in front of me. There were a large quantity of bright blue lights on the underside, and on the vertical surface were many bright white lights.  There were also blue lights that lined the top perimeter of the craft.  There were also red lights that seemed to be randomly placed around the craft as well.  All three of the different colored lights were blinking at random intervals (individual lights were all blinking randomly). The craft hovered above the tree line for about 1 minute, and I could hear a very faint pulsating noise.  There was no wind effect that could be noticed on the trees, etc.  It then started to move North very slowly, at the same elevation, and eventually passed aross the Illinois & Michigan Canal.  I watched it move North until I could no longer see it (it eventually got far enough to where it fell below the horizon line).  The craft looked identical from my view looking to the East, as it did in my view looking to the North;41.7083;-87.9764
There is objects in the sky that at first looked like stars but then when I looked closer it was lights that were blinking . Been watch;2020-11-14 02:00:00;Alll night for a week;There is objects in the sky that at first looked like stars but then when I looked closer it was lights that were blinking . Been watching it for about a week sometimes couldn’t take picture or video because it would be kind of far away but today I did. The objects move sometimes forward sometimes in circular motion and today when I started filming it seems like it started coming down every time I looked at it through the window. At first I taught maybe it’s drawn or something but it seemed weird that the sky is full of them. And when I took a video and photo it looks like it has some kind of aura it changes shapes, kind of hard to describe.;41.7083;-87.9764
