The fifst thing I noticed was a bright light aimed in the direction I was coming from. Instead of pulling in to my house I kept going towards it. I was traveling west on New Ave. towards the refinery which it was hovering above. It moved slightly to the left and right like it was trying to get a good look at something in the refinery. As I got closer(within a couple of blocks)it started to move south. When it got about a mile away it started to move directly east,accelerating as it went. I turned around in the road and started back east on New Ave. Then it really started to pick up speed as I saw it through the trees. For a second or two it looked like it was landing like a small plane. We finally caught up with it when it gained altitude and started to head north. As it came directly over us I pulled over and shut the van off. I tried to see if it would make an idetifiable sound. Absolutely nothing was heard. As it was passing over us I noticed some different colored lights blinking in a random fashion.It appeared to be about 100 ft. in the air,not very high for a plane.We have a Coast Guard helicopter that flies up and down the I&M canal on a daily basis,and we can always hear it coming, so that was not it. It continued north out of sight and that was it.;41.7083;-87.9764
