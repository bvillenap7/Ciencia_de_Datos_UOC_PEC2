2 space ships in the sky;2006-08-03 10:00:00;45 min.;2 space ships in the sky Last night I was out walking my dog, and I happened to look up at the sky because I read something about Jupiter being able to be seen. As I was admiring it and the moon a blinking light caught my eye and as I was staring at it I was wondering if maybe it was a plane. After I put my dog in the house I ran back outside to look again and thats when I notice there was 3 of them. At first they were all flying in a triangle then one of them disapeared. So here I am watching the remaing 2 ships, as far as I could tell they had red and white blinking lights which went around in a cirle. The lights were blinking quite fast as they went across the sky. I looked like they were deliberately flying at the same speed with one of them flying slightly behind the other but higher up, the other was flying ahead of the other but lower. But the were definitly flying together. I don't know if they were trying to find a place to land or not because they soon disappeared behind some trees. I was outside watching them for about 45 mins. I thought the light were blinking way to fast ato be airplane and I have never seen 2 planes flying together like they were.;37.819;-88.4494
