Blus light, isolated road, possible missing time;1976-06-01 00:00:00;15 minutes;Blus light, isolated road, possible missing time I was six years old at the time, and even now, if I concentrate, I can recall what happened.  My mother, her best friend, and myself were driving on a section of road called Grange Road.  Today, there are a lot of houses, but at the time, it was all farmland with maybe one or two houses.  It was just after midnight, and I remember waking up.  I was alseep in the back seat, and I woke up feeling very frightened.  I sat up, and my mother and her friend were obviously worried.  The car we were in was cutting in-and-out, and finally died.  As soon as the car stopped, we all saw a blue light directly ahead, maybe about 20 feet off of the ground, and about a football field legnth away.  It glided towards us, made no noise, and as it got to within 15 feet, it stopped in midair, hoovering.  My mom grabbed me from the backseat and held on, and her friend was crying.  I was crying, too, because whatever it was, it was making us all upset.  After about five minutes, I don't recall what happened, because for whatever reason, I fell alseep.  Weird, I know, but I swear it happened.  I woke up sometime later, and we three were sitting there, shocked, and the light was gone.  My mom and her friend - to this day - swear they had missing time, about 10 minutes worth.  I hope this helps... ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.
