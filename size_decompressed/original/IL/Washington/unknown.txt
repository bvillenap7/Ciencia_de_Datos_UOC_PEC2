Flashing lights that almost hit an airplane;2004-08-30 20:45:00;25 min;Flashing lights that almost hit an airplane I, along with three coworkers, was sitting outside in the back our workplace when we witnessed some flashing lights.  These lights flashed faster than any strobe light or airplane light we had ever seen.  Suddenly, we saw an airplane coming across the sky.  This light almost took that airplane down.  It went directly under the plane and for a fleeting moment, we all yelled, It's going to hit the plane!  Just as suddenly, the light shifted sharply to the left.  At the same time, we noticed another set of the same type of lights opposite the first set.;40.708740625;-89.4206312499999
