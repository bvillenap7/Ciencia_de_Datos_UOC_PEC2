Possible UFO, around commercial Jet plane;2008-06-05 18:00:00;A Few Seconds;Possible UFO, around commercial Jet plane I was outside watching my son play in his new wading pool, I was taking pictures of him playing and just basically relaxing and overseeing his activities. Since I live near O'Hare airport, I naturally always snap photos of the planes taking off from the airport.  I snapped three photos of three different planes about 8-10 minutes apart. When I went to upload them into my computer, I noticed that the first picture had these strange cigar shaped objects around the plane. I immediatley checked the other pics, They were clear and there were no objects on any of the photos.  I checked my camera and even checked to see if there was debris on the lens, there was none. All my other pictures of planes were all clear and did nit have anything on them.  That is why I decided to submit the report and the picture to you.;41.9161;-87.9062
