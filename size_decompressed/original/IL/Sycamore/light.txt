Bright star like object moved erratically, turned bluish at times, and pulsed brighter at times.;2009-01-24 20:00:00;over an hour;Bright star like object moved erratically, turned bluish at times, and pulsed brighter at times. My husband witnessed what looked to be a very bright star moving erratically from left to right, then downward, upward, slowly then quickly.  He witnessed this from the town of Aurora Illinois all the way to our home in Sycamore Illinois. At times the bright star like object pulsed brighter and at times it also looked bluish. When he came home my daughter and I joined him outside to witness this object.  I noticed what looked to be reddish lights off to the far left and right of the object at times.  It mostly hovered, but at times moved erratically.  After about an hour of this it was gone. We did not see it take off, we went inside as it was cold, but when we returned later it had left the area.
