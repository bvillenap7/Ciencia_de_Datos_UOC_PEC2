Dull orange near ball like lights moving from ENE to WSW.  They came in pairs and the southern most object was leading in all three pairs.  They glowed orange as they were seen coming from the east and continued to glow orange until they passed overhead, but as they past they started to dim and then slowly disaperred as they headed west as though there was no light in or on the back of them.  The pairs were about three minutes apart and appeared to travel exactely the same route.   Then a few minutes later, I saw one that seemed to be traveling down to the horizon in the ENE sky.  There were no flashing lights on these objects.   We could not determine how high they were but my guess would be over 1000' and less than 10,000'.;41.9977;-88.6923999999999
