About a mile from home I noticed a bright object in the sky over the cornfields off to my right. It seemed strange to me immediately, and I pulled to the side of the road to look at it.  The object seemed to be made entirely of light.  It was so bright and twinkly, I couldn't clearly see the perimeter, but it was oblong/oval/tic tic-tac shaped, and at least 20 or more times larger than the a bright star or planet.  It appeared to be in our atmosphere, as it sat, unmoving in the sky.  Saturn was bright that night, and this object appeared in the sky near Saturn, so it was easy to have a frame of reference.  I watched for between one and two minutes.  The object never moved.  Not closer or further, not left or right. After watching for those couple minutes and being totally mystified, I got spooked and drove the remaining mile home.  When I got home.  I came out to look at Saturn.  No oval light in sight.;41.9977;-88.6923999999999
