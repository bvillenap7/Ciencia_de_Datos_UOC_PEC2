3 long bright orange objects seen by 2 people in Gurnee IL;2019-07-27 21:26:00;2 minutes;3 long bright orange objects seen by 2 people in Gurnee IL My husband and I were sitting outside, enjoying a summer evening.  Something caught his eye, he looked up, and screamed for me to look.  We both looked and saw 3 extremely bright orange objects in the sky.  They were long and not too large.  He yelled for me to take a picture.  I always have my cell phone with me so I took 3 pictures.  Then he said, no, take a video.  I switched to video mode but at that point the objects started moving quickly.  We starting running from the back of our house to the front, but the objects moved quickly together and then out of sight.;42.3653;-87.9472
