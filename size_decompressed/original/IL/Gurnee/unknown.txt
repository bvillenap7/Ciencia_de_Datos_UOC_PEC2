Five UFO's over Gurnee, Waukegan IL area;1981-08-15 01:00:00;20 min;Five UFO's over Gurnee, Waukegan IL area I saw what I thought was a satellite moving across the eastern sky moving north very slow and high enough in the sky to be a satellite.  The white light broke into five separate lights and flew in no specific pattern, like bugs around a light bulb. Then the five lights made a perfect triangle and continued across the sky in this formation for three to five minutes. At this time I went inside to get my mother to see what was happening. After She came outside and I pointed out where they were in the sky, the lights started to fly around again in no specific pattern. The five lights then flew into a single light, turned red and flew directly east, making a 90 degree turn straight out over Lake Michigan with such a speed as to leave a streak in the sky.

Strange sound that hovered in sky early in morning;2012-09-12 15:00:00;10 minutes;Strange sound that hovered in sky early in morning I was sleeping with my windows open.  I heard a very loud truck or something similar. I was waiting for the sound to go away but it was hovering. I woke up more now that this noise was not going away. I then thought it could be an airplane but it just didn't sound like anything I've ever heard. I got up to look outside but couldn't see anything as my backyard is all tall trees.  The noise went away and I went back to bed. About 2 mins later the noise returned. It hovered for another minute and left. Nothing has happened since.;42.3653;-87.9472
