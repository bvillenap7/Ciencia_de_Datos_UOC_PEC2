Orange/red glowing light in a circular shape;2013-03-13 19:00:00;7 minutes;Orange/red glowing light in a circular shape I was driving down the road (rt 173) with my boyfriend and brother.  When my brother pointed to nine diff orange/red glowing lights in the sky.  One by one they disappeared into oblivion.  I was personally terrified, just had a bad feeling about them being there.  Felt like I was being watched. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness fails to indicate a date.  We have assigned an arbitrary date.  PD));42.3653;-87.9472
