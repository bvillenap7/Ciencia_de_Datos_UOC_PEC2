Very low to ground, My friend and I were heading north on I-55 around 10 am, when I seen in the sky about the height of 2-3 telephone poles an object, looked to be brushed metalic.  I was driving and showed my friend, it was hoovering directly above the interstate and seemed to wooble back and forth.  There were no wires near it and it was very low.  As we passed it my friend kept watching it and as soon as we passed it, it disappered right before her eyes.  We did not experince any strang effects on us or the car.;42.3653;-87.9472
