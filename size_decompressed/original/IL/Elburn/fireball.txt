We were driving west in Elburn in a car with four passengers.  The driver noticed an orange light in the sky.   We all looked up to see four bright orange jellyfish shaped lights in the sky in a straight, diagonal line moving faster than any airplane we have ever seen.   They stayed in our vision for about ten minutes.   Something notable about this encounter was that one minute into the sighting, a military plane swooped under the four bright lights.;41.8829;-88.4587
