Possible ufo crash.;2015-09-17 20:30:00;6+ hours;Possible ufo crash. Nobody actually saw anything flying.  They closed off River Road at Belmont and at Irving Park but you could see a long silver object stretching across all four lanes and into the woods in the river.   There had been a fatal car accident earlier at the same location so everybody figured it was just that.  That was until we seen military vehicles, FBI agents turning everyone away that would try to go look and Homeland security.  We also saw several military choppers circling the area for hours.  I posted this on a Facebook group that I am in Chicagoland petrol heads and car spotters.  We had several members take action and go try to get any evidence at the scene.  One member got there when it was clearing up and says he saw a wide load semi driving away with something underneath a tarp.  The semi was escorted by 4 unmarked trucks answer the 294 ramp at Irving Park towards Great Lakes Naval base.  Several members trying to go to the scene including myself for any signs of damage or debris but it was raining so hard that we couldn't really see anything.  Hours later I can still see a military chopper circling around from my house about 1 mile east.  We called Fox news and ABC and they would not comment or report on the incident.  There have been no announcments about what happend that night. Even local police say they dont know they where just called to set up the perimeter .;41.9544;-87.8725
