Formation of three orange/red orbs, followed by another orb several minutes later pass overhead.;2013-04-22 22:10:00;10 minutes;Formation of three orange/red orbs, followed by another orb several minutes later pass overhead. Was out walking our dogs when I saw 3 orange/red orbs in sky flying in triangle formation, keeping perfect pace with each other.  They were bright, made no noise and kept a constant rate of speed, formation and altitude.  They did not flash or blink like an airplane.  My neighbor puledl into his driveway so asked if he'd seen them. He told me he didn't see anything but as we spoke, another orb appeared, following the exact course as the others.  It was identical in every way to the group of three that passed overhead 5 minutes before. Chinese lanterns?  Maybe so, but Monday night at 10 pm is an unusual time for something like that.  I watched them fly for a distance of several miles before the ambient light drowned them out. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
