Fireworks were going off in the distance and I viewed 7 circular objects flying uniform distance apart.  One looked slightly reddish in color, the others white orbs.  I thought perhaps helicopters because they were flying at that speed.  Four of them moved northeast towards Lake MI.   I got my friend outside to view the other 3 above us.   They abruptly moved up quickly and disappeared.  I'm a federal scientist so was very interested in the display and what the objects were.  Others in the area viewed them too and captured them on video.  Some mentioned Chinese Lanterns.  Who knows?!;42.0991567567567;-87.9795905405404
