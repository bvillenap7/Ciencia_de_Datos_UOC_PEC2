A saucer the size of a small car hovered over the hood of my car and then backed up and stayed in front of my car for about 3 minutes, then elevated backwards and disappeared!  There was a slight glow around the edges. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));42.0991567567567;-87.9795905405404

A disk or saucer appeared above the hood of my car.  It had a glow to it.  My brain could not compute what my eyes were seeing.   It hovered for at least a minute, then lifted and disappeared.

I was 7 at the time.  We left the KFC that was on Northwest Hwy going NW in our car.  As we got closer to the intersection of Northwest Hwy and Euclid, I spotted an object that hung in the sky and was getting brighter.  It was dropping out of the sky in the north.  I pointed it out to my sister who was in the car.  She then asked my dad to look at it.  I then replied that it was a UFO.  My father, refused and brushed it off as an airplane.  To quite us he turned at the intersection prior to Euclid as to keep us from jumping around in the back seat since the streets he was taking had trees that over hung the road and obscured our view.  As was were going down Sigwalt St. the craft was now closer to the ground, 100 ft or so.  as we drove west on Sigwalt St. to the 7-11 store to get soda pop for dinner.  We pulled in and my father still refused to look up and cater the whims of his children.  He went in and as we stayed in the car, one of the other children and her frien who lived up the street from us saw the UFO, hovering with no sound, only the wind had picked up.  The wind was strange, blowing almost upward in direction and in a circular motion.  The face that she made was horrific, as in disblief that this could not be happening.  Her knees caved in and her friend dropped to the ground.  What I thought at the time was a neat thing now was burned in to my memory forever as a horror.  My sister and I were now wanting to go home, not in a panic, just a rush to get home.  The disk moving slowly was now above the intersection of Sigwalt St. and Wilke St.  My father exited the Store, as did the attendent.  My father finally looked up to see the disc and was amazed and puzzled as to what he was seeing, as we all were.  It moved over Rolling Meadows and slowly climbed upward, as fast as it came down.  It was about the size of one and a half houses (for the area I live in) it was black on the underside, blacker then the nig! ht and not reflective of any light, other then the lights that it had moving on its edges.  All diferent colors, but mostly yellow, red, orange.  As it climbed it the night sky, it was tilted in a way we saw the top.  It looked like a classic Bell shaped saucer, and the top was reflecting the lights on the edges so we were able to see the surface reflecting and giving away the top sides shape.  It never moved quickly and as far as I know no one else saw it.  At the time in Arlington and Rolling Meadows when evening came most people were inside, I am not sure if this was covered at the time in the papers.  My father pasted away in 1991, and my sister being sick, I thought I had to at least post this somewhere and see if anyone else knows of this. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
