While taking my dogs out in the backyard this evening I noticed an extra star in the handle of the big dipper.  At first, I thought was seeing things.   I readjusted my glasses and took another look.  This time, I confirmed an extra star in the handle.  Upon inspection, I was startled to see it suddenly move in a northerly direction.  After watching this star move for approximately 10-15 seconds it disappeared.  I have lived in the Chicagoland area all my life and am very familiar with the air traffic patterns.  I believe this was not an airplane nor satellite.  My refence to the star is exactly what it looked like.  I have no other description to offer.  Thank you.;42.0991567567567;-87.9795905405404
Airplane-sized light seen in night sky going abnormally fast before extinguishing.;2017-04-01 01:10:00;<2 seconds;Airplane-sized light seen in night sky going abnormally fast before extinguishing. Driving eastbound at night on Golf Road, east of Interstate 90, I saw a light, comparable in size to that of an airplane, becomes visible in my windshield as it speeds forward â€“ so, also going eastbound.  It was going about a few times faster than an airplane it wasn't as though it was gone in a flash.   Very shortly after I could see it, it disappeared.  There was no flourish when it disappeared, and while I've considered that it was just a reflection on the glass, it didn't have the sort of glow around it that light reflecting on glass usually has.   I also considered that it was a sort of shooting star, but again, there was no tail or glow around it.   I reiterate that the light looked exactly how a commercial airliner would have looked like in the night sky through a windshield its behavior was what was odd.   The entire sight lasted less than two seconds.;42.0991567567567;-87.9795905405404
