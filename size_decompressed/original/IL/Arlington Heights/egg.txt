On the day of Agust 3rd at 1pm I was taking my lunch laying down on the back stairs of my job, its a warehouse, I was looking up at the sky since where I laid it's shaded I was enjoying the warmth of the hot cement on my back.  Suddenly up in the sky I see a silver egg shape craft unlike I only seen in Si-fi but there it was it moved threw the sky up down in seconds, a second craft appeared it followed the other.In the blink of the eye they were gone.  I mean fast to fast to be from earth.  I couldnt believe what i just saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
