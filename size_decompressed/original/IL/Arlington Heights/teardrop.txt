teardrop shaped object over arlington heights;2007-10-06 18:30:00;1 minute;teardrop shaped object over arlington heights while out for an evening walk with my kids I happened to look up to the west and saw a small teardrop shaped object apparently hovering while spinning. The object was about 50 degrees in elevation from the horizon and appeared small. I an unable to place a size on the object as there were no reference objects I could compare it. We moved to a different location after observing the object for a minute or two and it was gone when we looked again. The object did not make any sound or have any lights.
