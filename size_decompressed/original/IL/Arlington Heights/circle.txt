Orange glow shapes fly by right before and during a fireworks show from one end of the horizon to the next.;2010-07-04 21:30:00;10 minutes;Orange glow shapes fly by right before and during a fireworks show from one end of the horizon to the next. Three objects at different times flew level from south to north. There was an orange glow at the front of the objects. They flew at a quick and constant speed while remaining level to the ground. It was hard to determine a shape. Two were on the same path with the third being lower in the sky.

UFO sighting over my health with pictures.;2010-07-20 21:00:00;2 hours(?);UFO sighting over my health with pictures. This is not a hoax and the photos have not been photoshopped. On July 10, 2010 I let me dog into the backyard to go potty.  I normally don’t look up but this night I did.  Lo and behold, I saw a V-formation of UFO marching in a northwest formation.  There was about 15 to 20 of them.  When one of them got directly overhead, I took the attached pictures.  It looks like you can see energy radiating.  I don’t think this was the space shuttle (especially since there was 15 to 20 of them). Additionally, one day a couple of years ago in the fall of 2006(?) I was on the train coming home from work in downtown Chicago (I live near O’Hare Airport).  I looked out my window and there are 7 or 8 UFOs heading to O’Hare Airport.  Planes do not travel in groups of 7 or 8 so these were definitely not airplanes.  This was around 5:00 to 5:30 p.m., or so.  I know other people who saw them also, who lived south of Chicago.  A couple of weeks later I heard there was a UFO over O’Hare Airport. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

End tip of handle of Ursa Major, the pot, in the west sky, had a star way below and about two degrees south.;2014-08-29 21:30:00;2 minutes;End tip of handle of Ursa Major, the pot, in the west sky, had a star way below and about two degrees south.  This night there was a very bright star between these two stars. The moon was way to the south with two stars/ planets below.   The new bright star thought to be a plane stayed in place.  I pointed my flashlight at i ( like that would do anything) then it looked like a dot within a circle, glowed brighter, then disappeared, as if a lightbulb glowed brightly then went out!   Or, if possible, like a sci-fi movie, it was a wormhole that closed or a star that exploded and vanished!  It may have looked like a fossile fuel ship flew straight away and got smaller as the distance grew.  This sighting was in the west end of the sky with Ursa Major located west/northwest.
