We had been sitting in a car for about 5-10 minutes and after already appreciating 2 lower flying airplanes in the night sky, we didn't know what to take of the object we were about to see. It became visible once passing a tree line a little in front of us. A round, bright orange orb-like object slowly hovered across the sky.  Unlike any other aircraft I've ever seen, the ONLY visible part of it was the one bright orange glow it gave off.  The light didn't flicker or dim, it was just a constant glow that moved eerily slow across the sky.  Even outside of the clouds in the clear sky it appeared only to be an orange glowing orb with a small trail kind of as if it was on fire.  As the object moved in the opposite direction of us it appeared to be losing most of its orangish glow and turning yellow/white and then disappeared very suddenly which also threw me! off.  Although I'm a believer in ufos and extraterrestrial life, im not one to be easily convinced that something is extraterrestrial nor would I concider reporting anything, but this sighting was way too abnormal for me to convince myself otherwise.;42.0991567567567;-87.9795905405404
Four flying objects that appeared and disappeared. I was in complete shock.;2013-02-15 19:00:00;1-2 minutes;four flying objects that appeared and disappeared. I was in complete shock. My fiance and I were at a gas station putting gas in.  I was sitting in the van looking at the stars because its was a clear night.  Out of nowhere 3 bright orange looking fire balls appeared out of nowhere.  My first thought was we were being under attack.  Sounds funny but you never know nowdays how thing have been.    But when I notice the objects flying slow, I got out the van and took a picture.  My fiance noticed them right away too.  I kept looking at the sky and the guy next to us and hid wife were stund.  The mans wife then noticed a forth one following the other three not to far behind.  As we were watching them fly slowly away, they were diappearing one by one.  We all couldn't think what just had happened.  I was really never a believer of ufos, until that night.  I have done researched about ufos since then and from what I saw that night other people as well have.  Thats a night I will never forget.;42.0991567567567;-87.9795905405404

My fiance and I were at a gas station putting gas in.  I was sitting in the van looking at the stars because it was a clear night and out of nowhere appears 3 bright orange lights in a row.  My first thought was maybe we were being under attack.   Sound funny but it scared me seeing those lights.  I get off the van and took a picture as well did my Fianc√©.  As I got off the van the man next to use notice me looking at the sky.  He was surprised as well. His wife noticed a forth light behind the 3.   As we were watching them move slowly the guys wife and I noticed that they were disappearing one by one.  It maybe lasted in total 2 minutes.   Even though it happened a few days ago I'm still in shock.  I can't believe I witness something like that.   I have Google and research on the image that i saw and what I found was that other people describe exactly what I even saw.   I am now a 100% believer.;42.0991567567567;-87.9795905405404
