It was a little past 9 pm, late December of 2012.  Me and a good friend were walking though our small town.  My friend is a skeptic of this sort of thing. All of a sudden he slows a down to stop and says, 'look at that'. I looked up, and could barely process what I had just seen. It was a massive, bright, white, and fast moving object. Rectangular in shape. And moving at hundreds of mph!  One of the many things that hit me about this craft, was it appeared to be moving right over our town, and low, at an unimaginable speed, yet it never made one sound. I would say it was the size of a football field, at least.  And then it just disappeared into the clouds. I tried to ask my skeptic friend why couldn't this by some plane, (even though I pretty much knew what it had to be). He said, 'um because it was going a million mph'!! One thing is for sure, I will never forget that night.;41.3552;-89.1753
