Orange light traveling from NE to SW at speeds comparable to satellites, there was no sound.;2018-11-21 20:30:00;1 minute;Orange light traveling from NE to SW at speeds comparable to satellites, there was no sound. I’m an amateur astronomer (been observing for several years now) and was testing out some new accessories for my telescope.  I had gone inside and when I came back out, that’s when I spotted the UFO.  It was already halfway across the sky, (I first saw it at the zenith) it was traveling from NE to SW in a straight line.   Its rate of travel was comparable to satellites you often see in the night sky.  However, it wasn’t small like a satellite.  The light was a rich orange and looked about the size of a streetlight you’d see while driving.  I believe it was at high altitude and no sound came from the object.   As stated in the beginning I was using my telescope that night, but saw the object with the naked eye.;38.9115000000001;-90.0378
