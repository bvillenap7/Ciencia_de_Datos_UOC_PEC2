As I was traveling northbound on hwy. 111, I noticed something flying in the air to my left (west).  The airport was to my right (east).   At this point, I figured that a small plane was going in for a landing except that as it came closer towards me (in the direction of the airport landing strips), it stopped abruptly!  The object seemed odd to me in that it was the size of a helicopter but the lights on in were in a triangle shape.  Red lights stayed on and white lights blinked (strobe like)…I rolled my window down thinking I would be able to hear it, if it was in fact a helicopter.  No such sounds, actually, there weren’t any sounds, which is very odd considering its proximity to the airport.  At this point, I slowed down considerably…to watch.  Once the object stopped in midair, it made a quick movement backwards for a short distance, then forward again.  Now I am really freaking out, I haven’t ever seen anything move like that.  I came upon my turn, pulled into a parking lot and when I looked back to see if the object was still there, it wasn’t.;38.9115000000001;-90.0378
