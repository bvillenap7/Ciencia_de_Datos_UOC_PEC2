Two bright lights, constantly changing color near Auburn, one ejecting a third object.;2019-05-06 21:00:00;30 minutes;Two bright lights, constantly changing color near Auburn, one ejecting a third object. Saw two ufo's tonight, possibly three, on the north-west side of Auburn, looking towards the west.  Two were up relatively high and a ways apart.  One was lower and closer.  They just looked like bright lights in the sky, but a bit too far away to make out actual shapes.  They were just hovering and flashing red, green, blue, yellow and white, we watched the lower one about 20 minutes or so, then it just disappeared.   The other was higher up and farther away, but looked the same as the other lower one, flashing different colors.   Then a solid reddish light seemed to come out of that one and flew off pretty fast, then it spread out into what looked like three lights, one solid red and a flashing white and red light. and flew off.  When we left where we were, the higher up one was still hovering there in the same spot.  There were 5 witnesses to this.;39.5962;-89.7428
