December 2006, Bright object, precision movement, flashing lights, two and a half hours.  ((NUFORC Note:  Twinkling star?  PD));2006-12-29 21:00:00;2.5 hours;(NUFORC Note:  Twinkling star?  PD)) December 2006, Bright object, precision movement, flashing lights, two and a half hours My husband and I were walking from our house to our studio, in the back yard.  I noticed how the stars were out and I was looking at the Little Dipper, I was facing south looking up.  Below the Little Dipper were two stars shining, to the left of those stars was a very bright object. The bright object was placed like:  X (Little dipper here)      . Star        . Star  		     *  object   ((NUFORC Note:  Design did not survive the transfer from the report form to our database.  PD)) As I stood there admiring the sky, the bright star like object started moving down and to the right a bit in a very precise motion ( in the shape of the letter L).   To make sure it wasn’t my eyes playing tricks on me I called my husband to the door of the studio.   I said look, at that bright object.  Is it moving to you?  He stated, wow, yes.    Soon after he sat down in the studio.  I continued to watch this object for the next two and a half hours. (9:00 p.m. to 11:30 p.m. central time).  It was a clear cool night, no winds.   During this time the object made small circles in the vicinity it was placed, it also moved up and down, left and right.  There is a very tall tree in the neighbors yard that I stood behind to watch the object.  I placed myself against my studio and watched the object move left and right up and down and at one point did a small circular move through the tree limbs.  I also stood in the back yard away from all trees and watched this object do the same movements.  My husband came out a couple times to view this object and he did say it was something moving up there.   Once we both saw what looked like a red flashing light from one side of the object. (Unlike any human aircraft).  I also observed several commercial airplanes doing their normal flights.  Non of them seemed to be aware or concerned that this object was there.  I could hear the commercial planes go by, I could hear the low faint rummble of the jet engines.  The planes were quite high.  I heard nothing from this object that seemed to hover the small city of Auburn.  I also kept an eye on the surrounding stars to see if there was a change in brightness or positions.  No change noticeable to the human eye. (Of course I did not have a telescope, I will be getting one now.)  I went into the studio for a bit to warm up, always looking out the window or door  to see if there was any change in what this object.  Within one hour the object had moved up to a  parallel position to the star on its  right.  Closer to 11:00 p.m. it looked like the object was fading, moving straight back, not up or down. The object began to dim, very slowly.  By 11:30 p.m. it looked as if it were a small spot in the sky, unlike it’s first bright lit form.  The movements I am describing from the object were not large movements.  Small and precise. While observing this object I will state again that no other stars had any of the features or characteristics  this object had and the stars never repositioned themselves.  I wanted to report it but because I did not have knowledge of what to do I did a little research on-line to find this website.  This morning just read a sighting reported by CNN.com in Chicago that happened there within the last 2 days.  Chicago is approximately 230 miles north of Auburn, IL straight up I - 55 North.  ((name deleted)) Auburn, IL 62615 ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));39.5962;-89.7428
