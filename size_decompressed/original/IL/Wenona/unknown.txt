Bright lights In Central Illinois;2002-08-19 05:45:00;10 minutes;Bright lights In Central Illinois I was traveling north on I-39 coming to the Lacon/Wenona exit. There was heavy thunderstorm. It was raining hard.  There was a great lightning show in the sky.  I noticed something the the sky - but when my eyes were diverted as I passed a semi and I went back to look it was gone.  It was then I noticed five bright lights in the to the west.  Five bright lights of different color.  They were just above the horizon and couldn't have been more than 2 miles away. Traffic was heavy and I couldn't believe I was the only one that saw these lights.  It was raining hard - lightning was constant.  I'm not saying what I saw were ships - I just haven't seen those lights before or since.  The lights didn't move - they were stationary ... there isn't anything out that way off Route 17 except farm land and farm houses. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.
