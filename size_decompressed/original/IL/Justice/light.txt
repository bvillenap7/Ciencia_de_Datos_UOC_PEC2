2 points of light, leaving light trail as they moved through the sky;1998-11-15 21:00:00;About 2-3 minutes;2 points of light, leaving light trail as they moved through the sky This happened when I was much younger, so I apologize for not having a more accurate date. I was out one night in my back yard hoping to observe a meteor shower. The night sky was clear, and several minutes after I went outside I observed 2 points of white light appear almost directly overhead, they began moving in a Southern direction in a straight line, they were moving in the same direction, and one slightly behind the other and to one side, as they moved they left a solid trail of light behind them. They contiued south for about 2 to 3 minutes covering about a 30-40 degree arc of the sky, at which point I came into the house to bring someone out, but nobody wanted to so a few moments later I stepped back outside to resume viewing, but the points of light and their trails were gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  The witness does not know even the correct year of the sighting.  PD));41.7489;-87.8324
