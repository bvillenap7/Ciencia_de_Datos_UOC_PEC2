On July 04, 2019, me and my fiancé ((name deleted)) was watching Fireworks at our Apartment In Justice, Illinois at 2158 when I noticed the following.  Two objects floating side by side slowly Coming from the West. The two objects were one solid color, but seems to be flicking.  They both slowly came from the West, then at one point stopped simultaneously, paused momentarily, and then proceeded Directly North. No more than at least two minutes passed before we saw another object, same color and all Moving slowly from the same West direction, come to the same spot where the previous  two objects had stopped.  It paused for about the same length of time, then proceeded on the same North heading as the previous Two objects. Almost immediately after the third object was out of sight, this forth object did not come to the same spot, pause and then head North.  It headed straight north and out of sight. My fiancé was only able to catch on video the third object. We both were bewildered and shocked!! ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the source of this report, and he sounded to us to be both sincere, and sober-minded.  We suspect that he is a very reliable witness.
