6 orange/red balls sighted in Justice, IL.;2015-07-04 21:54:00;20 seconds/4 minutes;6 orange/red balls sighted in Justice IL At 21:54 I sighted a red ball in the south at about 60 degrees up, slowly moving to the southwest.  I called my girlfriend to come outside.  By the time she came out she saw it fading away.   I looked to the left and pointed out a second fireball coming toward us from the southeast.  My girlfriend said it stopped for a couple of seconds and continued moving northwest.  We saw it about 30 seconds before it faded out or turned out its lights.   At 22:54, I went outside to see If I could see more.  Within a minute, I saw another orange/reddish ball coming towards me from the south.  I immediately called my girlfriend back out.  We both were standing on my porch watching it slowly moving toward the north.   It started to be blocked by my tree, so I went down my steps and kept backing up because I didn't want to lose sight of it.  It started to move towards the East and it came right over me.  My girlfriend yelled and said there was another one coming towards us.  I told her I didn't want to take my eyes off the one that was moving East.   Then she said there's 2 more.  I looked at her and she was pointing at two that were directly in the west at a decent distance.  I looked back up at mine and watched it fade away.  The second one went directly north and faded away.  The two out west, the one on the left was a little higher than the one on the right, faded into the distance.  The duration for the 22:54 sighting was about 4 to 5 minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));41.7489;-87.8324
