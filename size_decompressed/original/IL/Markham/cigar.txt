White object travels through morning sky.;2003-05-03 06:15:00;5 minutes;White object travels through morning sky. There was only one white spot in the sky.  From the distance from earth that it was at it was no larger then a pencil eraser.  I figure there is no way that it could be a plane cause first it was to high and a plane would have left an exhaust trail that high in the air.  It was a small cigar shaped object that from where I was it was moving south in the early morning.  It was a clear sky with a few clouds and it moved slowly as it passed overhead.  Then it was to far to make out anymore.;41.5997;-87.6905
