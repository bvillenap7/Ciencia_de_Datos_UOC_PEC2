Lights in the clear night sky over Swansea Illinois.;2013-10-19 20:10:00;5-7 minutes;Lights in the clear night sky over Swansea Illinois We were on our way home from dinner about 810pm when traveling in the sky from the southwest to the northeast were a group of red lights traveling in a row, but not in a straight line.   At first I thought they might be helicopters.   We pulled into the parking lot at Wolfbranch School and we both got out of the truck.  There were no flashing lights and no sound. Pretty strange....we watch the first group go by and either there lights were no longer visible to us or they disappeared one by one as they went away from us.  Then I looked to the southwest again and 2 more passed by us in the same way.   I called the Swansea Police department and they were going to notified Fairview Heights and O'Fallon to see if anyone else saw them.   I guess we both saw UFOs.   I hope there is some explanation for this event.;38.5317000000012;-89.9988000000011
