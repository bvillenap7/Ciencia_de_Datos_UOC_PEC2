Strange lights dancing in the sky.;1987-06-01 07:30:00;~5 minutes;Strange lights dancing in the sky. About 7:30 in the morning, my grandmother called me to come out on the back porch.  We observed three lights in the sky that seemed to be dancing around each other.  The lights were small and bright in the morning sky.   My grandmother went back in the house after about one minute since she notice these objects. I was totally amazed by them and could not take my eyes off them.   That night when I went to sleep I had some very strange dreams and woke up about three in the morning and got really sick to my stomach.  I dreamed about these things that looked to me like shadow people.   Its been a lot of years now and I still have these dreams and wake up very ill. I have had other very odd experiences about strange craft throughout the years that continue to this day. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Morning lights in the sky.;1987-06-15 07:00:00;20 minutes;Morning lights in the sky Around 8:30am, my grandmother had walked out on the back porch and called to me to come and look at three small lights in the sky.  They looked as if they were dancing around each other.  They were brightly colored white.   She had gone back inside after about a minute and I watched them for about 20 minutes.  I was totally amazed by what I was seeing.   I had a very strange dream that night about floating in the air and seeing these strange people in this room.  I also remember getting real sick the next morning.   I am 41 years old now and these dreams still continue and are becoming more frequent.  I have contacted other agencies and still have no answers.   If possible could you try to help me figure out what is going on please.

I was called to the back porch by my grandmother and she showed me the lights in the sky.  ((MO INVESTIGATORS GROUP REPORT.  PD));1988-06-01 06:30:00;15 minutes;Report taken by MISSOURI INVESTIGATORS GROUP. UFOMIG@yahoo.com I was called to the back porch by my grandmother and she showed me the lights in the sky.  There was three of them and they seemed to dance around each other.  I couldn't take my eyes off them.  It was like they wanted me to see them.  Ever since this incident I have dreams all the time about being in some sort of medical facility.  When I have these dreams I wake up the next morning with sever stomach pains and I get sick.  I also feel like I'm floating in the air sometimes right before I'm in the medical place.  I see other people there also but are unable to communicate with them.  I went to a doctor about the stomach sickness and they always say they cannot find anything after the test.  This has been going on know for a long time and I really need to know what is happening to me.;38.9092999999999;-90.1599999999999
This report is being entered for an aquaintance of mine who told me to contact this sight and inform you.  He saw that blue/green ball;1997-07-04 22:00:00;Few seconds;Summary : This report is being entered for an aquaintance of mine who told me to contact this sight and inform you.  He saw that blue/green ball on the 4th of July.  He explained pretty much what the radio reports had said.  He said most of his family saw it.  He explained what he saw without even hearing the radio report.  After he told me what he saw, I told him that he matched the reports.  He is POSITIVE that it wasn't an airplane or a firework.  Other than that, he has no idea.  It isn't really that big of a deal to him.  He could care less.  I just find this facinating. Here is an additional note:  One of the crew of radio station KMOX in St. Louis also saw the light in the sky.  He saw it while station out on the KMOX building balcony as he waited for the Fair St. Louis fireworks to begin.  Try and contact him for more info.  They have a website.  Just search for KMOX.  Thanks. Note:  I did not see it.;38.9092999999999;-90.1599999999999
