I watched a ship pass from my left to right, right in front of me.;2000-02-07 05:30:00;About 1 minute;I watched a ship pass from my left to right, right in front of me. A first I thought it was Vensus, but a few moments later it passed right in front of me, and Vensus was gone. The ship had 3 very bright lights, one at each corner. The ship was a little over the tree tops, moving very slowly. I was driving down the road at first but pulled over and shut the motor off. It passed right over me and I couldn't hear it. And also there was a blinking light but I,m not sure where. I was trying to see the ship it self, between the lights, but the light were to bright, they were all I could see. From were I first saw the ship to were I lost sight of it, the ship almost seemed to be following the course of the Mississippi river, as it never strayed very for from it.;38.9092999999999;-90.1599999999999
huge triangle shaped object with 3 extremely bright lights on bottom;2009-07-27 21:30:00;30 min;huge triangle shaped object with 3 extremely bright lights on bottom We saw a very,very bright ligh in the sky and didn't think too much of it,thought maybe a star or light on top of a tower or bldg,etc..as we drove another 15 min we the light got brighter and we were getting closer,realized it was not a light or star.It was hovering over the Clark bridge but high up.All of a sudden a Blue light on the left and a red light on the right faintly started blinking and the craft started moving.As itwas getting closer we could see that there were actually 3 bright white lights underneath in the shape of a triangle, as it went over us (we pulled over as did another car)you could see a huge,solid triangle shape (football field or bigger)The 3 bright lights on bottom suddenly went off and it kept going,abslolutly no noise, after several minutes the 3 bright lights came back on and it kept going but seemed to be getting higher in the sky as it went.;38.9092999999999;-90.1599999999999
