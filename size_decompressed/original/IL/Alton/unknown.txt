Two lights moving across the Illinois sky.;2010-07-09 23:00:00;1 minute;Two lights moving across the Illinois sky. At slightly after 11:00 P.M., I saw two lights moving across the sky. They moved in what appeared to be perfect unison, (as if the object(s) were two lights at diagonal corners on a sheet of glass, moving across the sky in a perfectly straight line).   This object came from the southeast heading northwest).  It didn't appear to be a craft, because you could see all of the stars above them as the object(s) passed under the stars orbit. The two lights did not blink I heard no sound from them and I automatically assumed that the object(s) were stars until I saw that the two lights were moving quickly, rather than being 'stationary.'
