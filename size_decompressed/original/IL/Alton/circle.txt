Light discovered in photo.;2009-03-30 11:30:00;unknown;Light discovered in photo. I was driving on my lunch break the morning of March 30th. I noticed a large X in the sky made by jet trails and snapped a couple photos on my phone. I was reviewing them yesterday and noticed a strange light in one of them. I uploaded them to the computer and zoomed in. I'm not sure of other explanations for this effect, if not made by some physical object in the sky. I'd love to hear some feedback to how legitimate this photo may be.;38.9092999999999;-90.1599999999999
