eleven cylinder objects seen over chicago suburbs in illinois;2009-05-30 23:00:00;10 min;eleven cylinder objects seen over chicago suburbs in illinois 11 people witnessed three lights moving north to south, around eleven pm after they passed eight other objects followed the same flight path as the first three. The eight other ones were a lot clearer to be seen they looked like the cylinder of a revolver with a ghost like glow to them the movement was kind of like a wobble or tumble, some of the guests described them to look like angels. What I seen had anywhere from five to eight lights in the rear. The only good example I have is if you ever seen jellyfish or squid and the way light reflects off of them under water it was very strange and life changing to me. The sky was very clear that night, and these objects moved with no sound. The ages of the people were forteen to forty one, and all of us prior to the sighting were all sceptics on ufos, that's not the case now. None of us were intoxicated, and all of us are having a hard time trying to reason all of this. Thanksele;41.4716;-87.6355
