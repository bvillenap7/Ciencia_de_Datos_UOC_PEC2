revolving diamond (football) like, fast, noiseless, three sided with 3 green lights per side.  Chicago bound.;1982-06-12 22:30:00;3 seconds;revolving diamond (football) like, fast, noiseless, three sided with 3 green lights per side.chicago bound one craft heading north towards chicago (navy based near there)revolving clockwise slowly with three green lighted ports or dot like in appearance florescent like color, on three sides shaped nearly like a football. The space in between the lights were black and featureless. The ends were lightless and not much difference except a possible larger back end but not sure.The ufo produced no sound whatsoever. The craft was on a horizon track like following  the arc of the city lighted horizon where it turns blue to black sky. The craft was going at a steady fast pace that lasted no more than three seconds as I had sighted it to my right and followed it as far I could see it go to the left or north before leaving my field of vision. I had three other friends at the time with me but I could not even remark within that time of what I saw besides the ridicule I would have gotten with a mention of what I saw. As of this writing of this I am considering attempting making a paper mache replica of this since I still have a very vivid memory in my head of this occurance and desire to understand the craft and its movements like I have never have seen by any craft before or since by someone that used to work at an airport and know of planes fast and slow and none have ever compared to the speed and movement of said ufo that I had witnessed that life altering night.....there are other people in the skies and foolish are the people who do not believe in other life.;41.4716;-87.6355
