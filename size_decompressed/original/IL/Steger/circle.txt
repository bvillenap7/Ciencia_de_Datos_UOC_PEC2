One bright orb going East while a much dimmer one went South/West.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible satellites??  PD));2010-04-28 09:20:00;2-3 minutes;One bright orb going East while a much dimmer one went South/West My friend had just dropped me off at my house from band practice.  Practice ended at nine o’clock and it was about 9:20-9:25 at the time.  I walked up my driveway and noticed that I could see the stars very clearly. I leaned against the van and looked at them for a while facing south. I saw a plane, it was clearly a plane and it was flashing going North/East.  Let me be clear: it was obviously a plane.  Any regular person would look at it and say that it was a plane. By comparison the next two objects I saw did not look anything like the flashing plane. I looked at a brighter star and then it began to go North after a couple seconds, it hadn’t gone very far, it sharply went East. It was a bright orb. Before I could see it leave my field of vision I was distracted by a much dimmer orb going South/West. I watched this until it left my field of vision. I stayed for another minute or two and then came inside. When I started typing this it was about 9:35.;41.4716;-87.6355
