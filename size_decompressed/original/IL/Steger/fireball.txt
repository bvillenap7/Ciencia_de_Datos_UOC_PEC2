My two friends and I were sitting on my friend's backyard deck, enjoying the summer evening, in Steger, IL (approx. 35 miles south of Chicago).   The sky was relatively clear, some clouds in the distance, but not where we saw it.   I looked up at the sky, and all of a sudden in the center of it, I could see a yellow round light, about the size if you put your index finger together with your thumb, sort of like a okay sign, that was the size of it.   It wasn't going down it was going west to east.  It was followed by a fire trail.  This did not appear to be a shooting star because it was much bigger.  It was even bigger than planes that you'd see at night.   While this was happening, I exclaimed to my friends (aw, look at that), my one friend saw it but by the time my other friend got up, it was gone.   About ten minutes later, my friend that saw it with me, saw it again, this time going south to north.   I would say that if you were to take a yard stick and put it up to the sky, that is about the distance that it traveled.;41.4716;-87.6355
