Strange triangle ship petrifies me and ruins my cd player.;2005-06-16 01:00:00;A few minutes;Strange triangle ship petrifies me and ruins my cd player. This is my second sighting, but this time a different object, and ALOT bigger. It looked atleast the size of a football field, but more square on the bottom. I was sitting at the front of my garage with the door open and my, my huge speakers were on really loud playing Guns N' Roses - Night Train, then the triangular shaped thing came from the sky, I'm really just guessing it was triangular shaped because it was cloudy, and all i could see was the bottom half, but it angled in like a triangle. It was spinning kind of slowly, it had 3 bright blue lights under it, and it had blue lights moving around all over it, kind of how the white strips are on a microchip, but they pulseated, and i was petrified in my chair, i seriously couldnt move, I tried to get my camera but i was stiff in my lawn chair at the edge of the garage. then the blue lights under the triangle turned white for about the last minute it was there, then it made a loud tornado siren like noise and it dissapeared, then finally i was un petrified and i looked back at my cd player and it was steaming, i went back to open it and rescue my cd before it melted and the cd player was jammed shut!
