Noticed an object in the eastern sky moving north about 45o above the horizon.  Estimate total time of visualization about 10 seconds, then it faded out behind a cloud. It had a red glow and was round.  The travel was in a straight line, the color and glow didn't very (no blinking as does an aircraft).  One person took a picture of it with a phone camera, just a red dot. If it was the size of an aircraft, it was moving much faster than a jet plane.  To compare its size to a celestial object, I'd say it was about four times the size of Venus.;41.6142;-87.5515
