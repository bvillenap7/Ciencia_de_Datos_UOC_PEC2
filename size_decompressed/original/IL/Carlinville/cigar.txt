The bottom of the object had red and white lights alternately flashing. It was a cloucy night and the object was flying very low underneath the cloud cover.  I was too scared to pull over as I was the only vehicle in a basically cornfield expanse of land.  The object initially was flying northbound at a rather quick pace and then suddenly about 10 miles up the road (I was westbound) I saw the same object to my left traveling westbound still at a rather quick speed.  It was probably a mile or so away from my vehicle at all times.  I watched it travel westbound for the next 8 miles or so and then I lost it in the cloud cover.  I did not roll down my window to check for any noises. I observed no interferences with my radio at all.  I did not observe the object switching from northbound to westbound so I guess it could have been two different objects.  I am a professional and would never lie or exaggerate anything about something this scary.;39.2901;-89.8675
