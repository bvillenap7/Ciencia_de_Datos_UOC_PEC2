Four females driving south witnessed a orange light in the eastern sky.   Upon driving six miles the orange light, now in the south changed to red.   Upon turning the car north and driving into wooded road the red object changed white and was pulsating large orb to small orb.   It continued to hover over our vehicle as we drove from north to east.  Approximately two football fields away.  Upon stopping the car at a clearing to take a picture, the object split from one large white orb into two equal but separate orbs and blinked out into darkness.;39.2901;-89.8675
