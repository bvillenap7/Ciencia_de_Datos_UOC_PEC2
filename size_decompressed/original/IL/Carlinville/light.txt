Illinois 2 Perfect Circles and 2 Figure 8's inside the same circle, 10 Second elapsed time;2010-12-23 21:15:00;30 seconds;Illinois 2 Perfect Circles and 2 Figure 8's inside the same circle, 10 Second elapsed time Cold and Clear about 35 degrees.  I went outside to look at the stars around 9:15 Central Time.  On my way back in, out of the corner of my right eye, I saw a light in the sky bounce up and down.  I stopped and turned to the Northwest at about 288 degrees (GE Image emailed).  I waited for no more than a minute when, what I thought was a Star, made a perfect circle about 3 inch diameter at arms length, starting downward.  The light came to a dead stop for a split second right where it started, then proceeded to make a horizontal Figure 8 inside the same diameter of the circle.  It stopped again where it started, then did a reverse Figure 8, stopped dead again and then created the same perfect circle in the opposite direction.  Elapsed time of the movements was about 10 seconds total from start of the circle to the final stop.  Light was slightly smaller than a ballpoint pen clicker button. approximately 25 degrees elevation from ((address deleted)) Orient Street, our old garage was used as a viewing angle and stability platform.  I waited for about 5 minutes but it never moved again, so I went back inside.  Sighting also reported to MUFON in 2014.;39.2901;-89.8675
