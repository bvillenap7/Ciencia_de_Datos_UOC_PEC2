Translucent ballon-like moving slowly.  ((anonymous report));2019-06-19 20:30:00;30 minutes;Translucent ballon-like moving slowly Son noticed bright object in western sky.  It looked similar to how a bright planet looks before dusk in the evening sky.  First I got binoculars and still couldn’t really see any features.  Then got out a small Bushnell telescope and then could easily see its features. Then noticed a second one in the north-northwest sky.  The two objects were the same thing.  They both moved slowly west through the telescope eyepiece similar to the moon moving through it.  I did not have to re-focus the telescope when moving from one object to the other.  They looked like white-ish glowing translucent balloons.  There seemed to be a small ring of white lights at one end that slowly shifted or moved.  The “balloon” almost seemed to rotate and change slightly also while moving through the telescope.  There were no quick or sudden movements.  We watched them for about 30 minutes before they disappeared behind a cloud bank. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));39.2901;-89.8675
