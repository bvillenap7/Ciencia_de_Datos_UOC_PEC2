8 Triangular Orange Lights Moving North to South on 12/24/12 @ 5:15pm CST in Lake Barrington, IL;2012-12-24 17:15:00;8 minutes;8 Triangular Orange Lights Moving North to South on 12/24/12 @ 5:15pm CST in Lake Barrington, IL My wife & I observed an orange flickering object in the night sky moving north to south.  As I visually followed it into the southern sky, I noticed 3 more in front of it in a singular line & all moving from north to south.  As I looked north, I noticed more of them coming, travelling in the same southbound direction & all at the same speed without any type of sound. I snapped a few pictures of them with my camera/phone. After the event, I uploaded them into my computer. In one of the pictures I zoomed in & its shape is definitely triangular. It was blinking so fast it was unnoticeable to the naked eye & a few of the pictures show only a slight trail of light without any object.;42.1597;-88.1414
