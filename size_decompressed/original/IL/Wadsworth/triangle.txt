I was looking for a meteor shower and I spotted (1) black triangle aircraft flying southwest at a low altitude.  It had three white lights on the points.  It was moving about the speed of a commercial aircraft but definitely was not a plane or jet.   I wanted to film it, but it was too fast to think about it and open my camera on my phone.  I have never seen anything like this. Feel free to contact me via email.;42.4463;-87.9085
