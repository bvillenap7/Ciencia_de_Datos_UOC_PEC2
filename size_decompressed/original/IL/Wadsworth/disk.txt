It was just flying around in the night as if it was looking for something in the area.   There was one saucer I saw.  The saucer was a silverish color and had a yellowish-green aura flashing around it.  Moving left and right, up and down, forward and backwards, swaying motion zig zag and diagonal.   There was a slight flash of light I saw.;42.4463;-87.9085
