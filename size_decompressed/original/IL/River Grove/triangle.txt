I could make out a contour line that looked like a flat triangle shape object.  The brighter light became dimer while the other became brighter, the light hovered over the ground for around 2-3 minutes and then disappeared completely.   The sky had some clouds, but normal airplanes coming from O'Hare airport were easily seen and recognized, but that thing had way to bright lights to be an airplane.   Also, as an Army Veteran I know that lights do not just hover in the sky for 3 minutes.;41.9277;-87.8439
