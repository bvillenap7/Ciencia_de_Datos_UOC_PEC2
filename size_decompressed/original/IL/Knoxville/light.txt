Bright orange lights seen by a family of 4 in rural Knoxville, Illinois.;2019-04-16 21:30:00;08:00;Bright orange lights seen by a family of 4 in rural Knoxville, Illinois. On the evening of April 16, 2019, at approximately 9:30pm CST, I was driving my van south on Knox Station Rd in rural Knoxville, IL, when I noticed what I originally thought were fireworks in the sky.  These lights appeared to be very high in the sky, possibly ½ mile in altitude.  I asked my husband his opinion of what they were.  Both of my children, 15 and 11 were also in the vehicle.  We pulled over on the side of the road, where both of my children exited the vehicle to begin recording the strange phenomenon.  My husband also began recording the lights in the sky from inside the vehicle.  There were two large orange lights that would leap in equal intervals from one and other.  Each would leave a tail of smaller orange dots and then disappear for approximately ½ of a second before reappearing and leaping west again.  The lights would make a rapid movement and then stop.  At one point both of the larger lights collided and went dark.  Again within a split second the! lights reappeared with the tails of smaller lights and began moving westward again.  As we proceeded South on Knox Station Road, the lights never appeared to become closer.  They were very bright and were very apparent in the night sky even with a cell phone tower below them and a ¾ moon.  At approximately 9:38 pm CST, the lights vanished from the sky.;40.9126;-90.2845
