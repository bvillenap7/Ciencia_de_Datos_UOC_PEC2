On august 4, 1996 between 7-7:30am on a bright sunshiny day with a slight moring haze. I went out to the south of my home to take some snapshots of landscape material for future paintings. I had taken several shots at different locations before I arrived at this location. Approximately 5 miles south of Knoxville Illinois. I parked at a T intersection where I saw some large haybales and thought this would make for a good shot. I took EXP.#18 looking south. I then turned and took a shot to the west. Then I turned and walked to the intersection and took a shot to the north then I turned and walked a little way to the south and took EXP.#21. I did not know the object in these two exposures were there till I had the film developed. My concentration was mainly on the ground. The object in EXP#18 is approximately 1/3 of a mile away. The object in EXP#21 had moved off to the south east away from me. The time span between EXP#18 and EXP#21 was approximately 3 to 5 minutes. I am a graphic artist for the Maytag Corporation and have been employed there for 40 years. I paint landscapes for a hobby. I'm married with two grown children. I am sending you 2 images that I have blown up copies of. They will be sent via email from ((E-mail address deleted))t. Thank you for your time.;40.9126;-90.2845
