I wonder if anyone will believe what I just saw!;2002-08-21 22:05:00;7seconds;I wonder if anyone will believe what I just saw! I was sitting out on my front porch at around 10:05p.m.talkin across the yard with my neighbor lady. Suddenly, I noticed a bright blue fire like object come across the sky from the northwest to the southeast. It was rounded in the front.  I yelled at my neighbor to look, but by the time she got turned around it had passed on behind the trees.  It was blue in the front with colors of yellowish, green, white mix behind it. I knew this could not be fireworks of any kind, because of the way it was traveling across the sky.  And, I have never witnessed a falling star that looked like that. There was an airplane in the distance behind that had it's lights flash as usual, so I know it wasn't a plane. I'm not quite sure what it was, but I have never seen anything like it before.;40.9126;-90.2845
