The object would move horizontally across the atmoshpere, but no way to measure depth or speed.   Looked out of our planets atmosphere and looked very bright while moving, but became dim or even transparent when stoppped but process of moving happened while lite then would stop.  For a different amount of time each time.  Was same size as the average star visible to stars size in big dipper.  I am not an astonomer or a good speller but what we saw was definetly not seen before and there was no way to make sense of it.  Not like any comet or astroid I have seen plenty of those.   This was not falling it was traveling!;41.7295;-87.8327

It appeared to me that it was a flying fireball and I called my wife and daughter to confirm what I have seen.  All three of us watched it drift through the sky then slowly drop. It was moving from East to West for about thirty seconds.;41.7295;-87.8327
