I noticed four fast moving lights in the sky. They would come together and meet in the middle continually moving and then branch out as if pushing away from one another. They stayed a certain distance from eachother as if coming from four corners of a diamond. I was talking at the time to a friend in the same building. I asked him to hang up and come up to see. He observed the movement for over five minutes. I then reported this to the police. A car was immediately sent out and it patroled right under where the lights were spinning. The lights then went out. The lights appeared to be over the clouds and not circular, they were a bit like large feathers, wide and flat looking. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the witness may have been observing an advertising light, which was based on laser projection.  PD));41.4418;-87.7114
