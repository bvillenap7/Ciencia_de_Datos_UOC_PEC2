Two orange balls in sky moving east to west about 5k feet up in sky;2014-10-18 21:29:00;5-10 minutes;Two orange balls in sky moving east to west about 5k feet up in sky. Looking to east we saw two large orange lights in sky.  Looked to be about height we would expect Helicopters to fly.  They slowly moved west towards us then changed direction to the east.   One of them went first then the other one changed direction.   Speed of movement was similar to that of a Helicopter in search mode.   I saw many helicopters when I lived in Ft. Campbell.  I never saw them in night sky as orange balls of light. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));39.9124;-89.5828
