Thinking that was strange i kept my eyes on the sky and saw another light appear south of the first one, it moved for awile flashed then disappeared.  The third one appeared after the first two vanished,it flew the lowest and longest time.  Thought ok, this one was a plane, but had no flashing lights or noise, then it got bright white...flashed, then was gone.
