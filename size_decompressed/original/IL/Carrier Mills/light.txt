Flashing colored light in sky disappears.;2012-05-24 20:55:00;5 Minutes;Flashing colored light in sky disappears. I was in my car with 2 others on the way to town.  Someone said that they thought they could see Mars so we all loooked out of the windows and opened the sunroof.  When we opened the sunroof we all saw something in the sky that was moving fast and changing colors.  I was about to turn and we decided to follow it.  We lost it behind a tree for a second and then it was gone.  I saw it change from red to orange to green to purple.;37.6804;-88.6325
