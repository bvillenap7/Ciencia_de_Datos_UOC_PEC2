No real detail 99% of the time with some brilliant exceptions. I routinely see UFO's in the Chicago skies.  On this particular night I saw at least seven from approx. 21:30 to 22:30 hrs.  What I have observed is that in that time frame from one to three objects come in from the south going north and decend at the same place every time I observe this (between hwy 83 and 355).  I can only guess but if these objects are in fact landing the only place where there is any cover to the north within that corridor is a large forest preserve - Busse Woods which is about 15-20 miles to the north.  I use a 10X-50 Nikon binocular to track these objects.  Last night as I was following one going north I observed another much higher going to the south cross in my field of view.  This is so common with a few observations being so remarkable all one has to do is position a time-lapse camera in the night sky and capture the traffic jam in the Chicago skies.;41.8003;-87.9587
