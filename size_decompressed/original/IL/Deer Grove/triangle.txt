We were standing on a hill and I looked up towards the trees, and saw a very bright light. We looked closer, and it was 3 very bright lights in triangular form (triangular craft) It didnt look too far away, and was close to the ground, and did not appear to be moving. After a few minutes it started to slowly hover towards us. We got very scared and ran behind some trees and watched it get closer. We watched it for a few minutes, and the VERY NEXT MOMENT we were not where we were the very moment before, we were standing together on top of the hill where we were before ducking behind the trees, looking straight up in the sky, watching a jet at NORMAL elevation flying overhead. Did not have a watch, but missing time associated with abduction was probably accountable for the experience.;41.6344;-89.6991
