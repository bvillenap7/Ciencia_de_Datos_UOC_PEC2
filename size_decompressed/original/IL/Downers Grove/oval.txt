Im a normal, level headed person, and what i saw that night absolutely freaked me out beyond belief. Me and two friends were just hagning outside my house, when all of a sudden i looked up and saw the most bizzare thing I have ever seen.  This blueish/purple ball with spinning rotating neon rings was just hovering just over the trees in a manner i have never seen. It didnt look like a convential ufo, or a blimp, or plane, and it was eerily silent.  It looked like something from another world!  The thought that it was some type of conventional aircraft never even crossed my mind. I instantly just knew I was looking at something completely out of place. The three of us just freaked out. My friends went to chase it, and I ran inside to get my dad. By the time I came out, they lost it. We were about to go inside, when we saw a a blimp that said 'sanyo'. Traveling in normal blimp fasion, headed westward over I-88.  We then brushed this off as what we saw all along, feeling stupid for waking up my dad, and thinking we saw a ufo.  The wierd thing is we never mentioned it again. 5 years have passed since then, and Im not convinced that what we originally saw was a blimp. Common sense and logic say that it was a blimp that we first saw, but  I know what I saw, and still believe we saw two different objects that night.;41.7839198275863;-88.0100439655172
