Flying saucer traveling through the sky in the middle of the day!;1970-06-06 00:00:00;5-10 min;Flying saucer traveling through the sky in the middle of the day! I may not be remembering the year or date correctly, but I remember what I saw very clearly. I was about 7 years old. My brother and I were walking downtown. We were on Warren Ave., one block west of Forest, on the north side of the street. We looked up and saw what appeared to be a something in the shape of what is now termed a flying saucer. It was probably as high up as how high single-engine airplanes fly. We didn't believe what we were looking at so we stopped a male adult who was passing by and pointed it out to him. We asked him what it was. He looked up and was as amazed as we were. He said, I think it's a UFO. As children, my brother and I had no idea what that meant. We kept repeating those letters until we returned home and asked our parents what those letters meant. (Of course, nobody believed us when we related what we had seen.)

Orange disc above Downers Grove, IL;2001-06-22 21:00:00;30 seconds;Orange disc above Downers Grove, IL The moon was just barely a crescent-shaped sliver that night, so it was a very dark sky.  I could see a lot of stars, I could see Mars very brightly in the southern sky (Mars was not moving of course!) I looked directly above my head and saw a bright orangeish disc-shaped object floating along in the sky from east to west at a very steady speed, but not very fast.  We are close to O'Hare International Airport so I can easily distinguish a plane or jet flying at night as opposed to, well something that's not a plane!  This object flew along for about twenty seconds then went behind a tree from my point of view....the object never reappeared!!! I know what satellites look like in the night sky, this was too big to be a satellite.  It was not a plane because planes have flashing lights and planes are not orange and circular!  Also, as I mentioned before I realize where Mars was that night.  I assure you I was not looking at Mars.  Mars was in the southern sky, this object was directly above me.  This object was surprisingly bright as well.  The orange color was not a dark orange but rather a lighter brighter orange. ??? ((NUFORC Note:  Source is anonymous.
