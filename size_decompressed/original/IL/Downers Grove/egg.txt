I pushed away the curtains to let some light in. I decided to take a look outside.  When I was looking down the street, something caught my eye.  In the corner of my eye, there was a white dot.  I looked up into the sky to see a figure floating above.   At first I thought was a plane or blimp, but then I made out its shape.  It was very odd looking. It was in the shape of a mailbox.  Its main color was white.  Even though the figure was far away, it was pretty big.  From how far away it was, it was about the shape of a labrador retreiver.  But if it was close up, it would be bigger than that.two thin black lines went across it and made an X on the flying object.  The thin X overlapped a cross shape on the object with two thick red lines.  It went at the same speed as a plane, but then it swerved sharply to the left.  It passed by my window after two minutes.  I have read up about UFO sightings, but none of them described what I saw.   When I saw the object in the sky, I was astonished.;41.7839198275863;-88.0100439655172
