Ball of fire travels at steady speed across the sky.;2012-08-17 21:30:00;3 minutes;Ball of fire travels at steady speed across the sky. I observed the object moving from south to north at a constant speed.  The object did not appear to be floating or falling.  The object appeared to be approximately 300 to 500 feet above our heads.  It was basically round in shape but did appear to slightly change form.  It was an amber colored object that appeared to have subtle changes in its hues.   After it traveled north for approximately two minutes it changed direction and then traveled up and directly away from us.  I could tell it was moving away and not standing still as it slowly got smaller until it disappeared.  It appeared that the object never changed speeds nor did it appear to be affected by any wind or air currents.  None of us heard any noise emitting from the object.;41.7839198275863;-88.0100439655172
silent orange ball of fiery light over Downers Grove, Illinois;2016-07-02 22:30:00;3 minutes;silent orange ball of fiery light over Downers Grove, Illinois My boyfriend and I were outside after cooking out. Some neighbors down the street were doing fireworks. After they finished, I looked in the other direction and noticed a large orange fiery orb moving towards us.  I grabbed my boyfriend and said, uhhhh, what is THAT?! we both stood there watching. This orange ball of light, which looked fiery, was coming from the west of the sky.  It moved slowly, made NO SOUND, and hovered through the sky. It came in our direction, and then made a sudden complete 90 degree turn, heading north. It was hovering slowly, silently, and then literally zipped out of sight like lightning.  The entire event was less than three minutes.  It was too high in the atmosphere to be residual fireworks and nobody was doing any fireworks at the exact time this happened.  It absolutely was NOT AN AIRPLANE. we stood there, completely dumbfounded.;41.7839198275863;-88.0100439655172
5-7 org/red ORBS flying towards City of Chicago from Suburbs;2020-07-28 21:03:00;2-3 minutes;5-7 org/red ORBS flying towards City of Chicago from Suburbs It was 9:03pm Tues July 28th. I was sitting on patio in backyard facing south talking to a relative who was facing north.  I was looking up at the sky as I often do watching the planes fly into the city when I suddenly saw one solid orange/red ball of light appear as though it came from the southwest heading East towards Chicago. Growing up directly under one of the many flight paths to one of the busiest airports, ohare, ive seen my fair share of planes. These were no usual aircraft/helicopter/drone. No blinking lights to indicate aircraft. It was not a meteor or comit there was no tail/debris trail. The first one flew in our line of sight for approx. 30 sec before shrinking to a tiny speck in the night sky (on the same horizontal plane as it appeared.). As the first one vanished, two more appeared flying in the exact same trajectory as the one previous. Same speed, same altitude.  One about a thumbs length in front of the other (if holding thumb out sidewa! ys up to the sky). Those two repeated the same as the first, passing before us in a perfectly horizontal line as they diminished to specks as quickly as they had appeared. Best way I can describe it read as though they materialised/dematerialized by illuminating/extinguishing. They appeared to head in the direction of the city but never descending - 2 more appeared. Same path, same distance apart same everything. Then two more and same thing. It appeared as though once they got closer to the city the went from solid orbs of light to specks instantaneously. Was able to see them through binoculars but couldnt identify anything more then orange/red glowing orbs. We were left dumbfounded by what we saw. Hope someone else besides us got to see it also!;41.7839198275863;-88.0100439655172
