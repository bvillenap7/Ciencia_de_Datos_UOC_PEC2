Object decellerated, stopped, hovered, and then accellerated upward at fantastic rate of speed.;2004-01-22 17:30:00;30 seconds;Object decellerated, stopped, hovered, and then accellerated upward at fantastic rate of speed. On Thursday, 22 January 2004 at 1730 CST, (Clear skies, no clouds) as I stood on my deck at home, I observed a glowing white light, moving ENE at approximately 15,000 feet altitude. The size of the light was estimated as the size of a pencil eraser held at arms length. The light was similar to those I have seen in the past- We live underneath a major air corridor directly south of O'Hare and directly west of Midway airports in suburban Chicago. Southbound aircraft departing O'Hare were operating in the area at 5000-7500 feet, and westbound aircraft departing Midway were also in the area, flying over the O'Hare traffic.  The object was above both flight paths of the jets. At the time of this incident, the object flew high over an MD-80 aircraft departing O'Hare. The object had no red and green running lights, or white anti collision strobes, or landing lights normally seen on aircraft in this area. It entered my vision from above and decellerated and stopped moving, about two miles downrange of my position. Then, the object blinked out, and after a second, rapidly reappeared as a star-like object and accellerated upward at an angle similar, and resembling a curve ball thrown by a baseball pitcher, only upwards.  I have seen this type of object in the Chicago area, several times in the past two years. It decellerates, hovers and accellerates at an angle with amazing speed. It was ABSOLUTELY NOT an aircraft, as I am quite familiar with aircraft, having worked as an airline executive.;41.7839198275863;-88.0100439655172
Five red lights pass in formation over DuPage County IL, from North to South , on Jan 13 at 9:20 pm.;2005-01-13 21:20:00;10 seconds;Five red lights pass in formation over DuPage County IL, from North to South , on Jan 13 at 9:20 pm. A formation of five red lights passed over Downers Grove, IL at approximately 9:20 pm CST on Jan 13th. The formation consisted of three red lights (one behind the other in the direction of travel) on the western side of the formation, and two red lights (one behind the other in the direction of travel) on the eastern side of the formation. The group of lights were in bowling pin formation, not a chevron formation.  The lights had approximately 2-3 degrees of arc separation between each of them. Each light was a diffuse red disc, approximately 0.2 degrees of arc in diameter.  All the lights were uniform in color and size, and had a constant intensity. They moved in exactly a straight line, at constant velocity, from the North-Northeast to the South-Southwest. It took approximately 8-9 seconds for the group of five lights to travel from directly over head to approximately 30 degrees above the horizon. No noise was observed. The sky was very clear-no clouds, or haze. The ambient was approximately 15 F. No shape, glow, or shadow was visible between the red lights.  I am an amatuer astronomer. This was a naked eye sighting. I was looking at the Pleides and Orion, when I noticed the group of lights moving rapidly overhead. I have seen high and low altitude plane lights, satellites, and meteors, but I have never seen anything like this pass overhead across the night sky before.;41.7839198275863;-88.0100439655172
Large, glowing bluish/white object glides eastbound over northern Illinois and Chicago.;2007-06-05 21:35:00;3-4 minutes;Large, glowing bluish/white object glides eastbound over northern Illinois and Chicago. While speaking on my cellphone and watching arriving and departing aircraft from O'Hare and Midway airports, I noticed at my WSW position heading ENE, a very bright spherical bluish-white light, (half the size of my index finger at arms-length)at approximately 20,000 ft.  The object was glowing and had no landing, anti-collision or red /green running lights, left no contrail and made no noise.   It flew over aircraft departing Midway and arriving at O'Hare and under eastbound aircraft cruising at high altitude south of my position.  I estimate the speed to be x3 of 737 aircraft flying directly over me westbound, at approximately 7,500 ft. <250kts.. The object silently glided over the city of Chicago and disappeared over Lake Michigan.   Note: This was a very clear night and running lights on all aircraft even at crusing altitude, were seen without difficulty.  I was nervous as I saw the object as I have seen these before..   End UFO secrecy NOW!!!;41.7839198275863;-88.0100439655172
Two bright lights in sky that almost hit then turned and went in various directions at high rate of speed.;2010-08-26 08:30:00;2 minutes;Two bright lights in sky that almost hit then turned and went in various directions at high rate of speed. At about 8:30 Thus 8/26/10 my wife and I witnessed two bright white lights.  One was coming from the south toward the road we were traveling on.  The other came from the north. Initally I thought it was two planes and I told my wife that they are going fast toward one another and they were going to hit. They came very close in front of us down the road (up in the sky) and almost hit...then the one that came from the north turned and headed due west at a high rate of speed.  The other light stopped and turned and headed south at a high rate of speed.  The lights were circular a bright blue/white twice the size of a planet in the night sky.  I know these were not planes or helicopters.;41.7839198275863;-88.0100439655172
