Green and White Lights in Formation Over Strip Mall;2005-06-17 00:20:00;2 Minutes;Green and White Lights in Formation Over Strip Mall I was in the Drive Thru for a late night snack after a movie (one that i frequently go too) and i noticed through the tree line ahead of me there were some green and white glowing lights that were very bright. It looked like when a firework shoots up and it bright green but it was just sittin there and rocking side to side very subtly. Also I noticed a police officer immediately pull into the parking lot ahead and another one go down a road ahead right under where the object would have been. The second I received my food and pulled out in the exact spot about a couple hundred to 1000 yards in front 100ft up where i had seen the lights there was nothing. On the way home from the restaurant I saw several state troopers and police vehicles parked in a lot outside of there cars talking with one another. I wonder if someone else might have seen this because it is a heavily populated area near Chicago.;41.7839198275863;-88.0100439655172

Appeared in the sky moving west to east over Downers Grove, Il.  Moving fast but silently.  Appx. 20:58.  First white one appeared alone followed momentarily by four others of various colors in a sort of triangular pattern and maybe minute and a half later by last solid white one.  Best guess altitude appx. 20/30 thousand feet.  Hard to tell at night.;41.7839198275863;-88.0100439655172
