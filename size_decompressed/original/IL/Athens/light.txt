Orange and green lights on a dark obj. with no obvious noise, no obvious wings and no propellers;2015-11-23 18:30:00;<5 minutes;Orange and green lights on a dark object with no obvious noise, no obvious wings and no propellers I have seen this pale orange color light on two other occasions in the same basic area in the October/November timeframes only this time it was at the top of the tree line and crossing over the road I was on.   As it got closer to my car I could vaguely see underneath it.  It had either blue or green lights on the left and right of the orange ball and underneath it was dark colored.  It did not appear to have any landing gear or anything.  It didnâ€™t look like any type of aircraft I had ever seen before so it is hard to describe it.    I could not tell the overall shape of it because of the dark color in the dark sky.  I did not hear any noises from it and did not see any obvious wings or propellers.    It went slowly over the top of my car and then disappeared.  It was in the Northwest sky this time but has previously been Northeast.  This time it seemed like it was within 50-100 ft of the ground.  If I see it again I will try to get a picture.;39.9932;-89.6664
