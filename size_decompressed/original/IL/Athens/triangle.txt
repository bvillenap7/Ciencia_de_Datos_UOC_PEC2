Triangular UFO turns into 2.;2012-01-10 22:00:00;2 minutes;Triangular UFO turns into 2. Approximately 10pm on January 10, 2012, I was driving my car eastbound through town in Athens, IL.  I looked out of my window (south) and seen a very low flying object, about tree top high.  We are about 15 minuets from the airport in Springfield, IL, so my first instinct was that it was a plane, until it got closer.   I notified the passengers in the car to look out their windows on the opposite side of the vehicle as we came to a stop in the road and we all three watched out the windows.   As it moved over the top of us, we realized that this object was triangular shaped and had lights on each point of the triangle and was not moving at a very fast speed for a normal plane.   As we continued to watch, the object moved onward then turned into two seperate objects and took off extremely fast across the sky in two opposite directions.  One went northeast and one went west.   This was not the first UFO sighting I have seen, the first happened around 1999 just north of Petersburg, IL, at approximately 9pm (3 witnesses), but this UFO started out as an abnormally bright light high in the sky, it disappeared then re-appeared within a few minuets but closer.  We shined a 2 mile flashlight towards the object and it disappeared again.   We stared off into the sky in curiosity and suddenly, a large oval light, yellowish orange in color, appeared above our neighbors tree (approximately 1/2 football field away) it just hovered there without noise and another oval light appeared on the right side and one more on the left side of the first initial oval light.   The objects stayed there for only a mere 1-2 minuets and then disappeared.  This object moved fast, hovered, had no sound.   The way this happened, I feel that this object wanted our specific attention. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));39.9932;-89.6664
