A grey disk/saucer hovering over a empty field at midnight.;2013-01-22 00:00:00;5 minutes;A grey disk/saucer hovering over a empty field at midnight. I was with my buddy staring out his window when we saw a round disk like object hovering over his field.  There were no lights on inside or outside it was pitch black at midnight.  There was only one disk/saucer there were red green and yellow flashing lights.  It stayed there for a good three minutes and then flew off very fast.  It came back and did the same thing for another two minutes and it was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));39.9932;-89.6664
