Fast, flickering, ball of red and white lights seen in the northern sky traveling I57 near Peotone, Illinois;2004-11-13 21:55:00;10 minutes;Fast, flickering, ball of red and white lights seen in the northern sky traveling I57 near Peotone, Illinois I was driving north on I57 from Kankakee to Frankfort, my eyes were on the skies, as it was a clear, dark night with many stars visible.  I witnessed the red lights on 10/31/04 from Frankfort, Illinois, and since then, I have been watching the skies at night whenever it was possible.  I saw a ball shaped object in the Northeast sky that was flickering between red and white lights, it was a super fast flicker, and it rotated where the flickering came from on the object.  It would flicker in one spot, and then a second later in another spot, but on the same object, traveling at the same speed.  I don't know how else to describe it.  I called my husband (in Frankfort), and asked him to look, he was unable to see it.  I watched it travel east until I couldn't see it anymore, (only because I was driving, and literally couldn't view it anymore, but I don't know if it disappeared).  Minutes later, while still on my phone with my husband, it came into view again, this time traveling from the east to the west.  It was the exact same object, traveling at the same speed.  Again, I lost view of it in the western sky only because I was driving, and couldn't watch it and drive safely.  I know it seems weird that I have observed something again, but obviously something is going on, and it has peaked my interest to observe and watch the skies whenever I can.;41.3371;-87.7997
Bright light got dimmer, emitted another light, both faded out.;2008-06-14 22:40:00;1.5 minutes;Bright light got dimmer, emitted another light, both faded out. I live close to Chicago and was outside having a cigarette. There is a lot of air traffic around here so I'm used to seeing a lot of planes in the air.  I look straight up and I see a bright light, brighter than any plane I've ever seen.  The bright light dims and I see what almost looks like a moving star, which means it must've been pretty high up there.  This light is moving north and starts to get really dim, then I see another light come out of this one at a 45 degree angle, at this point both lights seemed to fade out from my view.;41.3371;-87.7997
Green light followed by white trail in Illinois.;2009-09-01 20:05:00;5 Seconds;Green light followed by white trail in Illinois. At dusk, a fast moving object descended at an approximately 45 degree angle to the horizon.  The object was followed by a white trail, but most notably the main “ball” was a distinct green color.  I had seen this accompanied by my fiancé,  which we both believed to be a meteorite, although I have never seen such a low flying meteorite to compare.;41.3371;-87.7997
