Bright green pinpoint light moving very fast in the sky.  ((Spacelink satellites??));2019-12-25 20:45:00;3 seconds;Bright green pinpoint light moving very fast in the sky I was walking our dog at approximately 9:45 PM due North on the sidewalk in front of our neighbors house.  It was mostly dark and clear, but I could see clouds covering part of the sky.  While looking up at the sky for stars I saw a green dot pass over from my right shoulder which caught my attention and I focused on it.  The pinpoint emerald bright dot moved from over the neighbors garage over our open park heading North Northwest in a perfectly straight path. It moved much faster than any airplane and dissipated before the extent of my view.  It looked like a green meteor burning up in the atmosphere, but was below the clouds and was bright emerald green.  I could not tell if it was just over the trees, or just below the clouds.  No sound could be heard on a very quiet night.  No other object were seen in the vicinity. Lasted 3 seconds and no time to take a photo.  Our dog did not react.;42.3598763157894;-87.8655815789474
