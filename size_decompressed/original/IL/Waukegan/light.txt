Pulsating, white, fuzzy light seen over Illinois;2006-09-18 21:30:00;1 minute;Pulsating, white, fuzzy light seen over Illinois Stepped outside onto balcony at 9:39 PM cst. facing West/NorthWest. Observed a jet flying over and then noticed a light pulsate out in space. The light lit up then dimmed. The light was white and fuzzy. I watched it pulsate twice in a 10 second period.  I called for my daughter to come have a look and she witnessed it too. It blinked AND was moving to the south. It was not a plane or jet. Maybe the space station was passing over and the sun reflected off it, i don't know...gonna check space station position at that time.  We watched it in the western sky but looking almost straight up (80 degrees from the horizon)...we observed a white, fuzzy, pulsating light that only pulsated every 10 seconds and it was moving to the south. It WAS NOT a plane or jet, that's for sure. Had an eerie feeling about it.;42.3598763157894;-87.8655815789474
