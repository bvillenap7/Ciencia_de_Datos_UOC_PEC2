APPEARANCE OF METAL FURTHER  AWAY,  UP CLOSE A WHITE RING OF LIGHT, ROTATING IN THE MIDDLE  REFLECTING LIGHT LOCATION MY BACK YARD WATCHING THE SKYLINE TRAFFIC OF AIRPLANES, GOING NORTHBOUND NEAR THE EASTERN LAKE SHORE.  I LIVE LESS THAN 10 MINUTES AWAY FROM LAKE MICHIGAN.   TWENTY MINTUES WATCHING PLANE AFTER PLANE, I HEADED INSIDE APPROXIMATELY 04:36 PM. THE LAST PLANE WAS A BIG ONE.   A METAL BALL CAUGHT MY EYE NEAR THE BIG PLANE, WHICH I FIRST THOUGHT WAS A SMALL PLANE THAT SEEMS TO BE TOO CLOSE TO THE PLANE. NOW TOTALLY FOCUSED ON THIS SUSPENDED ROTATING SPHERE.  I DIDN'T WANT TO STOP FOCUSING ON IT, WHICH WAS A MINUTE OR MORE BY THEN.   GOT MY BINOCULARS, UP CLOSE IT WAS A RING OF WHITE LIGHT AND THE CENTER ROTATED.  CATCHING THE SUN WHICH REFLECTED A WHITE LIGHT AND EACH TIME IT TURNED TOWARDS THE SUN. NOTICING IT WAS FADING OUT OF SIGHT, VERY SLOWLY. NOT IN ANY OTHER DIRECTION, BUT BACK.   NOT UP OR DOWN, NOR SIDE TO SIDE.  I WAVED MY ARMS AND POINTED TO IT,  AS TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I SEE IT.  THIS WOULD BE MY THIRD ENCOUNTER OF SEEING A UFO.  TWO OTHER TIMES WERE HERE, IN! THE SAME CITY AT MY PARENTS BACK YARD, MID 90'S. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));42.3598763157894;-87.8655815789474
