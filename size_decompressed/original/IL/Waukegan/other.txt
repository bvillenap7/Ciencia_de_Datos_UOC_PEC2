Black Helicopter at local airport;2010-03-24 10:00:00;30 min;Black Helicopter at local airport Black helicopter was spotted flying low around at 10AM as I was washing my car.  Curiosity got the better of me, and since there was a local airport I went to check it out.  Unmarked flat-black Bell 206 (or OH-58 Kiowa?  It had no discernable pods or hardpoints though.) with tinted windows, was seen refueling at KUGN in DB Aviation aircraft lot at 10:15 AM.  I didn't see anyone around to inquire further (there was one guy on a bike, but he hustled out of there), but apparently black helicopters are the real deal.  I felt this might be worth reporting since there are many stories that associate these aircraft with other UFO phenomena.;42.3598763157894;-87.8655815789474

Mom and 8 yr old daughter see a lighted star shaped object with trailing flames above tree in back yard.;2013-01-14 18:00:00;1.5 minutes;Mom and 8yr old daughter see a lighted star shaped object with trailing flames above tree in back yard. I am a 40 year old married female I am a breast cancer survivor and am currently on medical leave from my company I live with my husband and three daughters on 2 acres of land that borders a forest preserve in Waukegan IL. we are very close to Lake Michigan.  On January 14th around 6pm my 8 year old daughter let our 9 month old male dog (Australian Healer) outside via our sliding glass doors that face the backyard, and woods. I was standing behind my daughter, the sliding door was open about a foot, we were standing just barely inside the open door, waiting for the dog to finish.  My daughter shouted in excitement,&quotlook mom, a shooting star&quot.  I changed my gaze from the dog to her direction and saw a star shaped lighted object it was traveling East to west and had a flaming trail coming from it the object hovered for a few seconds just above our cotton wood tree and then continued in a downward pattern, heading east. It was hard to tell how big the! entire object was because it was very dark. It is odd that our dog never barked at it, or tried to chase it a cattle dog chases everything.  My daughter did get a longer look then I did and has been drawing pictures of it. In addition there were some odd occurrences at our home around 2am that same day. Loud noises outside, the security lights going off, rattling and banging noises on my 20 year old daughter's window well cover, the dog growling and barking at the back sliding doors at nothing and then he would run to the front and bark. We did not see anything strange outside and I have no idea if there is even a need to talk about the incident. In conclusion, my family nor myself have never previously witnessed a UFO sighting and I can honestly say, I have thought off all the possibilities and can  not come up with a answer to what my daughter and I saw on January 14 2013. I did report the incident to the Waukegan Police department for non emergencies.;42.3598763157894;-87.8655815789474
