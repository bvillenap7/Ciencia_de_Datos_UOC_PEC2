3 lines become 1 ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  PD));2005-01-15 06:55:00;?;3 lines become 1 I was on my way to school when I saw above the sunrise three lines in a triangular pattern. They appeared to be illuminated by the rising sun, as they were the same color as the clouds around them. My glance drifted away for a while, but then I looked back out of curiosity. The lines had seemed to had joined into one bright line in the eastern sky. I watched the line for as long as I could. It stayed level, then leaned slightly. At this point, I arrived at school and had to stop watching. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Student report. PD));40.6161000000001;-89.4634999999999
