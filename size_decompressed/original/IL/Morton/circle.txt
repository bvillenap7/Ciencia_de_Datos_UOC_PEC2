Ball of white light seen while driving on interstate near morton driving into peoria.;2017-02-13 23:00:00;30 seconds;Ball of white light seen while driving on interstate near morton driving into peoria. My boyfriend and I were driving to his house from Bloomington, IL.  What made the light stick out to us was that there were little to no visible stars.  As we were talking, I guess we both noticed that this ball of light, visible in the corner of your eye if youre looking through your front windshield, it got bright enough to finally get our attention.  I pointed it out to him asking what it was because there were no stars, about 15 seconds later we watch this ball of white light abruptly dip down almost in a curving motion and completely disappear. We could not find it again.  I heard from friends that a couple other people from that town also saw but I personally did not confirm with them.;40.6161000000001;-89.4634999999999
