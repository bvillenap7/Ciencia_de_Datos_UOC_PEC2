Silent tube-like crafts-objects like nothing I have ever seen anywhere!;2013-10-14 18:00:00;4 minutes;Silent tube-like crafts-objects like nothing I have ever seen anywhere! October 14, 2013 6:00 P.M.  I saw two long cylindrical objects fly over my house in Vernon Hills IL.  They flew about 30 seconds to a minute apart in a southerly direction. The objects looked like a Learjet type body with rounded-oval noses front and rear of the object. It was white, had no tail, no wings, no lights, no windows, no markings,no light reflection, and COMPLETELY SILENT!   It had like a small square mast in the middle of the object and had some red at the top of it. This is the best description I can give of what my neighbor and both saw.;42.2284;-87.9722000000001
