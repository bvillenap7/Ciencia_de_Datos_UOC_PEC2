Unusual Red Triangular Light Formation;2013-04-20 21:25:00;30-60 seconds;Unusual Red Triangular Light Formation I was exiting a store with my boyfriend between 9:25 PM and 9:30 PM,  I noticed about 5-6 red lights in a triangle formation to the North of us more than 5 miles away from where we stood at the store entrance. I pointed this out to my boyfriend and he thought this was unusual and said it looked like a Christmas tree shape.  I did not notice if they were moving in any certain direction as the objects were at a far distance. My boyfriend thought the objects seemed to be in one place, almost like a constellation. At this point I attempted to take a picture with my cellphone, but was unable due to the far distance of the objects and the bright parking lot lights.  While I tried to take the picture I noticed a white flash, at first I thought it may have been lightning and even asked my boyfriend if it was supposed to rain, as we have had storms the past few days, but none today. We observed that the red lights were gone after the flash, and were unable to relocate them anywhere. We live close enough to Oâ€™Hare airport, and are familiar with the lights that planes have. These lights did not look in any way, shape, or form like plane lights.;42.2284;-87.9722000000001
