Green ball of light blasts forward and disappears in Vernon Hills, Illinois.;2020-09-21 21:05:00;1 second;Green ball of light blasts forward and disappears in Vernon Hills, Illinois. I saw one green ball of light that zoomed off in a forward direction away from me and instantly disappeared all in about a seconds time.  The object seemed to be much closer to the ground than a meteor, I would guess that it was about as close to the ground as a helicopter usually is.  The object did not appear to be very large, even though I was far away and am not certain, I would guess that it could not have been bigger than a helicopter.  The object also had no smoke or dust trail.  The color of the object was a bright green, slightly darker than lime-green. I was the only observer of the object.  I am 20, live in Vernon Hills, and I am a full time college student at Depaul University in Chicago.;42.2284;-87.9722000000001
