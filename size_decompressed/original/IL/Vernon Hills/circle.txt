Mysterious light dashes accross the sky;2001-07-09 22:45:00;3 minutes;Mysterious light dashes accross the sky Was walking my dog, looked up at the clear sky-saw a flash of light, like a plane.  It was just for an instance, then went away.  I kept looking, then it flashed again much further accross the sky.  It did this 4 to 5 times going much further each time it flashed.  There is no way a plane could have traveled that far that quickly.  It was only a flash of light.  Was not able to see a shape. It was a redish/white light.;42.2284;-87.9722000000001
