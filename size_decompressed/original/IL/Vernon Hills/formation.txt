pinpoint lights in V formation seen in the night sky;2015-03-27 22:35:00;30 seconds;pinpoint lights in V formation seen in the night sky My daughter and I were out on our balcony looking for the Andromeda galaxy.  When we suddenly noticed what looked like a lone wisp of smoke traveling across the clear, night sky.   As we focused on this movement, we both realized that it was multiple pin-point lights that traveled in a V formation, with an occasional slight wave-like movement in this formation, like a flock of birds.   We followed it until it went out of our vision over the roof.  We went to the front of the house to continue looking and it disappeared.;42.2284;-87.9722000000001
