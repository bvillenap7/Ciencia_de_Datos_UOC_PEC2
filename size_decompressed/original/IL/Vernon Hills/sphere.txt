Flickering flame in clear ball follows our car;2012-07-28 21:30:00;30 seconds;Flickering flame in clear ball follows our car My husband and I saw a clear ball (looked like a crystal ball) with a flickering flame inside as we were driving down the street.  It flew about 20 feet in the air.  It zoomed across the street and maintained its position over our car.  It followed our path as we turned a corner.  It followed us for about 30 seconds, and then it zoomed back in the direction we came from.  It definitely had control over its flight path and speed.
