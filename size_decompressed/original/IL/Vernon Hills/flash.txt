STREAK OF FIRE IN AFTERNOON SKY.;2002-05-09 16:15:00;3 SECONDS;STREAK OF FIRE IN AFTERNOON SKY. I WAS DRIVING SOUTH ON ILLINOIS 21 (MILWAUKEE AVE.) JUST SOUTH OF ILLINOIS 60. DRIVING ALONG, I SUDDENLY NOTICED WHAT I FIRST THOUGHT WAS A FLAIR IN THE SKY DIRECTLY OVER A RETIREMENT HOME ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY. IN AN INSTANT, I REALIZED THIS WAS NOT A FLAIR.  IT WAS A STREAK OF FIRE IN THE SKY MOVING STRAIGHT DOWN, AT ABOUT THE SAME SPEED THAT A FLAIR MOVES.  AFTER A SECOND OR TWO, THE STREAK ENDED, AND THERE WAS A SUDDEN SMALL FIRE-LIKE FLASH AT THE SPOT THAT THE STREAK ENDED. THAT IS ALL THERE WAS TO IT.  I HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT IS COULD HAVE BEEN SPACE JUNK RETURNING TO EARTH, OR PERHAPS A METEORITE. MY QUESTION IS DID ANYONE ELSE WITNESS THIS INCIDENT, OR TRACK IT ON RADAR?;42.2284;-87.9722000000001
