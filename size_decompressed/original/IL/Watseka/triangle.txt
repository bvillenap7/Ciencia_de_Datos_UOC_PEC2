Triangular-shaped object seen near Watseka, IL;2001-12-19 23:30:00;15 minutes;Triangular-shaped object seen near Watseka, IL On 12/19/01 at approximately 11:30pm a man and his wife claim to have witnessed an unusual object near the town of Watseka, IL. The couple was driving toward Cresecent City from Manteno, IL. They looked out the window in a northerly direction and reportedly observed a large, dark triangular-shaped object in the sky halfway up from the horizon. The object they described was estimated to be 100 feet in length and had three circles of whitish-orange light (one positioned at each corner of the triangle). As they observed the object, it slowly moved from the north to the southwest. It did not appear to change altitude during the sighting. While it was in the general vicinity, the radio in their vehicle had interference. The witnesses stated they observed the object for approximately 15 minutes and supposedly were able to videotape the object during this time. However, after repeated requests by the case investigator to view the tape, the witness has failed to produce it. In addition, the credibility of the witnesses was judged to be low based on other factors. (Case investigated and submitted by Illinois MUFON State Section Director, Vic Connor).
