The orb stopped for a few seconds the started heading south at a high rate of speed.  Than dissapeared in seconds.   A few seconds later another one appeared in a different part of the sky and did the same thing.  This all happend right after the fireworks display.  Both orbs seem to approach in the direction of the fireworks.  None of the orbs made any sound.;42.3968;-88.1682
Slow moving strange red lights over Pistakee Lake.;2012-07-11 22:00:00;2 minutes;Slow moving strange red lights over Pistakee Lake. My husband and I were sitting in our screened-in porch facing Pistakee Lake when all of a sudden these red lights were moving slowly in front of the house about 20 or 30 ft high.  At first, I thought it was a firework that didn't explode or something and expected it to just fade out, but it didn't. It kept moving so I asked my husband, What is that? and then we grabbed the bincolulars and went outside for a closer look.  I heard someone down the lake say, Could that be a plane? so I knew other people saw it too.   There was no moon and lots of clouds so we really couldn't make out the shape...just lots of red lights close together.  It made absolutely NO noise, and after about a minute, it turned and slowly started rising over the lake and then started moving much faster and then just faded away.;42.3968;-88.1682
