Static in the sky. Became smaller in shape the dissapeared. I was walking with a friend and I glanced up into the sky. I saw a hazy red oval shape in the sky. At first I dismissed it for the moon behind clouds but then I saw that it was a clear night and that it didn't look quite right.  I asked my friend who dismissed the possiblity of an aeroplane or a helicopter because it was so static in the sky. Also there appeared to be a blurred flashing light in the bottom left hand corner of the object that lept accross the base to the other side ever few seconds.  After around 2 or 3 minutes of bafflement the object all of a sudden began to shrink in size until it was mearly a third of the size of it's origional shape and almost circular. Whether that's because of it moving position in the sky and it's shape percieved to change as it moved i don't know. It was too far away to tell.  After it stopped shrinking it stopped for a few seconds and then calmly dissapeared into the night sky at a 45 degree angle.  I was never a firm believer in U.F.O sightings but I saw this with my own eyes along with a witness and I'm am at odds with myself to determine what it was.;42.3968;-88.1682
