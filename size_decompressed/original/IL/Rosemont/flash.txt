flashing changing lights over chicago for an hour or more;2007-03-04 22:30:00;1 hour;flashing changing lights over chicago for an hour or more I left work about 1030 pm and saw a white light flashing south of O'hare moving west to east.  As i drove south on 294 i watched this object and eventually lost sight of it.  When i got into westmont it was visible again.  The light originally appeared white and then started pulsating red and blueish lights as if the object was spinning.  This thing appeared over chicago and turned west and came close to being over my head in a matter of seconds.  It would go one direction and then immediately change direction.  It would rise from lower than the clouds up into the clouds and circled the chicago area for an hour.  I can still see it occasionally as i am typing this.  The entire object seemed to be pulsating light, not just off of wing tips as on an airplane.  Commercial aircraft were present at the time.  They would dissapear after a few minutes, this object did not.  At some points it appeared to also be stationary.  I alerted my friend to it and he saw it.  When i got home my mom and sister also saw it. None of us have ever seen anything like this before.  There was no sound coming from this thing when it was almost over my head when i was almost home.  There is 25 miles between where i work and live and this thing was visible from both places just a easily.  We all thought someone should know about this.;42.0155;-87.8687
