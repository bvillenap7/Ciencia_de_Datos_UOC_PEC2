Orange, house-shaped craft;1981-04-01 21:00:00;1 minute;Orange, house-shaped craft My parents and I arrived home from a church function on a Wednesday evening about 9 p.m., while I was going to the house after I got out of the car, I saw in the sky a bright orange object in the shape of what I can best describe as a 'house' shaped object, illuminating very high in the sky.  It seemed to be travelling up, no other lights were seen on the object, it was only orange.  I pointed it out to my father and mother and they told me not to worry and to go inside the house.  Again, it was not close to the ground, but it was a very distinct shape, very bright, not a star or Mars as it was definitely moving in an upward motion.  I've never forgotten this, even thought I was only about 11 at the time of this sighting.  When I bring it up to my parents, they tell me they remember seeing the object, but it must have been a satellite or something like that.  Any ideas? ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
