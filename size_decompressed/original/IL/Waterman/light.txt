Craft with 3 colored lights flying over farms between Waterman and Leland.;2020-06-10 21:12:00;10 minutes;Craft with 3 colored lights flying over farms between Waterman and Leland. It is shortly after 9pm and the final glows of dusk were in the western sky. I was driving home eastbound on Route 30 all surrounded by farmland. As I began turning south onto Leland Rd I saw a flying craft with 3 lights - red, white, and green. The red and green lights were on the left and right sides, respectively. They alternate blinking at a constant rate of about a half second each. The white light was between in the middle and constant. The silhouette of the actual craft was hard to discern nehind the lights against the sky. Shortly after turning onto Leland Rd I pulled my car to the side of the road about half a mile from HO-KA Turkeys and parked. I exit my vehicle and observe the craft moving west from Leland Rd at an estimated 500 ft from the surface at a notable speed. There is virtually no noise in the area, and no sounds from the craft. At about a half mile from Leland Rd the craft turned southward and continued at a constant speed. I get in my c! ar and continue to drive south toward home, following the craft ahead of me to the right. I only begin to gain on it after speeding up to 60 mph or so. Shortly after I began getting closer to the craft it turns eastward back toward and over Leland Rd at a very fast speed. It continues in that direction until it is no longer viewable to me from my car windows. I continued toward home.;41.7504;-88.7754
