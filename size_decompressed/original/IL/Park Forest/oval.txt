I saw 3 round strange looking objects in the sky;2005-10-06 11:00:00;5 mins;I saw 3 round strange looking objects in the sky I saw 3 round objects high in the sky but not too far away.  Not as far as stars.  They were too close. They were yellowish. My wife said they were red.  They stayed there about 5 mins. So I know they weren't planes or fireworks. Well, anyway, there you go.

I selected &quotoval&quot from the drop-down I spotted, then observed the large bright light for 40 minutes before going back to bed. I selected oval from the drop-down, but its outline was more precisely shaped like the number 8, but with the top circle slightly into the bottom circle, and solid white light.   It was motionless, did not flash or change color, but did slightly dim on occasion, as if being covered shortly by clouds.  It was at least twice the size and brightness of Venus (when its at its brightest in the summer, but nowhere close to where Venus is actually located in our sky.)  It was directly east from us, located about 40 degrees from the horizon from my perspective.   There are stars in that region of sky and airplanes flying way off in the distance (toward Lake Michigan and IN), but this was not either of those or a meteor (40 minute observation) and huge in comparison.  I did get the impression it was quite a distance eastward and at a substantial high altitude, but I had! no reference point to be certain about those aspects.  I know the normal sky geography in that region well... I walk my dog every night between 9:30 and 1100 PM and look out my kitchen window in that direction often several times a night between midnight and 5:00 AM.  Whatever this was, it should not have been there, was not seen days before my sighting and nothing now several days after, extremely extraordinary and not even remotely similar to anything seen in that region of sky or anywhere else!   I have no way of knowing if it could have been from this planet or not, but I can absolutely attest to the fact that it was there, and it wasn't a natural object.  Even at that time of night I'd bet other people also saw it, as it was that obvious.;41.4782;-87.6833
Strange white moving object South Chicago Suburbs around Halloween 2020;2020-10-29 12:00:00;10 seconds;Strange white moving object South Chicago Suburbs around Halloween 2020 I was driving in a car with another passenger, around noon on the approximate date of October 29th/30th of 2020.  We were at Sauk Trail and Western Avenue where I noticed a white oval/rectangle shape moving in the sky west to east.  It had no other color to it.  The closest object I can think of that it looked like was a helicopter but it was all white which most helicopters are not.  It then moved along going lower to where it disappeared behind trees and was no longer visible.  It did not move any faster than a usual object in the sky such as a helicopter or plane but it was very unusual and of a single white color.  It was absolutely not a cloud.  It made no audible noise, no lights of any kind, no unusual speed, in fact the thing most strange about it was just that, that it was of such uniform color white/off white.  The shape was also strange as it appeared generally close but looked like a roundish oval blob.  We both saw the object and are very perple! xed by it.;41.4782;-87.6833
