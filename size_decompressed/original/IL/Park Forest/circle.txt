It was a cold but, a clear night and I looked up and saw 2 glowing orange objects with white headlights that didn’t look like airplanes.  I thought could they be helicopters?  I felt that they were flying too close together and they were not making any noise. I watched for maybe a minute and I saw more aircraft.  They were in single file formation, some were flying side by side.  I called to my granddaughter and told her to bring her phone.  I tried to count how many.  I think I counted up to 20.  They weren’t moving fast but, not too slow, but at a steady pace.  They were headed southeast towards Crete, Il. My granddaughter did manage to capture a video.  I asked a few of my neighbors, but of course they didn’t see anything.  I just can’t imagine why there were not any more witnesses because they were in full view for so long. They lit up the sky illuminating stars that I believe couldn’t be seen without their illumination.  After, they left the sky was still glowing and the stars were still shining for what seemed like a minute.;41.4782;-87.6833
