bright white flashes high in sky;2017-12-26 03:00:00;3 minutes;bright white flashes high in sky Stepped outside to have a smoke and stargaze on a cold and clear morning.  As I'm looking at the brightest stars I see a bright white flash high in the sky not far from a bright star I was looking at.  I thought maybe it was a meteor but I kept my eyes focused on the spot I saw the flash.  A few seconds later a second flash in the exact same spot.  Then another flash.  Then a slightly longer flash, and then a few seconds later and it flashed again, in the same spot in the sky but slightly dimmer and I could tell it was further away.  Then one last flash still dimmer and further away before it was, I guess, out of view?  Bright white flashes, brief with no pattern or rhythm, maybe 5 or 6 total.  Slightly brighter than any star, and the flashes were quick except for the longer flash which seemed to be a build up, dim out type of flash.;40.1968;-88.3925
