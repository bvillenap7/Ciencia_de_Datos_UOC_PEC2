a small, yellow, plain disk that hovered slowly moving down the back road.;2005-06-17 17:00:00;20-30 seconds;a small, yellow, plain disk that hovered slowly moving down the back road. I saw it in the middle of the day and it was sunny outside. I looked out the window, into my back yard, and saw something yellow moving from behind the trees above the back street. I thought it was some kind of yellow bird, so I watched it as it came into view. When it came out from behind the trees I saw that it was disk-like in shape, and from where I saw it looked about two-three feet wide. It was just plain light yellow with no special markings or lights or anything. It was hovering a little lower than the power line but not directly under it and it gradually moved up higher above the power line. It moved slowly from the left to the right of my view, lightly bobbing up and down as moved. I watched it disappear behind more trees. My dad, my grandma, and other people in my family have all claimed that they've seen UFO's. I'm pretty sure I was the only one that saw it. I was about 10 or 11 years old.
