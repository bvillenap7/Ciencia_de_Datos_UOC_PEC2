Had a huge light and was pointing it in the sky for about ten minutes when we noticed a blue sphere following the light put of by the flashlight. I would move the light in all kinds of directions and the sphere would follow it.Before all of this happend one of my freinds had noticed stars shaped in the form of trangle at least we thought.any waysafter all of this was going on with the blue sphere chasing the beam of light, we noticed the trangle shape object was coming down gettin closer and closer at this point we were all so scared we were almost froze we finally got up and ran into the house closed all of the blinds and waited about an hour to se if it was still there.;38.4209;-89.7661
