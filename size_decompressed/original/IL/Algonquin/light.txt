Single fire colored object spotted moving in a slow and nonlinear way;2009-07-04 21:46:00;approx 1.5 minutes;Single fire colored object spotted moving in a slow and nonlinear way During the normal Independence day celebrations going on in my neighborhood, my 10 year daughter and I had seen what immediately looked like a firework of some sort way in the distance. However, it became apparent after a few seconds that this was no firework even though it had the glowing color of a yellow/orange fire because it was moving way too slowly. The movement from our vantage point first moved from right to left fairly slowly which seemed like it could have been an airplane. However, after about 30 seconds of this right to left slow movement the object was still for about 10 to 15 seconds. Then the object moved very little from left to right for a short time of around 10 seconds. Immediately thereafter, the movement started going down towards the earth in a straight line. This downward movement lasted about 15 to 20 seconds as the fire type light started to fade away in intensity. After the full downward movement of 20 seconds or so the light did indeed fade into darkness. From my observation the best explanation I could come up with is the fire light might have been possibly an airplane which was engulfed in flames or perhaps an erratic moving missile which seems more unlikely. In any case, this could not have been a type of fancy firework considering how long it lasted and the nonlinear movement.;42.1643;-88.3123999999999
Fast lights in formation;2012-03-15 22:03:00;5 seconds;fast lights in formation 2 white lights....dots in form...maybe 40000 50000 feet in altitude...hard to tell....one set in front and one to 45% angle behind and to right.   Like migrating geese formation.   Very fast.   No engine or propulsion sound at all minutes afterward...did not burn up or break up like a meteor and did not change color whatsoever.   And I watch the stars a lot.   Take it how u want. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.  PD));42.1643;-88.3123999999999
5 Yellow/Orange moving lights seen in sky over Algonquin, Illinois.;2015-07-03 21:30:00;3-5 minutes (each);5 Yellow/Orange moving lights seen in sky over Algonquin, Illinois. July 3rd, 2015, approx. 9:40PM CST to 10:00PM.  Five separate orange lights appeared out of the eastern sky over Algonquin, Illinois. Though there were fireworks in the distance, this was different.  The four objects took off one at a time, soundless, they climbed out of the eastern sky to an altitude, when they moved around a little before finding a position where they remained.  The intensity of each light changed, getting brighter and then slowly dimming until extinguished.  This took 3-5 minutes each. Too much energy would be required to launch, reach altitude and power a sufficiently bright light that could be seen maybe Â½ mile away.  Were they drones?   After burn-out, there was no sign that they fell to earth. Local SWAT drones?  DARPA? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

They started to dim with the exception of one that stayed lit for a minute or so longer than the others.;42.1643;-88.3123999999999
Moving starlike light circled around area over the course of night, dimming out at dawn;2016-06-03 00:00:00;4+ hours;Moving starlike light circled around area over the course of night, dimming out at dawn My associate messaged me around 12:15 am, saying there was a UFO visible from his house so I came by around 12:25 at the latest and from then on saw the object which looked like the brightest star in the sky and was slowly making its way to the right, from our position it was moving south.  It would hover and move randomly about within a small vicinity, up, down, left, righy, etc.  But generally maintained the southern path.  I headed home, got my brother and we followed it.  It eventually around 4am settled just above the horizon west of Algonquin and dimmed as the night progressed until it dimmed out completely around 4 when dawn was beginning.;42.1643;-88.3123999999999
