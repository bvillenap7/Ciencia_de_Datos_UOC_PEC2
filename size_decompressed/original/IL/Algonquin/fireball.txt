Glowing ball seen descending into field.;2001-09-27 21:00:00;10 sec;Glowing ball seen descending into field. I came home from work around 9:00 PM. As i was pullinginto the driveway I noticed a glowing ball falling toward the ground about 100 ft in the distance. That area happens to be an open field set aside as a future transportation corridor. I watched as the object slowly descended into the field and out of sight. I exited the car and heard a dog start barking off in the distance in that area. The color was a yellowish-green as I recall. It was not a roman candle or other fireworks display as best I could tell. There was no one else present as far as I could tell.;42.1643;-88.3123999999999
