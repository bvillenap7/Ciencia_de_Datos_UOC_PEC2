On July 31, 2011, my husband and 2 friends had returned from viewing fireworks at the Algonquin Founders Day.   We were sitting on the deck when we saw a bright orange ball, very high up, come over the house heading NE.  It moved in a straight line across the sky, and was going to slow to be a meteor.  It was much higher altitude than airplanes in the area.  We watched it approximately 25 seconds before it dimmed for a second, then disappeared.   About 20 minutes later, a second ball came from the same direction and flew in approximately the same flight path, dimming and disappearing in the same area as the first.  This AM I checked to see other reports. would love to know what this was...never seen anything like this, and I work for an airline.;42.1643;-88.3123999999999
