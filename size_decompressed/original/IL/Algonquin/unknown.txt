No planes could do this My wife looked out our first floor  room and noticed 3 lights in a row, not moving in the sky.  She ask me to look.  Since we are in the patch of Ohare airport and another small airport, we know the patterns that air traffic uses to fly over our area.  Has not changed on ten years we lived here.   These were to close to one another for normal air traffic. It also was a clear night and moon was about 1/4. We proceded outside to get a better look and the three lights (slightly red and not blinking, more like a glow) were not moving for about five minutes. The ine on the right then went directly to our right and after a few seconds dissapeared.  Several seconds later the one on the left , went left and also dissappeared. After about 30 seconds the final one. went straight up and light got smaller and smaller until it was gone. We both looked at each other in amazement. Never have seen any air traffic ever do this in our lives.  NO SOUNDS what so ever.  If they were planes that close we could have heard them. I shot several pictures with my 10pm camera. Nothing appears to show up.  But if studied closer maybe something can be seen.;42.1643;-88.3123999999999
