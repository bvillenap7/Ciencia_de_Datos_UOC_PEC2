While shooting fireworks, saw a bright blue object move horizontilly from east to west across the field in the back of the house.;1997-07-04 21:45:00;10 seconds;Summary : While shooting fireworks, saw a bright blue object move horizontilly from east to west across the field in the back of the house. As we were shooting fireworks at 9:45pm on  july 4th, we saw a electric blue object with a bright white core move horizontally from east to west.  The light came from over the trees to the east and moved  to the southwest diaginally to the west.  At first we thought it was a shooting star, but later we learned there were reports of similar objects seen in the area.  The object was about the size of a soccer ball and was electric blue around the core. It looked to be about 100' above the gound and was visible for about 600 or 700 ft. and then suddenly disappeared.. The total time visable to us was 5 to 7 seconds.  There was no noise associated with the sighting..  There was only one object observed.  The observers are between 47 and 54 years old and business owners.  We have never seen anything like this.  We are not under medication  or have not been treated for mental illness and both witnessed the same thing..;39.0343;-90.1372
Orange Orbs Ascend From the Northwest.;2012-03-24 19:40:00;10 minutes;Orange Orbs Ascend From the Northwest. Coming from the North/Northwest, several orange glowing orbs ascended.  First five to six were not in a pattern.  Then three, then one, then two more followed one after another.  I watched at least eight to ten of these reach the heavy clouds dark from the sun setting, the objects being higher than the clouds.  Objects followed no trajectory yet most followed in the same pattern.  When two were seen one appeared to stray from the other moving westward.  All objects completely ascended until out of sight.  I recorded two of these orange objects.;39.0343;-90.1372
