I was very interested in the recent sighting in Sidney Texas! I thought maybe I was seeing things years ago and would have believed just that if the kids standing there with me had'nt started howling at the sight.   It the craft was just as the man in Sidney had said.  It was in a triangle shape and moved very slow seemed to be black or very dark in color it flew over us stopped hovered above us for some time as if to be watching us. It didnt really scare me I had a feeling it was ok, like perhaps checking observation equipment or something.  It however was unusally quiet, and was flying at an unbelievable height, I couldn't believe it was so close to us and moving so slowly, it arrived with no sound hardly at all and left with no sound above a slight humming. As it left the lights seemed to appear to come on as if on some type of dimmer switch but as it left I felt a very slight breeze thats just how low it was.  That year I went to the VP Fair to see the Harrier to see for myself if it moved in the same manner, the manuvers were the same but the sound and shape were not,  I've often wondered if it was of our own and felt as tho it was now I believe just that after the 2005 sighting in Sidney Texas,it was good to hear he could read the words on it, thanks for the reporting!;39.0343;-90.1372
