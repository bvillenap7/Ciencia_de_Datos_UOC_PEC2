I was about 12 yrs. old.  My friends and I were playing on Ashland Ave. in Evanston, when we all noticed an orange disk hovering to the northwest.  At arms length it would have been about the size of a football, and it seemed to be only a few blocks away, perhaps over a large park from the look of it.  It simply hovered there for a long time.  Eventually, all of the children became afraid and everyone ran to there homes.  I'm fuzzy on dates, but I remember it was late afternoon/early evening. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
