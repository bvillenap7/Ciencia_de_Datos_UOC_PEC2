I looked up and saw a streak of light and then it slowed down.

I couldn't tell exactly how far away it was...but it didn't seem too far. It was traveling very slow like it was looking for something. I noticed that there were lights all around the side of the ship. It was kind of like a triangle with a broad side in the front going to a point in the back. The two front tips seemed to have two brighter lights then the rest. It moved real slow for about 15-20 seconds, and then streaked off to the North. It was so vivid in my memory that there is no way I just imagined it.;42.0483024793388;-87.692638016529
4 circleing lights went around in 1 rotation then it went back in to 1 big circle. Then it broke off again in to 4 little ones.;2002-06-02 22:30:00;In the sky;4 circleing lights went around in 1 rotation then it went back in to 1 big circle. Then it broke off again in to 4 little ones. I saw 4 bright cirlces in the sky moving around. Well the 4 cirlces broke off and then all joined back as 1. It has been doing that for some time. Did I see a UFO??? If I did or can u tell me what I saw? The same thing happend again and again. The 4 lights went around once and then came back as a hole then broke off again. It kept doing that for a long time. What did I see? Please I would love to know what I saw? Write me back As Soon As Possible.
