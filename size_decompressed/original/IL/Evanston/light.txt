Red laser light beam in Evanston, Illinois;2005-12-29 03:30:00;a few seconds;Red laser light beam in Evanston, Illinois Single red laser light beam came through slats of shuttered window on our second floor window faces south. The light was coming from a higher point, seemed like 45 degrees or more from horizontal. Based on the angle, it didn't seem like it could possibly be coming from a neighbor's house. Too freaked out to look outside afterwards. There was no sound.;42.0483024793388;-87.692638016529
Orange light, non-blinking, appearing to follow passenger jet;2012-06-29 20:00:00;3 minutes;Orange light, non-blinking, appearing to follow passenger jet An orange light appeared to be following an airplane at a considerable distance and at a similar altitude. Both were traveling towards the south-west. The light appeared to be traveling at a slower pace than the airplane. After watching the orange light for a couple minutes, it began to turn at a gradual pace towards the south-east. There was no sound coming from the light and its luminescence remained constant. The craft had completely disappeared from sight after the viewer turned their attention away for a second.;42.0483024793388;-87.692638016529
