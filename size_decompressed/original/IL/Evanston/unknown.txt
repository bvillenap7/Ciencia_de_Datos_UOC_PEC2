A hovering object was seen by me and my friend.  It was flashing and had some sort of odd (greenish) colored spotlight shining down on the water.   My friend and I stood and watched it hover for about 5 minutes until the spotlight changed colors and then turned off.   We thought it was a helicopter at first but it made no sound (which was weird) and took off to full speed faster than any helicopter or jet or anything could.   When it took off, it just went straight up really fast and then changed directions to go speeding off southwest over Chicago and slightly up.   NOTHING that we are supposed to know about travels like that.    We didn't really tell anybody about it but after the incident at O'Hare just recently I'm starting to believe that SOMETHING is going on.;42.0483024793388;-87.692638016529
