One object floated for approx. 5 mins before I told someone else to pay attention.  We looked across the entire sky to make sure it wasn't any type of reflection from somewhere else.  The circular object continued to float for approx. 10 more mins before it started to drift away.  It did not move side to side or round and round.  It moved straight back with no other motion, as if it were traveling in a line.  The white lights were very bright and did not flash or blink and was much larger than an aircraft.  There seemed to be no sound coming from the object, but distance could have played a large part in that.  The object was watched over a schools baseball field so there were no interruptions or anything to block the view.  It was a clear night and besides this floating object only airplanes and stars and the moon were in the sky.;42.0483024793388;-87.692638016529
