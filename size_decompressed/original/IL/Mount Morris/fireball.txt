4 orange glowing objects sighted flying in single formation.;2015-08-03 21:50:00;5 minutes;4 orange glowing objects sighted flying in single formation. On August 3rd, 2015, at 9:50 PM Central time), I witnessed, along with my wife, what can only be described as 4 to possibly 5 UFOâ€™s flying in a extended single line form formation. My first observation happened when I stepped out onto my deck, facing directly South.  The sky was clear, and many stars were visible, along with a couple high altitude aircraft heading westward. I then began to see what at first I thought was a aircraft at a lower altitude, coming from the SW into view and was orange glowing which I thought was its landing lights.  We have a small grassy airstrip nearby. After it got closer, I was thinking it should be making some sort of noise which it was not.  It see to have a similar speed to a helicopter then a airplane.  As the first object moved East and appeared to change course towards the SE I saw another object of the same type come from the same general place the first object did. At this point I ran down to the bedroom and told my wife to look out her window, which she did, and witnessed what I was seeing. We ended up seeing at least 4 objects move at equal spacing across the southern sky, at about 30 degree from my point of observation. Then they all proceeded to fly the same path east, then southeast, and gained altitude and faded one by one. I most definitely cannot come to any other conclusion then what I and my wife witnessed was some sort of UFO that could not be identified as naturally occurring, or a physically identifiable, aircraft.
