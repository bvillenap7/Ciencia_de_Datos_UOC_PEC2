Triangle of light in sky over Lake County, IL.;2011-05-22 19:00:00;00:01;Triangle of light in sky over Lake County, IL. I observed several bright yellow lights (7 or 8) in the form of a triangle.  The lights were too bright to be stars and if it was one object too big to be a plane.   The triangle of lights traveled at a high rate of speed well above where I was standing.   In less than a minute they had passed beyond my sight in a northerly direction. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
