Red/Blue lights moving around object with bright white light in tight formation;2007-10-09 00:00:00;2 hrs 30 min;Red/Blue lights moving around object with bright white light in tight formation Venus was out this summer so I got use to looking in the north eastern sky from my second story window. On the night of Oct 9th, roughly at midnight, I looked out my window to see a surprisingly clear night. There was one star that appeared brighter and somewhat vibrating. I grabbed my binoculars and found the object. The reason it seemed as though it was vibrating was because a red and blue light were tightly moving around another object with a bright white light on it. This is when I went outside. I went into my backyard and easily found the object again. I watched it for about 25 minutes. It just hung there in the same spot while the lights moved around. I was too far away to make any sound out, as it appeared to be hovering over Northern Waukegan. Trying to photograph it with my camera phone would have been pointless, so I didn't bother. Occasionally the lights seemed to blend together and the red and blue lights would disappear. Then it would start up again. I got distracted at about 12:30 by a friend. I periodically checked the spot in the sky until about 3am, when it was finally no longer there. I have looked out to the same spot pretty much every night since just to make sure I wasn't seeing something that should be there and the object has not returned.;42.2823;-87.8601
