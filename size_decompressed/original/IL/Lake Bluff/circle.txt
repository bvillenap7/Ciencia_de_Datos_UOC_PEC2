Driving down Route 41 about to get off at the route 176 exit and Both the driver and I immediately were drawn to these two bright yellow balls of lights that hovered next to each other, twisted around each other and one took off South East and the other North West.   We lost sight of each of them as a tree blocked our view for not even 3 seconds and we could not find either object in the sky.  If these were planes they would have still been In our range.   They were two bright yellow balls that danced together and then took off so quickly.  They only danced for about 10 seconds.;42.2823;-87.8601
