Dark object moving papidly to the east;2007-10-20 02:30:00;10 seconds;Dark object moving rapidly to the east I was at work taking a break at about 2:30 AM CST, im kind of a astronomy junkie so I was looking at the stars, when I saw some movement out of the corner of my eye. I could barley make it out at first, but as it got more over head I could see that it was a boomerang shaped object, moving very fast, made no noise and there were no visable lights. I watched this object as it headed towards the east until I lost sight of it, the whole thing lasted about 10-15 seconds. afterwords I tried to figure out what I had just seen and couldnt come up with anything other than a UFO.;40.7313893939395;-89.6195935606062
