We have both been ufo fanatics for a while now and still have not seen one until tonight!!!  We have video and everything of it! On YouTube. Anyway...  We followed it with my phone while in the car and after looking at the video we took, it showed another one appeared right next to the first one and went in these crazy fast diagonal directions and then disappeared into the sky.
