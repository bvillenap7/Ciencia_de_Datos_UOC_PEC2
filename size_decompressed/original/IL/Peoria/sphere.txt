Red Orange spheres seen in Peoria Il;2012-11-17 23:00:00;5 minutes;Red Orange spheres seen in Peoria Il My husband and I were out to take our dog for her last potty break of the night at 11:00 pm when he pointed out a strange arrangement of lights north of us.  The lights were red and orange in color and brighter than any star in the sky.  The sky was clear and the stars were visible and the lights I saw were not stars or Chinese lanterns.  The lights were arranged forming a round x, five for each curved line, then more lights, four that I was able to spot.  I probably missed a few because I was trying to record it with a cell phone camera that did not capture a thing.  The four lights seemed to launch from below and join the moving x, then all the lights that were forming the curved x disappeared. After that, only three were left that just moved upward north and vanished into the sky.  This beautiful occurrence lasted only 5 min.;40.7313893939395;-89.6195935606062

It was lower to the ground than any stars but higher than planes would be.  The object did not move and kept flashing very bright for a duration of about 20 minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  Twinkling star?
