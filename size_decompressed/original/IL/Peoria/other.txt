Long pencil-shaped metallic color object, travelling at about the speed of a helicopter.;1999-08-14 12:00:00;1 minute;Long pencil-shaped metallic color object, travelling at about the speed of a helicopter. The entire sighting lasted for less than a minute.  I saw the object in the afternoon sky, at cloud level.  It travelled slowly against the wind and into an oncoming cloud.  The object disappeard into the cloud and did not emerge from the other side.  I waited about 5 minutes, by which time it should have emerged from the other side of the cloud, if the same rate of travel had been maintained.;40.7313893939395;-89.6195935606062
An item moving at an incredible speed in a straight line with no sound.;2008-05-31 20:34:00;6 minutes;An item moving at an incredible speed in a straight line with no sound. The evening of May 31 was perfect. Off to the north of Peoria a large storm was passing by, far enough away to provide us a grand show  of lighting as we sat in front of the Northmoor Observatory on Leo Donovan Golf Course in North Peoria. Two of us were there in the daylight waiting for it to get dark. It was our turn to show the public around the evening sky as members of the Peoria Astronomical Society. We were watching the storm when a dark moving shape appeared in the periferal vision of my left eye. The black circle was approaching from the west. At first I thought it was a goose flying toward the pond behind the observatory. We had seen a couple take off from there a little earlier. But, as it got closer I could not see any wings. My observing partner was engrossed in watching the storm and had not noticed this object coming right at us. I called his attention to it. “Is that a balloon?” he said. My thought exactly. But, we both quickly realized this object was moving very fast, and in a straight line. “Could a balloon move in a straight line that fast?” I said. We both quickly concluded that did not seem plausible to us. We each looked at our cell phones. It was 8:40 p.m. When the object passed over us we saw a different shape. It had looked round while coming toward us. As it passed overhead we saw it looked like a capital B laying on its side. And, as it passed overhead it tilted slightly to the south showing a streak of gray, but the color was flat, not reflective. There was not any sound We looked at each other and watched the item disappear into the horizon to the east never altering its speed as far as we could tell or its direction.

Odd shaped aircraft seen over Peoria IL;2008-12-28 13:00:00;10 minutes;Odd shaped aircraft seen over Peoria IL I saw this craft in the air over downtown Peoria, IL, moving from southwest to northeast in a straight line.  It must have been a half-mile in altitude and never changed direction. It was moving very slowly, as if simply being blown by the wind and it made me think it was a balloon for a long time, albeit a very large and strangely shaped balloon.  It was shaped like a parenthesis (with the arched part up and was dark gray. I would estimate its length at 30 feet and its height 5.  I was really amazed that I could see it for so long and I even saw it through binoculars but am still uncertain as to what it was if not a UFO. Like I said earlier, an odd-shaped balloon is the only thing that comes to mind, as it seemed to be floating with the wind. It never changed its position however, as a balloon might, as it stayed steady in the air except for occasionally rocking slightly to one side. It eventually drifted over the river and out of sight.;40.7313893939395;-89.6195935606062
