Several stationary orange lights in sky west of Peoria, in a descending arc which dissappeared in twos after a short period of time.;2013-10-12 21:15:00;3 minutes;Several stationary orange lights in sky west of Peoria, in a descending arc which dissappeared in twos after a short period of time. We were traveling north on Rt. 8 just north of Farmington Road at 9:15 p.m.  We saw what at first appeared to  be orange street lights above the ridge to the west and I thought it was strange that street lights had been installed along the top of the ridge.   As the view cleared of trees we realized they were much higher in the sky than we first thought.  We lost sight of them behind the trees as we drove so we u-turned and stopped in the clearing.  Three other cars had also stopped to look.   They were  5 to 6 bright orange round lights in sky, west of Peoria, stationary in a descending arc.  They were unusually bright.  They began going out, or disappearing, in twos.  The last two went out more slowly, it seemed as if they were traveling away at a high rate of speed, we could see them growing fainter as they got further away.   We u-turned again and continued north, there was a jeep and a few people standing outside the trailer park and we stopped to ask what they thought this was.  They then pointed out that there were three more orange lights north of where we saw the original lights.   These also disappeared quickly.;40.7313893939395;-89.6195935606062
