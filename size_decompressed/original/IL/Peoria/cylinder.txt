((HOAX??))  Long, big, bright White Cylinder over my place in daylight.  ((anonymous report));2018-07-20 20:18:00;5-10 minutes;Long, Big, Bright White Cylinder over my place in daylight I had just gotten home from a movie.  It was still daylight.  I got out of my car and saw it.  Large, Bright White, glowing, long Cylinder.  It was approaching my place above.  It was as long as 6 C4 Transport planes put together.  Height of it probably two tractor trailers (the part that stores stuff in) in height put together.  It made no sound and extremely slow.  It was maybe 20 stories above the ground maybe less or maybe the length of a football field up above me.  I watched it clear in an opening in the trees and once it cleared the opening was gone.

Bright, White, Long, Huge Cylindrical Object above my place.   ((anonymous report));2018-07-20 20:18:00;5-8 minutes;Bright, White, Long, Huge Cylindrical Object above my place. I had just come home from a movie.  I literally got out of my vehicle and looked up and there it was.  I would say it was the size of 6 C4 Transport planes side by side.  It was almost dusk but still light out.  It was glowing white super bright.  It moved very slow over my place.  It was big and long, too.  Then slowly it left and was gone like disappeared.  I would say it was about 1 or 2 football fields in height above me or maybe 20 stories to 40 stories above me.  I clearly make out the color, dimensions.  No sound at all whatsoever. Unfortunately,  I didn't get the opportunity to record my phone was shut off. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
