Saw first hand object and passengers inside. The reason I remember it so vividly was our son was a small baby three weeks old.  I was up watching TV after having fed the baby and put him back down.  I got up to get a drink of water in the kitchen.  I did not turn any lights on in the rest of the house just the light from the TV set.  The drapes in the family room were closed so it was hard to see just the light from the TV screen.  I got to the kitchen sink and looked up and there it was right over our back yard.  It was just a few feet from our kitchen window over the back yard.  I was just paralyzed for a shor time and stood in awe of it.  It was pulsating light and I could see figures inside but couldn't tell what they quite liiked like.  I finally made my body move and I ran in the bedroom to get my husband up.  By the time he got going and we got back out to the kitchen it was gone but not completely.  It hovered around out about a half mile.  I watched as it dove and spun and glided so gracefully.  My husband never did see what I was pointing out to him and to this day I think he thinks I lost my mind but I know what I saw and I know how close it was to me and I know how frightened I was at the time.  Now I wish I had called the police to report it but my husband said no way he didn't want anyone to think his wife was a fruit cake, but I know what I saw and I know I watched the thing fly around for almost 15 minutes.  We are directly across from the Greater Peoria Airport and I wanted to call the tower and ask them if they saw it but I didn't do it and now I regret that decision also.  I have talked with several other people who have also had an experience that was of an out of this world kind and I want to record it so that others know they are not alone when they say they saw a U.F.O.  I did see it very clearly and I did watch it for quite some time before it finally glided out of my line of sight.  I went to bed but I did not sleep well for several weeks after that strange occurence.  I am not a nut case I can assure you t! hat this is what really happened.   I would be glad to talk with you by phone if you wish.  Thanks for letting me record this event. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));40.7313893939395;-89.6195935606062
Red, white and blue unmoving orb.;2004-02-11 20:00:00;all evening;Red, white and blue unmoving orb. It was a red, blue, and white unmoving orb over the south of town. It comes and hovers every Wed. night. It shows up around night fall and will change colors once every 2 or 3 min. No it is not a star or a plane, If it were a plane it would move after 3 HOURS!!! If it were a star it would not change colors or be visable on starless nights. ((NUFORC Note:  Report is not inconsistent with a sighting of the star, Sirius, we believe.

Friend and I saw an oval object omitting red/green light, followed it and at some point went 3+ miles within the span of seconds,.;2017-06-08 23:41:00;12-15 minutes;Friend and I saw an oval object omitting red/green light, followed it and at some point went 3+ miles within the span of seconds,. Around about 11:41 pm, my friend and I noticed a red dot while on the highway.  We decided to watch it further for a bit, thinking it was a plane but it remained stationary until we came close to a nearby lighted shopping center and saw that it flashed red and green.  Upon entering the shopping center, one of the buildings blocked our view of it, and by the time we backed up so we could see it was about 3-5 miles away within a few seconds.   We then proceeded to watch it until it disappeared miles away.;40.7313893939395;-89.6195935606062
