The witness called me over and I seen the bright multicolored light as well.  We were amazed because of the bright colors that seemed to be flashing and continued to look at what resembled a flashing colorful star.  As we observed the object we both watched it rotate and even noticed it get closer and further away.  In addition to the changing distance between us and the object, it looked as if it was darting from side to side, dipping, and elevating.  We watched this for at least an hour.  Eventually the light got further away and lower in the sky and dimmed out.  Witness 1 is a 50 year old Male who does not believe in aliens or UFOs and he brought the object to my attention immediately.  I am a 30 year old female who has not experienced such a thing but have always been interested in the unexplained.  We were in the back yard playing cards whe! n this happened.  Witness 1 was actually so perplexed that he called 911.  I couldnt get a photo.  Peoria IL  July 3rd 2020;40.7313893939395;-89.6195935606062
