Light over Peoria, IL that moves slowly, stops in mid-air, hovers, changes colors, shoots in opposite direction and disappears.;1993-10-10 22:00:00;8 seconds;Light over Peoria, IL that moves slowly, stops in mid-air, hovers, changes colors, shoots in opposite direction and disappears. Years ago I was standing in my house getting ready for bed and I looked outside at the forrest across from my house.  I noticed a circular blue light traveling slowly over the tree line. The light glowed steadily, did not blink or flash, and was larger and brighter than a light on any aircraft I have seen.   The light moved in a straight line in a southern direction quite slowly then made an abrupt stop in mid air and hovered for a second.  The blue light glowed intensely brighter and then turned bright red and shot back north in the direction from which it had come.  There was just a red streak for half a second when it shot back, and then it disappeared.   I have never seen anything move that fast, and I have never seen anything just disappear.  I would have thought something like that would have made a sound even through a window, but I heard nothing.  I told myself I must have imagined it, but I know what I saw.  I don't know what it was, but it was not similar to anything I have seen before or since. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

saw eight total lights in wide V formation for 5 seconds and then they disappeared.;2000-11-28 19:00:00;5 to 6 seconds;saw eight total lights in wide V formation for 5 seconds and then they disappeared. Two objects were seen over downtown area. Each had four bright white lights on them. First one condensed into one light and disappeared. Second one was in a wide V formation. It was very low to the ground. Too low to be an airplane. It almost looked like it was going to graze the tops of the buildings. Then it to condensed into one light and disappeared. They were against the orange glow of the city lights and were very easy to see. Normaly I would not do something like this but the wife is a skeptic of everything and when she saw this she absolutely freaked. She encouraged me to do this so I did.

glowing light in sky;2007-02-10 08:30:00;30 min.;glowing light in sky It was an odd sight that looked to be out in space rather than here on Earth.  It was a Pin shaped light with distinct sharpness.  There were no clouds in the area it appeared.  The long skinny light was positioned perpendicular to the horizon and did not touch the ground.  It appeared as a comet almost but there was no distinct fading of the light at any one point.  It was bright throughout the object and didnt have a tail.  Many calls were phoned into local tv stations and even the local museum but the only answer that was given was space junk.  Space junk wouldnt be able to create that perfect shape/light and remain in the same spot for the time period it had.  it appeared in the southeastern sky.;40.7313893939395;-89.6195935606062
Circular rotating solid light gets followed by solid red light, and at the same time a c130 takes off headed to same area.;2016-09-06 22:00:00;15 minutes;Circular rotating solid light gets followed by solid red light, and at the same time a c130 takes off headed to same area. It all statted the first night with the kinda crappy videos i got Of what appeared to be a rotating light so much so that it was a perfect circle.  Luming from orange to red. It was very far off but still big enough to tell it was rather large. It hung in the sky for almost an hour before dissapearing off intonthe sky.  The second night 9/6/16 Walking outside at work at 10pm to do trash with a manager looking up to see the same circular light hanging in the sky in the same area but definitely a lot higher up, we looked at it for awhile and went to the dumpster, while waking back we could see it on the other side of the sky hanging there miles from where it was.  It had to have moved in the blink of your eye to have been able to get from where it was.  Once we rounded the corner of our building we noticed a larger solid red light moving in the direction of the circular light.  And then a c130 flew right over top of our building kinda gliding to the right of where ! the lights were.  It struck me as weird to see the c130 fly over ive never seen them take that path before. After watching the lights get closer and kinda dissapearing further up i had gone back into work.;40.7313893939395;-89.6195935606062
