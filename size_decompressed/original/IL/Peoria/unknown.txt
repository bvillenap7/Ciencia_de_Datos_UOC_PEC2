I was driving in my car with my aunt to go pick up my kids from preschool, when I saw to the right, extremely high up in the sky was a brillant light, mind this was in mid-afternoon, it was very small though.  I pointed it out to my aunt and she said that it was a plane, and I remember telling her that it was offly bright, unless we just got a view of it where the sun was reflecting off of it or something.  But then, about 10 seconds later, it was further away and the brightness of it faded, and then it was gone.  The whole sighting of whatever this thing was was less than 20 seconds.  It could have been some sort of aircraft of ours, but I have never heard of anything, WE have invented that moves that fast it was gone without a trace before we had a chance to try to follow it across the sky with out eyes.
