Pattern of orange/red round objects seen over Peoria, IL at about 11:00 PM on 11/17/12;2012-11-17 23:00:00;5 minutes;Pattern of orange/red round objects seen over Peoria, IL at about 11:00 PM on 11/17/12 On November 17, 2012, at approximately 2300 hrs, my wife and I exited our apartment in Peoria, IL to take our dog out for a short walk.  Shortly after I stepped outside, I observed several (approximately 5 or 6) orange or red round objects in the sky to the north of our apartment.  For purposes of orientation, I can say that the objects were visible north of the intersection of Allen Rd. and Willow Knolls Rd. over that area’s car dealerships (Lexus, Toyota, Nissan).  The objects were in some sort of pattern, possibly a diamond shape.  At first I thought the pattern looked like a fireworks display of some sort, but I heard no explosions.  In fact, I did not hear any noise at all coming from the area.  I pointed the objects out to my wife and she began trying to take photos and video with my cellular phone.  Unfortunately, upon review of the video, the objects were not visible.  We also saw a male exit a vehicle up the road (unknown how many passengers we! re in the car) from our apartment to look at the objects, but we did not speak to each other. As we continued to observe the objects in the sky, we noticed that some of the objects would suddenly fade away.  However, we also saw new orange/red round objects rising up from the ground in the same area north of our apartment.  While they were ascending, I noticed that the objects hovered in a manner that was somewhat similar to helicopters. But, I have never seen helicopters move quite like this and I can’t imagine why helicopters would be forming patterns in the sky at night.  The rising objects then joined the other objects before they also vanished.  By about 2305 hrs, all of the objects were gone.;40.7313893939395;-89.6195935606062
