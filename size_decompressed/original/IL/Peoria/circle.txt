Orange orb over peoria il;2012-08-12 00:00:00;40 seconds;Orange orb over peoria il While we were watching the meteor shower last Sat night/Sun morning (8/11, 8/12), we saw some strange orange glowing orbs that lingered in the sky for nearly a minute.  I know there were a lot of people out watching the falling stars that night, so someone else had to have seen it.  Google searches turn up nothing.  Wondering where would be some good resources to find out more about this, or some other eyewitness accounts. We've already checked ufosnw.com and ufostalker.com. Appreciate any help you can give.;40.7313893939395;-89.6195935606062
