Could not get your reporting format to accept this time.  Was looking at the ground and noticed a strobe flash to the west directed toward the ground.  Look up nothing there.  Thought maybe a falling star?  Several seconds later another strobe flash of white light only stronger directed toward the ground. Caught both of these flashes in my peripheral vision.  Looked at this area of the sky for several seconds and a dim glowing ball of light appeared slightly larger and rounder than a star, traveled south in a straight line for a very short time (5 seconds)and disappeared.  Objects speed was very slow.;39.314;-88.8734
