At first I believed it to be a light fixture of some kind until I stopped the car to take a closer look and it began to move away from me slowly heading east on Southwest Highway. I still didn’t believe my eyes so I began to move slowly and the object came to a standstill again and I immediately stopped the car and the object began to move away from me once more.  It moved slowly at first but then picked up speed and did a quarter circle turn heading north. I kept my eyes on the sky and about 30 seconds after it was out of view a military airplane, flying low and silent, came flying over head moving in the same direction the object was going. I only recognized the plane because I had seen it before on 9/11 after all commercial planes had been grounded and only military aircraft was in the air that night. I called my girlf! riend and her dad, who live in Hometown, at 11:48pm so maybe they could see it from there house but they didn’t see it. I circled the area for 30min, in hopes to maybe spot it again, but nothing appeared. When I arrived home I was terrified of the events that had just occurred so I called my room mate to meat me outside. I told him what had happened and even drew a picture of the object and to my surprise he found pictures of the object being spotted around the world dating back to 1965.;41.7279;-87.7309
