A friend and I were talking about shooting stars and different constellations.  Upon looking up, I noticed something blocking out some of the stars in the area where I was watching. I seen a series of lights and thought to myself, It's a plane.  However the light formation was like none I ever seen.  I continued to look at this plane.  My eyes adjusted to this plane and realized it was a round object with a set of very dim red lights. It was not a plane. It was a UFO.;41.7279;-87.7309
