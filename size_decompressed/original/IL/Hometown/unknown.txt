High speed white light !!!!!!!!!!!!!;2011-12-25 21:58:00;20 seconds;High speed white light !!!!!!!!!!!!! White light moving in a north east direction. This was definitely some sort of lighted  air craft.  The light was constant,no flashing.I estimate it's height at about 25,000 feet.  Speed was at least 4 times faster than any air craft I have ever seen. Living near Midway Airport,I am very familiar with low and high flying flights. I was very impressed with it's speed.In all probability,this was a military air craft.  Only the Midway controllers would know for sure.;41.7279;-87.7309
