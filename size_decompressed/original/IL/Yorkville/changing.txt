Bright round shaped ufo that shot straight up into the sky for about 3 weeks.;2008-02-11 04:00:00;2-3 hours;Bright round shaped ufo that shot straight up into the sky for about 3 weeks. I had seen what at first seemed to be a really bright star out at about 4:30 in the morning.  Then I noticed it was moving about eraticly then it would stop changed colors to bright white to a dim white.  It was a good distance from me high in the nights sky.  What was really  wierd is that I saw this UFO for about 3 weeks straight.  I got a telescope to try to see it close up and then It appeared to actually be a triangle shaped craft and then would get really bright giving it a round ball shape.  I tape recorded it one night and the movements I got and video was that of a bright ball moving side to side up and down.  My digital pictures turned out better and you'll see a bright round shape but when I zoomed in 4x on the photo the triangle shaped ship can be seen. I'm not sure what to call it other than a UFO.  I've been laughed at by my husband who seen it with his own eyes and chaulked it up to being a satalite.  Once I watched it from 5 AM to 7 AM when it was early blue sky out and it looked like just a star but no stars were out other than this ufo I watched suddenly took off shot straight up and in about 5 seconds was gone.  I couldn't sleep for a while and would wait to see it. I admit I was excited and a little creeped out at the same time.  But after 3 weeks all this activity stopped.  Now I'm more convinced there are things out of this world but what it was I can't say really. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
