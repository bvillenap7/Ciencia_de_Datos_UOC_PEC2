Bonfire ufo sighting by 15+ people in Yorkville, IL.;2014-05-24 22:00:00;2 minutes;Bonfire ufo sighting by 15+ people in Yorkville, IL Me and about 15 other friends were sitting around a bonfire last night, we all at once looked up to see a bright red-ish ball of light in the sky, I know for a fact that it was a possible UFO and or 'being' and was not a conventional aircraft.   I see normal aircraft on approach to chicago airports Midway and O'hare all that time.  This object moved slowly then stopped 3 different times then went straight down towards the earth at crazys speeds than stopped around 10k feet for about 5 seconds and without a sound vanished as if it were never there.  This is my first time ever seeing something like this, and kind of scared us.   I am still having a hard time understanding what we all saw last night.;41.6473117647059;-88.4424147058823
