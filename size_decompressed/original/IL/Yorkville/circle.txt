Power goes out, brite high in the sky moving all over;2008-08-28 23:50:00;4 minutes;Power goes out, brite high in the sky moving all over My daughter,age 20 looked out her bedroom window which is on the second level of our home.  She looked out just right after the power went out in the house. It was a still night, mild temp's, and no wind.  She saw a light in the which was bigger then a star moving around in a up and down, side way movement.  She knew it wasn't an airplane, since one had just past.  Her window faces south.  She called to her bother in the next room to come and look.  He witness the lite and it's movements, She got her camera, zoomed in as close as possible and captured the lite for a minute or so. The power came back on and the object was gone. The lite was white, looked like a star, so the shape looks to us like a circle.  They showed me the video in the morning and I could tell they were both a bit freaked out by it.  Com-Ed was called that night and they could not tell them what was the cause of the power outage.;41.6473117647059;-88.4424147058823
