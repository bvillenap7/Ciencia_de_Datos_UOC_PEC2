We turned towards the crafts and followed them until we could not see them anymore because they were drifting away too fast over the horizen.  while we were following them we could see at least 10 ships then one went  straight over our truck.  When it was straight above us it was about the same size as a full moon but it looked like it was still pretty high in the air.  We then watched the U.F.O fly away over the horizen rizing slowly until the shipes one by one were out of site.  The ships looked like they were all together about 1 inch from eachother in the sky, accurately about 1 mile apart in the sky but they still looked close enough to be together.;41.6473117647059;-88.4424147058823
