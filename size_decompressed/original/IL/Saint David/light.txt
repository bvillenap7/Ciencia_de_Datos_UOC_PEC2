((HOAX??))  Lights seen in the night sky.;1999-09-25 23:30:00;2 minutes;Lights seen in the night sky. I was driving home from work, one night, on a very clear night.  St. David is a very small town in Illinois, and I was leaving the town, when I saw a light show up in the sky directly in front of me.  I thought maybe it was a comet or shooting star, but it was just a little bit different.  It got bigger and bigger.  I think it was the color of most stars at first.  Then, it disappeared as if it was turned off by an old television remote control.  Moments later, a light reappeared, I think the first color was orange.  Then it changed colors.  Then there were a couple of lights around the first one.  It seems like there were about three lights in a row changing colors: red, green, blue, yellow, orange, I think.  It seemed almost like a light show you'd see at a rock concert.  Then, I remember them all becoming one much bigger light and then disappeared, almost like it had zoomed away.  That was it. It was amazing.  I wanted it to return but it did not. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));40.4872;-90.0507
