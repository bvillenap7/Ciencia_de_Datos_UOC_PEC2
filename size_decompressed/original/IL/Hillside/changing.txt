I then observed what appeared to be a oval shaped ball of red fire movely very slowly (not an airplane either) northeast in the sky.   After looking for several minutes and not being able to make out what the flying object was, I alerted my neighbor, who looked through my binoculars, observed the object, but he to was not able to make it out.  He then went and retreived his binoculars, but was unable to make it out.  Upon continuous observation, the flying object then changed its' shape from oval to oblong, still moving very slow. It appeared to flying at approximately 30-35 thousand feet up.  I watched it continue to move very slowly northeast until it disappeared.
