I live in a wooded area and a fly zone.  But this was different.  The object didn't move at all. It stayed in the same place.  The airplanes move across the sky.  There were many bright little circles of white lights in the shape of a circle.  It wasn't a solid circle of light.  They would flash very brightly.  Sometimes they would change color.  Then at 3:00 AM they just disappeared.;41.7361;-87.878
