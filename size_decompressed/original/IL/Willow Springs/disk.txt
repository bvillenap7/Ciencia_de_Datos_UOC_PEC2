I was looking up at the cumulos clouds gathering and saw 2 saucer shaped crafts just hovering motionless. I knew they were not birds because a plane flew underneath them, too high to be birds. After a minute or so watching them hover in the same spot, they darted to the nearest cloud for cover it seemed. I waited for them to come out on the other side, or same side and they never did. This seems to be on-going southwest of Chicago.;41.7361;-87.878
