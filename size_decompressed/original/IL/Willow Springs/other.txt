As I was looking at the stars, one of them started moving.  It started going north kind of slowly.   I watched it for about 5 minutes.  I totally got bit up by mosquitoes, but it was so interesting to me.  It looked like a star moving across the sky slowly.   It was not a meteor.  It was not a plane, it was too high up.
