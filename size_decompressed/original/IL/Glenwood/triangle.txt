Triangular object with very bright lights hovers over suburb, then vanishes.;2000-09-15 19:00:00;5 minutes;Triangular object with very bright lights hovers over suburb, then vanishes. Myself and another person first obsrved a band of very bright lights while looking north east. The center lights were brighter than the lights on either end. We first thought it may a plane but the lights were too bright. They were as bright as the lights in a sports stadium and it wasnt completely dark outside. We drove east to get a better look and ended up below the object. It was triangular and had approx 8-10 very bright lights shinig down. The object hovered in one place for about 30 seconds without moving. There was no noise form the object. It then rotated and left very quickly in a northeasterly direction. The rear of the object had only two  red lights, one on each side, which were flashing. The object vanished within seconds.;41.5507;-87.6123
