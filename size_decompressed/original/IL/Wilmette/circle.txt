I was at a friends house one night in the summer. We were on there trampoline just talking and lokking out at the stars when suddenly, I noticed a red little dot moving. As if it was moving around the stars! I quickly paused and thought if this was a UFO. I wasn't thinking about much, then just as I told someone about cause it was getting bigger and I was getting nervous, it disappeared. Then five minutes later it came back except it was  really small to see. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));42.077;-87.7209
