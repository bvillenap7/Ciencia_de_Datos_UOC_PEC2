Huge, black cube shaped object floating in the night sky.;1998-05-08 22:00:00;5 Minutes;Huge, black cube shaped object floating in the night sky. It all started when we were in the suburb of Orland Park, about an hour outside of Chicago. My friend and I were getting a bite to eat and then were going to head back to his place in Palos Heights for the evening.  The way back to his house was straight down a major roadway, Harlem Ave. We were on 151st and South Harlem and we needed to get to 123rd and Harlem. From 151st to about 135th consists of driving through forest preserve. I was behind the steering wheel that night. As soon as we began heading North, I noticed a super-bright, white light in the sky that was not far off in the distance. I asked my friend what he thought it was. He replied a star but no star is THAT bright. As we proceeded on our way, I noticed the light never seemed to move. We approached the intersection of 143rd and Harlem and encountered the light, which was actually shining from the object. It was dark and cube-shaped like a huge, black box floating in the night sky. We could see it's outline in the air, It was darker than the sky. We got stopped at a red light and we both stared up through the windshield at the craft. It had the singular light that was beaming down onto the roadway. This thing was huge, it was like a perfect square building that was floating. All the sides appeared to be smooth. It was moving south in the air under 10MPH and made NO SOUND as it moved. When the stoplight turned green, we proceeded on our way, rather dumbfounded. We were both about 18-19 years old and had never seen anything like this before. I don't think we knew how to react. We were just saying to ourselves, OK, that was different...  Also, perhaps worthy of note, 143rd and Harlem in the general area of Bachelors Grove Cemetary, one of the most haunted places in the Midwest. It's about a 2 minute drive east of the intersection we encountered the craft. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));41.6352;-87.7325
V-shaped with two glowing orange lights tarveling southeast;2007-01-01 20:21:00;20 sec.;V-shaped with two glowing orange lights tarveling southeast On 1/1/07 I was out with my binoculars looking at the stars and a V-shaped object with one glowing orange glow on both wings. I looked like it was about 5,000 feet up and was the size of a 747 plane and moving in a south east direction. I could only see it though the benoculars and not with the naked eye. It moved very fast and there was no sound at all.;41.6352;-87.7325
