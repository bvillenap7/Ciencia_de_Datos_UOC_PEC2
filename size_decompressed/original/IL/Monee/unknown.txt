Two bright objects just south of Chicago never moving, just fad away.;2007-11-17 20:15:00;2.5 min;Two bright objects just south of Chicago never moving, just fad away. At the stated time above I saw two bright objects with a magnitude of around -2.0 roughly 15 degrees SE of the constellation of Cassiopea.  Both objects did not move or make a sound.  The lower object would then start to dim and eventually the upper object would start to dim off.  Both would turn off at the same time.   There was a meteor shower going on at the same time, but there is no evidence of meteors falling toward my home.  I am an amateur astonomer and have been for over 25 years.  I also write a column on astronomy.  I can not ID these objects.;41.4182;-87.774
