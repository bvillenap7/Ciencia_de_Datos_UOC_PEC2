Dark triangular wing in night sky;2011-11-17 22:00:00;20 seconds;Dark triangular wing in night sky On the evening of Nov. 11, 2011, I was walking my dog at 22:00.  The night sky was clear, there were no clouds and the temperature was in the low 30’s F.  There was moderate ambient light from the streetlights and neighborhood homes.  While gazing at the night sky I noticed an irregularity of movement in the sky overhead.  I could not focus on it at first when it was directly overhead but as it moved away from me, I started to discern a shape to the form.  It was triangular with truncated tips.  The leading two edges of the form had what appeared to be a series of round soft edge openings that where slightly lighter than the main body of the object.  There were approx. 12 of these.   Their outline was not hard but was soft edged and appeared to be in motion.   The object itself was as black as the night sky.  There were no running lights thhat would normally be associated with an aircraft.  There were no other discernable features only the silhouette of shape with the leading edge feature. The object made no noise and it moved from the northwest to the southeast.  I would guesstimate it’s altitude to be approx two to three thousand feet.  The span of the object was significant along the trailing edge, approx. 300 feet.  The incident was approximately 20 seconds in duration from when I first noticed until it disappeared in the southeast horizon.;41.4182;-87.774
