I was laying on my recliner, on my balcony looking up towards the corner of my rooftop looking towards the ecliptic, when a black, silent triangular object flew directly over my center of view, about 100 ft (or  less )above me,   I followed it with my eyes & noticed a discernable winged/angular structure, with what looked like 2 dark colored stripes from front to back on the underside,  I live next to a shopping center parking lot with nighttime lot/building lighting which illuminated the underside dramatically!  The overall color was composite gray/black(stealth) maybe 10-12 long , 15-20ft wide!  If not for the stars (cloudless night) & the illunination of the underside which showed linear structure, it could have easily blended in w/nighttime sky!  It moved silently due north at a slow speed, no sound over Rt.64 & went out of my line of sight (Rt.64 is 100-120 yards away)  there were no nav lights, no sounds, I was frozen in my chair until it passed, normally I have my bincoculars with me, but was not expecting this kind of flyover!
