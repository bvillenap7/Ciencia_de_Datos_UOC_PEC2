Then as I did a double take I noticed that the perimeter of the “owl” was lit up, as if it was lined with small pin lights. The object glided over the back yard and headed south.  Before I could get my husband to look up it had glided away.  I told my husband, “I think I just saw a UFO!”   We talked about it for a few minutes but when he didn’t really believe it was a UFO I convinced myself that yes it was a large owl and the neighbors’ lights had lit up the underside of its feathers. About 10 minutes later I decided to go back inside and when I stood up to get out the object flew over the front yard area of our house.  I was able to say, “Look, look there it is!” and point quick enough that my husband saw it too.  He was shocked and immediately called it a Dinosaur!!  It had the shape of a Pterodactyl with its full wing span spread out wide.  Again it glided over the house and was gone.  I mentioned the lights to my husband and he didn’t remember seeing them, I saw them plainly the second time it flew by. My husband was ready to go in at that point, so we jumped out and headed into the house.  Once we dried off we walked out of the front door to look up into the sky but of course it was gone and we saw nothing else.;39.1235;-88.5672
