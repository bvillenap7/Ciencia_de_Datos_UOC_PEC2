ILLinois. siting;1995-09-10 20:00:00;30sec;ILLinois. siting Iwas talking to My coe Driver about the ufo siting I had in the ozarks and some of the other stories I have heard over the years. He was dumfounded. He asked Me if I really belived they are real,and I said I know they are. A minute or two went by and yaled look! From the South moving North at 3000 feet and moving down at an angle in a somewhat gerky movement like something was wrong. It dissapeared over the trees to the north. The CB came alive, several drivers had seen it and was asking what that was,so I told them. And then it got silent.

Large Dark object hovering over forest area behind a subdivision, disappeared when I got close to it.;2017-10-12 16:15:00;3 minutes;Large Dark object hovering over forest area behind a subdivision, disappeared when I got close to it. I was driving into my neighborhood after picking up my daughter from school.  I saw something flying behind our subdivision over a forest area.  I got my phone out and started recording it.  It was moving very slowly and at first I thought maybe it was a drone.  It was way to large to be a drone though.  As I got closer to it, I turned off my video to turn it to camera to take a pic and I looked back up and it was gone.  I drove home to grab something at my house and as I am pulling out my driveway I see it again, just slowly moving and hovering over the forest again.  As I got closer I tried to get my camera view on again and it disappeared again.  That was it, but I did get a view of it on video.  My phone would not work for a little bit either.  I couldnâ€™t call anyone or upload the video at first.;39.1235;-88.5672
