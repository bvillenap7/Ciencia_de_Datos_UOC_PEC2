Bright silver object(s) on I-80;2002-02-22 15:00:00;3 in 13 min.;Bright silver object(s) on I-80 Looking west from I-80 at around 3pm, I saw a bright silver object that was in shape of an irregular circle. The sky was a beautiful blue with a few scattered clouds so visibility was not a problem. At first I thought it was an airplane that was reflecting the sun and I was waiting for it to fly overhead. But when it morphed into a white chevron shape and then disappeared, I was in disbelief. This object did not leave a trail at all. I noticed that the planes on that day did. I then drove west on I-80 towards La Salle and saw another object that was in the same shape as the first object. It also morphed and then disappeared. I then saw another one which also morphed and disappeared. At this point, I prayed to our Heavenly Father that with the shed blood of Jesus Christ to protect me from these Nephilim.  When I did not see another one,I started to doubt what I saw until I noticed another driver searching the sky.  This all happened in the span of about 13 minutes.;41.3497;-88.8415000000001
