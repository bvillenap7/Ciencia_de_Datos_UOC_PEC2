green lights circling from cloud to cloud;2006-04-19 00:30:00;30 min.;green lights circling from cloud to cloud My son and I went for a walk and upon coming back noticed a green light circling in the clouds.  We started walking faster and upon coming to a clearing in the sky, noticed no lights.  We slowed down and all of a sudden above us in the cloud was the green circling light.  We were so afraid that we almost ran home about 6 blocks.  The circling green light appeared to jump from cloud to cloud.;41.3497;-88.8415000000001

Strange fire-like lights in the sky (3 total) near Ottawa, IL, that extinguished after a few minutes, leaving only a red light.;2015-08-01 21:30:00;2 minutes;Strange fire-like lights in the sky (3 total) near Ottawa, IL, that extinguished after a few minutes, leaving only a red light. It was approximately 21:30 on Saturday, August 1st, 2015.  I was driving west on Rt. 71 in Ottawa, Illinois.  My passenger looks out her window and says, “What is that?  Can you see that?”   I look to the North and there are three lines in the sky, obviously ablaze, similar to fireworks trailing.   I drive a few blocks further west and pull over into the hospital parking lot, where we watch these lights for another minute. 	The lights are orange and cylindrical, and appear to be fire-like.  They look like they’re falling, but not fast.  Simply falling toward the Earth.  Not shooting across the sky like a meteor.  Then, one at a time, they go out.  Each one approximately 10 seconds later than the one before it.  When they go out, all that remains is a red light in the sky, similar to that seen on an aircraft.;41.3497;-88.8415000000001
