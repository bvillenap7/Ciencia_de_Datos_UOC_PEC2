I was not taking a pic of the object and only notice it when reviewing pic. Ottawa Illinois. Corner of W McKinley and Dairy Ln looking west. Friday May 22 2020 at about 0910. Took pictures of cloud formations.  Did not see any objects in pictures until I stopped the vehicle about 30 seconds after taking pictures.  The first picture shows what I believe to be a bird.  The second and third pictures show something else.  The object just looked like a white spot.  Didnâ€™t seem to be a cloud.  When zoomed  though...... it sure the heck looks like the navy tic-tac to me.  First pic taken through windshield.  2nd and 3rd taken with no obstructions.;41.3497;-88.8415000000001
