I was walking north, when I just happen to be looking at the clear, beautiful night sky, and all the stars, when a huge fireball started streaking downward from about the middle of the sky, to just below the tree line.  I started telling everyone there, mostly family, to look at this thing.  I pointed and said what is that?  Of course nobody had an answer and we just watched it burning up the atmosphere.  I was waiting for an atomic mushroom cloud to light up the night sky, but the fireball just faded out after about at least a minute of watching it burn toward the Earth.;41.3497;-88.8415000000001
line of 15-20 reddish orange fireballs flying above tree line;2011-09-20 22:00:00;1 minute;line of 15-20 reddish orange &quotfireballs&quot flying above tree line I was headed west on the north side of town, on my way to a friends house who was having a camp fire in his back yard. Where he lives there are a woods right in his back yard. So as I was less than a half mile away, I could see the trees that extended into his yard. I came to the last turn I needed to make and just happened to look up above the tree line. There was 15-20 reddish orange balls of light moving from south to north in a line, not a straight line but they were grouped together in a somewhat jagged line. They were all about as big as my nail on my pinky finger held out at arms length. They were all moving at the same slow but steady speed. I immediately called my friend whose house I was going to, I could see his house from where I was so I told him to get out in his front yard and look at this. As I was on the phone, a woman from another house came out, probably because she heard me yelling about it on the phone with my friend as I was very excite! d to see this. She immediately got on her phone as well and watched the strange objects. It was not but a minute later that these objects disappeared into the tree line and never came out. Two of my friends, including the one I called, seen exactly as I saw. I heard no specific sounds coming from them, but they did look close enough that they should be making a sound. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));41.3497;-88.8415000000001
