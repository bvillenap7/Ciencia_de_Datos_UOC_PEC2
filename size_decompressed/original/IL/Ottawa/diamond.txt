My cousin and I were out with my telescope 10 miles or so from any cities. Around 10:00pm my cousin yelled out, What is that? I turned around to see a bright coma shaped white smudge in the sky about 40 degrees above the southeast horizon. It fell slowly downward and faded out. About 5 seconds later same exact light appeared again in the same spot. It faded out also. We both turned to each other trying to figure out what it was. I looked back in the direction the lights were observed and saw 2 dirty orange lights. They were just below Jupiter. I grabbed my telescope to see what they were and looked thru the finder scope. Once I got top light in sight I looked thru my telescope and seen the object. It had five white lights in a diamond/bell formation with a large red light on the top. Observed for 5 seconds before it moved. I look back to find it with my eyes and both were gone. Then one reappeared hover about 40 degrees above the horizon and moved left slowly and stopped. Then moved right very fast It began to pulsate white then turned bright red and disappeared to the south. Five minutes later another orange light appeared in the east sky. It would move a little to the south and stop. It did this for about 10 seconds before disappearing. It was very disturbing and unlike anything I've ever seen. I observe the night sky 3-5 times a week. I know what planes, jets, and helicopters look like. It looked like two object entering the atmosphere at first.;41.3497;-88.8415000000001
