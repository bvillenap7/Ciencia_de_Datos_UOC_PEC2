The sky was clear except for very high brushing of clouds. I watch the object waiting to see the supposed Hawk flap his wings.  Thats when a Jet flying into O'hare at about 18 thousand feet flew over.  The jet was lower then the object I thought was a hawk in the high sky. I watch the object which was dark gray or light black fly South South east in a Wooble pattern as best as I can explain. It didnt travel straight, more of a curve in the sky.  My best guess at the size would be about 20 feet long in an egg shape. The object made no noise at all.  Wind was blowing out of the west that day.  Im curious if anyone besides me and my son seen this. It was nothing I had ever seen before.;41.3497;-88.8415000000001
