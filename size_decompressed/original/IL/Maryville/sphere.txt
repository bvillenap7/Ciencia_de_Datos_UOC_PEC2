Saw a singular large, bright orange sphere materialize over the cornfield behind my house and then speed off across the field where it seemed to disappear in mid air.  It traveled south to north, I heard no noise coming from the object, saw no tail, and saw no other lights.  My dog did not seem to react to this object.;38.7168000000001;-89.9727000000001
