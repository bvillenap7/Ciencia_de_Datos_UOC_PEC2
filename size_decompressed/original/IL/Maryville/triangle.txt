Maryville, IL., triangular craft seen through night vision moving high and fast 8-30-07;2007-08-30 23:10:00;6 seconds;Maryville, IL., triangular craft seen through night vision moving high and fast 8-30-07 I was using my night vision, I am a private detective, to view the stars.  While simply looking around, a triangular craft flew from the north west to the south east, about 150 degrees heading south-south east, EXTREMLY fast. Two lights on each side and one on the center making a flat triangular shape.  I first thought it was 5 craft flying in formation, but the lights never moved relative to each other, so logic tells me it had to be one craft.  If so, it was HUGE and faster than any craft I've ever seen or heard of. No clouds in the sky, clear night, moon shining very brightly off to my east.  This was not a meteor.  If it were a military jet, there would have been sound associated with it, NO sound and must have been doing 4,000 to 6,000 miles per hour and the altitude must have been 30 to 40 thousand feet or possibly much higher.  Very large, fast and high.;38.7168000000001;-89.9727000000001
