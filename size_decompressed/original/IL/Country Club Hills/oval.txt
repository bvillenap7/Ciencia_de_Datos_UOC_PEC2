It was Thursday, February 27, 2020, between 4pm and 4:30pm. After several grey and snowy days, this day was bright, blue and sunny. S he looked up and saw what she said was a bright, shiny, metallic vehicle that was in the shape of a clam shell, but without the clamshell ridges.  There was no noise.  There were no vapour trails.  She was in disbelief and is a skeptic by nature.  She did not know how high up it was, but said that if she used her finger and thumb, it was 3 inches across from her point of view.  All she wants to know is if anyone else saw it.  Thank you.;41.5654;-87.7228
