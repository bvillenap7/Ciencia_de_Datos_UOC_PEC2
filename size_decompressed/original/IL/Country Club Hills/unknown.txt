I was driving on a road that goes past the highschool, and that miniture golf place, and the CCH park (for lack of the name of the road). I was headed east from harlem and while passing the park i looked up at what i thought was an airplane. The lights were situate so that when viewed from a more horizontal angle it looked just like an airplanes lights and i would have thought so with no second guessing.  Except i saw it from a more verticle angle also,and noticed an area(much larger than that an airplane would occupy) in a sort of squarish mass that seemed to be reflecting a faux sky, that was almost identical to the sky around the object, except it had a sort of glimming quality and shifted slightly like a liqued. Much like how a road is sometimes cloaked in the distance by an imagine pool of water on a hott day, is how this object was masked,except for the lights. As i drove away and to a more horizontal viewing point,i kept looking back at it, i wish i could say the exact angle it was that you could no longer notice the mirrage quality covering up its actual shape and size,but it remained for a while until i drove around 300-500 yards down the road and it appeared from the lights to be an airplane again.
