There were lots of other aircraft with signal strobes flying in my area for the next hour or so immediately following this sighting, propeller aircraft and rotor aircraft - dark in color.;37.8043;-88.2663
This fireball was different than most I have seen.. it was a lot higher in the sky ... but still was too low and slow to be a plane.. (;2012-04-05 19:45:00;10 minutes +/-;This fireball was different than most I have seen.. it was a lot higher in the sky ... but still was too low and slow to be a plane.. (about 300ft altitude- est 50-75mph). In the past, the other ones I've seen were just over the tree tops n telephone poles (30-50 ft altitude- est. 5-15mph).  likewise with previous fireballs I have seen, this object made NO sound at all.  Object appeared to under intelligent control - making erratic altitude changes and changing direction 90 degrees one time. First seen south of Ridgway, the object traveled Northeast at a constant rate of speed, while climbing in altitude slowly. Incredibly bright orange.. just like the others.  This particular object seemed to be MUCH larger than the others I've seen like it, and varied in it's ambient light intensity.. Lit up my neighborhood bright orange, as the sun was setting (completely different color) - and the setting sun could not illuminate where I was - on the west side of my homes structure.  Weather conditions at time of sighting were clear skies, dusk, 58*F - Winds from the N-NE at 9mph (information taken from Hourly Weather on weather.com for zipcode 62979 (this object DID NOT follow the prevailing winds at anytime.);37.8043;-88.2663
