While placing wood into my firebox, I noticed a weird reflection on the metal within seconds of hearing my friend yell.  I turned around and faced the southern sky and say 5 bright objects, 4 were blueish white in color, the other - larger one, was changing in color.  the like colored objects were moving in very sharp, tight formations, changing altitude and direction in unison - towards the brighter object.  All of them seemed to disappear either into or behind the brighter one, which began pulsating colors from blue to green to red to white to yellow and repeating.. it stayed very high in the sky moving quickly back and forth for a few minutes - before sharply dropping in altitude and emitting a very bright beam of light which lit up my entire neighborhood in extremely bright white light and spinning very fast increasing in color intensity and decreasing in altitude... sti! ll very high in the sky.  we stood there, frozen (it felt like minutes, couldnt have been more than 30sec) to me.. he said it felt surreal and empowering.  After the light dissipated, I immediately ran inside and filed this report.;37.8043;-88.2663
