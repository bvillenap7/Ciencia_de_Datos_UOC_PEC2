It was total dark at the edge of town.  When I looked toward the South I seen this coming and it stayed the same height and speed.  Did not look to be very far up.  It went due north and there was no signs.  I took a picture of it with my phone which turned out.  It was a orange color with a long nose and ball type at end.;37.8043;-88.2663
