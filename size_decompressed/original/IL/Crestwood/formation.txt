I heard a weird noise kind of like a fan turning, and I looked up and saw this bright light falling out of the sky, I thought I never have seen a falling star so I watched, and watched and it came real low and I was scared that I should wake my family up so that this thing wouldn't hit the house.  It flattened out and surfed, and it had a line of lights on it (the bottom) it cruised, I was paralyzed star struck stood up not knowing what to do it surfed and next thing you knew it went straight up. I wanted to run in and grab a camera or wake up mu husband but I was to scared to not watch this thing go away.  I am freaking out right now, that was the weirdest thing I have ever seen in my life.  I can't beleive I saw that.  I am scared to even tell anyone they would think I was nits.  Wholy crap is all I have to say.;41.6482;-87.7321
formation of UFO's;2008-04-15 12:00:00;10 mins;formation of UFO's My wife and I were standing out on our backporch when these 5 hovering craft flew in from the Northeast at very high speed. They stopped over the shopping center on Rt 83 and Cicero Ave and hovered for about 10 minutes. Then they took off very fast towards space.;41.6482;-87.7321
