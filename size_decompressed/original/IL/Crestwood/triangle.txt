Triangular Matte Black Object against clear East pre sunrise sky in Crestwood IL;2009-03-30 06:00:00;5 Minutes;Triangular Matte Black Object against clear East pre sunrise sky in Crestwood IL On March 30, 2009 at 6:00 AM I witnessed a flying black triangle in the vicinity of 127th and Route 83 in Crestwood IL. I was heading to work traveling Eastbound on 127 Th Street from Ridgeland Ave toward Cicero Ave. It was a clear and bright Eastern sky with the sun still below the horizon. As I arrived up to a stop light at 127 Th and Central Ave a triangular pitch black matte object that stuck out like a sore thumb against the predawn sunrise caught my attention due to its size, and orientation. It appeared to be heading from a Northeast position over I-294 to Southwest toward Palos Heights at 135th and Ridgeland while I was stopped at the intersection of 127 Th and Central Ave. Once the light changed the object was still traversing on a Southwesterly line as it passed with in 1 block of where I was located at a height of about 500 feet. As it was passing my vantage point I opened the sun roof on my vehicle to follow it as closely as possible and to listen for any sounds. Once it past what I will call the 5 O clock position over my right shoulder it disappeared from my sightline out of the sun roof and I lost contact with it between Central Ave and Route 83 on 127 Th Street.;41.6482;-87.7321
