Fireballs over Illinois.;2015-08-22 23:45:00;1 minute;Fireballs over IL. Red fireball shaped objects observed 2 weeks ago.   1st object came from the southeast flying slowly west.   Once that one went overhead, another came from the same direction, moments later.  And  after about 15 seconds, the fireball shaped object split into 2, and flew overhead.   After 10 seconds another appeared from the same direction.  This event happened at approximately 10 pm. Last night while standing on my porch I saw another fireball like object fly overhead.   These were NOT airplanes!;41.6482;-87.7321
