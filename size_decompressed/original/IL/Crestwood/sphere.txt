Spherical object maintains position in sky for ten minutes over approach path to Midway Airport;2007-08-31 14:30:00;10 Minutes;Spherical object maintains position in sky for ten minutes over approach path to Midway Airport At 2:30 in the afternoon on August 31st I was waiting for my wife outside of a shopping complex at 135th and Cicero in Crestwood, Illinois, when I noticed a spherical object hovering in the sky.  I noticed it while watching aircraft using the 4R approach to Midway airport.  Aircraft at that point in their approach are flying at about 2500 feet and the object appeared to be at twice that altitude.  It was, like the airport itself, directly north of my position and about 60 degrees above the horizon line.  The object maintained its exact position in the sky for 10 minutes, though, as its coloring shifted from white to gray, it may have been rotating.  The object then proceeded south and flew directly over my position.  As it did so its coloring shifted from bright white to black and then back again.  It continued to fly off to the south and I lost sight of it.  I hold an aircraft mechanic's license and served in the USAF as a jet engine mechanic from 1972-1976.  I am certain that the object was neither a fixed nor rotary winged aircraft.;41.6482;-87.7321
