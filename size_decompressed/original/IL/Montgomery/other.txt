I was watching other aircraft heading towards O'hare in Chicago.  Looking toward the north, almost overhead, I noticed two blips kind of reflecting the sun in the sky.  They were separated a ways apart.  Almost like a star.   But the sun was shining in a clear blue sky.  As I watched, they were moving.  I got my binoculars to see better and found the one blip was actually two objects so small I could see no shape, but they were moving in a southerly direction.  Keeping the same distance apart until I could no longer see them.;41.7191;-88.3304
