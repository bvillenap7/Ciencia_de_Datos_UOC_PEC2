Huge object hovers then disappears?;2011-04-12 14:30:00;4 Sec;Huge object hovers then disappears? So I went out to my back yard right after my friend had left to smoke a cigarette.  A bird fly's really low behind me to my right so I look to the right.  Which is south and i'm facing east where the sun rises from.  I see this really big bright metallic elongated disc looking thing.  I had to turn away because the reflection of the sun on this thing hurt my eyes.  I look back with my hand trying to shade my eyes from the reflection and see this thing still there only for like a second before it just disappears. It made no noise at all the whole time.  So I finish my cigarette and see two air planes get kind of close to each other.  One small plane heading south and one larger commercial air liner heading east. The eastward plane seemed to fly into some invisible haze.  The sky was blue with no clouds in the area. The plain was still somewhat visible and I could hear the both planes like I normally do.
