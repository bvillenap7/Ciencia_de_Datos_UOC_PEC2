Low flying green blinking sphere;2012-05-23 21:45:00;2 seconds;Low flying green blinking sphere I stepped out onto my back porch at around 9:45 PM CST, when I saw a green light out of the corner of my eye.  The green light was an orb, the center being bright green, and the outside being a hazy translucent green.  The center appeared to be blinking.  The object was around 50 yards from me, and appeared to be a little higher that the telephone pole/wires in my back yard.  It could not have been very high, as it disappeared behind the trees in my neighbors yard.  The object made no sound, and was moving close to (estimate) 60 mph.  I waited for quite a while to see if it would fly back around, thinking it was possibly some sort of RC Toy.  It never came back.  I was unable to photograph/video the object.;41.179;-88.3347
