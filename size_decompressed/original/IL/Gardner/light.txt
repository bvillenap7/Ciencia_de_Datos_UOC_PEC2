Unexplained bliking lights in Illinois.;2012-01-05 20:00:00;8 minutes;Unexplained bliking lights in Illinois. While driving west on our way home, we noticed 6 very distincitive blinking lights hovering in the sky approx 15 miles away. These lights were blinking from orange to white to green and yellow. One of the lights dropped quite a ways down and then just stopped.  All 6 lights then proceeded to make two large perfectly shaped triangles next to each other and the distance between the lights forming each triangle was approximately 1 mile.  The way these lights moved was very fluid, not moving in the air like any normal aircraft.  The tri angle formed for approx. 30 to 45 seconds and then broke up. The top two lights just disappearing and two others moved to the north.   We drove to our home about 2 minutes away and brough our son and mother in law out to see what we had seen.  We then all got inot our car and drove west about a mile and parked on the side of the road and got out.  Two of the craft were still there and hovering low in the horizon.  Both were blinking the ! same colors as mentioned above.  One of the lights then turned a brilliant white color and appeared to grow slightly in size.  The light the dimmed and started blinking again and both lights headed north.  My wife and I had our cell phones out and tried to photograph and record these lights.  On my video, only two of the lights would show up, although they were all equal in brightness.  My wife took numerous photos with her phone and all turned out black with the exception of one photo.  This one shows 3 of the crafts forming one of the triangle formations they formed.  These lights appeared to be above an area where there are large windmills located.  There was no noise that we could hear from any of these crafts.;41.179;-88.3347
