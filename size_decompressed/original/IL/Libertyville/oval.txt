After all the kids had left, I went out to clean up.  I took the cake box to burn it and after I threw the box into the fire, as I turned to go back into the house, I was facing west and above the tree line (trees are approximately 50 feet tall), there was an oval shaped object that was hovering, not moving, no noise..  It just stayed there.  The sky was clear and no wind. I can’t judge how big it was or how high up in the sky but above the tree line (50 ft. trees). It was about the size of a neighbor’s 50- foot wide house two acres away, but up in the sky.  I stood there alone, in disbelief for about 15 seconds and ran to get my fiancé.  I ran about 100ft. to the deck of the house and turned again to look and it was gone.  I went into the house to explain what I saw.  I could hardly speak. I called my dad (a former pilot) and he asked for a description and told me to call the police.  I didn’t.  I thought they would think I’m crazy.  I drew a picture.  It seemed to be dark in color with a wide band going horizontally through the center of the object.  It also had, on each side, as like handles on a cooking pot, underneath, red lights that zigzagged, but only on the sides.  I will send the sketch tomorrow.;42.2853;-87.9532
