Driving home from work one night, around 11:00 pm, in the north sky, I saw 4 or 5 orange-yellow lights, that were circle-shaped, appear in the sky. All of them disappeared and then reappeared and seemed to be moving in a straight line, almost seemed like a light show like you see on lights around a movie poster or something. Then one light got bigger, and then disappeared. It lasted for about 30 or 40 seconds.;40.3825;-90.1484
