Ring doorbell caught image of light and spaceship;2020-02-25 03:28:00;Seconds;Ring doorbell caught image of light and spaceship Our Ring doorbell on back porch kept going off but no one was there.  Next day I looked at all the motion and was able to see a bright light high over our back garage.. appears maybe even a figure in the light and off to the right was a saucer like with 3 lights.  I could furnish a picture.  I was able to screenshot it but now it is gone when I look for it in the ring footage.  Evens shows the time of the early morning.  So strange!;40.3825;-90.1484
