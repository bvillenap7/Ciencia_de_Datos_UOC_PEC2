((anonymous report));2019-04-16 21:35:00;5 minutes;Red and white lights on flying objects that appeared to be rotating.  Lights disappeared and reappeared.  Gone in 5 minutes. Red and white lights off in the distance looked to be parts of 2 or 3 flying objects, at least one of which was rotating somewhat slowly.  The lights disappeared and then reappeared, eventually disappearing over some trees from our front porch view point.   I tried to get some video, but it was dark and it doesn't show much.   Not sure what it was, but we've never seen anything quite like this before. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));40.3825;-90.1484
