Extremely bright non flickering red light moving quickly over town and disappears in the west.;2016-04-12 20:10:00;20 seconds;Extremely bright non flickering red light moving quickly over town and disappears in the west. Looked north out the window and saw a bright steady red light in the sky moving fast from east to west.  Thought it was a helicopter but no noise.   Ran to front of house to observe the light moving faster and in a blink of the eye disappeared quickly in the west.  My wife came to the front and saw the light.  The light was a extremely bright leaving no trail of smoke.  The height of the light seemed high in the sky.  The light passed directly over Mt. Carmel, Il.;38.4133;-87.7865
