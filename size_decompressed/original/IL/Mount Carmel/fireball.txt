I am an ((deleted)) Engineering tech and my wife is ((medical specialist)). We saw orange lights below the cloud cover in the northern sky. they would change in size and brilliance, wink out and once on blinked out then flashed once very brightly. they usually appeard to be stopped, but after they would blink out, a minute or so later they would show up in a different location. First the apparent movement was to the west, but a few minutes later when the lights reappeared they stayed on and moved to the east. We also noticed several blinking white pinpoints of light in the general area of the larger orange lights. These appeared as twinkling stars, except that they did not appear to be stationary, actually they were more random in their position. The Orange lights at their largest might have been about half the diameter of a dime held out at arms length. I estimate our distance from the objects to be about 1.5 - 2 miles. we watched from our car out on some country roads. We saw them from two close locations (about 50 yards appart), and got out of the car and watched them both times. Later we move to a location that I thought would be closer but we did not see them again. I have seen the same things before with my daughter in the same general area arount last Thanksgiving. I know several others who have seen and described the same things in the same general location.;38.4133;-87.7865
