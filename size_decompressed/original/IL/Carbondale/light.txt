Bright light moving across sky at very fast speed & very high alttitude;2000-08-27 20:45:00;20-30 seconds;Bright light moving across sky at very fast speed & very high alttitude I had just walked outside to find my wife. She was sitting on the driveway & admiring the night sky. I had just sat down with her & looked up. Whne I did I saw a bright light almost directly overhead but it was moving at a very fast speed. I said to my wife look at that light it us really moving quickly. Since it was dark out it was difficult to determine its altittude but I would say it was extremely high up (maybe 50,000 ft or so). It traveled almost in a straight line moving west to east-southeast. The light was steady & did not flash as an airplane would. There wasn't any noise accompanying the movement. The sighting lasted approx. 20-30 seconds & the light dis-appeared as it moved towards the horizon/tree line of my neighborhood. My wife & I have seen many airplanes in our lifetime, but I can assure you that this was not any plane I have ever seen.. Maybe some type of secret millitary craft.. but certainly not a commercial craft..;37.7079704081633;-89.208187755102
Comet-like white orb of light abruptly stops in the sky and slowly hovers around the skies south of Carbondale.;2014-11-21 04:50:00;1 hour;Comet-like white orb of light abruptly stops in the sky and slowly hovers around the skies south of Carbondale. This morning (11/21/14), I was lying in bed and through the blinds I thought I saw a shooting star falling straight (horizontally) across the sky, south of my apartment.  I got up and looked out of the blinds and realized that this ball of white light was moving too slowly to be a comet.   The orb stopped and made slow movements around in the sky.  It was rising and falling, making circular motions.  Most of its movements were slow, but some were really fast.  I watched it out of my window for over an hour.  Sometimes it hovered and looked just like a bright star in one spot for a while, then it moved to the left or right across the sky and then it stopped again.   Sometimes when the orb turned I thought I saw some red and green light, but it was mostly bright white light that I could see.   I tried to take a cell phone video of the UFO, but I couldnâ€™t get a good shot of it because it was pretty far up in the sky. When it was getting close to 6:00 a.m., I looked out my window again and it was finally gone.  It should be noted that I saw a similar UFO a few years ago above Harrisburg, IL.  - A 3L Law Student at SIU;37.7079704081633;-89.208187755102
2 big, white lights hovering over Carbondale, and 5 helicopters circling around them.;2015-03-19 20:15:00;30 minutes;2 big, white lights hovering over Carbondale, and 5 helicopters circling around them. I was driving north from Makanda to Carbondale at 8:15 pm.  About a mile north of the south end of Union Hill, I saw some lights in the sky to the north of me.  2 large white lights floating motionless in the sky, and some smaller colored lights that appeared to be helicopters. The white lights were, from my vantage, about 5 degrees above the horizon.  Apparently floating 500' above Hwy 13, or somewhere to the north of Hwy 13.  The light on the left was floating about 200' higher than they one on the right (This is a very rough estimate).  They were bright, big, glowing, white. The helicopters were moving to the left and right, back and forth, maybe circling.  2 were flying around near the SIU farms, west of McLafferty and South of Chataqua.  The other 3 were roving around in the vicinity of the 2 white lights. I was driving into Carbondale to visit a friend.  From his house I could see the white lights and 1 helicopter.   I went inside his house for 2 minutes and dragged him outside to see.  He saw the helicopter.  The Light seemed to have moved a bit when I saw it again, it had drifted a little lower, partially hidden by trees and buildings. I went inside.  Came back out 15 minutes later.  No sign of lights or helicopters. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Yes, April.  (sic.  March 19, 2015) Just learned that they local small airport was holding night-flying training that night. Which doesn't explain the 2 white lights but I dunno, maybe they were some kind of markers. I'm feeling like my report may have been a false alarm. Sure was spooky tho.
