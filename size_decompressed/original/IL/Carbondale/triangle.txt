The object was traveling N to NW above the tree line.  It was triangular shaped with semi-circles at each point of the triangle.  The objects color was silver.  The tecture of the mechanical object seemed to be similar to a brushed aluminum.  I was about 20 to 30 feet from it at my eye level on the 7th floor of the apartment building that I live in.  It seemed to be about 3to 5 feet across at the bottom. It caught my eye outside my patio so I went to investigate.  I stood there and watched it travel (like it was floating) horizontally right in front of me.  When it noticed me the  flat side of the pyramid rotated on its axis and faced me.  I remember a flash of light that came from the center of the object.  I watched it pick up speed and travel N.  At this point I went inside to tell someone to step outside and look at this thing in the sky.  He came out and it was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this individual, and he sounded to us to be quite objective and credible.  We have encouraged the witness to try to locate other potential witnesses in the area, who may have observed the same object.  PD));37.7079704081633;-89.208187755102
Apparent fixed wing aircraft flying at a few thousand feet making no noise.;2006-10-18 22:00:00;15 seconds;Apparent fixed wing aircraft flying at a few thousand feet making no noise. I was outside my place talking with my mother when I looked up and saw the outline of an aircraft somewhat in the shape of a triange.  Basically, it was a triangle with no base, just the sides, much like a fixed wing aircraft.   These sides had dim white lights which were symmetrical on both sides of the quasi triangle.  I would say there were 20 lights, 10 on each side, on the aircraft.   I couldn't make out the actual body of the aircraft, so there is the possibility it was several aircraft traveling in tandum.  The general shape reminded me of the F-117 stealth aircraft except there were no blinkers on the craft or other lights of any kind other than the aforementioned.   I waited several minutes expecting a sonic boom or other loud noise, there was absolutely no noise.  I would say the object(s) was traveling at an altitude of 2-3000 feet, that would be my best guess.   I only wish I had a camera or video recorder with me.;37.7079704081633;-89.208187755102
Triangular object moving at an extremely slow speed covered the starlit sky as it flew across local neighborhood;2007-06-11 01:00:00;15 seconds;Triangular object moving at an extremely slow speed covered the starlit sky as it flew across local neighborhood Around June 11th 2007  It was around 1:00 a.m. sitting outside with my friends when I was looking up into the sky to observe the stars. I was trying to find the big dipper, when I noticed that there were two stars, that didn’t quite fit in. It was only a fraction of a second before the two unidentifiable stars were in motion. When I noticed that there were two stars that were moving, I thought that perhaps hallucinating because I was tired from being up so late. I studied the objects in motion for a brief moment when I realized that there was a third star not too far ahead of the two, also in motion. The two stars were moving at the same speed, in the same direction. The third star (in front of the two) was also moving at the same speed, in the same direction.  I told my 3 friends who were out there with me to take a look and pointed them in the direction, and they were just as amazed as I when we realized that as the “stars” were moving through the sky, that the actual stars in the sky, disappeared, and the reappeared after the moving “stars” had passed.  When placing an imaginary line to get a shape of the moving “stars”, you were looking at a triangle. The triangle was enormous. It was moving at an extremely slow speed, and was obviously a solid object, because as previously stated, the actual stars in the sky, disappeared as the object flew over the night sky.  My friend insisted that there was some army-base near by and that it was an aircraft. I had to disagree because the object was larger than any aircraft we have in the area, and said that its 1 o’clock in the morning, and that there are no army-bases testing aircrafts in the local neighborhoods in the middle of the night! Also, aircrafts give off three different colored flashing lights one red, one blue and one clear (bright). Aircrafts don’t fly in sync unless doing a performance, which we don’t have in this area. Aircrafts also don’t fly in the same direction for more than a few seconds until they fall out of line because they are going to different places.  The object took about 10 seconds to be out of sight, but that was only because it flew so far into the distance, and we weren’t able to see past the surrounding area. The direction it flew was NNE, towards some of the back roads. (There is an airbase located in the area, however the object was larger than the base itself.)  Using google earth, I am able give you enough information to get a visual of how large the object was.  If you can get yourself to  Pointer    37°46’32.34” N    89°15.05.45” W elev. 397ft streaming 100%  eye alt 4455ft.  This will give you an image of the airbase. The object seen in the sky, was big enough to cover 2 of them. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));37.7079704081633;-89.208187755102
