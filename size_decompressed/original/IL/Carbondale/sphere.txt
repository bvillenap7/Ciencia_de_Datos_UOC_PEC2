It just appeared, then took off in a northeast direction very quickly. I almost didn't report this because I was the only one who saw it, but I told my boyfriend, who is fairly well educated in this area, and he sent me a link to your page.  I saw the picture of the sighting in CA and decided that it was similar enough that I'd send you a report.  THe differences between this and that report are the direction it traveled and the one I saw was not as green, just a green haze around it.  I have always believed that people do see them, but I have never had an experience until now.  I hope there were others in the area who saw this too.;37.7079704081633;-89.208187755102
