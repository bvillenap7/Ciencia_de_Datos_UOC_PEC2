Seen shiny aluminum colored craft @ Yeager Lake in Litchfield;2007-10-01 13:00:00;a few seconds;Seen shiny aluminum colored craft @ Yeager Lake in Litchfield One afternoon while taking an afternoon ride out by Litchfieldâ€™s Lake Lou Yeager I was heading west on Beach House Trail road when I notice something shiny like aluminum in a gap between two trees.  I only got to see it for about 3 seconds 4 tops.  I sped up to see if I could get a good look at it but it was gone no where to be found.  The object was moving back to the northeast towards the lake.  I know I seen something even if it was for a few seconds. It was odd to me by how it seem to just float by not real fast, just like real smooth. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));39.1733;-89.6404000000001
