IT WAS APPROXIMATELY 9:10 WHEN I WAS DOING MY HOMEWORK AND I SAW A BRIGHT FLASH.  I LOOKED OUT MY WINDOW NEXT TO MY DESK AND SAW 2 BRIGHT LIGHTS SUSPENDED IN THE AIR ABOUT 100 FEET UP.  THEY WERE GLARING AWKWARDLY, I THOUGHT NOTHING OF IT AND GOT BACK TO DOING MY HOMEWORK ABOUT 5 MINUTES LATER I BEGAN TO HEAR A MOTOR TYPE SOUND. ( KINDA LIKE A LAWNMOWER) THIS WENT ON FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER TEN MINUTES. I REALIZED THAT THE SOUND WAS GENERATED FROM THE GLARING LIGHTS IN THE SKY OUTSIDE MY WINDOW.  AT THAT POINT I BEGAN TO THINK IT WAS SOMESORT OF UFO. I MEAN I DIDN'T REALLY BELIEVE IN THEM UNTILL THEN. THE BRIGHT LIGHTS BEGAN TO SHIMMER A BIT AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN BOLTED AWAY. I FELT A SENSE OF PRESENSE LIKE I NEVER HAVE BEFORE. AT THAT POINT AND TIME I REALIZED THAT I HAD ENCOUNTERED SOMETHING SUPERNATURAL, SOMETHING SOO UNBELIEVABLY DIFFERENT THAT I COULDNT SLEEP THE WHOLE REST OF THE NIGHT. I TRIED TELLIN MY PARENTS BUT THEY THOUGHT I WAS CRAZY AND TOLD ME THAT IT WAS PROBABLY JUST STARS BUT I DIDN'T BELIEVE THEM......SINCE THEN I HAVE BEEN WATCHING OUT MY WINDOW FOR THEM BUT I HAVENT ENCOUNTERED THEM AGAIN.;41.8738;-87.9668000000001
I believe I was abducted by Aliens;2006-07-16 22:00:00;23 minutes;I believe I was abducted by Aliens After walking home from the video store just after dropping off a rented video. I was walking accross Lions park, it is a public park with two softball fields and a playground to the south of the fields. I entered the field heading south accross the park towards my house. the field is about 200 sqaure yards roughly. I decided to sit down at a bench to answer my cell phone. after the call, I looked to the sky, and I saw a bright yellow light, It had come closer and closer until it slid out of clear view behind a tree. The light turned blue, the next thing I remember is waking up 23 minutes later in the middle of the field with a brown blister on the back of my hand inbetween my index finger knuckle and my thumb. I woke up about 30 yards from where i was sitting at the bench. Before I had become unconcious I had taken a picture of the light. Although it was the camera on my phone and its a real poor shot. You can see the yellow light behind the tree. Where the yellow light is, there is no street light or any lamp. I have also taken a picture of the blister after it had popped. Plus after I had regained conciousness I had a slight stomache ache but it wore off soon ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.
