Dim orange orb.;2016-11-06 20:35:00;5 seconds;dim orange orb Clear evening. Looking at an airplane light (small, red) in sky to south/southwest.  Suddenly saw orange orb travel from south to north.  It was not glowing, but was barely visible, and seemed to shad darker at the top.  Height unknown. Size comparison: the airplane light would fit 20 to 30 times into the comparative size of the orb.  There was no sound, and it's movement was straight and extremely fast.  It was a bit hard to see, but it sped faster than my head could turn.  No chance of it being a reflection in my glasses, by the way it sped ahead of my turning head.;41.8738;-87.9668000000001
