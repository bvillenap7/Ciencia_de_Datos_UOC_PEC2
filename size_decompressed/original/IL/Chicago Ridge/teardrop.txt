Playing with Dog in yard.  Dog suddenly looked up in as if following something moving quickly.  Already facing SW I see this light (completely white) as bright as a star rapidly and silently traveling NW to SE.  The forward part shaped like a half sphere and the trailing end almost cone shaped.  Not like a meteror where trailing end is like a tail.  This seemed like a complete shape sort of like a teardrop. I live by Midway airport and any aircraft landing is so close you can read the markings on it.  This was not an aircraft in any sense, made no sound and traveling more at the speed of a missle and not in any flight pattern aircraft in region would make.  It disaappeared into a cloud which was actually far below a commerical plane traveling east to west.  It never emerged from the other side of the cloud.;41.7067;-87.7755
