Airplane looking orange fireball, like a plane going down.;2009-06-06 09:15:00;1 minute;Airplane looking orange fireball, like a plane going down. I had stepped out on the patio in my yard and seen what I thought was an aircraft approaching for landing at Midway.  It was decending in the distance.  It was orange in color. As it was supposed to come closer it rose in elevation and appeared to make the normal turn towards our house.  It then dropped out of the sky like a fireball.  I am awaiting bad news on the television.  I hope it was not an aircraft. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));41.7067;-87.7755
