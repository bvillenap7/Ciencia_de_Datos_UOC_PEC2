Object flashed overhead, bright blue/green;1997-07-04 21:25:00;2 seconds;Summary : Object flashed overhead, bright blue/green We were watching the fireworks in a boat on East Fork Lake just outside of Olney, IL.  A unidentified object went overhead.  It was blue/green and looked very close to be from outer space but too far up to be fireworks.  It was in sight about 2 seconds and then disappeared on the other side of the trees along the lake.;38.7369;-88.0793
Orb down the road.;2012-05-28 04:30:00;2 hours;Orb down the road. I was seeing moving objects across the sky for 5 nights prior.  Finally decide to go out in the middle of the country by myself, and noticed an orange orb in my rear view mirror.  I assumed it was a field light, but the orb never left my sight for over an hour of driving around.  I finally parked and sat on my trunk and watched it watch me.  After about an hour of it sitting there, it was starting to turn day light.  Then it gets really bright so I decide to take a picture so someone else can see what I was seeing.  I managed to get two pictures with my camera phone, not blurred, was not streaked so it was not a moving object, and next thing I know it was gone.  I just would like to hear a response to these pictures because I cannot think of anything but a u.f.o that would cause this image.  The sun was not over the horizon yet, and no car would cause such a orb light. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));38.7369;-88.0793
