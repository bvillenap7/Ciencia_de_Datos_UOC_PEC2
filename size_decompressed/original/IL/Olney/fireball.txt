Odd fireball like object in Olney, IL.;2015-09-21 20:10:00;1 minute;Odd fireball like object in Olney, IL. As I stepped out for a cigarette, I noticed a curiously bright fireball like object ascending vertically in the air about 300 yards away.  The fireball then smoothly changed its trajectory into more of a horizontal course.  This struck me as particularly odd because of the light intensity, (vibrant, bright, and pulsing red/orange/yellow light) the trajectory, (flawlessly executed and smooth) and location (it ascended from a woodsy cornfield area).    There was no police and/or medical unit activity reported during that time.  It was absolutely beautiful, but very odd at the same time.  There wasn't any sign of smoke, burning debris, or exhaust.  The object didn't emit a sound and was completely silent.;38.7369;-88.0793
