On October 19th, 2015, at approximately 7:45 PM, I observed a glowing orange object, circular to oval in shape, moving south to north in the sky for approximately one minute, until it disappeared.  It appeared to be flying at an altitude of 3000 AGL.  There was no sound, no exhaust trail of any kind and it was moving quite fast without any navigation lights observed.  I am a retired pilot, and this did not appear to be an airplane or helicopter of any kind.   This incident occurred just slightly west of Musgrove Park in Olney, IL.
