Red Trinagle over chillicothe illinois woods;2011-08-12 21:45:00;10 minutes;Red Trinagle over chillicothe illinois woods I was standing on my porch having a phone conversation looking into the sky,  I was a bright red object.  I have seen many airplanes and it wasn't anything like that. The light was so bright it was like somebody shining a laser pointer into my eyes. I observed for about 10 minutes, it was moving faster then any aircraft i've seen.  All of  a sudden it stopped dead in the air i looked down at my phone in disbelief to tell my friend and it disappeared when i looked up.  I have a wide up backyard and there's no way it could have possibly covered enough ground to be out of my field of vision.;40.9013;-89.5068
