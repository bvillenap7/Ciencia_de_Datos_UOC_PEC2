AS i was driving home, I had noticed a bright orange light in the sky...at first i blew it off as a planet or star.  Then, i noticed 6 of them total and they were just hovering over. then, one by one, they disappeared into the night sky.  i have never seen anything like this before!;40.9013;-89.5068
