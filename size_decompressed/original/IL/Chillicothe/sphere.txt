Heading North on Rte 29 towards Henry Il.  I, my son and his friend were returning from a movie in the local town.  The road is paved two way traffic...55 mph with no street lights. Somewhat mountainous for Illinois the road is situated between the hill to the west and the Illinois River to the East. There was no oncoming traffic, street lights or house lights sky was overcast so the only illumination was the car lights. As we headed into the darkest area of the road I noticed three distinct orange globes moving very slow in a triangular shape.  They were heading East with an undetermined speed. I remarked to my passengers to look out the moon roof and windows and they saw the same thing. We watched for about a minute and then they disappeared into the clouds. I want to note we also turned down the inside lighting of the vehicle to get a better view. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
