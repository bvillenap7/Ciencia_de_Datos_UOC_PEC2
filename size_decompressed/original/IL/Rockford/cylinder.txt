Long black tube seen in Rockford IL;2010-05-28 09:10:00;7 minutes;Long black tube seen in Rockford, IL My 7 year old daughter was the first to see it in the car on the way to school.  My 5 year old son was the next to see it.  Daughter called it to the attention of my wife.  She (wife) called me on my cell phone. I was in the garden.  I went to my apartment on the third floor and saw it out the window with binoculars.  It was a long black tube with a small protrusion at one end at a 90 degree angle respective to the body.  Wife said it had a long split running the full length of the body that was slightly lighter than the surrounding body's black color.  I could not see that from my location.  It was 1/2 mile from me and about 400 feet off the ground. Wife saw it from 9:10 to 9:15 when she had to make a turn to get the kids to school.  I saw it from 9:13 to 9:17 when it disappeared.  I didn't see the direction but it was definitely gone from the sky.  Wife said it kept coming closer then going farther away.  It was completely vertical to 10 degrees when she saw it.  It was 45 to 90 degrees slowly varying when I saw it.  It was coming closer to me when it disappeared.;42.2735770992367;-89.0522496183207
