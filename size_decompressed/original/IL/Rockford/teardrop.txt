Was downtown waiting for fireworks when I noticed a dark red light in the sky moving really slow...   I thought maybe it was a helicopter but there was no flashing light or any other light source...  It then faded out and you could see the object just sitting there for 15 minutes until it just disappeared...  Note there where other helicopters in the area with flashing lights and landing lights on...;42.2735770992367;-89.0522496183207
