I ((deleted)) accompanied with wife ((deleted)), and sixteen year old son ((deleted)), and five year old daughter ((deleted)) were on states street in rockford illinois approximately 9:15 p.m. heading east in a heavily populated area when we all noticed Five Large orange glowing lights Flying in unusual formation. Suprised by this, we immediately pulled off the road and My son just so happened to have his 8mm videocamcorder with him, and he jumped out the vehicle along side the road and began video taping this flying objects for about 10-15 minutes.  My wife and I sat in the car with our windows down and intently watched as these objects not only flew in intelligent formation but at times changed formation as follows:  First..  They were flying staggered vertically..  Then two of the lower ones flew directly along side each other.. almost touching each other.  Immediately after that, One of those objects flew below the other then in a counterclockwise rotation.. arced up and around the other object, then resumed position again along side it.. shortly after this four of the objects began flying in a straight line vertically one over the top of the other flying east to west.. almost seemed to be hovvering at a slow speed.. so it seemed.  The highest object which will call the fifth object appeared to always stay a little bit ahead of the rest of the objects below it.. almost as if It was the lead object, and always stayed to the left of the objects.  After the lower objects flew a couple of arial acrobatic moves , the next too above them also made a few arial moves then the lower objects appeared to one by one rapidly speed away till they disappeared..  From the bottom one by one..  While they're was still three of the objects visible the very top object none as the fifth object or the lead object either seperated into two objects or actually appeared to have dropped another object out the bottom of it.  We observed this for a few seconds.. and then systematically one by one the appeared to speed away until no! n visibl e.. At that time we could no longer see anymore objects.  We came home and the first thing I did was call the rockford airport because these objects appeared to be almost directly over the airport vacinity. The airport me in direct contact with the control tower, I told the conrtol tower that we had seen some  u.f.o.'s and wondered if anyone else had reported anystrange objects, He said a few people had called in.  I told them what we saw and asked him if they had any aircraft around that time on radar flying in formation like that..  He said absolutely not, he suggested we contact National UFO Reporting Center which we did.. and we also contacted a few local news agencies.. and also were told by these sources that other people were calling in and reporting similiar stories.. ((NUFORC Note:  The event was reported on the 10:00 p.m. newscast by WRAX-TV.  Please see reports of somewhat similar sighting events in Prescott, AZ, during the first week of February 2000.));42.2735770992367;-89.0522496183207

The other 2 were lower and to the left, almost like they were observing manuevers. I was driving west at about 20 MPH and noticed 5 orangish fireball-like objects in the sky.  It appeared they were at an alttitude comparable to what a small plane would fly at. Three of the objects were in an triangular formation,they rotated postions,and circled around the other two and fell back into position.  The other 2 objects stayed to the lower left of the triangle,like they were observing.  The 3 objects movements reminded me of watching a group like the Blue Angels perform, it just seemed to be practiced, like a routine.  I had stopped the car and watched all of this occur, this happened in about 5 minutes.   I then drove about a quarter of a mile, parked my car and got out, and watched them again.  They acted in the same manner as stated before. I entered a store when I exited 30 minutes later the objects were gone.  Besides myself,my wife, mother and grandmother all witnessed this occurance.;42.2735770992367;-89.0522496183207

State street and looked up along with several people to see several fireballs forming formations in the Eastern sky.  We instantly thought they were UFO's.  Several other people in different locations in the city saw similar objects and formations.  Interesting, prior to the sightings a friend of mine saw a NASA van in the city earlier that morning.  In addition, Rockford IL is known for its aeronautical enginering.;42.2735770992367;-89.0522496183207
My Wife and I noticed 9 Redish Orange Lights floating west to east;2001-01-11 21:30:00;10 minutes;My Wife and I noticed 9 Redish Orange Lights floating west to east My Wife and I noticed 9 Redish Orange Lights floating west to east over the state street area in Rockford about 21:25 on 01/11/01. They appeared to circle around each other as they floated along. They also gained height as they floated eastward. We live near state and I90 and the lights disappeared into the clouds just above our house. They floated like ballons, but the lights were very bright. If they were ballons, they must have been tied together because of the way they circled each other. The sky filled with clouds. The cloud cover was low as well. The Rockford news media have video that represent what we saw very well.;42.2735770992367;-89.0522496183207
Eight golden/orange objects hovering above Rockford.;2001-02-10 22:30:00;3 minutes;Eight golden/orange objects hovering above Rockford. The three of us witnessed eight golden/orange fireballs that seemed to be hovering over the city of Rockford.  Looked like stars but brighter.  They seemed to be in some sort of formation, with one a bit of a distance to the left of the others.  All eight gradually faded out.  All could be clearly seen from toll plaza at intersection of Route 20 and Interstate 90.  At least one other car witnessed event.;42.2735770992367;-89.0522496183207
Fireball in the sky around 911, being chased by the military!;2001-09-13 23:00:00;5 Minutes;Fireball in the sky around 911, being chased by the military! I used to work for UPS. After 911 the airport was of course closed for a few days, so I was at home. Many military aircraft were flying all over the country and Rockford Illinois was not left out. Many F-16 style jet fighters could be seen in our skies over those days. Most aircraft fly from west to east or east to west across the Rockford skies, it is very odd to see them fly in any other direction unless they are flying low to land at our very own airport. A few days into the 911 event, I was standing on my front deck and noticed a few lights in the distance to the south flying north. I figured it was military jets scouting our skies. I was half right. As the lights came closer (actually passing over my house to the north)I could see the objects very clearly. The chase plane was a military jet, I believe it was an F-16. The lead craft flying directly in front of teh jet was a ball of fire a little larger than the jet. They flew north until out of my view. Its the closet I have ever been to a real UFO. I hope that you can find sighting reports from others in my area, and possibly the military to substantiate this sighting. I am reporting this now as I this is teh first web site that I have discovered that will allow you to record events like this. Thank You.

Bright glowing object exiting earth's atmosphere w/ object ejmitted from glow at very fast speed;2007-07-21 04:30:00;5 Min;Bright glowing object exiting earth's atmosphere w/ object ejmitted from glow at very fast speed I was up working on a project for work and went outside for a cigarette. I was looking east and saw what I initially thought was an airplane with its flood lights through the branches of the tree located in my front yard, I then thought the plane is pretty low so I walked forward to see clearly what was going on. As I walked toward the light my second thought was the Rockford PD with their new police helicopter are on the hunt for someone with the search lights on, until I came to a clear view and the lights grew intense and then more intense as though a star was expanding glowing brighter and brighter for a few seconds and then from the light it looked as if it was a very large meteor entering the atmosphere catching on fire. I was convinced I was seeing the coolest meteor ever to fall to earth until it hit me, the meteor was not falling to earth it was moving away from earth up through and out of our atmosphere . As soon as I realized it was going the wrong direction for a meteor, a small object too small for great descriptive detail but if I were to give the best discription it was almost like an object with a perfect oval shape tilted on its side horizontally shot from the object that was on fire exiting our atmosphere at an imperceptible speed and seemed to disappear into the starry night sky with the fireball left trailing until disapating to blackness.  I then went and looked at the launch scheduled for NASA to see if it had been the shuttle and found that there were no launches scheduled for July.

Three orange glowing lights traveling together in the form of a verticle triangle in the night disappear into the clouds.;2010-09-04 20:00:00;2 OR 3 MINS;Three orange glowing lights traveling together in the form of a verticle triangle in the night disappear into the clouds. I was driving west down East Street in Rockford, Il with my son. Ahead up in the night sky to our right we saw three round glowing lights. They were moving in a southerly direction. We decided to turn right into a parking lot and get out of the vehicle and look up at them. When we pulled in we were directly under them. They were in a vertical triangle position. Not horizontal. My son kept thinking they were balloons because the glowing lights looked like burning flames that you would see from a hot air baloon. They were low and making no sounds. Rockford does have an airport and we have seen planes often. Planes have red flashing and white lights and make noise. Not these orange passing what ever they were lights passing in the night sky just above our heads! They faded into some clouds and then disappeared. I doubt anyone would be flying in a hot air balloon in the dark.  And three of them at that. And then to be perfectly traveling together in the shape of a perfect triangle.  Too weird. Also, I did witness an air plane near the object.;42.2735770992367;-89.0522496183207
Single orange fireball that moved slowly East to West, stopped and slowly disappeared.;2011-07-04 21:20:00;3 minutes;Single orange fireball that moved slowly East to West, stopped and slowly disappeared. We were sitting on the Chestnut Bridge in Rockford, IL waiting for the fireworks to start on July 4, 2011.  The street lights had just come on (I believe it was around 21:20) when my daughter saw what appeared to be a single orange circular fireball.   She nudged me and asked what it was.  I had no idea.  We watched it travel slowly from East to West, when it stopped moving and the light slowly faded and disappeared.  There was no sound emitted from the object.   We saw several people in the crowd look up at it, but no one offered any explanations. I saw something that looked exactly the same on Saturday, July 2, on the lake at Apple Canyon, IL, waiting for their fireworks to begin which was also around 21:20.  It had the same shape and color (circular and orange)and there was only 1.  It moved slowly West to East.   I watched it for a minute when I got distracted by someone and averted my eyes for only a moment.  When I went to watch it some more, the object was gone. I am not one of those people who believe in UFO’s, but thus far, no one has offered a reasonable explanation as to what the object was.

While socializing, I saw what I thought to be a really slow moving shooting star out of the corner of my eye. I said aloud to everyone there hey, I think I saw a shooting star! I didn't think about the fact that it was very cloudy out (and I was unable to see any stars when I looked up) but I saw this in my peripheral vision and wrote it off as a really bright shooting star.   About ten to fifteen minutes later, my brother and I were having a conversation about UFO's, strangely enough.  He was telling me how he saw a UFO while at work the previous day.  My brother is really into UFO's and has been talking about them a lot recently. I said to him yeah, yeah, real cool. I'll believe it when I see it with my own eyes. Literally five seconds later I saw a strange light move around from where the other shooting light had come from and I said whoa which made my brother look! up in the same direction as I was.  Above my friend's house and just below the clouds, we both saw a large yellowish orange concentrated ball make itself visible and move at a steady pace at about a 100 degree angle across the sky.  It was going much faster than an airplane and much slower than a shooting star. It was one solid light, not many small ones.  It was completely silent. When it got to the end of that stretch it disappeared into thin air.  It moved at an upward angle, but not straight up.   We both saw the whole thing and can't figure out what it could have been.  I have never seen anything like that before. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));42.2735770992367;-89.0522496183207

Eight globes like if they were full of fire inescapable from the  bright globe flew silently over Rockford, IL.;2013-05-12 22:30:00;15 minutes;Eight globes like if they were full of fire inescapable from the  bright globe flew silently over Rockford, IL. On the date 05/12/13 at about 22:30 and 22:45 I was outside my house in the dark, since our street is one of the street in the city of Rockford,IL. that has the street lights shut off.I was making sure that my car was locked before going in the house,When I noticed a light moving slowly,silently in the dark sky toward my direction,It looked like a circle with what it seemed to be a bright red and bright yellow, like a fire contained with in the circle,  There was no blinking,just a bright red mixture of fire like mixture all contained with in the circle,there was no smoke,no sound,just a slow moving object at a very low altitude {about a 3/4 of a mile high},As I was observing this craft move and pass almost over me,I situated myself as close to the house wall as possible as to pretend to be part of the house,not moving.As the first craft was gliding over me at the described altitude ,I noticed a second craft also coming from the same direction{from the West m! oving East},  The separating distance from the first craft I calculate to be about 4 city blocks,This craft was also identical in description{If you have seen in you tube a video of the functioning sun and all the hot colors,That is exactly how these crafts looked inside that circle},  The speed of the second craft was similar to the one of the first craft,As the second craft was passing over us{same altitude},I noticed 2 crafts coming from the same direction about 4 city blocks separating distance,These 2 crafts were flying side by side{somewhat close to each other}.  Needless to say by now I was very scared,and planning to get myself into the house asap.I went into the house and told my wife what I saw and ask her to come to the front porch of the house,By this time there were two more crafts coming from the same direction at somewhat faster pace{still I feel that it was slow speed for a UFO}but I felt that these two crafts were in a little faster pace , perhaps trying to catch! up  to the first four crafts.My wife saw these two crafts and! she als o could not figure out what  they were{We are absolutely sure that they were not airplane,helicopters or anything man made.as  me and my wife were looking at the two crafts,I noticed 2 more crafts coming from the same direction in the distance{4 city blocks}By now I called my next door neighbor and told him to come out and see what was going on outside,He came out and had a cell phone{Iphone5}and was able to still catch  some seconds of video of the crafts as they seemed to gather high in the Eastern sky.  Also outside was my neighbor`s grand daughter{15 years old},We have the video: https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=10200812612894311&set=vb.1133124242&type=2&theater   I would like to put emphasis on the size of the globes that I saw,They were all the same in size and color,There were no sounds,Low altitude as if they were taking a deeper and closer look at the Earth, I have a son that is a police officer ,He said that there were no calls from people reporting seeing this cr! afts.Also the Chicago-Rockford International Airport{In Rockford,IL}is located about one mile away from the location where this sighting occurred, I do not know if they detected anything that night. These crafts definitely were fallowing a route,had organized spacing,control in the speed of movement,formation and synchronization.;42.2735770992367;-89.0522496183207
