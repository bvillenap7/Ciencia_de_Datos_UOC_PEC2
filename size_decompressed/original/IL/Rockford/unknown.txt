I was walking East towards home and I saw a bright meteor flash above me heading from West to East. I merely thought I had seen a brilliant meteor. A week later while taking my walk and almost at the same time I again saw a brilliant meteor heading again West to East about the same brightness as the previous one. I thought how unusual to see two in about a week. About a week and a half later I didn't take my usual walk and was sitting in the living room and glanced out my picture window which faced East, and again saw a brilliant meteoric flash leaving a long trail and dissappearing over the roof of some distant houses. All three meteors were of similar intensity in brilliance which I thought very unusual. Especially to see 3 the same month and all were traveling West to East. ((NUFORC Note:  It is not unusual for three meteors to be seen in the same area over such a short period of time, but it is unusual for meteors to fly from west to east.  We do not know what the witness observed.  Note that several similar meteors have been seen in Washington State during the same time period.  PD));42.2735770992367;-89.0522496183207

I went outside about 4:30 am.  I looked up to observe the stars.  I noticed the big dipper and looked for the north star.  What I thought was the north star seemed to have flashing red and blue lights.  I thought it could have been an airplane (I do live near an airport). but it seemed to just hoover.  It moved from side to side, hid be hind trees, then started to fly away, but then again just hoovered.  I could see the lights but being as dark as it was could not make out shape or size.  There seemed to be 2 or 3 airplanes chasing after it.  I could tell they were planes from there light patterns.;42.2735770992367;-89.0522496183207
