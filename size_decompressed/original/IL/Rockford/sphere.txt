Huge Orange Shaped sphere hovering about the ground about 3 feet.;1987-04-22 23:30:00;15 Mins;Huge Orange Shaped sphere hovering about the ground about 3 feet. Every night I use to drive my girlfriend home using the same path.  Harrison to S. Main, S.Main to olgeby road.  Down this road to Peripont to auburn to her house. I made this trip almost every night for about 4 years. On Olgeby road there are a few house, and a Large Milk plant, most of the houses are farm houses and are surrounded by corn fields.  It was Early spring so th fields were just soil. I had made the trip to her house, dropped her off, and was on my way back home same path back just in reverse, I turned onto olgeby road and started to head down it, thise road is only about 2 miles long before it hit's S.Main.  It has so small hills heading up east and would be heading downward west.  So the road was higher in places, well as I topped the largest hill, I slammed on my breaks, because to the right of me about 35 feet tall there was this HUGE and I mean Huge Orange sphere hovering above the ground over the empty cornfield.  I stood there gazing at it out my passenger window.  I wasn't really scared just shocked that there it was just hovering there, there was no sound, and the light from it was lighting up about 50 feet around it.  I finally stepped out my car and began to look over the top of the car at it.  He just sat there, I watched it for a good 15 mins before I became spooked and felt like getting out of there.  My Brother lived about a mile down the street off of S.Main so i drove like a bat out of hell, got him in the car we went back and the object was gone.  I would estimate it's size to be from 60 to 70 feet tall, and least 120 foot round.  It wasn't smooth it had what looked like panels, but the seams couldn't be seen. Couple days later my brother called me and told me he had seen what i discribed floating over the river while crossing the harrison streey bridge. Just for the record i didn't experience any time loss, or haven't had any physical side affects from this. I also seen those large Orange balls in the sky back in Feb.  And you know what, if you asked me i'd say they were the same thing.  Just tonight I remembered seeing that object that night because of the recent sightings here in Rockford, I think they are connected, and I don't care what officals say about it. People ask me why I am saying something about it now? Well because back then i was a teenager, and besides my brother. My mom, girlfriend, and friends say i was making it up. I am older now, and i know for a fact it was real, and i know what i encountered.;42.2735770992367;-89.0522496183207

As it was moving away from us  it wasn't as bright as it was at first.  As it was going away from us there was a point it seemed to of stopped so my wife got in the car and we went down the road kind of watching it till we couldn't see it anymore. On Feburary 12th, 2000 my wife and i were dining at a local restarant, upon leaving the resturant we heard a female say there was a UFO one of the men with her said No, it's a meteor.  The other man with them stated it was a satilite, then they contiued on to their car.  The sky had a slight over cast and it had begun to snow.My wife and i stood watching.   My wife decided to get the car,  i stood and watched it travel in a westward fashion, then turning and gaining altitude heading in a northwestern direction.  It seem to hover for a few mintues.   My wife and i followed in the car for approximitly 3 to 4 miles.  Then it seemed to disappear, we were not sure if it gone into the cloud cover or just disappeared.   The brightness of the object had a very bright orange glow to it.  We could not judge the distance the object may have been in the sky, but seem to be under the clouds.;42.2735770992367;-89.0522496183207
5 objects in formation, disappeared, 4 more appeared in different formation;2000-02-16 22:15:00;15-20 minutes;5 objects in formation, disappeared, 4 more appeared in different formation Coming home from church meeting.  Approaching State Street & Mulford.  5  Spherical shapped objects were overhead flying from Northwest to Southeast in a set formation.  The objects appeared to be 1/5th the size of the nearly-full moon.  Unable to estimate actual size without knowledge of altitude of objects. The formation changed from time to time.  2 of the objects seemed to nearly touch and then darted apart.  Arriving home we alerted neighbors who joined to watch the 5 original objects disappear one and two at a time and then 4 new objects appeared and flew nearly the same path.  These held formation closer than the first 5.  Among the observers was a  fireman/paramedic, an office manager, a graphic artist, a school assistant and a retired manager.;42.2735770992367;-89.0522496183207
24 total golden colored, orbed lights in configurations similar to the big dipper moving slowly from NW to East;2001-01-11 21:00:00;20 minutes;24 total golden colored, orbed lights in configurations similar to the big dipper moving slowly from NW to East Two seperate sets made of one set of 15 golden orbs in a slow moving configuration similar to the big dipper and accompanied ( believe, but other 2 companions did not seem to hear)by a low hum. Objects were moving from the north west to east.  Followed by car appx. 1/2mi, stopped car and watched objects slowly blink out of sight one by one. A second set of 9 identical color and size orbs as the first set following in same path @ appx. same speed. The night sky was clear at beginning of sightings, then begin to fog over slowly. Followed second set of orbs for another 1/2 mile.  People throughout the traveled area were watching the sight, talking on cell phones, stopping along the route to watch, even people on a city bus were looking out of windows at the objects. Observed by 51yrs. church secretary, 59yrs insurance agent and 8yrs, 3rd grade, male student. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke briefly by telephone with this witness.  They were located near Chile's (sp?) Restaurant when they initially witnessed the objects, and were looking slightly north of east as they gazed at the lights.  Then, they drove east approximately one mile along State Street (??) to Perryville Road, where they stopped again, and continued to look at the lights in the eastern sky.

When the orb disappeared, It was like turning off a light... It was no longer visible.;2004-05-07 21:00:00;41:36;When the orb disappeared, It was like turning off a light... It was no longer visible. I also referenced an object in the northwestern sky on this date. I read the report from Durand IL on the listings which reminded me of what  I had observed. As an amature astonomer, I an well versed with where Venus is in the night sky. It does not set in that section of the sky this time of year... Could not be Venus. Conditions were perfect for viewing celestial objects at dusk into dark. What I observed was a large globe or spherical object that appeared to be within the Earths atmosphere.  Definitely not a star.  Orange in color and pulsated from blue to green to red  in that order. When the event was over, the orb was just not there any longer. This object has not been seen in that area of the sky since then.;42.2735770992367;-89.0522496183207

Orange balls of light, one at horizon level, the other at approx 35Â°   Objects would dim and disappear, then light up again.  After roughly 5-6 minutes, they seemed to mimic normal aircraft with flashing lights, then would return to the orange sphere and slowly rise until out of sight.;42.2735770992367;-89.0522496183207
