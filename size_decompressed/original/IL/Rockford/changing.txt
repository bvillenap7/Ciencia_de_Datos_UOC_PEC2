Seen glowing lights that changed shapes,and rotated around each other.;2000-02-16 21:30:00;1 hour;Seen glowing lights that changed shapes,and rotated around each other. Seen 10 glowing orange lights.  First 5, one in the middle and four around it. (like 5 on a dice)Then on the right side of them 5 more in a straight line.  The lights would change shapes, to circles, triangles,then disappear, like there was a light on one side and they were turning around.  They were seen in the eastern sky.  About 9:30pm on 2/16/00.;42.2735770992367;-89.0522496183207

Bright red, white, and orange lights hovering in the western sky.;2013-10-15 19:30:00;20-25 minutes;Bright red, white, and orange lights hovering in the western sky. We were outside around 7:30 (19:30) and in the western sky there was a very bright white light that was thought to be an aircraft at first but it was traveling too slow.  We thought it was an aircraft because we live by an airport.   The object was traveling from west to east, we observed it with binoculars.  I would say it was aproximatly 8 to 10 miles away from us.   We could see white, red, and orange lights on the object.  At one point in time during this event a smaller object came from the top of the original object and hovered above.   The two objects came back together and we continued to observe it for another 5 to 10 minutes.  The object fell below the horizon behind a line of trees and disappeared from our sight.;42.2735770992367;-89.0522496183207
