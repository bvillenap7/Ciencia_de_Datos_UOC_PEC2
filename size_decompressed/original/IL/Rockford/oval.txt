A keen sighting of many in Rockford Illinois-;2010-07-03 21:20:00;Approx. 30 seconds;A keen sighting of many in Rockford Illinois- I was coming down Rockton Avenue from Riverside in Rockford Illinois and its was approximately 915pm on July 3rd and there was fireworks going around, however I noticed directly above to my left (above all firework lines or having ruled out so) I noticed a red-orangeish craft that was flying strong but fairly slow not far above me.   I stopped and looked at it on my bike and after about 30 seconds it it slowly worked itself to not be seen afterward.  I am putting this on here because I have seen previous UFO's before in Rockford and am very keen of things that aren't normal around rockford skies and this was one of those cases.  It's not the first time Ive had intuitive experiences to look up and see quite abnormal things around rockford skies but this was the most recent.   And for validity I put this sighting up as soon as possible, thank you and I hope someone else was keen enough to see it and come forward and rule out fireworks because if you saw it you would! agree that it wasn't.;42.2735770992367;-89.0522496183207
