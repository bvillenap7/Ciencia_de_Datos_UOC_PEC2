Seen an object in the sky that appeared to be an old World War II plane, buy wasn't!;1969-08-15 20:00:00;3 minutes;Seen an object in the sky that appeared to be an old World War II plane, buy wasn't! This event happened long ago, but it is as if it happened just yesterday. I was just fifteen years old at the time. Here is my terrifying experience! My twin brother was in the hospital which was located only a few blocks from my home. My aunt who lived across the street from me at the time wanted me to go with her so that she wouldn't be alone. My aunt was deaf so she didn't feel comfortable going by herself. We arrived at the hospital about 7:15pm. My aunt and I visited my brother for about 1-1/2 hours. At about 8:45pm when the sun was just about down we were on our way back home when all of the sudden something caught my eye in the northern sky. I looked up and saw two huge lights. The object was about 400-500 feet up in the air and as it started to pass over us I notice that it looked like an old World War II airplane. It was not what it appeared to be. First, there was no noise at all. It also seemed to be floating across the sky very slowly. It was NOT a blimp! If this was an airplane I surely would have heard something and if the airplane was flying that low it certainly would be moving much faster then the speed it was moving. When I seen this and realized this object was not what it appeared to be I became so frightened. I have never been so scared in my life before then or since. Anyway, I looked down because I didn't want to see this thing anymore. I grabbed my aunt's hand and tried to run, but she would not run. I couldn't leave her behind so I just held on to her hand tight and held my breath because I just knew we were going to be picked up by this craft. After what seemed forever I looked up and the object was gone. My aunt and I made it home alright and I told my family what happened, but they thought I was just seeing things. As far as my aunt goes, she didn't run because she couldn't hear and what she seen was an airplane to her although she did say that it seemed strange that it was moving so slow. She was also puzzled. After this happened I always closed my curtains in my bedroom and tried to stay inside when dusk came. I always felt that they would come back for me. I know this sounds crazy, but this event did happen. Thank you for letting me share my unforgettable experience with you. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Computer shuts off during light sighting in Rockford;2001-01-11 20:50:00;3 sec;Computer shuts off during light sighting in Rockford I was on the internet at 8:50 pm on Jan 11, when my computer mysteriously shut down then turned on again. This shut down coincided with a sighting of lights by many other citizens of Rockford, IL. Later that night on all three of the news stations in my town reports of light sightings were made. The light sightings were simlilar to the lights I saw in Feb 2000. About 8-11 yellow orange lights were seen. Over 600 people reported that they had seen the lights hovering in the sky. The light sightings were made from 8:50 to 9:00 pm in Rockford over East State street in the same location of previous sightings.;42.2735770992367;-89.0522496183207

ball shaped thing hovering at a low altitude that rose straight up and out of site within a minutes;2005-02-22 17:30:00;4-5 minutes;ball shaped thing hovering at a low altitude that rose straight up and out of site within a minutes The sighting happened  at the time and day given while I was on my way home at the end of the work day as a route manager supplying first aid products to industries.  It was mostly a clear evening with some clouds to the east and some moving in from the west in the distance of  the highway I was traveling north bound on.   As I was at about at the 15-20 mile mark south of the town in live in I noticed a weird sight  in the sky on the west side of the highway. I have always been  interested in aircraft and very much in touch with the sky and those things that occupy it.  I had seen the moon hang really low in the sky before in this part of the country and first thought it was weird for it to be out and so low this soon in the evening so I started staring  at it.  It looked like a planet or rock just suspended  in the sky and as I stared ,it appeared to begin moving upward and just when I started thinking it could be the moon rising or something of a rational reason it rotated and a reflection of light from the setting sun bounced off of what appeared to be a bronze window or panel part of it.   I kept staring at it and trying to keep my vehicle in my lane while watching this thing as long as I can and every time I looked at the road in front of me and return my attention back to where it was just a few seconds ago, I had to find it again because it had moved higher each time.   I was excited and also trying to reason as to why it would be hear and then I realized that it was directly east of the nuclear power plant that was about 10-15 miles west of me and the highway I was on. It was as though the plant was being observed. It rose up without a sound vapor trail or anything and within a minute or so it was completely out of sight, straight up.;42.2735770992367;-89.0522496183207

Very large object glides across opening in clouds for a brief view.;2011-06-24 11:45:00;2-3 seconds;very large object glides across opening in clouds for a brief view. I was on lunch break at work looking at the birds flying around on a very cloudy day.  There was only one break in the clouds in the shape like an open eye. I noticed a huge object seem to float across this opening in the cloudy sky.  This object was at least five times bigger then any aircraft I have ever seen.  The shape was unlike any ufo I ever heard of.  It had a top,middle and bottom to it.  All the same width with the middle a bit larger in highth then the top and bottom.  The top and bottom were the same sizes. middle section was like the saucer shapes you here of, but there were like half saucers on top and bottom of it.  Seemed flat on top and bottom. It just glided through the opening in the clouds for a few seconds and that was it. seemed to be made of medal, not shinny though just a dull look to it.  No lights, no sounds, no signs of combustion. just glided like it was sliding on the gravy some how. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
