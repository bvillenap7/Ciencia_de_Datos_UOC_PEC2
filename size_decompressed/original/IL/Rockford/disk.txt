Saucer shaped about twice the size of a quarter held at arms length about 2 miles distant.  Rotating  windows from left to right.  Saucer was wobbling very slowly for about 5 minutes.  About 20 windows observable.  Looking at object to west.  Reported to Pecatonica state police about 1 hour later and laughed at.  Reported to J.A. Hynek NW University next dawith drawing sent in later.  I have had my son approximate these drawings with computer graphics.  It finally stabilized and floated away to the NW toward Pecatonica.  Only  a white blinking light remained after window lights were shut off.  Light appeared to be center top.  Also, no sound and other witnesses did not seem to be too concerned that they did not what this object was.  The wife and I know! Background will mildly rolling with numerous houses and apartments visable.  Object was at time below the horizon in a slight valley just to the west of the Bel-ford theater on IL RT 20 which runs between Rockford and Belvidere.  This object was extremely large and seemed massive-heavy but suspended in the air and wobbling slowly like when you spin a frisbee on a string. spin it slowly and then strike one side.  At the time I told Hynek's secretary that I thought that the windows measured about 20' x 70. 20 wide - 70 high.  In retrospect, I underestimated these dimensions.  Probably more like 50 by 300.  At that time John Anderson from Rockford was running for president.  Haven't heard much about him lately. He lost as a third party candidate.   I am 49 years old now but it is still vivid in our memories.  Most people look us strangely when we mention it.  Neither of us have seen anything similar since.  We also called the Rockford Airport the next day and they said they had seen nothing unusual on rader the night before.  They said it was probably an advertising plane pulling a lighted banner.  Yea, right!  I have never seen an ad plane that makes no sound, flying around at midnight with a lighted sign the size of Commisky Park.  I just gave up trying to convince peiople.  I guess it doesn't really matter anyway.  Sooner or later everyone will see these.;42.2735770992367;-89.0522496183207

UFO above E. State Street, Feb. 27, 2002, about 19:00 hrs.;2002-02-27 19:00:00;3 minutes;UFO above E. State Street, Feb. 27, 2002, about 19:00 hrs. My husband and I were at the Office Max Store on E.State St., in Rockford, IL.. When we left the store my husband noticed 1 large disk shaped UFO above E. State and told me to look at it. It was large about 30 feet across, and seemed to be of a dark color that was not highly visable at night. When it listed to the side a bit, we could see underneath it, and there was one large round light in the middle not beaming outward - but just lit. There was no sound from the ship at all, and it disappeared in just a couple of seconds. (we were able to watch it for abour 3 min. before it left. But it disappeared into no where in 2 seconds when it took off.) Did anyone else see this ship? We'll be watching this site for more reports from other people in that area of Rockford, Feb. 27th, 2002.;42.2735770992367;-89.0522496183207

I went to my father-inlaws to cut down a tree. I put a rope in the tree to help pull the tree over then I cut the tree half way through, I then went over to the rope to see if I could pull the tree over, when I looked up there they were 4 round objects going south west at a very slow speed slower then any plane and there was no sound. AS I watched them go over I noticed that the one in front looked different than the other three. Then the very last one moved a little faster and connected or docked with the third one. and together they looked like the leader. the direction they were going would have taken them over or close to the rockford air port at about 10:00 am  I dont know if we were the only ones to see them or not I looked in the rockford     paper the next day but there was nothing said about them. I should have stopped what I was doing and called the air port;42.2735770992367;-89.0522496183207
Burning disc observed over Rockford, IL;2012-05-18 21:30:00;10 seconds;Burning disc observed over Rockford, IL My wife was watching a satellite move across the sky from the West to East while finishing cooking on the grill. We’ve spent many a night satellite watching over the years so it is second nature to peer upwards any chance we get.  She called me outside to see a different object in the sky. It had a definite disc shaped and appeared to be on fire. It was moving from the South to North approximately 90 degrees above horizon at highest point. Color was a very bright orange and it did appear to be on fire. It moved at a constant speed, no wavering, and at a pretty good rate. Sky was clear. Altitude undetermined, but if I had to guess I would say 3,000 to 5,000 feet if not higher. Size of object was about the size of a 737 at that altitude, but again object was disc shaped. I have an aviation background and I immediately looked for but did not see a contrail, no noise, no strobe or recognition lights. No glowing, or trailing debris, or smoke trail like you would ! see with a meteor or boloid. No sign of a balloon attached, like one of those party balloons that are sent aloft via a candle. This was no candle and balloon. Object was way too bright, too big, and moving too fast for wind conditions, which were calm to light out of the South East. It appeared to be on fire because of it’s color and the way it looked around the edges, changing in shape ever so slightly like a flickering flame, but the brightness and intensity were constant throughout the object and never dimmed the entire time in view. Duration of sighting was approximately 7 to 10 seconds. Did not have horizon to horizon view of object due to trees and houses, only about 60 degrees of it’s travel was observable if object indeed went horizon to horizon. I saw a similar object last summer and sent in a report at that time.;42.2735770992367;-89.0522496183207
Large object with many bright lights.;2013-01-03 20:00:00;20:00- 20:01;Large object with many bright lights. On January 3, 2013.  The time was about 8:00 in the evining central time.  There was a large  object with many bright lights in a spherical shape.  The object was steadying still (floating) for about 5 seconds. THe object then start lowering slowly but quickly lowering like it was getting ready to land.  There was only one and it had a spherical shape.  It lowered to tree level and the lights shut off.  I have an opinion that it may have went into the golf course or a large park nearby to land.  AS I got out of the car I heard a dog barking eratically from the golf course and then hurried inside.;42.2735770992367;-89.0522496183207
