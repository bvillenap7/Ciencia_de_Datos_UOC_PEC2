Several round objects in a straight line formation;1979-09-01 22:00:00;20 seconds;Several round objects in a straight line formation The unknown objects in this formation were round dim-orange things, like cooling molten steel, ghostly looking, not transparent though.  There was this somewhat fluttery haze around these objects' paremiters.   Each was the size of if you held a penny out at arms length.  I can't tell you for certain there were 7 objects, but I recall -around- that number.  They were in a straight-line formation, but side-by-side abreast, closeley, not single file.  They were seperate and not lights on something, because you could see the sky inbetween each one.  They came flying directly over me and my friend, coming from West and heading East.  Silent.  They seemed to me, about as high and fast as a sort of low small plane. I was a 19 yrold female HS grad, working manual labor factory miscellaneous and living with parents and siblings at that time.  My friend was a few short years older, female, living with one parent, doing miscellaneous print-shop work.  We were sitting outside across the street from her house, on wooden bleechers in a sports field of a school, and it was dark there.  We had a boom box audio cassette/radio player, and acting generally silly.  The neighborhood was a quiet one with rarely to any criminal behaviour about.  That I knew of. The weather that night was warm but not very warm.  No inclement weather.  I recall the sky mostly clear, the stars mostly visible, for a residential neighborhood of a medium city in 1979.

Saw 5 orange lights in the sky viewed them for awhile they formed the big dipper then dimmed out;2000-02-11 21:00:00;15 minutes;Saw 5 orange lights in the sky viewed them for awhile they formed the big dipper then dimmed out Was driving south on Alpine Road when I happened to look out toward the east and saw five very bright orange lights in the sky.  I knew immediately that they were out of place and were acting in a way that there was no label that I could put on them from previous experiences.  My daughter and I pulled into the parking lot where we were going and to my amazement they formed the big dipper one star short.  Then they started to dissapear one at a time slowly then there was only one left.  I looked in the paper but could find no accounts and it was a full week before accounts began to appear along with someone in So.Belot who has a video tape. A stream seem to come down from one object;42.2735770992367;-89.0522496183207
Formation of 10 yellowish glowing targets (night sighting) drifted SW to NE at 5-10 MPH, 1500' AGL then extinguished one at at time.;2001-01-11 21:00:00;0:20;Formation of 10 yellowish glowing targets (night sighting) drifted SW to NE at 5-10 MPH, 1500' AGL then extinguished one at at time. Submitter/observer is a licensed commercial pilot, 4000+ hours.  Viewed approximately 10 yellowish glowing targets appearing to be small hot air balloons in formation.  Balloons are presumed to be 4' high and 3' in diameter, containing a rag soaked in fuel oil mounted on crosswires in the balloon opening.  Formation moved at 5 to 10 mph (estimated) from SW to NE.  May have been approximately 1500' AGL.  When approximately overhead, light began to extinguish, one at a time which would be consistent with fuel exhaustion. ((NUFORC Note:  We believe witness means 2100 hrs., not 2200 hrs..  We have altered the time here.  PD)) FOLLOW-UP CORRESPONDENCE:   Dear Mr. ((name deleted)) Thank you very much for the excellent report. Could I ask, how did you estimate the altitude, please?  Did you triangulate from two or more Locations?  Also, were there other witnesses with you who saw them?  That is, were you alone at the time, or were there other people standing with you, with whom you were discussing the event at the time?  Do you know what the surface winds, and winds aloft at 3 and 6 were at the time, by any chance? Did you look at the objects with binoculars, by any chance, or with the naked eye only? Finally, how did you establish what the combustible fuel was?  Is that an assumption, or were you able to identify that it was fuel oil? Thanks again for sharing the information with our Center! Cordially, Peter Davenport -- Peter B. Davenport, Director National UFO Reporting Center PO Box 45623 University Station Seattle, WA 98145 director@ufocenter.com http://www.UFOcenter.com Hotline: 206-722-3000 (From 8AM to Midnight Pacific preferred) RESPONSE Gracious, Peter.  I hardly expected to receive a personal reply, particularly so quickly. Well, anyway.  To address your questions. ALTITUDE The altitude was guestimated based on a hypthetical or presumed size of the targets.  In other words a 4' or 3' lighted object at approximately 1500' might appear not as a pinpoint but a larger light point, yet not as large enough to be definable as a vehicle or airship.  I realize size and distance are difficult to estimate, particularly at night when there is nothing to calibrate with.  But if you visualized a very tiny aircraft at a very high pattern altitude that would be consistent with the sighting. OTHER OBSERVERS I was with a group of 20 to 30 people.  Apparently the sighting had been going on for several minutes.  I was called outside to join the group for the last 5 to 8 minutes of the sighting.  At that time all of the points of light became extinguished.  There was much discussion and there has been much subsequent discussion.  The 3 local TV stations are collecting many observations and theories.  The sighting included perhaps 1000 or more people in the area.  There are reports of sightings from outside the local area but it is difficult for me to believe that we are all talking about the same sighting.  Numerous amateur videos exist of this particular sighting so comparison can no doubt be performed.  You may receive other reports your web site was mentioned by one of the TV stations which is why I decided to file this report. WINDS Surface winds were calm.  I'm not sure how to obtain past observations for winds aloft.  You may be able to do that for the date/time that I specified for RFD.  I would expect winds aloft at 3,000 to somewhat correlate with what we appeared to observe, e.g. a movement from SW to NE over a period of several minutes.  Interestingly the RFD airport is located approximately 6 miles SW of the position where this observation occurred.  Direction of movement would have placed the path prior to our sighting somewhere in the vicinity of the airport.  If my theory is correct a possible point of origin would be from rural areas south of the city. BINOCULARS No binoculars or other viewing aids were available.  Sightings were unsupplemented naked eyes. FUEL SOURCE Fuel source is a hypothesis based on color and apparent behavior, e.g. yellow color, reasonably constant intensity with occasional minor flickering.  An observation that may have some significance is that the light or flame of each target appeared to diminish before it died out, one by one much as if whatever might be burning was ultimately consumed.  During the time that I observed, all targets eventually disappeared at an average of 1 minute intervals. I hope this is helpful.  It will be interesting to triangulate various reports.  All the best,  ((NAME DELETED));42.2735770992367;-89.0522496183207
Red dot formations;2001-01-11 21:15:00;unknown;Red dot formations When I went outside I saw what looked like red dots just moving around.None were leaving just forming around each other. They moved gracefully and slowly--nothing like aircraft or fireballs or lights.Like it was gravity propelled only. All that witnessed this are professional business women alot with children.One even a pastors wife. ((NUFORC Note:  We believe the correct date is 11JA01.  We have changed it here.

9-11 orange-red lights in formation appear twice in 1 hour which can remain perfectly still  then travel exceedingly fast.;2001-02-10 21:50:00;45 min;9-11 orange-red lights in formation appear twice in 1 hour which can remain perfectly still  then travel exceedingly fast. At about 21:50, my 9 yr old son said Wow, the little dipper sure is bright tonight!  We looked out our W windows and looked NW. There we saw about 9-11 orange-red mostly motionless lights in the sky. They changed formation slightly.  About 2 then flew off and disappeared, then another 2 or so until there were only 2 left which then traveled directly S, at first close together and then more apart.  They were able to make pin point stops and continue.  We couldn't see them after they had traveled so far S. Then at about 22:30 they reappeared in the same spot in a diamond formation. I phoned a neighbor. A plane flew past and behind the formation.They disappeared as before but only 1 traveled S, stopped directly W, disappeared and I saw a white shooting star straight from sky to earth where the light was last.;42.2735770992367;-89.0522496183207
It was a formation of 9 lights that were changing position relative to each other (about the size of the big dipper or bigger);2001-02-10 22:25:00;15 minutes;It was a formation of 9 lights that were changing position relative to each other (about the size of the big dipper or bigger) On Saturday February 10th, 2001 Me and my wife were driving Eastbound in Rockford Illinois when at 22:25 a formation of lights in the sky caught my wifes attention and asked me what it was. Of course I had no clue either, but we noticed that we were not the only ones seeing it because most people driving the same way we were were pullng over on the side of the street to take a good look of the lights, which were traveling in a southwest direction. We pulled over in a Restaurant's parking lot, and we noticed all the patrons at that restaurant were outside watching those lights, despite the cold temperature which mut have been on the teens. he lady standing next to me theorized that they were some kind of memorial lanterns lit up and launched from a nearby hospital and that were being carried by the wind. However it was interesting to see that the lights were shfting positions very slowly and it was interesting to see that at the end of the sighting one of the lights started traveling in the opposite direction as the other lights.;42.2735770992367;-89.0522496183207
For about three minutes, we watched a formation of orangish lights all taking turns twinkling, then fading out.;2001-03-18 21:15:00;about 3 minutes;For about three minutes, we watched a formation of orangish lights all taking turns twinkling, then fading out. Four of us were getting ready to leave the house tonight, when suddenly my boyfriend, looking far out Northwest, began shouting Look! Look! There's those lights! (There have been previous sightings in town, supposedly). Everyone was freaking out- calling out their parents and neighbors. All in formation, I know there were at least six dim orange lights, but amidst the hustle-&-bustle it was hard to tell... especially since the lights appeared to be taking turns blinking EXTREMELY bright like flares (one-at-a-time). Each burst of light lasted, I'd say, about ten seconds or so. None of the lights moved-- they appeared to remain in the same spot the whole time I observed. It seemed during each interval between the twinklings, that each light faded into the darkness, and with the final visible light, there were eight witnesses standing in the same lawn-- seeing the same thing. Within 3 minutes from when I first saw the formation, they were all out of sight.;42.2735770992367;-89.0522496183207
