4 unidentified objects appeared in night sky in a formation of a Y hovering for several minutes.;2008-07-04 21:30:00;2 minutes;4 unidentified objects appeared in night sky in a formation of a Y hovering for several minutes. On July 4th, 2008, in Elmhurst, Illinois at approximately 9:30pm, 4 unidentified objects appeared in the night sky over the adjacent town of Bensenville, Illinois. At that time, my wife and I were watching the fireworks display taking place several miles to the north. We were sitting on the roof of our house, as in pervious years. The 4 objects appeared to the east of the fireworks, approximately 1-2 miles at an altitude of approximately 2-3 thousand feet in the air. The formation was in the shape of a Y.  The objects hovered at this location for several minutes, then disappeared. The objects were not fireworks in the sky. They were physical objects illuminated and hovering for several minutes.  This location is 4 miles south of Oâ€™Hare international airport.  No aircraft would ever be allowed to be that close to each other, especially 4 objects. I am submitting this report with the hope other people witnessed the objects and will report them as well.  No pictures were taken. No camera was in hand.;41.8957;-87.9435000000001
Intimidating Looking Red Disk Southwest of O'Hare Airport;2013-05-18 21:30:00;2 minutes each;Intimidating Looking Red Disk Southwest of O'Hare Airport UFO activity on 18-May-2013 started at about 9:30 PM.  My 10 year old son came in from outside and said he was calling me to see a UFO and he filmed it.  I saw the video and said OK, lets go outside again and go UFO hunting.  About 10:10PM a large RED UFO I could guess about 4,000ft above traveled from S.E. to N.W. on a slight curvature towards the west.  My son had his video camera and filmed it again.  I yelled for my wife and daughter to come out and see it.  My wife could only say Holy Crap!  My daughter said looking at it scared her.  It was rather large with some sort of energy emanating around it and silent. I've seen things like this before but this sighting was incredible.  I went outside to have a smoke again around midnight before I was going to go to bed and saw it shoot over again at almost lightning speed very close to the rear of another plane.  This thing looks very intimidating for some reason.   I would usually never report something like this but it's still zipping around just southwest of O'Hare airport.  It looked to be about 4 times the size of a 727 I saw it fly by.;41.8957;-87.9435000000001
