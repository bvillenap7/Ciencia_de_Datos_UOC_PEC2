It was grey in the front, the body was orangeish and brownish.  The lights were yellow- white and then blue tiny lights.  There were blue mist like exhaust on each side of it.  these were not flames.  I was frightened when I saw this.  It traveled from the west to the east.  We live near Ohare directly under a flight pattern.  It was ablout as high as a plane would be if it were landing at Ohare, on a cloudy day.  This was not a plane.;41.8957;-87.9435000000001
