Bright flashing point of light;2004-12-04 22:13:00;15 mins;Bright flashing point of light I was at my parents house and after watching a movie I went outside to have a cigarette.  The sky was clear and I noticed a bright stationary point of light fairly low toward the northeast (much brighter than any visible stars).  At first glance I thought it was an airplane on approach to O'Hare as the light was flickering between blue & white with a very random red flash mixed in.  After a few minutes I asked my parents to verify that it was flashing and they both confirmed.  We all agreed that it must have been a planet and went inside.  After a lot of boring researche online, I could not find a reasonable planetary explanation.  A couple of hours later it wass gone.;41.8957;-87.9435000000001
