Too fast for a balloon or blimp, too colorful and soundless;2008-08-16 22:00:00;1-2 minutes;Too fast for a balloon or blimp, too colorful and soundless Four of us were sitting on our deck and my brother in law saw a very bright object coming at him exactly west.  we all watched this orange-red object fly directly west towards Lake Michigan.  It looked like it was on fire because of the orange-red so we assummed that it was a meteor.  There was no tail.  It never varied it's speed.  It was flying against the flight patterns of O'Hare Airport.  It was following the path of planes very high overhead going cross country, but it was much lower.  There were no navigation lights in the front or back of the object.  A little while later we saw a satelite and it had a totally different shape and color.  The other interesting part of this is we were able to hear airplanes (the engines) all around us and farther away that the object that passed almost directly over us.  The object that passed over us had no sound what-so-ever. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));41.8957;-87.9435000000001

A train had just ended next to the quarry that had completely filled up with run-off water from Salt Creek.  Many people were stopped to look at the quarry.  We came over the tracks and noticed that everyone was looking upward.  We looked upward and there wwere 2 fireball objects passing overhead with another one in the west.  Steady speed, no sound at all, no navigation lights.  This is exactly the same object that we saw less than 1 month ago on a night with a full moon.;41.8957;-87.9435000000001
