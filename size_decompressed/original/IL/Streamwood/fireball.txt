Orange Glowing Orb low across from SE to NW a Yearly 7/4 site.;2011-07-04 21:55:00;20 SEC;Orange Glowing Orb low across from SE to NW a Yearly 7/4 site. I have reported this in the past 2 years also.  You can see my prior reports on same day at approx. same time.  I think someone may be trying to create a hoax because it happens, so far, every 4th of July soon after fireworks (over past 3 years I’ve seen it). It was approx 9:55 pm.  An orange glowing orb glided slowly across the sky from the (approx) SW toward the NW for about 15 to 20 secs.  I and a friend made sure to have binoculars handy this time and sure enough, the same sighting as in the past two years.  We saw no other lights on the craft just a glowing orange ball. The Orange Glow seemed to intensify and then dull a little a few times (like manipulating a dimmer) but for the most part was steady.  Then, it just dimmed a bit and went abruptly totally out, while I was looking at it in my binoculars.   But, I could not see anything of a craft once the glow disappeared.  I looked with bare eyes then again with binoculars.  And could not see a thing, nothing.. it was gone.   Also, there were no other lights, none flashing or steady like a normal plane or helicopter etc. Anyway, I hope u were able to have someone out here this year to try and catch it and find out what the heck this is and if someone is hoaxing it.  Ill watch your site intermittently to see if you found an answer and if anyone else reports same. What keeps intriguing me on this is that I do see other sightings of apparently similar looking orbs in the night sky…..and some on the say day. Ill keep reporting and watching for answers. Thanks for being the place to go to report these things!  Anonymous	 Streamwood ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));42.0221;-88.1705
