The light was mostly bright blue with some red, which is something I hadn't even seen in a plane.  It also was not seeming to move hardly at all. Pulled over to parking lot of a market to get a closer look.  The shape of the lights seem to be solid, in a cross and continued to hover.  Hadn't ever seen anything like it.  Could not identify what shape what may have been with the lights.  Took a picture with my phone through the car window, most of which ended up being the window itself.  You can see a bright blue light, but no other detail. Before I could snap another picture, it started to very slowly lower down before it was just gone.;42.0221;-88.1705
