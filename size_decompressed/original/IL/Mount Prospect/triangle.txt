Did anyone else witness the bright strobe light  triangular objects in the sky over Mt. Prospect, Illinois 7-28-05;2005-07-28 14:15:00;5 minutes;Did anyone else witness the bright strobe light  triangular objects in the sky over Mt. Prospect, Illinois 7-28-05 On 7-28-05 at 4:14 am I was looking out my upstairs window facing west and saw two triangular shaped objects in the sky.  At first, I thought they were planes.  After watching these objects in the sky I discovered they were not regular planes with lights on.  Under these objects were bright almost strobe light effects of yellow, blue, green and red constantly flashing in a strobe like fashion.  Particles of Gold sprinkles were being dispersed from these flying objects almost as if they were spraying different areas of the neighborhood.  In the morning, I called the non-emergency police # for Mt. Prospect and asked if any other calls had come into the station regarding my sighting.  The dispatcher said he was not aware of any other calls.;42.0648000000001;-87.9356000000002
