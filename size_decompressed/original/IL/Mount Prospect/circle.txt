Bright white stationary star-like object;2019-07-06 17:30:00;10-30 seconds;Bright white stationary star-like object While driving west on Dempster Avenue in Mt. Prospect on July 6, 2019, my wife and I spotted a very bright, star-like object in the sky, possibly over Schaumburg, Streamwood or Elgin.  It was around 5:30 p.m. so still very light out.  We figured it was an airplane catching the sun and reflecting it, but after watching it for about ten or fifteen seconds (during which it did not appear to move), we never saw the object turn and transform into a plane.  The object remained a bright white dot until it just disappeared completely from the cloudless sky.;42.0648000000001;-87.9356000000002
