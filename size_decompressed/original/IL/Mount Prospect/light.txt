We jumped out of bed and looked out of the window, toward the northeast, and saw a cluster of bright lights at very low altitude. My best guess is about 3000-5000 feet. it looked like six bright white lights in a hexagonal cluster with a bright blue light offset from the middle and a flashing bright light near the bottom. The red light was the brightest of the lights. It was moving very fast from the east to the west. I ran to the front of the house and looked out of the front window to get a better view. and saw it for about another 10 seconds before I lost sight of it behind some trees.;42.0648000000001;-87.9356000000002
