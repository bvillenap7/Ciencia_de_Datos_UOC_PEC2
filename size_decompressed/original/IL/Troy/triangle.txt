Silent Black Triangle Aircraft Sighted in Illinois Suburb.;2006-11-29 19:00:00;5 minutes;Silent Black Triangle Aircraft Sighted in Illinois Suburb. On November 25, 2006 at 7 pm, I stepped outside for a cigarette and looked up at the stars as I usually do at night.  To my surprise, I noticed an aircraft flying slower than any other aircraft I had ever seen. This aircraft was black, had aircraft marker lights that were not bright.  The lights were red and blue colored.  I also noticed in the rear bottom of the aircraft there was what I can describe as what looked like a vent.  It was a dull silver color.  What really distinguished this aircraft was that it flew completely silent. It was no more than 100 ft. above my home and there was absolutely no noise. I went back inside to get my wife to show her. When we both stepped outside it was gone. I was the only one to witness this to my knowledge.;38.727;-89.8728
