Strange sounds in the Greater St Louis area.;2013-01-16 01:30:00;15-20 minutes;Strange sounds in the Greater St Louis area. No craft seen.  However, a very strange recurring noise is being heard.  It is a low thrumming similar to the sound of several helicopters all flying together.  But there aren't any helicopters.  I haven't seen any flying craft of any sort when this is happening.  I've heard this noise multiple times throughout the month of January.  When I first heard it I assumed it WAS a group of helicopters operating out of the nearby Scott Air Force Base (which has no helicopters based there, by the way).  However, unlike aircraft in which the Doppler effect causes sound to grow and then fade away as the aircraft passes overhead, this sound grew like an approaching aircraft but then just remained constant!  I can discern no direction from which the sound is coming.  It is just everywhere.  Then it dies down and goes away after several minutes--about 30 minutes is the longest I've heard it.  Very strange.;38.727;-89.8728
