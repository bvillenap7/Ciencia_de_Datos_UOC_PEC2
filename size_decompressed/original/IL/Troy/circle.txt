It was something not from this world.;1997-07-04 20:00:00;5 seconds;It was something not from this world. Everyone was at the park watching the sky waiting for the fireworks to start when we all saw a light blue colored disc that was moving fast.  When I mean everyone, I mean the entire town of Troy at the park.  I remember them talking about it on the news later that night. ((NUFORC Note:  Many other reports of this incident.  The object was first reported from Kentucky, then from Illinois, and finally from Missouri.  PD));38.727;-89.8728
