My son and I were driving south on Troy-Ofallon road when suddenly a yellow/orange fireball appeared in the Eastern sky travellling at a very high speed.   We both were not sure if it landed and my son asked me if it was a shooting star which i have seen may times.  This was not a shooting star.;38.727;-89.8728
Orange ball of light.;2013-07-19 22:05:00;60 seconds;At approximately 2205  July 19, 2013 my wife and I were sitting outside and from the southwest a large orange ball of light, traveling at a moderate speed, was approaching.  We observed it for at least 60 seconds as it headed towards the northeast. It started to fade after that.  Its altitude was hard to determine.  If I had to guess, I would say  4,000 to 5,000 feet.   When I first observed the orange ball it was so dramatic, for a split second, I thought it was an aircraft that was on fire.  You could hear no noise.   My wife took some pictures and a video which I will forward if you are interested. At approximately 2235 July 19, 2013, as we were contemplating going into the house, I looked east and observed another orange ball of light coming from the southeast and heading towards the northwest.  It appeared to be traveling at the same speed as our first observance.  It appeared to gain altitude as it moved.   We observed this object for about the same amount of time as the first one before it faded.  My wife also took a picture and video of this one.   We sit outside, at night,  quite often and have never seen something that was so stunning .;38.727;-89.8728
