Bright hovering color changing light- red, orange, yellow, white;2012-05-12 23:42:00;3 min;Bright hovering color changing light- red, orange, yellow, white Observed while driving on Hwy 146 just east of Vienna, Il. At first I thought it was a star but it was an overcast night and there were no other stars visible.  As I approached I saw it changed colors methodically from white to yellow, orange, then red with no flashing just a constant star-like light  changing colors about every second. I realized it was not like anything I have ever witnessed. It illuminated the cloud cover that was apparentl y just above it. I slowed and heard nothing that would indicate a craft such ad helicopter as it was apparently hovering in one spot.  As I passed, I kept my eye on it in the rear view mirror for about 15 seconds then it just disappeared. I reluctantly contacted the local sheriff's department to inquire about any other sightings of the light or poss...ible aircrafts in the vicinity.  There were no other reports or aircrafts;37.4189;-88.8907
