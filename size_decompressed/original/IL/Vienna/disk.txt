Driving down the road, I noticed a big glowing light.  I watched the light cause I have never seen such a big bright light like that in the sky before.  It was very dark outside, and as I watched this light get closer it began to dim.  It was now behind us and you could see it rotationg with orange, yellow, and red lights flashing and moving on this object.    As it began to move into the distance it picked up speed, and it was gone within 6-7 minutes.;37.4189;-88.8907
