He is honest and very aware of details.  He was woken up from sleeping because he heard loud humming sound.  He said he felt like the house was vibrating.  He looked out the window and saw a round object object that had 3 wings.  One of these wings had a propeller type thing at the end of it.  Very bright lights.  One blue light.  One red light and several white lights.   It was hovering in neighbors yard across the street.  He said it hovered there for a moment then raised straight in the sky and came to our yard, where be said it hovered in our yard for about 1 min, then flew over our house and he lost sight of it.  He called me(I was at work) and he was absolutely terrified about what he had just seen.  I asked him to draw me a picture on his phone of what he had seen and he did.  I've always been a skeptic of UFO sightings but I know my son was not lying about what he saw.  He has a great ability to pay attention to detail.;37.4189;-88.8907
