Numerous spheres moving across sky.;2015-07-02 21:40:00;20 minutes;Numerous spheres moving across sky. Me and my brother were sitting watching tv and my brother said hey I think a helicopter is going to the hospital, so we both went out on or our deck to see if it was a helicopter, usually when they go to the hospital you can hear them, and they fly really low. Well the large orange light was perfectly silent, and kept going on its east to west pattern.  We both thought it was strange as it made no noise whatsoever, and had no blinking lights like a helicopter would. To our amazement about 3 mins later another light followed.  At this point we woke our dad up and told him hey like 3 ufos just flew over.  He came outside so we could have another witness. About 6 orange lights flew over equally spaced about 3mins apart.  The last time it flew over it was a pair of 2 orange lights.  They were spaced apart and maintained the same speed.  I would guess about 1kmph to 1.5kmph.  Each of the lights took the same flight path, and had the same speed.  The lights did not get brighter or dimmer at any time.  None of the lights had additional bliking lights that would mark it as a jet or airplane. If you have seen this as well or have any questions please feel free to email me;41.8512;-90.1518
