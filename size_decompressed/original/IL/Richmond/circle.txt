White light with white beam spotted across small field in rural Illinois;2007-09-20 21:00:00;15 minutes;White light with white beam spotted across small field in rural Illinois While walking from a school event to a gas station, my friends and I saw a white, circular light in the sky from across a field about .5 square acres. We, at first, thought it was a small aircraft, but it was very close to the ground. The light showed that it was very maneuverable in its sporadic, three-dimensional movements. Unique to this light, however, was a beam of a lighter white going from the main light (letâ€™s say craft) to the ground. The light could move independently from the movement of the craft itself, and it searched from the trees surrounding the field to about the middle of the field. The craft continued these actions for about 15 minutes until it traveled to the tree line. The movements then switched to only a line parallel to our side of the field on the opposite side above the trees. The light remained on the ground for 1 more minute until the craft got brighter (as if its beam were shining at us). I and my friends got the distinct feeling that it has seen us seeing it. Then, in the blink of an eye, it was gone. It did not go below the trees. It did not fly up to the sky. It simply disappeared.;42.4669;-88.2879
