Bright light appeared out of nowhere;2003-08-19 04:50:00;3 seconds;Bright light appeared out of nowhere I was sitting on my driveway staring at the stars when suddenly, in the sky to my far left a bright white light appeared out of nowhere, it was pretty high in the sky but it was easily visible even against the dawn breaking, I don't think it was a satellite because it was very bright and did not stay on a continuous course, it streaked in a straight line for about 2 seconds then veared sharply to the left and disappeared.;41.8033;-87.9283
