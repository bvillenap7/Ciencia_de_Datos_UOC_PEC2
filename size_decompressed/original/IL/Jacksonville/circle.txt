Three gold circle UFOs fly in formation, warp drive away and disappear.;1989-10-01 20:00:00;five minutes;Three gold circle UFOs fly in formation, warp drive away and disappear. Was driving north when I noticed a large gold circle about the size of the moon fairly high in the sky. It was moving back and forth from south to north, north to south.  I turned into the driveway of my home and continued watching it. After a short time two more circle shaped lights came out from each side of the first one looking like they might have come from within or perhaps from behind it. The three lights commenced doing a formation moving in slow patterns. Then they shot away as if in warp drive one after the other the northern most shooting first to the north, then the middle and south most following it disappearing suddenly almost right after. The incident lasted around five minutes.  A day or two after it was reported in the paper that others had seen a UFO in a nearby town that same night, unfortunately I canâ€™t remember the date or time of the incident since it was way back in the eighties and I am a non-linear person. It was probably between 7 to nine pm and it seems like it was fall weather. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.  PD));39.7343;-90.2291
