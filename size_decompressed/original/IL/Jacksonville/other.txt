Disk-on-disk UFO making atmosphere around it pulsate;2012-09-17 18:00:00;10 minutes;disk-on-disk UFO making atmosphere around it pulsate In the backyard of my house, my brother and I were grilling out at around 6 p.m.  While waiting for our burgers to cook, we were shooting off some left over bottle rockets we found from independence day.  As he launched his bottle rocket off, something caught my eye.  I noticed an object flying what seemed to be a little to low for a normal airline plane. I noticed that it was slow moving and not shaped like an airline's aircraft and it had no exhaust trail and made no noise.  I pointed this object out to my brother and both of us were dumbfounded by this event.  Hat was most fascinating to me about this object is that it seemed to run an odd path in the sky and the atmosphere surrounding the object appeared distorted such as the heat waves you would see radiating off of hot pavement.  It didn't distort in a heat-wave type pattern though.  It was more of a pulsating visual as though it were bending light rays from its form of propulsion. The object seemed to be a dull metallic disk, with a smaller disk stacked on top of it, and it moved in a smooth elliptical path heading north before slowly, and gradually, decreasing in size until it finally disappeared.
