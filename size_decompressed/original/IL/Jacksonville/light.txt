A mysterious blue light filled my room and I felt a friendly presence.;1996-07-15 01:30:00;5 Minutes;A mysterious blue light filled my room and I felt a friendly presence. It was one or one-thirty in the morning on a warm summer night in July.  I was only five years old at this time.  My window was open in my bedroom on the first floor of my house, facing towards the backyard.  I had abruptly awoken to a loud humming sound coming from outside.   After a few seconds, I noticed a blue light that seemed to be coming from my open window.  At first, it was very faint and hardly noticeable but after the course of a few minutes (three to five), the blue light had become so bright that it covered everything in my field of vision.   I tried to go and get my parents, but I was paralyzed, either out of shock from the event or from an unknown force.  All of the sudden, I felt a presence in the room.   At first I was scared, but then I felt a strong reassurance that the presence was not there to harm me.  Then, with an overwhelming flash of white light, the buzzing sound stopped and the blue light disappeared.   After this, I was able to move, and went to the windows to see what had happened.  I looked out into the lawn, and everything looked eerily still.  The trees weren’t moving, the grass wasn’t waving, and there wasn’t a single ripple in the pool.   Since that day, I have never seen that blue light again. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));39.7343;-90.2291

The rest of the seven appeared in the same manner. The lights were orange/amber and were not flashing. At approx. 9:30 pm on 10/18/98, while stopped on a country road, four people witnessed the appearance of an orangish light seemingly out of nowhere traveling slowly south. In approx. 10 minute intervals more would appear in the same spot and follow the same pattern traveling slowly south. We were unable to make out an actual shape and eventually each would travel out of site.;39.7343;-90.2291
