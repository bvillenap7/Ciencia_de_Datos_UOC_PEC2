4 orange glowing, non flickering spheres, very crisp and clear.;2012-11-19 19:00:00;20 seconds;4 orange glowing, non flickering spheres, very crisp and clear. Was returning home from work and passing a radio station and tower on the East edge of town.  Was going over a bridge over the rail road tracks and Sighted a Single light a few hundred feet above my car.  First i thought it was beacon light on transmitter tower and realized it was solid orange and not the tower light.  As i got to the top of the bridge I looked back forward and Saw 3 more. orange brightly glowing spheres.  Weather was extremely foggy and could only see a few hundred feet in any direction.  This is a 2 lane road i was on and couldnt jsut stop.  I slowed to about 15 miles and hour and was leaning forward to look up at them thru the windshield.  I had already past the first. the other 3 were in view. lasted 20 seconds at most.  But they were 2-3 ft round spheres glowing a bright but defined and non-flickering orange light.  At first i wanted to believe they were chinese lanters.  But they were smooth round, and orange no flickering. they were moving east-south east fairly slowly.  It was a calm foggy light.  Once i got home &ltapprox 2 minutes later&gt I decided to go look for them again. I drove around the area for 10-15 minutes stopping and looking all the way to the interstate and did not see them again.;39.7343;-90.2291
