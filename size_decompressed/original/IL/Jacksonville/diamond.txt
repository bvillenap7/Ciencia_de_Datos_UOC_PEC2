Bright Orange Light appearing & disappearing;2002-01-24 20:30:00;20 seconds;Bright Orange Light appearing & disappearing At approx. 8:30 p.m on Jan. 24th, 2002 I was driving north on clay ave and noticed a diamond shaped  bright orange light directly in my view at about the level a plane would be - after viewing it for about 5 seconds it dissappeared and immediatly reappeared up and to the east of where I first saw it and then disappeared again and reappeared once more north of where it originally appeared - all the while I was driving directly toward it and it never reappeared again. (*)representing light: *(last here) *(then here) *(first appeared here) Sort of a triangular shape in the way it appeared. Not sure if it was one craft or 3 seperate ones. Only one light appeared at a time. Would be very interested in knowing if anyone else saw this. The were other cars on the road but it happened so quickly I don't know.
