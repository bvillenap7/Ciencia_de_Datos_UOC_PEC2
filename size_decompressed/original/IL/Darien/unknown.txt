I thought at first it might be a helecoper, but there was no sound coming from it, nothing;1980-06-05 01:00:00;less the 2mins;I just stepped out on to the patio to try to get my dog to go out who would not come out of the house she started to bark and took off in the other direction.  Then suddenly just a few feet higher then my roof hovering were 8 very bright large lights pointed right in my direction, (4 on top 4 across the bottom).I couldnt tell any shape because the lights were so bright and it was dark outside. I thought at first it might be a helecoper, but there was no sound coming from it, nothing.I couldnt believe how close to the ground this was. So I waved and just as quickly as it appeared it went up and sideways, and in less then a blink it was gone. Totally silent. No engine sound, no propellers, nothing. What ever if was it was very cool. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));41.7448;-87.9818999999999
5 orage lit objects acending out of our orbit in formation much like the shuttle.;2010-06-19 22:45:00;1.3;5 orange lit objects acending out of our orbit in formation much like the shuttle. driving down an unlit road to my home, I saw five orange objects in the sky.   At first I thought that they were flares or something to that effect. Then I realized that they were flying objects acending in formation.  I realized this because the o'hare and midway flight traffic continued as normal and these crafts were moving in a totally different pattern.  my vantage point was looking southwest.  these objects were ascending southwest to northeast.   Two objects out front, followed by one single object in the center of the formation, followed by two objects at the tail end of the formation.  they ascended into the stars much like the last nighttime launch of the space shuttle of which i saw first hand.  Very similar!  They were too high in the sky to give a discription of size or shape.   Please investigate.  Thanks Peter.
