balls of light over chicago burbs;2006-09-21 00:30:00;few seconds;balls of light over chicago burbs I was sitting out back on 9/21/2006 looking at a very clear sky in the southwest suburbs of chicago. My friend and i were just looking at the stars. My friend looked down for a second and i continued staring straight up. Then, an oval shape, yellowish green light appeared in front of me in the sky, and then shot off to the south in a matter of 2 seconds but was visible long enough for me to get a pretty good look at it. Ive seen meteors and comets and shoting stars, it was none of those. It just appeared and then zoomed away silently. I immediatly told my friend but he was too late to catch it. We continued to watch the sky, and about 5 minutes later, we BOTH saw a white light appear in the sky, and zoom very fast off to the southeast from the northwest and dissapear before our eyes. This light though was a round, white ball of light but was visible for about 4 seconds and we both immediatly reacted out loud to it.;41.7448;-87.9818999999999
