Flying Black Egg Craft? Is this the way a Chupacabra Travels?;2008-05-23 07:22:00;40 seconds;Flying Black Egg Craft? Is this the way a Chupacabra Travels? In the morning I went to look outside my front door window and was looking at clouds thinking I will see something and saw a black egg shaped object flying over my house. It could of been just a black balloon ,but the wind outside was going a different direction thinking the wind would of blown the black balloon in a different direction. The Black egg shaped craft was going from 99th and cicero towards 150 and cicero. Looked like it was going atleast 200 miles per hour.  Looked the size of a balloon. I did not have a camera on me and didn't run to go get one. Looked to be heading towards Saint Linus Church and have to of gone over it and it was close to cicero but was atleast a block and a half away from cicero. The object made no sound. If a Chupacabra travels I think this is the way they do travel in a very small black egg size craft. Unless it was really a balloon. It look to be atleast 400 feet High in the air. I see alot of things and report alot and say what I think. Why, I say this is I saw a something that could of have been a Chupacabra.
