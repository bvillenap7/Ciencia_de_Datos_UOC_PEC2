Maybe Nasa Missle Launch or we have an orange Chariot;2011-09-10 08:00:00;7 seconds;Maybe Nasa Missle Launch or we have an orange Chariot I was on corner of my house and saw blending in like orange colored 2 small horse with 1 big horse in middle Chariot go over the tree near the sidewalk moving slow.  I ran in 3 spots in my house to get my new nikon coolpix s8100 and it was gone when it should of still been there when I ran back outside. Could this be Nasa Missle Launch?  This happened between 745 to 8pm when the sun was slowing going down.  It was getting close I had a choice to stay and watch or go get camera. I hope birds and fish are not found dead.  Also my heart goes out to the anyone love ones lost in 9-11 ten years ago. Same color of what I reported in Oak Lawn January 1, 2011 when fish and birds were reported dead.

Pilot might of saw what I saw and object flying was maybe just a Chinese Candle or Chinese Latern.;2012-05-06 19:55:00;4 Minutes;Pilot might of saw what I saw and object flying was maybe just a Chinese Candle or Chinese Latern. At 7:55PM I saw something orange flying with no blinking light that was maybe just a flying chinese orange candle/lantern. The orange object flying was flying about the same speed as the plane and just about the same height as the plane. I was thinking it was a plane at first, but the plane with a blinking white light was flying right to left and the orange thing flying had no blinking light was coming sorta towards me, than passed almost in front of the plane that was going right to left. I was outside talking on cellphone and had to call back later. I got off the cellphone and tryed to film orange thing flying. I did not turn the phone camcorder on correctly and as I noticed the phone camcorder was not on I ended up turning it on this time and the orange thing flying turned black. I turned cellphone camera on correctly this time and failed to film it when the orange object turned smaller & turned black as soon as I turned the cellphone camera on correctly ! this time and nothing showed up on the cellpone camcorder footage because when it turned black it would not show on the cellphone camera footage because it was too small to film and a email on cellphone camcorder interruped me when I trying to film it. Also when trying to film the settings on the cellphone camcorder has to much contrast when I was filming and maybe it should of had the cellphone camera setting set on night option, since it was just starting to get dark outside. I continue to watch it when it turned black and just disappeared as it was flying sorta over my head. The pilot flying the plane had to of seen the orange object flying and pilot flying plane with blinking light was maybe coming from Midway Airport.

Possible drone flyby?;2015-01-18 05:35:00;25 seconds;Possible drone flyby? I saw a non blinking whitish orange light fly by very fast, moving across the clear sky past the very end of handle of the big dipper.  If you focus your eyes really hard you could barely see a very tiny red light blink every five seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

It then broke into two, and then both did wide turns on opposite sides at the same time.   They both faded away at the same time too.

Mothman?  UFO?  Black balloon that poped in the air?  ((anonymous report));2017-06-10 18:00:00;20-30 seconds;Mothman?  UFO?  Black balloon that poped in the air?  I just thought I would report this because of the Mothman sightings happening here. I'm late reporting this.  It happened either June 10 or the 11th.  I saw a black dot in the far distance moving right and then disappeared when a plane from Midway airport was closing in on it.   I tried to film it but the camera was picking up too much brightness.   I don't know what is was.   Today is June 17th and was just hearing alot of sightings happening with Mothman lately in Chicago, so I thought I would report this.

Red flashing lights moving very fast in the sky and then disappeared.;2020-10-16 00:00:00;3 seconds;Red flashing lights moving very fast in the sky and then disappeared. I looked out the window and seen bright red flashing lights in the sky moving at a very fast pace, I knew it wasn't an airplane or anything that I have ever seen before. As I got closer to the window it just disappeared from the sky like poof, gone! It was closer to the ground, it was not very high up in the sky either.;41.7123999999999;-87.7478000000001
