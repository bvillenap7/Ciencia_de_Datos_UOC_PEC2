UFO Cigar I think I saw was crazy;2011-03-10 16:47:00;4 seconds;UFO Cigar I think I saw was crazy I was driving over metra train tracks down a street called Central going towards 95th street.  I saw out my car windshield window I saw a hazey, glarey, white colored cigar shaped U.F.O. going right to left in like a 45 degree angle and I saw it for 4 seconds because either trees,homes or clouds made me lose sight of the U.F.O..  It past a clear section in the blue sky.  It look like how a plane takes off and never saw one take off this fast and was bigger than a plane + had no wings.  The glaring bright sun was out towards the back left side of car.  I might be mistaken for the sun glaring on a plane taking off near midway airport and I am not sure because never saw anything like it as I took a right on 95th I called someone to tell them about what happened and saw a plane 55 seconds later going down that same direction the U.F.O was going.  First it looked like almost like a fireball,than thinking like the surfboard of the silver surfer marvel comic and than after thinking about it I say for sure cigar shaped.  There was scattered clouds on the left and right of the clear blue sky section I saw the U.F.O. at.  It just moved to fast and was to big to be a plane.  I was talking about it all day and I am gonna sumit this report at 12:45am on 03/11/2011.  The plane traffic was higher today and planes were flying lower than I normally see.  This happened around 4:47pm on 03/10/2011.  It looked like a failed attempt to blend in the sky.  I saw another U.F.O. in the past in this same area like 10 years.
