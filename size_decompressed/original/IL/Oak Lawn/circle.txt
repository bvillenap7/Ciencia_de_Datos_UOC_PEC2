I saw a Fenced area grass big field with a fence that says do not enter. Traffic started to started moving faster. I saw about 4 cop cars and a firetruck next to the fenced area that says do not enter. I saw all the police standing by the fence like they were scared to enter because it said do not enter. what I saw beyond that fence was a huge circle of burnt grass and smoke going in the air like some type of craft landed there. I drive back the next day and all the land is now cement parking lot that looks like it has been there for years like they changed the land or something. But the do not enter sign is still there on the fence. The land has changed. Unless I am going crazy or the Thing that landed there playing mind games with me showing me that it can chang land on how it looks to mess with me but you will never have proof of that. I told my boss at work I saw a perfect circle of smoke in that field & a do not enter sign. I saw a grassed area on fire and now it is gona and turned into a do not enter parking lot and the parking lot looks like it has been there for over 50 years. I swear what i saw looked like a crafted landed ina a grass area now the grass area is gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

Atleast 10-15 of them all in a row same color going the same direction, I went inside to grab my binoculars (keep in mind i didnt have a camera or video recorder) & tryed to see w/ the binoculars.

Round red/orange ball 1/3 size of full Moon with yellow V-shaped flame inside.;2011-07-24 20:45:00;aprox 1 minute;Round red/orange ball 1/3 size of full Moon with yellow V-shaped flame inside. On July 24, 2011, my cousin was sitting in our backyard facing east at aprox. 9:45 CDT when he sighted a red/orange ball moving in the sky in the SE between the tree branches and near a radio tower at aprox. 20 degrees elevation.   The ball of light was aprox. the size of Jupiter when first sighted but grew to about 1/3 the diameter of a full moon when nearly over head and then shrank in size as it moved to the NW.    The ball of light moved steadily towards the NW and gained maximum elevation of aprox. 80 degrees before vanishing in the NW at aprox. 40 degrees elevation.  During the portion of the flight path from aprox. 45 degrees elevation in the SE to aprox. 60 degrees elevation in the NW the ball of light had what appeared to be a yellow V-shaped area inside the orange ball that extended half way across the ball and moved as if it were a flame  like a pilot flame on a water heater.   The wide end of the yellow V-shaped area faced down and the point was up.   When the ball went behind some trees my cousin rushed into the house to alert me.  I immediately went outside the front of our house and viewed the orange ball in the NW at aprox. 40 degrees elevation between some trees.   The orange ball at this point was the size of Jupiter and appeared to shimmer slightly as if we were viewing it through the atmosphere at a great distance.  There were no attached blinking lights as seen on aircraft just the orange ball.  The ball was too small to see the yellow V at this point.  We both watched the ball of light for about 15-20 seconds before is slowly dimmed and could not be seen.  During this time the ball moved slightly lower in elevation.;41.7123999999999;-87.7478000000001

Orange ball flying above FAA drone heights near Midway Airport.;2019-04-26 21:00:00;4 minutes;Orange ball flying above FAA drone heights near Midway Airport. It flew slowly from west to east and then turned slightly and headed south east.  There are many airplanes and helicopters in my area but this was flying  much slower then a helicopter or landing airplane.  There is a video i will upload it after my description.  It was a bright orange circle solid in color not blinking and had no other lights and was completely silent.  Also, the wind was blowing west north west at 8mph this was going east and made a southern manuver before it rose upwards into the clouds.  I zoomed in to get a better picture of the object and also zoomed  out so the houses and trees can be used a reference the video explains everything in great detail.;41.7123999999999;-87.7478000000001
