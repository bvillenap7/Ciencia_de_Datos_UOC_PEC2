Square Shaped with fire in middle and birds/fish found dead;2011-01-01 00:13:00;20 seconds;Square Shaped with fire in middle and birds/fish found dead While the fireworks were starting to cool off all around 13 minutes after Midnight on New Year Day. Thinking about U.F.O. 15 minutes before this happened which was kinda strange. Looked to be a no sound fire in middle of something square shaped while flying straight and not bobbling at all. Showed a witness who was sitting down on floor who saw it out window from there sitting position. I ran to get camera but the square shape Fire in middle U.F.O. was gone and should of been able to see it. Then Monday around 2 O'clock on channel 9 MGN news reported like 5,000 black Birds found dead all over Illinois on roofs of peoples homes. Then another report of about 5,000 certain type of fish was found dead New Year Morning. I can't confirm it was 5,000 Black Birds and 5,000 Fish my numbers can be off. I am not sure fireworks all over Illinois do that to just Black Birds or a certain type of fish. Well, I can't confirm this was a Chinese Candle or Moving Flares. I was! thinking this was an Invisible object that powered on to get away from the Fireworks (maybe). Why just black birds and a certain type of fish? I think what I saw had to do with these dead Black birds and Certain type of goldfish. I am going to find about now about this dead animal report. I think U.F.O. it was headed toward Mount greenwood near Chicago. Look about 40 feet long dark red square craft with fire in the middle. It was around 1000 to 2000 thousand feet hight in the air. Moving about 175 miles an hour I am guessing. Find the news WGN report was played January 3 2011 WGN News Chicago about the dead birds and animal found everywhere. Hope there is other who heard this story on the 3rd of January and I hope others saw the UFO on New Years after Midnight during the celebration. The U.F.O left no trail.;41.7123999999999;-87.7478000000001
