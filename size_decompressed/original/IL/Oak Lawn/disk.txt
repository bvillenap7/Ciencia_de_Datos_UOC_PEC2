1950's type style u.f.o ready and waxed;2004-10-06 14:35:00;10 seconds then 2 seconds;1950's type style u.f.o ready and waxed I was driving to work down 95st past Dennys restraunt on the borderline of Oak Lawn that leads to Chicago Ridge, and Palos Hills. I looked up in the sky, the sky was clear,but looked like down 10 miles down by Palos Hills there were a few small clouds and one 150 foot cloud looked as if a hoving disk drove thru the cloud twice on each end side going up or down on the right and left side of this 150 foot looking cloud. The burnout hoving marks on the left and right side of the 150 foot cloud had the same length width and height of 35 feet. Making the hoving burnout look as if it strach the cloud on each side. I seened these marks on this cloud thats why Iwas looking up in the sky. The cloud looked as if the cloud was the length of 150 feet from left to right,by width on 60 feet going up and down,the girth of the cloud seemed to be 270 feet. As I was driving still down 95st looking at the cloud for 15 seconds while glancing up and down trying to not get in no car accident maintaining the 30mph I stoped at a red light glancing back at the cloud I watched a polish waxed silver 1950's looking u.f.o disk smaller than the ufo hoving type cloud streching burnout marks I saw, it looked like a real small version of the 1950's looking u.f.o. it was so far looked to be at least 5 to 10 feet in height and 7 to 13 in length from right to left. When I was at the red light I watch the disk 30 feet from the right side of the cloud driving in a straight line from right to left enter the 150 foot cloud then disappeared in cloud at speeds of 100 miles per hour in the middle of the cloud I seened it in the middle of the cloud still moving in the same 100 mph speeds for 2 seconds still driving left. The light turned green,I continued to drive expecting to see the disk agian,thinking at 100 mph it would of been out of the 150 foot length cloud by now,glanced and stared at the cloud for 15 minutes on the way to work and the disk never cam out of the cloud from the left side as I was driving. This is the 3rd time I seened something,but this is my 1st I reported. Back in 1985 i seened a skinny tall shadow very athletic jump on my back fence and hissed at me with snake tongue in dark ,violently and I ran in fear i seened as when it jumped on fence and heard fence rattle fast as if his foot right foot was gasped up on fence as if his knee was 3 feet over his head,pointyknee,and in 2002 of march I seened liquid metal u.f.o as if some type of magnet in the sky swirled around liquid and could rewind itself while moving in a 60 degree angle and disapear and then come back then throw a fit moving in angles all over the place in nonstop different directions as fast as moving a flashlite around. Looked like it was studing planes the way they take off I seened it with a kindergarten teacher. It also seemed as if it had some kind of capacity camalflog disappear and reappear and was having technicial diffaculties with his camelflog. I could see ripple of waves on the liquid moving. At one point it looked like the cartoons surfboard the silver surfer.;41.7123999999999;-87.7478000000001
