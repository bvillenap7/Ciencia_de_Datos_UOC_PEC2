((anonymous report));2017-05-15 18:40:00;2 minutes;I'm not sure if they were just balloons. 1st one I noticed was going left and the 2nd showed up 50 minutes going straight/right. I forget the exact times I saw them both.  The first one I saw was at around 6:35PM and the second one I saw was at about 7:20PM.  The first and second were both black and small. They both were going in directions.  The first one was farther away to take a photo of.  The first was super high in the sky prepared to the second one was lower.  They both were moving slow at around the same speed.   The second was super close and going over a house past a plane that must of took off from midway airport.  I couldn't take a video of it because I was on the phone with an old friend.  I told the friend who lives in Florida now when I was on the phone with him that it was going over your old house right now because he use to live in Illinois.  I told him on the phone it might be just a balloon.  The second one seem to chang shape a little or it was slowly rotating.  I saw the first one for about 15 seconds and the second one for about 2 minutes.  It felt like there was no wind outside.
