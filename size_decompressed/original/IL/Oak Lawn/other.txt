It was similar to a top and the color was similar to amber . The drone craft's appearance was similar to a toy top.  It was a spring day and I had some windows opened to enjoy the cool air.  I was in my kitchen and just ended a telephone call when I walked into my hallway.  I turned to the left adjacent to the laundry room and saw this craft.  I was stunned and also quite surprised.  I was scared and walked down the hallway into my family room.  The drone craft moved silently toward the spot where I was just standing.  I began to observe the motion of this craft.  It was spinning silently counterclockwise.  I said to myself, it looks like an old-fashioned top.  It had a long grayish, granite looking cylinder at the bottom with notches at the end.  The color of the drone craft was a burnt brown color, almost like an amber color.  There were gold tones with light glowing from inside.  Each rib on the top had a formation of what appeared to be hexagon or honeycomb shape.  The very top had a grayish or charcoal surface.  Since I was in the family room, I panicked and realized I was trapped.  The funny thing was I walked back into the hallway and got down low to go under this drone craft and it moved out of the way. The drone craft appeared to be looking inside my house.  Looking in the living room, the bathroom and then into the family room.  I went to look for a camera, but when I came back.  It was gone.  I never knew this site existed and after looking in sitings in Illinois, it appears nothing like this was ever reported before.  This is an incident I will never forget.

UFO flying fluently over Deja Brew in Oak Lawn, Illinois.;2016-04-14 22:16:00;5-8 seconds;UFO flying fluently over Deja Brew in Oak Lawn, Illinois. It went about 800MPH.  It was diagonal/as it was moving.  It looked to have odd looking lights that look sorta halogen with about 3 to 5 lights in a diagonal formation.  It moved super fluently through the clear sky.  It made no sound and semi big.  It was not too night or too low in the sky.  I was walking in the back parking lot coming out of Deja Brew.  It headed towards like Richards High School.  This was for sure nothing I would think that was made on earth.  It was awesome.  There would have been no time to catch it on camera unless there are any cameras pointed up in the sky somewhere in Oak Lawn at about 10:16PM.  The sky was perfectly clear and about 60 degrees.  I will be on high alert watching the sky tonight.  There was other aircraft in the sky at the time. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
