Light buld like candle - Goverment?;2007-06-10 23:00:00;1 min;Light buld like candle - Goverment? I was outside with my friends younger brother and he saw something when we were in my back yard. He says hey look at that. I looked and it almost looked like to me a shadow like u.f.o but it was a balloon. 20 minutes later he goes whats that in the sky and it looked like a candle like light bulb going as fast as a balloon floating in the sky we saw ealier and was very,very high in the sky. I like what is that, I was looking trying to get what ever it was attention saying stop and trees were blocking the view when my camera phone was focusing. Tree ending up blocking my view. So could not take picture. All the sudden my friend said it's only a plane and I was looking I am like thats no plane I started scream stop,come over here, and then tree blocked the view and then I went in my front yard and I was like holy cow it was still moving I still had my cellphone and tried to take another picture and it was a open view no trees this time to block the view. Then it looked like it slightly bursted when it hit a light shaded cloud. My friend was like did you see that I never saw anything like that. Then I siad lets wait here it might be back. Then my friend said forget about it it's gone. I reported stuff I saw in the past. What I think what this stuff is are goverment experiments or Holograms. If it was really a U.F.O. I think it was following the balloon like it was studying it. I took a picture of the cloud it hit. Like as if maybe there a vortex to bring the light back to the dimmension it came from. I think it noticed that I was gonna try to take a picture of it so it burst once it hit cloud. I saw a shadowman with snake tongue in the past. I saw a 1950's type U.F.O. before. I saw liquid moving all around the sky. I am sick of seeing this stuff. Everyone I tell don't beleive what i saw. I saw other minor stuff also. When the goverment gonna stop with this. I know I am not crazy. I am just gonna blame it on the goverment. Lots of people report this stuff all the time. I was scared a little t! hinking once that light burst like that is that they went to land somewhere. I saw a movie called Night skies 4 weeks ago what gave me that idea.;41.7123999999999;-87.7478000000001

4 slow lights across sky than one really fast one 5 minutes apart;2007-07-14 11:00:00;25 minutes;4 slow lights across sky than one really fast one 5 minutes apart I saw 5 dots like lights really high in the sky and some type of light flashing in background. Every 5 minutes a new one would appear. I saw one go over the sky at a slow speed - 5 minutes later I saw another one moving at same speed. 5 minutes later I saw another one on other side of sky this time moving still the same speed. 5 minutes later I see another one back in the same place I saw the first 2. 5 minutes later this time one going superfast me and my witness saw all 5 of them. Then it started to turn slighly cloudy. I was amazed of what I saw. Must of been all satalites maybe. Kinda reminded me of 4 crafts looking for something while i was seeing flashes in background like as if an alien was trying to signal the lights in the sky with some kinda flsh. Then the 5 light seemed to me to be like a Police ufo when it went full speed. I was laughing saying I bet cops in space is whats going on right now and they can't find the alien flashed I think a blue light on earth soil not to far from where i was at.

Fast Moving Dim light Filmed going Past Bright Star;2010-08-13 04:52:00;2 minutes;Fast Moving Dim light Filmed going Past Bright Star I was trying to see if I can see a Meator Shower and saw an dim light object coming at a fast speed 900 miles per hour. I pulled my Cellphone Camera out that was seeing to get a little light in background so it would show up on camera and luckilty it was past the the brightest star in the sky.  As I was unzooming my camera from the setting I had it on when the cellphone camera was in my hands I was using a Sony Ericsson C905a Cellphone Camera.  As I was filming it went past I said Here comes a Fast one.  Than I said It's coming faster this time. Than I said as I was unzooming I said Right Past this Star. Than I said It's going right past this star Right now. Than I said shouting there it is I got it on Camera.  Than said I got it. Than I said I got you on Camera boy.  Than I said hows it going dude. Than I said Yeah. Than I said in a studdering voice it got to be a UFO.  Than I said this is not than shockingly said ohhh a Meatorite just fell down that i wish I wou! ld of got that on camera. After that the camera shuts off after 47 seconds. I caught 27 seconds on film. The 20 seconds was me getting the camera out of zoom and waiting for it to come towards a better light source that big star in the sky. There was a some what alot of shacking in the camera footage while filming. The object was half the size of the star. The Star was 85 percent brighter than the object that was moving fast. The footage was taped at 4:52 AM. Footage is hard to see it but i have good contact lenses and can see good clearly. The Bad News is when I try to send this footage named MOV00025 to my email like I do with all my videos it says when I try to send the Cellphone is reading (Cannot add Video. Message will be to Large.) File Size is only 1.4MB and that should be able to send from my Cellphone to my Email.  The video is stored in my Phone Memory as MP4 just like all my other camera footage. Why is this too large when at 5 Am I am filming another one or the ! same one that is 2.7 MB and that one will send but not worth s! ending. Why is 1.4MB to large to send and 2.7MB is ok to send from Camera phone that don't make sense I think what I was filming sent me a Virus?  I have a AVS Editor I wanted to use to edit the cellphone camera footage file so I can gett a better view on my Windows XP Computer. The transfer file area does not work with the USB 2.0 plug my Cellphone came with the software for transfer says for windows XP says can't be added to this computer when uploaded the software my cellphone came with. Sending to Video DJ on Cellphone don't work  Either. Next try to send it to a memory Card once I order one if that will work.  Well anyways the ufo made no sound and over my head in a 360 direction past the sun over parents house as I was on the front sidewalk and saw it for almost 2 minutes until it was too far to see.  Than at 5 oclock it might of been back again it was about 6 blocks away coming back in the background in my back yard. I was flash the camera light at it trying to communicate with it.

It had no blinking lights like all the other planes in the sky knowing I am miles away from Midway Airport.  It happened around 5:24am knowing it's a good chance to tape the stuff as the sun is starting to come up I went outside and then ended up right away seeing this.  The ending of the video was the best because 4 minutes later it even gotton lighter outside and was the closest I have filmed of the object.

((HOAX??))  I bet it was that Chupacabra from the 80's that I saw flying this want to be Dish UFO;2010-10-31 18:06:00;6 minutes;I bet it was that Chupacabra from the 80's that I saw flying this want to be Dish UFO Went outside to the garbage to throw away garbage and saw a light thinking an bright star. The star looking to be moving but was not sure.  But it was moving.  Then was far from distance coming towards moving slow. As I was watching I called someone to come outside and see this light in the distance. They told me there doing something and I told them to hurry up. I watched it slowing getting closer. Thinking at times it looks like the light is sun gleaming on the object or is it a orb or something. Told them hurry up get out here now before you miss it looking sorta high in sky or not no chinese lantern. Then witness who i been saying get outhere comes out side as the light got closer and said something like it might be a Dish I don't think it's a plane no sound. Then a blinking plane flew past it above it the light then got out of seeing range for about 10 seconds. Then got over and see it again go past us and notices a very small tiny dot behind it blink onc! e evey 10 seconds but my witness could not see what I was saying. No sound,no blinking light in front but may have blinking light in back that blinks every 10 seconds that you can barely even see. Witness say he could not see the blink that I was talking about. It kept down 99th street sorta. It was getting dimmer the farther it was going as I could see other planes lights clearly as the planes were father than this light. It was around 8:06 to 8:12pm. It was dark around I think 6:30pm so think maybe the sun was glaring on object. But behind the object as it was going past has a very slow blink light on it. I don't think Dishes have a Blink light on it? Witness think its was a dish with a blink light behind it. It was no Jet,or no plane. Oak Lawn i seen stuff in past. Weird because I was just reading about Betty and Barny the ones who got abducted story. I saw the back of light blink very lightly every 10 seconds as it was passing after around 4 mintues and 35 seconds but t! he witness could not see that. I see stuff like weird simmular! before but behind object light had maybe a beacon blink really slow that blends in too much with the sunlight glare. Moved in a 33 degree anlge going straight. Just kidding why would that Chupacabra from the 80's want to come back to boring Oak Lawn. Happy Halloween.

Two Fake Stars During October 8th 2014 Lunar Eclipse;2014-10-08 05:55:00;25 seconds;Two Fake Stars During October 8th 2014 Lunar Eclipse I was looking at the lunar eclipse. I took my attention off the lunar eclipse.  I started looking at the stars at 5:55AM for a moment.  I notice 2 identical stars looking like they were both moving as small thin clouds were moving past them both.  The stars were both on the other side of the sky far away from the lunar eclipse.  The clouds were moving past in front of them at a medium speed.  They both suddenly diminished as the clouds finally past by in front of them both.  All the other stars were still there till I went inside at 6:17AM. I noticed them both there for 25 seconds and they could of have been there for a longer time then the time I noticed them both there.  The sky was clear to the left of the diminishing stars as if those were the last clouds to pass. They were not stars.  They actually may both weren't moving and the clouds moving made it look like they were.  They were trying to pretend like stars and were UFO's that looked exactly like 2 stars.  I will never forget this happened. There was a helicopter around the area at the time and was flying around maybe because of a car accident in Crestwood next to Oak Lawn.  I don't trust stars after this happened.   They diminished after I noticed them and know they probably knew to leave before I took a picture or filmed with my windows cellphone. They were intelligent to disappear like that.  I am not surprised that this happened.  I use to things like this happening.  They made no sound.  All I could hear was a helicopter in the background.

I tried to call about an hour ago to report this and I got an answering machine so I hung up.  I saw this at 5:45AM.  I went to move my car out of the driveway so my dad can get out of the driveway with his car so he can go to work.  He left and I moved my car back in the driveway.   I got out of my car that was parked in front of the front door of the house and I looked at the sky and I saw 2 bright lights close to each other that look like identical stars.  I was looking at them for about 10 seconds.   I knew I saw this happen to me before I walked fast in my house with snowy boots on to get my Windows phone so I could film it.  I was walking fast back outside 12 seconds later with camera ready to film and I knew they would be both gone.   I reported this before when there was the lunar eclipse a couple months ago.  I am sorta in shock and a little worried knowing that it's back again.  I think it won't be the last time I see it.

I saw a low flying object coming towards me with sunlight glaring off of it when I was driving on 95th St today at 4:42PM.  I got stopped by a traffic red light and all the sudden the Oak Park Ave (Green Street Sign) was blocking my view of that low object flying.   The traffic light then turned green 10-15 seconds later I continued to drive again so that street sign wouldn't be blocking my view anymore and it wasn't there anymore when it definitely should of still have been there to even see it twice as better.   I got out of Wendy's Drive thru at 4:52PM and I ordered a Son of Bacconattor.   A visible satellite I also saw did the same sorta thing in the area but was way higher in the sky and was way smaller flying at 4:57PM when I driving towards Kean Ave on 95th St. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

I was getting ready to text him to see what was going on and if he was still planning on going.  I looked around at the clear sky and the way the stars looked so beautiful tonight that was very unusual lately until that day a few days ago.  I then noticed one star brightening up.  I thought that might be them again but ther're not identical this time.  I tried to get my camera on my cellphone ready but I knew it was too late when the one bright star was dimming down as a tiny blinking light on a plane was coming towards it.  Then both stars disappeared simultaneously.   They never came back as clouds covering the entire sky were moving in towards that area at 11:39 P.M.   Someone else told me they and others saw something simular on July 3rd at night.  This person told me this happened on July 6th in Hodgkins, Illinois.

I thought I would share but wasn't sure if it was a UFO.;2015-10-22 00:31:00;3 minutes;I thought I would share but wasn't sure if it was a UFO. I was moving cars in the driveway when I noticed it between 2 trees. It changed different shapes from saucer shape to circle shape.  It was as big as a moon. I couldn't locate the moon that night. I do see aircraft flying in the area almost everyday between those 2 trees.  This object was not moving.  I have never seen the moon ever between those 2 trees in my whole life. It was changing shape and disappeared. It then reappeared so I took my camera out and took 4 photos of the object.  It then disappeared and took 2 more photos of the area it was located.  My only explanation was that maybe a very thin cloud that I could barely see had frozen water inside the cloud and the moon that I could not locate was glaring moon light off of it.  There wasn't any wind almost and maybe the wind was moving about 12 MPH.  The reason why I think it wasn't frozen water in a thin cloud was why would it form a perfect circle. I did also take a photo of a aircraft flying in that direction near it.  I never see aircraft flying in that direction in that location in the sky.  I waited about 15 minutes outside to see if it would come back but clouds that where coming in ended up covering the whole sky.  I was gonna take a drive to see if I can locate the moon but the clouds came in super thick.  I have photos of it changing shape in a video on Youtube. I titled it UFO October 22, 2015 Oak Lawn Illinois. I titled it that but maybe shouldn't of because I wasn't sure if it really was a UFO. It was very quiet on the rhodes at 12:31 midnight having maybe only seen 1 to 3 cars drive down the street between 12:27 midnight to 12:52 midnight. It was hours after the Chicago Cubs got eliminated from the playoffs. If it happened 32 minutes earlier it would have still have been Marty Mcfly day. I would send photos but I'm not sure what email you all have to send them too. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

I was driving from 111th & Cicero to 103rd & Cicero in Oak Lawn.  While I was driving I saw a white light coming down Cicero that looked like the ISS.  It had no blinking lights. I watched it and the red traffic light too at around 107th & Cicero it was moving at about the Sam speed as the other planes in the sky.  At one time I thought it wad a star because it looked to be not moving.  It went over head I stuck my head out window it had 2 white lights close to each other.  I did not hear any sound from it going over head.  It was weird.  If it was a plane they didn't have any blinking lights on.  It was just flying over the street Cicero going down it like it was interested in the cars going down the street.

Not a satellite.  ((anonymous report));2017-05-28 21:50:00;27 seconds;Not a satellite. I looked it up if it was a satellite and none were flying by at the time I saw this.  It moved about twice as fast as the ISS that I usually see.   I looked up that the ISS flew by at around 8:49PM according to a website that it would be flying by in my town when I typed in my zip code 60453.  This object that was no satellite flew by at 9:50PM.   It was slowly pulsating every 2 to 4 seconds for the first 12 seconds then it stopped then the last 15 seconds it would get bright and sometimes the brightness faded a little.   It flew almost over head.   One witness I was with would barely want to look at it when I was telling them to look at it.  They did say the saw for a second.   They told me it was white and was maybe space junk. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of the report elects to remain anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));41.7123999999999;-87.7478000000001
