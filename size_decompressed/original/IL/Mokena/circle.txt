3 red orbs in Mokena, Illinois heading towards Tinley Park.;2009-03-16 20:00:00;15 minutes;3 red orbs in Mokena, Illinois heading towards Tinley Park. There were three bright red lights that flew together in a triangle. They were not airplanes, as they were much larger and would move much faster than airplanes. They also hovered in midair and flew in directions airplanes couldn't. Every once in a while, one orb would shimmer a bit, and then stop and another one would shimmer, and finally the other would shimmer. Almost as if to communicate with each other. They flew in a triangle but would frequently form a straight line and then form back into a triangle again. During the final five minutes, they were drifting away from us, and one on the left flew very fast off to the side, away from the others. Then one of the two left flew off to the right very fast. The final orb got brighter and brighter as if to be coming towards us. Then all of a sudden it disappeared. the lights were suddenly turned off and the three orbs were gone. The two orbs that flew to either side, also disappeared in the same fashion soon after leaving the triangle.  I used to be a sceptic. Not that there were no aliens, but I was sceptical that they would enter our atmosphere. After this sighting, i now have no doubts that what i saw were not airplanes. And i highly doubt they are man made.;41.5335;-87.8931000000001
White/yellow spheres sited in the night sky,;2012-05-26 21:00:00;15-20 minutes;white/yellow spheres sited in the night sky, Objects were round, bright yellow/white...with a redish glow around the outer ring. Large in size, much larger than a plane or satelite.  They traveled from the east to west, moving fairly quickly. We saw them individual as well as grouped in 2 or 3.  Strangely, there was a black round object moving with 2 others at one point. the black object was same shape (round) and same size.  It moved in the same direction and at the same speed.  Entire episode lasted about 15-20 minutes,;41.5335;-87.8931000000001
Dark orange fireball settles in the west.;2015-08-13 21:00:00;30 seconds;Dark orange fireball settles in the west Very dark orange almost red ball hovered slowly in the west sky while we sat by the fire.  We were looking west all evening, and then out of nowhere a orange glow appeared. My exact words were I hope a plane didn't just catch on fire in the air   The thing slowly settled over the tree line. No clue what it was but it was NOT normal.
