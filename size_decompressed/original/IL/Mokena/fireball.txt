Ball of fire floating in the air.;2011-07-16 21:00:00;20 min;Ball of fire floating in the air. It looked like a big fireball,moving very slowly from the north to south.  We all observed it. It looked like orange  red.  It did go up and down.  At first we thought it was a plane on fire,when it came down a little bit we thought the plane was falling from the sky.  But it then went back up and kept a steady pattern.;41.5335;-87.8931000000001
