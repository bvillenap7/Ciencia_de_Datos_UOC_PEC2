My husband and I saw a egg shaped object going from north to south appox. 6 P.M. on Sunday evening. It was flying at the same altitude as a small plane. It did not make any noise and was reflecting the sun, so it was a golden color. It did not resemble a plane, a balloon or a bird. We have never seen anything like this in the sky. We both looked at each other at the same time and had the same thought. A UFO. Neither my husband nor myself have ever seen anything like this before nor have we ever used this sight. My husband is a safety salesman and I am a Sales manager at a major department store in the Chicago market.;41.5335;-87.8931000000001
