there were three red lights and they dissapeared and appeared in different spots.;2004-10-31 03:00:00;?;there were three red lights and they dissapeared and appeared in different spots. I just got to my friends house in Mokena, IL I cant remember what exact time it was, probably 2-4:00 a.m.  We got out of the car and decided to look at a cluster of stars we never noticed before. All of a sudden red lights appeared and dissapeared. They moved to different spots after they dissapeared. I don't remember how long we watched this for, we had time to go and get our other friend to show him.  We talk to alot of others that seen the same as us at the same time range. they were in frankfort and mokena.;41.5335;-87.8931000000001

Saw three red lights form a massive triangle. Looked like it was over in the next town (Tinley Park). Sky was overcast.

While waiting in my vehicle at my daughter's bus stop in -4 degree weather, we both witnessed a very large object in the northern part;2008-01-23 06:30:00;3 minutes;While waiting in my vehicle at my daughter's bus stop in -4 degree weather, we both witnessed a very large object in the northern part of the sky.  It appeared to be about 4 times the size of a 737 plane, as compared at equal distance.   It was still fairly dark outside so the object appeared to be extremely bright and white against the dark sky.  It was somewhat triangular in shape with rounded corners.  The object never moved in a horizontal manner.  After watching it remain still for about 2 minutes, the object slowly moved straight upwards until I lost sight of it from my vehicle.;41.5335;-87.8931000000001
We saw 3 red lights over the sky near Tinley Park.;2009-03-16 20:00:00;10 minutes;We saw 3 red lights over the sky near Tinley Park. My mom and I were driving home and as we were about to pull up on our driveway in Mokena, we looked up in the sky and saw the 3 red lights in a triangle.  They were in mid-sky, south-east of our house, in the Tinley Park direction. We jumped out of our car and stood in the street to see them better.  We called our neighbors immediately, when we noticed the lights, and 2 of them joined us, as well as my sister.  Our neighbors called their brother, who was at a different location, and he saw them as well.  The lights shifted to near the horizon line, but were clearly red, not blinking, and in a triangle position. We crossed the street and stood on the bleachers at Grasmere Park to see them better, since they were now lower in the sky.  The lights moved into a straight line at one point, then moved back into a triangle.  After a few minutes, one light began to move away to the left (west).  The other 2 stayed in position but moved further away until they were out of sight.  Also, another guy in our neighborhood walked over and saw them when they were on the horizon.  These lights were very similar to the ones we saw in August 2004, but they did not stay in the sky as long. We did try to take a photo from my sister's camera, but she couldn't zoom in close enough. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he seemed to us to be quite serious-minded, and quite credible.  PD));41.5335;-87.8931000000001
We saw three red lights, in a triangle, in Mokena IL;2009-03-16 20:00:00;10 minutes;We saw three red lights, in a triangle, in Mokena IL There were three red dots in the sky. This was in Mokena, Illinois, heading southeast away from Tinley Park. They were moving in a triangle then to a straight line. I saw the same thing in August 2004 a little over four years ago. It was just like it had been. They were nothing like airplanes they were far away and moving fast. They were together in a triangle then went to a straight line, back to a triangle. The one started moving away from the other two. It was like nothing I had ever seen before. I watched the UFO Hunters season opener- about the Illinois invasion. The Tinley Park phenomenon featured these lights.  I watched it three times. Right when I saw the lights it reminded me of that. It was NOT a hoax.  Nobody could stage that. I still can’t believe they were back.  They were flying the same path they did in 2004.  The UFOs flew right over us heading in a southeastern direction. My neighbors (who also sent you a report) were out there watching it with me.  They were the ones that told me to come outside and they said the UFOs are back!   There were seven witnesses and we all saw the three red moving lights. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates a date in 2008.  We have amended the date to reflect the event that occurred over that city on March 16, 2009.  Please see other reports.  PD));41.5335;-87.8931000000001
I saw 5 red, quick moving craft  in formation before disappearing.;2010-07-15 17:00:00;2 minutes;I saw 5 red, quick moving craft  in formation before disappearing. I worked at a local restaurant in Mokena.  I was in charge of cleaning and closing up the store.  It was getting close to closing time when I went out back to take out the garbage.   On my way back into the store I saw 3 strange red lights flying north above LaGrange road.   At first, I thought it was one giant craft in the shape of a triangle.  But I waited for the formation to pass under some stars, and when the stars didn’t black out like I had expected, I realized that it was 3 craft flying synchronized in a triangle formation.  I knew what I was seeing because I’d seen the videos before and watched some UFO documentaries.  I may not necessarily believe in aliens, but I knew what I was seeing was unexplained.  I immediately ran inside to grab any witness I could.  I was shouting, “Hurry, It’s a UFO come on!  It’s those ones you see on TV!”  Only my co-worker ((male name deleted)) came out to see. He recognized the formation too and tried to record it on his iPhone, but it was dark and! nothing showed up on the video.   Another co-worker of ours came out too, but by then 2 of the 3 red lights had faded away, so it didn’t seem like anything extraordinary to him.   I resumed closing up the store.  I was quite shaken up and even told some customers about what I had seen.   About 15 minutes later, I was outside again taking more garbage out, when I saw 2 more red.  These 2 lights weren’t flying in any formation and they were flying much faster than the first 3 I had seen.  They were traveling the same route:  North up LaGrange road curving East over I-80.  It seemed as though the 2 were trying to catch up to the other 3 lights.   Before I went home, I stopped at the BP gas station located at LaGrange and 191st st.  There were to Mokena police officers in there, and I was so shocked by what I had seen, I even had the nerve to ask the police officers if they had heard about any UFO sightings, at the risk of sounding crazy. They didn’t hear anything and I did get the feeling they thought I was crazy.   I later found out that there happened to be multiple famous UFO sightings really close by in Tinley Park.   I’m only now reporting this because I had recently been watching a documentary that put a few more pieces together for me, and I hope this information may be able to do the same for someone else.
