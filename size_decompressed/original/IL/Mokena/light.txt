Steady Red/Orange light very bright until it went into cloud cover and faded from view;2011-09-09 23:05:00;20 sec;Steady Red/Orange light very bright until it went into cloud cover and faded from view As I left a restaurant in Mokena going to my car in the lot at 11:05 PM , I looked up and saw a light in the sky. It was very bright and was reddish orange in color. It was a steady light it did not blink. I asked two people standing there what they thought it was and neither could explain it. We watched as the light traveled westward in the sky The light began to fade a little and it appeared to be going into the clouds. It was not a commercial jet or plane because those lights blink and this one did not. It seemed to enter the cloud and thus become blocked from our view. I don't know it's altitude but it was in the clouds so it was pretty high up there. I'd only have to guess at it's size because I don't know how far away it was. It was also so bright (at first) that it could be quite small and very luminescent. In other words I couldn't tell it's shape just that it was very bright. It traveled into the cloud cover and again I'd have to guess it's speed. I! t seemed to be almost stationary at first but as it went up ( I presume) and west into the cloud it seemed to go faster. Without a point of reference it's hard to distinguish speed and size and distance. When I got home some 40 minutes later the clouds had started to break up a bit. The moon is now visible but it is much further south in the sky to have been involved with this sighting. ( it was not the moon showing through the clouds). It was not Jupiter which is in the eastern sky. It is unidentified. I was working at the restaurant that night and did not have a single drop of alcohol. I am not a UFO enthusiast and do not make reports unless I can't explain what I saw.;41.5335;-87.8931000000001
Five bright lights not in formation seemed to be flying quickly that disappeared within 20 seconds.;2014-02-25 17:58:00;~20 seconds;Five bright lights not in formation seemed to be flying quickly that disappeared within 20 seconds. I was driving down 191st Street going East between Rt. 45 and Harlem Avenue when I had seen 5 lights in the distance which would be in the next city (Matteson) from the look of where they were in the air.  They were very bright although not flying in formation, but flying near each other at a distance of maybe a 1/8th of a mile or so between each.   Again, no formation as they were spread across a slightly wide distance of maybe 3/4 mile to a mile across.   The sky was bright in between so they were separate entities.   By the time I had gotten to the next cross street (80th Ave),   I could no longer see them which makes me think they were flying very fast.  They seemed to all be white. I tried to take a picture, but didn't turn out.;41.5335;-87.8931000000001
