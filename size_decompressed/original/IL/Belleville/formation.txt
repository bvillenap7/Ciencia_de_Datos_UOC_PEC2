3-4 orange lighted over belleville.;2012-12-05 22:50:00;5 minutes;3-4 orange lighted over belleville I was outside with my wife around 10:55 pm talking. I looked up and saw three to four orange yellow lights traveling south west.  The did not blink or hover, but continued to move and change direction and formation, although to my wife it looked like one craft turning.  I live next to an air base but didn't hear any noise from the craft.  I did see an airplane after the objects disappeared, but it was much further away.;38.5331457031249;-89.9956175781251
