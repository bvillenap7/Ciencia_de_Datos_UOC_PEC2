WHILE WATCHING MOVIE AT DRIVE-IN THEATER, THE ENTIRE AREA LIT UP FOR SEVERAL SECONDS WITH A BLUE-GREEN LIGHT.;1997-07-04 21:00:00;3-5 seconds;Summary : WHILE WATCHING MOVIE AT DRIVE-IN THEATER, THE ENTIRE AREA LIT UP FOR SEVERAL SECONDS WITH A BLUE-GREEN LIGHT. I WAS WITH MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER WATCHING A MOVIE AT THE SKYVIEW DRIVE-IN THEATER.   ABOUT 15-20 MINUTES INTO THE MOVIE THE ENTIRE AREA WAS LIT BY A VERY BRIGHT BLUE-GREEN LIGHT FOR 3-5 SECONDS.   AFTER THE LIGHT WAS GONE I LOOKED OUTSIDE THE CAR, BUT DID NOT SEE ANYTHING ELSE.  BEING THE FOURTH OF JULY, I PRESUMED IT WAS SOME SORT OF FIREWORKS.  HOWEVER, THERE WAS NO SOUND ASSOCIATED WITH THE LIGHT.  THE DRIVE-IN WAS ALMOST FULL WITH APPROXIMATELY 100-150 CARS.;38.5331457031249;-89.9956175781251
Royal Blue light moving very fast, east to west almost directly overhead. Small teardrop shape.;1997-07-04 21:30:00;seconds;Summary : Royal Blue light moving very fast, east to west almost directly overhead. Small teardrop shape. While watching 4th of July fireworks display (from Belleville Area College), the royal blue light was observed directly overhead on an east to west heading (parallel to IL Route 161).   Sighting was about 3.5 mile SW of Scott AFB IL.  Object was moving very fast and had no real shpe that could be noted, if anything teardrop with a white sparkling contrail.   The object was NOT in the area or vacinity of any fireworks being displayed and was potentially observed by thousands of individuals watching the fireworks.   I offer the number of observers as 2+ as a neighbor and I were talking as we both saw the other than fireworks light.;38.5331457031249;-89.9956175781251
Brite White Light  in Southwest Sky Near STL.;2008-06-05 22:32:00;30 seconds;Brite White Light  in Southwest Sky Near STL. Thursday June 05, 2008 Belleville, Illinois 10:32pm  I was out on my back patio looking South up at the clear evening sky.  From my West out of the corner of my eye I saw a brite white light off in the distance, at first I thought it was a high flying aircraft.  But as the light approached from the West, the object was much higher in altitude then I originally thought, almost like looking at a satellite passing over but much brighter and faster.  I thought it might be the ISS passing over the house, but as the brite white object was just about directly over me the light dimmed quickly and dissapeared.  I waited a few minutes looking to see if the object would reappear down range on it's path but it did not, the lighted object just dissapeared?  The object made no sounds and had no other lights.;38.5331457031249;-89.9956175781251

Witness went to the kitchen and from my patio doors saw two pulsating, strobe like lights in the Eastern sky.  The lights flashed red and white and were above the tree line.  The lights came closer growing in size and hovered side by side.  The one on the left moved away from the other light and the lights of both objects pulsed faster and brighter.  Then the light on the right went to the East and witness watched until it was out of sight.  The other light went south and was observed to move fast across the sky until it was out of sight.  Neither one diverted from its path, in other words they moved straight in a path.  Witness first thought of the lights that flashed on high towers but realized there are no towers there.  Witness thought it might be a reflection but there was nothing in the house behind that was lighting up and there were no windows behind witness.  The lights reminded witness of strobe lights as they were pulsating very fast.  They were too large an! d too bright to be airplane lights and moved much faster.  Witness lives near an Air-Force base and an airport so observes airplanes, jets, and helicopters on an hourly basis.  The only thought was that it might have been large drones.;38.5331457031249;-89.9956175781251

We went outside to see what was happening and we saw the first helicopter flying south.  Then a a 2nd helicopter was spotted to our west at about 1500'.  It was also flying south. We stood outside for a minute watching the 2nd helicopter and looking across the sky to see what they were following.  That is when  an overhead star I was directly looking at started to move.  It was much higher than the two helicopters and it started flying south too, but then turned up into the sky and disappeared into the distance.;38.5331457031249;-89.9956175781251
