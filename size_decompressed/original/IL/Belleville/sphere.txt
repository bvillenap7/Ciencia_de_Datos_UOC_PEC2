Multi-colored lights/in my bedroom/child;1982-06-30 00:00:00;Not sure;multi colored lights/in my bedroom/child I was a young child, aged maybe 5/6 years old.  I woke to bright colorful lights flashing outside my window, then in through my window and all across my room.  I sat straight up in my bed clutching my stuffed bunny, terrified!  I watched as my bedroom window slowly started to lift.  Two beings stuck their heads inside my window.  I was terrified.  I opened my mouth to scream and ABSOLUTELY NO SOUND CAME OUT – AND I couldn’t move a muscle in my body.  Immobile and screaming bloody murder (only in my head as no sounds were coming out) these creatures one by one crept into my bed room, surrounded me, removed the bunny from my arms and tossed it across the room.  I suppose there was about 5 of them.  Hindsight, they were very gentle and almost seemed to want to calm me.  I completely blacked out, and when woke up it was morning and I was covered in sweat and tears.  My bunny was across the room where he had tossed it!   Of course I was told it was just a dream, and for years I believed it.  Now being an adult, and with the memories and images still so strong and vivid I know it so be real.  I always question why I was chosen, if I have a job to do here on earth, and most importantly if they will ever visit me again.;38.5331457031249;-89.9956175781251
