I stepped onto my back deck like I do every night before turning in for the night, I looked in the sky and noticed that the sky has cleared after being cloudy all day, crystal clear.  And just then out of the eastern sky an object appeared, dull white almost starlike in appearance crossed over my house at speed.  It traveled from east to west and made 1 manuver, right to left before dissaperaing into the western sky toward St. Louis.  This object left no con trailor sound, and traveled much fastern than any jet or plane and it seemed low in alltitude compaired to normal aircraft flight patterns around my house.  space junk, meteroite I have seen both, and I dont know what this was!;38.5331457031249;-89.9956175781251

The object had an oddly-shaped base that was not symmetrical, and a long neck with a kind of sweet-potato shape at the tip. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.
