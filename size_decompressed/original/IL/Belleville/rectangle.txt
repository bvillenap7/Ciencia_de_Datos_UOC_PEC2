Very fast rectangular shape craft.;2015-11-13 21:30:00;6-8 seconds;Very fast rectangular shape craft. November 13th, 930pm. It was a crystal clear evening with very little moonlight. I was standing out on my deck looking at the stars as I often do.  Something caught my eye to the West. At first I thought it was a satellite.  This was very high altitude. I then noticed that there were two soft glowing lights, one on each end of a rectangular shape.  The shape had a slight curve toward the middle of both the front and back.  It was traveling North to South. It also seemed to have a swirling bluish green glow moving in a random pattern all over the shape. I have viewed many satellites, the ISS and aircraft of all kinds. I have never seen anything moving this quickly across the sky.  I would guess on average, a satellite would take 45 seconds to a minute to cross through my vision of sight.  This object covered that same distance in 6-8 seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));38.5331457031249;-89.9956175781251
