Large triangular UFO sighting near Belleville, IL;2008-11-02 20:00:00;30-45 seconds;Large triangular UFO sighting near Belleville, IL My boyfriend and I were driving on I-64 near Belleville, IL on our way to St. Charles, MO.  We noticed a bright light through the trees in a field to the right of the interstate about 200 yards away.  At first we thought it was a large helicopter but when we got closer we noticed the object was very large, and in a triangular or arrowhead shape with 3 bright lights at each corner.  It also had small lights going around the sides, mostly white.  The object was hovering, as if suspended in midair, above the tree line, probably 150-200 feet off of the ground.  At first I thought it might be some kind of tower in the field, judging from its large size, low position, and the fact that it was completely still.  We also heard no noise, but we were driving.  However, as we drove by it, I watched in the rear window and the object began to move south very slowly, probably about 20 mph, over the interstate and disappeared over the trees.  Neither of us was sure what to think and I haven’t seen anything in the news today but I know others on the interstate with us must have seen the object too.  The object looked very similar to what was described in the Travel Channel special titled “UFO Over Illinois.”  Prior to this, my boyfriend did not believe in extraterrestrials or UFO’s but now claims to be a believer.  It was a very chilling experience.  I’m interested to see if anyone else reports seeing it too.;38.5331457031249;-89.9956175781251
