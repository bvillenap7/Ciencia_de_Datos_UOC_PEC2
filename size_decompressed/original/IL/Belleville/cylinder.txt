Againt blue object in the sky gets chased away by 2 planes.;2002-02-22 23:00:00;15 minutes;Againt blue object in the sky gets chased away by 2 planes. My Girlfriend and I were going home from a movie, when we saw a cylinder or circler object in the sky. The object was right ahead of my car. The object kept getting bigger and more blue. We got up to a stop light and the people next to us were looking at it. Then all of the sudden it drop down in the sky then slowly faded off. Like the light kept getting dimmer and then it shot across the sky. We were pretty freaked out. We thought we saw it again but to military jets when flying over our head. The planes were going in the direction of were the object went. ((NUFORC Note:  We will request a report from the other student.  PD));38.5331457031249;-89.9956175781251
