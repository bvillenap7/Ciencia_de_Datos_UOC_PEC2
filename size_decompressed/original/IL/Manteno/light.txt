Amber orbs moving from East to West and them disappearing.;2014-07-03 21:00:00;30 minutes;Amber orbs moving from East to West and them disappearing. Seen amber orbs light up in the Eastern sky.  Moving fast they would get bright and then disappear.  This happened several times for about half hour.  One made a sharp turn to the South.  Was watching fireworks at the time.   Orbs appeared to the North of the display. Neighbors seen them also.  Called my grandson in Normal, Il. and he seen two around the same time.;41.2535;-87.8474

((anonymous report));2019-08-27 19:22:00;<1 minute;I was driving south on Route 50 and there was a beautiful sunset, so I turned west on 1100 road to take a picture.  I parked just before the railroad tracks and took my first picture through the windshield of the car.  Thinking that the windshield might not be that clean, I took 2 more free hand with my arm hanging out the window.   Upon inspection I noticed an Orb that must of shot straight up and to the right in less than a minute.
