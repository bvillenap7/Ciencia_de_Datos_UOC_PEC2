Pinpoint of light with astonishing speed and unbelieveble direction change.;2002-02-09 01:19:00;10 seconds;Pinpoint of light with astonishing speed and unbelieveble direction change. I just went outside to smoke a cigarette and was thinking that the sky was very clear so I was checking out the beautiful winter sky when I noticed a point of light traveling from West to East.  At first I thought it was a satilite, but satilites do not move this fast.  The objest was covering ground at an amazing speed.  I still did not think much of it until the object made an abrupt 90 degree turn to the North unlike anything I have ever seen and then rocketed out of sight to the North.  I was totally freaked out.;38.6225;-89.5266
Pulsating line of lights.    ((Starlink satellites??));2020-02-28 05:00:00;10 minutes or less;The sky was clear of any clouds and the stars were very bright.  Looking in a southeast direction, I saw many lights moving in the same direction. The lights were consistently spaced in a straight line, one after another.  The only thing I can compare it to would be a pulsating line of lights or maybe lights moving along a conveyor belt.  The lights just appeared in one section of sky and then disappeared in another section of the sky (the length of the line in the sky was about the length of my hand). The pulsating continued for about five to ten minutes.  Then another single light moved downward perpendicular to the line of lights and then the line of lights stopped.;38.6225;-89.5266
