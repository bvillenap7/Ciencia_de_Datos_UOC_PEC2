3 stop signs flying in a triangular pattern;2002-11-22 22:00:00;45 sec;3 stop signs flying in a triangular pattern I was looking through my telescope at the moon when 3 ships crossed my line of site with the moon. When I refocused my telescope on the objects I saw that they were flying in a triangular pattern. They looked like thick black stop signs. The lead ship was flying very sporatically moving up and down and sided to side like it was survaying the ground. All three ships stayed very close to each other. When they past the moons light I lost them. I waited about an hour following the moons movement and sure enough they passed going in the opposite direction. I though maybe it might have been a satalite but I ruled that out when I saw them again in the opposite directions. They were moving fairly quick. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
