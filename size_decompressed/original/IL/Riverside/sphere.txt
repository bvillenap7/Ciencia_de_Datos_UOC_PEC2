Bright spere flying through the sky;2009-03-17 20:17:00;4 minutes;Bright spere flying through the sky to sum it up, the object was about as bright and big as venus was a few weeks ago moving through the sky. I thought it may have been an airplane but as it passed the brightness remained constant so I am sure it was not an airplane. There were no other lights just a bright blue-white spere very large and very high. It was not racing across the sky just moving at a moderate speed about as fast an airliner would fly by us being that we are close to ohare and midway airports. I was on the phone with my brother at the time who lives in the same town about a mile away and he could see it also.;41.8373;-87.8283
