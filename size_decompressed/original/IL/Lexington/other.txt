Sliver like objects grouped together traveling low altitude, changing bearing;2020-11-03 16:35:00;10 minutes;Sliver like objects grouped together traveling low altitude, changing bearing Driving on I-55 South-Southwest near Lexington, IL:  noticed 5-6 sliver like objects in sky, similar in appearance to exhaust trails from a jet airplane.  One in upper right quadrant of view, higher altitude than other 5.  After 3-4 minutes of watching the close one, noticed the location had not changed.  Other farther objects were all similar shape, but oriented in different rotations in respect to the ground.  Objects appeared slightly orange-white, with some amount of reflection from either setting sun or refracted light.  Estimated to be about 10,000-15,000 feet above ground at first sight, and around 10 miles out, moving in a very steady West-Northwest pace.  After 5 minutes, I exited to get on an East-West bearing country road, only one object remained, which had crossed from the North to the South of this road, but slowly getting farther away from field of vision.   At around 4:50, remaining object was gone from field of view, too far in the Southwest! sky.  Observer is a licensed architect with the state of Illinois, living in Chicago and traveling to visit Mother at time of sighting.  No previous observations of UFO sightings.;40.6321;-88.8042
