Very, very fast (5 times plane speed at least. On the evening of 12/13/12 at around 10:00pm I saw a light blue disk approach from the East, traveling West at what I would call the speed of a meteor.   It made a circular turn to the North and disappeared.   It was much too large to be a meteor and it made a circular right turn.;42.2636;-88.1333
