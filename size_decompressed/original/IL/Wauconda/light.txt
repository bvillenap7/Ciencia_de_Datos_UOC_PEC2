Brilliant glowing red object in northern Illinois moving from the northwest to the south.;2010-07-12 21:30:00;three minutes;Brilliant glowing red object in northern Illinois moving from the northwest to the south. Observed the object from a distance.  It was north by northwest of my location.  It intially appeared to be an aircraft running light.  But upon getting closer, I observed that the object was moving to the south in a straight (ballistic) manner.   It was red in color and very brilliant, but its color fluctuated.  I was then almost directly below it and it glowed a brilliant red color.  It was overcast, no stars were visible, so it was on my side of the cloud cover.   It then abruptly disappeared.;42.2636;-88.1333
