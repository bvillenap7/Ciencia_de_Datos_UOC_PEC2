Lighted sphere traveling in the night sky.;2019-08-30 05:08:00;5 seconds;Lighted sphere traveling in the night sky. On the morning of August 30, 2019, while traveling north on I-57 near the town of Metropolis, IL, I witnessed something in the night sky.  I saw a spherical object traveling at a high rate of speed from right to left (east to west).  The sphere seemed to emit its own light.  A silvery white light.   The movement was perfectly horizontal having no arc. The light was a constant level of brightness neither fading in or out.  The sphere was about three hundred feet in front and about one hundred fifty feet in elevation.  It appeared over the tree tops to the east.  Once the sphere had traveled very quickly across my field of vision and at my ten o'clock position, it suddenly disappeared.  It did not fade out but just vanished.  At arm's length the sphere was about as big as a shirt button. I first looked at my GPS to see if an airport was nearby, no airport.  I observed the time as 5:08am CST. I am a veteran truck driver and have seen many many shooting stars.  This was NOT a shooting star.  Its trajectory was perfectly linear with no arc or trail.  The intensity of light was a constant not fading in or out. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and we found him to be seemingly quite sober-minded and sincere.  We suspect that he is an excellent, and reliable, witness.  PD));37.1772;-88.723
