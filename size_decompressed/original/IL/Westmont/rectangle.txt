Reddish-gray rectangular object crossing sky, daytime sighting.;2008-11-25 15:05:00;15 to 20 seconds;Reddish-gray rectangular object crossing sky, daytime sighting. At approximately 15:05 on 11/25/08, I was on my way to work traveling East on 63rd Street between Fairview Avenue and Florence Drive in Westmont, Illinois.  I looked up and saw what I thought was a sign pulled behind an airplane.  It was rectangular, reddish-gray in color and moving slowly North to South about 40 to 45 degrees above the horizon.  I pulled out my cell phone to get a picture, while glancing up at the object.  It moved behind the large Westmont water tower on the South side of the road and never came back out.  As I drove further East on 63rd and came even with the water tower, I looked for the object as much as I could without having an accident, but it was gone.  The experience lasted approximately 15 to 20 seconds.  The weather was clear and sunny with some very sparse cloud cover.   I have never seen any kind of UFO before.;41.7723;-87.9796000000001
