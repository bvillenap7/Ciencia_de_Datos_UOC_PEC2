triangle craft seen over house in Westmont, IL;2007-09-20 19:15:00;3-4 min est;triangle craft seen over house in Westmont, IL I am reporting this for my wife as I was at a meeting.  She was on the phone sitting in a recliner and glanced out our bedroom window and noticed an object hovering over the next door neighbors house.  She said it was shaped like a triangle.  It had 3 lights on the bottom, 1 red light in the middle and 2 white lights, 1 on each end.  There were 2 more white lights located half way up, 1 on each side of the triangle.  She did not see the top of the craft because the top of our bedroom window blocked the rest of the craft, so there could have been a light at the top. The craft was fairly stationary over the roof.  It did move in an up and down pattern and did this for 3 to 4 minutes.  It slowing started moving east and went behind some trees and disappeared.  She said it could have been as big as a car or bigger.  She could not tell what the color was but seemed to have a reflective finish.  Sunset was around 6:52 pm and she guesses this was around 7:15 pm so it was already est. 70% dark.  It wasnâ€™t too dark as she could see the sky behind the craft.  The window was wide open and she did not hear any sound. At this time we do not know if any other neighbors observed this.  I will talk to the neighbors and see if anybody saw anything.  I will report if anyone else saw anything.;41.7723;-87.9796000000001
