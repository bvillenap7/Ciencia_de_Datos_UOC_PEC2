oval shaped huge object with orange running lights circling ship . moving very slow;1999-10-26 22:05:00;3 minutes;oval shaped huge object with orange running lights circling ship . moving very slow I was sitting down watching TV when my neighbor came knocking at the door and insisted that I come outside and look at what was in the air. When I went outside, i could not believe my eyes because it was so big and so bright that I kept telling myself, no this is not for real I was looking out toward the northwest from 31st  street and it was about 2 football fields big and looked like a blimp it was white and oval shaped with orange running lights circling around it and bright red and yellow lights around variuos parts of this object. I thought okay, the white sox are playing and a blimp is flying around but, the object was to low and I know they wouldn't allow a blimp to fly at night in the crowded aerospace around O'hara airport. It moved quite slow as if, it wanted to be seen. It was traveling toward the west. I also noticed that there was silence, as if you could hear a pin drop. I apologize for not reporting this as soon as it happened because my wife claims that it wasnt a UFO. We were living in a townhome off of 31st and Ogden Ave. in westmont ILL. at the time this event occurred.I was working for Worldcom at the time.She was working for Security Link. Plase note I have always believed that There are such things as UFO's but i have never in my life would have thought that I would one day be a witness to a sighting.;41.7723;-87.9796000000001
