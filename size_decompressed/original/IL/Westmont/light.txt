dim light moving verry fast and changing directions on a dot;2006-09-20 22:00:00;~1hr;dim light moving verry fast and changing directions on a dot there were dim lights moving ~4times faster than any plane in the sky, at first i thought it could be shooting star or a satellite but the light stoped for moments then changed directions on a dot. I only saw one at a time so for all i know there was only one but i saw this same light and behaiver 6-8 times within an hr. my girl friend thought i was making it up untill i pointed out the light the last two times it was visibal;41.7723;-87.9796000000001
Rapid moving lights.  ((NUFORC Note:  Space Shuttle w/ ISS??  PD));2007-06-19 23:14:00;5 sec;Rapid moving lights Observed 2 lights very far distance equidsitant moving at a very rapid speed in a southern direction.  At first I thought these might be planes but I observed a plane moving just below these two lights at a very slow speed compared to the lights.  I observed these lights for approximatley 10 sec. before they both vanished almost simultaneously. ((NUFORC Note:  Space Shuttle w/ ISS??  PD));41.7723;-87.9796000000001

Line of star-like lights all moving slowly across the night sky until they abruptly disappeared.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-26 21:20:00;2-4 minutes;Line of star-like lights all moving slowly across the night sky until they abruptly disappeared. I was walking my dog in a park at night with a clear sky. I saw a faint vertical streak on the horizon and thought it might have been the remnants of a comet streak. As I continued to look, it got brighter, closer, and began to rotate to orient horizontally in relation to the horizon. Once it was directly above me, I noticed it was a line of star-like lights, each about as bright as an average star. Some were spaced in twos or threes. I thought it could have been a comet streak but once it was horizontal across the sky I saw individual lights following a straight line pattern. The lights moved too fast to be satellites or planes but too slow to be meteors or comets. It seemed to be higher than the normal flight altitude of planes. There was a point in the sky that once the lights hit it, they fizzled out and disappeared. One by one they hit this point and until they were all gone. I also noticed that once the last light disappeared, the frogs around me start! ed singing again and I had been watching the event in dead silence. My sister was at a bonfire about two miles away and got a video of the line of lights. I truly have never seen something like this in my life.;41.7723;-87.9796000000001
