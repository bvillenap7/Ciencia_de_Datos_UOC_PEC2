MY PARROT FIRST NOTICED A BRIGHT OBJECT HIGH IN THE SKY. I SAW HIM STARRING UP AT THE SKY AND LOOKED UP TO SEE WHAT HAD CAUGHT HIS ATTENTION. THE OBJECT WAS THE SIZE OF A PIN HEAD AT ARMS LENGTH AND APPEARED TO BE HOLDING POSITION. I WENT INSIDE TO GET MY BINOCHULARS AND BEGAN OBSERVING THE OBJECT BOTH WITH THE UNAIDED EYE AND WITH THE GLASSES. THE OBJECT GLOWED WITH THE COLORS OF SILVER, RED AND BLUE. I OBSERVED THE OBJECT FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES ALL OF THAT TIME THE OBJECT HAD NOT MOVED. wHILE OBSEVING THE OBJECT WITH FIELD GLASSES ANOTHER OBJECT OF THE SAME SIZE AND COLOR CAME INTO MY VISION FROM THE NORTH HEADING SOUTH AND APPEARED TO MERGE WITH THE FIRST OBJECT. THE OBJECT THEN MOVED EAST AT THE SPEED OF A FIGHTER JET AND I LOST SITE OF IT. TWO MINUTES LATER I FOUND THE OBJECT AGAIN. IT HAD MOVED EAST AND A LITTLE NORTH FROM THE PREVIOUS LOCATION. I OBSERVED THE OBJECT FOR ANOTHER 5 MINUTES WHILE IT MOVED DUE SOUTH AT A SLOW SPEED UNTIL I NO LONGER COULD SEE THE OBJECT. THE OBJECT WAS ALWAYS VARY HIGH IN THE SKY AND MADE NO SOUND. THE COLORS OF THE OBJECT REMAINED THE SAME DURING MY OBSERVATION.;41.7723;-87.9796000000001
