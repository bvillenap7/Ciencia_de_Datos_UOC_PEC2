It was approximately 8:30 when I saw two flashing red lights in the northwest sky.   I saw the two flashing red light for about 2 min.  The lights were pulsating and moving at the same time.  They moved upward in the sky then came down on an a left angle and dissapeared.   I tried to show my mom but she couldn't see it with the reflection of the street light on her front window.
