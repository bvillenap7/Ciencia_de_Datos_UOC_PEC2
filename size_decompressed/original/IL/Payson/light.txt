Clear conditions, sun at the horizon, no haze, light N breeze. Just a few degrees South of the sun, which was sitting on the horizon and at about 30 degrees angle above the horizon, (about where the star Diadem would be - I checked that location on my star chart on my phone) we saw a dim star appear.  It remained stationary throughout the entire sighting that lasted about 5 minutes (or so it seemed).  It slowly got brighter until it gleamed like the sun reflecting on a jetliner fuselage, brighter than any star.  And there were no other stars in the sky.  The moon was behind a cloud bank behind us and to the south.  The light dimmed slowly back to very faint, then it ramped up again to the metallic bright gleam for a few moments, and then faded slowly until it was barely visible.  I looked at the Star Chart to confirm the name of the star in that location as a way describe the light, and when I looked for the light again,it was nowhere to be seen and did not reappear.;39.8156;-91.2619
