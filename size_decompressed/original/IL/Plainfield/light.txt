Altitude maybe 10 to 20,000 feet, and would be important to stress the intensity of the purple flash,it left my eyes with the same efect one would have from looking at a camera flash. Also an important aspect was that a high power spotlight was used by light signalling before this event occurred.;41.5903171052632;-88.2129875000002
Single light moves through sky at alarming rate In Plaifield, Illinois;2006-05-20 02:35:00;3 seconds;Single light moves through sky at alarming rate In Plaifield, Illinois I was laying on a slab of cement in the middle of plainfield looking at the stars when I saw a light move across the sky. The object looked somewhat like a plane, in which it had a center light with a glow around it, but it was moving extremely too fast to be any aircraft to my knowledge. I had seen a lot of meteors that night also but I have seen quite a few meteors and even fireballs in the past and this looked nothing like those. It was only for a a few seconds that I saw it cause it moved throught the sky in a straight line so quickly.;41.5903171052632;-88.2129875000002
Lights in the sky straight up, maneuvered, then straight down.;2014-10-18 21:00:00;15 minutes;Lights in the sky straight up, maneuvered, then straight down. Stepped outside in the evening and saw in the distance red and white alternating light ascend straight up from behind trees. The lights must have either been small or far away as they would blank out every time line-of-sight had it behind one of the power lines. We were unable to capture using cell phone cameras as the lights would not show up on the otherwise black screen. Lights appeared to be quite high in altitude, and made several back and forth flight patterns unlike what a plane would be capable of. (Helicopter, perhaps, but there was no noise)  At one point the lights changed to blue, and ultimately descended straight down behind the trees in the distance to a similar location from where it arose.  I thought perhaps it could have been a neighbor's remote-control helicopter or UFO, but was surprised at the extremely high altitude it appeared to be able to reach.;41.5903171052632;-88.2129875000002
Spot light;2016-04-25 22:30:00;45 seconds;I was teaching my daughter how to distinguish between stars and planets, and as we were looking at Jupiter, we noticed to the left of it a faint spot light that traveled downwards from our point of sighting.  The light was clear, and traveling at very high speed, until it disappeared on the lower horizon southwest-south .;41.5903171052632;-88.2129875000002
Red/White Light seen over field off of Praire Grove Dr. and Wingstem St. next to nearby Middle School.;2018-06-25 02:37:00;2 minutes;Red/White Light seen over field off of Praire Grove Dr. and Wingstem St. next to nearby Middle School On June 25, 2018, at 2:36 AM., I received a FaceTime call from two of my friends.  They immediately exclaimed that one of them had seen a UFO and that “they’re are aliens out here”.  I told them to record it for me and to promise me that they were not lying or fabricating any details, my friend who is the one who witnessed it named, ((male name deleted)), claimed he was not lying and seemed anxious but ultimately agreed to record it.  Two minutes later at 2:38 AM, I received a Snapchat video of a bright red light with a white light in the center, which stood still.  ((male name deleted)) recorded the footage in a secluded Walmart parking lot behind the store which was right next to the field where he claims the UFO was hovering.  He claims that it would disappear and then reappear in the same spot but only did so once.  The video shows ((male name deleted)) out of breath, saying “ - I’m alright” to the other person present who did not witness anything, before continuing to hyperventilate.  The caption on the! Snapchat video said, “It moved after this bruh”.  Although the 8 second video is short, it does show the unexplained light.  Now I live near where the location that they are talking about and there are no cell towers in the area where the UFO was sighted, and that would give off such a light.  He claims it was definitely not any commercial aircraft like an airplane or helicopter.  The video depicts a bright red light with a white light in the center. Upon sending me this video, ((male name deleted)) claimed that when he looked back up it had disappeared without a trace, as if it had disappeared within the blink of an eye.  No entities were seen despite the comment about aliens, that was just his belief as to the origins of the UFO.  I screen recorded the video so that footage is in my possession.  I told him I would go to the spot in case there was any trace evidence, but was unable to do so due to work.  We haven’t received any storms, only intense heat from a recent heatwave that had struck the Midwest, but besides that there is no indication that any trace eviden ce would disappear as a result.  I will update on any future findings, such as increased electromagnetic activity in the sighting location, along with any types of abnormal radiation that may have affected plant life or any animals.  I am okay with my name being displayed as I encourage others to contact me about their sightings as well.  ((male name deleted)) agrees to have his name displayed also.  ((male name deleted)) was questioned about the encounter thoroughly and assisted me in the creation of this report.  Anyone wishing to contact Colin or the other individual who had accompanied ((male name deleted)), can be contacted through me personally. - ((author's name deleted));41.5903171052632;-88.2129875000002
I noticed from the corner of my eye a string of lights.   ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-26 20:40:00;About 3 minutes;I was enjoying a nice fire &#128293 in my back yard when I noticed from the corner of my eye a string of lights. At first I thought I was seeing things then I’d call my kids to verify what I was seeing. It was a trail of lights about 20 of them in a single formation moving from the horizon to the point of the night sky. I’d compared it to a machine gun shooting white tracer rounds to the sky. Craziest thing I’d ever saw;41.5903171052632;-88.2129875000002
