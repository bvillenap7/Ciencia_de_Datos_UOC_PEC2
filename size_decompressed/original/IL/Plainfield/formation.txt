5 firey red orbs in a checkmark formation;2011-08-11 21:00:00;3 minutes;5 firey red orbs in a checkmark formation About 5 firey red orbs were seen making a checkmark formation off to the west.  The lights moved around slightly, back and forth, and then held still for some time.  It is unclear if some of the lights disappeared instantly or faded out as my view was partially obstructed by some trees, but at the close of the sighting I could see only two of the lights, and both moved steadily to the north before fading a bit and disappearing.  Several minutes later it appeared that one of the lights had returned to the same spot and sat still, but as a lone light it would be hard to say for sure that it had been part of the initial formation, or even anomalous to begin with.;41.5903171052632;-88.2129875000002
