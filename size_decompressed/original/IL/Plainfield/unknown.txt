((HOAX??))  Red and green lights gliding across the sky, then lowering down.;2014-09-06 22:00:00;3 minutes;Red and green lights gliding across the sky, then lowering down. I was sitting on my door step talking on my cell phone to my friend.  Looking straight across the street and above the houses, I saw a red and green light glide slowly to the right, slowly to the left, then returned to the middle and slowly lowered down.   The craft disappeared behind the house in front of me.   I stood up and ran as fast as I could across the street and it disappeared.  There is no way that a plane or helicopter could have moved like that.   It was perfectly gliding across the sky!  I was pretty terrified.;41.5903171052632;-88.2129875000002
