Noticed bright white object slowly hovering Southward, in a partly cloudy but otherwise clear sky.   After about 5 minutes of viewing, it rotated or transformed from a horizontal line shape to a vertical one.  There was no noise or discernible lights.   I have cellphone photos of the object, but they don't do the sighting any justice.;41.5903171052632;-88.2129875000002

Quickly appears and disappears while viewing Mars My stepfather told me of a strange star outside while he was walking the dog. He pulled out his phone app star chart and exclaimed that it was Mars.  I was intrigued so I walked out my front door to take a look.  There I saw Mars and as I was looking at it, I glanced slightly to the right and above the light pole there was a very quick warping light almost resembling a boomerang that was shifting shape, all the while glowing a yellowish light which moved about 8 feet further to the right while in a zig zag motion, with no noticeable flight pattern, before suddenly disappearing.  Upon seeing this, I explained to myself “Oh my gosh, what is that!”.  Before retreating inside to immediately write this report. It wasn’t a lightning bug since it was too large and too fast.  Definitely wasn’t a shooting star, too large and i could see the light in front of a neighbor’s house.  It almost resembled the form of a bat, but that’s not likely unless bats warp shape, glow, and ! disappear out of nowhere. It was a very strange light, and it didn’t have a physical form.  My stepdad said that my dog was acting weird on the walk.  That after they cross our block, they both heard something and my dog was very eager to get out of there and back home.  Whether it’s related to the light I saw minutes later, I cannot verify, but I believe it was.;41.5903171052632;-88.2129875000002
