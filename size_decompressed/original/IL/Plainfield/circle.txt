I couldnt decide if i was seeing a plane and it just appeared to be flying funny or what. but as it somewhat appeared to come lower in the sky it was sort of teetering and the sun was reflecting off of it. so i watched it.. id see it shine, then fade.. over and over till all of a sudden it was gone..like i said i had a perfectly clear view.. so nothing went left right up or down.. i just was staring and waiting for that reflection to come back on the tilt and it was gone.. i kept looking all around .. vanished. dont know what it was ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

There were 2 objects hovering below the clouds, they appeared to be on fire. Both object moved in different directions into the clouds.;2013-02-06 09:50:00;5 minutes;There were 2 objects hovering below the clouds, they appeared to be on fire. Both object moved in different directions into the clouds. My wife and I were traveling north on Rt 59 near Illinois 126. I noticed what appeared to be 2 aircraft hovering below the clouds.  The objects were glowing as if they were on fire.   The objects seemed to be a few hundred feet apart, then they moved in closer.   One of the objects start to move to the west and went up into the clouds.  The other object started moving north at an accelerated speed entering the clouds about 10 miles away.  I scanned the horizon hopping to get another glimpse, I never thought to film the incident.;41.5903171052632;-88.2129875000002
Two balls of fire hovering in the sky over Plainfield, Illinois.;2013-02-06 21:50:00;5 minutes;Two balls of fire hovering in the sky over Plainfield Illinois I was riding in the car with my husband going north on route 59 near route 126.  My husband noticed two objects in the sky and pointed them out to me.  He said, What are those things.  We pulled off the street into a parking lot and watched the objects.  It was a cloudy night and these objects were below the cloud cover.  There were no stars or planes visible to us. The objects appeared to be hovering and initially were not real close together.  A few seconds later they got very close to each other.  They were round objects that were glowing bright  and looked like they were on fire.  They parted, one going west into the clouds and the other going north very quickly then into the clouds.  There did not appear to be any sound.  We were so stunned we did not think of recording the event on our phones.;41.5903171052632;-88.2129875000002

Changing red and lime green orb seen in the western sky of Plainfield, IL.;2015-11-02 18:30:00;10 minutes;Changing red and lime green orb seen in the western sky of Plainfield, IL. In the western sky, just after sunset, a bright lime green circular orb jettisoned into the sky at a rapid speed.  It then sped in a horizontal direction across the sky, sometimes changing colors to a bright red.  At other times, it would hover in one spot.  Eventually it completely disappeared. About 3 minutes later, it approached the same area in the sky, but this time it came speeding from the south.  It was flying both in a horizontal and vertical pattern at rapid speeds, all the time changing from bright red to lime green.  Although this seems like it could be the red and green lights of any plane, the formation it moved and the color it changed were unlike a plane.  Again, it would just hover at certain times and eventually it disappeared. While continuing to watch, a bright white light came out of the south.  This appeared to be plane, as we have planes flying to Midway or O'Hare nightly.  However this plane came speeding to the same area of the sky, circled the exact location of the changing orb and then sped off to the north.;41.5903171052632;-88.2129875000002
Bright White/Grey light moves across Plainfield, Illinois.;2016-04-18 20:00:00;10 seconds;Bright White/Grey light moves across Plainfield, Illinois. I was in the kitchen putting my dirty dishes in the sink when I look outside the window in the kitchen and see a round, bright, white, light, as I see this craft at first thinking it to be a plane,but it moved faster and made no noise, and it suddenly moved into the clouds and it was then permanently out of sight.  It was darker in the middle and then got whiter along the outside.  I kept to myself about it, because I don't want my family to think I'm crazy but the more I think about it, the more strange it seems.;41.5903171052632;-88.2129875000002

I took 3 pictures but because it was so small it only appeared on one.  Although when I looked at the photo it appears the craft is grey, I biked home immediately and here I am!;41.5903171052632;-88.2129875000002
Three events in Plainfield, Illinois from May 30-July 30.;2020-07-29 04:00:00;5 minutes;Three events in Plainfield, Illinois from May 30-July 30. To Whom it May Concern:  I have three incidents to report in the Plainfield/Shorewood, Illinois area. The first took place on May 30, 2020 at 6:23 p.m Central Time. I know the exact date and time because someone on a local Facebook group posted a video (link below). You can see that I commented and said, “They were balloons” because right around the same time I was walking my dog and saw a cluster of silver balloons floating. The video is NOT what I saw and is clearly NOT balloons.  Second, I do not know the exact date. It was around 8:00 pm Central Time due east in the sky at a normal airplane altitude. I saw it from my bedroom window. I noticed it because it was a very bright, white, circular or cylindrical light. At first, I thought it was Venus because the object was stationary or very slowly moving. I thought that it seemed lower than Venus’s position, but did not know what other extremely bright object would be in the night sky at that time. I kept watching while I was brushing my teeth and even called my fiance to come look. I walked back into the bathroom to finish brushing my teeth and went back to the window. The object VERY quickly shot directly towards our house, due west from it’s hovering position, and was gone. I checked my flight tracking app and there was nothing in that location.  The last event took place today, July 29, 2020 at approximately 4:25 a.m. Central Time. I was walking my dog as I normally do because I wake up very early for my job. I happened to look up because it was a very clear sky and I love to see the stars and planets. At approximately 30 degrees northeast, I saw a fast moving object. It was high in the sky, higher than I’ve ever observed an airplane, white and circular. I thought that maybe it was a satellite or shooting star. I continued watching the object and it suddenly “turned off,” or disappeared. I kept watching and the object reappeared slightly more to the east in the straight path it was traveling. Suddenly, it fully stopped and reversed it’s flight path. Then, it began moving in a slow zig-zag pattern. At this point, I had to return home so I held up my phone to take a video and my phone was spazzing on and off. Not sure why. I have never seen this happen to my phone and it was fully charged as I charged it all night lon! g.  Finally, I have noticed a large increase in planes flying over my area. One after another at times. There is an airport nearby (Joliet and Chicago), so I attributed it to that. This is just anecdotal information. I know I am not really a credible or reliable source, but I do believe that all of the incidents are unidentifiable. I hope that this helps in some way.
