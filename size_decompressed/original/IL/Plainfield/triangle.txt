I looked up and saw a craft flying pretty fast and low towards the north east.  It then took a swooping turn towards what seemed like the Indiana area.  The manueverability was pretty impressive. About 30 seconds later, I saw another craft do pretty much the same thing. I'm sure it was some sort of military craft, but it was nothing that I had ever seen before.  And sound was loud as they approached over my house.  As they got further away, I couldnt hear them anymore. By the lighting on the craft, they apppeared to by triangular.  Could have been a SR-71 Blackbird or so I thought. But after checking out pics of that plane, I would highly doubt it.;41.5903171052632;-88.2129875000002

From my 2nd story bedroom window, I just happened to look outside in the night sky towards Joliet, IL which is approximately three miles southwest of my residence.  I saw one extremely bright white light shining in the sky headed northwest.  At first I thought it was a private airplane headed towards Joliet airport, but noticed it wasnâ€™t changing latitude.  As I was watching to see if this was a plane, I noticed two more bright white lights come on which made this craft look like an obtuse triangle.  During the event, the craft did not seem to change direction and all three lights looked connected. Once the three lights were shining brightly, I woke my husband up and asked him to look outside.  As he got up to look, only two of the lights remained shining.  These two lights were the closer of the three and they stayed on for about ten more seconds.  As my husband and I were watching the two white lights shining brightly in the sky, one went out and the other stayed on for about five more seconds and then disappeared.
