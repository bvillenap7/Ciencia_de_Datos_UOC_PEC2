2 low flying lights traveling east near Caton Farm Road and Red Hawk Drive, visible for 10 seconds.;2006-07-18 23:00:00;10-15 seconds;2 low flying lights traveling east near Caton Farm Road and Red Hawk Drive, visible for 10 seconds. Seem to look like 2 glowing birds, traveling east 200 yards south of Caton Farm Road, west of Drauden.  These 2 glowing birds, seem circular and moving close to each other then farther apart, but traveling together in the same path parallel.  Almost like clustered spotlights.    Ended over Joliet fire dept. near high power lines.  But never appeared again.  No sound heard.;41.5903171052632;-88.2129875000002
red orb seen in plainfield.illinois at route 126 and druden;2010-09-04 03:55:00;2 min;red orb seen in plainfield.illinois at route 126 and druden Driving east on route 126 just east of county line I observed a red orb coming at me from the the north. This object was below the cloud cover and looked like a light from a communication tower. As this object approached I began to slow down to get a better look to see if can identify it. I crossed druden and R126 and observed this object come to a complete stop, hover and than go straight up into the cloud cover.  From what I was able to observe it seem to be no larger than a school bus except that it was circular and made no discernible sound,if there was a sound I was not able to hear it over the noise of my truck.  This entire episode last no more than 2 minutes and occurred at 3:55 this morning. And as luck would have it I was the only person on the road at that time.;41.5903171052632;-88.2129875000002
Low level brightly colored reddish orange object flying over Plainfield, IL 9-3-12 at 9:05 PM;2012-09-03 21:05:00;7 minutes;Low level brightly colored reddish orange object flying over Plainfield, IL 9-3-12 at 9:05 PM At approximately 9:05 PM I was talking with my wife on our back patio,which faces east, on Labor Day night in Plainfield,IL and I spotted out of the corner of my eye a very bright reddish orange light moving on a level flight pattern towards us at out of the eastern sky. I stopped my coversation with my wife and pointed it out to her and she saw it and was amazed at the colors and its shape. I got up from my patio and walked to the northern corner of our back yard to get a clear look at this what appeared as an object moving on a level flight pattern from the east going west. In the mean time my wife went inside our house to get our son's ages 26, and 25 and our one son's girl friend age 29. In the mean time I stood at in my place in my yard continuing to observe this very bright object that had what appeared as cone shaped or spikes shaped objects projecting out of the center of a cigar shaped center of which the entire object was completely illuminating a pulsating reddish orange aura. As it came completley in front of me it appreared that the center of this object's center cigar shape had a line of white/blue/purplish glowing aura. I must stop here to explain that where we live we are in a flight line for Chicago Midway airport where on a daily basis we must see at least 30 or more commercial jets making their final approach into Midway and are approximately 5 - 6 thousand in altitude. Having seeing these daily for the 12 years we live here, I can differentiate the lights on commercial planes and how they change as they move and literaly pass over our house. This object never changed colors if anything as it moved directly pass me at 5-6 thousand feet in altitue, it clearly became more appearent this was no ordinary airchraft. As stated before, the entire object was totally illuminated and was larger than any plane I have seen in my life and as it passed I waited to hear the sound of jet engine or even possibely the sound of a propellar engine. What I hea! rd was nothing at all and at that time it was completely silent outside. As it moved westward away from me, it looked the same from the back as it did from the front, same colors, shapes, and pulsating aura. For the next few minuites as it began to disappear to the west I noticed all I could could make out of this was a bright red dot. At the time I witnessed this I would estimate that this object was traveling at the same or slightly faster speed of the airchraft that fly over our house daily on their final approach. (Maybe 200 mph).  But as it was at the point where it reached as far west of where  it turned to a red dot, it suddenly moved upward in altitude at a very fast speed and then it was no longer visable. Just at this time I noticed a commercial jet was comming out of the western sky perpandicular to this oject, and that is when the object shot upward out of sight. I am a 49 year old man whom I would decribe as someone who has has much experience with aircraft of many types, including military craft, and I have never seen anything like this before.;41.5903171052632;-88.2129875000002
