The object was a bright yellowish glowing gold color that became brighter and changed to a bright blue / white color that was bright enough to create a halo effect all around it.  The light continued north at a slow pace as I told my wife to come outside and take a look, then requested for her to get the video camera.  My 11 year old son ran inside and retrieved his i-pod as well to film it, which he did.  The object made no sound, had no blinking lights and looked like a tube shaped object at its core  as it chnaged back to a golden yellow then green/ blue bright light while still retaining the tube shape at its core.  Just as it began to brighten again, it just vanished in the sky at about 70' above u! s.  Nothing was seen in front or behind it, no trail followed it, no sound whatsoever, there was no wind that night or clouds at the time we viewed this. I am a law enforcement ofc with over 19 years of experience, with numerous years spent working nights and have never seen anything like this before.  I know how to identify the differences between a planet, a star, a meteroite as well as a satelite. This was definitely not an airplane, jet or helicopter as it made no sound. I was able to tape it for 15 seconds and my son taped it for about 25 seconds.  The total duration of the sighting was for approximately 1 minute from the time it was first viewed until it just vanished in the sky.;41.5903171052632;-88.2129875000002
