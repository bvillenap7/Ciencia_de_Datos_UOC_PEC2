Fireball over Plainfield, Illinois.;2010-07-04 21:30:00;2-3 min;Fireball over Plainfield My wife and 3 boys were out on the patio last night admiring the neighborhood fireworks displays.   I happend to be looking up at the sky when I saw this odd orange glowing fireball going across the sky.  We watched it going in a stright line heading North for a few minutes until it was just a distint flicker.  As it was gliding overhead, I yelled over ot my neighor who was also on her patio watching the same object float by.  None of us could figure out what we were seeing.;41.5903171052632;-88.2129875000002

My boyfriend, two friends visiting from out of town, and I were enjoying an evening outside on our backyard.  It was right about 11:30 pm when we saw a very large, unusually bright, orange looking fireball that seemed to suddenly rise above the two story house which sits behind us.  The weather was clear that night it truly was a beautiful evening out. It was so large and bright that it looked like it was right above us but really it was so far away. It was easily 20, 000 plus feet high in the air. The reason I am sure of this, is our guests that evening are of military and have government backgrounds, and are quit knowledgeable in these areas.  They too sat in wonder and curiosity as we watched this thing traveling above and across us.  The fireball first appeared above our neighbor’s  house to the East of us traveling West, moving toward us,  at a somewhat constant speed not to fast as it became to become directly passing above us one of the guys pointed out it appeared to have what looked like a ring around it.. They certainly couldn’t offer any explanations of what we were seeing, none of us could. Something else we noticed, there was absolutely was no sound coming from this object! It is not a far distance from the house behind us to ours, but it was just a few minutes, as it passed across us and once it did the orange fireball began to cross over the top of our house it continued moving West but at the same time seemed to almost move straight upward as well, much, much higher moving what look to disappear into the stars.  I certainly will never forget what I saw I admit every night I find myself looking over the top of our neighbor’s house at night wanting too, and wondering if I will see this again, what an extraordinary site!;41.5903171052632;-88.2129875000002
