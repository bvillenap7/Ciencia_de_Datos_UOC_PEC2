I saw a red light above my head at first I thought it was a drone, but the way it moved no drawn that I know of can move like that.  It moved back and forth up and down sharp angles and very quickly.  I went to grab my cell phone to capture it on video.  By the time I pulled my camera up, it appeared to be hiding behind a cloud.  I could see a faint red orb. then from behind the cloud I saw a bunch of flashing multi-colored lights like a strobe disco light.  I came out from behind the cloud and I was videoing it or trying to.  I followed it, it started to move away as soon as I started recording it.  I followed it for several yards I think.  The orb went straight back went straight back and then dropped straight down next to the Moon I also saw a flash of something out of the corner of my eye on the right hand side but I was busy trying to video the red orb.  I examined the video and there are cle! arly three objects in some of the frame 1 being the Moon, two other objects unknown. literally 5 minutes after this encounter I brought my bird inside the house without the front window I saw a bright white light in front of the house and I will make a separate report for that sighting that one there were several adult witnesses and a couple of children.  I have extensive footage of that for that event lasted about 30 minutes.  I have both still shots and video.;41.5903171052632;-88.2129875000002
Unbelievable fireworks in the heavens multiple orbs spotted, extensive video photos several witnesses;2020-07-04 21:34:00;30 minutes;Unbelievable fireworks in the heavens multiple orbs spotted, extensive video photos several witnesses As per my previous report, I just filmed a red UFO in my backyard. I came into the house, went upstairs to put my bird inside. I looked out the front window and saw a very very bright light outside and the sky in front of the house. I immediately went downstairs went out the front door, and began to videotape the object. I have extensive footage video. When I was observing it it was at least 20 minutes.   are times I videotaped and other times I just stared up at it.  It seemed to change colors.  It was initially White, but then it looked like it had like rays of colors coming down from it.  It moved, it was way too big to be a drone.  Much too bright in the way it maneuvered it definitely was not a done.  Actually I layed down on my driveway  drivto try to hold my camera steady.  It was right up above the street. It almost appeared to be watching the fireworks.  5 doors down my neighbors are blowing off fireworks with their kids.  after observing this orb for a period of about 20 minutes I walked over there and ask them if they could see it and I pointed at it they were amazed.  Three adult males and three adult females and one child witness this event. I believe at least one person video taped it.  it had moved from where it was when I initially saw it almost to have followed me and as soon as they put up their phones to videotape it it shot off into the distance and then dropped straight down find that houses. This event happened within just a few minutes of the previous Avant all right orb and the backyard. Will send link to photos still shots video. Thanks Denise;41.5903171052632;-88.2129875000002
