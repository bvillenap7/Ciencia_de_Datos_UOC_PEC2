The sound was a very deep almost like white noise/humming sound that also did not sound like a plane or helicopter and was most startling. I'm basing my judgment on the fact that we live near airports and also Central DuPage Hospital and see airplanes and helicopters very frequently. The object was at first seemingly still in the East and then moved right (South) and left (North). I'm sharing this bc my gut instinct was that this is different and didn't seem normal.;41.8727;-88.147
