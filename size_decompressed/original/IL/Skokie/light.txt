Unmanned Aerial Systems in night sky above Skokie, IL.;2020-02-15 20:00:00;7 minutes;Unmanned Aerial Systems in night sky above Skokie, IL. My wife and I were returning home from dinner near Dempster and Crawford in Skokie, IL on Feb. 14, 2020 â€“ Valentine Day. I first noticed two Unmanned Aerial Systems, guessing, one to two miles in the distance, hovering, stationary and close together, appearing as constant star color, west of Crawford.  After several moments, one pulled away and dropped in a straight line very rapidly in a matter of several seconds to about half the distance to the horizon. The other after a short time continued west very quickly in a straight line, and faded almost out of sight. The shape of both objects remained constant.  The UAS that dropped continued moving south and quickly merged with UAS described below. Towards the southwest we counted approximately 8 or 9 other objects.  Counting was difficult because of the quickness and the back and forth of their movements.  Three or four were definitely helicopters, long military shapes with flashing night- lights, moving west while two or three other star dot shaped lights were flying east towards the objects moving west.  All appeared to be at a variety of heights to one another, very high to very low.  All objects were moving extremely fast, in straight lines and in close proximity to one another. The action looked chaotic.;42.0348857142858;-87.7454857142858
