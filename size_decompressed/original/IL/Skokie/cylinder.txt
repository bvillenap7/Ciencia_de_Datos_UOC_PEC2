Glowing silver cylinder seen in daylight.;2008-11-28 15:40:00;5 - 10 minutes;Glowing silver cylinder seen in daylight. This occurred on 11/28/2008, 15:40.  My son and I where outside playing catch in our front yard.  We live near the O'Hare air corridor and routinely see many commercial aircraft.  As I caught a toss, I noticed bright, silver, glowing cylinder flying possibly 1000 feet in altitude.  My son and I noted that the cylinder had no wings, no tail rudder and made no noise.  I estimate that the cylinder may have been 100 plus feet in length.   There was no mistaking this object for a commercial aircraft.  The object just traveled in a straight line from North to South until it faded into a dot and disappeared into the horizon.  The sky was cloudless and it was very light out.;42.0348857142858;-87.7454857142858
