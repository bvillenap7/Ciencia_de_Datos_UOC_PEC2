Looked like a Blue Star, that flew SE from its NorthWest location and faded out of sight.;2014-08-02 22:00:00;<1 minute;Looked like a Blue Star, that flew SE from its NorthWest location and faded out of sight. I went to the living room to close the blinds and noticed a single star.  I thought it was a bit bright considering there were no other stars in the sky due to the thick cloud/chemtrail cover. I watched the star for a few seconds and it began to slowly move South-Eastish from its location.  As it was moving, another dimly lit 'star' appeared and remained stationary.  The first star kept moving in a SE direction and the second star faded in and out. After about 30 seconds of movement from the first star, it simply disappeared, no flashing lights or anything.  It was simply a star moving, and then gone. The second star completely dimmed out after the first one faded away. I hope this helps, it was a strange sight and I see quite a few of them up here at night, usually from 1am to 4 am. I'll update you again with the next one.;42.0348857142858;-87.7454857142858
