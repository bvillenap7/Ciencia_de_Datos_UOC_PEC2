Phone pulled out and recorded the rest this is my 3rd recorded sighting in 6 months same location.  Much activity this years in the area.   But was never able to record what I did here. Please understand that what you are seeing as exactly what the stars looked like in the clear black night.. they formed a perfect triangle at the end.  Stayed like that for 30 min and gone;42.0348857142858;-87.7454857142858
