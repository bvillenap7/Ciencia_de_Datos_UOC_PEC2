White orb changing direction filmed INSIDE my house;2017-02-18 20:15:00;2 seconds;White orb changing direction filmed INSIDE my house With my iPhone 6 I recorded a white light the size of a tennis ball going across the screen while filming in slo mo which is a rate of 60 fames per second.  It's inside with the shades which are light proof closed.  the windows face a very wooded area.  The is only  2 light in the room and they are stationary the camera is stationary.  Is there some problem with the iPhone 6 that makes it look like a white orb is going across the screen.  It seems very unlikely a white orb would be inside my house so I would love a reasonable explanation  So i can rest assured there is not some thing floating though my house.  So please tell me its just some problem with my iPhone.  I will post this on vimeo tomorrow and send you the link;42.0348857142858;-87.7454857142858
