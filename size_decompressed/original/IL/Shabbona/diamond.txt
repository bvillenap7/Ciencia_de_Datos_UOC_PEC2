Diamond shape craft appearing to be taking on water above small lake at campground;2011-07-16 02:00:00;10 min;Diamond shape craft appearing to be taking on water above small lake at campground we were camping at a state park. I  went out for a smoke. our site was on a hill overlooking the lake. no boats or anybody are allowed on lake after dark.  i noticed what i thought was a chinesse lantern about 400ft away from where i was.  i swear it was a lantern cause i could clearly see fire flickering inside.  it was about ten feet above the water just sitting there.lanterns float up but this just sat there,  then it slowly started rising to about 50 ft. as it did it seemed to start getting dimmer.  at mabey 100ft it started changing shape and i could see a white strobe on left and green on right.  it slowly turned and i could clearly see a black diamond shape.  it slowly floated with NOT A SOUND over my site, not more than 100 ft away.and disapeared over the campground out of site.  five min later off in the distance i seen a light hovering over trees heading the same direction.  i was on the phone with 911 which was stupid cause the responding officer thought i was just another moron.  i know what i saw and no one can ever change my mind.   my daughters boyfreinds grandpa is a ((deleted--public employee)) and had seen the same type of craft while on duty a yr prior to me.  i beleive the craft was taking in water as thats what came to my mind when i seen this event.  i took photos and you can clearly see an object but photo didnt turn out.. just the negitive.;41.7603;-88.8748
