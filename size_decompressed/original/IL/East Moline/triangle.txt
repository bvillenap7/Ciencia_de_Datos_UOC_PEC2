triangular shape caught my attention.;2007-12-24 03:15:00;10 minutes;triangular shape caught my attention. 3:15 am December 24, I woke and went to the bathroom.  When I looked out the window I saw a triangular shaped formation in the distant sky. I went to my office and grabbed my camera and returned very quickly. I have a Fujifilm S8000fd with a 18X optical zoom lens.  I cropped the pictures to reduce file size but I have saved the originals.  I lightened the first one to try and make out any unseen image. I extended the lens to max and rested it against the window frame and took eight pictures. I thought that it was the same object but it looked so different that I would lower the camera to do a visual and it was the only light spot in the sky. Since you guys deal with this all the time I felt I should send them along to you.;41.5114;-90.434
