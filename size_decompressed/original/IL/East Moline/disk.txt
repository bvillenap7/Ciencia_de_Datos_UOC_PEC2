2 glowing amber disks fly slowly overhead in different directions.;2011-03-15 00:00:00;3 - 5 minutes;2 glowing amber disks fly slowly overhead in different directions. I should have reported this when it happened.  I suppose some incredulity upon my part prevented me from doing so but as time has passed I can't seem to forget about it and upon looking up the NUFORC web site and seeing your request for reports of such sightings I have decided to make a report even though it is after the fact.  As quite a bit of time has elapsed I can't remember exactly when it occurred. I do know that it was 2011 the end of Winter, early Spring. I can also not recall the time, although am fairly certain that it was between 10:00 PM and 2:00 AM.  I had gone outside to make a trip to the nearby 7-11 and had noticed how remarkably crisp and clear the night was with the stars very visable. I decided upon returning to go and sit outside for awhile and stargaze.   I got out a lawn chair and before I could even sit down noticed an object directly above me. It was a disk-like glowing amber light flying from directly overhead to my 11 o'clock disappearing over the roof of my house to the north.  I then noticed another object just like the first to my 3 o'clock flying south/ southeast which disappeared from sight behind the tree line.  Both objects emitted a steady muted amber glow and flew at a constant velocity similar to the speed of a commercial airliner. The height of the objects was indeterminate.  There were no flashing lights.  Each object was roughly 1/8 the size of the full moon.;41.5114;-90.434
