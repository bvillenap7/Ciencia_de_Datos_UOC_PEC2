What began as a star looking object which was stationary began moving from north to southeast.  It caught my attention because it appeared to just begin to move from out of the starfield rather than coming from the horizon.   It flew directly overhead and faded and became invisible.  I was out star gazing and UFO hunting, which I have been doing frequently since witnessing two amber disks last winter.  This was not an iridium flare, which I have also witnessed before on one occasion.;41.5114;-90.434
