Bright Pulsing light high in the sky Over I-80 around Mile 26 in Illinois;2012-04-20 21:55:00;3-5 mins;Bright Pulsing light high in the sky Over I-80 around Mile 26 in Illinois At 2144 we were heading Westbound on Interstate 80 approximately mile 32 when we noticed a “shooting star” which was low to the ground and appeared to be on an East to West trajectory lower and parallel to the earth which lasted about 1-2 seconds.  It was in alone and appeared to be a meteor.  As we continued on our way about 5 minutes later we noticed high in the sky a light which was extremely bright to the North of us and was pulsing in intensity and stationary. Venus was clearly visible to the W/NW of us.  There were several antenna towers visible to us which were MUCH lower in altitude.  This “Pulsing  light” was kind of like a heartbeat.  It never went dark but would get brighter and then dimmer in about 2 second intervals.  It seemed to remain stationary for as long as we could see it as we travelled West in was further and further behind us until we were out of view.  We saw several lower flying commercial planes with visible flashing lights of white and red at a lower altitude. We discussed what it was. I mentioned maybe the Space station but I have seen this before at it always seemed to move across the sky, did not flash and was much dimmer. Hope this helps and other have seen this or it was the space station;41.4148;-90.0185
