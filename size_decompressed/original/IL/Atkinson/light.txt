Iridescent U.F.O. spotted by four eye witnesses over Northwest Illinois Sunday night at around 7:50 p.m.;2004-08-22 19:50:00;5 minutes;Iridescent U.F.O. spotted by four eye witnesses over Northwest Illinois Sunday night at around 7:50 p.m. It appeared as a dim light at around 7:50 p.m. Sunday night. My brother was the first to spot it. At first glance, it was hard to even see it, but over a period of about 5 to 10 minutes, it grew more intense. I yelled for my parents to come outside with the binoculars, and we each took turns looking at the apparent U.F.O. over the next several minutes. As I said, at first it was a dim light, but as it grew more intense, you could see through the binoculars that it had 3 lights in a triangular fashion that would appear, disappear, and reappear almost as if it was rotating in a fixed position in the sky. It continued to do this until the craft departed, leaving a vapor trail, at an angle going upward and westward. Right before it disappeared for good, my brother was the one who had the binoculars at the time, and he claimed that the craft, or whatever it was seemed to morph and appeared as an iridescent disc, shining red, blue, green, and yellow, before zipping off. I am not sure if it was a coincidence, but at the moment that the craft disappeared, a jet flying at a lower altitude than the craft was flying across the sky in the same vicinity as the U.F.O.
