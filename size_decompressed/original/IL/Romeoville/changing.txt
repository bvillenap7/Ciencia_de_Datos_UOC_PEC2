It was very loud and sounded like it was very close to my house.  At first I assumed there must have been an accident or something going on at the Bolingbrook Hospital nearby but then saw a very bright vertical light beyond the trees that looked like it had possibly 6 points or at least the light was illuminating in that way.  It was a yellowish-orange color and way bigger and brighter than any stars.  I woke up my boyfriend who was next to me who thought it was strange as well.  At first I thought it was maybe a really bright searchlight but then the light started to move upward in the sky like a rocket would.  I would say it did this for about 10 seconds or so.  Then the light suddenly went out and I could make out a triangular looking aircraft with red and white blinking lights that started to head in the direction of my house.  It moved faster than a plane and I just felt that it was not something normal. I looked up news stories to see if anything could explain what I saw but found nothing.  The whole experience has left me a little shaken as I have never seen anything like it in my life. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous provides no contact information.
