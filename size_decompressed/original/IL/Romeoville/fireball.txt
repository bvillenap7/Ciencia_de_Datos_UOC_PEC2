Orange/Yellow/Red Sphere or Orb seen in Romeoville IL in night sky followed by low flying helicopters  TWO seperate sightings.;2013-08-14 21:20:00;30 minutes;Orange/Yellow/Red Sphere or Orb seen in Romeoville, IL in night sky followed by low flying helicopters  TWO Seperate sightings on differ I went outside on my front porch for a cigarette.  To the South of me a flashing or pulsating light caught my attention.  I saw an orb/fireball which seemed to pulsate changing between orange red and yellow or gold.  This object seemed to hover for a few seconds. I ran into my home to grab my cell phone and call my two teenage children out to see this object.  This orb was traveling North slightly Northwest while rising up in elevation.  This object did not make any sound. However within minutes of seeing this we could hear helicopters and airplanes in the air. Many of the helicopters were flying at a low elevation. The same object seen on August 29th @ 20:34 outside of my home. Object was directly West flying/moving Northwest.again no sound.  The object was moving slower than the sighting on 08/14/13.  Again helicopters and airplanes were heard then seen flying around my home.  The helicopters did not fly as low this day as they did during my first sighting. I work at a suburban hospital. I am the director for one of the non clinical areas.  I have two teenage children 15 & 16 that were witnesses to both events.  I have a 6 year old nephew that witnessed the first event. I have some video taken with my iPhone.;41.64;-88.0717000000002
Bright red light in sky, moving erratically.;2015-09-03 21:45:00;20 seconds;Bright red light in sky, moving erratically. Went out for a smoke and saw bright reddish orange light in sky heading south, then it turned west without slowing down.  Moved very erratically.  No sound at all.  Disappeared behind the trees.   Saw similar some time back in the north east sky, again traveling erratically, bright red light went off for short time then reappeared, for a short time.  Could these be drones??;41.64;-88.0717000000002
