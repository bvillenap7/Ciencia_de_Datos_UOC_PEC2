The objects where close in proximity at first but later drifting away from each other at rapid speed. I rushed downstairs to take some video for a few minutes, and zoomed in on the objects and saw a complete circular shape that seem to pulse from small to large. The objects separated from each other and both were not seen after disappearing through the tree's. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous.  PD));41.64;-88.0717000000002
