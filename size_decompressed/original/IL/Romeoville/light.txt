Suddenly one disappeared, other traveled for 30 sec saw bright purple light then it vanish My son and I were driving and I saw two bright orange lights in sky, then I told my son to stop and look to confirm what I was seeing.  The lights were traveling far apart but in a even straight line hard to explain.  After like 30 seconds one light started fading away and disappear suddenly and the other light was closer to our view it kept on going slowly for like another 30 seconds then the orange light suddenly became a bright purple light and disappear.  It's crazy what we witness my son was afraid and confused so was Iâ€¦ I wish I took a video or pictures but the moment was so shocking and confusing.

Bright lights in the southwest sky in Illinois.;2015-01-10 03:00:00;20 minutes;Bright lights in the southwest sky in Illinois On January 10, 2015, at 3:00 am, in the southwest sky in the direction of Shorewood from Romeoville, there were two flashing lights.  It almost looked as if they were rotating and the light got dimmer as it went to the back.  One was slightly bigger than the other.  It was a brighter white with red blinking underneath it.  The other one was a bit smaller and was mostly a red flashing light.  Both hovered together for about 10 minutes.   It looked like they were flashing lights at each other.  I am 100% sure they were not planes.  Neither one ever came closer or seemed to fly in any direction.   After about 15 minutes of my observation, the brighter one, on the left, slowly started to distance itself from the one on the right.  It never got smaller (suggesting that it was not flying away), it just got further and further away.   Then, it kind of went straight up and again drifted off in a southern direction.   I took several pictures with my phone.  The quality is not very good.   After about 20 minutes, they were gone.;41.64;-88.0717000000002
