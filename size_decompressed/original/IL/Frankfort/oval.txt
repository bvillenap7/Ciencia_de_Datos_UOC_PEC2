UFO seen over Harlem Ave.;2007-12-20 18:30:00;10 minutes;UFO seen over Harlem Ave. I was driving to the local Walgreens when My sister and me noticed 2 bright red lights past harlem ave. in mattesson, I've seen these before, and in V formation, and they have been reported in local newspapers. So on the way back i start to drive towards one which has moved right over the harlem rt. 30 intersection, then it jets around at a velocity uncommon to man made aircraft.  After that it remained stationary for about 2 seconds then just disappeared, the other bright light remained back over matteson I'm not sure for how long though.;41.5094;-87.8248
