We went outside, the sky was so clear, and to the west was a white streak of light, similiar to a contrail, but not dissipating as they do.  It was visible for about 15 minutes and just disappeared gradually. I saw that Bolingbrook also lost their power which is about 35 miles from me.  I never found out what caused the power outage. but it was light outside and power was back on by 8 or 8:30. There was nothing about the outage in the local papers either. I now find that odd since reading that Bolingbrook also lost power.;41.5094;-87.8248
3 red lights in formation traveling southeast slowly and faded out one by one.;2004-10-31 19:50:00;25 minutes;3 red lights in formation traveling southeast slowly and faded out one by one. My husband, and three children observed three red lights in formation, moving slowly.  We first observed them in the northeastern sky and we watched them slowly move east of us.  They stayed in the same formation, equal distance apart, and at the same speed.  They traveled in our sky for about 25 minutes before they slowly faded out one by one.  We called friends and family and all were able to see the lights from Orland Park, and Frankfort.;41.5094;-87.8248
An orange glowing orb floated silently over our home.;2011-06-10 21:05:00;5 minutes;An orange glowing orb floated silently over our home.  It was moving slowly from NE to SW.   Could've been a Chinese Lantern.   Myself 37, and two sons ages 5 and 7 witnessed it.  I took a brief video from my iPhone, but didn't start recording until it was a good distance away.;41.5094;-87.8248
