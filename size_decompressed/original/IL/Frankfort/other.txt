Object was 50 ft. across, and 150 ft. off the ground.  It had red, green, and blue lights around the sides.  The craft itself was a dark silhouette, and there was no noise coming from it.  My nephew was with me, and he saw the same thing.  The craft was not moving. I am a 37 year-old white male, who does not drink, smoke or use drugs of any type.  I am well respected in my community.;41.5094;-87.8248
