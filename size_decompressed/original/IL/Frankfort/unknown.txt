5 red lights in a row vertically drifting slowly eastward.;2004-08-21 22:30:00;20-30 minutes;5 red lights in a row vertically drifting slowly eastward. At approximatley 10:30 pm I was looking North into the sky and saw 5 red lights all stacked in a straight line vertically. I went in to get my wife and when she came out there were only 4 lights left in the same formation. I then proceeded to watch them and they seemed to be slowly drifting to the East, but still holding the same straght line. after a few minutes another one of the lights went out, leaving three, a few minutes later another went out until there was only one lit. Again a few minutes later the last one went out.;41.5094;-87.8248
