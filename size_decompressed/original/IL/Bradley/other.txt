Was driving west in car. Glanced out window. Saw what at first I thought was a flight of geese in a long skine. Then realized it was not birds, but something that looked lik a long banner with vertical bars. The banner like object appeared to be slowly undualting and drifting to the west—there is an easterly surface wind. Didn't have much time to obsereve since the traffic was heavy. Next time I had a chance to see it, it was to the wset and somewhat smaller as if parts of it had dropped off or disspeared in some way. Did not notice anything falling.  I don't know if  the strong odor noticed shortly afterward had any connection with the object, but it was very strong and smelled something like fertilizer you might spray from a garden hose attachment. After I got home—about a mile from where i first saw the object—i could stiil smell the odor.;41.1406;-87.8634
