Bright flashing UFO spotted over northeastern kankakee county on 03/31/09;2009-03-29 19:45:00;2 hours;Bright flashing UFO spotted over northeastern kankakee county on 03/31/09 Before 7:30 p.m., I saw a bright flash of light above Northfield Square Mall.  My co-worker was looking up at the object, and he said that it looked like a bright star (mind you it was still before sunset).  The star burst with a bright flash of light and disappeared.  About 45 minutes later, it was seen again, except this time it was about 10 miles north-east of my location. I had called someone, and they decided to follow the light.  The object lingered near manteno.  It kept flashing bright orange, fading to red, and disappearing altogether.  Soon, two small airplanes began to persue the object, which quickly took off in a NE direction.  it faded into NE indiana by 9:15 p.m.;41.1406;-87.8634
