Star-like object that pulsed brightly and dimmed multiple times then became stationary;2013-08-31 05:20:00;30 minutes;star like object that pulsed brightly and dimmed multiple times then became stationary I am a police officer, i was doing overnight security for an outdoor event, basically just making sure no one came to steal any cooking items.  I was with a friend who is not a police officer. I was laying down on a picnic table and observed an object moving across the sky.  I remarked to my friend saying  hey look a sattelite he then saw it too.  It looked like a star or sattelite slowly moving.  It then began to pulse brightly and then dim.  We observed it pulse brightly 3 times, i did not count the time between pulses but it seemed to be the same time apart between each pulse, approximately 5-6 seconds. The object then stopped and was stationary for approximately 20 minutes.  After 20 minutes it was around 5:45, people were showing up to run an early morning 5k as part of the event and i was unable to continue sustained observance of the object.  I used some stars as a reference point so that i could look up and find the object again.  I looked up as i could and continued to see the object for a time and then another time i looked up and it was gone and i never saw it again.;38.6015;-90.0077000000001
