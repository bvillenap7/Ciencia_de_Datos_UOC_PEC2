I kid you not, I watched as t Husband rushed into the house and made me go outside where six stars were playing in the sky.  I kid you not, I watched as they moved all over the place and a plane past under them.  It was surreal.  Thrn 2 planes showed up circling the area at a lower altitude and the 6 stars keep going higher then back down playing with each other.  We live in an area where law enforcement has caught these types of events on video.  In fact I believe you can find one of them on you tube.  We couldn't video this cause it was too high up.  The 2 planes that showed up circled the area until all the stars were no longer visible.;38.6015;-90.0077000000001
