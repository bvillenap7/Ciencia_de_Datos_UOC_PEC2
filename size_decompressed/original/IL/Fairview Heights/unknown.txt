Red, blue, and green lights on a stair-step shaped hovering object in Fairview Heights, IL.;2006-02-09 23:45:00;8-10 seconds;Red, blue, and green lights on a stair-step shaped hovering object in Fairview Heights, IL. 11:45 PM, clear night On the way home from work I noticed colored lights to my right. I slowed my car but didn't stop. Above a treeless yard was a hovering object, silvery or grayish, with an art deco sort of smooth, stair-step shape. I did not count the number of different levels in the shape, but it was longer than it was tall. From right to left lights were flashing, first red, then blue, then green, then the red at the far right again, etc. Each flash was not particularly fast. I have no idea how high the object was hovering. I am bad with distance measurements. I was doubting my eyes and thought this might actually have been a small (12x24) object suspended not too high in the yard, but I have looked in the area twice since the sighting and have seen nothing. I believe I saw something quite large that was hovering very high in the sky.;38.6015;-90.0077000000001
