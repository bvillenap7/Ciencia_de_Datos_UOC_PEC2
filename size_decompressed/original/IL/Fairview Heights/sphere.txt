Sphere just under clouds after a tornado.;2006-04-05 18:00:00;5 seconds;Sphere just under clouds after a tornado. I was with my father making a delivery. We arrived in Fairview heights just after a tornado had blown through. I was watching the clouds still looking for signs of another tornado. The clouds were very low but seemed to be moving rather fast. We were pulling into the parking lot of ((deleted)) Fountains Pkwy Fairview Heights, IL 62208 when I rolled my window down to get a better look at the sky. I saw a Ball shaped object just below the clouds right above me a little to the right. I noticed it right away because the clouds were moving and it was not and the clouds were very low so it seemed very close to me. I would say that it was a little bigger around then a stop sign. It was a dull silver color almost like a grey. It was very slick with no type of lines or anything. it was Very smooth and round. I looked at it for a few seconds then it shot straight up into the clouds extremely fast.;38.6015;-90.0077000000001
