My 6 year old daughter and I were waiting for a train at a railroad crossing and there was an older gentleman in the truck in front of us.  I was looking at the evening sky and when I looked through the top of my windshield, I noticed 3 lights in the sky.  At first, I thought maybe it was a helicopter because the lights were hovering.  The longer I watched the more uneasy I became. I got out of my van and went to the truck in front of me to ask if anyone was seeing what I was.  The man I spoke with said that yes, I'm seeing it too before I could even get the question out of my mouth.  We watched it even after the train had passed because I wanted to listen for any sounds, but there weren't any.  It appeared to be dark in color and sort of diamond-shaped, only it had six sides. I would say it was approximately 75 yards in length.  There were 3 lights that went across one end in the form of a triangle.  The gentleman in the truck took off after nervous conversation so I left too because I didn't want to be alone.  I headed for Wal-Mart like a bat-out-of-hell and I didn't look up any more.  There were 8 people standing in the parking lot looking in the direction that I came from and when I pulled up I asked them what they were looking at and they described it to me just as I had seen it!  They said that it took off and went straight up into the air and then it was gone. It was a very long night for me, indeed.  I told a few friends and my husband (a skeptic) and I don't want to experience it ever again.  I did not have a good feeling about the experience at all.
