Large falling green ball of light;2008-10-08 20:00:00;2-3 seconds;Large falling green ball of light While driving on my way home, my wife and I both saw a large, green, v-shaped light directly ahead of us (which would be west).  It seemed to be very close and very bright.  It looked like a single firework but it was falling down.  It also was close to an Air Force Base.  We are very curious as to what we saw.  It didn't appear to be a craft.  It looked more like a falling star, but much more colorful, closer and more bright.  I believe I saw a tail on the object but my wife doesn't remember seeing one.  Please help!;38.5171;-90.204
