Large dark cigar sighted over Dupo Illinois;2006-05-29 19:00:00;2 min;Large dark cigar sighted over Dupo Illinois While standing on a bluff on the Missouri side over looking the the mississippi river valley into Dupo Illinois I spotted a large cigar shaped object dark in color. It appeared to be very large,low in the sky and hovering.  The sky was mostly clear with a few clouds. There was no sound or other aircraft in the sky at the time. There was no metalic reflection from the object. The object did not appear to be moving (left or right) from my angle although it rapidly got smaller and smaller before it dissapeared.As the object was getting smaller a couple walked up from behind me and and asked what is was. So I know it had a very unusual appearance. I am just curious if anyone else reported any sightings in that area on the same day.;38.5171;-90.204
