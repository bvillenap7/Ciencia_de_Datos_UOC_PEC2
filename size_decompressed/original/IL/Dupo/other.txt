I took my dogs out @ 5:15 am 2/05/2015.  I saw a huge bright light in the sky, just hovering in the direction of Columbia, Illinois.  After about 3 or 4 minutes it came towards me. As I looked up at it when it flew over me going west it was shaped like the Columbia space shuttle the bottom was all white lights and there were green and blue lights on the back end of the craft. I could hear the roar of the engine, as it was loud like the space shuttles would be.  It was flying low enough that I could make out the shape and see all the lights on the bottom of the craft. I wish I had taken my camera outside I will tomorrow.;38.5171;-90.204
