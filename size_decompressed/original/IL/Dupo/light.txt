We were directly in the path of the beam and looked up into it as it illuminated us. During 4th of July family fireworks, a large, low-flying object (could have been an airplane) with bright red lights on it, beamed a large, very bright blue light down on the ground directly under the object.  Our family was directly in the path and as we were all illuminated blue, we looked up into the light.  It moved off towards the woods north of the house and the light was turned off.  Two of us saw it go off just before it would have gotten to the woods.  We all discussed this strange happening at length.  The object came from the direction of Columbia, IL and moved off north towards Cahokia, IL.  Our sighting was two miles east of Dupo, IL on Imbs Station Road, about 3/4 mile west of the intersection of Imbs Station Road and Triple Lakes Road.  Observers were:  my retired parents, two sisters-in-law (one is the wife of a US Air Force Colonel--the Colonel was lighting fireworks and did not see the light), my sister, myself, and several nieces and nephews.;38.5171;-90.204
