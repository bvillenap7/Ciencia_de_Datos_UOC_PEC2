Red-green light viewed over central Illinois.;2008-04-27 01:20:00;5-10 seconds;Red-green light viewed over central Illinois. There was a single object. The object seen was almost orb-like in shape.  It was pulsating red and green and falling at a rapid pace before it disappeared close to the horizon. The sky was clear otherwise with only stars in view.  The object stood out considerably, and was much larger.  The pulsating color was completely different than any aircraft I've seen in the area.  The other strange thing was the blurred almost tail-like effect that was caused while it fell.  I was the only observer, that I know of, of the object.  I've been a believer in paranormal and UFO phenomenon for quite sometime.  This even struck me by suprise, since I have never experience such an even before.;40.6465;-89.5978
