The craft was several miles above the house. It almost looked like a spot light except it moved fast out of range for a spotlight as it kept moving west. It was an oval shape with a blue light in the center.  the outside of the oval had a frosty appearance and almost looked like a light flying under a light cloud cover but there were no clouds in the sky.  After passing over our house the craft flew at warp speed into the horizon and was gone.  I have never seen anything move so fast. Everyone that sawit described exactly the same thing.  There was no red beacon light that is required on all aircraft. The craft made no sound.;42.1726;-88.4231
