A triangular craft flying low, slow and silent;2011-03-28 11:00:00;10 seconds;A triangular craft flying low, slow and silent I was heading out to go watch a movie at the cinema and after taking a couple of steps out of my front door I looked up into the night sky and saw a triangular space craft fly silently and somewhat slowly over my house.  This craft must have been around forty feet in diameter and around one hundred fifty feet in altitude.  I was able to see a triangular outline to this craft and I was also able to see three white lights under each tip of the triangular points and a center red light.  All of these lights were under the craft since I was looking up at the craft and was clearly able to see these lights.

2 fireball figures in sky, possible UFO?;2014-06-11 21:00:00;2 minutes;2 fireball figures in sky, possible UFO? As me and a buddy were driving home we both noticed a bright circular shape in the sky, lower than a satellite but slower than a plane.  It looked like it was on fire almost like a fireball floating.   The first fireball went across the entire sky and then faded away.  Then just before driving off we noticed another fire ball even lower and brighter.  Same speed, but this one went across the sky, the lights flickered, and then immediately went black.   When that happened we both could still clearly see the figure, it was black, and triangle looking, and oddly enough it began to descend.   We could tell because the figure started to look bigger and bigger.  After a minute or so it vanished.   Very weird experience, and we are still unsure of exactly what it was.;42.1726;-88.4231
