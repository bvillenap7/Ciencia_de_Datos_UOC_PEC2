Five orange lights in diamond pattern with no sound flew slowly directly over head;2012-08-24 20:47:00;00:03;Five orange lights in diamond pattern with no sound flew slowly directly over head Aug 24, 2012 at 8:47 PM DST in Huntley, IL moving from the SSW to the NNE at about. 25-45 mph and about 200 to 400 feet above ground my wife and I first saw three orange lights in a triangle pattern.  One light leading and the other two about 100 feet behind and 30 to 40 feet apart. Then another light appeared forming a diamond pattern and then a fifth light about 100 feet behind the fourth light.  There was no sound being emitted as the lights flew directly over head. We could not make out any object creating the lights.  The night was clear and starry with very few, if any, clouds and winds were light.  The whole event took about three minutes before disappearing from sight because of trees and homes.  I tried to capture one of the lights using the movie mode on my cell phone but all that shows is a small orange light making no sound.;42.1726;-88.4231
