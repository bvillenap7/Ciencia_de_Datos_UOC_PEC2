Moving from South to North in a straight line, hundreds of feet apart.  At first look they seemed like  stars, however they were all moving in a straight light faster than a plane flies at a high altitude.  When they got to a certain point in the sky, the lights just disappeared one by one.  There were no clouds in the sky on this night.;42.1726;-88.4231
