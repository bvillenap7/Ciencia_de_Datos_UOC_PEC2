Saw these five objects going east bound, no noise, seperated, first two together, second group of three, and last one was trailing behind the others.  They appeared to be moving at the estimated speed of 200-300 mph.  After observing the objects they disappered into the clouds. Went to get video camera, but the battery was dead.;41.4288;-87.972
Orange fireball steadily moves across sky then stops for 5 minutes (not UFO, a firework caused this!);2011-07-02 22:15:00;7 minutes;Orange fireball steadily moves across sky then stops for 5 minutes (not UFO, a firework caused this!) I witnessed an orange fireball about twice the size of a bright star. It moved silently at about the speed of an airplane. I would guess an altitude of 500 feet or so.  After moving steadily across the sky nearly above me, it suddenly stopped.  It did not move for at least 5 minutes, flickering slightly once in awhile. Then it winked out and was gone.   As I have been following the reports of fireballs on this sight for nearly year, I observed this as intently as possible.  I should also mention the sky was clear.  Now here is the most important part:  I saw the fireball emerge from a firework about a block away!  I have never seen or heard of a firework like this before or know anyone who has.   Other than the fireball, it had looked like a normal firework.  Had I not known that it was a firework, I would have mistaken it for a UFO sighting.   This certainly can not explain all of the fireball sigthings out there by a long shot.  But I can tell by reading some of the repo! rts this month, that many of them are describing exactly what I saw. I consider myself a bit of an amateur astronomer, so if it almost fooled meâ€¦;41.4288;-87.972
