Tinley Park Lights Are Back!!!;2005-10-01 01:10:00;10 seconds;Tinley Park Lights Are Back!!! I recieved a phone call @ 1:10 AM on Saturday the 1st of Oct. from a family member who lives in Tinley Park Il. The first thing I heard on the phone was they're back, the red lights are back! They are a little ENE of me, can you see them? I live @ 12 miles SSW of Tinley in Manhattan Il. I was told to look to the NE of my location and sure enough there were 3 red lights in a triangle formation hovering to the NNE of me. I watched them for a few seconds and ran back in the house to get my binoculars. By the time I came back out (@20 seconds) they were out of view. My family member said they moved out of her view too, heading E. These appeared to be of the same intense red color and formation except maybe they were a little brighter and slightly larger this time as compared to the ones I witnessd last year on Oct. 31st. I am trying to convince this family member and members of her immediate family to send in a report. I was told that they saw these lights earlier in the evening, only briefly though, at @ 11:00 PM Friday night Sept. 30th. When they called me at 1:10 Saturday morning Oct. 1st, they were already viewing this second event for awhile. ((NUFORC Note:  All reports of the two sightings (23:15 hrs., 30SE05, and 01:10 hrs., 01OC05) from Illinois will be passed along to Dr. Mark Rodighier, Director of the CENTER FOR UFO STUDIES, Chicago, as well as to Mr. Dave Marler, State Director of the MUTUAL UFO NETWORK for the State of Illinois, who will pass them along to his Field Investigators in the Chicago area.   We would be most grateful if witnesses to this event would please submit a detailed report of their sighting, using the ONLINE REPORT FORM on our website, and we will pass those reports along to those two investigators above.   PD)) ((ADDENDUM TO ORIGINAL REPORT, DATED OCTOBER 21, 2005)) Addendum to my 10/01/05 Tinley Lights report. An addendum to my report of the Tinley Park lights sighting on 10/01/05: I noticed that in other reports that were posted about this event that people saw a number of meteors in the vicinity of the lights that night.  I too saw a meteor in the NW sky @ 70 degree angle from the horizon while the lights were visible.  At that time, and even now, I think it was just coincidence. It was another report that really got my attention, it was from New Lenox IL.  The individual stated that he saw 3 star light or satellite colored objects in the sky during the evening of 9/30/05 and that he never saw anything like that.  As a point of interest, I referenced in a report that I posted after witnessing the 10/31/04 lights over Tinley, that I saw a triangle formation of satellite looking lights fly directly over my house during the 8/21/04 red light sighting over Tinley.  Interesting thing is I was unaware of the red lights at the time and didn't find out about 8/21/04 sighting of the red lights untill the 10/31/04 incident.  Food for thought. I will probably file a separate report about an interesting object/light I seen last evening on the way to work.  Debating if it was a plane or not. ((END ADDENDUM));41.4288;-87.972
