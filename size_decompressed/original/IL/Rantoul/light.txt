Two white lights seen by two separate people 30 minutes apart in same location, central IL.;2016-08-24 20:15:00;30 minutes;Two white lights seen by two separate people 30 minutes apart in same location, central IL. On the evening of August 24, 2016, I was driving to Rantoul, IL, from Thomasboro, IL, along Route 45 North approximately 8:15 pm Central time, or so.  North of me a couple of miles ahead, I saw what looked like a bright star but it was too early for stars to be that bright in the north.  The sun had set, but the sky was still bright in the west.  As I got closer, I noticed that the light wasn't moving in any direction.  It wasn't blinking like a tower or a plane is required to do because of air traffic.  Then I saw that it was actually two lights right next to each other. I passed it at the intersection of Rt. 45 and Wheat Ave.  There was a line of trees for a distance before I got to that intersection and I struggled to see the lights until I passed the trees almost at the intersection.  The lights were at least 300-400 feet up in the air by my best estimate.  About as high as a tall tower, or wind turbine maybe higher, but not much. They were several feet apart from each other.  My windows were down, I was driving about 40 mph and there was no wind.  It was dead calm other than the wind from my driving and I heard nothing.  No engine noise, no rotor thumping.  And the lights were not moving, nor was there anything blinking. I drove back by the same spot at 8:45-8:50 pm and the lights were gone.   When I got home, I wrote up what I saw and posted on Facebook and a friend of mine said her son saw the same thing about 8:45 as they were also driving north.  He said the lights suddenly ‘took off’ were the words he used, towards Champaign, IL to the south.  When I asked how fast, she said it was pretty quick, because he lost track of it quickly.;40.3072;-88.1445
4th of July UFO.;2017-07-04 21:50:00;1 minute;4th of July UFO. I went outside to head to a friend's house and to the south east i saw a very bright light in the sky just hovering there, no noise other than some residual fireworks and my car dinging. At first i dismissed it thinking it was maybe a helicopter or a drone,  The light coming from it was very bright but not flooding and did not strobe or flash.  I checked a flight radar app and there where no planes in the area at all.  I took a picture of the light and a short video clip.  The area I live in is on the decommissioned air force here in town.;40.3072;-88.1445
