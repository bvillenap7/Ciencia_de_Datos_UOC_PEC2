Ufo maybe?;2016-08-24 20:30:00;0.30 minutes;Ufo maybe? I noticed a flying circular object (my mother was driving North from Champaign) in the air around 400 feet in the air with red and white flashing lights that flashed constantly, and very fast.   The object seemed to hover in the same area, but did move forwards and backwards.  Towards the South there was a storm coming up from the South and it was producing lots of lightening.  Much of the lightening was striking the ground. I lost sight of the object after about 30 minutes.  It looked as if it went to the south.;40.3072;-88.1445
