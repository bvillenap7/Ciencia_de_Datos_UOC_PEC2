Orange object in sky.;2003-12-09 19:00:00;under a minute;Orange object in sky. My and my friend were out trying out his new gun he just got, and i spotlighted a can for him to shoot, and then all a sudden, I see a huge round yellowish orange ball in the North-west sky.  And as soon as it was there it faded from the right to the left side of it.   I tell him to look up and then a second one, or maybe the same on apears to the left and up and little bit of the first on and it's same yellowish-orange color, and same shape, and then if fades just as quickly.   Then after that we both noticed alot of jet activity around the area, fast jets.   And then nothing else happened it was so called normal the rest of the time.;38.7345;-87.6806
