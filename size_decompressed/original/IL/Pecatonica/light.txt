Last night, July 3rd, 2014, my wife and six other adults saw a light that looked like a faint star rise past the north side of the moon on the western horizon.  It then sailed across the sky in a straight line, passing directly overhead only slightly south of the Zenith until if faded from view on the eastern horizon.  There was not sound.   Of the eight adults present, we all agreed that it was not blinking, and was traveling much faster than a plane or satellite, but slower than a meteor.  Our best guess was that the total time that it took to go from one horizon to the other was about 20 seconds.   Its direction of travel was about 5 degrees north of due east.;42.3083;-89.3441
