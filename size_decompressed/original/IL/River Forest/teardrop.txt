Teardrop craft with revolving lights moving in opposite direction;2002-09-27 12:38:00;7-10 Seconds;Teardrop craft with revolving lights moving in opposite direction My father and I were outside in our backyard with our binocs and telescope to try and see the stars.  When all of a sudden this teardrop craft just shoots on by traveling towards the west with about 7 or 9 dark yellow lights revolving lights around it in opposite direction of its movement.  It moved so quickly we cant describe it any more detail.;41.8936;-87.8142
