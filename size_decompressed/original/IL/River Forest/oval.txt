Glowing oval object spotted south east of O'hare;2011-02-08 17:50:00;1.5 minutes;Glowing oval object spotted south east of O'hare My son was doing his homework and faces west in the kitchen,with windows in front of him.  He looked up from his homework and saw a glowing oval shape and it hovered for about 25 seconds.  Then started to slowly move sideways, south and then took off quickly out of sight.  There was a light trail like when you waive a flash light at night.  Then about 25 seconds later a black jet a red light on the tail zoomed past in the same direction as the glowing object went.   We see air traffic from O'Hare airport all the time and we watch several more commercial jets fly by and I asked questions to determine the difference between those and the Oval object.   The oval object did not have lights that sparkle like commercial jet headlights. He saw one big glowing oval object that did not sparkle.;41.8936;-87.8142
