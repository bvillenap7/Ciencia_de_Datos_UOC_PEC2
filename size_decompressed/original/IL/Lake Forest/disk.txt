Fast moving disk seen above the north Chicago-land area heading north.;2013-11-24 19:50:00;~1 minute;Fast moving disk seen above the north Chicago-land area heading north. Traveling north on I-94 about to head west on route 60 about ten minutes until 8pm on November 24, 2013.  An oval passed from above the car out to the horizon in about 2 seconds. I say oval, but I could tell it was actually the shape of a frisbee, but from my angle, it appeared to be an oval.  We were about a half an hour north of O'Hare airport, but it was moving way to fast to be a plane.  And it was too big and had a solid white light that didn't blink or flare or leave a trail, so it couldn't have been a comet. It seemed to be about airplane height, I want to say 20,000 feet. But by the time it reached the horizon, it could have been anything higher than that.  If a plane travels 500-600 mph, I would say it was 4 to 6 times faster then that.  The best way to describe it was if I were laying on my back and a professional whipped a frisbee over my head.  Only difference is the object was clearly glowing and was very high in the air and huge. It was about the size of a skittle, maybe a little bigger from my perspective.  As I wrote, it happened very fast, but as soon as it happened, my passenger and I looked at each other and at the same time said, Did you just see that?.   I consider myself a fairly intelligent person and I cannot figure what it could have been, neither can my friend.  Thank you.;42.2299;-87.8426
