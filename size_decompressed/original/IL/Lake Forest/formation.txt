One craft lower and the second craft higher altitude. Both same shape.  Appear as lights to the naked eye but when photographed they are identical space crafts.   They appear to be concealed in the Taurus constellation but looking at the photographs they are not stars.  Appear to be flying in a spiral formation but from earth apper to be standing still.  Have asked friends to look at the sky for this, and all have seen it but no one can explain it. (on the first night of viewing this-Friday- there were aircraft that appears to be circling these objects-- like military or something very human checking it out);42.2299;-87.8426
