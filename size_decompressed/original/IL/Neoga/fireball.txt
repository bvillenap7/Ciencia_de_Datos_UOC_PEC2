Not a meteor although that is the closest thing I have seen to what I saw tonight, or even closer was watching a space shuttle re-enter orbit once.   It almost looked like a fireball or a rocket exploding as it streaked across the sky then vanished.  Quite high in the sky.  Again definitely NOT a firework.  And no sound either.  I almost thought a plane exploded at first.  Very strange.;39.3211;-88.4422
