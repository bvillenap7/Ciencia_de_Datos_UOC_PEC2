I WORK FOR JOURNAL GAZETTE NEWSPAPER DELIVERINGPAPER BUNDLES AND NEW PAPERS. WHILE DRIVINGTHROUGH A BOTTOM LAND ROAD, A CRAFT CAME OVERA TREE LINE ON A HILL JUST TO THE WEST OF METHE CRAFT MADE NO NOISE AND IT HAD HUNDREDSOF RED DOT LIGHTS ALL OVER THE BOTTOM OF ITI COULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT I WAS SEEING AND IAWATCHED IT CROSS THE BOTTOM OR VALLEY MAKINGIT WAY SOUTHEAST, I KEPT WATCHING AND TRIEDTO FOLLOW IT, BUT I HAD TO GO DOWN THE ROADABOUT 1/2 MILE BEFORE I COULD GO EAST. I WATCHIT AS I CROSSED THE BOTTOMLAND, I CAME TO AHILL THAT I HAD TO GO UP, AT WHICH TIME ILOST SITE OF IT. WHEN I GOT TO THE TOP OF THEHILL I COULD NO LONGER SEE IT. I STOPPED MYCAR AND SHUT IT OFF. I GOT OUT OF THE CAR ANDSTOOD THERE LOOKING IN ALL DIRECTION, BUT NEVERSAW IT AGAIN, IT JUST DISAPPEARED IN THE30 SECONDS THAT IT WAS OUT OF MY VIEW. IT WAS SOWIERD, NO NOISE, SO SUDDEN.
