Red revolving light in Illinois;2007-08-11 22:45:00;10 minutes;Red revolving light in Illinois We were walking in the door as I caught a light in the corner of my eye.  I looked up and it was a bright red light fairly high in the atmosphere.  My husband and my mother both saw the light and we watched it.  It stayed stationary, but it looked like it was revolving, the brightness of the light was almost the same effect a lighthouse has, as it rotates the intensity of the light became brighter.  An airplane passed fairly close to it, but it seemed to be even higher up than the airplane.  It then zipped to another spot and rotated a few more times then the light slowly disappeared, it did not move left or right it went up.  Tried to take a picture of it, but could not get a good picture with the camera we have, also do not have binoculars or a telescope to have gotten a better look.;41.8059;-89.7105999999999
20 pulsing orange orbs fly a few miles before disappearing.;2016-01-24 17:40:00;5 minutes;20 pulsing orange orbs fly a few miles before disappearing. We have seen these crafts before.  The orbs would appear in the same area of the sky, follow a straight line a few miles across, then disappear again.   The orbs pulsed from a dark red to a bright orange.  They were completely silent and they were roughly 23 of them before the last one disappeared ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) I am sorry that I forgot to mention that the sighting was at 5:40 P.M. Here are a couple of pictures and a short video. Sorry for such low quality. My phone really couldn't capture the Orange glow of the objects ((END ADDENDUM));41.8059;-89.7105999999999
