Soft glow not visible by unaided eyes, and absoultely no sounds, movment straight but swift lead objects changed.;2004-10-17 20:29:00;8-12 seconds;Soft glow not visible by unaided eyes, and absoultely no sounds, movment straight but swift lead objects changed. Visible only via binoculars, using Swift 10X80, formation moving West to East diamond like formation but front objects starting changing positions, dropped down binoculars to get unaided eye sighting but not visible and then unable to relocate as moving swiftly. Had short body but very stuby but straight short wings on sides, but gave an unusal red like glow not lights but very soft glow completely around each object, and absolutely no sound !! These were almost directly overhead going from West To East direction. Just able to make out possible wings but more stick like feature than planes, and moving this quickly should have easily heard them, also the light (glow) was very unusual. For my location this was about 45 minutes AFTER ASTRONOMICAL TWILIGHT, so doubt if these were effected by twilight. If military should have heard them ??;41.8059;-89.7105999999999
5 orange and red flashing lights flying west in a formation;2012-01-25 19:20:00;5 minutes;5 orange and red flashing lights flying west in a formation On Wednesday, January 25, 2012 at approximately 7:20 in the evening, I went to the porch door to let our dog in (east side of the house).   As I opened the door, I looked north and to the sky and saw five red and orange flashing lights moving in a formation.  I immediately ran to the kitchen and yelled for my wife.   She, along with our three children, came to the porch door and witnessed not all five lights, but some of the moving lights.  The light formation was moving west.   I walked through the house to the front door, put on my shoes and went out to the sidewalk.  I saw nothing.  I walked backwards with my eyes in the same spot and still saw nothing.   I walked north towards the end of the street and still nothing.;41.8059;-89.7105999999999
