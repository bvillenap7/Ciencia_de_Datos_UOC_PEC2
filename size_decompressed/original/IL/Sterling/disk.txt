Limited contact with ufo and aliens.;1999-12-28 05:00:00;20 minutes;Limited contact with ufo and aliens. I was on an early morning fishing trip, near Sterling, IL. I was outside of the city limits, fishing at a local canal. Behind me, I hear a rush of wind in the trees. I turned and saw a Disk hovering about 50 feet above the trees and shining a blue light on me. I was so scared at first I could not move. But then I didn't feel scared and walked toward it. It was silent and the wind had died down. Completely calm and the blue light followed me as I walked like it was leading me to it. As I got under it I could see different lights and faces looking at me but with no expression. The object was metalic black in color. I felt like I was frozen there for hours but it was more like 10 minutes. We just looked at each other. I got scared and urinated on myself. Then it slowly lifted up and shot away at an extremely fast pace.;41.8059;-89.7105999999999

It was more flat in shape, and only omitted white color.   It was northeast of the house (direction near North of Chicago).  We saw it rise straight up a significant distance at a gradual, but quick speed.  Friend said it was moving in a circular motion before telling us to come outside.  After moving straight up, it moved left at a 90 degree angle, a few minutes later it moved down in the sky about 25% the distance it first went up. Then it moved a little right, then a little up.  Over a 15 minute time period it would get bright, then move.  Before going in it faded very quickly and moved again.  It was still in the sky when we went inside the house.  We have seen it from different locations in the sky as well (directly west).  It never omits any color, and will move at sharp angles.  No airplane or helicopter noises, nor did it have the colors of those aircrafts.  Also, too far away to be a drone or helicopter.;41.8059;-89.7105999999999
