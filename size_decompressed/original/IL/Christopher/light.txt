Bright light moving slowly with what appears to be aircrafts around it.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible celestial bodies??  PD));2010-08-17 21:15:00;02:32;Bright light moving slowly with what appears to be aircrafts around it At about 21:15 I went out to have a cigarette and noticed a bright light in the sky to the east at this time I believe it was a star but after sitting and looking it appeared to be moving really slow.  I went back in and came back out again at around 22:05 and noticed it was moved to almost directly above me after watching it for about 15 minutes I went back in about 2400 I went to check it out again and did not see it so I walked to the side of my apartment and seen it again in the western part of the sky after going back in forth to check it out I started noticing what appears to be aircrafts in the general area about 6 of them on all sides I believe these were aircrafts because I could clearly see blinking colored light (RED & WHITE) with the bright light in the middle of them.  The object appears to be round with like light emitting off it in streams going in different directions.  There are a lot of stars out but nothing as bright as this.  At this time 0! 2:43 it is about a 90 degree angle from my back door just sitting there is no sound coming from it and appears to be hovering there. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible celestial bodies??
