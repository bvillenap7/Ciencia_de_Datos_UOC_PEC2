Green shape changing spot in multiple photographs East sky in morning. ((anoymous report));2017-10-08 08:30:00;2 minutes;Green shape changing spot in multiple photographs East sky in morning. I was driving south on rt23 after just turn off rt34.  I noticed the Sun in the east skies above the crop field and thought about how great that would be as a photo so i took images of the sun, realizing that my window was up and would probably make the picture not what I wanted I put the window down and took a few more images of the east sky.  As i was uploading the images I noticed a spot, since I had changed the color filter on them to negative.  I became curious and looked at the others and on the normal photos there is a bright green spot and you see it travel from the top of the crops up to the southern skies and then I had one out of focus but the shape was not a spot but looked like the planet Saturn.  All spots were that same green and turned a black when in the negative filter.  I was not able to really look at what I was shooting because I was driving though it moves in elevation while the shot is taken at a very close same position from my window.
