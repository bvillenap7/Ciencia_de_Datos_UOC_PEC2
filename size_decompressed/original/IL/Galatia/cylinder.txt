Aircraft with three large triangles of lights, one red triangle with two white triangles on each side rose from a nearby field.;2013-08-19 20:20:00;1 minute;Aircraft with three large triangles of lights, one red triangle with two white triangles on each side rose from a nearby field. At exactly 8:20 yesterday evening I was standing in my yard talking to a friend on the phone and I noticed some lights ascending from a field about 3 miles east of my house.  I thought it was a helicopter at first but I never heard any rotor blades.   As it got closer I noticed that it had three very bright triangles of lights on the front of it each being approx 50 feet from point to point, one red triangle of lights with two triangles of lights on each side of the red one.  (Approx 150 feet total).  It was about 500-1000 feet up and climbing when it passed over me, and as it passed I could hear a sound similar to a jet engine (whistling) but not very loud.   The body was hard to make out in the dark but looked like a long metallic tube... I wasn't quick enough to hang up and get a photo of it, but I called our local Central Dispatch (Police) and informed them of what I had seen.;37.8239;-88.6217
