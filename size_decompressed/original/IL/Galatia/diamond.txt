Kite-shaped thing with blue/white light flew in front of suv hovered over field to my right.;2014-12-27 05:00:00;3 minutes;Kite shaped thing with blue\white light flew in front of suv hovered over field to my right At approximately 05:00 December 27, 2014, i was on my way home from taking my mother in law to work.  Driving down the country road to get to my house, 55 miles per hour listening to the music.  This kite shaped thing flies right in front of my SUV.   It happened so fast I slammed on my brakes.  Put my car in neutral and called my mother in law.  She told me to back up and see what it was.  I put my car in reverse and see it in the field to the right of me.  It wasn't very far off the ground.   It was shaped like a kite and had these very bright iridescent white blue lighting on the bottom and side.  In a panic i drive off fast as i can!   My mother in law insisted i call police.  I refused cause i figured they'd think i was crazy.  The next road to the right was my road to take home, driving very fast ans still on the phone with her i look over to the field on my right to see if it's still there and it's up in the air flying past me over the trees and out of sight in a matter of seconds.   I began panicking!  I hung up and tried to record but it was gone.  I've never seen anything like it, was definitely indescribable, very scary to experience, left my hair standing on end.   Never in my life had i seen a ufo.  Nor do i ever want to again!!  My husband and i intend to go to the field where i seen it after it flew in front of my car today whem daylight comes. I'm extremely shook up about this.  Can someone tell me what i saw and is it harmful?;37.8239;-88.6217
