6 brightly lit low hovering objects in DuPage County.;2014-07-30 21:00:00;10 minutes;6 brightly lit low hovering objects in DuPage County. 6 bright lighted objects flying low and over DuPage County yesterday evening.  Not proper lighting to be a plane and too low, no sound to be a helicopter and we thought it could be the personal hobby droids that can be purchased but too high for that.   Baffled.   Lights flickered and were blue, red and green.  They would slowly paced and would circulate for a few minutes and then disappear.  Nothing more, nothing less.   Just curious if anyone else saw this as can't find anything else about it.;41.864;-88.0671000000002
