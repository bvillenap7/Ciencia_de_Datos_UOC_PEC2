Orange objects movie across night sky with no noise.;2015-09-25 20:10:00;5 minutes;Orange objects movie across night sky with no noise. Over 10 to 20 orange objects moving south with no noise and moving kind of in a straight line.  They seemed kind of low in altitude.   3 people saw this happen. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESSES)) Yes - this was for the anonymous source in Glen Ellyn, Illinois.  I did not manage to get a picture of all of them together.  It happened so fast and they were moving fast.  Everything was over within 5 minutes, I guess.  3 other people saw this and we are wondering why there was nothing on the news last night? First time we saw UFO's.  They did not look like anything man made. Thank you for your followup and I'm also glad someone is performing this service.
