Bright sparkling egg shaped ufo in Glen ellyn, IL exploding with colors;2009-11-03 00:00:00;1 hour.. and counting;Bright sparkling egg shaped ufo in Glen ellyn, IL exploding with colors Tonight, my husband and I were having a cigerette right after midnight it was a clear sky so we were looking at the moon and stars when suddenly we noticed a bright sparkling light in the sky.  With binoculars we were able to see all sorts of colors exploding around and circling this light/aircraft (we didn't see any actual for sure shape to determine exactly what it was but it seemed to be egg shaped) It was 4 times larger than any other star we could see including planets...  The colors were red, bright white, bright sapphire bright blue, orange with a tinge of green and a tinge of pink. This is the closest as I can describe the colors because they all were more brilliant and bolder than any color I had ever seen. It slowly moved east of our location hovered, and moved a bit south... then would hover again.  As of now it is slowly moving away.. it is so dark that none of our cameras will pick up any pictures, the camera will not let us take a picture. We changed to a digital camera, but it just came out a blank black sky, because the object had moved further away at this point. We can still see it in the distance.  It was by far the most spectacular thing we have ever seen.  We are avid sky watchers and always look at stars, planets and the sky.  You could see that the lights had motion most definitely I have seen twinkling stars before and this was nothing of the sort.;41.864;-88.0671000000002
