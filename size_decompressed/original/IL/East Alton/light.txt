It seemed tochange course slightly before disappearing,moving northwest.  This seems to have set itapart from meteorite or firework activity. See above for description.  (blue-green objectmoving east to west in southern sky overthe Alton, IL area at 9:45pmon July 4, 1997.)I'd like to add that it was brighter than anyof the fireworks that neighbors were launchingat the time.  It lit up the yard for a moment --not brightly ... but, more so than moonlightor fireworks.  Slightly less than lightning.The fact that it moved so smoothly and quicklymade me think it was a shooting star ... a closeone because of the thickness of the trail.But, it shifted course a little, heading morenorthwest than west, which I found odd.  Thenit disappeared.think is odd.;38.8775;-90.0793000000001
