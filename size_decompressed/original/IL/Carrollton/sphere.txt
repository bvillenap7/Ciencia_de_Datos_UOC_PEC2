I was taking photos of around my back yard of birds and looked up. suddenly,  There appeared three round objects in plain view in the sky, and I called for my father to come outside to see.  One due East of my location, moving very slowly, like it was floating in a westerly direction.  Another was doing the same to the Northeast.  A third, toward the Southeast was doing similar, but then after a few minutes, at a speed unthinkable to us, flew off to the south and vanished.  They made no sound.  Heavy clouds were moving in from the Northwest which first covered the one to the Northeast and we lost track of it at that point.  The one due East was visible long enough, before the clouds moved in, for me to take two photos and a brief video of it.;39.305;-90.4074
