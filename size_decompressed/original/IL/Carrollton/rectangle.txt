Strange Strobing light in the Southern Sky;2006-06-15 21:10:00;10 minutes;Strange Strobing light in the Southern Sky On this Thursday night my wife and I were sitting outside a bit after 9 p.m. and both of us noticed a strobing light in the sky. This was not lightning, at least like none I have ever seen. There were only a few thin wisps of cloud in the sky stars were plainly visible. This was a clear night. The light pulsated approximately every 10 seconds and appeared to be rectangular -- standing on end. The flash happened quickly and last approximately 10 minutes. It seemed to change location slightly from flash to flash. I held my hand out and it appeared to be about an inch long when I spread my fingers. It was in the southern sky.;39.305;-90.4074
