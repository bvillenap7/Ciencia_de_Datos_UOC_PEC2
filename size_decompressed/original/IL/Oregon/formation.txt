lights moving in the sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of the star Sirius??  PD));2006-11-08 22:30:00;over an hour;lights moving in the sky My girlfriend and I went out on the deck to have a cigarette, while looking at different stars we noticed a line formation of lights that fanned out. at first we thought it was the space station or satellite of some kind. We watched as it moved in a north west direction. But as it moved the lights grew brighter then dimmed changing and colors often from white to green, blue and red. Finding this strange we watched even longer. Soon there were clusters of lights that would move from the shape outward, they were a burnt orange color. they would fly around for a couple of minutes then go back to the shape and disappear. We watch this go on for over an hour! At one time it seemed to have moved closer to us but not close enough to make out a definite shape. I am one who has never been a believer of sightings until tonight...if anyone else saw this or knows what this was please let me know!  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of the star Sirius??
