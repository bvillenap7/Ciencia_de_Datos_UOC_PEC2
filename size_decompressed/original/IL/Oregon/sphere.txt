Very fast, white, UFO streaks across entire sky.;2014-07-02 00:00:00;5 seconds;Very fast, white, UFO streaks across entire sky Sitting watching stars.  A shooting star was seen earlier in the evening.  Then came something that at first glance appeared to be another shooting star, but it streaked across the entire night sky.  Normally the shooting stars burn out rather quickly.   This proceeded to run across the entire sky until out of view.  It was white and spherical moving at a very high rate of speed.  Size was not able to be determined due to high rate of speed and nothing against which to judge it.   It had a vapor cloud or dusting or something similar both behind and around it as it traveled.  This trail was much shorter than a typical shooting star.   I know it was not a shooting star because I had just seen one.  It was definitely not an airplane, as it was moving way too fast.;42.0121;-89.3482
