We were driving cross country to Wisconsin, and saw a bright white flashing light in the sky.  At first, we assumed it was just a radio tower or a commercial aircraft, but on closer inspection, there was no tower and it hadn’t moved in inch since we saw it.   We pulled over and decided to take a look outside our car for a couple minutes, before it stopped flashing.  After witnessing the final flash, an very light aura of blue (Barely noticeable) surrounded the area where the flashing was, and quickly disappeared as a shadow disappeared into the night sky.;42.0121;-89.3482
