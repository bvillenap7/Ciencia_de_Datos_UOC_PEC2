Triangular shaped object flying very low to the ground over my parents yard in rural Illinois.;2000-01-01 21:00:00;5 minutes;Triangular shaped object flying very low to the ground over my parents yard in rural Illinois. My two children & I were leaving my parents house in rural Patoka.  As we walked outside, we saw this huge triangular shaped object in the sky not much above the tree tops.  The object made no sound & was travelling extremely slow (almost hovering).  I yelled down for my parents to come outside.  As we all stood their watching we could see the object very plainly, as it was flying so low.  It was heading north.  It had several very bright lights & the bottom of the craft appeared to be flat.  The rest of the craft was mostly black.  The lights from the craft could be seen reflecting off of the ground.  We actually didn't have a clue what it was, but it was unlike anything any of us had seen before.  It flew north over my parents yard & then over the field across the road going north.  It seemed to pick up some speed when it got to the field, but nothing extremely fast.  My children were 10 & 12 at the time & they both remember.  My mother suggested that night that it was possibly something from Scott Airforce Base.  We all tried to accept that theory, but have since pondered what we saw that night.  We never did report it....I guess we were just afraid everyone would think we were crazy.  I was the documentary on Travel Channel a few nights ago called UFO's over Illinois.  Those officers & other eyewitness were describing the same object we seen in Janurary 2000, so I decided to go ahead & report our sighting.  Actually, it made me feel better to know that we were not the only ones to see this! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));38.7572;-89.0984
