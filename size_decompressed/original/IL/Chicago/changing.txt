Sitting in 4th floor roof garden,late summr, innercity neighborhood with dogs barking, neighbors record player, cars passing, view of Chicago skyline aprox 1 mile away.  Old  aircraft beacon sweeps the sky, to  the  rooftop on  normal rotation.  In the  beacon 2 dull silver disks about the size of  garbage can lids  sweep past aprox. 4 feet from us with accomping  swishhhhhh  noise.  WE turn to watch....mid point of  roof they take off   FAST!~~~ higher faster sound... neighbohood now  dead  quiet..no trafic,  music dogs.  GAin altidute atincreadable speed moving n/nw,  the   lights  begin...yellow/orange, green/blue carnaval ride type  colors.  They intertwine manuveing  as  they  climb. At apex they join together and disapear.  Neighborhood noise  continues, can hear   cars   strating  on main street,  music begins  mid  song on  record player. All this takes place in the time it takes to say...what was  that?  Radioactive neon bats.  Without saying  another word we returned the  apartment we both wrote a discription of the experience. Without consulting each other the doscriptions matched. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
3 shape-changing objects, interacting with each other, seen flowing southward over downtown chicago;2005-01-01 01:45:00;2 minutes;3 shape-changing objects, interacting with each other, seen flowing southward over downtown chicago There were 3 objects seen moving south over Chicago.  They were first noticed over the near-north side of the city, passing over downtown, until out of sight.  All 3 objects were the same color.  They did not appear to be emitting any light of their own, but possibly reflecting the light of the city.  The color of the objects was a muted pinkish hue, about the same color as the haze on the horrizon glowing from the city lights.  For this reason, I first thought the objects were clouds or smoke from New Year's Eve fireworks, but then I realized that the sky was perfectly clear, and 2 of the objects were changing shape in what appeared to be a controlled movement.  There was one object that appeared to be flying signifcantly higher than the other 2.  This object did not change shape.  It appeared to have wings, and looked like it could have been an aircraft, but it's shape was unlike any civilian aircraft I have seen.  The other 2 objects appeared to be lower than the first.  They followed the same path as the object above them.  These 2 objects were amorphous.  They were somewhat tubular and long, and kept twisting and contorting themselves, moving towards each other and back away, at times meeting with each other to form new shapes.  They were not moving very fast.  They were in view for about 1.5 to 2 minutes.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
boomerang shaped object hanging in the air changed shape and looked like a string then metal ball;2008-05-06 16:30:00;5 to 10 minutes;boomerang shaped object hanging in the air changed shape and looked like a string then metal ball At around 4:30pm May 6th 2008 in Chicago, Illinois (north side), I was riding the EL Train southbound and looked into the north sky.  I saw a boomerang shaped object than just hung in the sky very far away.  Did not seem to make any strong movements at first.  Hung there for about 5 minutes (or 5 minutes from the time I first spotted it). Then it started to either shift its shape or turn and appear as a string-like object.  It continued to do this for a few minutes against a blue sky.  It would get smaller and start to fade away as if moving far away or becoming invisible.  There were planes flying and it appeared to be a lot higher up than them (from my perspective). It looked similar to if you were to take a piece of string and put underwater- just floating there slowly shifting (I assume it was very large even though it was far away.  It faded away, then moments later a ball appeared, 'flew' around for several seconds (going one direction stopping abruptly then shooting off in another) then faded into a blue sky.  Half an hour later I saw a helicopter coming from that direction with lights on in the middle of the day.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

As I observed them through my binoculars, they seemed to be changing shape. One would appear as a thin line, and then it seemed to rotate, during which time it appeared wider.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
Brilliant yellow/orange star-like light seen over downtown Chicago.;2012-11-25 05:05:00;1-2 minutes;Brilliant yellow/orange star-like light seen over downtown Chicago At approximately 5:05am on November 25, 2012, I woke up and looked out of the window of my 37th floor downtown Chicago condominium.  I saw a light in the sky to the north that looked like a star, but it was much too low in the sky to be one.  It was not moving, so I knew it couldn't be an airplane. Suddenly, the light grew larger and larger the color was yellow/orange. It sparkled like a star but was equivalent in size to hundreds of stars put together.  It was the brightness of an explosion or firework, but there were no offshoots of light that fell downwards.  The light remained at its maximum size for approximately 20 seconds. It then disappeared. In its place was a dark rounded shape that began to move.  It was difficult to make out the exact shape against the dark night sky.  There were no lights on the top, sides or rear of the shape - only a multitude of small lights on the front of white, yellow and orange that alternated in a random pattern as the shape proceeded forward and down in a vertical east to west direction.  The speed of the object was about twice the speed of a descending airplane and it quickly disappeared behind a distant skyscraper.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
We saw three red and orange orbs in a triangular form in the dark Chicago sky.;2013-07-04 23:00:00;2 minutes;We saw three red and orange orbs in a triangular form in the dark Chicago sky. We were coming home from Navy Pier when we saw a red and orange orb in the dark Chicago sky facing north.  There were no fireworks at all.   I went in my alley to get a picture and better view.  When I zoomed in, the figure was moving and flickering rapidly.   We parked the car and I went back and two more objects appeared they started to form a triangle.  After awhile one started to fly and disappear.   I went inside my house and came back and they were gone.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
More Orange orbs in the night sky in Chicago;2014-08-09 02:30:00;2 minutes;More Orange orbs in the night sky in Chicago August 9, 2014,  02:30 CST  In Chicago, IL over southern Lake Michigan one other witness and I saw a ball of non-consuming flame out over the lake under what we could only describe as controlled flight. It manoeuvered like nothing we'd seen before, hugging the horizon headed north until it stopped, apparently turned, and flew straight up what must have been at least 2000 feet.  Then it stopped again and appeared to dance around in the sky, just like those chinese lanterns.. . . .  . but Chinese lanterns don't suddenly turn into a rotating trianglular formation.   The one object suddenly split into three and the new triangle of objects slowly spun around a share axis and recombined into one again. That was a fancy lantern!  Then it flew toward us at moderate speed straight overhead, and looked to the other witness like a burning butterfly in a non-consuming flame.   I admit I didn't see it so closely as to cite any flapping, to me it appeared to billow, and puff like something fully engulfed in flame.  I lost track of the object for a moment while moving to another room, trying to get a better view, but when I regained the object directly overhead, it was hurtling skyward at unbelievable speed..like I've never seen.  Even in movies.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
