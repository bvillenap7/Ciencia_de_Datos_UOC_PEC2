3 specks of light/triangle formation/got brighter&larger/moved fast to rt side of commercial airplane.;1989-06-01 00:00:00;a few minutes;3 specks of light/triangle formation/got brighter&larger/moved fast to rt side of commercial airplane. While on a commercial aircraft flying from California to Philadelphia, PA in mid to late 1989, the Captain announced that an object was coming up on the starboard side of the planem the right side.  And the Chicago tower has identified it as an unidentified flying object.  (He did not use the acrynom UFO). I was sitting in a window seat on the right side of the plane and looked out the window.  I didn't see anything except absolute blackness.  Then I saw three small specks of light in a triangle formation in the far distance.  In less than a minute, these lights had gotten brighter and larger as they quickly moved towards the plane, in straight line.  It was as though they had been catapaulted closer.  Then they stopped moving and appeared to be stationary, moving at the same speed as the plane and maintaining the same distance from the plane.  They appeared to move with us as the moon does in the night sky.  Then as quickly as they appeared, the lights suddenly started moving away.  The movement curved a little bit as they moved away.  They moved very fast but not so fast as to cause a streak in the sky.  The lights just got smaller they moved further into the distance.  Then finally fading into the dark sky. I have told my daughter, who was a toddler at the time about this story.  I'm not sure she believes me or others I have shared this story with. I'm not sure if O'Hara Airport reports these sightings by commercial aircraft, but I am a witness to one such event which they were aware of.  Does the FAA make such reports?  Are they available to the public? ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
Two strange light formations flying over Chicago at night.;2002-09-15 22:40:00;5-7 seconds;Two strange light formations flying over Chicago at night. Last night at about 10:40pm I was out at the Buckingham fountain laying down and looking at the stars trying to search for sattellites.  Then, all of a sudden, two bright lights came out of the west moving very rapidly towards the east. They were about three or four times the diameter of a bright star and it looked like they were made up of four lights: three orange lights surrounding a yellow one in the center.  From my relative perspective, the two objects were flying about three inches from each other, though the actual distance between them is unknown since I don't know the altitude these things were at.  They were flying so perfectly in formation that at first I thought it was one object.  I excitedly yelled to my girlfriend who was with me at the time to look up and see the objects.  She quickly noticed the objects too and watched with me as they flew quickly to the east horizon. As they apporached the horizon they started doing some weird, non-ballistic maneuvers that told me it was two seperate objects.  moving quickly back and forth closer to eachother and then farther apart.  We watched them until they disappeared out of sight. The entire sighting lasted about 5 to 7 seconds because the objects moved so quickly.  They also did not make a sound. The primary observer is a 25 year old student at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.  The secondary observer is a 20 year old student at the same school.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

Multiple lights hanging in sky;2005-07-09 17:15:00;17:25;Multiple lights hanging in sky Multiple bright dots of light hanging in the air. Viewed in a clear blue sky NW just of Chicago's Downtown, the objects might have been dismissed as a bunch of shiney mylar balloons.  However, balloons and birds move with the wind!  These lights were observed for 10 minutes!  They were not planes, nor fireworks, nor a light phenomena I know of.  It resembled pictures of the recent Mexico Flotilla or the 1947 Arnold film.  Multiple lights (30+) seemed to be hanging in the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

4 objects spoted over Lake Michigan in Chicago;2007-06-09 18:10:00;15 minutes;4 objects spoted over Lake Michigan in Chicago While laying on the beach at Chicago's North Avenue Beach I was observing planes and birds flying overhead in a perfect blue sky.  While following the path of one plane I noticed a silver dot in the sky of which the plane had just flown under.  Having seen this perspective I was able to observe the silver dot hovering in a motionless position high above land then disappear in what appeared to be an ascet out of the blue sky and out of sight straight upwards.  This piqued my curriosity and I questioned if what I had seen was real.  30 minutes later an orange or copper colored dot appeared which seemed to be more observable than the silver object I observed earlier.  The orange dot was hovering when suddenly two white dots appeared into sight.  The three objects hovered motionless for some moments then swayed back and forth.  Hovering in a triangle formation.  My initial thoughts were that I was seeing Mars(orange or copper color) and two neighboring stars.  I was skeptical only to the fact that I've never observed stars in the daytime much less Mars.  It also seemed that the formation was shifting from a right triangle to an obtuse triangle which took away any assumptions of planets and stars appearing stationary during the daytime.  I took pictures of the sky using my camera phone.  The quality of the camera I don't think is good enough to have captured these objects digitally.  However if someone would like to examine them I took 5 or so pictures of the sky.  I also walked over to a life guard and pointed out what I was observing.  He had no explanation of what these objects were but did see them as well once I pointed them out.  Minutes later the objects flew off in what appeared to be heading south in the sky.  Their departures were very swift and disappeared in what seemed to last less than a second.  I approached the life guard again and had asked if he still saw the objects in the sky.  He answered no and stated he saw the one object fly off.  As we tried to make sense of what we had just witnessed, another small white object started to appear.  This turned out to be a seagull's down feather descending onto the beach.  Our eyes had not been fooled.  These were not jets, clouds, or feathers.  Instead they mimicked the hours and hours of footage found documenting UFO's.  Which tells me that anyone with a trained eye can spot them.  They've been around for a long time and will continue to be.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

The objects were so bright that my girl friend was frieghtened that a plane might be on fire.    The objects contiued to dirft in a Western Direction though maintaing an organized seemingly intellegent configuration.   Due to a recent snow fall and then warming, there were low level evaporation type cloud cover, making all other types of air traffic and star/moon features not visable at the time.   The nature of the light was not like anything we have seen.   I managed to get aprox two min of film of the objects, and due to the low level clouds there is some ability to judge realative distance and definition of the lights, but cell phone cameras due leave something to be desired in resolution.  Let me know the best way of getting the footage to you.  Thank you so much for the work that you do, and if I can be of anymore help.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

I saw a number of bright objects in a high orbit over Chicago forming a Hexagonal shape they looks like twinkling stars to the naked eye.   Through a telescope they were multi-colored lights, some saucer shaped some with triangular structures moving around a dark center like a gyroscope.   The center of the hexagon looked like a dark oval object with fire or energy coming from it.   It still may be visible in the night sky will take another look this evening.  It was incredible.

Some clouds in the distance. We are familiar with the area. There is considerable air traffic into O'Hare airport. We saw three spherical silver shining orbs in formation traveling West to East below the typical airplane flight path elevation. They were traveling quite faster than typical commercial aircraft. I pointed them out to my wife. She saw them as well. They disappeared into the distant cloud formation to the east. This happened approximately 6:20 p.m. on May 1, 2021. Weather was clear and sunny. Approximately 3 to 5 minutes after we observed this event, I saw another single spherical silver shining object traveling in the same direction. This object was just as fast as the others. There was no sound coming from the objects. The formation they held and speed was incredible.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

About 15 lights (not planes as they came too close to each other) Objects going in formation. At first we thought planes but then realized some were going too close to each other. They were in a perfect line about 15 of them. About 3 came the opposite way. We saw a shooting star shortly after so could have been a shower but found weird how perfect in a line they were.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
