I opened the front door and saw what looked like a three story building on it's side just floating as if it were in water. It had many white and red lights and was very quiet and to low to be an airplane.I stood there watching and in my head trying to reason this can't be. It simply made a left turn and floated away. I used to think people who saw these things were nut cases, not anymore I belive.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
Three orange, flame lanterns slowly moving NNE over Chicago in formation on July 4, 2010 at 9:45pm;2010-07-04 21:45:00;2 minutes;Three orange, flame lanterns slowly moving NNE over Chicago in formation on July 4, 2010, at 9:45pm On the evening of July 4, 2010, my elderly father and I were watching a neighbor's fireworks display on the northwest side of Chicago.  I was looking east at about 9:45pm when I noticed what looked like a lantern with orange flames in it up in the sky.  It was slowly moving NNE.  Then I noticed that there were 3 lanterns in formation moving NNE at about 20 mph.  I thought they were part of some type of airplane until I noticed that I could see distant fireworks within the triangle formed by the 3 objects. My father's eyesight is not as good as mine and he did not see the objects clearly.  He did report seeing dim lights but nothing clearly. The objects were moving in the exact same direction and speed.  One object was in the lead and the other two were at the same altitude following.  All objects appeared to be like flames – orange and flickering. It appeared that the flames were encased in rectangles.  The objects were bigger than stars but much smaller than the moon.  I would estimate the objects to be 20 feet high by 15 feet wide, at about 500 feet altitude, approximately a half mile away.  The objects continued to move NNE until they were out of sight.  There was no sound coming from the objects. I am a 50-something homeowner and have an MBA.  I have never seen nor reported anything like this before.  My eyesight is good for distance and I was not under the influence of any intoxicants.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
Low flying brown rectangular object;2012-02-26 21:00:00;15 seconds;Low flying brown rectangular object My brother and I were out for a cigarette on his third story porch enjoying the crescent moon with Venus and Jupiter near it shining in the clear night sky.  We were in the Lakeview neighborhood looking west.  We were commenting on how many airplanes were in the sky waiting to land at O’hare. I first noticed a dark shape moving low in the sky trending N/NW.  At first I thought the moon had given me a sunspot and my eyes were deceiving me.  I pointed at it and my brother couldn’t see it at first.  It then passed above a street lamp and he saw it as well.  In the light it appeared brownish.  It was closest to being rectangular, long and thin, but instead of the “wingspan” being in the horizontal direction it was longest from top to bottom.  It was very low, appearing to be perhaps ten feet above the 3 story apartments across the parking lot. It flew very steadily and without much change in elevation or speed for about 75 yards before we lost sight of it. There were no lights on it, so I at first thought it may be an owl.  It seemed too large to be an owl and did not ever flap its wings, not to mention it would be gliding in a straight line, completely on its side if it were a bird. From my perspective I would guess the object was between 5 and ten feet from top to bottom and maybe 1 to 2 feet in width.  We had no perception of its depth from our view point, but I got the impression it was thin like a wedge.  It was moving between 10 and 20 mph on a night with winds out of the SW at 2-11 mph. There is a street below, but there are far too many trees for something to be attached to a car on the street or for someone to fly a kite.  There is also an EL train that trends in the same direction as the object moved.  It is unlikely we would be able to see something attached to the top of a train from that distance and viewpoint, but we are close enough to be able to hear trains go by with ease.  There was no train going by.  If it were something attached to the train it would have to be 30 feet or so above the train to be able to see it from that spot. Neither of us are UFO watchers or enthusiasts of any sort.  I liked the movie Independence Day, but that is about as far as I go with UFO’s.  I would appreciate any suggestions on what we might have seen.  My brother thought maybe a large trash bag was blowing in the wind, but he and I agree that it was far to steady in its shape, trajectory and speed to likely be a trash bag.  It also seemed to be going faster than the wind would allow.  A trash bag would probably undulate, while this object seemed rigid.  Any ideas?;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
Large grayish rectangle outlined in the sky;2012-06-02 14:00:00;5 seconds;Large grayish rectangle outlined in the sky I was driving with my wife mid-afternoon on June 2, 2012, eastbound on I-90 Kennedy Expressway in Chicago.  I had passed O'Hare a couple miles back, when I noticed a rectangle in the NE sky similar to a drive-in movie screen.   At first I thought it was a new billboard and then I realized it was way far in the distance and very high in the sky, about 45 to 50 degrees above horizontal.  There was no visible support for the rectangle and the sky out over Lake Michigan was only slightly hazy.   I was about to point it out to my wife when traffic and buildings obscured my view for a quarter mile or so, and I was never able to catch sight of it again. I am a pilot and post this as a matter of interest.  I realize there is at least one possible explanation, that of an aircraft towing a banner.  Although this did not appear to be what I saw.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

Partally Transparent Rectangle that went full transparent;2018-11-30 13:00:00;1 minute;Partally Transparent Rectangle that went full transparent On November 30, 2018, I was traveling on Northwest Highway in Chicago.  It was approximately 1:00pm and it was a clear, sunny day.  While sitting in traffic, I looked up and ahead through my windshield and saw what I can only describe as a “transparent flag” moving North to South.  I looked carefully to make sure it wasn’t a bag or garbage, but it was much too high in the sky for that.  It was not a sign being pulled by a small plane, as I would have certainly seen the plane on such a clear day.  The object was moving in a very steady, deliberately North to South and a steady pace. Imagine a flag waving in the sky, but it’s transparent, and because it’s waving, the transparency is a little distorted.  That’s how I was able to make out its shape.  I looked out  my driver side window to make sure it wasn’t simply my view through my windshield.  It was not.  The object was still there.  I saw it for a full minute, then it slowly went to what I can only describe as “full transparency”.  Again, not a cloud in the sky.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
