It moved very fast like i said. It moved then stopped, went back the other way, stopped, hovered for about five seconds. Then a light came down from it, went away about 3 seconds later. Then the craft moved up so far we couldnt see it. There was only one. Me and my friend are students. I am in 7th grade and he is in 6th grade. My friends dad was driving us to the game. I am a very mature person. After the event I researched about UFO's. I read The Day After Roswell and numerous other books.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

Alien healing.;1998-08-01 03:00:00;2 minutes;Alien healing. A light came threw the window early morning on a Sunday, which woke me up.  The window was covered almost all the way except for an opening left at the very top in which the bright light came threw.  Next, as I wondered what it could be, a being came right threw the covered window like a ghost would go threw walls,  I began to think 'act frighted' when this being told me in my own voice don't worry everything's going to be OK all of a sudden I became calm.  Suddenly it started to walk around my bed and that's when I realize I couldn't move my body only my eyes.  I followed this being with my eyes, had the impression it was a female.  This being had long dirty blond hair, big eyes, a slit for a mouth, and two little holes for a nose, its skin was a blueish-greenish color. It stand next to my bed and again in my own voice it told me that everything was going to be OK. It sat down on the side of my bed, reached over and began to massage my bad knee in which I had p! roblems walking and going up stairs and not to mention the pain I had with this knee all day just relaxing it. Next thing I know I woke up not realizing what happened over night and started walking to the bathroom and that's when it hit me, my pain was gone. I began to jump up and down and jiggled my leg and that's when I was puzzled, and the suppose dream I had popped in my head. I don't know what happened but my pain which I had been going threw for years was gone after that incident and I don't know what to think about it. Till this day my knee is fine.

It has been boring night and my friend just dropped me off @my apartment by school... We have been sitting @huck(a local restraunt) and chatting about shtuff.  We left.  As we were finishing up the conversation in front of my building, we both witnessed a single very bright white light(this was definately not an airplane... to bright to be one.  I live around Midway-O'hare airport and I see planes all the time@night.  this assure you this was no plane.)  sorta fly  in a straight line from the NEE sky out to the NNW sky.  It caught our attention, but we didn't mention it to eachother until it sat there for a second and suddenly did a loopdee loop in the sky. It looked like a plane that went bunk-whack.  It was the wierdest thing that i have ever seen.  ANyway, after it did the loop it shot off into the NE sky out of sight.  It flew... very very very very very very very fast.  I have honestly never seen anything like it. We thought that it might be a plane, i tried to convince my friend of it being some gov't thing... but then a normal plane crossed the air and it was definately not that.  If you take the brightest light that plane has and triple that light... Anyway that's my story. I shall give you more info below...;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
Bright, very big, white light over Chicago;2001-09-16 19:00:00;about 1 min.;Bright, very big, white light over Chicago While visiting my mother in Chicago on this night I was standing out in her yard to get a break from all the news and looking up in the sky for any site of airplains, as this weekend it would be rare to see any. I felt like something was behind me so I turned to look at the sky just behind me maybe to the north. I am horrible with direction. There was a very bright light that at first I thought was a star but, it seemed too bright and too close to be a star. I have seen this before in our places but on this night it scared me a bit. When I saw it I had just enough time to think to myself that that was too big and bright to be a star and it very quickly faded as if it went straight up in the sky. There was no other motion or sound from that direction but, a minute latter a plain did fly over near where the light was. The light itself was a very white , star like light that faded very fast as if it went straight up. It was about twice the size of normal stars and the sky around was clearer than normal with more than normal amounts of stars visible. I could not make out any movement after the light faded and there were on visible egdes of any kind that I could see around the object. I have always watched the skies to see stars and lived where a lot of plains and stuff can be seen. (Huntsville , AL) so I know what is normal aircraft and have seen copter lights a lot. I am also a critical reader of UFO information though, I do keep up on the topic. I have no idea what this was but, I would like to know if anyone else saw it in more detail.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

2 soft white lights, one disappears and reappears quickly next to the other during a sunset.;2003-11-19 16:31:00;5 min;2 soft white lights, one disappears and reappears quickly next to the other during a sunset. was driving down I88 West, heading towards Aurora. I began seeing 2 soft white lights about ...maybe...a mile ahead of me. it happend like this. was driving on expressway (I88W) and about 4:30 I saw the first star on the horizen. there were no other stars i can see. the sun was just setting. about 2 inches to the right of a star i saw another light. it was much softer and not as well defined, i thought it was also a star. a minute or so latr i saw another light that also looked like a star soft white light. it was also to the right, but maybe a half an inch to the right of the star and about an inch below. i watched them because it seemed like the 2nd light was moving slowly towards the 1st. then when the second reached about half way it disappeared. now i was interested. so, there wasn't much traffic, so i kept watching. i still could see the first light, and i didn't seem to move, relative to me (probably it was moving in the same direction as i was. then the 2nd  light reappeared next to the 1st light (in a few seconds which seemed fast to me), but it was a little dimmer. then the 1st and 2nd lights faded away. i couldn't see any ship, but it was unusual since this happened during sunset and there was still a lot of light. also, the lights were such a soft white light that i didnt see any glare (like how a star or airplane has that makes it appear like a sharp pointy star shap), it was more of an absence of color. i think that is what made me take notice. but when the 2nd light disappeared, that was strange.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
Large Star Moved Across Night's Sky;2004-07-11 03:00:00;a few seconds;Large Star Moved Across Night's Sky It was a beautiful night's sky, clear and full of stars. I was looking out of the window towards the East. I was gazing up at the moon, the stars and at the large star, Sirius (I believe that's what it's called) it was twinkling, as usual. Then from the corner of my eye I saw a huge star that was once still, suddenly dart off, going Southeast. It was much larger than the other stars. It moved at an incredible speed. It was bright white and circular in shape. Familar with planes flying over, it clearly had no blinking red and/or white likes, like planes. And usually, at night, you can barely see the plane, except for it's blinking lights, whereas this was completely covered in white light and was very bright. As it increased in speed, it moved across the sky in a horizontal direction, then it began moving upward on an angle, going higher and higher. Then all of a sudden it disappeared.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

The light looked as though it was not moving, just hovering. After a few minutes the light faded rather abrubtly. I thought it possible to have been Venus as it is visible with Saturn at night, but I did not notice it when I first got on the expressway and I am not sure if Venus is still visible at that time.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

I was walking my dog at early in the morning hours when I looked up at the sky which was very clear that morning.   I usually look up to look at the stars at some point when im walking my dog. I was standing at the North East corner of 5600 S. Normandy when I saw a red light in the sky which was moving slowly from Southwest to Northeast.  I reside near Midway Airport in Chicago so I see airplanes all the time.  But this did not appear to be an airplane because it just appeared to be a RED light which didnt flicker on and off like on an airplane.  Also, there are usually some white lights as well as flickering red lites on airplanes.  There was absolutely no engine noise which was odd because at 4am my neighborhood is so quiet you can hear a pin drop.  After staring at this red lite for few minutes my neck got a little sore and i guess i convinced myself that perhaps it was an airplane.  I didnt think much of it so i continued home with my dog.  Early this morning I was catching up on reading my Sunday Southtown Newspaper which featured a story about people who saw a simliar lite or lites in the sky. That's when I started to think about what i had saw early sat. morning.  Im a Police Officer and i see lots of strange things in my line of work but they can usually be explained. Im not really sure what i was i saw but since others have obviously come forward I figured I would report what I saw.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

Different colors, such as red, blue, white, with a bit of yellow and green flashed across it.  Its movements were remarkable, as it seemed to move abruptly left to right, up and down, in a zigzag motion, and in between it just hovered.  It's still visible, although it seems to be leaving, as it has grown dimmer and harder to see the different color flashes.  It's up far too high in the air to be a helicopter.  When it was closer, the flashing lights seemed to be moving in such a way as to indicate a disk shape. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible twinkling star.  PD));41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

I was shocked since so many people have seen this movie over and over and since Spielbeg is SO big in UFO movie history.  I was even move shocked when I searched google and found a link to a report on this website! Of course this is a most unusual type of siting for this website.  The lights are optical artifacts from the camera equipment.  The go in and out of clouds in the background and change speed and direction.  My only quetion is, did Spielberg, who is obsessed with UFOs/aliens even to the point of lying to people about his birthday so that it matches the Roswell crash.. add this in as a special effect, or did he just get lucky during filming and capture a real UFO on film?;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

Last night my boyfriend and I were walking to his apartment on Columbia Avenue in Chicago when we saw a low-flying light crossing the sky moving south to north.  The light was quite bright and low enough that my first thought was that it was a flare being fired from somewhere nearby.  I said, What the f*** is that?, but the light vanished before I finished the sentence.  The light did not fade out or burst like a flare or fireworks would, it just vanished in the blink of an eye.  The light was also moving in a straight line, like a flying object and not something shot into the sky (which would presumably travel in an arch across the sky).  It was moving quite fast before it disappeared.  The object was moving so quickly and was so bright my boyfriend and I were stunned into silence when it vanished.

I live on the southside of Chicago in a neighborhood called Mount Greenwood. I got off of work around 11:30 PM on Wednesday, June 18th,;2008-06-19 00:30:00;All night and morning;I live on the southside of Chicago in a neighborhood called Mount Greenwood. I got off of work around 11:30 PM on Wednesday, June 18th, 2008.  I went home and everything seemed normal until i went outside for a cigarette around 12:30 AM Thursday, June 19th.  I noticed out of the corner of my eye a quick flash of light. When I looked up, I saw an EXTREMELY faint light moving in very erratic patterns at an unbelievably fast speed.  Basically, it was zig-zagging in all different directions at a brightness and speed that made it hardly even noticeable. I went to go wake up my little brother and show him. He said he saw it too, but didn't give it much thought and went back to bed. I sat out there and watched for a bit longer until I noticed that the zooming, zig-zagging lights were EVERYWHERE. They weren't birds, nor shooting stars or airplanes or jets.  This is unlike anything I have ever seen before.  I went upstairs to film this happening on an old video camera that we have had since the 90's.  The camera did a very poor job picking up anything too strange because of how dark it was outside, the age of the camera, and the faintness of the lights. To make sure I wasn't going crazy, I called one of my friends to come over and watch the sky with me and he agreed. I got in my car to go pick him up. We got back to my house about ten minutes later, and this is when the weird stuff started happening.  Instantly, I noticed that there were more stars out than there were before I left.  I looked up and I saw one of them hovering, moving in very small circles.  This was not some star obscured by clouds as skeptics may say.  This thing was moving.  THEN we noticed that the moving light began shooting out other lights.  When they would shoot out, a very small trail of vapour was seen behind them but only for a second.  After a while, we noticed some patterns.  The lights really only moved when they shot out other lights (except of course those faint zooming zig-zaggers which went on all night). Also, we noticed just how many lights formed triangle shapes in the sky.  Most noticeably were three very bright lights which seemed to be directly above my house which formed an almost perfect triangle.  We continued to watch this amazing display until about 2:30 AM until my friend wanted me to give him a ride home. I dropped him off and came back ten minutes later.  Well, I ended up staying awake and watching the sky until about 5:30 AM because i was so mesmerized and frankly, a little scared.  The same things happened until I went to bed. As a sidenote, I should aslo mention that police ad ambulance sirens could be hear literally ALL NIGHT LONG.  there were non-stop sirens going on for at least 4 hours straight. I don't know if this has to do with anything, though. I woke up very tired and sore in the neck (probably from staring up all night) around 7:00 AM because I had class to go to at 8 AM.  As I was driving to school, I couldn't help but notice that the zoomers were still there!  Well I went on through the rest of the day until I had to go to work at 2:00 PM.  I had told only one specific co-worker about the whole situation last night because everyone else would just laugh at me.  We waited until it was dark (probably around 10 PM) when I dragged him out of the warehouse that we work at to come outside and see for himself. I pointed out to him one of the clearly moving lights, but he just denied it.  He said it didn't look like it was moving at all. I got kind of upset, but he told me to just go home that night and film the sky because the camera wont play tricks on you like your eyes might.  So I did again, around 11:30 PM when I got off work.  I had a half an hours worth of tape but I only filmed maybe ten minutes of footage. The triangular star formations were still there, and I saw a very fast vapor streak in the sky which seemed to come down straight to Earth about 20 miles away.  After about five minutes (which seemed like an eternity) I started getting really nervous, paranoid, and itchy.  I felt like I was being watched. I couldn't do it any more. I was feeling so weird, I just ran inside and reluctantly went to bed. I woke up today (Friday, June 20th) feeling just fine.  I haven't even bothered to look up at the sky yet.  My friend is coming back in town from his school out in Dekalb, Illinois (NIU).  I plan on showing him tonight and telling him what I saw. We may or may not see something, and depending on how I'm feeling, I may not even care. I have been worrying myself sick these past couple days and these strange lights have given me an unhealthy obsession with the sky. All I really want to know is if anybody else from my area reported similar stories. Thanks for reading.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

Multiple blinking orange orbs over downtown and north side of Chicago;2008-08-22 23:00:00;1 hour;Multiple blinking orange orbs over downtown and north side of Chicago I live in a downtown Chicago high-rise (in the River North neighborhood, immediately north of the Loop) above the 45th floor with a view to the west and northwest.  At 11pm on Friday, August 22, 2008 I went out on my balcony to get some air and saw in the distance approximately five blinking orange orbs in close formation hovering about 500 feet above the western side of the River North neighborhood (possibly a bt further west, above River West).  Very quickly the objects individually blinked on and off in a seemingly random manner, almost like a strobe light atop an emergency vehicle.  I thought at first they were the lights of an emergency helicopter (sometimes I see medical flights to rooftop helipads at hospitals on the north side), but the lights just hovered and blinked, moved slightly to the south, and faded out/stopped blinking.  While on, the light they gave off was an intense orange, the kind you might see at the working end of a blow torch.  Really pure, really bright and intense. I stood there for several minutes wondering what I had seen.  Twice in the past year, I have seen individual unexplained objects above downtown Chicago and the western suburbs (one of which I reported to NUFORC), and I expected what I had just seen was also out of the ordinary. After waiting for the lights to return to no avail, I returned to my apartment.  About half an hour later, through my window I noticed an individual blinking orange orb in a different location but near to where I had seen the original formation.  This orb was low to the ground, about at rooftop level.  It strobed for a few seconds and then disappeared. I went out on the balcony again and waited.  About a minute later, the light reappeared for 10 seconds or so and then faded out.  It occurred to me if the grouping of lights I had originally seen had broken up, I might see other individual orbs above the city. I stayed out on the balcony for about half an hour (by now it was around midnight or maybe a little bit later).  During that time, I witnessed another very intense blinking orange orb above the Lincoln Park neighborhood.  This was not the signal light atop Children's Memorial Hospital on Lincoln (which was also clearly visible) but was east of it, closer to the park itself.  This light moved slightly east and west while I watched it, and blinked in a rapid, staccato manner in three volleys of about 15 seconds each, with gaps of perhaps 15 or 20 seconds between each volley.  The light was as intense as the others I had seen, and seemed weirdly bright given the distance from which I was viewing it.  I had the feeling something was being surveyed by the light at specific intervals.  After a couple of minutes, this light disappeared and did not return. I also saw what may have been blinking orbs in two other locations, both much further to the northwest and closer to the horizon.  However, due to the distance, although those lights were blinking in the same odd manner, I can't be sure.  However, the formation of lights and the two individual orbs that I saw were identical in behavior. The funny part of the entire event, each time I saw the lights I thought, you're kidding, these can't be what I think they are, and then a few minutes later they would reappear doing the same things I doubted I had just seen them do. I've lived in this high-rise for years and have seen hundreds of planes and helicopters come and go.  I have never, ever seen anything like what I saw tonight.  I looked through the NUFORC reports and found a similar report of orbs over Lake Michigan exhibiting similar behavior on AUgust 8th.  I get the feeling I just saw those same orbs, only this time over the city.  I can't be the only one to have seen these things tonight.

Ball of light hovering near Midway airport...;2008-08-25 23:55:00;5-8 sec;Ball of light hovering near Midway airport... I was in my car in a parking lot waiting for my dad to come out from work,near midway airport. I was looking out the window when one white light moving fast from south to north caught my attention. From where I was it looked like the size of a street light,just a round white ball of light. Now I mentioned I was by Midway airport so there are planes landing often but they usually are moving slower and flying lower as they are about to land. The object i saw had no lights on its side like planes and made no sound,but was moving faster then a plane would at high altidude. I saw it for a total of about five seconds, it moved in straight line. I lost track of it behind trees of in the distance.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
slow traveling light disappears;2008-11-27 05:23:00;under 5 minutes;slow traveling light disappears On Thanksgiving Morning apporximately five thirty in the morning my family and I were traveling west bound on I-295 towards Milwakuee, Wisconsin.  We were near O'hare airport when I looked up and observed a bright light.  I watched it with interest because I didn't think it was a plane as it was traveling slow and had no blinking lights on it.  I was still watching it when we went under and overpass and when we drove out a second later where the light sould have been, and it vanished.   A couple of minutes later I saw other craft flying low over the chicago area.  I don't know the chicago area very well, and all I know is that they looked to just be hovering over hotels and buildings.  I did mention what I saw to my husband, but he is a skeptic and was just getting annoyed at me.  So I went back to sleep.  I forgot about the sighting until recently.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

Odd pulsing lights west of Chicago;2009-07-21 12:30:00;20 seconds;Odd pulsing lights west of Chicago Early Tuesday morning my friends and I noticed two air planes with pulsing lights about 45 degrees north of the southern horizon, heading west.  A few moments later I noticed they had stopped moving.  At first I thought they had just moved past the horizon.  Considering the speed and distance to the trees below I quickly ruled that out. When I got up to make sure it wasn't an asteroid or space junk they started up again.  They moved independently of each other and a third (dimmer or farther) light appeared.  With in a few more seconds one quickly headed south and out of sight and the other two continued in strange little loops speeding up before entering behind some clouds.  I am an amateur astronomer and I am pretty sure it wasn't anything burning up in our atmosphere or Jupiter or Saturn.  They moved just a little too awkwardly to be planes.   Not sure what it was, just thought I would post it here in case anyone else saw it.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

Me and my friend were watching the Metorer shower.  We noticed what we thought was a star in the sky was in fact a ufo.  It was moving to the left of the sky and after a while it just disappeared from the sky.  It was too high up to be a plane, moving too slow to be a meteor, and stars don't move.  This was clearly a ufo. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
Amber/orange unknown light;2010-06-05 21:00:00;1-2 minutes;Amber/orange unknown light Leaving a Saturday night game at White Sox park to go to a parking north of park anf parallel to the Ryan expressway, my daughter and I observed a very bright amber/orange light to the north over the skyline of the downtown area.  It seemed to be much larger than a star and was flickering....we were walking with the crowd and observing over our left shoulders and could not detect movement of the light...we looked away for a few seconds and when reaching the parking lot and looked again to see the light, it was gone.  There were no stars visible as the entire area was covered by a cloud layer and there were no airplanes in that part of the sky at that time. My daughter said it was similar to the type of light she had seen in the skies over the southwest suburban Chicago area in a fixed triangle formation on the night of July 4th, 2008;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

Orbs of lights 13+ in waves flying west near Midway airport.;2012-03-07 22:30:00;15 minutes;Orbs of lights 13+ in waves flying west near Midway airport. At around ten thirty I let my dog out in the back yard, I was letting her do her business and I was starring at the moon while there was a break in the clouds. I saw one bright orb moving west pretty fast, then I noticed it was one of three in a triangle pattern flying at same speed/ same distance apart. I kept looking up and saw more of these lights. Some came in pairs of two's and a couple more times in a triangle pattern.  Maintained the same speed and kept the same distance apart, also they all moved east to west.  No blinking lights on any of these, no signs of being planes.  I have lived near Midway airport all my life and I know how to distinguish planes.  I was just stuck watching as waves kept coming.  I went up to get my cell phone but the lights were to far to show up on my cell phone camera. I told my mom to come and check them out as we were watching more pairs pass my father came home from work and joined us.  He grabbed his binoculars and saw just a! solid color some were green some were orange.  This went on for at least 15-20 min before the cloud cover became to much, but through the patches and breaks in the clouds I saw at least 13-15 of these balls.  Im not sure what they were but me and my family were just awed by how many kept coming and the frequency.  I know this was the night the big solar flare was suppose to hit us, not sure if this could have anything at all to do with this event.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
Red lighted object over the Northside of Chicago and north suburban area.;2012-03-18 19:40:00;1 minute;Red lighted object over the Northside of Chicago and north suburban area. Very clear night.  My wife and I were crossing the street to visit a neighbor when we saw a bright red lighted craft coming from the south to the north.  Both of us thought it was a helicopter at first because of its height but quickly realized that it was making no sound.  There were other aircraft in what I would call their normal patterns heading toward and away from Ohare Airport but this one was lower than all other aircraft and on a level flight path.  It passed nearly directly above us and was was, again, a solid red lit object...no other colors and no strobing or blinking as everyone other craft is outfitted with.   We couldn't tell what the exact shape or size was  but it was larger than a helicopter and smaller than a commercial craft.  It wasn't  traveling at an amazing rate of speed and continued north with a slight curve east toward Lake Michigan.  At the last moment I pulled out my cell phone and snapped a couple of pictures of it  because we thought it was on an intercept course with a blinking plane flying from the east but the pictures just show two light dots...of the red craft and the plane which was decidedly higher.   The red light craft continued at its constant rate and left our field of vision behind the houses and trees to our N/NE.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
Mysterious pink/purple orbs in the Chicago night sky traveling at great speed and high altitude.;2012-06-17 23:40:00;30 seconds;Mysterious pink/purple orbs in the Chicago night sky traveling at great speed and high altitude. I was standing outside my house on Chicago's Far Northwest Side approximately twenty minutes before midnight on Father's Day, 2012.  I routinely see two stars on a diagonal line in the southwest sky each evening and, when I glanced up into the sky, I thought I saw these stars in a new position.  But I was in error the 'stars' were visibly two pink or purple lights, approximately two to three inches apart (using my fingers as a measuring instrument), one directly behind the other.  The lights didn't blink, but they weren't constant, either.  They appeared to pulsate, and the lights were rather dim.  From the moment I first noticed them, their transit took approximately twenty to thirty seconds.  I couldn't detect any shape of aircraft, there was no sound, and visibility was very good - no clouds or other distractions were in view.  Given the precision with which the lights were following one another, I originally thought they might be emanating from one craft.  But the second light suddenly picked up speed and either 'joined' the first light or flew frightening close to the first light as its 'wingman'.  I have no way of determining the altitude these craft were flying but, given the clear night, lack of sound and inability to detect any shape behind the lights, I would assume they were flying at a very high altitude.  And if this is the case, they were indeed traveling at an enormous rate of speed. I live a few miles from O'Hare International Airport, and my family and I are accustomed to seeing aircraft in their final approach and take-off from the airport every five minutes or so almost constantly.   The sky was quite busy tonight with inbound/outbound aircraft, but these hazy pink orbs were not coming from O'Hare, nor were they headed toward the airport.  Their flight plan was very obviously in contrast to any local aircraft traffic in this area, and could very well have posed a hazard to navigation for the surrounding pilots. These were not helicopters, flares, ultralights or any other aircraft known to me.  I am unaware of pink or purple lights used on any commercial or private aircraft, nor am I aware of any FAA regulations permitting such colors to be used within extremely close proximity to the nation's second-busiest airport. I would very much like to uncover exactly what these lights were.  I am a veteran Navy intelligence officer and have two combat deployments to my credit.  I have over sixteen years worth of experience with a wide array of aircraft, and yet I have never seen anything like this before.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

At that moment, I knew this was not an ordinary object in the sky.  I grabbed everybody's attention to witness what I just saw.

Half a second  after vanishing a bright burst of light appeared a fairly large distance away and beneath UFO.  The object may have jumped that entire distance within the time it took to flash another time.

I moved to the window to pull the shade down and noticed an odd group of lights in the southern sky.   As we are in the city (Chicago) and cannot often see stars, it was so compelling that I called my husband to observe this with me.  Eight to twelve lights grouped together in formations (2, 4).   Once they grouped together, they began to move at a very fast rate traveling straight UP...in a straight line.   This was mind-blowing for us as there was a distinct formation and a clear ascent straight upward.  We will never forget this.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

Around 1945 last night, I witnessed a stationary, but extremely bright and flickering light in the sky, almost like a stationary fireball.  I was looking eastward from my balcony, and the light appeared to be maybe a couple of miles or so off the shore of Lake Michigan out over the water. I initially assumed this was a plane, but it was definitely stationary so I ruled that out.  Then I figured it must be Mars or Jupiter because the object had a reddish hue to it and was relatively low on the horizon, but after checking a star gazing app, I confirmed both Mars and Jupiter were in opposite skies from the object.   Next, I assumed a Chinese lantern, but this didn't seem likely from the start. The object was extremely bright and looked like a flickering flame. There were very strong wind gusts on the night of 10/17, so this object remaining stationary for an extended period rules out the lantern because it certainly would not have sat still given the strong winds. I went about my way and checked maybe 30 minutes later and the object was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

I was on a class trip from Chicago to D.C., and upon our arrival home back to Chicago at 8:11 P.M. is when I saw it, at first it was simply a couple of lights moving ever so slightly fading in and out but then more lights arrived towards the right side of my window.  (Note that the lights were very far away so I do not know the size or if this was a physical craft or simply a light.) more and more began to appear and I managed to capture all of it on my IPhone 6S. According to my Iphone, the location of the video begins at Coyote Run Golf Course, before my landing at Midway International Airport.  There is no sound in the video and this may be because my headphones were plugged in at the time because I was watching a downloaded television series.  Although I don't know if that is the reason, I beleive it to be that it was the result of my faulty headphone microphone. My friend, who I told the entire experience to wanted to see the video but I couldn't send the video because it was to big to send, so he insisted on me posting it on YouTube which I did, in case anyone had any questions about my video who wasn't my friend I put all the basic information in the description. I do not have any explanation for the aircraft I saw, this was a UFO because this wasn't my first sighting, I had another sighting down the street from my own home, (26037 Whispering Woods Circle).  I don't know if they are connected to me in some way or if it is simply an improbable coincidence.  I ask that you respond because I too research and soon investigate UFOs and other paranormal and supernatural phenomena, I am no fraud I simply think that I should report this because I believe that my story along with everyone else's have a right to be heard.

My location is:   https://www.google.com/maps/place/41.894104318285216 -87.64494731656441/@41.894104318285216,-87.64494731656441,17z;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
Red light seen over Lake Michigan from Chicago over Sears Tower. 30-40 minute. Color changes.;2018-07-04 22:30:00;30 minutes;Red light seen over Lake Michigan from Chicago over Sears Tower. 30-40 minute. Color changes too My wife and I were on our rooftop to watch fireworks on the 4th of July 2018. We have a clear view of The Sears Tower (Willis Center) which is about 2.5 miles away.  I noticed a red light, a bit brighter than what we typically see on top of building or tall antenna for aviation purposes. We also could see that all the buildings had their own red light(s) on top for identification purposes.  The thing that I noticed very quickly was that this red light was above the Sears Tower beacons by a long shot and was no way a part of that buildings antennas. The red light would stay solid for about 20 seconds then off for about 2-3 seconds, back on for about 5 seconds, back off for 2-3 seconds and finally stay on for 20-30 seconds.  This process lasted about 10-15 minutes.  Then the light moved in a completely straight horizontal motion, did the blink sequence and moved back to where it was.  It then moved in a completely straight vertical motion down above another building, eventually moving back up.  These movements were not fast nor slow but for the distance we were viewing from the movement was probably in fact very fast. At the end of this viewing the light switched from green to red and back to red several times and also did a white light blinking sequence for about 5-10 seconds before finally staying red.  These color changes all happened while sitting in one spot at a time.  We finally decided to leave the roof top because a large lightning storm was approaching and the winds were very strong.  In fact we could see the larger fireworks being blown northeast into the wind quite dramatically.  That was also very strange to see this light not moving with the wind as a drone or helicopter might. My first reaction was a helicopter but I have never witnessed a helicopter move in right angles so precisely.  My wife suggested a Drone but I don't believe a drone can stabilize so well in 20-30 winds and if I had to guess this light was probably 3k-7k above the lake.  From our vantage point the light would have been closer to southeast Chicago or possibly even Indiana. When we got back into out apartment I was excited to get my spotting scope set up to look at it but of course it was not there nor did it reappear for the next hour or so while we stayed awake.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
Large white light visible over Lake Michigan;2019-06-28 04:00:00;5 minutes;Large white light visible over Lake Michigan I looked out my east facing window and thought I was looking an early morning moon in the mid-horizon over Lake Michigan.  I thought the moon was obscured by the clouds which was creating an effect of partial visibility.  The light disappeared and I thought it had gone behind the clouds.  I opened the night sky app and pointed it in that direction, and there was no moon there!  Oddly, at the same time, I saw two moving lights, going north to south.  These appeared at first to be in the far distance, but as I tracked them visually, they were decreasing in altitude and appeared between myself and the buildings in front of me.  I suppose these could be drones, used by CP to scout late-night disturbances.  Was just odd to me that there were 2 flying in unison at the same time I saw that weird light in the sky.

White stationary lights caught in Chicago on a time lapse video.  ((NUFORC Note:  Lens flares??  PD));2019-11-28 06:15:00;5 minutes;White stationary lights caught in Chicago on a time lapse video My husband set up his phone for a time lapse video in the alley behind our garage as he loaded his pickup truck.  The video shows him loading, then driving away (forgot his phone was on the fence.  After he drove away, the video shows the phone shifted it’s focus up above the garage.  He then returns and begins looking for the phone.  While he is looking, two white lights appear in the sky over the garage.  Even though the phone is still on time lapse video, the lights don’t move and you can see clouds are moving over the lights.  A third light appears briefly forming a triangle.  No craft is apparent - just lights. We are married, have 3 daughters, and two dogs. We both own our own businesses and my husband runs Christmas tree lots - why he was loading his truck early morning.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

Chicago Ohare Sighting 4.20.20;2020-04-20 22:00:00;2 seconds;Chicago Ohare Sighting 4.20.20 This is second time writing. First was for Reddit.  -I have told the story SEVERAL times by voice, phone, in person. It has never once changed. I have (during C-VID 19 Lockdown in Chicago) ALMOST convinced myself i didn't see it. But i did.  I was coming home from my parents in the suburbs.  Heading to my place in Chicago where i live.  It was POURING rain the entire 40 minute drive. It suddenly stopped, still bad conditions while i approached o'hare airport. I believe there is an underpass from i90 where ohare is literally above me on the bridge… As i exit this bridge right next to o'hare… i see the.most.beautiful. Shooting star i’ve eve imagined existed. (this is the first millisecond of time broken down) I saw this bright bright light shoot out of my vision. As this millisecond comes to a close, i realize that i saw this light fly AWAY from me. I am a mechanical engineer, i know my coordinate systems extremely well. I can tell you this light traveled up, and away from me (North East Direction). The next slight millisecond of time consisted in me understanding all the sudden that this was NOT a shooting star. It was pouring rain not 5 minutes ago. I look up, the entire sky is covered with rain clouds. They are so presumptuous that they look like their 50 feet above my vehicle. This “shooting star” that i saw i realized left my plane of vision up and away and i still see where it went: a PERFECT horizontal break in the huge rain clouds. This all takes place out of the underpass of o'hare airport. After realizing this light just escaped through that cover, the next millisecond in time is butterflies in my stomach. Because the light i just saw couldn't have been a shooting star given the cloud cover. I realize that i also saw the lights TURN INTO ONE LIGHT. From the close, o'hare type location i first saw it, i saw there were in fact 3 lights and during their exit it formed to one. The butterflies progress. Another millisecond goes by and i realize the lights are longgg gone. All the sudden my focus comes back, and i see two GIANT jumbo jets flying synchronized, in same exact direction, same exact plane of height of ground that the angle of the lights flew. These planes, giant aircrafts are moving fast i’m sure. But they're moving from my dumb perception slowly as they glide from a take off out of ohare. I line these up in my geometric mind and i notice they are at the same plane the lights were, and the lights were PERFECTLY CENTERED in between these two flashing airplanes. As if the airplanes perfectly catapulted the lights. Or guided? Or Followed? Around this time i also noticed street lights separating east and west i-90 FLICKERED. Like a perfect trail in direction of that light… Also during this time it hits me of what i just saw. My next move is to call my father. He is a wise realistic man. Straight shooter but absolutely believes in UFO’s. I call him tell him the EXACT description and words i just used to explain this. The very absolute second my story comes to an obvious end. We both hear, a click click clunk and the call drops from us. I call back, thinking perhaps he was messing with me? He thought the same of me. He rushes me off the phone and goes to bed (10:15 ish Pm) He is never like that he was very skeptical.  I think i was confirmed sighting, and they used my phone call as aid in their research whatever is going on. Since this i have just today posted on another website, and all the sudden today there is our USA govt. Releasing old footage of UFOs normalizing them? So now any local stories are blocked by CNN and CBS mentioning the pentagon releasing UFO videos. Also After my sighting 4.20.20 there was a METEOR SHOWER the next day. NIce odds right? Also same week that Elon Musk is sending satteltes out. This was definetly not that hence those need rockets, and this was silent and 50^300032.00290-10 times faster than any light i’ve ever seen.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

It was moving Northwest and very fast. It did not have a trailing tail of light behind it and looked like a very fast moving drone or craft of some kind.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
Ufo travelled at high speed and disappeared in a portal?;2020-12-10 20:06:00;Two seconds;Ufo travelled at high speed and disappeared in a portal? So I was out walking my dog and I was looking at the sky because I’m in love with the universe and we’re outside for about 15 mins. We begin to walk back home headed east, the sky is clear you can see every single star. I continue to stare at the sky and I noticed what I thought was a shooting star. I instantly thought no way I’ve never seen a shooting star my whole life. The ball of light went straight and picked up an immense amount of speed it leaving behind a white tail of light as it travelled across the sky. All of a sudden the light disappeared like it went behind a curtain and the tail followed behind and disappeared into the night sky. I can only describe the visualization as it possibly opened a portal and disappeared once inside taking the tail of light with it. I’ve never seen something travel across the sky like this! It cleared 2/3 of my field of vision in what felt like two seconds.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
~50 tiny equally spaced lights moving in a single-file line formation;2021-05-22 22:15:00;~10 Min;~50 tiny equally spaced lights moving in a single-file line formation Spotted with two others from my balcony in the Edgewater neighborhood of Chicago. We live under an O’Hare flight path so planes are a common sight, but this was completely different. At about 10:15 pm CDT on May 22, 2021, we observed a single-file line of equally-spaced tiny, white, unblinking lights traveling NE. They looked like tiny individual pixels in the sky – no discernable shape other than individual dots/squares. There were probably 50 of them or so and the entire sighting lasted about 10 minutes. Another onlooker described them as moving stars. Seems plausible that it was a line of aircraft flying exceptionally high and in formation. We checked flightradar24 as it was happening but didn’t see anything besides low-flying aircraft flying west on their O’Hare approach (which were also visible).;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
Single file formation of shiny upright ovals.;2021-06-19 19:00:00;30 minutes;Single file formation of shiny upright ovals. My husband and I were laying in the grass at Palmer Square in Logan Square, Chicago IL and could see strange objects, slowly floating through the sky. They were very far away. They followed one after another about 1 or 2 minutes apart at a steady pace. We saw about 6 of them before we had to leave. All following the exact same pattern. They looked like shiny, upright ovals, with what seemed to be an orb or light around them. They were so far away that we were unable to see any other detail.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
