We saw a strange looking object up in the sky near Midway Airport;1972-03-08 18:00:00;10 minutes;We saw a strange looking object up in the sky near Midway Airport One evening around 6pm (it was dusk by then) Grandma and me was walking the dog over down on 62nd and Rutherford Ave. right over by the factories and warehouses by the railroad tracks.  We had happened to look up at the stars so that I can see if the Planet Venus was out that night?   Meanwhile, while we were stargazing, there was this odd looking airship that had neither any wings nor any propellers on it.  It was in a shape of a bottom of an ice-cream bowl. it made a low gargle-ling humming sound.  It had started to floated eastward towards by Midway Airport, and then this object had flown out west just like a shooting star.  And weâ€™ve never seen it again. My grandma said that it was a shooting star, but I saw it different, it was more of a strange object to me rather than a shooting star.  Back then, I was 12-years-old at the time back in 1972, we were living over on xxrd and Oak Park Ave. I was living with my grandmother at the time, because my mother had passed away in 1970  During that time frame my life was much different than any other ordinary child, due to my handicap disability my experiences were un-explainable.  Up til this day I often have nightmares about UFOs and that day that we've seen this strange looking thing.  ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

February 1989 Roger's Park Chicago Northside 10PM -12:15AM Very Bright Lights/Bell Shape Craft;1989-02-11 22:00:00;2 hours and 15 minutes;February 1989 Roger's Park Chicago Northside 10PM -12:15AM Very Bright Lights/Bell Shape Craft This happened in Roger's Park at 1339 W. Estes  Avenue 1/2 block from Sheridan Road while living in a second floor apartment with my husband at the time. It is near 10 PM at night and I (administrative assistant) am drying and putting away dishes telling my husband (graphic artist/muscian) that I just have the feeling someone is going to stop by our place tonight. We are getting ready to watch the 10 o'clock news and begin to unpeg the futon couch to  make it into a bed in front of our 27 floor model TV.  He comes over to my side and says, Look out the window and he takes my hand and we walk over to see what the bright light flooding the courtyard is about.  We find it very strange and I ask him, What do you think it is? He says, Do you think they are filming a movie on top of our roof? I say, It is very bright like the Kleig movie set lights...that's so silly, it's the middle of February at 10 o'clock at night and why on top of our roof?! He suggest we put our coats on and go outside to check it out.  I step outside the foyer door onto the sidewalk where I can see my shadow like daylight (not full moon light) and exclaim how bright it is that I see my shadow like in daylight! We look up toward the roof and it is just so brilliantly white bright and we can not see beyond the castle cut-out like roof edge. We decide to walk out of the courtyard where the sidewalk is to see if we see movie trucks parked on the street and we do not. We decide to walk around to the west side of our building and there is no bright light there and nothing we can see three stories up on the roof. He wonders if there is a helicopter on our roof then, though we hear nothing like a helicopter. As we are walking back toward the sidewalk and down the street toward our courtyard we both stop simultaneously noticing that something feels very different  and we bounce off of each other some strange feelings...how it's 10 o'clock at night and there is absolutely no busy traffic, no traffic sounds, no traffic at ! all on S heridan Road and we observe the light changing from green to red...we notice there are no double parked cars or pizza delivery cars, no one out walking, etc. It also seems strange that no one is looking out their windows noticing the bright light in our courtyard alone. It seems like time and space are at a standstill and we are the only two people left in the world! We decide to go back to the courtyard and try and look up toward the top of the roof again. I pull out some sunglasses I have in my coat pocket and put them on to see if I can see any better with them on. Next we remember going back inside the apartment on the second floor. Once inside our apartment I say to my husband, Do you think we should call the police? Or will the lights be gone by the time the police arrive  here and they'll just think we are nuts? He suggests we talk to our neighbors in the morning to see if any of them saw anything and to just wait and  time  to see how long the lights continue to stay on outside. We look at an electric wall clock in our dinning room/music room that reads 10:30 PM and I say we couldn't have been out there for more than 10 minutes, how can it be 10:30 already! We both look at the VCR on top of the TV and the clock reads 12:00 midnight. We both feel that something is wrong with the time. We notice the lights are gone by 12:15 AM according to the VCR clock and the clock in the other room is stopped and stuck at 10:30 PM...it never works again.  We feel very exhausted and confused and go to bed. By morning time, we notice the VCR clock is correct in correlation with the morning tv programs. Now we both realize we could not possibly have been outside for nearly two hours when it seemed less than 10 minutes! None of our neighbors had noticed any light in the courtyard night before at all. I am very alarmed and I call my mother (LPN nurse) in Indiana saying I have something strange to tell her and she says she has something very strange to tell me about how she woke up in the middle of the night wit! h three short dark beings by her bedside all 3 wearing large different hats. She finds herself paralyzed and in terror, she closes her eyes and opens them again and they are still there. She is unable to wake my father (retired pipefitter) up. She wants to move and run and can't, she wants to scream and can't. She is reciting all the bible verses she can recall to her mind hoping  this will make them go away because she thinks they are evil and they are still there...she says she was not dreaming and they were very real to her and eventually they did go away. She is a very skeptical/logical person and is unwilling to talk of or speak of this bizarre thing to anyone else. She was very frightened and terrorfied by the experience and wonders if I could possibly have anything to do with it? I tell her the story about the lights. Over the course of a year, my husband is contiunally physcially ill and I go to the doctor with him to explain he is being mis-diagnosed and they need to find out what is the matter with him with the same symptoms I have been noticing. Seems he could have what is known as yuppie flu as he is a 60 hour a week work-a-holic...chronic fatigue syndrome...it is very controversial in the late 1980tys and his doctor decides to become more specialized and find out as much as he can to help him. By the 1990tys my husband's insurance company wants to know which he has - chronic fatigue syndrome or epstein barr virus...there is tilt-table test at St. Joseph's Hospital in Chicago and it is determined he has both in high numbers which qualifies him for disability pay, later he develops hypo-thyroid condition and fibromyalgia. He gradually recalls feeling back to the experience that he may have been ruffed up by some men  It saddens me to see him ill and I decide because I am the healthier one that I will undergo some hypnotherapy sessions to try and recall that missing time. During the sessions it is like I am re-living the experience. When I put on my sunglasses to look up on the roof toward the br! ight lig ht to see better...under hypnosis recall I find myself suddenly level with the roof top in the air and I am looking at a round bell-shaped craft with windows and an open door with pale light inside...there is brilliant bright light outside and a blue flashing light outside...it is attractive and over-whelming feelings of fun-ride over here, like excitement at an amusement park and next it is urgent, like an emergency...hospital emergency room rush over here.!I have not made it past this part in my hypnosis experience, so it's suggested that my mind/unconscious is blocking me not allowing me to see it all because I could not handle it...also I have heard of some kind of hypnosis gift or technique called rapid induction where a few dozen hypnotherapists in the U.S. are able to take their clients under very deeply, fully, walk them thru whole traumatic experience without them coming out of sesssion and able to give counsel at the end of session (such as in kidnapping/rape cases). I have not met any hypnotherapists who do such. I have come out of my sesssions feeling post traumatic stress disorder, so I had decided to stop altogether. This experience in Chicago I would say has been very life altering. ((NUFORC Note:  One of six, seemingly credible, reports submitted by same witness.  Date of event is approximate.

In the northeast quadrant we saw a bright white object tht caught our eye because it was moving very quickly.  it moved  from the east to the west and stopped on a dime it looked to be enormous and might have been seen from quite a distance .  We pulled the car over and got out to view it better. The object while it was stopped hanged from the bright white light  we originally saw changed to a bluish hue.  The cows in the field on the side of the road seemed to become nervous and started walking around. The object then darted off at a 90 degree angle and went straight up until it vanished. ;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

Craft wobbled and satellites headed south as what looked like another set of satellites (possibly back-ups?) flew past.  I saw a flash and heard a slight explosion in the distance. The craft was dark, with no lights.  It appeared to be very large and high in the atmosphere.  The craft was traveling approximately 100 miles an hour.  The satellites (or chase planes) seemed like stars, until they started to move toward the craft.  Being near an airport, I noticed there was no air traffic at the time.  I lost sight of the craft in the horizon but followed the chase planes for about 10 minutes (heading south).  There were four chase planes.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

I watched for a second or two and glanced back down at the paper. I looked back out the window and noticed the object was still there, however this time it slowly inploded itself. I found this very odd and continued to watch the same area of sky, no more than 30 seconds later it expanded from what seemed to be the same area of sky, it was now back to its original size and color(which seemed to be a hazzy oval shape brighter than the blue sky in the background) it then inploded itself again and came back to its original size, it did this several times and never seemd to leave my field of view(as if it too were moving) by this time I called attention to this object to the other passenger in the car, at that moment a second object appeard just to the upper left of the first, it was the same size and color, they both faded in and out, circled onanother at a high rate of speed and were gone. this went on for 10-15 minutes, giving a plane plenty of time to leave my field of view.

We were coming back in a van and it was about 11pm, most of us were sleeping but my aunt was driving. Then all at once we were driving and we were the only ones on the road which was straight and had corn fields on both sides of the road when my aunt said to everyone to look to the right side. Thats when we all saw a UFO. It was about 2 stories high and 20 feet wide....and it was a cube shap ...it was going very slow....it was glowing lightblue....but the scary thing is that once it past the road in front of us ....it took off faster then any jet i have ever seen. It had no windows, no wings, no jet powered engin, no tale like a shooting star..it had to be something from somewhere else because it was able to control its spead adn take off faster then a jet...and i seen jets in the air show so i know how fast they can take off .. I just know I was scared and every one in the van saw it......if anyone seen this I would really want to know if anyone has a video or pictures email ((e-address deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  We have amended the date above, to reflect a date seven years ago.

Curving streak of light zooming astonishly fast seen last night over Chicago, and I got it on tape!;2001-05-30 21:20:00;a moment;Curving streak of light zooming astonishly fast seen last night over Chicago, and I got it on tape! On Wednesday, May 30th, 2001, I was watching tv. When it was 9:00pm, I turned to the nightly WGN Chicago news program (courtesy of a cable channel I'm in TN). I had decided to watch it because I wanted to see if they were going to follow up on a report they'd had the night before. Some minutes into the news cast, they began to do the weather. Before I go any further, there's something I need to explain so you can understand what I'm talking about. I have a lot of time on my hands, I guess you could say, and for about the last year or so I've been taping (with a VCR) those shots I suppose most news casts have where during the weather the screen switches to some live view of the city. I've been doing this all this time in hopes of catching something strange on tape. And Wednesday night, after a year or so of waiting, it finally paid off! So, when that sort of shot came on, I was taping it. And within seconds, I was shocked to see what I'd been waiting for all this time: a bright streak of light shot across the upper middle part of the screen and went BEHIND some buildings in the background, going INCREDIBLY fast. MUCH MUCH MUCH faster than ANY jet could go! So fast that I was only able to get a good look at it when moments later I went downstairs and used the other VCR to slow the tape down to a minimum. When it wasn't on slow motion, this is what it looked like: almost identical in appearance to a common shooting star, kind of streak-ish, but it was very different in that ITS DIRECTION MADE A HUGE CURVE!!! I couldn't believe my eyes. It (or another one) would also appear again a few seconds later, this time shooting up from the lower right hand corner of the screen and zooming just as quickly to the upper left! (AGAIN, THIS/THESE WAS NOT A SHOOTING STAR!!!) Upon playing it like I said in slow motion, it was also noticed that a third streak could easily be seen (you couldn't miss it!) coming into the picture just as the camera finally went back to the newscasters. Needless to say, I HAVE THE TAPE and I'll always keep it. I don't remember the exact time, but it was around 9:20pm CST. The streaks were a bright yellowish-white in color. As for my background, I'm 18, and I'll be going to college in August.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
square bright object surrounded by faint red lights seen over chicago;2001-08-05 03:00:00;1 to 2 minutes;square bright object surrounded by faint red lights seen over chicago It was about 3 in the morning, some friends and I were sitting around in my friends front yard talking and one of my friends pointed to the sky and said, What is that? We all looked to where he was pointing and I saw an object that seemed to be glowing with its own light traveling across the sky from Southeast to Northwest at a steady rate.  The object appeared to me to be squarish and a yellow orange color with very faint red spots of light surrounding it.  I heard no noise.  The object traveled in a straight line across the sky, not speeding up or slowing down.  It was a very clear night, with a nearly full moon.  We had observed several planes traveling from west to east that night, both before and after we saw this object.  They were all obviously planes, with the tell tale blinking lights and the jet noises.  This object was different.  We immediately began listing off the things it could possibly be.  Someone suggested that maybe it was a childrens balloon caught in some freak jet stream.  However, the wind wasn't blowing and the stars were clear, not shimmering like on windy nights.  I got out my camera and snapped some pictures of the object, but as of yet haven't gotten them developed. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with one of the witnesses, and we found him to be quite credible, and a very good witness.  PD));41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

So when 911 happen (the towers) the sky was very quiet for a few days (no-fly order), so on 9/13/2001, around maybe 9pm, I took my dog out in my back yard, as I do every nigh.  This night was different.  So I looked up, it was a full moon, or really close to full...anyway, there it was...a red balloon-shaped object, right in the moon's path.  It just glided and its motion was smooth.  It was an awesome sight.  My understanding is Chicago police and Evanston police saw it, too.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
Brightly lit, digital-moving flying fish-shaped object with a crest of white-yellow fire emitting from its tail.;2001-10-14 03:30:00;15 mins;Brightly lit, digital-moving flying fish-shaped object with a crest of white-yellow fire emitting from its tail. A friend and I were coming back from a coffee shop (late night midterm study session) and decided to walk along Lake Michigan to get back to our dorms, which were also on the lake.  We were commenting on the low cloud cover and how strange it seemed, and were joking about it being Friday the 13th (though technically the 14th as it was after midnight).  We heard a weird whirring digital sound, followed by the sight of an aircraft free-falling directly towards the lake.   My friend immediately perceived it to be a crashing airplane and instinctually climbing the rocks to dive down into the water (certified lifeguards do these sorts of things without thinking--I, on the other hand, just stood there like a dum-dum). JUST AS IT WAS LITERALLY A FOOT AWAY FROM SPLASHING DOWN into the water, it recovered itself and swooped RIGHT over us....it was NOT a plane.  It was most certainly a UFO.  Its swooping motion was SO smooth, that it looked as though it were not at all recovering from a near-crash, but rather, it was as graceful and digital as possible.  The sound could be be described as a digital piano chord, very pleasing, soothing and attractive. Its shape can best be likened to a fish (picture a generic fish, like a goldfish) with its upper fin and back fin comprised of a yellowish-white glowing fire, which seemed to be propelling it much in the same manner that a fish's fins would.  The body of the craft was totally visible to me, mostly because the craft was SO SO SO well lit, that it's lights drowned out the shape.  I did, however, get a really good look at the underbelly of the craft, which was an amorphous huge contact-lense shape, and violet in color.  It was quasi-transparent, and if I had logic under my belt at that point, i would have made an effort to peer into the bottom, when it flew RIGHT over me.   Instead, I just started crying, both because I knew that what I was seeing was something to totally behold, and because I was instinctually scared, though it didn't have an ominous vibe at all.   After recovering from its seeming near-crash by swooping over us, it proceeded to head South--towards downtown, precisely following the scape of the lakefront.  For instance, if there was a part of the beach which jutted out, its flight-path would follow. From my awesome college campus, we could see the Eastern-edge of the downtown skyline, and we sight-followed it almost all the way there, and then lost track.  My friend ran to his dorm to grab the phone, and we began calling 911, 411, 0--all circuits busy.  When we finally got through, the lady scoffed at us and hung up. We went to stand out where we originally saw it crash through the clouds, thinking that was it, and then, at the same time, we both saw it--AGAIN!!  It was coming back down North, again following the beachscape.  I thought it was coming towards us, so we began running away, as silly as that may sound.   While I was running, I was still looking back at it, and saw it come to the point where it had crashed through and then move VERTICALLY, very quickly and disappear above the very low cloudline almost exactly where it came through.  In addition to the fishlike shape with the fire-crest propulsion system (at least that is how I perceived it), here is more detail: The front of the craft had an upside-down U shaped lime-green, sequentially flashing (like chaser Christmas lights) nose, and the body had a number of sporadically placed lights that were hot pink, red, deeper purple...it was like a flying night-club, and obviously not meant to be inconspicuous, which really threw me off.  This sounds like a description of someone on acid, I know, but I need to ITERATE that my friend and I had just come back from a coffee shop, where we were studying.  No alcohol or otherwise was at all involved.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

I can only describe its shape as akin to a baby pacifier.  It moved quickly, but with a simaltaneous rocking motion, that seemed very measured and constant.  It moved so quickly, about the distance of three quarters of a mile, at about a minute's passing.  I might add that even though i'm in Chicago, it was a particularly still day today.  Very strange, for some reason, seems noteworthy;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

As I got closer I noticed that the balloon was glowing and orange in color.  It seemed to be getting closer but moving away at the same time.  It began to take the shape of an orange slice (like the fruit).  As I sped up to get a closer look, the object started to move away faster than any other flying craft that I've every seen.  It became so small in such a quick amount of time, it practically disappeared as it moved away further south.  I caught back up to it around 1st ave. and the object was back to its original size.  Everyone around me was looking through their front windshield trying to figure out what the heck this thing was.  It was moving too quickly for me to get truely anywhere near it and I had to exit off the highway.  That's when I lost sight of the object.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

Quite large boomerang shaped object with dim/ faint yellowish lights lining the V-shape of the bottom;2006-11-19 19:30:00;6-10 seconds?;Talking on phone on deck and looked east towards direction of Lake Michigan.   Noticed planes doing flight patterns for Ohare as always at night.   However, between observing planes I noticed a quite large boomerang shaped object with dim/ faint yellowish lights lining the V-shape of the bottom.   Strangely, could only make out the shape against the partly cloudly and starry sky.  The object seemed to blend in well with the night sky as if camouflaged mostly--it moved very slowly southward.  Could not hear any sounds from it either.     As I am about 2.5+ miles from the lake, I am guessing it was somewhere between my location and the lake.  Maybe closest to Wrigley Field area--and headed south.   The object faded out of view and the dim lights went with it.  **Wondered if it was a stealth-type fighter but read other accounts and decided to report this.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
Object sighted after reviewing video taken from aircraft preparing to land;2007-05-12 14:00:00;2 minutes;Object sighted after reviewing video taken from aircraft preparing to land Student pilot flying Diamond DA40 on down wind leg to land runway 11 at Waukeegan Airport just NW of Chicago.  I, nor the two passengers in the aircraftm noticed the object.  I noticed it will editing the video recorded by the rear passenger.  Aircraft was pointing West at an altitude of 1700 ft, airspeed 90kts.  Aircraft is equipped with a Traffic Collision Avoidance System - and it did not report any aircraft at the time of filming, plus, there were no ofther aircraft reporting in the area the time the video was taken.  When I noticed the object in the film I first thought it was a beacon, but it moves and there are no beacons I know of in that area.  Analyzing the video, it is apparent that the object changes color from white to blue to red and back and forth.  The stills I made from the video appear to show a shape of a childs spinning top.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
ufo in fireworks display;2008-07-04 22:00:00;10-15 min;ufo in fireworks display I was visiting my son and his wife in Chicago over the 4th of July. He lives in a high rise apartment building over 40 stories tall near Lake Michigan. We went to the roof to have a panoramic view of the fireworks around the city.  There were a great number of fireworks particularly in the out-lying areas of the city. Even with the city lights the fireworks were phenonmenal. At one point I noticed an area of intense firework activity. I only focused on it for a few seconds then scanned other areas. When I returned my gaze to this spot I noticed some of the lights seemed to be hanging in one spot for an unusually long period. How do they make them do that, I asked myself. Then I pointed it out to my son.  Again I was distracted. When I glanced back the lights were still hanging there. They seemed to form a hat-shape with red and green lights which shimmered around the form. UFO popped into my mind but I discounted it.  I was once more distracted. When I looked back again at this hat-shaped object six very bright golden orbs seemed to emanate from it and hang momentarily around it.  My mind seemed to be affected by what I saw. I certainly felt spaced out. (I don't drink or do mind-altering substances stronger than coffee.) When I looked again for the object, it had disappeared along with the orbs.  It wasn't until the next day that I realized that I'd seen a UFO. I'm over 60 years old and this is the first one I've ever seen one though I do believe we are visited, if not influenced, by aliens. I broached the subject of the sighting with my son & daughter-in-law. He's an engineer and she's an accountant. He brushed off the UFO hypothesis. She said nothing except she hadn't noticed anything.  I feel the need to communicate this with someone, hence this letter.  Peace to all...;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

Flaming dot in the night sky;2009-06-17 23:00:00;2 minutes;Flaming dot in the night sky My boyfriend and I were sitting on our back porch. As we were sitting down, we immediately noticed a bright orange twinkling dot in the sky. At first impression, we both agreed that it looked like a flaming airplane! It was traveling northwest in the sky at a good clip and we continued thinking that it was some sort of airplane...on flames possibly. Very abruptly however, it just stopped. It continued to hover and twinkle for aprox. 40 seconds. At one point towards the end of the 40 seconds, I waved and said HI! at the top of my lungs. Immediately after that, it started to fade slightly, at which point I noticed a very faint triangle coming from the flaming dot (the dot being at the very top of the triangle). As soon as I noticed this, it gracefully faded into nothingness. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
Saw a strange, fast flying object with NO lights heading Northbound LOW in the sky over Chicago.;2010-03-18 01:15:00;30 seconds;Saw a strange, fast flying object with NO lights heading Northbound LOW in the sky over Chicago. At approx. 1:15 a.m. on Thursday March 18th 2010 - I was letting my dog out in the backyard and was staring up at a clear nights sky.  The Big Dipper was right above the yard and I was admiring the stars.  An object suddenly came into view overhead.  It was flying a little higher than a helicopter typically flies around my neighborhood.  However, there was no sound - there were no lights - and it had a reddish tint to it.  It just quickly floated off to the North.  I did seem to hear a small rumble after it had passed out of sight.  It almost seemed like it didn't hold form... yet it was in sort of a cigar shaped formation.  I have always had interest in UFO's and whatnot.  You always hear of flying saucers actually being weather balloons.  Well, this could have been just that... it did sort of look like a really big deflated balloon flying very quickly.  I don't know what it was.  All I know is that it made the hair on my neck stand up!;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
A sentient animal that looked human, with no eyes but a mouth with flatter lips stood at the foot of my bed.  ((anonymous report));2010-06-15 03:00:00;contact;a sentient animal that looked human, with no eyes but a mouth with flatter lips stood at the foot of my bed as I awoke. I opened my eyes, in the old master bedroom of the house with the addition.  It was the first bedroom up the stairs.  At first I was looking up, but saw something black by the foot of the bed but off the left, actually on the side of the bed of me, and not actually at the foot, but sort of a little closer than the foot.  I looked at it.  It looked almost exactly human, and I assumed my family was playing some type of prank of me with a black suit and mask, probably my brother.  This creature was actually quite tall, taller than a normal human.  But the mouth was flesh and had no lips but sort of a creased structure.  The eyes, I thought were covered, but this creature didn't have eyes.  It was just a head with a mouth and it stood, analyzing me through it's head.  This must have been the way it sensed things.  I looked at the clothes, still thinking this was a costume of my father or brother's to scare me.  The animal had a black suit.  I looked at the detail of the ski! n, and saw that it was essentially faceless, but with a bald head.  A man wearing black, but without eyes and a flatter face.  I exited the home within 15 seconds.  My bed was close to the door, which was open.  And the front door was right down the colonial stairs.  My parents put about 1,000,000 into that house, the museum house I called it.  They were once offered 2,000,000 for the colonial home with a large back addition and a fourth floor.  Maybe whatever decided to stop saw the largely lit building that didn't look like a normal house.  On the 4th floor, there was a typical colonial roof that was extended with the addition and about 6 sky-lights.  They were usually brightly lit from the internal lights, like patterns to the sky.  When we built the addition, we also found this energy piping leading to nowhere in the open land behind us.  The builders said there was something they couldn't comprehend about it exactly, and we decided to bury/ignore it.  I sometimes wonder if we had ! followed it, was it just a bunker from a War that the original! house owners had built?  Why was there power and metal lines running to a field from a house that was over a hundred years old..  I ran outside the home that day, partially naked, screaming the whole way.  There are other details such as seeing a female, and also skin markings but I don't want to go into these because they'll sound like I'm fabricating.  This experience was really just contact. I meditate and try to connect with the peace in the universe.  I'm not really sure if these other sentient beings can feel energy from people, but it seemed like it was observing me from the side of my bed. Hopefully a nice, enlightened creature, not something menacing.  I didn't ever see that man, as I think of him, again.  And I looked up japanese lore, and it said noppera-bo, a vision of someone about to betray you.  Or perhaps a visitor with an alternate transportation device that we don't comprehend.  I think that this being, was sensing and probably used the natural universe on a different level that me, because without eyes, there must have been some other type of sense that kept him almost at a respectable distance from my bed.  If he was any closer, I would not have gone off that same side of the bed.  I'd probably have rolled around the other side and gone out the balcony screaming.. I'm not sure.  But both of us were close to the door, and I am happy I got away. Maybe the screaming let him know I was uncomfortable..  I feel like he let me leave.  I feel like I could have been stopped since the stairs were quite steep.  I went from the top landing, right outside by bed and where I dropped my feet, down the stairs, and outside.  I recall feeling safe, inside my chest and body once I got to the street and looked back at the house, not seeing anyone and seeing cars/ I believe at least one person.  I don't actually remember what happened after the street.  I think I got in contact with my family somehow, I don't recall this was in about 2010, but as early as 2008.  This creature, was not human. Afternote: I wrote about some markings! on my skin, but deleted them because that evidence, I thought, would discredit this account. I have been getting these unexplained white dots on my skin, like a scoop removed and then this white transluscent almost skin grows over.. healing kinda fast and appearing out of nowhere.  The two dots were on my abdomen, then my leg, and there have been others that appear elsewhere, like my forearm.  These are more recent, and I'm sometimes wondering if the contact was peaceful, or if I don't know what's happening when I'm sleeping/being accosted.

The sound vibrated throughout the house flying northwest towards Midway airport.  We then ran to the back window to see what it does, the craft at first looked like it would be around the same form as a helicopter, it then flew in a few figure eight formations over Midway ( possibly Midway) airport.  Because of the craft it looked as if a plan trying to land had to divert around it.  It then proceeded to fly over Cicero Ave headed south, we were able to see the craft that we thought was a helicopter come towards us it had one white spotlight and one red light following directly behind it was 3 fin lights (horizontal) flashing in like a ripple line.

V shaped craft.;2012-09-01 19:00:00;5-10 minutes;V shaped craft The sighting that I am reporting happened around a year ago. I have thought about it frequently since it happened.  It occurred on a summer day in the evening. I was sitting on my balcony watching the sunset in western skies.  Something dark in the sky caught my attention. What I observed was a v-shaped craft slowly heading east.  It was about the size of a regular commercial airplane.  It wasn't very high at all and I was able to see it clearly. as it passed over my apartment I rushed inside to grab my binoculars and headed to my back balcony.  As I looked thru the binoculars the first thing I noticed was that a dark blue light traveled on the sides of the craft. Then I noticed that it had a slow spin to it.  Which now when I reflect I find very strange.  You would think the craft being v shaped would fly with the nose pointing to the direction it's heading.  This was not the case making it not normal flight.  This craft was hovering and rotating slowly traveling from west to east.  One final detail is that this thing made absolutely no noise at all.  Being that low in altitude it should have made engine noise. I watched it heading north east until i lost sight of it.   live very close to ohare airport and see many planes at low altitudes.  This was not a plane nor a helicopter.  This craft was truly unidentified. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
Unidentified object observed during daylight by crew of Lake Michigan sailboat.;2013-07-01 14:00:00;10 seconds;Unidentified object observed during daylight by crew of Lake Michigan sailboat. Sailing due South 4 miles East of Navy Pier area. 15mph West-East wind, clear, unlimited visibility, 2-3 foot waves, 85 degrees.  Aboard a 32 foot Beneteau 321 with full roller furling main sail and genoa out, sails over the port side of the boat filled with wind on a broad reach, sailing at approx 4.5 knots 2 crewman aboard in the cockpit.  Dead ahead, at an indeterminate altitude, at an indeterminate distance both crew saw what appeared to be a silhouette of an aircraft traversing due West to East across the bow of the boat.  The object appeared roughly in the shape of a Cessna 172 or a Blackhawk helicopter.  No sound was heard.  The object was moving in a generally downward angle and disappeared from view as it passed across the center line of the boat and became obscured by the full Genoa sail.  The helm was put hard over to starboard and the boat slid into near irons as both crew searched the sky and water for the object.  Nothing was seen in the air in the general vicinity of where the object's path should have taken it or in the water had it continued downward.   Both witnesses agreed that what they had seen looked remarkedly like the outline of a small aircraft but without any distinguishing features.  It appeared to be a uniform dull light brown or khaki color.  If it was a small aircraft then by its size not only should the witness have been able to see distinguishing features but its N number should have been observable.  The crew conducted a brief search for debris using unaided eye sight and binoculars and considered issuing a Mayday to local marine law enforcement but decided not to since they could not definitively state that they had witnessed an aircraft or that if it was, that it was in distress.   Guessing, based upon the total impressions and information at the time, it was speculated that what had been seen was some form of craft that was using some form of technology that interfered with visual observatio! n.  Some sort of technology that reduced the observable contra! st of it s surfaces that would normally be apparent under unaltered observation.  Also, there was no form of exhaust or contrail or light associated with the object.  It looked like a dull brownish blob on a trajectory, no sound, or other distinguishing feature with a kind of trailing tail structure attached to what would be like a cockpit area on a Cessna 172.

Dark gray flat-ended saucer shaped object flying west to east.;2013-07-04 20:48:00;3 minutes;Dark gray flat-ended saucer shaped object flying west to east. On the Fourth of July, I was on my second floor deck, watching the fireworks begin, looking W/NW.  The sun had set, but there was still an orange glow to the western clouds.  Far to the west, I saw a dark gray object hovering just under the cloud line.   I stepped inside to retrieve a pair of binoculars that I keep hanging inside the door.  I sighted the object through the binoculars, and it was moving east at a slow pace, coming right towards me.  It was very far away, so it is difficult to estimate its size, but I would say it was just a little smaller than a mid-sized plane.   It was silent, had no running lights, and no exhaust.  As it came closer, perhaps a mile or two away, it started to bank to it's left, or North.   As it banked, I could clearly see that it was saucer shaped in front, but the back end was flat what a dime would look like if one clipped off about an eighth of it.  I followed it with the binoculars until it disappeared past the tree line.

Bow-tie like ship with blueish light in middle flying counter clockwise almost out of control.;2014-06-14 19:00:00;7 minutes;Bow tie like ship with blueish light in middle flying counter clockwise almost out of control. Out with my sister having our yard sale when she says, Is that a bird?  As I looked at the object I first thought it was a bag that had flown up with the wind.   As the object got closer towards us we noticed that it was a ship of some sort.  It appeared to look similar to a bow tie like shape.   It moved in an unconventional pattern almost counter clockwise.  Seemed as if the pilot had lost all control of the ship.   I know that it definitely was a ship due to the one light that would flicker when the craft turned in our direction.   The light seemed almost blueish and was in the middle of the craft.   The object appeared to go higher and higher and we stared until it was out of distance and way up in the sky.  As the object passed our area I began to record with my iPhone but only seen a dot when I looked back at the video.   Thought it was weird so I decided to google and came across this site so hope someone else noticed.  Just seemed very out of the ordinary.

Large craft, triangular in the front/middle section, wide across with an arrowhead/chevron look, fading in/out of sky, lights on bottom;2015-06-06 22:15:00;3-4 minutes;Large craft, triangular in the front/middle section, wide across with an arrowhead/chevron look, fading in/out of sky, lights on bottom On the evening of June 6, 2015, around 10:15, I was letting my dog out into the yard and looked toward the sky while I waited for her.   I was standing and looking directly eastward and about a quarter of a mile away and (from my perception) about 20-40 feet above a treeline, I saw an extremely large shape in the sky, very sharply pointed in the middle, which I saw first, and extremely wide and long in its width, which all of a sudden just seemed to slowly appear.  It almost reminded me of a large bulky arrowhead in the width, but the sharply pointed center looked like the two sides of a triangle. In the middle of it, above the largely pointed center, was a round shape that looked almost dome-like or conical.  I could not see the length of it as I was looking directly at it as it was heading west, and just could see the front and width of it.  Perhaps the craft was just super wide and not long in length at all, which is possibly why I did not see its length.  It was moving slowly, not fast at all.  The middle portion (triangle dome-like center) looked a bit lighter than the rest of the craft.   As I continued to stare at it â€“ pretty much frozen and afraid to blink - I then saw what looked like a hot sidewalk effect, for lack of a better description, or a waviness slowly forming around this thing, and then it looked as though piece by piece I could see through it until it faded or melted into the sky, almost as though it was camouflaging itself in the night sky.  If I hadnâ€™t been looking in that exact direction at the moment I did, I would have missed it, despite it being so large, because of the way it sort of fit in with the sky.   As it got a little closer, I noticed light from underneath it but then I also noticed that it faded into the sky more and the shape became sort of lost or not as discernible as it had been.  What did become more discernible, though, were the lights.  By the time it was nearing my home, I saw one larg! e circle with about 15-20 red globes of light within the circle.  I sensed that the lights were underneath something, but the object was not discernible around or over the lights at this point.  Everything looked just really dark.  But I knew it was there and I sensed it was there.  The lights seemed low, perhaps 500-600 feet.  It was silent.  The circle of lights then moved very slightly in a northwesternly direction over my house.   At this point, I became afraid and grabbed my dog.  I ran from the back door through my house to the front window as it faces north, to see if I could follow it, but when I looked at my front window it had disappeared.  It was just gone.  I did not go back outside. It is difficult to judge by measurement the size of what I saw without using the words huge or large.  If I stand in the same spot where I was standing when I initially saw it above the treeline about a quarter of a mile away and hold up a quarter at armâ€™s length, then I would have to hold perhaps 3-4 quarters across to cover the width of it at that distance when I saw it first appear in the sky. I live fairly close to an airport (about 30 minutes south) and am very familiar with the sights and sounds of airplanes, whether they are flying high or low, daytime or nighttime, but this was not like anything I had ever seen before.  It didnâ€™t make one sound, and was large.  There are always planes flying in their flight paths over my neighborhood, but strangely enough, there wasnâ€™t one plane in sight during that time or that I could hear.  Just silence. My husband and son werenâ€™t home at the time, and I did not have my cell phone on me when this occurred as I was just letting the dog out and had left it in the house, never thinking this would be happening, so unfortunately, I can only tell you what I saw with my own eyes. After telling my husband and son about my experience, they showed me pictures of a stealth bomber, but it did not resemble what I saw.  They also showed me pictures of Chinese lanterns, but again, the lights that I saw did not resemble Chinese lanterns. This was such an unnerving experience for me.  I wish there was some sort of explanation.  I can only hope that someone else will report seeing something similar on that night  â€“ it certainly would make me feel a lot better.  And I can tell you without hesitation that this was most definitely not a plane. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
