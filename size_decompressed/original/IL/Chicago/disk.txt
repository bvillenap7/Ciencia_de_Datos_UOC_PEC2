Silver metallic disc observed at Roseland little league baseball field.;1982-06-19 15:00:00;45 seconds;Silver metallic disc observed at Roseland little league baseball field. On a clear summer day on the southside of Chicago, I was at Roseland little league baseball field with a group of other juveniles. Someone in our group said to look up. I looked up and saw a silver metallic disc in the southwest sky of our location. This object was zigzagging at such a fast rate. It was such an abnormal flight pattern. My first thought was that it was possibly a kite. So I looked down to see if anyone had a string below. After not seeing anyone below, I looked up again and continued to see this object zigzag. The best way I can think of describing what I saw is to compare it to someone holding a mirror or metal object, and then reflecting the sun off of it. The event lasted about 45 seconds. The metallic disc then just took off up and out of sight. There were no lights on it no bulb no haze or any other crafts with it.  I went home and expected to see something on the news about it. No such luck. Being that I was a juvenile at the time, I didn't really give it too much thought. I figured there had to be a rational explanation to what we had all seen. Then I figured, it couldn't be from outer space because UFO'S were always depicted to hover, have lights and land. Not be visible in Chicago of all places. This recent report of the sighting at O'Hare has compelled me to tell my story.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

The Saucer Tried To Land On Our Snow-Covered Field As We Crossed To Reach Our School.;1989-12-23 08:00:00;5;The Saucer Tried To Land On Our Snow-Covered Field As We Crossed To Reach Our School. It was really scary, and I have tried to forget about it, but I have not been able to. I was only 10 years old at the time. I am 22 now, and have waied a long time to share my story. One darkish Winter morning, my mother and my father were walking my sister and I to school. Our school was fairly close to our old apartment building in Chicago on the Westside. To get to our school, you have to walk across a huge empty field. This field was covered with snow. Anyway, we were coming across the field,  a few other people were ahead of us. Then it happened. There was a SUPER loud crashing sound. Louder than anything I've ever heard. Later, I found out that this noise was heard all across Chicago, and some close cities. So you know it was LOUD! Then I saw a white round object that looked hard, hovering over the field. About as high as your average house. It was low enough to scare everybody on the field. There was a bright strip of light, coming from one side of the Saucer. There was a crazy beeping sound, and everybody on the field hit the ground. We covered our heads in the cold snow. We were scared. When we got back up, the object was gone, and the sky had gone back to being dark. Everybody was shaken up. Laughing about what we had just seen. We didn't know what to do, this was 1989. There was only 1 white spaceship. It never landed. But I believe that it was trying to land on our snow-covered field. But when they saw humans, they scared us, and left. I am now 22. I'm black. I'm in college. My father is now dead of a heart attack, he would be 44 in October. My mother is 44. She works at a hospital. She's the sweetest lady. My sister is 26. She graduated with a degree in pschology from a 4-year university. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We will request other reports from the other witnesses.  We have received reports for other dates that are somewhat similar to this one, namely, from Traverse City, MI, and from northern California.

I tried to post this yesterday but could not get to the site so I wrote it all down on a wp so i would not get anything wrong;1999-01-23 04:00:00;approx 15 min;I tried to post this yesterday but could not get to the site so I wrote it all down on a wp so i would not get anything wrong I saw something very strange last night 1/23/99. I work midnight’s and This was my normal day off, I usually try to stay up most of the nights I’m off since its easier on the body. I was listening to Art Bells show when the dogs started to act funny, this was about 4am central. I thought they wanted to go out so I headed to the back door. I live a couple of miles from a midsized city an hour south of Chicago on I-57.. Our subdivision is built in a large U shape with a farm field in the center. The houses opposite mine are about three hundred yards away across the field to the east. The filed is about six or seven hundred yards north south. We have had a very dense fog for the last few days due to little wind, a very deep snow cover and temperatures in the mid to upper 40’s. The Fog has been so thick that I could not see the houses across the field behind me, visibility has probably been 100 yards or less. As I approached the back door to let the dogs out I saw a green light coming from the back yard, actually from the field behind the yard. This puzzled me since the fog was still out side. I could see it out of the window in the front of the house from the room where my computer is located.  I grabbed a flashlight that was on a table and headed out. What I saw amazed me. I opened the door and there it was. A large object probably 40 or 50 feet off the ground. The center of the object, which had a small intense green light on the bottom was located about 75 or 80 yards directly behind my yard in a line with a point 5 feet to the north of my back door connecting the electrical box at the edge of the property. It was about 100 feet in diameter since it looked like it would touch the ground if it were turned 90 degrees and extend about the same distance upward from its midpoint. It looked cigar shaped but had point like extensions kind of like a star of David but eight of them equidistant around the circumference. I poked my head back into the house to look for a camera, my wife took up scrapbooking a few months ago and usually has a camera with film in it in the kitchen. I found the camera, but no film. I was going to grab the video camera but it was in a different room. What I did see to grab was my laser pointer from my brief case on the island in the kitchen. I kept the dogs inside and headed out to see this thing with my maglight and my laser pointer in hand. I only had a pair of slippers on but didn’t think much of it till later. I shined he flashlight at the object but the fog made it a big blur for lack for a better word. I left it on the deck as I headed out to the edge of the yard.. When I reached the edge of the yard and the end of the grass I stopped. I was still 70 or so yards away from the edge of it. It did not move. I shinned the pointer at the object then and could see my beam and the point it hit the objects belly. I then shinned it on the neighbors house to get some idea how far it would go and still be visible in the fog I could see it as far as 2 houses away but could not see where I knew the third house to be. So the visibility limit for the point was probably somewhere between 100 and 150 yards or so. I then shined the pointer on the object running it across the bottom  making sure to run it along all the edges to better judge its size. After a few minutes of this the light on the bottom of the object flashed once. It increased by at least, I’m guessing 3 orders of magnitude. Then it went back to its previous brightness the flash lasted maybe ¼ second and reminded me of a photo flash but green in color. After a  few seconds it flashed again but twice this time, each flash about ½ second apart. It did it again a few seconds later and this time it did three flashes then a few seconds without a flash then 5 flashes a period of  seconds then 7 flashes. It was then it dawned on me these were prime numbers. I still had the pointer and I shined 11 flashes at the green light then 13. The object then flashed 17 at me. We were communicating.  Then it stopped for almost a minute. At this point its easier to just write in the number sequence of flashes I have no idea what they mean. 19,7,8,18,19,6,16,19,21,11,21,12,13,20,23,21,24,8 	After the last grouping the light went dull maybe a magnitude or so dimmer than it was initially. Then at the tips of the star like projections green lights but a darker green or a little toward blue came on. The object started to lift up then moving a few feet a second at first then moving faster. There was no sound. It looked to be going straight up.  I shined the pointer on it until I could not see the point any longer but could still make out the 8 lights from the projections for a few more seconds then it was just gone. 	The whole event took maybe 10 or 12 minutes, I forgot to look at the watch when I went outside but know that it was around 4 am, it was just after 4 15 when I checked the watch. Then I went out to the field to the point that was under the center of the object. The snow in the field was kind of spotty but a circular pattern could be seen at the point I figured to be under the green light. The pattern was by stepping it off in my house slippers 45 paces a bit bigger I think than what I had thought the object was. My step count was 115 from my army days, this put the diameter of the circle on the ground at about 127 feet. 	I saw your site on Arts site so I figured you would like to know about this. I would rather not attach my name as I think people may find out about this and think im crazy. But I will give directions to the location without giving my actual address as well as my email, though im not sure thats a good idea. On I 57 take the 1st exit to kankakee southbound from chicago. Note sure of the exit number but there is a Wal-Mart near it along with a mall. Head south 1/2 mile to an intersection there will be a Dennys on the right and the Wal-Mart will be on the Left front. Turn left at this intersection. You will be headed East. The road crosses over I 57 and continues east. From the center of the over-pass the site is 1 mile further East just past the first creek that you will come to. From here you can't miss it.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
In the Summer of 99 in Chicago I witnessed a UFO up close;1999-07-01 09:00:00;15 minutes;In the Summer of 99 in Chicago I witnessed a UFO up close My sister, friend and I were on my back patio which was on the top floor of the apartment complex located on Beacon and Lawerence Ave when we noticed a bright chrome flying craft In a far distance which seemed to be hovering above the lake and I we were baffled trying to figure out what it could be because we knew it wasn't any aircraft we've witnessed before but as kids we ignored it after 5 minutes because it just stayed there hoovering.  My sister and friend were horsing around but I stayed put by the railing looking at them all of a sudden something made me look up I can't remember what it was but when I did these bright intense lights that I can look directly into without blinking floaters or watering of the eyes was right above me approximately 6 ft and I could see the craft it was so huge that only a quarter of it was visible the rest was stretching over multiple apartment buildings and over mine as well.  It was soundless and chrome but I couldn't see a! ny doors or markings on it only the bottom.  All I remember was looking down after looking at it for about 2 to 3 mins but it seemed longer then back up and it was gone without a trace.  The odd part about not only seeing such a thing was that it was never mentioned nor thought of not even with eachother until years later so Idk whether or not they abducted me and erased my memory.  I also have a lump/ ball in my right upper arm that's never been checked. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Slow moving, then rapid moving to out of view disc shapes object in night sky;1999-07-26 22:00:00;30 seconds;Slow moving, then rapid moving to out of view disc shapes object in night sky My friend and I were sitting in my car talking about things.  I was looking out of the drivers side window as my friend kept talking.  I was looking out west.  Midway airport was just south east of us, so planes come in to land.  There was a tree a couple of blocks down and I thought it was just a black plastic garbage back attached to the tree blowing in the wind or something.  It was a black shiny object.  It started to drift away from the tree (to the left) very slowly.  That's when I noticed it was really far away, not part of the tree or a plastic bag.  It was drifting in a perfect straight line to the left looking like this shape:  \  My friend saw me staring out there, and just as he looked at it, it lit up.  The lights seems to be in a spinning motion.  The object moved down a little bit, then all of a sudden is zig-zagged VERY quickly and zoomed behind the tree out of sight.  It had to have been many miles away because it was no where near the actual tree, just out of view.  My friend and I got out of the car and were trying to come up with an explaination.  Minutes later, 5-6 aircraft went in towards the area where the object had disappeared behind the tree out of our view (I see aircraft and helicopters both FAR away and upclose since I live next to the airport!).  I had never seen anything like it and I am very skeptical of UFO sightings.  This was my first.  I was thinking that maybe it was a military test or something.  I could hardly sleep last night thinking about it.  The way the lights pulsed together making a rotation effect....and the way it was just drifting so slow and then moved VERY fast from such a great distance.  I thought I was crazy, but my friend explained it to the me same way I saw it....rotating lights....zig-zag and GONE at a high rate of speed.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

Standing on my backporch I saw a disklike object gliding slowly through the air;2003-10-20 16:45:00;1 min;Standing on my backporch I saw a disklike object gliding slowly through the air Just got off the phone with my husband, who advised me to get out of the house for some air because it's so nice outside, about 84 degrees.  This is unusual for October. I took my crocheting out on the back porch to catch some sun since I've been in the house all day.  My next door neighbor's grandson came out into their backyard.  I had just got up to go to the railing to say hi, when a balloon shape in the sky caught my eye.  It looked like a black balloon.  What made me look at it so long was that it looked too big to be so high in the sky.  It was gliding eastward, toward the lake, then it turned and I could see that it was not a balloon but somewhat flat like a disk but not completely flat...and shiny with a kind of orange/gold circular shape in the middle.  Then I thought maybe it's a frisbee or something...but it kept flipping, over and over.  It wasn't moving fast, just kind of gliding. Then I lost sight of it as it went overhead and further east.  I ran to the front windows but there are too many trees, so I couldn't see it anymore.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

Silent wobbling disk with white-illuminated underside moving southwest above downtown Chicago;2006-06-04 22:15:00;60 seconds;Silent wobbling disk with white-illuminated underside moving southwest above downtown Chicago I was standing on my west-facing balcony on an upper floor of the east tower of the Marina City condo buildings in downtown Chicago (the famous corncob-shaped buildings), speaking to a friend on the phone.  My view is to the north and west with a 22-mile horizon view, broken by the ABA (former Quaker) building to the west.  I looked absentmindedly to the northwest sky and noticed a small, silent, disk-shaped object flying steadily on a southwestern trajectory about a quarter of a mile away and about 600 feet above the ground (it was higher than my balcony and close, but moved behind the 600-foot tall ABA building while I watched it, giving me the opportunity to judge its height).  The top and sides of the disk were completely dark, but the bottom surface was illuminated completely with a brilliant white light, as if a spotlight were shining on it from below.  The disk proceeded steadily in speed, but wobbled as it went, something like a top spinning slightly off its axis, so that every couple of seconds the illuminated underside rotated or leaned into view and then rotated away, but without the craft losing any forward momentum.  (The wobble in the disk looked a lot like the wobble you see in the various news videos of the disks from the daytime mass-event in Mexico a few years ago, which is what I immediately thought of as soon as I saw the object).  After about 20 seconds the object moved behind the ABA building and I waited for about 30 seconds for it to reappear, which it did, much further away due to its southwest trajectory and still moving at the same speed and height.  After another ten seconds it disappeared from view completely behind Marina City's west tower.  I was speechless throughout the incident, prompting my friend on the phone to ask what was wrong.  I explained everything I saw and spent several hours watching the skies from my apartment that night, but the object or another like it did not reappear.  From my apartment, I see hundreds of planes flying to and from O'Hare and flying along the flight path to Midway, as well as helicopters (traffic, police, etc.) all the time, every day and night.  I'm very familiar with the airport flight paths and aircraft lighting schemes, as they're part of my nonstop view out of my windows and off of my balcony.  What I saw last night was like absolutely nothing I have ever seen flying over Chicago.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
Several UFO sightings in Chicago, IL during a four hour time span.;2007-03-05 18:00:00;4 hr 30 min;Several UFO sightings in Chicago, IL during a four hour time span I live in Chicago, IL and I believe that I saw several UFO's yesterday. I was running late for work and I wasn’t paying much attention to the sky as I headed to an elevated train station.  But I had just missed my train as I was climbing the stairs to the platform, at around 5:52 p.m., I knew I was definitely going to be late, because I had to be at work at 6, so I decided to relax since I was going to be late anyway.   I walked to the middle of the platform, which is my favorite spot because there’s an open lot behind the station and a clear view of the sky.  I listened to my MP3 player for a few minutes and for some reason I decided to turn east and face that open parking lot, this was probably at 5:56 p.m. When I did I noticed a round brightly lit ball just sitting in the sky.  The lights didn’t blink.  So at first I thought it was a plane, because I wasn’t expecting to see something different than that.  I soon realized that it definitely wasn’t a plane because it was dark outside.  Although planes have lights that are visible at night their frames aren't.  Planes also always move while they’re mid-air, and they’ll appear larger or smaller eventually depending on which direction they are heading.  This object seemed to be a ball that was illuminated all over, it didn’t move, and it appeared the same size the whole time I looked at it.  Then as I looked further past it, eastward, I saw two other objects that were identical to the first one.  They all were in a perfectly straight line with one another, the line made a diagonal from where I was standing.  These objects didn't move either.  I know they had to be miles apart realistically, but from where I was standing they only seemed about 50 - 75 ft. apart from one another. Suddenly I saw the first object head westbound straight across the sky, it covered the distance pretty quickly, I’d say more quickly then the average plane would, but not astronomically so.  I didn’t hear any noise as this happened.  The other objects stayed in position and didn’t move.  About 30 seconds after seeing this, my train arrived at my platform this was at 6:02 p.m.   I sat down and looked out of the window, and kept my eyes eastward on the sky for the length of my trip.  As soon as we’d covered about 4 or 5 blocks, I noticed that there hadn’t been two other objects behind the first one that had flown off.  There had actually been 3. I saw that even though this one was the furthest away from me, it was brightly lit and looked identical to those others, and it was next in the diagonal line, and it too just sat there in the sky as well. My train headed north to the downtown section of Chicago, and even as I covered at least 30 blocks worth of distance, from the original point at which I saw the objects, they were still very visible, and very bright, until some of the high rise buildings started to block my view. I know that they weren’t moving, because as I was riding on the train and looking out at the objects, they started to appear as if they were moving with me, in the same direction I was traveling, which is how the moon, or water towers of local suburbs, used to appear to me when I was younger riding in a car. Obviously a water tower is a fixed object, and it looked like it moved with me, so I know the same has to be true of these objects. My trip to downtown took about 15 minutes, because I arrived at work at 6:17 p.m. as I said, a few minutes before, my view of the objects had been blocked, but my eyes were still on the sky in case there was a clearing. I didn’t see the objects again, but I did see another aircraft flying a few miles higher than me, but parallel to the train I was on. I only glimpsed it for a few seconds because the buildings blocked my view. It could have been just a plane, but it was so low, and I think there’s some sort of a no fly zone, in downtown Chicago, so I don’t know why a plane would fly so close in that area. This is the only object whose shape I can’t really describe, it was possibly rectangular, but I didn’t get to really look at it. I just remember it flying in between one of the high rises, and it was brightly lit, but the craft itself was dark, probably brown. I felt that it looked odd because it didn’t look like a plane, yet it was flying. It was also bulky and heavy, looking, but quickly disappeared from my view. I definitely know that it didn’t resemble a plane at all.  I eventually went to work for four hours but I really hoped, that the objects I’d seen by my house would still be there when I got off, so that I could show someone in my family what I’d seen. I didn’t remember to look at the sky when I was on the platform because I was in a rush to get home, but when I was on the ground, about a block east of the train station, I walked southeast where there’s an open area of sky because of a parking lot. As I was crossing the street and heading south, I saw one of the objects or perhaps another one that was in the same vicinity of the ones I’d seen earlier. Only this time it was way closer to the ground than the ones I'd noticed earlier. I made my way onto the sidewalk and realized that the big concrete roof of the parking lot was blocking my view. So the object had to be very close to the ground because the roof of the parking lot is only about 15-20 ft high. I decided to back up a few feet and I walked in the street instead of the sidewalk in order to get a good look at the object.  I did, and basically I saw an object that resembled a saucer, but it wasn’t a flat thin disc, it had layers. The top layer was full of deep burgundy lights and so was the bottom one, I think they were on but they were very dull and nearly blended into the dark sky, that’s probably why I didn’t see them earlier. But the center layer was bright, bright white. The whole object was saucer shaped, and all of the lights looked like they were framed by rectangles. So they just looked like panels of lights. I do not know if I’d imagined it from the influence of TV and movies, but I do remember thinking that it hovered and rocked a little, instead of being completely still, but that could have been my mind adding that part in because I was so excited. As I kept walking south, my view was blocked again by the roof of the parking lot, so maybe the object had moved. About 20 seconds later, I’d moved past the parking lot’s roof, and parallel to the entrance of the parking lot.  This entrance isn’t enclosed by a roof, so there’s a very clear view of the sky but I still didn’t see the object. It was gone. I continued my way south and walked past the apartment building attached to the parking lot, which unfortunately blocked my view, because it too, is a high rise. About another 20-30 seconds later I continued my way south and crossed the street opposite this high rise, where there are just small houses and apt. buildings, which leave a better view of the sky and I still saw no objects, I headed east to get back to my building, and there still was no object in sight. But I kept my eyes on the sky for most of my walk and I did start to notice the stars, usually I don’t. They were visible, but since it’s Chicago and we have lots of lights and air pollution they aren’t blindingly white. So when I saw another object later on, I was totally sure it wasn’t a star.  I arrived inside my apt. at around 10:35 pm. About ten minutes later I turned off the light, in my bedroom and looked out of the window. I noticed a blinking object, west of my back window, which is further south in Chicago. It was much higher than the last one I’d just seen, and I would have taken it as a star if I hadn’t looked at the stars a few minutes ago when I was outside. This object was far away, but it wasn't as far as the stars were, and it was much brighter and bigger than the stars. It's light was white but it blinked on and off. I made out a reddish light that came from it as well. It too seemed to stand still and I think it was probably the same object that I’d seen 20 minutes before, when I was outside. But I’m not sure, I couldn’t tell its shape from so far away.  As I was gazing at the sky, I then saw a really large object traveling somewhat close to the ground, maybe 30 miles above that had a bright light attached underneath it. It was large and it was loud. I ran to the front of my apartment to get a better look, because it was fast and I believe this was a plane, but I do not believe it was a commercial plane, because it was so bulky, and because of the light coming from it, and because it was a dark color, I think it was a brown or bronze type of shade. It quickly covered the sky and was out of my sight within a minute or two, so I went back to the my other window to see the blinking object. It was still there, but it looked even further away, yet it was still very bright though. So I just decided to watch some TV because I couldn’t do anything about it and then I went to bed.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
two objects near O'Hare, July 2007;2007-07-05 11:00:00;5 minutes;two objects near O'Hare, July 2007 In the first week of July, 2007 I observed something interesting in the vicinity of O’Hare airport.   I work in Oakbrook Terrace, IL in the only tall building around, Oakbrook Terrace Tower.  My office is on the 15th floor and faces NE.  I was looking out the window at a more northerly angle, watching planes making their approach to O’Hare when I noticed a dark gray cloud, for the lack of a better word, hovering near the airport.  I say cloud because the edges did not seem well defined.  From my vantage point, I would estimate that the cloud was about a quarter to half mile south of the airport, at approximately 500 ft off the ground.  The cloud was  about 150-200 ft in length and 50 ft in height.   I thought it was a strange cloud at first, but watched because it was so odd looking and just a little out of place.  There were high level clouds that day but nothing anywhere near as low.  After a minute, another identical cloud approached the first from the north and hovered at the same height about 100 feet away.  The first cloud then slowly moved off to the north, followed by the second cloud about 15 seconds later.  I have kept an eye on that area since and have not seen anything else out of the ordinary.  ------------ ]           ] ] ohare     ] ]           ] ------------  O objects     O  Oakbrook tower ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Dancing Dazzling Lights Up In The Sky;2007-11-06 05:38:00;10 minutes;Dancing Dazzling Lights Up In The Sky This was the weirdest thing that I ever seen in my whole entire life! I DO NOT know what in the hell these things that I’m seeing or what they are???  Very early this morning at 5:38am, I was on my way to work, while riding on the Chicago CTA Midway Orange Line Train, I happen to look out the window which was facing to the south or southeast. I had seen 8 round bright-lighted objects standing still in a hovering formation. 2 minutes later at around 5:40am as the Chicago CTA Midway Orange Line Train pulled up to the Halsted station on the corner of Archer Ave and Halsted, these so-called round objects had started to move in a different formation just as they were playing a game called follow the leader, acting as they were doing some kind of a weird dance in the sky. Each of these saucer shape objects had twinkling multi-colored lights with various color changes like: green, blue, red, orange, pink, and purple. One of the saucer shape object had flashed a very bright beam down to something or someone, I couldn’t tell because there were lots of obstacles in the way from where I was looking. These object were about 200 feet off the ground and they were very close like about 2 or 3 city blocks from a distance. I DO NOT know what in the hell I had seen this morning, but it was the weirdest thing that I ever seen in my whole entire life! Man! It was weird! Strange and Bizarre!  Can someone out there please tell me and confirm this? And tell me what was it that I had seen this morning???…;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

Notched disc with slow wobbly movement at O'hare Terminal 3 observed at close range in daylight.;2008-08-04 19:01:00;60 seconds;Notched disc with slow wobbly movement at O'hare Terminal 3 observed at close range in daylight. While waiting in the lobby at AA Gate K-7 at Chicago O'hare my wife noticed a disc-shaped object hovering at an altitude of several hundred feet outside the terminal's large glass windows to the WSW at 7:01 pm.  She called my attention to it and several other people rushed to observe the estimated 30-40 foot in diameter object as it wobbled but deliberately moved to our left (NNE) between Concourse K and L toward the main body of Terminal 3.  It took about 60 seconds to enter and exit our field of view. Its destinctive peripherial protrusions, like notches on a gear, were its primary identifying feature to me.  It was dull gray (my wife noticed orange/rust) with an undulating movement.  It traveled low under the cloud ceiling. We laughed and moved closer to the windows and I told my wife to try for a phone camera shot but she couldn't manage it in time.  Another lady asked what in the world is such a big flying hubcap doing out there.  Others looked and turned their heads in disbelief. Prior to the sighting there was very little aircraft activity in this wing of O'hare.  There was a burst of aircraft activity after the object departed and a large storm moved in at 7:30 pm.  An aircraft appeared to be disabled during the 7:00-8:00 pm period.  Tornado warnings and high winds followed and passengers took shelter in the tunnels of O'hare.  We finally departed on AA 1058 to Orlando from Gate K-15 at about midnight.

FLAT BLACK COLOR DISC.;2010-02-04 18:10:00;1.5 seconds;FLAT BLACK COLOR DISC. 4-2-2013 18.10 CST Sighting of disc as it was traveling level close to the roof tops due South coming towards my front room windows. Just as I saw it starting to climb up it also changed at 45 degree angle to the East and upward as I only saw the bottom.  It was only then I realized it was not an radio controlled model, because of the size as it got closer approx. 200 yards in diameter.  It stared to climb the unit increased its acceleration as I moved off the couch to get a better look that baby was gone. I was talking with my Daughter who had her back towards the windows I told her look as it started the climb but she looked the wrong direction. But she said there were people in the street looking that way too. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
I See Disk Objects with Red and Blue Lights (Circling the Disk)  hovering over Chicago Skies.;2013-11-28 18:00:00;all night;I See Disk Objects with Red and Blue Lights (Circling the Disk)  hovering over Chicago Skies At least twelve years I have seen disk objects in the sky. Red and blue lights are around  these  disk objects constantly circling the disk.  They mostly hover but oh they do move and can move extremely  fast but they can also move slow.   I see them very often in Chicago skies on the South East side  and South West side.   Last seen  November  28, 2013.   Now I see these same objects in the South Loop  Sky  Last seen November, 2013  I can only see them at night, never in the daytime or on a rainy day!  Always more than one.  First encounter was frighting  because one  started coming at me really fast, I saw  the dome  over the disk and it was bright inside the dome and something seated inside on the right side my right it would be the disk left side.  I ran inside.  I was on the second  floor balcony of a two story building (1999).  2013 I still see these disk objects in Chicago Skies.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

Disc shaped light over Chicago.;2020-04-21 21:00:00;15;Disc shaped light over Chicago Sitting out side in the backyard with family enjoying a fire at night. We looked up at the stars and see a disk shaped light moving across the sky.  It was highe r then any plane and definitely not a shooting star.  It goes far north out of the field of vision. About 5-8 minutes later we see a jet way up in the sky with flashing lights.  And behind the plane we see the same disc shaped light trailing behind the plane.  Heading north then the ufo veers to the east and It then continues.  We are all watching it and then the light disappears.  If this would have been a plane or some other known object it would of been complete visible at that distance. This was a clear night sky many stars visible almost no clouds.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
Chicago: Shiny disk shaped UFO in daylight;2020-12-15 11:00:00;&lt1min;Chicago: Shiny disk shaped UFO in daylight I saw a shiny object from my window in high rise apartment in downtown Chicago.  Object was moving around and seemed to be heading West (my view faces North).  At first I thought it could be a balloon that was shining from the sun reflection but it seemed bigger and decided to get it on video.  After zooming in and further analyzing the video it looks like a saucer/disk/ship.  It went fast, I was able to look at it for about 10-15 seconds before grabbing my phone and recording it a 6 second video before it disappeared from my field of vision.  As you can see in the video the object maneuvered and did some kind of flip in which you can see the bottom angle of the disk as well. I would like to note that I saw a helicopter flying in the distance shortly after seeing the object (might be unrelated but mentioning just in case), the helicopter was not flying on the same direction where I saw the UFO.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
