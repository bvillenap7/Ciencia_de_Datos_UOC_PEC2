I am submitting this report on the behalf of my brother who is on the road a lot: A more detailed description will be sent via e-mail including a witness drawing of the object and a map showing witness location and object direction. The object was grey cigar shaped and an estimated few thousand feet up. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of event was amended by investigator in the Yukon, Canada.  Date is changed here.)) Subject:         Correction to UFO Report in your Database Date:             Sun, 21 Nov 1999 12:20:16 -0700 From:            ((name and e-address deleted))@yknet.yk.ca> To:               ufocntr@nwlink.com This report accompanies a National UFO Reporting Center UFO Sighting  Report Form which was filled out on your web site August 22,99:  http://www.ufocenter.com/S8770.html  I must apologize that the date of the sighting should be July 5th, 1999 and not June 5th, 1999. My brother distinctly recalls it being the day after the July 4th celebrations.  Here are more details of the sighting:  I am a UFO investigator in the Yukon Territory and am submitting this  report on the behalf of my brother who had a UFO sighting near Chicago.  I interviewed him on July 22nd. He is on the road a lot so if you need  further information from him just contact myself.  The map attached shows the witness was driving along I-90 south  eastbound. The witness first observed the object at point A and last  observed it at point B.  Arrows indicate the approximate direction of  the UFO at both points A and B. The curve in the road allows for a nice  triangulation if the object was stationary. It appeared to be stationary  to the witness. He initially thought it might be a blimp or a tethered  balloon, perhaps something to do with the July 4th celebrations.  However, the cylindrical and slightly tapered shape perplexed him.  Didn't match the shape of a blimp or balloon (See attached drawing).  The object looked fairly large and was just above the horizon and an  estimated few thousand feet up. It was gray in color  He observed the object for an estimated 5 to 10 minutes while driving  between points A and B and lost it due to the right-hand curve in the  freeway at point B. The turn caused his vehicle to face away from the  object. The time was roughly 3 in the afternoon. The sun was shining but  the overall sky had a whitish-greyish cast, it wasn't a clear blue sky.  Hope this is of use. It may be possible to inquire in the area if there  was some sort strange shaped blimp/ballon in the area the day after July  4th holiday. Please let me know if you find out anything.  Sincerely  ((name deleted)) Whitehorse, YT  (867)((number deleted));41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

A second unit filming a locked off shot of a clock in the forground with the Chicago Sky Line in the back ground caught a UFO flashing across the sky line.  IT traveled so fast that notonly did no one report it on location but it would have been hard to see in the footage had not our post production people gone into the footage to do a frame by frame enhancment of the digital clock.  They found something that at first they thought might be a scratched negative.  Upon closer and fuller examination, we have so far determined that this is a UFO traveling at what we consider a phenomenal speed traveling across the skyline and turning at the end.  I would appreciate any independent opinion on this footage. We have negative of footage, we have transfered the footage to HI-Def 24P video.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
3 cigar shaped lights;2005-08-05 22:10:00;5 minutes;3 cigar shaped lights Three cigar shaped lights came down from the sky similar to fireworks. They moved in different directions and the light would fade in and out. It was thought to be fireworks or missles from a terrrorist attack until the light faded out and changed direction like it was dancing or swirling. It was towards down town chicago.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
Saw a Cigar like object that flashed a red beam at my face;2006-02-28 20:00:00;5 to 10 mintues;Saw a Cigar like object that flashed a red beam at my face Feb. 28 2006, It was Wednesday night around 8 pm cst. I was heading home on heading south on Western Ave. at around 27st. I noticed a bright light to the left side in the sky. I thought it was an airplane as I see many airplanes in that area because they are heading to Midway airport to land. As I kept going on southbound on Western Ave. I kept getting close, but it looked weird. It look like a plane with no wings and it had lights flashing. The lights look like they were dancing. So I speed up and made a right hand turn at 36th street and parked at the corner. I didn't get off the my car, but I opened the window. As it passed westward I saw this on its side. When I said this is no plane, a red light flashed in my face. It disorientated me for a few seconds. It seemed like a sign telling me they saw me. As It continue westward, it turned now heading southbound. It seemed it picked up speed and I didn't see it anymore.  I was 5 mintues away from home. When I got home my mom was making something to eat. I went right to the mirror to see if there was anything on my face because I felt a burning sensation. I even asked my mom if she noticed anything on my face. She said no. I went to my parents bedroom where my dad was and told him, dad you are not going to believe what I saw. He said to me that he heard it pass by. Before telling him anything. My dad said he heard a hover/murmur noise. My dad said he even look out his bedroom window to see what it was, but he didn't see anything just the noise.  Well, this is my story. It is a bit lenghtly, but this is my experience what happened.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

I was standing on my back porch looking west when I look up and seen what I thought was an airplane shooting across the sky but the more I look at it it look like it was going stright up and out of the sight.   Now the only thing that really make me notice is I watched an airplane go through the same cloud, and came out the other side but this craft did not.

Another mysterious vehicle observed, Chicago fireworks display, July 4, 2011.;2011-07-04 21:35:00;20 min.;Another mysterious vehicle observed, Chicago fireworks display, July 4, 2011. On July 4th, 2011, we were watching the fireworks on our highly tuned 40 in. t.v. when we noticed that through the actual explosions, and much higher than the horizon seen ufo, was a slowly moving {from the perspective of the viewing camera} cigar shaped craft lighted on the front and rear, with a group of lights, possibly square shaped, and from camera view moving slowly  to  the left.  This occurrence lasted during a display of what one could describe as flashes of sparkles, through which my wife and I could perceive this vehicle.  I hesitated to inform  the center because concurrently there was a search for a recent drowning victim by a helicopter, but upon reflection there would be little chance of such machine being that high and in reasonable distance from  the explosions.   I have been told  by Mr. davenport to contact the T.V. stations to have them confirm what we saw.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
Shiny silver blimp-like aircraft - no wings..;2012-08-02 15:00:00;<5 minutes;Shiny silver blimp-like aircraft - no wings.. I was driving south on Pulaski Rd. @ Avondale Ave. which is just past the Kennedy Xway, and I happen to look up because weather reports were for rain.  The sky background was not cloudy by grayish and dark as though an artist was painting a background in one fell swoop.  In FRONT of the background was a SILVER (shiny and bright) ship looking like a BLIMP, more than a cigar shape. I thought it strange because I did look for wings and there were none.  It appeared to be facing east. I looked away at the traffic in front of me (bumper to bumper) and then looked back at the sky and no more blimp!  I looked at the sky as much as I could from the driver's seat of a car and could not see any blimp.  I did see see a regular passenger plane flying west towards O'Hare about 3 to 4 seconds after seeing the blimp. I pondered what I saw later and surmised that it did not appear that the blimp was moving at all or hardly at all.  The entire episode lasted less that 4 or 5 minutes.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

We stepped into the alley, emptied the cans, and returned to our yard.   My daughter was walking approximately five feet ahead of me when she stopped and said “what is that?  It can’t be a plane, it’s not moving.”  She was pointing east, from our back yard, at the sky.  The object’s distance from us, had to be less than half a block.  It was clear and visible. We get a lot of air traffic in our area, planes heading towards Midway airport.  We are absolutely familiar with what planes look like at night, as well as helicopters.  I myself am a retired law enforcement officer.   I looked at the object she pointed at and observed the same- this object was not moving.  It was static in the night sky, in a cloudless location.  It had white-red oscillating lights, nothing like the lights of an airplane in configuration.  It was horizontal in shape, and flattened.  I assumed we were looking at it side-on.  If I had to guess, it would have been about the same length as a mid-sized vehicle. We observed the object for a full two minutes.  It remained totally, unequivocally stationery.  The temperature outside had to be in the low twenties, and I seriously doubt it was a blimp or other airship.  It made no noise, as we were waiting to hear if we could detect the sound of helicopter blades.  There was absolutely no noise. After two minutes of observation, I told my daughter to run inside and get my second daughter for another witness.  As my second daughter left, the object dimmed, and vanished.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
