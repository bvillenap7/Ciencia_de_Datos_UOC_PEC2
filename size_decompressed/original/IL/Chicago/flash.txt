We're 7 stories up in our building, and if you looked west/southwest and held your arm up at a 45 degree angle, that was the approximate trajectory/elevation.  It flashed orange, brightly, and our power dimmed shortly.  There are no power lines up that high in our area, and no transformer boxes either.  my wife, who usually laughs at me when I talk about UFOs and other 'theories', was really disturbed...;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
brief expansion of a wand of light, that dissapeared as quickly as it appeared.;2006-08-12 04:15:00;less than 1 second;brief expansion of a wand of light, that dissapeared as quickly as it appeared. I spotted a UFO at 4:15 this morning right out in the back of my building while I was just stepping out to walk my dog!  At first I thought it must be a shooting star but it was so different and the more I thought about it the more I realized I had just seen something that had to be a UFO.  I litterally thought as I walked out of my door,  I wonder if I'll see a UFO today since I'm walking the dog by myself, and as soon as I thought it, there was this ball of light that stretched itself shortly across the sky like a rod, like a star wars light saber, and then just dissapeared in a split second.  It was right there in my field of vision right when I thought maybe I'll see a UFO.  The light was crisp and uniform, there was a definite point of origin, no streaking tail or breaking up, just a pure band of luminessence.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
Chicago Flash of Light;2006-09-28 03:01:00;2 seconds;Chicago Flash of Light North Chicago- Myself and two friends saw a sudden flash of light in the sky. 3 am, clear skies no rain no lightning. Looked very similar to lightning falling from the sky but not in an bolt pattern, more like a ball falling through the air, flashed very bright, then disappeared. As stated no rain or storms in the area, no clouds and no lightning storms. Was not a rocket or firework of any kind. No sound just a brilliant flash.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
Flashing white light was traveling across the sky from south to north, at an incredible speed, and gone within seconds.;2008-07-06 21:30:00;4-5 seconds;Flashing white light was traveling across the sky from south to north, at an incredible speed, and gone within seconds. I live in the northwest suburbs of Chicago. There were a few planes flying around either taking off from or circling to land at Oâ€™hare Airport. The skies were mostly clear, with some clouds in the distance and at 9:30pm I was standing outside looking southwest almost straight up in the sky and saw a quick white flash of light, almost like the flashing lights you see from a plane but a little brighter and caught my attention. This light would blink about every other second, but what I experienced  was the speed of this light. The distance between each blink of light was incredible.  I saw this light coming from the south moving north in a straight line and lasted four to five seconds before disappearing in the distance.  All the planes in the sky seemed to be moving in slow motion after watching this sighting.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
A UFO only in that the phenomena is currently unidentified.;2008-10-09 21:05:00;A few seconds;A UFO only in that the phenomena is currently unidentified. I was walking my dog at approx. 9:05 p.m., from north to south. I just happened to glance skyward and I saw a bright flash with a tail travel rapidly across the sky in a roughly west to east direction. The object's brightness grew in intensity to a bright blue-white light and rapidly faded out as it travelled across the sky. From what I can recall (I haven't had a chance to post something until now), I believe the object was slightly below the moon at that time. I'm a casual aerospace/astronomy enthusiast and have seen lots of shooting stars before, but this seemed bigger, brighter and more prominent. It appeared to travel slightly slower than a usual shooting star as well. I don't think this was an alien spacecraft but could it have been some space junk re-entering the atmosphere or perhaps an iridium flare? The only reason why I'm not sure about an iridium flare is because it did seem to have a flaming tail to it, but it could have been an illusion.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
