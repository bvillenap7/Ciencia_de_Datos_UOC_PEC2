I awoke at 3:00AM went to my refrigerator to get something to drink then went to the window looked out and just above me was a saucer oval shaped with white lights streaming out very bright, it stood there for about 10 seconds and like lightening disappeared over Lake Michigan.

After realizing that it hadn't moved in the 5 minutes I examined it through binoculars and quickly called my roommate (who described the same thing).  See description below. After calling my roommate upstairs I stuck a pair of binoculars in his hands and, before telling him what I saw, I asked him to describe what it looked like to him.  Through the binoculars he saw five or six lights arranged in a compressed oval pattern.  Through the binculars each of these lights seemed rather faint, but with the naked eye it was very bright and impossible to miss the colors flashing between red, blue and white (the colors changed rapidly, more than a strobe light even).  To my surprise, he was seeing EXACTLY what I was seeing.  We watched it for about twenty minutes and, before we decided to give it a rest, what was originally five or six lights had become one -- perhaps whatever it was was moving farther away, although it seemed to hold the same position for the time we watched.  (I continued to watch it from my bed -- I'm in a loft and have a terrific view of the sky.) If I had to pinpoint an exact location of the light, I would place it at at least two miles away in the SW sky over Lake Michigan.  I'm on the North Side, so I guess that would put it parallel with the Lincoln Park/Gold Coast area.  It could easily have been overlooked by people on the ground, but once they saw it I guarantee it would have raised an eyebrow. I don't know what it was, but I definitely know what it wasn't.  Any of your ideas or insight would be much appreciated.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
UFO spotted over o'hare airport.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting by airline employee.  PD));2000-06-26 23:20:00;ten seconds;ufo spotted over o'hare airport While working the night shift, at the airport, this was an event that actually took place. I would start by saying, someone, or a few people in the surrounding area, had to have witnessed the same event. In the local areas, there's the Hilton hotel, where someone possibly, may have been looking out of the window. Tower for air traffic control and the everyday travelers, some other eyewitness, to the event.  My job includes outside work. while I had noticed how clear it was that night, It was going through my mind, is that the big dipper or little dipper. At the left corner of my eye, I spotted this bright light, yellow/green in color.  The object was round from the bottom, flat, slowly moving over the top of the terminal building, near what was then called,  the round house.The object was smaller then the round house, mybe by a half size. Could it have been curious, about the shape, looking like it's own. This was a restaurant, with coffee shops etc.,on the top level.  The object was below the main tower, no more then a few hundred feet above the terminal bldg.. As it slowly moved, from where I was standing, towards the center of what airline employees call the ally, ramp area for taxing aircraft to the gates, I'm thinking, no noise is being made, I'm trying to make out some detail, there's to much of a glow. Then it was directly over my head, it stop for no more then one second, then it shot out towards my right. It moved so fast, you could see an after glow, tailing behind.  If you were to count, one, two,by three, it was over the trees, that's beyond the border of the airport.    My next thought, I need to get this down on paper. I ran into one of readyrooms, area for ground services, found a sheet of paper, and wrote down everything I had remembered. One thing I need to mention, a few days before, I heard on the radio, there was something that was picked-up on radar, eariler that week.  The explanation, one of the facility bldgs. being picked-up, it was nothing to be worried about. This was no dought, a cover-up.  As I mentioned before, someone else had to have seen it as well. I would hope, someone could come foreward, and varify my story, it's the honest to GOD true event that took place. I was told, say nothing, people will thing, your crazy. This was from a friend, who did not believe me. I believe the facts and the truth, need to be told. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous.  PD));41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
I saw 3-4 gray oval-shaped objects moving in the morning sky one blinking orangish lights.;2001-01-13 07:08:00;6 minutes - I had to then;I saw 3-4 gray oval-shaped objects moving in the morning sky one blinking orangish lights. It was Friday morning, and I was on the Jefferson Park train platform waiting for my 7:14 train to downtown Chicago. What first drew my attention to the sky was this orange smoke in the northeast...and then moving on into a trail as what a jet speeding across the sky would leave. To the east I saw a little gray oval-shaped disk moving in the sky. It seemed to be coming from the south toward the north. As I followed it - it turned back around and started going south again. I thought of the possibility of it being a UFO but was skeptical of such a thing. I looked farther into the south and saw 2 or 3 more coming...again, gray oval-shaped disks. I looked back at the first one I had seen and followed it with my eyes. A orangish light on the side of the UFO blinked 2 times and then stopped. In the northeast, a plane was going in the southwest direction. The UFO looked as though it would collide with the plane once they got close enough to do so. When it looked as if they were about to collide, the UFO ended up just passing underneath the plane. In the south, the other 2-3 UFOs were getting nearer. One thing to point out is they were not close together at all. They were all spread out individually in the sky. The train then arrived, and I boarded. The reason I chose to report this is because I read in the newspaper about light sightings over Rockford Thursday night. My sighting occured Friday morning and may have some connection to the Rockford sightings. NUFORC Note:  We suspect the alleged incident occurred in 2001, not in 2000, as indicated.  We have altered the date here.  PD));41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
Craft Orbiting the Moon...;2002-05-01 21:00:00;3 Minutes;Craft Orbiting the Moon... Peter,  When I started to hear what your guest saw, I knew it was EXACTLY what I saw thru my scope last year in the spring.     I have a 4.5 reflector, observing the moon, which was in half-moon stage.  I saw this object appear from the left... transit to the right and disappear into the dark portion side of the moon.  I could see the object shining against the black of the moon, and followed it move to the right of the moon until it disappeared. I kept viewing the moon...astounded.. and the object reappeared again from the left and traveled across the face toward the right once more!   This damned thing was ORBITING the moon!   It must have been incredibly huge in order for me to have viewed it.  It is described just as your guest had told.  I could not discern a shape, just a dark silhouette on the bright side, and a sparkle of light on the dark side of the moon. From what I could tell, it wasn't in close orbit to the moon, it was some distance away from it.  It would have to be in order for me to observe it.  I have been an amateur astronomer since a child,  taught astronomy, and have spent countless hours observing the heavens.  But I have never seen anything like this before or since.   It too spooked me. I have told some people, but they dismiss it.  I considered many factors such as a satellite, high flying birds, aircraft, but all do not fit in explanation.  I have caught Earthbound objects in the eyepiece, highflying birds and planes, but one tell what they are immediately. But this unknown object behaved in a different manner. And as this thing was viewed twice in a span of three minutes, it must have been orbiting the moon very quickly.  There is something up there, but it ain't of human construction.

They have a pool there, and it's open all night. I love to swim so I stayed in for a couple hours. When I got out, I was to wet to go back inside. So me and my Dad waited on the patio until I dried off. We were talking when my Dad saw it. It was a UFO. It was just three or four miles away and was VERY high in the sky. It was an oval ball of light. It just kind of hovered there for a minute or two. It slowly moved closer to me and my Dad. But then it sped off as if something scared it. Soaked or dry, I didn't care.

While sailing north towards Chicago on Lake Michigan we watched a dark shape against a clear sky hover over the shore/building line. It was about two miles away and seemed to change elevation slowly. I watched it with binoculars for several minutes, but could not get a good look at it since we were under sail. It could have been a ballon or a kite, but looked too large to be either. We could see all kinds of planes all around and the planes were easy to identify. This was no plane. We then lost sight of it when we approached the city.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
Two oval objects flying high over Chicago Sky;2005-09-24 18:30:00;5 min;Two oval objects flying high over Chicago Sky The sky was very clear and was able to see many commercial aircrafts flying too. But I have seen clearly two relatively small ovals (compared to seen aircrafts) flying apparently on much greater altitude. At the begining I though it is a ballon, but because I observed an organized movement pattern (zigzag) towards one direction (north east) I was surpurized. It took approximately 5 minutes for the two objects to pass over Chicago sky in almost the same path (one follow the other with huge distance between). The objects were surrounded with a hallow zone. Both kept flying and they started becoming smaller as they go higher and disappeared. The speed was almost constant (but even slower than the lower altitude aircrafts). I have seen the two objects clearily for the first time in my life!;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

It was above the 18-story building that fills 2/3rds of the view of my window.  It was traveling to my right from the time I first saw it and going in the direction of near south Chicago.  It was oval-shaped, 1/4 to 1/2 at arms-length, had no visible wings, moved as though it were floating on top of water, in a horizontal direction (i.e., did not ascend like a balloon would), and had a yellow hue.  It was moving away from me, so it was getting smaller, and then I lost it behind a building and in the gray clouds.  I called the lady who sits next to me to watch it, and she agreed that it was unidentifiable.  We watched it for about 30 seconds before we lost it behind the building.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

Amberish orb 20-30,000 ft above the night sky in Lincoln Park area Chicago, IL, Sept' 2009.;2009-09-13 21:00:00;2;Amberish orb 20-30,000 ft above the night sky in Lincoln Park area Chicago, IL Sept' 2009. On Sunday September 13, 2009, at approximately 9:00 PM, I and a few friends witnessed a hovering object high up in the night sky within the Chicago city limits, on the north side, Lincoln Park area. One hour after first spotting this object, I managed to take a picture using my 5MP camera phone with auto flash.  We watched this stationary object just sit idle in free air. Unfortunately, it took me a long time to take the picture because I didn't believe my friends who were outside watching it for an hour.  I stayed inside the house. Object's Position They said that it was a lot closer to the earth before I decided to go outside and view.  So the image I took was basically its very, very slow ascent back up into the stars.  Even though we were in downtown Chicago, it was a pretty starry night with some stratus clouds high up, but the only thing you can see in this picture is the brilliant amber-red spherical object. You don't see the stars in the picture, just the red object.  I tried magnifying the view of the object, but of course it's blurry.  I really need to share this story with someone credible if this helps us understand the big picture of things. Objects Ruled Out I'm not saying that what I saw was a UFO, but I can say that I have never seen any type of flying or floating vehicle, or weather condition, planet, satellite or lightning like the thing I saw that night. I'm so glad I was able to capture it when I did, because I was shaking and tried to grasp some kind of reasonable explanation for what I saw, but nothing came to mind.  I want to share with you my experience and photo if you are interested. This is a real image. You have to zoom to the red speck at the center.  This was taken at my friends place in the Lincoln Park subdivision of Chicago, the night of Sept. 13, 2009 during the Bears/Green Bay week 1 game at 9:00pm CST. This object appeared right around halftime facing the northwest horizon and much lower in elevation.  It stayed stationary, never changing direction.  I finally took this picture at approximately 10:00 PM. Object Hovers  What you see is something I and a few friends can't explain.  Outside the house my buddies were first to notice this thing around 9:00 PM.  They kept telling us to come out and watch this thing floating in the air and not moving.  We didn't believe him so we just kept watching the game inside. I finally gave in and went out to their backyard and witnessed what they were watching.  I could not offer any explanation to what I saw.  The following are things I have ruled out that this wasn't: -No aircraft (blimp, balloon, helicopter, airplane) -No comet, star or planet. -No low earth orbiting satellite Spherical in Appearance I could not decipher any shape of the object.  It looked spherical, and I couldn't tell if there were more than one.  It was definitely higher in elevation than the Sears Tower.  I'd say approximately more than 5,000 to 10,000 feet. My first reaction was to call someone miles away from our location just to verify the same unexplainable thing in the night sky.  Of course, nobody would answer their phone because they were probably watching the game.  I really wish I took video but I was actually shaking, because I was kind of excited to see this thing. It was amazing and frightened to watch.  I still want to believe that it was man-made, but my gut tells me that it's not, nor a natural phenomena;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

I noticed a black spot, which I initially thought was a bird, following along side and behind a plane and then swoop around to the front of the plane. It then followed along side and then drifted away from the plane.  I kept watching the spot move around a small patch of sky.  Its movement reminded me of a boat on water.  I say the shape was oval shaped in general, but at times appeared to be almost like a figure eight.  As the bus approached Higgins Rd I lost sight of the shape.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

I stepped out onto my 28th story balcony to see what why the sky was so lit up at 10:30 at night.  I immediately noticed an unusual aircraft at the center of the illuminated sky.  My initial reaction was that it was some new kind of advertising blimp with flashy lights.   As I continued to study the aircraft I realized how unfamiliar and strange it appeared and it seemed to be flying too high above the city to be advertising anything legible. Aircraft Description:  Single aircraft -Extremely bright  -Blinking lights, from white, to red, to blue  -Oval in shape  -Slow moving, almost hovering  -Strange flight pattern, (first moved NE, then came back and moved SW vanishing from the viewpoint of my balcony.)    Personal Reaction to the Sighting:  After staring for a few minutes in disbelief I grabbed my i-phone took two pictures and a brief video.  Called my mom, a few friends, and your hotline. My Background:  I was alone at the time this occurred, I had just come home from Father’s day dinner with my family and was getting ready to go to sleep. I am a 24 year old female,college graduate in Economics currently working in Finance and definitely not a person who has given UFO’s much thought until now. Seeking clarification on what I saw last night.  I’m fascinated by the possibility this could be an unknown, but I would like to know if what I saw was simply a blimp or some other man-made aircraft. If someone could look at my photos and videos and get back to me I would appreciate it. Did anyone else see this???;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
Very large white oval travelling at 300 miles per hour spotted over Chicago;2011-07-14 17:03:00;25 seconds;Very large white oval travelling at 300 miles per hour spotted over Chicago I live just west of Wrigleyville on Chicago’s north side.  At the time and date specified I was looking through the south-facing window of my top floor apartment.  The weather was clear with only high wispy cirrus clouds. I noticed an oval-shaped object which was quite some distance away, almost due south (SSE), and travelling westerly, with a color of white much like a cloud.  I would estimate the object to be three to four miles distant, and its size to be at about five or six jumbo jets in length.  Its height was approximately half its length.  The ends of the oval-shaped object appeared to be perfect semi-circles in shape, while the top and bottom were flat and horizontal, much like the “Begin” and “End” shapes on a flowchart symbol template. Since I live near Wrigley Field, where the Chicago Cubs play, I first assumed it to be an advertising blimp.  Wrigley Field often employs a blimp to circle the field with a promotional message during games.  But the object was as far distant south from Wrigley Field as I was (at least three miles), and though at first I did not think much of the object, what caught my attention was the enormous speed it would have to be travelling-much too fast to be a blimp.  Using my estimate as to distance and size of object, I estimate the object to have been travelling at about 300 miles per hour.  I will emphasize again that the object was very large. When the westward-travelling object got due south of me it made a gradual left turn and headed due south so I was viewing it end on.  It continued travelling south, but instead of slowly getting smaller with distance it seemed to quickly (within two seconds) fade from my sight altogether, which I thought was strange. Note:  I checked the Cubs schedule and they will be playing at home against the Florida Marlins starting at 7:05 p.m. tonight, some two hours after my sighting.   I went outdoors at 5:30 p. m. to check for an advertising blimp, but found none.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

Dark Grey oval shaped object flying above plane at high rate of speed;2012-07-25 02:15:00;5-7 seconds;Dark Grey oval shaped object flying above plane at high rate of speed I was standing outside on our back step having a smoke,at 2:15PM watching the planes going by from O’Hare airport as I see them every day, and can observe them very easily and their rate of speed From my line of sight I was watching one plane that was moving from the southwest to the northeast, and climbing   All of a sudden this oval shaped object, that was dark grayish in color, that made no sound, or had no lights,no Fins came streaking overhead, and I could tell that it was above the path of the plane where the clouds were. It was moving at such a high rate of speed that it crossed over and disappeared into the horizon in a matter of 5 to 6 seconds tops.  I had to shake my head and look hard to realize that I saw birds flying overhead, and there was the plane, moving off to the east, but what was the object that just blew past all of that?  It was not a missile, or a jet, or any other known thing, there was no noise, just movement at a high rate of speed!   Called the National Center for UFO sighting and spoke to the director and thanked him for letting me tell him what I saw, and as cliché as I have heard others say before, I’m not crazy, and I SAW EXACTLY what I have stated!;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
Several Yelowish-Orang to Red lights over West Chicago;2012-09-14 22:17:00;3-5 minutes;Several Yelowish-Orang to Red lights over West Chicago Mom and I were on our way to Chicago and took the I-94 exit for Belmont.  We traveled west and as we got to around Cicero I (the driver) noticed a few odd lights in the sky to the left.  They were traveling to the east.  I told mom to look and joked that they were UFOs, but said they could be lanterns.  Then, more lights came and they were all moving in the same direction along the same path.  I thought that they moved too deliberately for me to think they were lanterns, so gave up on that idea.  They may have been coming from somewhere around Midway airport area, but I am not sure.  There are airplanes that fly near the area, but these objects were definitely not jets or planes they were too numerous, slow and quiet. So I asked mom if she’d mind if we pulled over to look.  She didn’t mind as she was pretty curious too.  We stopped the car and noticed that more and more lights kept moving on the path in the sky.  We noticed that they were round (oval or orb-shaped) and yellow-orange.  Sometimes the lights would pulsate and change color, but not in unison.  They did this individually, deepening into a primary red-colored glow and back to orange or yellow.  Sometimes they would fade out until you couldn’t see anymore light-- but only a gray round object floating in the sky.  The streetlights obstructed some of our vision so we could only see them as they traveled towards us and next to us as they passed they faded into a light polluted area.  The unidentified lights were about low-cloud height, and could have been the size of a small car, I’m guessing-- I'm not sure how my judgement of this kind of thing is.  We saw as few as 50 or as many as a hundred… it is hard to tell since I understan! d that excitement can obscure one’s judgment of numbers. I tried to take pictures, but my phone's camera couldn't zoom in well enough and the streetlights obstructed the camera's ability to take in other lights.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

Second night of spotting reddish orange orb shape object in night sky.;2015-07-05 23:15:00;4 minutes;Second night of spotting reddish orange orb shape object in night sky. Yesterday, July 4, 2015, my 2 daughters and I reported on this site seeing 3 reddish orange orb shaped object appear in night sky around 9:00 pm going south to north.  Tonight, July 5th, 2015, I and my daughter went back out to see if we’d see another sighting of said object, and around 9:15 pm, we spotted it, reddish orange as before, going this time east to north, same reflective coloring, same straight mechanical movement, as bright as a star.   This time, using my telephoto lens, I took several photos of it.  Once again, it travelled north and we observed it as far as we possibly could before it vanished.  Tonight we only observed one orb;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
UFO over Wrigley Field.;2016-10-08 19:47:00;<1 second;UFO over Wrigley Field. My wife and I were attending the San Francisco Giants vs. Chicago Cubs NLDS baseball game on Saturday, October 8th at Wrigley Field in Chicago, IL.  We were seated in the center field bleachers.  We arrived early to the game, and having my Canon DSLR camera with me, I decided to walk around the bleachers and take some photos of the crowds both inside and outside the stadium.  As I walked behind the bleachers in left-center field, I took a photo of the people gathering on the rooftop of a building on the north side of Waveland Avenue.   Four days after the game, I uploaded the photos to my computer and was intrigued by what I saw in the photo of the rooftop crowd.  A fuzzy glowing object was in the sky in the distance to the north.  It’s a bit difficult to discern a definable shape (perhaps several interconnected spheres?), but hopefully some type of photo-enhancement software might bring it out better.  I noticed nothing in the sky when I took the photo.  The night was clear, there was no blimp present, nor did I see any nearby small planes or helicopters.  There was a slight breeze from the northwest, and I did see jet airliners to the north following their usual flight path from east to west to land at O’Hare International Airport.  They were large and clear in the sky, and this does not appear to be one of those. I am sending a full resolution jpeg to your email.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
