I turned to look and I confirmed his sighting. I continued driving and visually tracking the object while my wife and other son tried to see from theri position in the vehicle until the residential buildings block the view. I stopped the car in the middle of the street and ran toward the buildings trying not to loose sight of the object, I lost it. triangular, black , shiny black , from my position looked like flat of unidimensional tilted 6o degrees which allowed me to see the triangular shape.  Floating, no signs of engines, no noise, descending slow, tip of triangle foward.  I thought it was the stealth bomber B17, or maybe the blackbird sr71, but the way it was just suspended in the air and the way it came out of the clouds and desappeard have me thinking to this day.  Most shocking to me was that was flying contrary to the path taken by the planes coming to O'hare Int.  I feared a chrash, there are planes here all the time. We never talked about it till this day.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

I saw a triangle shaped craft moving from south to north-northwest.  There was a white spotlight at one corner and a green light at the two other corners. After about 20 minutes I went out my front door to get a better look.  It was a cold and windy night but the sky was clear. I stood on the sidewalk and saw the triangular craft again and then I noticed the other two craft and the lights were the same on them.  Now they didn't seem to be moving.  A man and a woman came by and I asked them if they believed in UFO's.  The man said they were in a hurry and they kept walking down the street.  Then a couple of minutes later another couple, a man and woman, came by and I asked them what did they think the lights were up in the sky.  After a minute the guy said he thought it might be a comet.  The woman said she thought she saw blue or green lights.  Then they left after a few minutes.  The craft still didn't seem to be moving and after about fifteen minutes I saw a small airplane, flying from north to southeast, fly under the large triangular object.   In comparison to the plane, the object seemed to be at least five times bigger than the plane.  After another 15 minutes observing the objects, the clouds started to move in and I went inside my house and didn't see them anymore.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
Triangular shaped, solid bright white with bright white tail, moving very fast over north/downtown Chicago, directly towards Lake Michi;1999-11-16 19:00:00;20 seconds;Triangular shaped, solid bright white with bright white tail, moving very fast over north/downtown Chicago, directly towards Lake Michigan. I live in Chicago and have a nice view facing south, towards the loop. Sometimes I enjoy watching planes fly above the city. I was looking out my window early in the evening on Tuesday, November 16, 1999, and I saw a very bright, white triangular shaped object with a long bright white tail. It looked large enough to be close but I didn't hear any sound from it. It moved directly east towards Lake Michigan and eventually I lost sight of it. I probably saw it for 15-25 seconds. I'm not saying I think it was a UFO, but I don't think it was a regular plane either. Plane lights generally flash, this object was a solid bright white the entire time. Plus, it had a very bright white tail. Finally, it moved very quickly. I think when a plane moves that fast it makes some sort of sonic boom sound. The main reason I'm reporting this is because I think anyone who saw it would be interested in knowing if others saw it. I'd like to know more about it.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

Telephoned Report:  A mother and daughter telephoned NUFORC on August 21, 2004, to report that they had witnessed a very peculiar event from their 22nd-floor apartment in downtown Chicago during the previous evening.  Both witnesses reported that they witnessed one, or more, bright lights, that “looked like fireworks, but with no tail,” moving toward their building.  Suddenly, the lights reportedly stopped, and turned into some type of unlighted ship, hovering motionless in the night sky.  Then, the witnesses reported, the first ship appeared to “split” into two seemingly similar-looking craft.  Neither of the witnesses thought she had ever seen a UFO before.

And they were hard to see because they blended into the cloudy night.They were making strange movements, like one came up close to the window, and when it came too close, it seemed to fade away or dissappear.One by one, the crafts flew up above the window and soon they were gone. But when I woke up the next morning, I saw 747s or jets out the window. Whatever I saw remains a mystery.  Those crafts were very, very strange.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
Large Hovering Triangle Observed in Chicago Suburbs November 2008;2008-11-23 18:00:00;5 minutes;Large Hovering Triangle Observed in Chicago Suburbs November 2008 During the fall of 2008, I commuted back and forth to O'Hare, arriving on Sunday afternoon/evening to work for the week, and leaving Friday afternoon.  I became very familiar with the flight pattern into and back out of the airport, having taken over 15 trips by the date of this sighting.   After arriving at the airport I would rent a car and travel East on Touhy to my hotel in Skokie.  Each week I enjoyed watching the incoming flight line.  Planes would only be about a few hundred to a couple thousand feet up at that point.  I knew this by listening to the flight deck communications when I would arrive.   On this Sunday early evening I noticed a particularly large aircraft with the typical front fuselage and side wing lights in a triangle pattern.  Usually the larger aircraft appear to be moving slowly due to their size.  As I traveled east on Touhy, however, I noticed that this large aircraft appeared to be moving too slowly - not what I was used to seeing.  Within a few moments I realized it was hovering, and the motion was mine.   As I approached Western Ave intersection I noted that it was hovering above buildings to my right.  I turned the corner on Greenwood to make a run around the block to hopefully see it from behind.  Instead I saw it in the same place as I rounded the block - it definitely was hovering, and it was a large dark triangle with a few lights to define its shape.   On Touhy again I decided to round the block one more time and stop on a side street to get out to have a look.  By the time I got to a stopping place it was gone.  At no time did I hear any noise from the object.   I am a research scientist with trained observation skills, and can say for sure that I saw a hovering triange shaped aircraft that was out of place in this area.  On my return to the airport Wednesday of that week (it was Thanksgiving week) it was daylight, and I noted that there were no towers or any other structures in the area that could have explained this craft.   I have permanently located to the Chica go area now and would be happy to review the sighting on site.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
Triangular aircraft, hovering, orange lights and no sound;2009-08-13 22:30:00;2.5 minutes;Triangular aircraft, hovering, orange lights and no sound To set things straight, I do not believe that intelligent life from other planets visit or have ever visited Earth. Once in a great while I check this sight because on two occasions in the past I have seen grey, airplane-like objects with no lights or markings or sound, gliding over Chicago. I never bothered to submit a sighting until now, noticing that what I saw recently matches the descriptions of other entries with coinciding dates. I was driving Eastward down Irving Park Road in Chicago and I looked out the window and saw a Triangular shaped object (with rounded corners) with approximately 6 orange lights around the perimeter on the bottom of the object. No other or flashing lights at all. It appeared to be the size of a commercial aircraft but definitely lower than one should be flying. It also appeared to be just hovering. Now that area is common for aircraft coming into O’Hare airport from the east at lower altitudes so I took that in consideration. I also took into consideration the speed I was driving. It also occurred to me at that time that the Chicago Air and Water show was in a couple days. I've never been to the Air and Water show but I do not believe anything like that is part of it. I pulled over and watched it just sit there, hovering. I had the window down and could not hear any noise other than the traffic. Then it started to slowly move to the South West. I looked over at the bus stop and saw a man in his 20s staring up at the sky with his jaw open (giving me validation). When I looked back up it was gone.

As lied down on the lawn  and looking toward the roof of my house and watched the stars suddenly a cluster of three light stocked together to a shape like a rounded cornered triangle suddenly appeared in the dark sky moving at a very high rate of speed from the  SE toward  NW direction without any sound. We watched  and wondered what it could have been......? I'm an airplane and space enthusiast and I can say with certainty what it was not !! It was not an airplane, it was not a satellite, it was not a commit, or not any kind of falling space junk. This is the first time in my life I can say with absolute certainty that I could not identify a flying object.......I would hate to say it was an alien craft because I don't believe in Intelligent extra terrestrial visits at all ! I was flying at a high altitude I would say as high as a! commercial airplane perhaps 30-40 thousand feet.silent completely for the duration we witnessed it. We were amazed of the speed and the strange shape....I would guesstimate the speed maybe twice or three times the speed of a satellite . So this is my story.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

The speed was neither fast nor slow. No sound accompanied the lights. The light on the lower left faded.  The other two lights remained in formation and continued to move on same path. I looked away to cross the street when I looked up all of the lights were gone.

It was close to sunset,there was no clouds in the sky and the sun was slightly to my right, while driving west I first noticed a bright object.  From the angle of the sun at first I thought it may be a plane with the sun reflecting the light, as I live near Midway airport.  As soon as I pointed it out to my girlfriend she was already pointing out to more of the same objects.  They appeared to be four individual sphere shaped objects forming a bird like v-shape.  We parked at observed the objects for a couple minutes and watched as they seemed to almost fade away and re appear while maintaining their v-formation.  I tried to drive around the block to get a better look but couldn't see them anymore, and pictures i took with cell phone caught nothing because they were to far away.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
Three white strobing lights in a triangular pattern;2011-07-05 22:40:00;5 seconds;Three white strobing lights in a triangular pattern We were at the U2 concert at Soldier Field.  It started to sprinkle a few drops so I looked up to see what the clouds looked like.  When I looked up I saw three white strobing lights heading East to West.  They were in a perfect triangle with what would appear to be the flat side facing forward in the direction of flight.  I am assuming that the three lights were on an object, I could not make out any structure between the lights. The object was passing in and out of the bottom of the clouds, although it never became fully obscured.  The MDW TAF says that there is a broken cloud layer at 5000 and a scattered layer at 12000, although the sighting was two hours previous to me checking the TAF. What I thought was odd was that the craft didn't have any beacons or navigation lights.  All I could see was the three simultaneously strobing white lights. There were other aircraft in the sky, there were two helicopters circling almost constantly. For background I am a professional aircraft mechanic and have worked at O'Hare for the past 22 years. I am very familiar with aircraft and their lighting patterns.  This is unlike anything I have seen before. There was no way to tell if it made any sound.  The concert was very loud.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
Three orange-red lights in shape of triangle with fourth light approaching during an intense lightning storm.;2011-07-23 23:47:00;approx 2 min;Three orange-red lights in shape of triangle with fourth light approaching during an intense lightning storm. My mom told me to look out the window to look at the lightning, as she was downstairs looking out the window.  I looked out my bedroom window which is upstairs.  I saw three orange-ish red lights in the shape of a triangle in the southern sky.  They were rotating and gyrating while staying in shape. It was approx. 40 degrees high in the sky.   My mom did not see them because a tree was blocking her view.  My brother and I ran downstairs and outside to get a better look. My parents followed us.  It was lightning and thundering in the distance and as the lightning lit up the sky I saw a black colored center with the three lights on each corner but that was the only time I saw the center.   As it moved across the sky to the west, a forth light approached from the lower left side of the triangle. It didn't appear to be connected to the other three lights, but it was the same orange-red color.   As it came closer to the triangle shape only one of those lights was still vis! ible. Then both lights faded into the clouds.  It was really intense cloud cover with an extreme amount of lighting. We didn't see it again after that.  The whole sighting was approx. 2-3 minutes.  We didn't even think to take a picture of it until it was out of sight.  My mom did try to find our binoculars but didn't in time.  My mother, father and brother all witnessed the event.  My mother made a police report with 911 and reported it to local news stations via emails.   We are curious if anyone else saw it or have pics to prove what we saw.  I had my cell phone in my pocket but was too awe struck to even think of taking a picture.  We were kind of paralyzed by the thought of what we were witnessing.  It was exactly the triangle shape like people describe.  As a family, we are changed forever by this sighting.   We will never forget this night!!!;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

Tonight I walked outside to smoke a cigarette on my front porch.  It's a very clear night right now.  I looked off to the southern sky and noticed what I thought must be a satellite. I have lived near ohare airport for most of my life, this was absolutely not any type of airplane.  The light had a reddish rusty tinge to it.  It appeared to be slowly moving towards the west, in a steady motion.  After roughly 30 seconds of observation it immediately changed its direction.  I was very startled and got an immediate rush of fear. This object then appeared to sway back and forth in a slow steady way.  I got the feeling I was being watched. This object then stopped movement for a good 5 min.  I ran inside to grab my phone to take a picture. I was inside for less than a min and when I returned I noticed the object had changed position.  The object was too far up to get any good pictures. I then noticed that there was three distinct edges that had very dim lighting on them.  By now this object was almost above me, there were two closely placed lights that seemed to be on the underside of the object. I had another strong rush of fear and feeling it knew it had been spotted.

I was letting my dog out into the yard and looked toward the sky, as I waited by the door.  I thought I saw a large triangular shape in the sky in the distance coming from a southeastern to northwestern direction, but it almost looked camouflaged by the night sky.   As it got closer, I saw round red balls of light moving closely together, perhaps 10-20.  I watched it come directly over my house and it did not make one sound.   I realized the lights were underneath something, but as I said, it looked like it would fade in and out of the dark sky or was camouflaged by the sky.  I felt like I didn’t want to take my eyes off of it.   After I let my dog in, I ran through the house to the front door to see if I could follow it toward the west, but it had disappeared.  I live fairly close to an airport and always see and hear planes in the sky, whether they fly high or low, but this was not like anything I had ever seen before.  It didn’t make one sound, and was large!   My husband and son weren’t home, and my neighbors weren’t in their yards.  I wish someone else would report this – sure would make me feel a lot better.

I had to block the street lights from view and their orange glow to see the stars but they were still very clear for Chicago, and then as I was staring at the constellation Orion and Sirius, three red lights in a triangle shape with a dark barely visible frame or body above them began passing through what looked like fairly low altitude and mostly opaque clouds right in the left and center of my field of view. They seemed to appear out of nowhere and the craft appeared to be very large (about 1.5 from my perspective and I'd estimate that it was at an altitude of 10,000 ft and approximately 10 miles away from me). It moved forward slowly bearing east to west and then only slightly but immediately it elevated and then went back down in altitude, it shifted speeds and altitudes as it passed into the orange glow reflecting up from the city.  I tried to take out my phone camera but it was too late and I was too affixed during the incident to break my focus.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
Two triangular shaped objects with flashing white lights over the southside of Chicago.;2017-04-04 21:20:00;15min;Two Triangular shaped objects with flashing white lights over the Southside of Chicago. Sitting in my bedroom and hearing the sound of a helicopter that was very loud, I  got up to look out of my window, and saw the the helicopter hovering over the expressway in the S.E.sky.  As I was about to sit down, out the corner of my eye, I noticed very high in the S.W. sky a triangular-shape object with five white lights on each side, and one big light in the center. To make sure I wasn't seeing things, I took out my binoculars, and noticed a smaller triangular shape object next to the big one with flashing white lights.  After watching it for fifteen minutes it disappeared.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

Massive triangle zooms over Chicago’s west side;2019-10-16 19:25:00;2-3 seconds;Massive triangle zooms over Chicago’s west side On Wednesday October 16 between 7:25 and 7:35 PM I saw I very large triangle with a light on each corner fly from north to south in a straight line, pointy end first. It took about 2 seconds to fly across the sky and out of view. I would guess at least the size of a football field though it’s hard to say what altitude it was at. About 2 full moons across, or if holding a ruler at arms length about 3-4 inches on the ruler. The lights on the corners were very large, facing down, and very dim, yellowish, not as bright as the stars or planes over head. No flashing lights or lights in the middle, just the 3. Completely silent. I was standing in Logan Square (Chicago) facing west. If it wasn’t going so fast I would have tried to take a picture or video but then again it was so dim so it might not have been captured. This was just after sunset and there  was lots of ambient light. I would say it was definitely faster than the jets during the air and water show. Any! one facing west and looking up would have seen it, it may have been dim, but it was brazen, unmistakable and unmissable for the two seconds it took to fly from one end of the sky to the other. There were aircraft in the vicinity but none chasing the object, which I imagine to be impossible. I would also like to include that it was flying virtually parallel to the streets that run north-south, so not traveling southwest or southeast etc.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
