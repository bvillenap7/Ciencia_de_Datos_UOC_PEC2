Diamond shaped object, orange in color with small points of light surrounding the main body;2001-08-05 03:15:00;1.5 - 2 min;Diamond shaped object, orange in color with small points of light surrounding the main body Myself and 10 friends were sitting outside on a patio at approx. 3:15am. Approx 20 minutes after some of us saw a very bright meteor overhead we saw an object in the distant sky in the SE heading NW at a constant rate of speed. As it grew closer it appeared to be diamond shaped and an orange in color. It flew directly overhead and at its closest appeared to be about 1/2 the size, possibly 3/4 the disk of a full moon. There was a near full moon this night so I did try to make a rough comparison. I saw it pass in front of a bright star which confirmed to me that is was indeed a solid object and gave me a very immediate sense of depth that it was somewhat low in the sky but how far up it was I could not say for sure. It appeared to be luminescent in some fashion but illumination by the moon could not be ruled out as it was a very clear night out and the moon was bright enough to light up the lawn. Several people in the group described several small points of light, like the ends of a fiber optic cable said one friend (number varies between 6 and 7) offset but surrounding the diamond shape. I am slightly nearsighted with a -.5 prescription and unfortunately was without my glasses this night so I was not able to make out the surrounding lights personally but I very clearly saw the orange body of the object. As it passed overhead we heard absolutely no noise coming from the object. Minutes after the object disappeared from sight an airplane took off heading east over our heads from O'hare airport. The comparison to a low flying commercial airplane was easily dismissed as we observed blinking navlights on the wing-tips of the plane, take off lights and an audible engine noise. The observed craft had neither of these. As the craft receded from us a girl in the group grabbed her 35mm camera and attempted to photograph the object with her telephoto lens and managed to take two pictures of it. At this time it was pretty far away so we are not anticipating a detailed image. The group of witnesses of saw the object consisted of people between the ages of 24 and 30 working in fields from business to art. Some of the group are very admitted skeptics and others are believers in the UFO phenomenon but the group consensus from both sides of the fence was that no one had ever seen anything like it before and could offer no explanation other than possibly a blimp or a balloon. Before we got in to to much detailed description within the group I had two of the witnesses go inside the house and draw the object independently based on their own description. I personally am into astronomy as a hobby and have witnessed meteors and satellites many times to know exactly what they look like. I can identify all the visible planets as well as the star Sirius. I know it was neither of those. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and we found him to be an excellent observer and reporter of the facts surrounding the case.

Greenish Diamond shaped object with five smaller orbs in formation, daytime.;2007-08-26 14:30:00;15 minutes;Greenish Diamond shaped object with five smaller orbs in formation, daytime. I was waiting for my wife today in our yard, and I looked up into a crystal blue sky and saw what appeared to be a star in the sky.  I was wearing polarized sunglasses and this object was not visible to the naked eye. There were several jet aircraft in the sky at the same time, but this object was much higher up, I thought it might have been the international space station or something.  I went and grabbed my binoculars and I was astounded to see a greenish glowing diamond shaped object, which had five orbs in a formation heading from the north to the southeast. For a second I thought it was a balloon or something, but this object was diamond shaped and had a glowing greenish hue, and had to be near sub orbital, and left no contrails to be a jet plane.  I observed these objects for about ten to fifteen minutes, I showed my wife and her mom and a family friend and they were astounded. The five orbs seemed to be out in front of the greenish diamond object in a perfect formation pattern their size was much more diminished compared to the greenish object. I didn't even notice them at first and spotted them after watching the Diamond shaped object. I must emphasize that these objects could not be seen with the naked eye, and if I did not have my sunglasses on, I would not have even seen the intial object. I searched the sky to make sure I was not in fact seeing stars, but no other objects similar to it could be seen in the crystal blue sky’s background.  After sometime of viewing them, about only fifteen minutes the objects I was observing simply vanished.  I live on the North side of Chicago and see Aircraft on approach to O’Hare international every day, but these objects had to be 50’000 feet or so, and the greenish Diamond object had to be quite large as it appeared to me to be a star. ((FOLLOW-UP FROM SAME WITNESS)) follow up I contacted the flight service station and for my report they told me the following  45 thousand feet winds were at 290@33 53 thousand feet winds were at 300@16   I saw the formation moving from the North to the Southeast.

More Chicago UFO's;2007-09-29 10:30:00;30 minutes;More Chicago UFO's I was drawn to my window due to the sound of helicopters.  They are becoming more frequent in Chicago but only justified by the Olympic bid.  Crime is low and the culture is very civilized.  So why the multiple copters and the amount of time they are flying ?  Upon noticing the over abundance of helicopter activity I begin to look out the window of my 6th floor apartment facing west.  As I observe the ghetto birds in action I notice what I've never noticed before a dimond shaped light in coming due west.  This light resembled the light a star emits.  The only distinguishable difference between this light and a star was it's sheer size and lack of accute stationary form.  It hovered left to right and was much larger than a star (or moon) and was most certainly more illuminated than a star.  What was it ?  And why have I personally witnessed objects in the sky that I've never seen before at some a frequent pace (the 3rd time in 4 months I've witnessed a UFO or ARV), why were the helicopters flying for so long and in such numbers, and why was this in the vacinity of O'Hare again ?  Was I the only one to see this ?;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
Bright light seen over the city of Chicago.;2008-01-22 18:00:00;2 minutes;Bright light seen over the city of Chicago. My boyfriend and I live just south of downtown Chicago, about a block east of the lake. Last night I was sitting out on our fire escape between 6 and 6:30 PM. I looked out to the north and in the distance saw a bright white light resembling a giant star moving straight up into the sky. After watching in for a few seconds I called my boyfriend out to show him what I was seeing.  Being a skeptic he was more amazed than I was about the light in the sky.  We also saw commercial airplanes around the craft and they looked tiny in comparison, as did the stars visible in the sky. It was moving relatively quickly and now moving towards us.  As it got closer it appeared possible that there were two curved wings coming off of the flying craft.  We watched it until it disappeared behind our 11-story apartment building.  There was no sound we could hear coming from it.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

3 Lighted Objects Spotted in Chicago 9-14-2012;2012-09-14 20:40:00;1 minute;3 Lighted Objects Spotted in Chicago 9-14-2012 We got a call from a relative 2 miles away. He wanted us to look up in the sky southeast. There were three lighted objects, rotating and changing in color. They were in a straight line formation, diagnal. Video footage shows them in a nearly triangular shape. We spotted them -- watched for almost a minute and one by one they disappeared.  Weather forecast reported clear skies!  Objects were chaning color, moving quickly in a straight line across the sky. Reportedly from the west to the east. Colors ranged from green, orange, red, white and yellow-ish. Last light seen seemed to leave a trail of orange sparks behind it. It was not an airplane. Flying too low and too close to each other. Def. not an airplane becuase of the space between each object and the formations in which the objects evolved. Watched hours of UFO youtube footage and have been able to identify similar objects in ohter videos, including footage from Illinois area in the last month. ABSOLUTELY AMAZING SIGHT!!!

94W near 103rd at 5:30PM.;2016-10-24 17:30:00;10 seconds;94W near 103rd at 5:30PM I was coming past 103rd exit on 94W.  I hung up the phone and saw what appearedto be a blimp.  The sunlight reflection made it difficult to see clearly.  It was too big and odd shaped to be an airplane.  It appeared to have two antennaes or it could have been the way it was shaped.  I dropped my phone and when I reached to take a picture of it it was gone.  I am searching online to see if anyone else saw it and I found this site.
