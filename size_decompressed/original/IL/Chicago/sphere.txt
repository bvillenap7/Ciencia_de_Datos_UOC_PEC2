SOCCER-SIZED CRYTAL-LIKE SPIKED BALL, Easily Missed If One Is Not Looking Directly At It.;1986-04-01 14:30:00;10 seconds;SOCCER-SIZED CRYTAL-LIKE SPIKED BALL, Easily Missed If One Is Not Looking Directly At It. Soccer-ball-sized craft that I could see thru much like a dandelion flower seeds just before you blow them.  It was made like a lot of spikes in two heights, though, and if I had not been looking in that exact spot at that exact time, I would never have seen it.  It was outside the window that overlooks the space between our building and the next, a width of about 5 feet betweein the two buildings.  The day was overcast but it was light outside.  No country, or group of countries could have made this object.  I heard it make no sound but, then, it was outside the window, and it appears to use the air as a stepping stone and it glided toward the window as I happened to look that direction.  It stopped, pivoted once, paused, pivoted again, and left quickly in the direction from which it came.  The best way I can describe seeing it is like seeing Predator, wherein one can look directly at it and not see it unless it moves.  And if you are looking a few feet to the side of it, one would not see it probably.  It was too small to have occupants since it was about 10 to 12 inches in diameter and a portion of that diameter seemed to be made of spikes, but you can see thru it.  It moved with purpose, though, and could not have been some eye phenomenon because I saw it pivot twice.  I only saw it once, and have never heard of anyone quite describe what I saw, or at least I do not know of anyone whose description matches mine.  I did see a fairly similar depiction of my craft, but is was all black in the book, and there was no additional informaton.  I think a good description of the basic shape is that of certain pollen when viewed with an electron microscope, but that would be shape only.  The color is like a crystal that reflects the colors of the overcast sky at daytime.  It did not emit lights or beams, left no trail, and did not land or make any sound.  There were no lights on the object, no aura or haze around it.  It did not change colors any more than a series of crystals would.  There was no aircraft in its vicinity, and it had no noticeable affect on any equipment in my livingroom where I was when I saw it.  I do not have pictures of it.  My sense is that it was a probe of some sort, gathering information of some sort, and it may have taken a picture perhaps on the first pivot.  Who knows?  It is just a guess...

In a one hour period during a blackout, I witnessed 6 bright green spheres, flying across the sky from South-East to North-West.;1998-11-10 00:00:00;about an hour;In a one hour period during a blackout, I witnessed 6 bright green spheres, flying across the sky from South-East to North-West. On the night of November 10th, parts of the Chicago area had no power, do to a wind storm. The residential power on my block was out, but the street lights were still functioning. I had opened up my blinds in order to let in some of this light. With the power out, I became very bored, and called up my friend to chat (my phone was still functioning). While I talked to her, I was casually studying the sky outside my window. It was then that I noticed a green glowing ball in the sky. I informed my friend, and she causually brushed it off. I, in turn, became intrigued. Within the next hour, I saw five more of these objects. They appeared in the South-East part of the sky, and traveled soundlessly to the North-West, where they dissappeared out of my view. They flew at what appeared to be the same altitude as the planes that usually fly in the area, though, curiously, I can't recall any planes in the area at the time. I know that the objects weren't planes. I live realitively near O'Hare airport, and have literaly hundreds of planes fly over me every year. I know what they look like, and sound like, and these objects were denfinatly not them. These objects were sphereical and neon green. They looked a bit like comets without tails. At this point, I have no idea what I saw on that night. My friend (the one I was on the phone with) has spent a great deal of time trying to convince me to drop the subject, saying that it was probably something very normal. I then pointed out to her that green flying balls are *not* normal. I want to know what was in the sky that night, flying over my head. I hope that reporting it can help me solve this mystery.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
glass sphere tracking plane en route to Chicago Airport - April 2000;2000-04-01 17:50:00;20-30 seconds;glass sphere tracking plane en route to Chicago Airport - April 2000 I was on a flight from Raleigh/Durham, NC to Chicago.  I was seated on the right side of the plane in the exit row over the wing. As the plane made its' final approach, the sun was setting in the western sky, and it seemed we were in a low level flight path (say 6,000-10,000') for a period of 10 or 15 minutes (perhaps a holding plan).  During this time, I observed what appeared to be a glass ball only 100-150 ft off the right side of the plane.  The object appeared to be maybe 8' in diameter.  The sunset was shining on the object and was somewhat reflected in the object, such that the round shape of the object was clearly identified. The object was moving in the same direction as the plane, but just slightly slower and slightly lower in elevations such that I initially saw the object ahead of the plane, then watched as the plane slowly passed the object.  I witnessed the object be hidden by the wing as the plane passed, then appeared again behind the wing.  I continued to observe the object until i could no longer see the object from the window as the plane continued to pull ahead.  After witnessing the object, i stood up to see if anyone else in the plane was glued to the window, pointed, talking about it,etc.  I didn't see anybody else that appeared to have seen the object.  The plane landed.  On the way off the plane, I stopped at the door and asked the flight attendants if I could speak with the pilots (cockpit door closed), but was told no.  I asked if they had seen anything and they stated not. I waited in the terminal for the pilots, but they never appeared from the plane/gate.  Have others seemed similar objects.  It was awesome and I would love to hear of similar experiences to corroborate my own. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Sphere seen from atop a high rise building;2001-07-01 11:00:00;5 seconds;Sphere seen from atop a high rise building I must say that I always scoffed at those who claimed to have seen UFO's. Nevertheless, my former asiistant and myself, were 500 feet in the air on the rooftop of a 50 story high rise where I have been employed in building maintenance for 22 years. This was in the heart of downtown Chicago. We were checking out the chemtrails left by some tankers that were spraying the area on that morning, ( another story entirely) when we simultaneously noticed a mettalic looking round ball sitting to the left of a very small cloud about 300 feet above us, but out over lake Michigan. We were inland about two city blocks from the lakefront, and I estimate the object to have been at the lakes edge, or directly above Lakeshore drive. As we pointed towards it, the object slowly moved behind a very small cloud, the only cloud around, and then appeared to go straight up. This was only about a 5 to 10 second viewing, and once it was behind the cloud, it's upward motion which we detected for only a second, yeilded to a complete absense of the object. Nothing speedy about it, it just appeared to briefly go upward behind this very small cloud, and then disappeared.  We were both sober, and both kind of feeling funny about the viewing. We joked that we had better not tell anyone, but of course we did. It was forgotten about over time as it was really not that much of a sighting. Very bland and very brief. I would have never reported it if I hadn't come across the opportunity to do so here.  In summary, we were 500 feet in the air and observed this metallic colored round ball. When we pointed to it and gazed at it, it moved behind a small cloud as if to hide itself from our view. We stayed on the roof another 10 minutes or so and it never re-appeared. Boring perhaps, but quite true. I'm not saying what it was, or was not. I dont know one way or the other. Also, the object was totally silent.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

Brief sighting of globular object at extremely high altitude and speed entering and then leaving atmosphere.;2006-05-07 18:17:00;less than 1 min;Brief sighting of globular object at extremely high altitude and speed entering and then leaving atmosphere. Object was viewed at an extremely high altitude traveling at an incredible rate of speed, much like the speed of the space shuttle when viewed flying on approach as it enters the atmosphere. It appeared in my view directly overhead at 12:00 o'clock position and continued East Souteast in a straight line and then appeared to leave the atmosphere and I lost sight at that moment. It was difficult to view precisely the objects shape but it appeared somewhat globular. Briefly after viewing the UFO, another aircraft of recognizable shape appeared in the same area at an oblique angle of interception, heading East Northeast. That's all I saw.

Glowing amber orb flying through sky at night;2008-06-21 01:00:00;30 minutes;Glowing amber orb flying through sky at night Last night at about 1 am saturday morning the 21st of June, in Chicago, IL. 60634, me and my friend were out on my deck when we saw a amber orange glowing orb traveling north-east. There was no sound coming from it as it flew by overhead at maybe the altitude of where the clouds would be. We kept watching it till it disappeared in the horizon and houses. It then appeared a half hour later (or maybe it was a different one) midway through the sky and flew in a easterly direction.

12 spheres spotted over NW Side of Chicago-light colored. Traveled NE.;2009-03-14 15:00:00;20 minutes;12 spheres spotted over NW Side of Chicago-light colored. Traveled NE. I am reporting a UFO sighting that my fiance and I saw while driving to a restaurant on Chicago's NW side (not too far from O'Hare airport). I saw a few light colored spheres in the sky above an airplane and my fiance confirmed it was there. I pulled over on Oak Park Avenue and took her camera to grab some photos. She counted 12 of these spheres, which seemed to be very high up. I was so busy trying to get her point and shoot Lumix camera to focus that I really didn't pay attention to any other detail about these things. I don't know if they all moved in unison or if they were all moving individually. They were traveling North East. My fiance says they may be balloons, so I checked the weather. The wind was blowing southwest at the time. Also, these wouldn't be planes because they were not only too high up but, I really don't think that many planes would be at the same altitude traveling North East (to Canada?). I called 311 (information) to make a report, and they transferred me to the Police. I was sort of embarrased so I asked them to just let the military know what I saw. The spheres eventually dissapeared into the distance and could no longer make out where they were. I have 1 photo of the luckily zoomed in capture of only a few of the spheres which I circled on photoshop with a pen. The camera had an auto focus which, unfortunately, couldn't find the things in the sky to focus on. So, out of the 10 or so pictures I took most were all blurry. I do have 1 picture or two that you can make out these things. I'd be willing to share the photos with someone who'd be able to help identify the objects. If you have any questions, feel free to reply to this email. If you can find anything about similar sighting of these, please let me know.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
Pulsating sphere changing in size.;2009-08-19 23:30:00;1:00;Pulsating sphere changing in size. I was outside in my backyard looking at the sky. It was after 11:30 at night and pretty much a clear sky.  I saw what looked like a very bright star in the NE . To the naked eye, it was brighter then the other stars around. I had binoculars which I used. I saw a sphere like object that was primarily red with white and green and some blue.It almost looked like a firework that went off but a much smaller effect. It also was pulsating.Did not really move a great distance but twitched. It would change from the sphere to the bright point. I called for my husband to take a look. He was not sure either what it was. My husband took a picture of the object next to a light. Two red lights can be seen along with steak of white light.  We live near O'Hare flight path but most of the flights had stopped by that time. We have lived in the area for 22 years.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

A Pitch black sphere slowly hovered, moving in a south-eastern direction.  There was a distortion effect around it.  Like a haze or something blocking the human eye from seeing more of it.  I didn't have a camera on me but it looked like the footage i have seen of the phoenix lights during the day when they appear to be black spheres...this sighting was in full daylight.  I tracked it while on the phone with my brother until it was out of sight.  The Sphere was close enough to me that I could easily see that it was NOT any sort of aircraft at ALL. NO sound, NO lights, NO markings.  Just a black floating sphere.  There was no way to truly know its size but my educated guess would be between the size of a minivan and possibly even larger.  Maybe the size of a house.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
Strange Craft Descends from Sky in Chicago and exits the night sky rapidly to the North East;2010-08-26 21:00:00;1 min;Strange Craft Descends from Sky in Chicago and exits the night sky rapidly to the North East On 8/26/2010 at 9:03pm CST I witnessed a UFO through my deck sliding glass doorway. I was looking out the window in a north east direction and contemplating taking my telescope out to view the night sky as the moon was very bright in the eastern sky low above the trees. I was looking at the constellation Cassiopeia when there was a bright star that began to descend from the constellation. As it descend it got brighter and very large then began to move in a north eastern direction rapidly.  The total experience was less than 1 minute. Background: I often lay on my couch watching television and look out a 6’wide by 10’ high sliding glass patio doorway.  When looking out the sliding glass doors I am facing in a north eastern direction.  My wife and I live somewhat near the O’Hare Airport and are in the direct line of incoming and outgoing air traffic.  So, I am very familiar with aircraft and their appearance both in daylight and dark night skies.  I have seen aircraft flying low and high and feel I can tell the difference between aircraft and what I saw on 8/26/2010 at 9:03pm. 9:03pm 8/26/2010: I had spent the evening noticing how the sky was clear and how the moon was very bright and low in the eastern sky. At approximately 8:50pm CST I noticed a bright star below the moon and wondered if it was a planet.  I took a walk back into a spare room where I keep my 10” Orion Dobsonian Telescope. But as it was going to be too much trouble to take it out of the storage closet I decided against it.  I walked back to the living room and lay upon the couch and was looking at the constellation Cassiopeia and noticed that from out of view above the sliding glass door a star was getting brighter and looked as though it was descending directly from the constellation. Over the next few second the star got very large, bright white and began to slow its descent. At this point I called for my wife in our bedroom reading a book to please look out the window, as the bedroom window are on the same north eastern facing wall.  She said she could not see a thing, as I assumed she had alrea! dy closed the drapes as she always does. As this conversation was happening the object had gotten very large and stopped descending. It was at a magnitude I have never witnessed before.  My wife did come out of the room and asked what I wanted her to see, as my request was unusual and I was shocked at what was happening and I think she could hear that in my voice.  I continued to observe the object and it got suddenly got very bright and moved in a north easterly direction rapidly.   When she joined me at the sliding glass door, I pointed out the object and she said “you mean that star”.  When my wife said “you mean that star”, the object had already become about an 15th of its largest size and had moved out and away from us. It moved rapidly and then disappeared into the sky in that same direction.  She said it probably was plane, but she had not witnessed the full event. Conclusion: In the two years I have been living here and observing the night sky and passage of commercial planes I have never witnessed anything like this before.  The object I saw was round and moved like nothing I had ever seen before.  It descended rapidly from what appeared to be a small star to a large round object. It hovered for a second before rapidly moving out of sight.  There were no blinking lights on the object like on the commercial craft that fly overhead constantly.  And as this was a clear night I am an amateur astronomer I cannot identify what it was that I witnessed. My only conclusion would be to say that this was an UFO.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
seen one metalic orb then seen 15-20 orbs;2011-08-27 14:30:00;hour and half;seen one metalic orb then seen 15-20 orbs Around two thirty in the afternoon I was sitting on my deck reading a book.  I looked up into the eastern sky and I seen a metallic orb traveling south. I had a pair of binoculars with me and took a look.  What I saw was a round metallic orb moving slowly towards the south. I kept looking at it through the binoculars until I lost sight of it.  My girlfriend happen to come out at that time and also seen it. We weren’t sure if it was a balloon. I continued to read my book when ten minutes later I saw another orb from the east traveling towards the south again.  I grabbed my binoculars and observed it.  What I saw was the exact same thing I saw the first time. It was a shiny metallic orb moving slowly towards the south.  I observed it again until I lost sight of it. I was getting excited so I just began to scan the sky. Ten to fifteen minutes later another orb appeared from no where in the eastern sky and traveled south. It followed the exact same route as the first two.  I followed this one with the binoculars as well but what I seen next I will never forget.  What I saw was 15-20 metallic orbs stationed in the southern skies.  I thought I saw a couple of black orbs as well.  They all held their position and resembled star constellations only this was in broad daylight.  My girlfriend was present at the time and seen them with the naked eye and did not need binoculars.  It was an incredible sight and I watched them until I lost sight of them. After that incredible event I was watching the eastern sky looking for another orb.  Maybe twenty minutes later I saw one final orb traveling the same route as the other three from east to south.  My girlfriend and I will never forget this day.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

Unidentified flying object spotted in Chicago this morning.;2015-01-14 02:55:00;0.05;Unidentified flying object spotted in Chicago this morning. I woke up late last night having fallen asleep on my couch while watching a movie.  I awoke to the sound of my television and then turned it off while still lying on my couch.  I sat there for a few minutes and darkness looking at my view of the Chicago skyline when a bright light caught my eye.   My condominium is the flightpath of O'Hare airport and I've grown use to watching planes fly past my balcony on approach to O'Hare airport.  I am also fairly close to the city's medical district and will occasionally see emergency response helicopters fly by my window as well.  However, I've become very adept at identifying types of planes, their altitudes, and the speed in which they are flying.  As the son of a military and commercial pilot, I've spent more than 45 years around airplanes.   This object was flying far too low and moved more fluidly then any aircraft I've seen as it made an ark across the sky.  Its lights flickered brightly, making and arcing tracer as it dissipated in the same manner as a signal flare.   I walked over to my window looking for signs of a tail light and nothing was there.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
Police, FBI, & Military Cordon Off Areas of Downtown Chicago Durring Mass Sighting As Military Aircrafts Chase UFOs Overhead.;2015-09-17 21:06:00;3-6 hours;Police, FBI, & Military Cordon Off Areas of Downtown Chicago Durring Mass Sighting As Military Aircrafts Chase UFOs Overhead. This was a mass sighting in downtown Chicago of all places. It went viral on Facebook almost immediately.  Some crafts were seen flying close to the ground in downtown Chicago. Pictures were taken and possibly video as well.  What makes this especially unique is that parts of Chicago were cordoned off with roadblocks/traffic diversions.  The police, FBI, and military were there coordinating efforts as these objects were chased by planes and helicopters around the sky.  The areas initially involved also became permeated with men in black suits who were seen talking to the feds and were walking around everywhere. Then the police decided to tell everyone that it was just lightening which nobody could possibly believe.  Thousands of people on Facebook took to massive threads.  Some of the pictures posted disappeared from FB but some were saved by others (Some of which are friends of mine) before hand.  I don't know if this was on local news but it should have been.  The local police/feds/military response was unprecedented.  This is not a hoax. I believe the objects were orb-like.  The pics I saw were of three lights in a triangular shape, though I could not determine if they were a result of one craft or three.  I would have to go back and sift through a massive amount of posts to get more details on the craft(s) and will do so if contacted.  Please only release my first name. ((NUFORC Note:  This is a second-hand report from a person who learned of the alleged event from friends in Chicago.

I am ex Navy and stationed on the USS;2016-08-20 23:00:00;30 minutes;My wife and I were in Chicago and we witnessed 8 orange/red/bright spheres slowly going overhead.  I am ex Navy and stationed on the USS Midway back in te mid 80's.  I worked on the flight deck identifying aircraft so they could set the arresting gear for the correct plane landing (I know my aircraft) - you use the color and shape of the pylons on the aircraft to identify it.  This was way slower and way lower than a regular plane would fly. It was much smaller too.  Perhaps 800 - 100 ft up and maybe 20' - 25' long.  Listen, they were on a flight pattern almost right above, not in complete uniform but close.  The 3rd or 4th one was right overhead in fact my wife grabbed my arm as I joked that if these are real UFO's one might beam me up and she was deathly afraid that it might. I got to see inside it pretty well.  It looked to me like the outside was opaque (see thru) down the middle inside was a dark (spine or pencil) running the length of it.  Imagine the top 3rd of a Christmas tree looked like the propulsion as it was glowing, mainly orange, red. It looked like it was on file but a controlled fire that never got out of control.  Heck, I did a lot of research and many say it's those Chinese lanterns.  No, waaaay to big and at the end. First 3 or 4 came, than the other 4 about 5 -7 minutes later.  There was also the 9th UFO? that stayed out a distance that never came to close to recognize the color or shape.  You see, I like fairly close to O'Hare and the flight pattern is pretty similar location and we were seeing lights and after a while they would get closer and you could make them out but the 9th UFO? never got too close or on the flight pattern of the regular aircraft. It was close, I mean close enough and closer than the videos I see on you tube for me to see inside and make it out really well.  Funny thing was it was a rather calming experience.  I mean if you were to tell me that I would see a UFO I would normally be afraid and here I was looking at what I think were UFO's and I wasn't scared.  Like I said I went underneath and said go ahead and beam me up!  I just never felt that it was threat to us. I believe it was unmanned?  Not sure if unmanned is right word there?  Anyway, I believe it was just gathering information. ((ADDENDUM FROM SOURCE OF REPORT)) Hi Peter, Not many clouds in the sky as it was pretty clear on 8/20/16 in Chicago. The altitude of the few clouds were at least twice that of the ufo's. I don't know how to triangulate altitude but I do know from just checking google images of pictures from 1000' altitude that that is really close to the height (perhaps less and 800' is probably closer). Our location seeing this was Hermosa Park. If you do a quick google or view of the park we were in the field between the baseball field and the playground. The formation came from the baseball field to the playground which is from West to East (Lake Michigan is due East). I just wish like a computer my memory from this event could be accessed so you could see what I saw.. I did some research after seeing this (after checking to see if I could find other reports about this particular incident) and found this to be the closest thing to what I saw - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc2ppoJIexY. The only difference was my vantage point. We were probably 3 times closer than his view, right underneath the flight pattern. Crazy thing to me was after researching the internet was seeing so many reports of similar sightings. I would've just brushed these people away myself before this happened as I'm a see it to believe it kind of person but I can tell you I'm a believer now! I really not sure how to contact the local press about something like this but myself or my wife are not afraid to say what we saw. We are very straightforward people with no agenda so if I'm contacted I will talk but I'm probably not going to seek out any press myself. I'm willing to continue any dialog about this Peter, as I'm still so curious as to what this was?!  Let me know any thoughts or if you have a similar report from others.  This happened in Chicago on a Saturday night in the summer in a busy area!!!  Someone saw something that we did I can tell you that. Sincerely, ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM));41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

Somewhere between Clyborn street and Webster where less buildings were the best to my recolection is where I noticed this object in the sky.  I was looking up towards the West sky noticed how thickly covered in clouds it was then that moment there was a parting of the clouds and I saw a shpere.  It was gray with a glow almost luner like, did not do anything but just stay there for that brief moment and the clouds covered it up again.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

Going from South to North over Chicago two bright red tennis objects slowly floated over my house.  On a very clear night with little clouds they were very clear.  They had no noise and were fairly low.  Not blurry they were very clear.   A minute later another single white object followed the other two now not visible going South over Chicago.  They were clearly flying lower then the planes landing at O'Hare airport.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

We were Over Lake Michigan at approximately 1k feet and I saw what I thought was a white bird Like a seagull flying above the water going in the opposite direction as the plane. As it got closer I noticed that it was not a bird but rather a white ball shaped object flying at a steady rate. There were no propellers or any type of exhaust or thrust producing mechanisms. It just moved under the plane at a steady rate. It’s difficult to determine an exact size because it was below me and appeared by be ~ 20 fee above the water. If I Were to guess I would say 2-3 ft. in diameter. I have never see a UFO in my life, I’m not sure what this was but it was very strange. No one else on the plane made a comment that I could hear.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
