I perchanced to see a fluorescent green fire fireball, about the size of a dime at arm's length.  Trailing it was an orange-white tail.  Sighting lasted 2-3 seconds.  Sky clear, with clouds moving in from the north.  Sighting occured in clear skies. The object ( fireball ) was the size of a dime held at arm's length and of a fluorescent green color, trailed by an orange-white tail. Object descended in graceful arch ( approx. 45 degree angle ) across the nne skies.  There was no noise at all.  Note: I am familiar with fireworks, and assure you this was not a firework by any stretch of the imagination.  There were no other witnesses;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

Usually a fireworks display rocket is travelling upwards away from sight, but this was verry bright and appeared to be like something was on fire, so bright that it was difficult to tell if it was high in the night sky or low.  It was travelling fast notheast untill it distinguised and was lost in sight.  It also lest a trail of light as it was travelling in a horizontal path, and the light caused a bright line.  My wife and children all witnessed it.  My wife also thought it was some kind of aircraft on fire or so.  I called the police department and they told me no one had reported anything.  I also called Midway Airport and they also had not noticed anything in the sky.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

Green fireball followed by tail of red going northeast across sky;1999-11-16 19:15:00;30 seconds;Green fireball followed by tail of red going northeast across sky I am a manager for a well-known corporation.  I was traveling in the Chicago area and looking for my hotel around 7PM EST. I had just turned onto a side road in the Downers Grove/Oak Brook area that runs east along the main expressway into Chicago.  Further east toward the Chicago skyline and in the center of the sky I saw what looked like a bright green fireball following by a trail of red.  There seemed to be several red balls in the tail.  The bright green object was at least 1/3 of the total length of the object.  The objects moved together train-like and didn't seem to change distance.  It moved northeast across the sky.  I pulled off the road and watched for about 15 seconds before it disappeared to the north of the Chicago skyline. Earlier that day, I had seen a plane pulling a banner around Chicago.  Thinking about it, I wondered if perhaps it wasn't the same plane lit up at night.  A week or two later, I mentioned it to somebody else who said they had heard a similar story on the news.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

I saw a big light that lite up the corner intersection, and part of our street.  Then we both saw a fire ball low in the sky, horizontally racing east.  This fire ball was maybe 7 stories high.  I called the police because we are on the flight path of Ohare airport and I thought a plane part fell or a plane when down.  When 911 answered the phone, they asked where would it land.  I said it had to be close because it was so low but it wasn't coming down in a vertical descent.  It was confusing.  I asked if there were any other 911 calls and they said no.  There wasn't any reports of things crashing to the earth.  The fire ball was maybe 8 feet across.  This was years, maybe 2, before the Ohare reports and I didn't know what to make of it.  Only after the Ohare reported sightings did I rethink this. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

I pulled over to the side because what we saw seemed like three pretty large comets falling from the sky (not really lined up). It was about SE far from downtown. Another car pulled over to see what we saw, so we were not the only ones who witnessed this.  There was an airplane flying what seemed past these figures so we wondered if they were burning debri or something of that sort. We were convinced that they were ufo's when two of the three started slowing down and at this time they look like balls of light moving around then side to side until they stopped right next to each other and stood still for one second. Then, all three started slowly moving down, once again with their tail of fire, now moving side to side as they were heading downward. They were disappearing and reappearing until they dissapeared behind the buildings. At this time, my mother and I noticed several airplanes flying about. I wondered if maybe we were not the only ones who witnessed this. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

The object made no sound and was observed by 2 people.   It seemed characteristic of a meteor, except that it appeared MUCH larger than any previously seen by the observer.

Brilliant multi-colored light hanging in the east-southest sky for over half an hour.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus.  PD));2007-11-27 22:00:00;15-30 min +;Brilliant multi-colored light hanging in the east-southest sky for over half an hour I can't say that this is a true UFO as it remained stationary in the sky for the entire time of the sighting and never seemed to fly anywhere.  It looks like a star, which is the obvious answer, but when observed through high powered binoculars, the object quickly and constantly changes color from green to red to yellow to white.  It is far more vivid than a typical twinkling star, especially considering that I can see it through the light pollution of the city (Chicago).  I am 100% certain that it is NOT an airplane as it has remained in the same spot in the sky for several minutes.  I just went out and checked again and it is still there some thirty minutes after I first saw it.  It is in the eastern sky, slightly to the SE, directly below the belt of the constellation Orion.  It is perhaps one third the way up the horizon.  If it is a star, it is doing some very strange things.  A slight tail can be seen pointing to the left.  I was alerted to this by my father who lives in central Michigan.  He called to tell me about his sighting. He thought it was the comet Holmes and called me.  It is in the wrong part of the sky to be said comet and far too brilliant, as the comet is now barely visible to the naked eye. ((NUFORC Note:  Venus.  PD));41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

Visibility was good with high cirrus clouds. From our vantage point, we could see the flight pattern of planes on their final approach to O'Hare Airport (about 10 miles due west of us).  The planes were coming in low, at approximately 2000 feet, at 1:30 min. intervals.  The fireball was clearly well below the cloud ceiling, roughly at the same altitude as the approaching aircraft.  The fireball had a long blue-green streak trailing behind it as it dissipated in the SE sky toward Lake Michigan.  We also noticed the flight pattern of the planes seemed to change after our observance. Tom Skilling, weatherman at WGN TV, also reported during his 9:30pm weather segment, that there were several calls to the station reporting similar sightings. He was going to follow up... no news reports in the mainstream media as of yet.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
August 23, 2009 Seven Chicago Witnesses view strange Orange Red balls of light in night sky.;2009-08-23 21:30:00;1 hour;August 23, 2009 Seven Chicago Witnesses view strange Orange Red balls of light in night sky. On August 23, 2009 at about 930p seven eye witnesses watched two orange balls of light slowly appear from the sky then slowly disappear. Their pattern of flight began from the South East and moved North West over Chicago. It was a very clear summer night many stars and different easily identified aircraft could be seen. The two balls of red/orange light appeared then disappeared. I could see as one elevated very high in the sky then resembled a star that began streaking West. About 5 mins later a line of orange/red lights then began to appear and slowly move into a triangle formation. Each light then slowly faded out. After the lights disappeared a variety of terrestrial craft small planes, jets, helicopters began to move into the area above NW Chicago where the lights had been. After about a half hour a large red and green triangle solid object began to make schedule circles around the NW side of the City in the sky possibly over Lake Michigan. All of this ! was witnessed by seven different adults and none had an explaining for what was seen. They were not meteors because they were transfixed at times and moved in others. They were not Chinese lanterns because they came down from the atmosphere then projected back up. I tried to capture to image on my Cell phone video camera but the phone camera was not adequate to film something with such low light. I did manage to catch a small amount. My friend then did get her camera and managed to take some video and photos of what we were witnessing. In my video (the bad one) you can faintly see the triangle formation it made but also listen to the peoples reaction of it. In my friends video you can see the objects in the sky and here the same reaction. Here is my friends link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aYx1IiTc68 and my link is http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=334Yh9r09K0 both videos and sound are from the same occurrence (date/time).

Three of my friends and myself that were witness to the encounter work in the aerospace industry and have never seen anything like it before. The ages of the witnesses are from 25 to 55.

I am delaying this report because I am lazy and have been really busy lately. At approx. 22:30 hours, I was over at my friend's house in Mount Greenwood/Chicago celebrating the fourth of July.  My girlfriend, brother, friend and friends sister were in his pool in the backyard making a whirl pool when one of us, I don't remember who said WHATS THAT?!   We all stopped and looked EAST into the sky.  A ROUND almost flickering object (reddish/orange) was traveling from SOUTH TO NORTH across the sky.  I asked my friends girlfriend to quickly grab my glasses (because I was in the pool still).  My friend yelled for his two parents to come outside. We all watchedas the object just moved rather slowly across the sky...from south to north.... I have been interested in UFO's/flying saucer phenomenon for quite sometime now, but never dreamed of actually being a witness. I payed close attention to this object....trying to listen for any noise or seeing any airplane lights, i.e. green, red, etc.  I could hear nothing. Now in a matter of seconds the object seemed to head Northeast away from our location. There were no fireworks in the sky at the moment so I ruled out that.  Did not appear to be a helicopter or airplane....the damn thing looked like it was on fire!   I thought it could be a military jet....but its lack of speed/being a weird bright flashy red / orange.....I COULD NOT EXPLAIN IT!  Hopefully someone else has seen it. My friend said later in the evening it appeared again and flew over his house. Scares the crap out of me! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

I was standing on the Belmont EL platform in chicago on my cellphone and I turned just in time to see a huge fire ball moving TOO SLOWLY across the sky.  I instantly posted to my facebook asking if anyome else happened to see it and infact so far 2 people have reported seeing it.  It was about 6 average stars width in diameter.  It was descending at about a 30 deg angle heading what looked like due north and sank behind the rooftops and I lost sight of it.   One of my friends who replied to my status update said they were walking along the beach and their bf saw it but she did not. I am not discounting a meteor but it was moving very slowly and had golden fire emiting from it evenly in all directions and had a tail that looked more like a rocket flame than a normal meteor.  It should be noted I have seen a meteor crash to earth before (within 1000 feet...i know pretty cool right?) and this just struck me as odd. oddities.... the flames were omnidirectional coming out of the object...not burning off to the back like something burning up as it travels through the atmosphere. it had a vibrant gold color to it...flames...ball...tail...everything was gold  it was moving entirely too slowly. it all happened within about 2-3 seconds but it etched itself into my mind. a minute later as i got on my train i saw a police chopper flying by the beaches doing their patrol but who knows what that could have been because they are often there.

I see a bright green ball of light through the window facing North.  It was moving similar to how I would describe a falling star, almost a perfect 45 degree angle - downward.  I saw it for about 3-4 seconds and then it disappeared in the on the horizon (buildings/Lake Michigan, depending on the depth).   I've subsequently watched scores of airplains fly by and none are anything like the green ball I saw.  Did anyone else see this?

This was NOT a firework.;2015-07-04 20:55:00;Not sure;This was NOT a firework. Me and my friends were popping fireworks.  We do often joke that we are contacting UFO's with the lights.  My friend was recording, when a fiery reddish-orange light went floating by. we tried to dismiss it as a flare, but it was in the air way to long, and it moved a large distance.   We then said maybe it was a plane.  But a plane flew exactly next to it.  It could have been a plane, especially by comparison.   My friends dismissed it still, but, i was still bothered by it.  I think i have proof, but i haven't reviewed the video yet.  So i would prefer to get back to you. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, who corrected the time.  The sighting occurred during the evening.  PD));41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
Possible ufo encounter.;2015-07-04 22:00:00;5 minutes;Possible ufo encounter. Celebrating 4th of july we have spoted orange lights above sky line of Chicago right above fire works.  We were joking that there were helicopters and the pilots are not very smart flyling  between fireforks.  Then I have spotted 2 orange lights flighing in formation and disapperaring alwaysg in the same place (possibly because of smoke from fireworks).  Then it hit me that chicago was No Fly Zone by FAA on July 4th. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

It moved over the city and picked up heading southwest on the opposite side of my building from where I first saw it.  It was an orange glow so not like plane lights.  Lost it in the clouds so it had to increase elevation. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

I went out, and after a few minutes of waiting, I observed one myself.  It was moving rapidly to the West, and died out slowly.  We were not able to tell where it went though, as we would of tried to find it.  They were assumed to be Chinese lights, but they can't be.  They were moving too fast and specific to be them.  There was also no wind.  Also the fact they were always the same height from the ground and all moved at the speed.  They would come from the same place, and move down the same street.
