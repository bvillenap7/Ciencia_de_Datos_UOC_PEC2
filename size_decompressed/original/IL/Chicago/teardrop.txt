a teardrop or fireball shaped object that hung in the sky the object showed up on a long-exposure photograph.;2003-06-20 21:53:00;At least two minutes;a teardrop or fireball shaped object that hung in the sky the object showed up on a long-exposure photograph. I was on my roof taking long exposure photographs of the city, facing east.  I didn't see the object in the sky at the time, but when I looked at the photos afterwards there was a curious, bright shape in the sky, shaped I suppose like a teardrop.  Using a long exposure soaks up whatever light is in the sky, even stuff you don't see with the naked eye.  For example, keeping the shutter open for ten seconds over a solid blue sky could reveal distinct, clear clouds once the photograph is developed (or you view the digital photos, such as mine).  The object was definitely stationary because otherwise it would have been streaked.  It wasn't a reflection or something stuck on the lens because it would have shown up in other pictures.  Also, as the position of the camera changed, the object remained in the same place.  There's a small, very faint, circle of light surrounding it.  So there's no question that it was something in the sky and not a glitch with the camera.  I guess it's a UFO in the literal sense of the word: it's an object, it's in the sky, and heck if I can identify it!;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

Thanksgiving -  spade shaped object with 10-15 red lights below the cloud overcast and above the tree line.;2009-11-26 20:00:00;10 Seconds;Thanksgiving -  spade shaped object with 10-15 red lights below the cloud overcast and above the tree line. I had just walked into my family's living room for thanksgiving.  After saying hello to everyone I sat down on the couch and looked out the window.  It was an overcast sky so the object I saw was definitely not a plane because it would have been too low.  The object looked like a teardrop shape, almost a spade shape, made up completely of red lights (Probably a good 10-15 red lights around the edge and in the center, symmetrical though.)  It seemed rather large.  It was below the clouds but above the tree line and houses.  The lights did not blink or flash or move formation.  The object hovered there for a second then slowly began descending.  As I was about to get everyone's attention to look outside because I thought I was losing my mind, the craft slowly disappeared behind the tree line and houses.
