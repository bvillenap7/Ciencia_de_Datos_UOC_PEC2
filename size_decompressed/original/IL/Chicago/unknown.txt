Three single file white lights, moving in unison, south to north, making no sound.;1997-07-27 00:00:00;10 seconds;Three single file white lights, moving in unison, south to north, making no sound. I was up on my roof after a days work.  I live in the heart of the city, about 2 miles from the lakefront and the city skyline.  The urban light blocks out most of the stars and anything else in the sky.  I have seen some satellites from the city, so I am familiar with how they look.  As I was watching the sky that night, I noticed three moving lights.  They weren't very bright and where all white, so they weren't a usual plane using O'Hare or Midway.  The lights were in a single-file line equidistant from each other, and when they moved, they moved in formation.  I had the impression they were connected.    I also heard no sound from them as they crossed.  They moved faster than any satellite I have seen and I had the impression that they were much lower than a satellite.  The lights moved from south to north.  They only took about ten seconds at the most to move out of sight, and I have watched satellites from the city for at least five minutes before I lost sight of them. I have always been interested in UFO's since I was a kid, but this is the first time I have seen something in the sky that I can not identify based on circumstances.  I am a pretty good sceptic, I don't believe in the existence of something but I also don't believe in the non-existence of something unless I have the proof of either in front of me.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

There were very bright lights around the bottom and a large bright light at the top. The object was moving very slowly across my vantage point. I could see the object on the top of the trees, it had to be about 2 to 3 miles away from me. The lights were as bright as the shopping center lights. A row of lights were at the bottom and one or maybe more than one at the top. I pulled over to the side of the road to put on a better pair of glasses and fish my camera out of my prurse. When I looked back up, it was gone. I am an artist and I would be willing to draw a picture of what I saw. I have a Masters in Writing. I consider my self to be level-headed. Frankly, I don't know what I saw. But I know this...it was not a plane or helicopter it was just too big. I have lived near OHare airport for the past 20 years. I know planes.

When it moved, it was slow and steady, stopping on occasion. Almost as if it was scoping out an area. It was about 2:15- 2:30  am on Wednesday morning I was driving west on Webster ave in the Bucktown area. While waiting at the stoplight at Damen ave, I was looking ahead and noticed something in the sky that was hovering and very brightly lit up. I thought that it seemed a little strange that it was not moving at all. When the light turned green I moved ahead crossing over Damen ave and all the time looking up and to the left to try to figure out what it was. When I got directly by it (and this thing was not that high up at all) I became so excited that I stopped in the middle of the street and got out of my car because I thought that if it were a helicopter there must be some noise happening. But when i got out of the car, I looked directly at it and there was absolutely no noise at all! I was so excited that I tried desperatly to get a good look at it but it was so dark that all I could see were at least three lights, two yellowish white and one bluish white. It started to move to the east and i followed it with my eyes until it started to slowly move to the north and then behind the church going nw. I jumped in the car determined to follow it but as it moved off I lost view of it. The thing that was weird was there was no noise, the way that it hovered and moved and the fact that it was pretty low in the sky totally freaked me out. I just know something was strange about this and i felt very much like this object was kind of scoping out the area. I called the hotline for the first time to report this because this is the only time I have ever seen anything like this and felt that it was important enough to report it.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
strange vertical lights over chicago;2003-01-13 21:30:00;45 min-1 hour;strange vertical lights over chicago Last night on my drive home(approx. 15 miles) I noticed that the sky was much brighter than normal.  I noticed vertical lights in the sky that seemed to be projecting light from the sky to the ground.  On my journey home I must have seen about 40 - 50 of these lights.  some of those lights where alone and others where paired up in 3 - 4 lights equidistance of one another.  whats stranger is that these lights couldnt have been commercial advertizment because they could be scene for a distance of 10 - 20 miles away and where in areas like forest preseves and even as far as into lake michigan.  I called a few friends in different areas and they all confirmed the lights, as well as some callers did to a popular music station that i was listening to at the time.  at about 10:00 central time after arriving at my house i took out my digital camera and took a few pictures at the same time i saw military aircraft flying around. Today I didnt hear anything on the news about the matter. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness, who elects to remain semi-anonymous,  implies a nighttime sighting.

UFO Sighting in downtown Chicago;2003-12-28 22:30:00;15 seconds;UFO Sighting in downtown Chicago At almost exactly 10:30 P.M. on December 28th 2003, i saw a UFO in downtown Chicago.  I was walking along the lake, going southbound on the walk right next to the lake, a few hundred feet before the buckingham fountain pathway.  From my perspective it looked as if it were hoovering over the shed aquerium and the observatory.  It moved VERY quickly and manuvered around as if it were a toy plane being flown.  The lights on the UFO seemed to blink like a normal plane but it was deffinitly not a plane.  There were broken up clouds across the sky, as if they were providing protection from being seen.  When i made it back into my appartment, on michigan ave., i noticed a plane, or jet going very fast across the sky, toward the lake.  At approxamently 11:15 A.M., December 29th 2003, there was a hellicopter that flew JUST over the buildings, which is VERY low and very unorthadox considering the terrorist threats.

Same UFO from Orland Parlk / Tinley Park?;2004-08-20 22:00:00;45 minutes;Same UFO from Orland Parlk / Tinley Park? On Friday, August 20th I drive home on Archer Ave. heading west. I had just finished renting couple of movies from Blockbuster Video. As I drove on Archer Ave. I saw a plane which I thought it was, but the flickering lights was what changed my mind that this was no plane, helicopter or any man object.  As I approached home, this object kept going in circles (counter clock-wise). I parked my car and kept looking at it. It made no sound. At this time I was in front of my home. So I called my dad to come look at this. he was laying down on the bed watching the news. When I told him to bring the video camera, he jumped and knew I wasn't kidding. As my father was getting the video camera, I kept watching this object making its counter clock-wise circles when suddenly it cut through the circle. It was like drawing a circle and half way through the circle making a straight line to where you starting at. It was weird.  When my dad came out, he said, it's a helicopter. I insisted that it wasn't when suddenly 3 fire balls fell from this object. One after the other. They looked like small comets burning down from the sky. Now the object shot north bound then toward us in great speed heading to the Orland Park/Tinley Park vincinity.  I called 911, to report this, but they didn't care. So here is my story. What it was, I believe it wasn't from this world that's for sure!  R.Enriquez;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178
What could it be ??;2004-09-18 06:31:00;UNK;What could it be ?? After returning to Chicago after working in Wisconsin overnight, we made Chicago just after daybreak and were standing in front of our shop unloading our tools, both of us (my work partner and I), both commented on how strange the clouds looked today. After a few seconds we found ourselves both staring at the same place in the sky for a minute and commenting to each other it was a strange feeling about that one particlar spot that kept making us glance up to that point in the sky. I joked that there was probably a U.F.O up there that we couldn't see with our eyes, but could more or less sense. I got our camera and snapped a couple of pics. of the cloud bank and sure enough when I downloaded them to the compter something showed up, I'm not saying I was right but there seemed to be a presence up there getting our attention.

UFO's seen at The Chicago Air Show!;2005-08-20 14:30:00;10-15 seconds;UFO's seen at The Chicago Air Show! During the air and water show I saw for about 10 seconds 2 flickering unconventional flying objects from my high-rise apartment fly across the sky about 10 seconds apart from one another from west to east at a high rate of speed and altitude north of the air show.  The estimated speed was 3000 mph, then slowed down to 500 mph then sped up and slowed down again and went behind an apartment building and a very slow rate of speed compared to the beginning of the sighting.  Later on I saw a lot of military aircraft flying in the area of the sighting and was wondering why the grand finally jets weren't performing.  The next day I found out the Thunderbird air show was canceled because something fell off some jet.  I found that to be very coincidental and perhaps was just a cover-up excuse and it really was because the air show's airspace was violated by unknown boggies or perhaps one of the unconventional flying objects bummed into one of the jets (midair collision) and caused damage.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

I immediately called my daughter, so that she can see that I was not seeing things!  She couldn't believe what she saw either!  It continued to move higher into the sky, and I saw another one coming from another direction and it looked like it went right up to the other one, and both of them just kept on going.

Very low and slow-flying aircraft;2006-12-13 23:00:00;45 minutes;Very low and slow-flying aircraft I'm not sure exactly what I saw, all I know is that I kept hearing all of these extremely loud aircraft noises in my neighborhood, which is usually quiet and quite far from any airport.  I started to get freaked out after about 15 minutes and went the window.  I saw an aircraft of some kind flying VERY low--in contrast to commercial jets in the sky, which from a ground view have tiny blinking lights, the proximity to this aircraft was such that the lights appeared to be the size of grapefruits.   I couldn't see the exact shape, only that three lights (white-red-white) were kind of lined up in a straight line, and they cast a glow on a kind of underbelly shape I could only glimpse.  My thought was that the shape of the thing was almost rectangular, or a straight line, with a very slightly convex underside. The lights were strong enough that I thought, 'they can see me!' through my window, though who knows, and I went away from the window and the aircraft nosies lasted about another half hour.  It sounded to me like there were more than one thing zooming around and around.  I don't have a whole lot of experience with stuff like this, and there is probably another kind of explanation I'm only reporting it because I found it very mysterious and thought it might make sense to someone else.

What i saw was a flash of light.  The flash was multi colored, with white in the center and a gradient outward.  The flash was fan shaped.  The narrowest part would have started at ground level and it fanned out upwards.  This light was much brighter than movie premier lights.  I saw it 3 times.  The light flashed for one second.  Then 5 minutes later i saw it again for one second, then once more about 5 minutes later it flashed.  There was no sound accompanied by the lights.  If i had to guess where the source of the light was, i would say it was around Chicago's Pilsen neighborhood.

Craft stationary over highway during high traffic;2009-04-15 18:00:00;10 minutes;Craft stationary over highway during high traffic Spring (maybe April) 2008 or 2009 Near O’Hare airport, heading east, towards Chicago, on I-90.  My wife, daughter, and I had just returned from a trip to Florida.   The car was parked in the airport’s long term parking and the sky was clear.  It was probably around 5-7pm, so still light out.  We had just left the winding highway roads around the airport and were driving east on I-90 towards Chicago.  Directly in front of us, in the distance, I could see a low, bright light over the highway.  I remember thinking, “Interesting that that plane is flying directly in parallel with the highway and so low.”  I assumed it was just an airplane lined up to land at the airport and that it would quickly turn off from the seemingly straight path it was taking above the highway.   However, as I continued to drive, it seemed to continue its straight path directly towards us.  I mentioned something about it to my wife, but she didn’t seem interested (I think she was distracted on her phone, maybe texting her parents that we were on the ground heading home).  As we got closer to it it remained in ! place, and I remember thinking, “Wow, that is low!”   As we got closer, I noticed it was not moving but stationary above the highway, with cars zipping along under it in both directions, as if nothing were there.  As we drove under it, I looked up, leaning up a bit to look through the windshield in front of me.  As we passed under, it was approximately 20 feet above the highway, and it looked as if it were man-made.  By that I mean it had large pipes, or ducts, and other mechanical-ish type looking parts.  It must have been huge as I only was able to see a small part or section as we went under.  After this, the strangest feeling happened.  All of a sudden, I had this feeling of elation and felt as if I was the best and cleverest driver in the world, with the ability to quickly, and without effort, maneuver the car in and out of traffic like a pro (almost felt like flying).  I think I looked back in the rear view mirror a couple times as the light diminished as we drove further from it.  Afterwards, and over the last many years, I still go over it in my mind and am still mystified by it. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

However, the lights while they were red were dim and more of a reddish brown, no other lights flashing or otherwise were spotted.  The lights moved very uniform and very much in sync, flying south. As the lights started to turn towards the east, at about ten seconds after initial sighting, the lights spread out far apart, again very much in uniform, flying very aerodynamic just like an airplane.  The lights continued to turn back towards the north, completing a ‘U’ shape trajectory, and the lights moved back towards each other in their original position, next to each other.  The lights moved consistently, never stopping and moved fast.  The total duration of the sighting was about 30 seconds.;41.8841229180932;-87.6674748940178

UFO’s spotted in Chicago in the early morning on 10/12/12.;2012-10-12 04:10:00;1-2 hours;UFO’s spotted in Chicago in the early morning on 10/12/12. I woke up at about 4:10am on 10/12/2012 because Venus and the Moon were supposed to be the closest together on this date. When I woke up, I noticed a third planet. I thought it could’ve been Jupiter, but then realized it wasn’t located at that point at that time I rested for a few minutes then checked on the third lighted object again (still in the same place). This was in the eastern sky. I got out the binoculars and looked at the third planet, which turned out to be an aircraft. Just in the sky, motionless. Then it flew south maybe around 4:18-4:20am. There were two-three circular lights on the bottom of the aircraft (white lights) and a sky-blue blinking light toward the back of it. I started to, now, observe the sky with the binoculars and noticed multiple flying objects (which appeared very small) with red and white blinking lights). They might have been commercial flights but seemed to be moving slowly and not so steadily like a commercial flight would. They seemed to also slow down and sit behind some of the cloud coverage on an otherwise clear night. All in all, there were probably about 10-12 flying objects (but 5 or so could’ve been commercial/international flights). I looked out at the lake now, and in Chicago there are water sanitization stations in the middle of the lake. I noticed two-three objects around one of the stations (through binoculars). The lights did not look like boats (they were not red/green) they were white flashing lights and one had three lights that would light up and down (not as a boat would), and were small. They were out there “surrounding” the water filtration station for 2 hours (until 6am). After that, I don’t know, because I went to bed. At one point, the large brightly lit object (that I had first thought to be a planet) came back, this time from the north. It stayed in the sky and hovered for a couple minutes, then came over my head (I was located in a tall building). It was brightly lit, lights were under the object – so hard to make out the shape (it seemed to have maybe 5-6 circular white lights on the bottom and a sky-blue flashing light too). However, there was no sound whatsoever. My background includes growing up in Chicago, where I attended good schools. I work about every day, so my sleep schedule is sometimes off. I’ve always loved looking at planets through binoculars and have a natural curiosity toward the solar system (even though that is not my career focus).

Security camera sighting over O'Hare International Airport;2018-08-20 12:47:00;>4 hours;Security camera sighting over O'Hare International Airport I live just east of O’hare international airport and recently setup a security camera pointing almost directly west overlooking the airfield sky.  I setup the camera to only record motion (free 14 days of motion recording) and let it run. The next day I decided to check out some of the night time motion triggers thinking that I would get another racoon/skunk sighting. Instead I got something that I can't really explain. I first checked a recording at 5:09 AM and noticed that the usual insect tripped the motion.  Upon further inspection of the video, I noticed 2 small lights in the sky.  I rewatched and noticed that they were hovering slightly.  I then started going back in time about every 20 minutes or so and noticed that the 2 lights were roughly floating in the same position.  I kept going back in time (about 4 hours) to 12:47 AM to see if I could find where the lights entered the frame. The lights appeared above the treeline and rapidly moved up and over to assume a position where it remained for over 4 hours hovering slightly. It looks to me as a pair of 2 lights connected by something, probably the aircraft, and moved in unison. Feel free to access the Google drive folder below for most of the videos recorded and a “line of sight” map of the camera:  https://drive.google.com/open?id=17Xh_F7DNv-a8kILooFX_BsEIe2fE6akU ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Peter, I see the lights in the sky again and it seems like it is some sort of infrared guidance system for the planes to land. Obviously, it can only be seen with a IR security camera and the video from 12:47 looks like they were doing some sort of calibration and then bringing it in line for the planes to land.
