((HOAX??))  Huge Black Boomerang & Gray Disk Spotted Within 15 Minutes--Park Ridge, IL...Near O'Hare Airport.;2008-06-18 14:10:00;15 Minutes;Huge Black Boomerang & Gray Disk Spotted Within 15 Minutes--Park Ridge, IL...Near O'Hare Airport. I am located about 3 miles northeast of O’Hare. I checked out the sky on my lunch today...June 18th at around 2:10 pm....I swear to God...I have never seen anything in my life...I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me...I saw...a boomerang....huge and low...it hovered, turned west and disappeared...Then about 15 minutes later...I saw a saucer shaped object head into a cloud formation at a high rate of speed.  I will take a drug test and a polygraph....I have been stone cold sober for almost six years.  I never saw ANYTHING until I wrote a screenplay based upon the cosmic Watergate conspiracies...called 'Nightmare Hall'...then they started showing up....Man I wish I had a camera...out there today...but honestly...they were so quick....I never would have gotten a good photo...but I swear they are showing up here all the time now....and I will produce evidence and post to this site for sure...I am going to work on it....Check out the skies…experimental or alien…it sure is fun to wonder.  Once you see it…you will believe.  Just watch the skies....especially at night...I swear you will start to see something if you are in or near...Illinois....Most look like a star moving....but wait until it stops and hovers...and keep your eyes on it...and it will explode with a flash of light...and take off...It is totally amazing!!  Never seen ANYTHING BEFORE....and now it is about 2 or 3 per night...every single night since June 7th....I actually lost count.  Most of them are way up there...so binoculars will help if you don't have 20-10 vision like me...But today...it was lower...and you could see it for sure....most of these are a bright orb at night...and NOT Venus...which can be clearly viewed to the east right now....I want to tell my story...but I need evidence first...and I am not kidding....I am about to call UFO Hunters, the National UFO Reporting Center, or MUFON, as they will see something for sure...It happens nightly....But today was the first time I saw one during the day...You have to ! keep you r mind and eyes open....and you will see one for sure...No doubt about it...I want someone else to confirm it....please watch the skies...and comment if you see something...take an hour at night....when you see the orb start to move...you will believe me. I guess it took a UFO conspiracy screenplay...for them to finally show up in my life.  Today I jumped up out of my lawnchair when I saw the boomerang...it was huge...and black...fifteen minutes later was my first flying saucer too...what the hell is going on?  No way anyone would believe me...until you see it for yourself....I swear I saw what I saw...& I cannot change that.  No one believes me...but you will when you see one. I know what I saw was either experimental or alien.  No craft I have ever seen looked like either of these two things...never seen anything move so fast in my life.  The disk was gray in color...and the boomerang was all black...very low, and very huge.  It didn't take off...it vanished.  The disk disappeared into a huge cloud. The disk was not bigger than a commercial plane...it was the size of a jet fighter. ((NUFORC Note:  One of several reports from the same source.
