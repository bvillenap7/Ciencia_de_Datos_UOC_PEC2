Bizarre sighting in O'Hare airspace 5/23/2018 8:15 am - 8:25 am Just north of airport.  ((anonymous report));2018-05-23 08:20:00;6-8 minutes;Bizarre sighting in O'Hare airspace 5/23/2018 8:15 am - 8:25 am  Just north of airport. During my workday. I watch a departing airliner traveling north out of O'Hare at 8:15 am at maybe two thousand feet and climbing. I noticed to the west of the departing aircraft an object traveling east.  I thought that there was a potential conflict (incursion) developing with what I thought at the time were two aircraft so I continued to watch.  The flight that left O'Hare continued on without incident I continued to watch the object heading east and  coming towards me wanting to see what this object really was and realizing it was at a higher altitude. As it approach I could faintly see a solid object then a reflection of sun turning it into a bright pin point of light much like a star.  From my vantage point, I would say this object was a mile north of O'Hare at an altitude of seven to ten thousand feet when it stopped and stayed in place. I could not make out what I was looking at.  The weather was mostly clear with just a few small clouds around the area After minutes in place it moved south towards O'Hare about a mile then slowly climbed all the time looking like a bright star.  I have no idea what this object I witnessed was.  After this sighting, I noticed that departures to the north stopped.  I thought that air traffic control may be trying to figure this out.  I called my wife to tell her about this incidence and that she may see something on the news.  I would like to call O'Hare about this.  I watched this whole thing for probaly eight minutes.  Very bizarre, very puzzling.  Perhaps military security surveillance.  I am very much into aviation I am not making this up.
