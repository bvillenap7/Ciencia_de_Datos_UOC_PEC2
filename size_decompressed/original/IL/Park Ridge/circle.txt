Two very bright, large stars/dots in sky very near O'Hare airport.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus and Jupiter.  PD));2004-11-05 05:25:00;40 minutes;Two very bright, large stars/dots in sky very near O'Hare airport, Chicago travel together to the South. Two very bright large stars/dots in sky very near O'Hare airport, Chicago. The larger bright star/dot is slightly lower than the smaller. Both are traveling slowly to the South. Even as daybreak is beginning they appear very bright--stars are no longer visible. I woke up at 5:20 a.m and noticed these two strange and very bright lights. I watched them for about 15 minutes and then woke my husband.  After he observed them, we decided to report our observation. ((NUFORC Note:  Venus and Jupiter.  PD));42.0094;-87.8354
((HOAX??))  It was a very large and extremely bright white orb moving slowly in a SW direction slightly southeast of O'Hare Airport.;2008-06-06 21:22:00;2 minutes;It was a very large and extremely bright white orb moving slowly in a southeastern direction slightly southeast of O'Hare Airport. I have lived 5 minutes from Oâ€™Hare Airport for 32 years.   I know full what a helicopter or plane look and sound like.   I have seen tons of meteors when I lived Arizona for 8 years. This was neither.   It was a very large and extremely bright white orb moving slowly in a southeastern direction, seemingly at a very high altitude.  In fact, you may start receiving reports from downtown, the southern side of Chicago, and in Indiana shortly.  I have never seen anything like it.   It was completely silent, and moved slowly and smoothly.  It was at a very high altitude, so the size of this thing was astonishing.  It was heading into a southeastern direction.  There was no trailer, no flashing lights, and it was brighter than the moon.  My guess is that it was an un-manned orb used for surveillance.   It was approximately 2.5 miles southeast of O'Hare Airport, so the radar had to pick it up for sure. ((NUFORC Note:  One of several reports from the same source.  We do not know whether they have been submitted as serious-minded reports, or whether they are hoaxes.  PD));42.0094;-87.8354
