Red egg-shaped object followed by boxkite type of structure;2014-06-13 13:00:00;15 seconds;Red egg-shaped object followed by boxkite type of structure I am always looking up at the sky.  It was clear.  The sky was pale blue with no cumulus clouds in sight.  I observed what appeared to be a red egg-shaped object in the sky moving westwardly (Object A).  I guessed it could be a red party balloon until I realized that if it was a party balloon, it was positioned far too high in the sky for me to have been able to discern either a shape or color. Then I saw a second structure (Object B) following behind it.  Object B was not solid, and I can only describe it as being similar to an old fashioned box kite.  Both objects appeared to be at the same height, moving westward and the whole incident lasted no more than 15 seconds.  Then both objects abruptly disappeared.  The objects did not fall nor did they go behind a cloud . . . both objects were just gone. Possibly this can be explained as something common or ordinary, but I have never seen anything like this before.;42.0003;-88.1422
