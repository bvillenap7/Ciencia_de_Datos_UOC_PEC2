Possible triangle caught on tape in Illinois.;2003-11-13 05:00:00;2 MIN;Possible triangle caught on tape in Illinois. It was 5:10 AM on Nov. 13th. I was letting my dog outside and I noticed a bright light to the south. It was still dark outside at this time. At first I thought it was a plane but it was not on a normal flight path. I know this because I watch the sky quite often. Also it was moving too slow to be a plane. After about 30 seconds of watching this light move to the north I decided to get my camcorder. I began to record and as I zoomed in I was shocked. There were three bright lights in the shape of a triangle. I taped it for about 30 seconds before my battery went dead. I have watched this tape a dozen times and can see the faint outline of the triangle. Unfortunatly it is on a actual hi-fi mini tape and I cannot zoom in on the object. I need help getting this put into digital format.;42.0003;-88.1422

7 ufo triangles HUGE over hanover park, then stopped in mid air and rotated lights to look like constelations!;2010-09-05 03:53:00;5-7 minutes;7 ufo triangles HUGE over hanover park, then stopped in mid air and rotated lights to look like constelations! was smoking a cigarett and looked up in a cler night sky at 3:53 am to see a  formation of 7 (almost see through) craft, they seamed to glide over the night sky andwere HUGE, the only thing one could see is 5 lights (might have been 7) with one craft in the lead they had onelight in front and ten going outwards into a triangle 2 more and 2 more  one in the lead and 3 behind him and3 behind them, the strange thing is that they stopped as if they hoovered, and all of them started rotating their lights to resemble constelations, and in about 5 seconds a massive cloud cover came over the sky (unnatural) to cover them a couple miles in a radius, the whole event lasted about 5-7 minutes i wish i had a camera, it was something else! all 7 of them made it looks like 3 different constelations, they were workingin sync! moved very slow. put wrong date in other report sorry (remake);42.0003;-88.1422
