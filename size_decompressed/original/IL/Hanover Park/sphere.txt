Red/orange silent sphere;2012-07-04 00:00:00;1 minute;red/orange silent sphere I was at a fourth of july party.  I had seen a red/orange sphere.  The object would increase and decrease in brightness. I thought it was a fire work but I saw that it was moving.  I could not identify it because it was too high to be an rc plane, no planes or helicopters are spheres, and it was completely silent.  I have heard planes and helicopters from above but this thing made no noise.;42.0003;-88.1422
Spherical, metallic object rising very high in the sky. Drone or something else?;2017-07-18 13:00:00;5 minutes;A spherical, metallic object rising very high in the sky.  Drone or something else? I was sitting in my car in a parking lot when I saw something appear in the horizon, coming from the northwest.  My first impression was that it was a balloon, as it floated and fluttered in the blue sky (no clouds whatsoever).  It appeared to be spherical in shape, metallic, reflecting the sun.  I also noticed that it slowly twirled in a circular motion.   Then it began to move upward in a more deliberate fashion, going way, way up in the sky, from the northwest to the east.  Then it crossed my mind that it could be a drone but Iâ€™ve never heard of a drone that rose up into the sky that high, perhaps as high as an airplane.   I managed to snap a couple of photos with my phone, when it was closer to the ground, and I sent them to the link as requested.;42.0003;-88.1422
