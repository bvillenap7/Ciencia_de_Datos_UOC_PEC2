I smelled something unusual in the air like sulfur. I looked up at the stars and I noticed three stars blinked different colored lights. One star blinked red, another blinked green, one blinked a blueish color, and the other star was white. They were formed in a isolates triangle. If an aircraft was in the vicinity of one it would hover towards it. When it would hover I could see and trail of light coming from it.  A little farther up I noticed what looked to be a oval-shaped object. About 5:00 a.m. CST I noticed lights coming for it in the shape of a circle with a Y inside. The lights were white and would fade on and off. About four time I would see a beam-like  flash of light coming from the oval-shaped object.  The white star seemed to follow the oval shaped object. All were heading in a northwestern pattern at a decent speed.  I also noticed that animals were acting strange. My cats were running, hiding, and refusing to go near and also a male deer came up close to me.  Around 5:40 I let my cats in my house. I came outside only find all possible UFOs had disappeared.  I attempted to record it with my digital camcorder but I doubt the objects were bright enough to be recorded.;40.5228;-91.3335
