Me,My wife, and my son where out side and saw 4-5 bright moving objects that seem to be moving and flashing many colors,  then all of a sudden,  An object flew Super fast from the top of a house next to us,  Shot up in the sky and was gone,   Now I could clearly see that the object was orange and it did not seem fuzzy or anything.   I have never been a sky watcher or anything, but I know what I saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));41.0176;-89.4004
