Box shaped cylinder  moves siletly over suburbs of Chicago;2007-02-08 16:45:00;5-10 Minutes;Box shaped cylinder  moves siletly over suburbs of Chicago I was traveling in my car eastbound on Lake Street in Roselle Il.  It was still light out.  I saw in the sky to the east, about 300 feet in the air a square shaped cylinder.  It could best be described as a giant box kite.  It was dark tan-brownish in color.  At first I thought it was an advertising banner the kind that fly over sporting events. There was no airplane pulling this thing.  It was about 100-150 feet long and about 30-40 feet high and wide.  It left no smoke or vapor in its wake.  If there had been an airplane pulling it then I would have heard an engine.  This object made no sound.It seemed to be covered in a cloth because the outside of the object looked like it flutered in the wind.;41.9755;-88.0877999999999
