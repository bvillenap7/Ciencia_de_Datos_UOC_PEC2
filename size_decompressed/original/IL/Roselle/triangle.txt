fast moving Triangle with no sound and orange lights, stops hovers and speeds off.;1988-01-01 03:00:00;2-3 min;fast moving Triangle with no sound and orange lights, stops hovers and speeds off. While taking out the trash on cold winter in 1988 or 1989 I was watching and hearing the planes fly towards from the west towards ohare. With it being crisp you can hear every sound. I saw a large triangle with orange lights approaching fast from the south, but it made no sound. It was much higher than the planes but not by much or it was just so big it appeared closer. I stared at it as it stopped suddenly overhead. It just stopped and was still. The orange lights were lit around the perimeter of the triangle. I was gripped with fear waiting for a beam to come down. But then it moved slowly south across my neigborhood but was still silent. I ran after it as my sight was getting hampered by trees. Then it sped off towards the south east at a high rate of speed and was out of sight. It never made a sound. As soon as it was gone I could hear another incoming plane. The sound of the plane comes much before I can actually see it. I waqs standing there staring at the sky mesmorized by what I just saw. I have not told this story to many people and never reported it, until now due that I saw the same traingle in a UFO story on tv and it sent chills up my spine.
