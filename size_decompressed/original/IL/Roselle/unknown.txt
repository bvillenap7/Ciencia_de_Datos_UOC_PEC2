3 pulsing red/orange lights heading south to north at a slow pace.;2015-01-10 19:35:00;1 minute;3 pulsing red/orange lights heading south to north at a slow pace. Looking out a south facing window, I noticed 3 red to orange lights.  They were pulsing the colors (not blinking).   The sky was clouded.  Within seconds of my seeing the lights, one of them disappeared.  I believe it entered the cloud layer.  I lost the other two as they continued to head north and past my line of vision.   I checked out a north facing window, but did not see the lights again. Note â€“ I am 12 miles west of O'Hare airport, and 1 mile from a small local airport.  These lights were clearly not planes. I opened the window, and heard no sound. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) It was 1/10/15, sorry for the error.   I've heard you talk about fire balls on C2C for sometime now, and I've read many of the reports online.  It would seem to me that they would/should be making noise.  Do people note that?  I heard nothing and the speed of what I saw was way to slow in my mind for these to be falling rocks, etc..   In this case, I am leaning towards controlled objects, but I can now see how people would use the term 'fire ball' to describe them. ((END ADDENDUM));41.9755;-88.0877999999999
