Lights/spheres near Chicago city.;2019-09-25 18:30:00;2+;Lights/spheres near Chicago city While driving I witnessed four blinking lights hovering almost still in the air.  Some of the smaller ones would only move at a very slow speed to the sides one of them moved higher, but the bigger one would stand still.  A few of the small ones disappeared and reappeared at times.  Once I got on the highway I was able see them more clearly only this time they appeared to be bigger and in a sphere shape.  They were lined up with with some distance next to each other and 2 or three more higher on top. In total 7-8 of them.  Airplanes were flying near by and the difference was clear. I was able to get a video of the first time I spotted them but not as I was driving in the highway.  As there was a lot of traffic.;41.9755;-88.0877999999999
