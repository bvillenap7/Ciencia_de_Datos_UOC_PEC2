Flash of light.;2015-10-06 22:30:00;seconds;flash of light Was sitting outside when in the south sky I saw a bright light move from east to west.  It was like an extremely slow moving meteor.  Only in was right above the horizon and went across the sky, unlike any meteorite I've ever seen.  It was almost like the light skipped.  It wasnt a streak where the light is solid but, rather like a dash of light.  Quite a bit more aircraft in the sky afterwards than normal.
