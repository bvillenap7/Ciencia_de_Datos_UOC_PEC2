Directly south I watched a solid white light descend from sky from about 80째, moved really slow and got increasingly bright.  It disappeared at 50째.  Approximately 30sec later from the same 50째 point a dimmer white flashing light moving south to SE slowly moved in a slight zig zag motion.   Approx 30secs after it left my view due to trees  the exact same thing happened again. 30 secs later another one.  The 4th object had a solid red light, but moved just as slow.  About 1 min after red light left my view it was back to dim white flashing light, and 1 min later, I saw the last same white flashing light.   All 6 going from S-SE appeared from exact location and took the same zig zag path to SE. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
