Looking from my bedroom window to the west, I saw 6 sparkling lights in the sky.  At first I thought that they were possibly airplanes, satellites, or twinkling stars, but they were bright and close enough together not to be planes.  They were slowly moving downward in a southern direction.  Two of them slowly faded away while holding their position, while the remaining four kept moving in a southern direction until I couldn't see them anymore.  I've never seen sparkling lights in the morning sky moving in such a curved, symmetrical pattern.  Interesting to watch, but odd.;41.9237;-87.8139999999999
