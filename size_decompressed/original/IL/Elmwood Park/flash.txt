And i look across the street, sideways to the Highschool, and look up, and i see this blue-green flash, with an aura. Then, I see another one, the first one blinked 3 times, then zoomed away, then the other blue one blinked once then went right, then upward into the sky. No, i didnt get this on video, or picture but it was pretty noticable.;41.9237;-87.8139999999999
