I HEARD A LOUD CRASH LIKE FARM MACHINARY SHUTTING DOWN OR GYM DOORS CLOSING IN AN EMPTY GYM. AT THE SAME TIME OF THE SOUND I SAW A GREEN FLOODLIGHT SWITCHED ONTO THE GROUND W/ A 50 FT. DIAMETER IN NEIGHBOR'S SIDE YARD DIRECTLY INFRONT OF ME,THIS HOUSE SAT ON A CORNER LOT. ABOVE INERSECTION OF STREET WAS A DARK METAL,IRON LOOKING CRAFTW/ A GIANT CICULAR HOLE IN THE BOTTOM WHICH THE FLOODLIGHT WENT UP TO AND STOPPED ABRUTLY IN THE SPACE OF THE DIAMETER OF A LARGE METAL RIM. IT SLSO CAME OUT OF THE ENTIRE RIM. I WALKED TO THE CORNER ABOUT 100 FT. AND LOOKED DIRECTLY INTO THE CRAFT,IT HAD A SMALL CIRCULAR ROOM, THE ENTIRE WALL WAS NOTHING BUT WHITE LIGHT IT JUST HUNG THERE MOTIONLESS W/ NO SOUND.

My cousin and I have been going up on the roof of my 3-story building every clear night for the past week.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus? PD));2010-05-11 22:00:00;1 hour;My cousin and I have been going up on the roof of my three-story building every clear night for the past week or two, and last night, we finally saw some activity.   First, right when we got up on the roof, to the right from us in the sky I saw a small, bright orange light that was moving across the sky.  Then, it got dimmer quickly and then COMPLETELY disappeared.   About a half hour afterwards, my cousin and I were watching what I thought was a star.  It is there every night in about the same place, and blinks red, blue, and other colors almost like a strobe light.  Last night, though, we were watching it very closely and in less than an hours time, the star had moved very slowly to the right, so much so that it could not have been a star.  Then, the star was moving up and down slightly, and left to right very slightly.   Soon after it was moving that way, another small, bright orange light appeared up and to the right of it, OUT OF NOWHERE went down and to! the right and back up fairly quickly, and completely disappeared.   Afterwards, the bright star moved even more to the right and up, and right before we went inside, another small bright orange light appeared and flew right over us and the roof.;40.4644095808383;-89.0058706586827
Two bright, large crafts moving slowly in a north to south direction over Bloomington, IL on Sunday, March 25th at 8:45pm.;2012-03-25 20:45:00;10 minutes;Two bright, large crafts moving slowly in a north to south direction over Bloomington, IL on Sunday, March 25th at 8:45pm. At 8:45pm, Central Standard time, I was in my driveway and witnessed a large, glowing object moving from the north to the south directly above my position at a relatively slow rate of speed.  It was the color of a flame - the illumination remained consistent - except that, looking through binoculars, it appeared as if the light was moving from left to right - as if scanning the sky, in a consistent pattern.  The craft made no sound, and appeared to be at an altitude of approx. 2,000 - 3,000 feet.  When the craft was directly overhead, the light was no longer visible, however it was apparent that it was circular in shape.  As the craft moved from directly overhead southward, a dim light was visible, but only a fraction of what was emanating from the front.  After the initial craft disappeared in the south sky, a second craft appeared moving in the same north - south track, at the same rate of speed.  Both crafts were identical in appearance.  Neither craft had any blinking lights, nor were they moving at a speed that would be required by an airplane to remain aloft.  I took a few pictures of the crafts, only one of which turned out decent.  I also filmed some HD video, however, because it was dark, it did not turn out well.  The first craft was witnessed by my wife and myself.  The second craft was also witnessed by our nextdoor neighbors (who we invited to watch with us).;40.4644095808383;-89.0058706586827
