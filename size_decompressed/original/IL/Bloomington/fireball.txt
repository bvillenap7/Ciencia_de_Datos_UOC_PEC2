Orange Ball Rising Above Town At 45 Degree Angle;2012-03-17 19:30:00;20 Seconds;Orange Ball Rising Above Town At 45 Degree Angle Saw orange ball from SE side of Bloomington while facing directly NW.  I was on East side of small subdivision lake with dog at 7:30 PM.  The object rose at roughly 45 degrees up from somewhere towards the South West side of town over the houses on opposite side of lake (off in distance somewhere).  It then suddenly/sharply arched slightly higher and back down slightly and continued at a 30 degree angle up and I lost it as it went through cloud cover towards the North.  The sighting lasted roughly 20 seconds or so. This was facing a side of town away from all air traffic which made me certain it was not a plane, as was the fact that there were no strobes (only the orange steady glow) and the fact that airport was directly behind me at the time.

Around 30 orange glowing objects flying in a constant speed towards South West Direction.;2013-09-22 21:03:00;2 minutes;Around 30 orange glowing objects flying in a constant speed towards South West Direction As I was driving in to my garage around 9 pm, I saw a bunch of orange lit fire ball shaped objects flying as a group towards the South West Direction.   They were flying in constant speed.   The number of objects would be around 20-30 of them.   The full object was glowing in orange instead and so it was not looking like a head light of a air craft.   I took pictures , but they are not very clear.;40.4644095808383;-89.0058706586827
