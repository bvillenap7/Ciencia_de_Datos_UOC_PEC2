two lights hovering, then turning into 4 lights in a triangle pattern;2008-01-09 22:00:00;10 minutes;two lights hovering, then turning into 4 lights in a triangle pattern It started by seeing two lights hovering around outskirts of town while driving on a highway that goes around the edge of Bloomington/Normal (Veteran's Parkway).  It seemed like a helicopter based on flight speed and altitude (1000 ft or lower)  Then the object appeared to hover motionless above downtown area.  Then, it seemed to be getting very close to my residence after I pulled into my driveway.  I exited my vehicle, and walked out onto the street to get a better view.  The two lights were directly in line with my street (Koch St. in Bloomington)  Then, the object appeared to bank to the right, and I saw 4 lights in a triangle formation.  One light at the front, and 3 across the back.  It made no noise whatsoever, and slowly moved across the sky from west to east.  It then dissappeared behind trees and houses while I was looking at it from my backyard porch.;40.4644095808383;-89.0058706586827
