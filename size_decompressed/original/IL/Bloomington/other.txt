Driving home saw object with white lights;2009-02-17 15:00:00;40 seconds;Driving home saw object with white lights I saw this object and thought it was a plane with landing lights on but then I noticed all the extra white lights on the body and wings of the object.  The wings were much shorter than that of an airplane and was much darker than an airplane. The object was oblong with short stubby wings.  The object was first seen between Main and Center streets in Bloomington, IL moving SW and not making any noise that I could hear on February 17, 2009.  The objects underbelly is where line of extra white lights from front to back and several lights on the wings were noticed. I only saw this one object in the area.;40.4644095808383;-89.0058706586827
Craft appear in photographs at Bloomington, IL regional airport;2016-07-29 16:00:00;Unknown;Craft appear in photographs at Bloomington, IL regional airport Photos taken in Bloomington, IL, of my daughter and me when she dropped me off at the regional airport appear to show two different types of craft in the sky above us, triangular and so-called cigar shaped.   The photos were taken on my Samsung Galaxy S6 smartphone in immediate succession, yet the craft are in different positions.   In addition, no similar shapes appeared in photos before or since, indicating not a defect with the phone's CCD.  I heard nothing the craft simply were in the photos. ((NUFORC Note:  The witness provides several photos of the object, and although we are unable to identify the object positively, our impression is that it may be a streetlamp, located behind one of the individuals in the photo.  The sourch of the report disagrees sharply with our assessment, and we provide his comments below.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Have you looked at the photos at all?  This response is incomprehensible! ((END ADDENDUM));40.4644095808383;-89.0058706586827
