7 low flying, in formation aircraft seen over Bloomington, IL.;2015-09-12 10:00:00;60 seconds;7 low flying, in formation aircraft seen over Bloomington, IL. I was driving southbound on Towanda Ave, over the railroad bridge off of Ft. Jesse Rd. my son and I witnessed 7 black objects flying in formation about 1000 ft off the ground.  They were flying from northwest to south east in a rapid manner.   At first, I thought they were Chinook helicopters as they routinely fly over head.  However, being a 16 year vet of the Army, I've never seen Chinooks fly that fast and never in that close of formation.   Also, the profile seemed skinnier than that of a Chinook.   I heard no noise as is typical with Chinooks even at the distance, about a mile out, from my position.  It could be drilling aviation unit, but I'm not certain that it was.;40.4644095808383;-89.0058706586827
