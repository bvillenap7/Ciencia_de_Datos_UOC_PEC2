While driving south of Bloomington, IL, on Interstate 55 I saw a flat, white-illuminated object to the northeast. I was able to see it for approximately 30 seconds before losing it. I was wearing sunglasses and took them off but wasn't able to see it as well. Putting the sunglasses back on, I was able to clearly distinguish this object against the sky for a few more seconds. I would describe it as a flat line perhaps slightly bulged in the middle.;40.4644095808383;-89.0058706586827
