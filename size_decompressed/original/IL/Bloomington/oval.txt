UFO south of Bloomington, IL by Randolph Grain Elevator.;2001-08-22 23:15:00;5 minutes;UFO south of Bloomington, IL by Randolph Grain Elevator. I was driving home from work on Route 51 south from Bloomington to Heyworth Illinois on August 22nd around 23:15.  This is about a ten mile drive.  I was about half way home when I noticed three bright lights, side by side, in the sky hovering around the Randolph Grain Elevator.  I estimate the object was about 500-1000 feet in the air.  Curosity got the best of me so I turned on Randolph road and proceeded east to check things out.  As I got closer, the object was still hovering and the lights were getting brighter.  I passed the grain elevator and the object still had not moved.  I was getting closer and my cell phone rang and no one was there.  I looked later and no incomming call registered in my log on the phone.  I kept driving and then all of a sudden the object darted northeast very quickly and was gone.  I checked the flight schedule at the Central Illinois Regional Airport and nothing comes in from the south at the time.  The Airport is about 10 miles from the sighting.  There is a plane that comes in from Chicago at 11:10.  I could see the landing lights as I was stopped on the road.  I don't know what I saw as the object appeared to be an oval shape based on the layout of the lights.  The cell phone ringing and the way the object left the area is what has made me thing I saw something out of the ordinary.  Unfortunately, I have no pictures.;40.4644095808383;-89.0058706586827
