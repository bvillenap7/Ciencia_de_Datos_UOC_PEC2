They were rotating, Giving off beam's of light, They seemed like they were looking the for something. They were hovering over the airport and then moved farther out. They were flashing different colors, The Two bigger ones were brighter than the two small one's. And they all were flashing colors. The smaller two were reddish brown and also had a teal color to them that flashed, as if they were taking pictures of some sort. I know they were spacecraft's and not airplanes or helicopters I seen an airplane and it made a major wide left turn. the helicopter slowly turned around. I believe the helicopter was military it only had one light and it was blinking red. Unfortunately i couldn't see the shape but i knew when it was a UFO when i noticed two extra bright light's in the sky and no sooner then i look they zigged and then figured eight i immediately told my two friends to look.;40.4644095808383;-89.0058706586827
