Light in sky, strange non repetitive movements, high altitude;2001-08-05 22:34:00;30 minutes at least, didn;Light in sky, strange non repetitive movements, high altitude I feel kind of weird about this, but I know what I saw was not normal, and someone else witnessed it. My girlfriend and I went out into the country to look at stars. We usually go about 15 miles outside of town so the lights don't interfere with our vision. I was looking up and noticed a small point of light. It wasn't extremely bright or anything, but as I watched it it moved in multiple directions. I have seen low orbit satelites before, but this was nothing like that. It would move up, then maybe to the left, stop, and then it would go down and to the right at a high rate of speed and acceleration. Sometimes it would stay perfectly still but then begin to move again. The patters of movement seemed to be random rather than the same thing over and over again. I would ask my girlfriend, What way is it moving now?, and she would confirm the same direction that I had seen, without me telling her beforehand. I knew I wasn't crazy at that point. I don't know anything about UFO's, I never really even believed in them. I just figured, hey, we are only a small miniscule part of the entire world. So I would be self centered and nieve to believe that we are the only ones out there. If you have an explanation, please let me know. The only thing that I could come up with is that it was some sort of remote controlled satelite. But I think it was too high in the air for that. And why would a satelite make strange movements like that? Aren't satelites all going in the same direction in orbit? Do they have capabilities to change directions like that? Please respond to me if possible. My girlfriend is from Chicago but lives with me in Bloomington/Normal. We have made arrangements to pick up her dad's telescope the next time we visit them. I want to know more about what we saw. Please respond to me if you can. My e-mail is ((deleted)) or phone me at ((number deleted)) Thank you, ((name deleted));40.4644095808383;-89.0058706586827

slowly moving star like object;2009-05-31 23:00:00;10 seconds;slowly moving star like object was looking north at stars on my porch w/ my wife. saw a bright light appear far in the distance looked to be almost as far as the star i was watching. observed the light, which looked like a bright star, slowly travel in what appeared to be an upward (climbing in height) until it eventually disappeared approx 10 seconds later.;40.4644095808383;-89.0058706586827
Light traveling at high altitude flaring into a bright star then fading again;2010-10-03 20:00:00;30 seconds;Light traveling at high altitude flaring into a bright star then fading again Every evening I take my dog out into the backyard and check out the stars while the dog does his business.  On clear nights I try to spot satellites and track them as far as I can (a habit I had since I was a kid).  On this night, I spotted what looked like a typical fuzzy blueish satellite traveling slowly accross the center of the sky from south to north.  As the light headed north it grew brighter then flared into a very bright diamond shape for about 5 seconds.  Then, the light dimmed as it traveled and returned to the fuzzy dot and continued on it's path. Theres a large, very bright star/planet in the southern sky at that time of night and I would say the brightness was the same. I had the impression of something entering our atmosphere for a moment, then leaving on the same path since it never burned out like a shooting star.  At no point did the light change speed or it's trajectory. I would also like to mention that I saw something similar to the Bloomington report on 5/11/10.  However, I thought it was closer to 10pm.  I'm not sure what the person is referring to as the right side of the sky, but what I saw was red/orange light travelling slightly southwest direction.  It was moving about the same speed of a commercial jet, however it was single bright light with no strobes that you would expect to see on a jet.  There was no sound, however it came to an almost immediate stop directly above, faded, then disappeared.  I would even describe the fading as if the object rose directly up as it disappeared because it grew smaller as it faded.;40.4644095808383;-89.0058706586827
Witnessed blue orb being chased by fighter jets.;2014-06-27 03:15:00;1 minute;Witnessed blue orb being chased by fighter jets. I get home from work around 3am and sometimes when the weather is nice, I'll grab a beer and just sit out by my fire pit and enjoy the peace & quiet, and the stars. On this particular night is was quiet and the skies were crystal clear when I caught a small moving blue light out of the corner of my eye.  My first thought was a satellite (which are a fairly common sights on clear nights at 3am) but the instant my eyes fully focused it was obviously not a satellite.  It was a small glowing blue orb and it couldn't have been more than 2-3000 ft off the ground.  It came from the west and was flying due east & moving fast but it wasn't making a sound...it was flying in total silence. As I watched it pass over my house, I no more got the words, ((profanity deleted)) out of my mouth, when I heard a loud jet engine, followed by a second loud jet engine.   I turned my focus back to the west, and that's when I saw the beacon lights of two fighter jets flying in formation, and they were on the same heading, and altitude, as the blue orb.  I suppose the fighters were trying to chase it, but the orb was flying twice as fast as they were.  I then turned my attention back at the orb, and watched it fly out of sight then did the same with the fighters.   Once they were gone, I just sat down and was in awe at what I just saw. What the blue orb was, I do not know, which strictly means I couldn't ID it, thus the UFO designation.  It could have been an alien craft, or it could have been a highly advanced military aircraft, although we only have a couple small military air reserve units in the area, and nothing more as far as I know.  So I doubt top secret aircraft are being developed and test flown at or near our small air guard units in central Illinois...but who knows. So in summary, a strange blue glowing orb, with no beacon lights & no sound flew at high speed over my house in complete silence at 2-3000 ft and it was being chased by two fighter jets at 3am in the morning.  Things like this don't happen in my town at any time of the day or night let alone at 3am.  Once they were all gone, I finished my beer then went to bed wondering what I had seen and if it was aliens I wondered what in the hell an alien could have possibly found interesting in Central Illinois. I've been out there multiple times since then but other than the occasional satellite I haven't seen any more UFO's but I'm still looking. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting in 2014 is approximate.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Mr Davenport, I was talking about my sighting (see link below) tonight with my son, but I couldn't remember the date it happened, so I came back to your website to refresh my memory. Anyway, I noticed at the bottom of my report was a notation indicating the date of the sighting was approximate.  I re-read my report and I should have been more specific but the sighting occurred 3 days prior, on 6/27/14 @ approx 3am. I just wanted to provide more specific details to clear up the discrepancy.

Starlike object in western sky seen by many on multiple occasions.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus??  PD));2015-03-16 20:50:00;3 hours;Starlike object in western sky seen by many on multiple occasions. There is a large starlike object currently West of my location.  It has reappeared 3 times in last 3 weeks, and it is verified that it is not a star.  It is the brightest thing in the sky, unmoving.  Planes can be seen flying near it, and for comparison i would say 20 X larger than the jet liners at least.   There is no star in that side of the sky that is even 1/10 as bright.  Can anyone check this out with some tech? ((NUFORC Note:  Sirius??  PD));40.4644095808383;-89.0058706586827
2 bright star like lights moving quickly overheard.  ((anonymous report));2017-10-08 19:30:00;60 seconds;2 bright star like lights moving quickly overheard 2 lights, about 4 to 6 inches apart from eye view, just over the roof of our garage in the eastern sky.  Went over central Illinois regional airport.  I first thought they was stars, but they were brighter than any other star in the sky.  At I thought wow wth stars are those?  But then quickly noticed they were moving.   Ran through the house to see better and they disappeared over the tree line.  Clearly, was no plane, although there were other planes in the vicinity.
