Slight trail, but also gone in seconds. I walked out of my house to the corner to wait for my daughter.  I looked up and saw a disk shaped object high in the sky.  I watched it as it was very metallic looking.  It wasn't there but 30 seconds and then just gone.  There was just a slight trail after the disk took off.;42.4169999999999;-88.9995000000006
