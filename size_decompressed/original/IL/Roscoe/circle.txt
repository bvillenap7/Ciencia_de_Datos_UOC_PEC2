I’m not sure but I have never seen anything like it in my life. I thought for sure they were like satellites but they are moving around too fast and they do kind of look like they are dancing around if that makes any sense?? I know it sounds ridiculous but thought maybe someone might know whether or not we are just being crazy thinking that a couple satellites dancing around the sky are something more than that.  Just kind of the coolest thing we have ever seen but sort of freaking us out at the same time.  Just wondering if there was some kind of super camera that could scope in and see if they are satellites or something else?? Really don’t have anything else to say so sorry not very descriptive but feel like we might sound a little crazy. Not sure if this is the format you need, but I tried.;42.4169999999999;-88.9995000000006
Orange globe moving in the sky.;2013-12-07 21:15:00;5 seconds;Orange globe moving in the sky. While driving west on Elevator Rd. near the intersection of County Line Rd., I witnessed an orange circle about 45 degrees up in the sky straight in front of me.  I started driving up a hill so the object was straight in my line of view.  It was rather small but was a perfect circle.  The color was a very bright and warm orange.  It almost looked like an orange sitting on top of a basketball rim from the other side of the court.  It stayed very still for about two seconds after I noticed it. It then proceeded to move down toward the road, with a slight angle to the right, at an incredible rate of speed for onky a second.  I imagine it was far away based on the size of it. In order for it move that distance.  It came to a dead stop right abobe the crest of the hill for two more seconds.  Then it just vanished.
