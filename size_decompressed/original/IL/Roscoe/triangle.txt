We lived near  big apple orchard  and had just finished picking a bunch of apples. My dad and I were out on the drivewayspraying all of the apples down with the hose. Since we lived out in the country the sky was almost always bright with stars and I often found myself staring up at the sky for meteors and such. This particular night I was staring up at the sky and there, directly above us, at what seemed like miles in altitude, was a gigantic triangular thing with bright lights on each tip of  the triangle. The thing just sat there motionless for a couple of minutes. Then, without warning, it began rotating back and forth as if on a fixed point. After I came out of my state of shock I grabbed my dad and showed him what I was looking at. My dad is not very emotional. He just kind of looked at it and said, Oh yeah. My brothers and I use to see that thing out on the farm all the time when we were kids. Then he went back to spraying the apples while I flew inside the house to get my mom and grandma to show them the thing. They were frustratingly slow and was begging them to hurry. By the time we got out there, the thing was gone and I was royally p.o.ed. My dad was still standing there with the hose. I asked him where the thing went. He said he didn't know. That was the last we ever saw of the big triangle. But, I kid you not, it was one of the most wicked cool things i have ever seen. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
