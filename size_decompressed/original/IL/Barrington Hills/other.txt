As I looked up high in the southern sky and looked at the bright star or planet,  I saw a straight line of lights to the right of the star or planet.  The line was nearly vertical. It was angled 20 degrees to the right of vertical. I saw a series of lights - 12 or 14 pinpoint lights.  They were a bluish, light purple in color.  Then there was a bright light at the top.  I want to say that it was a fuchsia color, 10 times brighter than the bluish purple.   The series of lights never moved, but disappeared after about four seconds.;42.1597;-88.1414
