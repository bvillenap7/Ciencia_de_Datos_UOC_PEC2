Single bright red light bordered by two much smaller white lights.;2011-06-06 21:10:00;About 1 minute.;Single bright red light bordered by two much smaller white lights. At approximately 21:10 hours while on patrol near the intersection of Spring Creek Rd. and Ridge Rd., I observed what appeared to be a single bright red light bordered by two much smaller white lights hovering in the air to the north. The red light appeared to be roughly the same size and brightness as an LED traffic signal when viewed from about 50 - 75 yards away.  With up being 12 o'clock, the white lights appeared to be at the 4 and 8 o'clock positions with no space between the white and red light and were roughly the size of the indicator light on the car charger for my cell phone.  I did not note any flashing or discernible movement. I observed the object for about 1 minute as I attempted to drive to a better viewing position.  During this time, I stopped 3 or 4 times with an unobstructed view of the object for several seconds at a time.  Background was clear sky with a single pine tree top near to the right of the object.  As I drove west on Spring Creek Rd., my view became heavily obstructed by trees and upon returning to my original sighting location the object  appeared to be gone. Weather conditions were clear, early dusk and with plenty of light. I did not note any sunset lighting effect in the sky at the time.;42.1597;-88.1414
