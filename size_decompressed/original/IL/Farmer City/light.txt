I was returning home, traveling west on route 150, from our bank at Mansfield, IL, after making employee monthly tax deposit.  We are self-employed farmers.  Saw something flashing brighly in W/SW sky about 30 degrees up, sort of like making a dash dash patern, and going smoothly in a straight line toward a small cloud.  Only lasted about five seconds, then disappeared behind the cloud.  I looked carefully for it again, but never saw it.  It was extremely bright like neon, and the sun was not that bright that day to reflect on it.  The alternate dash pattern was very regular, too.  Just very odd, so thought I should report it.;40.25;-88.6465
