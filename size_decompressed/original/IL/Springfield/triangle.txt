Telephoned Report:  A man had his employment supervisor call on his behalf.  The witness, for some reason, hesitated to call. The employee, who works in customer service, was driving to work on Highway/Route 4 in Springfield, when he noticed a gigantic craft hovering above, and straddling, the road he was on.  He reported that the occupants of at least two other vehicles appeared to notice the object, as well, and that the cars were stopped on the edge of the roadway. The witness reported that there were some very unusual lights on the ventral surface of the craft, which was hovering motionless above the roadway. The witness reported that he observed the object for an estimated 2 minutes, and he then simply drove off. Witness stated that he would submit a report within two hours, although NUFORC has not received the report, as of four hours following the telephone call. We would welcome communications from the other alleged witnesses to this event. ((NUFORC Note:  Written report prepared by NUFORC.

Trianglular shaped craft over I-55 near Springfield, IL.;2013-12-09 19:48:00;60 seconds;Trianglular shaped craft over I-55 near Springfield, IL I was traveling north on I-55 coming into Springfield just before exit 90 Toronto Road, the skies are cloudy, no precipitation, and dark outside.  I saw these two bright lights level to each other.  I wondered what they were since they weren’t moving and close to the ground. It was about a couple hundred feet in the air, higher than the telephone towers, but not much.   As I got closer to the exit and closer to the object, I noticed that it was a triangular shape with another light in the back.  After I passed under the exit, I was directly underneath it and could see the bottom was completely lit up by the 3 lights and 1 small blue light in the middle.  The first thing that came to mind was “This isn’t completely normal. I should take a picture”.  So I rolled down the window and held my phone out the window to take the picture.  I wanted to try to get another picture but when I looked again the object was gone. The 2 pictures included are the same photo, one of the is cropped and zoomed.
