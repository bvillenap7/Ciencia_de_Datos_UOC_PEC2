Observed bright red ovals.;2000-04-09 22:30:00;25 seconds;Observed bright red ovals. April 9, 2000, at exactly 10:30 pm, my family and I observed a very bright scarlet red oval light 30 degrees high from observation point.   We observed the object appear for five seconds stationary.   The object then dropped like a rock below the tree line in seconds.  Then ten seconds later it visibly moved back up above the tree line to about 30 degrees high and remained stationary.   Seconds later a second bright red oval appeared adjacent to the first at 30 degrees high.  The second red oval moved toward the first and only one red oval was visible for a few seconds before the oval red light faded out.
