With us all being familiar with what an airplane looks like, we knew it was not that. It started out as a slowly floating red/orange/white flashing light that looked as if it was coming towards us.  Then the flying ball of light jolted up in the air.  It climbed higher and higher until it disappeared.  This all happened in less then 2 minutes.

Hovered)) for a little while it moved left it moved right then just kind of went down slow beyond the trees.  It had to be 5 miles away at least.  My dog was going nuts trying to run away so I took her inside when I ran back outside I never saw it again.;39.7842676056337;-89.671866197183
Red ball steadily across night sky followed by second one 4 min later;2018-07-21 21:03:00;1 minute;Red ball steadily across night sky followed by second one 4 min later Reddish flaming light ball moved steadily across sky as wife and friends sitting on back deck.  Moved from west to south in the night sky.  No green light nor any kind of flashing lights.   About 4 minutes later, a second one going about the same speed goes by using similar path.   Interesting ... the ISS went by exacting hour later.  What we saw earlier was very much different.  I originally thought it was a meteor, but ruled it out when the second one went by.  In my 40 years watching the sky since I was a kid, I never saw anything like it.;39.7842676056337;-89.671866197183
