Strange orange lights reported over Springfield, Illinois.;2013-07-13 21:00:00;unknown;Strange orange lights reported over Springfield, Illinois. I did not personally see these craft. I am a dispatcher for Sangamon County 911 and tonight we received 2 separate calls regarding orange lights flying in different formations westbound in the sky.   This is the 3rd call I have taken reference similar craft in the last two weeks.   An officer responded and nothing was found.   I talked to the airport and they had nothing in the area at that time.   I also contacted the National Weather Service and they were not reporting any strange weather.  Callers advised the lights as 4-6 orange balls changing formation and headed in a  southwestern direction.;39.7842676056337;-89.671866197183
Fast moving v formation high in the night sky.;2021-04-14 21:15:00;5 seconds;Fast moving v formation high in the night sky. I was looking up at the stars and just happened to see a very faint movement in the sky. Once my eyes focused, I could see what looked like a formation of very faint lights in a formation. I would say it was a v formation but it was more of a check mark as there were more to one side than the other, about 7 or 8 lights in total. They moved faster than any aircraft I’ve ever seen flying at what seemed such high altitude. I’ve seen shooting start, satellites, meteors and all sorts of aircraft flying in the night sky. Nothing I’ve seen has ever moved the way these lights were moving. I’m 100% convinced I saw either one big ufo or a cluster of multiple ufos.;39.7842676056337;-89.671866197183
