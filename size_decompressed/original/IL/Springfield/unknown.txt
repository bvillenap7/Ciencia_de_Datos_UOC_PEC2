I had a close encounter with an unknown shaped craft.  The craft gave off a loud, deep, oscillating, electro-acoustic, bass, humming sound that came from the sky.  The bass from the craft oscillated slowly and became louder and deeper and began to shake me and the ground.  The craft came very close during the encounter and appeared to be on the ground in front of me and another approximately 40yrds away.  I do not know if it was the same craft in the sky or something different that approached the two of us.  I could go further into what happened next, but I will reserve the right not to continue.   I will say this, if I could of saw what approached the two of us I probably would not have stuck around.  I am glad I did because I know that there is more out there than meets the eye.;39.7842676056337;-89.671866197183
A light appeared out of no where at night during a drive-in movie.  Went straight a little then curved dramatically, ~90 degrees.;2015-07-10 00:45:00;Short;A light appeared out of no where at night during a drive in movie, went straight a little then curved dramatically as much as a 90 degr I was at the drive-in movies.  Next to Knights action park in Springfield IL.  I was watching the new Terminator movie, and behind the screen, nowhere close to being on the screen,  I saw a light show up out of no where.  Now, I at first thought it could be a shooting star or  satellite dish (sic.  Satellite), but before it disappeared behind the screen out of view, it curved dramatically.  At least 90 degrees and as far as I know.  Shooting stars and  satellite dishes (sic. Satellite)  cannot make a turn that big.   I was sitting in the front row next to my mom and dad, though neither of them saw it.  But there were a lot more people there watching the movie, so I'm sure someone saw it too.  Another thing was that it showed up out of no where then because the screen was in the way I don't know where it went.  It was a glowing white in color.   I'm 16 years old and I have seen shooting stars before.  This was nothing like one.   And in my opinion I believe there is life else where.  I'd just never thought I would be reporting something like this.   I don't know how to any more explain what I saw.   I am not positive the exact time but it was around 12:30 to 1 am.;39.7842676056337;-89.671866197183
