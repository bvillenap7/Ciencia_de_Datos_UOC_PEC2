U.F.O, Seen while driving home.;1999-06-29 12:50:00;40 second's;U.F.O, Seen while driving home. On my way home today while driving down the street i was watching a big white jet flying across the sky. Well the reason I was watching it was because of these huge contrail's behind it. When i noticed a airplane. that resembled a space shuttle. And coming right toward's the spaceshuttle loking airplane was a cigar shaped object. The colors were actually not color but like a dark moving metal with some reflection to it. I wanted to pull over but there was to much trafic. When I turned the corner and looked back up it was gone but the shuttle was still flying. this all happend around 12:50, it was very ecxiting.;39.7842676056337;-89.671866197183
Objects seen during daytime, moving, hovering, and changing color.;2005-04-17 15:00:00;3 minutes;Objects seen during daytime, moving, hovering, and changing color. 2 - 3 white/grey objects were seen during daylight on a clear day.  They were apparently at a very high altitude as they were quite small compared to jets in the area.  They appeared as elongated shapes and changed back & forth from white to grey.   They would move back & forth, in straight lines, at times stopping and remaining in the same spot.  They would disappear and reappear in different places in the same general area.  This lasted for about 2 - 3 minutes and then they were no longer observed.;39.7842676056337;-89.671866197183
