((HOAX??))  Witnessed a bright, disk shaped object seen flying from the sky to the ground at at close range. (Photos Taken);2007-02-12 15:00:00;5 mintues;((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that this may be a hoax.  Note discrepancy in time.  We have written the source of the report, requesting clarification, and a copy of the alleged photo.  PD)) Witnessed a bright, disk shaped object seen flying from the sky to the ground at at close range. (Photos Taken) I was driving west from Rochester on Rochester Rd toward Lake Springfield.  When I reached the stop sign, there was a very bright light shining inside my car.  It was like a spot light from a police car.  I looked behind me and did not see a police car or any other vehicle.  I looked up and saw an orange light in the sky that wasn’t moving. At a steady speed it came from a couple miles up to ground level in approximately 5 seconds.  It hovered over the ground about a 100ft away.  The craft looked like it was the length of a city bus.  I could see the grass moving as it rotated.  It stayed there for less than a minute. When it was at ground level the lights dimmed, and I could see the craft rotating horizontally like a wheel with blue colored lights blinking around it with white light coming off of it.  It turned brighter and the grass was moving faster. It lifted and turned about 80 degrees and took off about 3 times faster than it came down. As it took off, the craft was a very, very bright blue. The whole craft was shining brighter than a light bulb, more like magnesium burning. When it left, my radio started going nuts. It stopped working. My car wasn’t running. There wasn’t even a light on my tape adapter (for CD). This shows I didn’t even have the battery working. After the craft left, my car would not start for 1 minute. A minute later it came back on by itself and the radio did. I didn’t have to turn the key to start it. I was able to take pictures of the craft (with my cell phone) as it was coming in, when it landed, and when it took off. The whole event seemed to take place in less than five minutes. I am concerned that I felt fatigued when the ‘spotlight’ was on my car.  I also have very little recollection on how I was able to travel from the location the sighting took place in Rochester and ended up outside the Muni property by the lake.  I have no memory of this.;39.7842676056337;-89.671866197183
Ball of light flicks out, reappears and explods into many balls of light that form a circle in the sky.;2007-11-05 19:41:00;10 Sec;Ball of light flicks out, reappears and explodes into many balls of light that form a circle in the sky. Tonight on my way to pick up My sibling at the High School I was traveling North towards Dawson. A light to the Northeast caught my eye.  It looked like a big star or the space station. I am interested in these paranormal things so I continued to watch it. It suddenly disappeared and reappeared a little way to the right of the original location. Surprised by this i pulled the truck over to continue watching. Suddenly the ball of light exploded into about ten balls of light.  These all then collected into one ring that started to move.  It stayed like this for about ten seconds then the lights went out. Due to ambient light i was still able to see the craft though.  It was metallic, but looked like a motherboard in texture.  I watched it of a couple more seconds before it too was gone. I called multiple people to tell them what i saw.  Only when I got home about ten minutes later and got out of the truck did it hit me that this was real.  The Springfield military base had scrambled multiple f-16's that were now on patrol around the city. Whatever this was it showed up on radar.... Later I received a message that there were 2-3 helicopters circling Springfield.  Obviously our military base was worried about something. F-16's don't get scrambled for nothing nor to helicopters. Something happened tonight and I hope to find out what it was. It was not.... A weather balloon A Jet A Crashing plane / helicopter A Reflected beam of light A firework  It was a(n)... Anomaly Advanced Flying vehicle   I know what  I saw and I would swear under oath that what I just said was true.

Wife and I walked out front to smoke.  We both notice an object that appeared to be on fire as it flew through the air.   As we watch this object, flames subdued and was dropping into tree down the road.  I went to see if it may have been a pilot that escaped his jet but did not see anything at the location.;39.7842676056337;-89.671866197183

It's a beautiful clear day here today, and I noticed that the sky was really blue for a change.  So I was just staring up in amazement.   I look towards the east and it looked like birds circling around, but upon second glance, I noticed a pin sized light in each object.  There were roughly 10-15 objects.  As I watched, they continued flying in circular formation, criss crossing one another, at the same time rising higher and higher. I ran inside to grab my phone and tried to record it, but when I got back out, (literally 3 seconds later) the objects were so high in the sky I could barely see them anymore.  My camera could not detect anything.  I continued watching them move up, and a little southeast until they finally disappeared completely. All of this happened within the timeframe of 1 minute, just minutes past the 3 o'clock hour, central time.;39.7842676056337;-89.671866197183
