Daytime sighting of an unknown object following the vapor trail of passing commercial jet.;2007-05-12 14:30:00;1 minute;Daytime sighting of an unknown object following the vapor trail of passing commercial jet. The location of this sighting was the same as the 4/17/05 reported sighting, the UIS soccer fields, and it again occurred during daylight hours.  It was a very clear day with blue skies and little to no clouds, in the middle of the afternoon.  My 7-year old daughter and I had just finished shooting a model rocket several times and had no more engines left, so we sat down under some trees to relax before making the walk back to our car. My daughter joked that perhaps we would see a UFO since I had spotted some unknown object(s) in the sky at the same place, roughly two years ago, when we'd been flying kites. It, unfortunately, has become a family joke.  As we sat under the trees, she joked about some flying insects being UFOs and pointed to a passing jet or two. After a minute or so, she pointed and said, What is that white ball following that jet? I looked at the commercial jet that was flying overhead, and there was what appeared to be a ball of white vapor alongside the jet's vapor trail.  This ball of what appeared to be white smoke or vapor was about the same width as the jet itself, or perhaps a little wider.  The odd thing was that this ball appeared to be following the jet. It did not stay stationary in the sky as if it were just part of the vapor trail. Instead, it followed alongside the vapor trail behind the jet, traveling at what appeared to be the same speed as the jet, maintaining a constant distance.  We both stood up and walked out from under the trees to watch this object follow the jet until they both disappeared into the distance and out of view in the western sky. We were facing east when the jet and object were approaching, heading west.  I am a highly educated individual with a Masters degree, married with 2 daughters.;39.7842676056337;-89.671866197183
I saw one lightbulb shaped craft extremely up close and several other red orbs.;2013-07-04 21:30:00;7 minutes;I saw one lightbulb shaped craft extremely up close and several other red orbs. 	The UFO I saw was about 70 feet away and 20 feet above the ground.It was dark orange and the material the UFO was made out of emitted a bright orange light. The structure of the UFO was comparable to a upside down light-bulb. At the bottom of the UFO there was a single hole that i could see inside the craft through, the hole was also emitting red-orange light with a ball of red-orange light that was positioned at the center of the hole in the UFO without struts or bars attached to it.  I heard the trees moving and I looked to my left near the top of the trees at my home and saw the UFO hovering behind the tree. The UFO then slowly moved at a speed around 10 mph to the end of my street. I yelled to my girlfriend who was beside me to look and I pointed at the UFO. The UFO immediately started hovering higher and moving away from my location at around 30 MPH and gradually built up speed and rose higher until it was no longer visible. 	After seeing the UFO, two of my friends and I were watching the skies for the UFO in case it returned. We watched for about an hour and noticed six other red orbs in different locations in the sky, Three of the six orbs were flying individually. The other three orbs were in a triangular formation and flying in the same direction as if part of the same aircraft.;39.7842676056337;-89.671866197183
Lights in the sky.;2017-12-09 21:00:00;5 minutes;Lights in the sky My husband and i were getting out of our car and walking to the house, when I looked up and saw a sequence of four lights in a row. It was in the east.  They were flashing from left to right.  I've never seen any plane or helicopter do anything like this.  They looked like chaser lights on a bar way up.   I told my husband about the strange lights that weren't moving and he didn't look, he went into the house.  I watched for a few more minutes, then kind of blew it off until now.  To know others may have saw something that night is why I'm coming forward.;39.7842676056337;-89.671866197183

They did not move but after no more that 2 minutes, most were gone.  They just disappeared leaving 4 or 5.  Shortly after,  those were gone, too. There were no blinking or colored lights.  They just looked like stars.  There was no sound.;39.7842676056337;-89.671866197183
