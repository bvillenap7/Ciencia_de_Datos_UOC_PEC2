My friend aslo witnessed this event. I was crossing the road to deliever my friend his cloths he left at my house.I look up and see this egg or sphere shaped craft that even though it was night was fully visible.I stood there in the middle of the road as this craft moves slowely till out of sight.I was scared because it appeared again.This time it gained in size,only to get smaller and disappear for good.A few minutes later my friend calls and tells me that he saw a strange flying craft in the sky.Then i knew something was up.The craft I remembered was small,slow, had the color of head lights, and was egg shaped.I remember everything.;39.7842676056337;-89.671866197183
