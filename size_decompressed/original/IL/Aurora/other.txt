I went out to get my newspaper in the driveway and looked up at the sky to enjoy the stars.  Over my house, a faint bow-shaped glow (bluish in color) glided by going north to south. It was in view for 5-10 seconds.  There was no sound. I tried to rationalize it thinking it was perhaps a large bird and that some lighting was reflecting off the front edge of the wings.  The more I thought about it, I couldn’t think of a bird in our area large enough to glide by with this effect.  The herons & egrets in the area keep flapping their wings when they fly, so it couldn’t have been one of them since what I saw was a steady movement.  It wasn’t Canadian Geese in formation either.  Also, the object appeared quite large, so if it was a bird and it appeared that large to me, it would’ve been flying very low and I should’ve been able to see the body to some extent. Since I could see no other part of the figure, I assume the object was at a pretty high altitude. If I’m correct in that assumption, then the object was quite large.  After the object disappeared, I extended my arm and with my thumb and forefinger I approximated the size.  The object from tip to tip of the bow (crescent?) was about an inch and a half spread of my thumb and forefinger with my arm extended.
