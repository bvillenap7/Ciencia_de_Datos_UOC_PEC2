Large, bright, amber, flaring light over Aurora, IL;2009-09-02 22:00:00;several minutes;Large, bright, amber, flaring light over Aurora, IL My adult son and I were taking a late-night walk when we both noticed, almost at the same time, a strange light in the sky.  I say strange because neither of us had ever seen anything like it before.  It was significantly bigger than a typical airplane or helicopter light it was amber orange in color it was very bright in the cloudless sky, even with the full moon it did not have a well-defined outline &#8211 more like a flaring ball of plasma than a solid circle it was a steady light, with no flashing or strobing.  The speed seemed to be about the speed of an airplane. When we first looked up, we were afraid because we thought a plane was on fire.  But it was traveling in a deliberate, straight line, going in a SW direction, approximately 45 degrees up from the ground.  We could not discern how high up it was but the size made us think it must not have been at a high altitude.  We heard no noise from the object.  It never veered from its course but c! ontinued on in the same direction the whole time.  At some point, our vision was obscured by trees in the distance, but the object did not reappear from out of the line of distant trees.  It seemed to have disappeared.  We looked for it for a long time afterward but saw nothing.  At the point where it had been obscured by the trees, it was still visibly large to us, so we doubt that it simply got too small to see in that short a time.  The entire sighting took several minutes as it went from the NE sky (where we first spotted it) to the SW where it seemed to have disappeared after our vision was blocked by the tall, distant trees.  We saw airplanes flying over the same general area both before and after we saw the amber light.  Seeing them right after the amber light confirmed to us how different they were.

Sequencial Lights Disappearing at the Same Location in the Sky.  ((Starlink satellites?));2019-12-22 18:38:00;7 minutes;Sequencial Lights Disappearing at the Same Location in the Sky See a lot of airplanes fly overhead toward Ohare and Midway.  Initially thought of multiple airplanes traveling on the same IFR, until I noticed the lights never blinked.  Somewhere between 20 and 25 lights were spaced approximately the same distance apart and were traveling in the same direction.  At one location in the sky the lights would becoming dimmer until they disappeared.  They all disappeared at the same physical location in the sky. I could not capture video because my camera could not focus on the dim lights.;41.7623329710145;-88.2844521739129
We were in the backyard BBQing and looked up in the sky and seen a line of bright lights very high ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-26 21:00:00;1 minute;We were in the backyard BBQing and looked up in the sky and seen a line of bright lights very high in the sky going southeast.  They were individual round lights that were moving across the sky faster than a normal plane in a straight line formation. I tried to take a photo of what we saw but my phone started acting up it would not go to camera mode.  Then when I looked up to take the picture the round lights just disappeared without a trace.;41.7623329710145;-88.2844521739129
Line of possible UFO's sighted over Aurora IL, USA.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-26 21:23:00;:45 seconds;Line of possible UFO's sighted over Aurora IL, USA While walking my dog tonight, I noticed how brilliant the stars were!  Clear night.  As I gazed at the stars, I noticed what appeared to be a perfect line of stars... spaced exactly the same distance apart...but they were MOVING!  I kept thinking my eyes were playing tricks on me, knowing that stars don't travel.  But the line was moving.  There was no noise.  They appeared like bright stars in the sky...seemed quite a distance up.  It felt like hours, but in reality is was probably 45 seconds to a minute before they just started to fade away.  Just disappeared into the ethers.  I have never witnessed anything like it in my life.  There were probably 8-10 of them in the line.  I did attempt to shoot video, but the video is black.  Perhaps it could be blown up to see if any detail can be extracted.  If you would like to have it, I'm happy to provide it.;41.7623329710145;-88.2844521739129
