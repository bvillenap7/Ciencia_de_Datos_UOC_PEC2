Resident spotted a still aircraft at low altitude on 3/5/2015 at 7:30 pm. in Aurora, Illinois.;2015-03-05 19:30:00;5+ minutes;Resident spotted a still aircraft at low altitude on 3/5/2015 at 7:30 pm. in Aurora, Illinois. Looking west spotted a still air craft.  The shape was circular with a bright light and several lime green lights that were constant and not flashing.  There were 3 airplanes that moved in the air so it was easy to see the difference in movement and altitude.  One airplane flew northeast and then abruptly turned northwest.  Did not see the still craft leave but checked 2 hours later and it was no longer visible.;41.7623329710145;-88.2844521739129

They would move slow in different directions and disappear.  Then it looked like 3 moved into each other and disappeared.   We were looking high into the east sky if that helps.  Still light outside.

It was floating around terrifyingly quickly, almost as if it was trying to hide.  I was trying to convince myself that it was a plane, but then I remembered that planes usually have colorful blinking light, move in a straight line, and are slower.  It was therefore clear to me that this was not a star. I tried to watch it as close as I could, and I followed it with my eyes, until a tree covered my view.  I went around the tree, still staring up at the sky I  search of the mysterious object, but I never found it.  The last few things I remember are that the object was round, almost shaped like a star.  It even twinkled.  But it was just so fast, and moved so strangely, I'm absolutely positive that this was a UFO. Unfortunately, I was the only witness this phenomenon.  However, my cousins were there when this happened.  I tried to show them, but they dismissed it as a mere shooting star.  I'm sure it was a UFO, though. Please keep in mind that I am a mere child, and that I would not like to receive any mail to my address.  Sorry for any inconvenience.  However, I do accept voicemails and emails. I cannot receive calls since I am almost always busy.  I do hope that my age does not interfere with any thing, as I am thoroughly astounded by the experience that I went through. Thank you for your time. Warm Regards, ((girl's name deleted));41.7623329710145;-88.2844521739129
