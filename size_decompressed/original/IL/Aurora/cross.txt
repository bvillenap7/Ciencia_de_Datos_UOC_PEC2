((HOAX??))  I seen a Cross shaped figure in the somewhat dark sky..  ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  PD));2006-06-09 19:00:00;15-19 Mins;I seen a Cross shaped figure in the somewhat dark sky.. I was coming out of Luigis Pizza after a good birthday party and I was waiting for my dad to come out, as I was waiting I looked up into the somewhat dark sky and seen a cross formation of lights moving in one direction then it changed directions and went the other way as if it was patroling the area for something, the lights on the outter part of the cross were solid white and all the other lights were pulsating red, I watched it for about 17 minutes and I looked to see if my dad had come out yet but he hasn't so I looked back up to the craft and just as I did the craft turned auround and it looked as if it was landing, it was in fact getting closer but then it pointed the nose of the ship straight up and took off. The craft was very large in size about 40 ft from front to back and 60 ft wingspan.. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible hoax??  PD));41.7623329710145;-88.2844521739129
