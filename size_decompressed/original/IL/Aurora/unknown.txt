Looking Straight up one appears at about 11:00 o'clock. Another, even briighter appears at abbout 1:00 o'clock. I saw another approach from the south & was very bright then just disappeared. These are almst in line with bright star in west at about 3:00 o'clock. See several other less bright objects near them. These objects look like satellites in the sky. No shape to them & look like stars. These objects hover, move up and down, zig zag etc. They stay in place then make rapid movements like I described. I thought my eyes were playing tricks with me, but my wife witnessed them also. I like to watch for satellites at night, and i thought the one at 1:00 o'clock was a satellite, but the movemnt on this was crazy! The one that disappeared was spooky. I am sober and live 40 miles west of Chicago. If possible have someone else look and confirm.;41.7623329710145;-88.2844521739129
Shiny Object near Aurora, IL;2006-11-07 17:00:00;30 seconds;Shiny Object near Aurora, IL I came home from work at approx. 5 pm. Walked to back of house (facing north) to talk to wife and kids. They were outback on this partly sunny day.  I was talking with her and looked up to the slight west (about 3 miles west of RT. 59) and saw a very shiny object stationary and silent in the air about level with the clouds, which were spuratic in the sky. This shiny object was hovering in an open area of the sky in between two sets of clouds.  I thought that it was very odd, so I staired at object for about 20-30 seconds, when I turned to my wife to continue the conversation. I interrupted our chat to tell her to look up, and when we did, the object was gone.  I did not notice any trails that it may have left, and all I can say for sure is that it was about 1000 feet up and it was probably silver and round in shape. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and we found him to be quite serious-minded and credible.  We suspect that he is a very good witness.  PD));41.7623329710145;-88.2844521739129
Slow bright light, no sonic sound and turned sharply and light turned red and disappeared;2009-09-23 20:00:00;30 seconds;Slow bright light, no sonic sound and turned sharply and light turned red and disappeared At approximately 8 PM Central time, I went outside to smoke a cigarette and as usual I look up at the stars. I saw a very bright light, I figured it was a star until I realized it was moving slowly, thinking it was a plane I tracked its course and realized it wasn’t making any residual sonic noises associated with planes. I have lived in Aurora Illinois for 5 or so years and have watched out skies every night it was clear. I star gaze and look for constellations. This light moved slowly, about the rate of a plane, but there were no blinking lights like on most planes and the spotlight was facing straight down, then it moved east and dimmed and the light turned a pinpoint red and disappeared. I don’t know what I saw but it if it was a plane it was really quiet and it turned like no other plane I have seen in my 45 years.;41.7623329710145;-88.2844521739129
Unaccountable anomaly in the night sky. Please read.;2011-10-15 21:00:00;~20 seconds;Unaccountable anomaly in the night sky. Please read. This occurred many years ago and had I known I would have shared my story here. Believe me if you would like to or not, but I am blessed to have witnessed such cosmic wonder and mystery. My friend and myself went to pick up another friend at his house. We exited the vehicle and I, being an amateur astronomer, took notice of the sky (It was a clear night as I observed Orion) as we waited for him to open his side door.  Minutes later he emerges and we walk back to the car, approximately 60 feet around a corner to a dead end where we had parked.  A cigarette is smoked along the way and we wait outside the vehicle until it has been finished. It was at this moment when a sudden, intense flash of light was produced with no noise.  Akin to a lightning bolt when you are near the center of a severe storm, except much stronger.  The whole area was illuminated as if it was day for a brief second.  We looked at each other since we were spooked. I looked skywards and saw what was a small cloud growing larger slightly above our heads at the level of a very low cloud. It changed color from gray to blue to a dark green/purple to yellow and back to gray.  As it grew in size, there were small orbs or spheres of light moving inside of this cloud they would never hit each other and would disappear inside the cloud. As the cloud grew in size, more of these orbs appeared.  Within the cloud there were small lightning bolts that would appear, never hitting the orbs. It grew to a considerable size above us in a matter of a few seconds before out of sheer terror and my grasp of physics/reality turned upside down that I collapsed to me feet trying to hide on the side of the car.  I stared up again and it was gone. My friend who also frequently stayed out at night hours for considerable amounts of time also reported seeing a flash of light and colors in the sky in that direction.  I attempted to perform an investigation in the days after but unsurprisingly nothing was found. My best bet and extensive research into various sciences has led me to believe this is an interdimensional anomaly, but we always end up finding what we are looking for. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));41.7623329710145;-88.2844521739129
6 strange lights that appeared to be operating as one but at the same time, independently.;2019-11-07 18:58:00;7 minutes;6 strange lights that appeared to be operating as one but at the same time, independently. Driving home from the gym, I saw 6 unknown craft in the sky.  They split off into two pairs of three.  As I turned towards home, I noticed one craft gliding through the sky.  As I continued to drive, it was obvious the craft was picking up speed.  Planes are not allowed that close to each other nor can than hover and change diresction the way these did.;41.7623329710145;-88.2844521739129
