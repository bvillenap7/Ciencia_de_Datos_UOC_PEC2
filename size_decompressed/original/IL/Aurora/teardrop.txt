It was shape like a horse shoe crab, only not so wide.  Like a teardrop, only horizontal.  It was glowing with purple, pink, and bluish, overflowing colors.  It had a tail.  It disappeared shortly.  It was very beautiful glow and terrifying.  Iâ€™ve never seen anything like that before.  I was on my bicycle.
