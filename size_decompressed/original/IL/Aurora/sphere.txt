Black / opaque/ silent sphere transversing the evening sky;2010-06-06 20:10:00;5-8 min;Black / opaque/ silent sphere transversing the evening sky The evening of June 6th at 20:10-20:18, I witnessed a black spherical object to the east towards the flight paths of Ohare and Midway airports.   Initially though it was a nearby mylar balloon ascending in the evening wind.  Upon observing, I realized it was considerably more distant because a light aircraft landing nearby at a community field eclipsed the object and based on the size I would have estimated it to be much closer if it was a free-ranging balloon.  Still skeptical, I observed and noticed the sphere ascending slowly to the south at a steady rate.  A faint fuzziness existed around its perimeter. I photographed the sky using a blackberry camera phone such that each frame should encompass the sphere.  To my amazement the object passed behind a thin but opaque cloud during the observation period.  This then confirmed that it was much higher and further away than a mylar balloon or facsimile.  The object maintained its altitude (estimated ~2000-3000 ft).  The presence of numerous jets landing and small private aircraft preclude the notion of a misidentification of a plane as a black/opaque sphere.  Six images were taken as it progressed southward to ultimately disappear.  I am posting this observation in response to seeing NUFORC reports of similar  in the vicinity.;41.7623329710145;-88.2844521739129
