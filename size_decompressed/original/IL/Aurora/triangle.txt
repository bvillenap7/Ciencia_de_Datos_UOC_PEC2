A series of 3 lights in a trianbular shape under the craft. It was silent and slow moving. It came out of the northwest and was traveling south east at about 35 to 40 miles per hour. I was traveling home form work on I 88 west bound out of Chicago at about 9:00pm. Around Naperville road I noticed a line of lights in the distance about 20 degrees off to the right of the highway. It was very low in the sky. It was not in the flight path of either O Hare or Midway airport. As I continued west bound I realized that what ever it was would be passing directly over head in a few moments. As I came closer to it, I noticed that what seemed like a line of nine lights was a series of three triangles with three sets of lights in each. I slowed to 25 to 30 miles per hour as it passed directly overhead. There was no sound as it passed over the highway. The lights were to bright to allow any sighting of the craft itself, although the outline of the configuration of the lights suggested that the craft was V shaped wing. The altitude is only a approximation. If it were higher in the sky then it would be of a larger size, if it were lower it would be slightly smaller. I have flown ultralight aircraft and no a little about determining altitude from the ground level persective. Other cars had slowed down and were also looking up as it passed dircectly overhead. It traveled towards the very populated Naperville area.;41.7623329710145;-88.2844521739129
