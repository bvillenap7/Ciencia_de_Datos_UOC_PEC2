Large meteor. Greenish color at head. Sparkling tail, golden-flecked. Traveling in arching trajectory West to East out of sight.;1999-11-16 18:05:00;7-10 sec.;Large meteor. Greenish color at head. Sparkling tail, golden-flecked. Traveling in arching trajectory West to East out of sight. Random sighting while driving in auto. Altitude unknown, but it seemed to be at same height as local cirrus clouds in area. Arched trajectory possibly from WNW to ESE. Definite green tint on head of object with a sparkling gold hued tail. It appeared to be breaking up as it passed from sight. However, I am not a skilled observer and I know that many people in Chicagoland area were calling local radio stations. Later callers from other nearby states called in as well. Countless persons had to have seen this.;41.7623329710145;-88.2844521739129
Husband and wife witness strange floating firey object over Aurora, IL sky;2012-06-23 23:00:00;2 minutes;Husband and wife witness strange floating firey object over Aurora, IL sky My wife and I were out on the back patio when an odd colored firey light cought her attention.  At first it looked to me as if it was a large meteor.  Right before I opened my mouth to give that answer to my wife it stopped in the clounds and began to wobble a little to the left and right.  The movements were very speratic.  Then it stopped and stood completely still in the clouds for a little over a minute.  The object then did a couple more small wobbles back and forth and the light sputtered out. And it seemed to slowely travel away from us and faded into the clouds.  We continued to sit and observe the general direction of the sky for another 15 minutes with nothing else to be seen.  The Object seemed to be engulfed in flames.  The color was a semi bright yellow at the bottom blending into a light orange towards the top.  It reminded me of a candle flame or a meteor.  When we first viewed the object it seemed to have a fire trail greatly resembling a meteor but much larger and closer then I have seen before.  Upon slowing down and stopping in mid air it held the colors in a flickering fashion the entire viewing time until it fizzled out.  Much like a match at the end of the stick.  The objects general shape appeared to look alot like the general depicted view of a UFO flying saucer.  It was a rather blurry outline due to the color and its position in the clouds.  The base was saucer-like in appearance with a larger dome shape in the top.  The size of the object appeared to be about two 747 passenger jets stacked on top of each other.;41.7623329710145;-88.2844521739129
Fireball-like object seen in Aurora, IL;2012-07-04 22:45:00;2 minutes;Fireball-like object seen in Aurora, IL Ok, I am well aware it was July 4th and anything in the sky is suspect, but about 10 minutes after Aurora's fireworks show, my girlfriend and I saw a large orange ball, that didn't seem very far away, move at a steady pace from west to east, then suddenly disappear. There aren't any fireworks that I know of able to showcase that kind of control.  We stared at it, then looked at each other and both said &quotHoly s%$*, a UFO.&quot  Across the street (about 50 feet away) we heard another person say the same thing, so we weren't the only ones.  We were sitting on Indian Trail facing north, directly across from IMSA.   Please, I would like to know if any one else reported this so I know I'm not crazy.  The time I put down is approximate.  I don't really remember looking at my phone for the time.  It didn't even occur to me to at least attempt to take a picture, even though it wouldn't really show anything definitive.;41.7623329710145;-88.2844521739129

Three orange lights in formation.;2013-03-08 20:15:00;20 seconds;Three orange lights in formation I was driving on Ogden Avenue in Aurora, Illinois at 8:15PM on Friday March 8, 2013.  As usual, there were a number of planes in the air traveling west to east as the landing path for Chicago Midway Airport passes directly overhead.  The planes typically have a white light with blue and red flashing lights on the wings. As I was driving, I looked out of my car window to the north and there were three very bright orange objects in the sky.  The objects were traveling east to west, the opposite direction of the plane traffic.  They were at a lower altitude than the planes and were bunched together traveling in a line at the same speed.  They appeared to be very low flying planes, but they were too close to each other and not the right color to be planes.  After a few seconds the leading object changed direction and started moving in a northerly direction while the other two continued in the westerly direction.  When the first object changed direction it appeared to have fire coming out of it.  Within ten seconds they were out of my view after continuing on their respective paths (2 to the west and 1 to the north) at a high rate of speed.  I am not a trained eye, but the objects appeared to be airplane sized, traveled at low altitude and were moving at least as fast as the planes in the sky if! not faster. The lights were significant enough that the traffic in front of me on a very busy highway stopped to look at them nearly causing a traffic accident.  The skies here are very congested with planes flying into Oâ€™Hare and Midway, medical helicopters and private planes from several local airports, but these did not have any of the characteristics of a plane or helicopter and clearly stood out as people were stopping to look at them.;41.7623329710145;-88.2844521739129
