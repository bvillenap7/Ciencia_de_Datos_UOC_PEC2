As of two yea;1999-02-03 17:00:00;1 hour;In the 70's when I was a little girl, there were 3 in a triangle formation.  After all this time I have tried to forget.  As of two years ago (including tonight) I see at least two/three bobbing bright lights that I know are related to what I saw as a child. My husband and I last saw them July 1998 until tonight.  They gradually disappear out of view as if they just vanish in an instant. About 7 p.m. I was walking from the frontroom into the kitchen area.  I noticed through the window (facing the West) a very bright light that I have continuously seen all through my life.  I didn't want to scare my children so I had my husband look into the night sky. There were two of them off into the West sky, one close to the other. They were turning around and around and the lights of the two were a bright white and then green sparkle shimmer.  They were constantly bobbing around which I assume is because of communication. We watched for a while and after about an hour they started to phase out of sight and eventually were gone. They always appear in that area and have since I've been a child. My one child claimed to me that in the middle of the night he was awoken by bright lights by his window. I don't want him to be scared like what I have been all these years, so I told him it was just probably car lights coming off the road. This is something I've held onto for many years now and I know it's not aircraft...it's UFO's.;42.4751;-89.6458
