The object was coming out of the  north traveling due south at approx. 2000 feet. The object appeared to traveling maybe 60mph. slow..it flew directly over our position , we ran outside and watched it travel directly overhead.. i could hear a very faint low rumble. The lighting configuration was unlike anything ive seen before . Down the middle of object appeared 3 red lights spaced out in line,surrounding the lights were 4 white lights in large square , all blinking. The object was large around 100 feet long , couldnt make out outline of craft.. because of unusual light configuration ,wasnt triangle. It appeared to be flying square, or possibly a capital I shape., very strange.;39.4581;-88.8057

It looked to be on fire.  Green and yellow and I would see pointed ends.  It was going in front of my car in a downward direction and we looked to our left to see where it was going to crash but it didn't.  The light of it went out before hitting earth.  We don't know what it was,  At first I thought it was an aircraft that was on fire and going to crash.  We heard no sound from it.;39.4581;-88.8057
