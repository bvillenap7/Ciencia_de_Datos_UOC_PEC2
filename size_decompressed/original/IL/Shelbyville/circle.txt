Bright light, faster than a jet.;2014-08-24 19:50:00;45 seconds;Bright light, faster than a jet. While my boyfriend and I were outside on our back deck, he pointed behind me and said, what is that?.   I look over and I see a bright white, circular, light.  It was moving faster than a jet and it wasn't leaving a chemical trail.   I asked him if he could hear any sound, because I couldn't, and he agreed he could not either.   On further inspection we did see four small flashing lights around the one bright light.  Almost like the flashing lights on the wings of planes.   As I say, it was moving faster than a jet, so it could not have been a plane, and the light was extremely bright.   It came out of the east and disappeared into the clouds to the west of us.;39.4581;-88.8057
