Upon leaving work from the 700 block of Dillon Dr. in Wood Dale, IL at 12:15pm on November 7th, 2006,  A former co-worker and myself witnessed several hovering objects over O'Hare International Airport. They appeared to be white in color and made no noise and hovered in one area the entire duration. At one point two of the objects actually bounced off of each other. They were about the size of a helicopter from our vantage point. The objects were still within sight upon my leaving the area at approx. 12:30pm.;41.9574;-87.9808
