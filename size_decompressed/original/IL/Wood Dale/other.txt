It wasnt moving but hoovering..motionless. It could have been even slowly rotating. It was thin..but.huge. I went to my car in the company parking lot..after work, and saw airplanes descending in flight patterns toward Ohare Airport. I entered my car and drove eventually in a westerly direction which would have been perpendicular to where one of the planes would have been as it descended very low toward runway paths.  From my car as I drove, I turned to view this extremely huge aircraft. It was very low to ground..only a couple of blocks up.  It was much, much larger than a 747...It looked man-made..but what caught my attention even more..was that it wasnt moving...It seemed to be fixed in one position...almost as if it was some kind of 'platform'.  It was well lit...It even seemed to be slowly rotating...It was shaped similar to a very thin fusalage with very long wings. I cant remember if it had any engines..I dont remember seeing any.  I slowed my driving, but for some reason, I didnt stop..and finally the aircraft went out of view.  I definitely felt I had seen something futuristic..but it didnt seem to be a spacecraft.  It looked as if it was some kind of a huge bomber or observation vehicle.  And, again....it didnt move..and it made no sounds.  I think it even cast a shadow on the homes below from its own colored and white lights....Thats all I remember.;41.9574;-87.9808
