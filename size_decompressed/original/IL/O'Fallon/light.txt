As I was walking towards my car (at 7:31pm) which is parked right next to a lake, I decided to look up at the stars since it was a clear and dark sky (perfect conditions for star watching). I was about to drive myself to the market. Accordingly, I noticed a few very bright stars when suddenly, one of them started to move slowly towards the moon (crecent moon, I believe). The star slightly changed direcction (it didn't fly in a straight pattern) until it's own light vanished into the dark skies. I kept looking for it, but it totally disappeared from the sky view (which is completely strange for a star). Now, I work for the military and I have seen plenty of planes, helicopters, and other types of aircraft and this was absolutely no known man made aircraft, at least not to my knowledge. I only report this incident in order to keep record of this fascinating event, and to share it with others.;38.5684597402596;-89.8966575757576
