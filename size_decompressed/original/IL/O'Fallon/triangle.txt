Watched Triangular Object Hover Over My Barn For At Least 5 Minutes;2000-12-05 00:00:00;5-6 minutes;Watched Triangular Object Hover Over My Barn For At Least 5 Minutes I just arrived home late at night and as I parked in front of the barn at the end of the driveway I noticed two lights in the air, no more than 50 feet above the roof of the barn.  I assumed it was a plane coming in to land at the local Air Force Base (Scott AFB)and proceded to gather my things from the back seat of the car.  About 20 to 30 seconds later I turned back towards the windshield and was about to get out of the car when I noticed that the lights had not moved - at all.  This occurance went against my intuitive understanding of the laws of physics, being that objects very close to the ground, such as this one in particular, move across the field of view much quicker than objects that are further from the ground... right?  So I watched this thing hover for the next 3 minutes totally motionless over my barn. Honestly I was scared out of my mind.  I was afraid that at any minute I would get beamed up or something.  I couldn't stop watching though I had to figure out an explanation.  Then a third light came on so that total there were now 3 white lights forming a triangle.  I unrolled my window to listen for any noise and there was none.  Absolute silence.  It was unreal!  I didn't think anyone would believe me, but the next day the whole town was talking about the UFO that was sighted and documented by the police because even THEY had seen it!

Since it was at night, I saw only the lights. There was one large red light in the middle that blinked and slightly smaller white lights forming a triangle that were on steady. I thought at the time that it could be a stealth bomber, so did not note the date. Later I got a good look at stealth fighters on TV and they have smaller strobing lights. I also found that the description fits other reports of triangles. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone  with this witness, and he seemed serious-minded and credible to us.  He has had several other sightings.  PD));38.5684597402596;-89.8966575757576
