it was old and just repaired;2007-05-15 13:00:00;1min;it was old and just repaired Clear skies,1 in afternoon.  A steel ball 200 ft up and half a block away going maybe 40 to 50 mph.  No intakes or exhaust.  No sounds.  It was old on the lower west side towards me,the rest was just repaired. the old part was rusted like a old barge.  the other two thirds was rust free, new.  YOU could not see any seams,but the rust on the lower left.  It passed in front of a plane,in which i can see the wings, glass and tail maybe 40 miles behind it.  So it wasn`t a plane.  it was steel by the rust,like a barge. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));38.5684597402596;-89.8966575757576
Driving W on 64 just before Caseyville exit and 255 North ramp.  At first I saw a bright object in the top. ((anonymous report));2017-10-04 18:40:00;20 seconds;I was driving westbound on 64 just before you get to the Caseyville exit and 255 North ramp.  At first I saw a bright object in the top left of my windshield, and really had not paid much attention to it.  After about ten seconds or so it was still there and the wheels starting turning in my head.  Itâ€™s gloomy out, nearly sunset and something very bright, orangish silver white very large ball in the sky towards STL, but probably past the city.  In my windshield it was about the size of a dime, maybe smaller.  Pretty intense unique glowing orb or sphere, could not see any solidity to it, whatever it was it was big, and powerful, and seemed to be stationary.  I checked my blind spot, changed lanes and it was gone.  Nothing in the sky at all, this was too high to be any sort of land based object, too late in night and gloomy to be a reflection.  I wish I never took my eyes off it because now I will never be able to piece together what I saw or where it went. I cannot believe it was not on the news, or posted online somehow.  This sighting seems similar to some other sightings, but this was not any sort of misidentified jet or craft, no blinking or anything like that, just an intense ball of light..............I am baffled, maybe someone else will come forward, I feel alone on this one.
