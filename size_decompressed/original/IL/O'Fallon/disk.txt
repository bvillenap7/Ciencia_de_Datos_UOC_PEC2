Off hwy 50 by Belscott and Aikens Grocery Store I lived in ((name deleted)) Trailer Court.  I went to Belscott off hwy 50 to be with my friend to meet her brother, as she was going to O'Fallon High School with me and then her brother picked her up from Belscott. It was broad daylight and we saw a bright shiny object far away and it looked like a very bright light.   ((girl's name deleted)) got into her brother's car and I started walking home.  I don't remember anything until it was pitch dark and I was in front of the mailboxes with a dark large round disc hovering over me.  I ran home and it followed me, it waited until I ran out with my mother and hovered over the trailer next to ours.  Then it tilted itself so we could see the whole thing. It had lights all aound the perimeter and they worked like a movie marquee in that when one light went off the next one went on and so on all around the saucer.  It was big and very bright and colorful and it seemed that the colored lights had a hypnotizing effect.  There was also a red dome on ! top of it. I can only describe the dome like the red lights on the Navy ships when it is dark (I was in the Navy, retired from Air Force).  There was absolutely no sound.  The date is approximate and the time is approximate because I have missing time.;38.5684597402596;-89.8966575757576
Disk seen hovering over residential area in O'Fallon, IL;1983-03-01 20:00:00;2 or 3 minutes;Disk seen hovering over residential area in O'Fallon, IL It was around March of 1983.  It was early evening... between 8 and 9 pm.  My best friend, her mother, aunt and I were coming home from the mall (St. Clair Square).  She had gotten my ears pierced for my birthday.  We were driving along Rt. 50, going east.  We saw something hovering over the trees towards the north.  It was a disk... huge... with lights all around it.  We tried to get as close as we could, but it was hovering in a residential area (in O'Fallon, IL) behind some houses.  We stopped and watched it for a few minutes (no more than 2 or 3), then it dashed away, quicker than anything I had ever seen move.  Then was a dot in the sky and then totally disappeared.  No sound came from it, which we thought was very strange.  We talked about it for a while and everyone thought we were crazy, so we left it alone.  It was close to Scott AFB as well... but we all knew that it wasn't AF related.  Unfortunately, the 2 older women are both deceased.  However, I spoke about it to the aunt's husband this past summer, and he confirmed that his wife had told him about this encounter.
