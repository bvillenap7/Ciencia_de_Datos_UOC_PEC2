Green light streaked across sky;2013-05-04 22:00:00;~1 minute;Green light streaked across sky I was outside on the porch when I saw a sudden flash of light and a green light streaked across the sky leaving a trail behind it.   I called to my friend but just as he turned and I simultaneously attempted to take a picture, the object disappeared.   All my friend was able to see was the very last flash that occurred during the objectâ€™s departure. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.
