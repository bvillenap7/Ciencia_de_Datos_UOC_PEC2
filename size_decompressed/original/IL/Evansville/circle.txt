The number of people there were at least over 50.   I was standing with my husband carrying on a conversation with 5 other friends, when I noticed a ball shaped greenish yellow and blue colored  glowing light around 200 ft in the air.  It was noticed to my right which would be east, slowly traveled over our heads to the west, silent with no sound.  It disappeared, never seem to take off just disappeared as fast as it was noticed.   The next day my husband had heard that several reports of noticing the same thing we seen.  I just decided to add our experience of what we seen to your records.   We have no idea what it was, why it appeared, and how it vanished before all of our eyes.  No fireworks were set off then. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness reports the event accurately.  Please see other reports for this incident.  The incident was first reported to NUFORC by an FAA Air Traffic Controller in Paducah, KY, who reported seeing the object descend vertically down in the northern sky over Illinois.
