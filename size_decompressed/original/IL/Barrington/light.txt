Eight Bright Triangular Shaped Orange Lights Traveling Across Sky;2011-07-03 21:30:00;5 Minutes;Eight Bright Triangular Shaped Orange Lights Traveling Across Sky Just before a July 3rd Firework show in Barrington, IL, at approx 9:30pm, there were 8 bright orange triangular lights that were traveling slowly across the sky at the same pace.  We first thought they were a bunch of airplanes or helicopters in the distance but as they grew closer we could only see the bright orange lights.  They glowed for about 8-10 minutes then each slowly faded away.  Later that evening, at approx. 10:30 pm, there were 2 more of the same exact lights that were seen away from where the lights were first seen.  Those two lights, faded at the same time. ((NUFORC Note:  NUFORC also received a number of telephoned reports from Chicago, for the evenig of July 3rd.  A number of party-goers witnessed five yellow lights in the northern sky, and three of the attendees of the party telephoned our Hotline.  We do not know if the source of this report was one of those individuals at that party.  PD));42.1597;-88.1414

I was coming home, and I just randomly see these blinking dots in the sky of different colors.  Is it UFO or drones?  I also have been seeing these for the past two weeks.  What is going on?

1st time me & dog have both been in observance of 3 orange lights, all in one line, spaced closely to one another.;2018-10-08 22:55:00;3 minutes;Monday, October 8th, 2018 22:55 Barrington,Illinois Clear skies. 1st time me & dog have both been in observance of 3 orange lights, all in one line, spaced closely to one another. Moved directly over my neighbors house, 1,000 feet above perhaps.  3 orange lights had no noise, no blinking lights.  Stopped directly over my house and stopped. My dog and I stared directly at the orange 3 lights,  as my dog did also...both looking up for like 2 minutes.  They as I tried to take photos, 3 orange lights immediately flew upwards. So fast out of sight.  No photos. I came inside my house & my wife asked why we were both outside so long... She said both outside over for 45 minutes...I said no, we me and dog, just went outside to let dog go potty...quickly. She looked outside couple of windows but saw or heard nothing. She asked me, so were did those 40 plus minutes go?  Experience has left me sleepless tonight.;42.1597;-88.1414
