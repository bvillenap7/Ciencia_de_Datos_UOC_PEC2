It caught my attention because it was the only object in the sky at all. It was sunset and the horizon was redish orange and the rest of the western horizon was a cool grey blue. The object was far in the distance and was somehow illuminated. The best I could make out was that it had the shape of two spoons held upright with out the handles. It was a silvery white color and seemed to reflect light. The strange thing was that it was the only thing in the sky. No other object, cloud, plane etc. were present for as far as the eye could see. It was too high to be a balloon and there wasn't any comtrail. It hung in its position for a few minutes and I thought I would get a closer look but after losing sight of it a few times due to the treeline as I drove, I realized that it was moving away from me  and obviously moving at a rapid rate because it disappeared from view in about two minutes.;42.1597;-88.1414
