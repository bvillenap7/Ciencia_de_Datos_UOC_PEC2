Quick flash in the sky;2005-11-08 18:00:00;4 seconds;Quick flash in the sky I was driving home from work about 6:30 at night and was stopped at a red light.  I noticed a quick whitish-grey flash in the dark sky (all cloudy that night no stars were out).  The flash last for about 4 seconds and went from North to South and disappeared into the clouds.   I looked around to see if the driver next to me noticed and I saw the two people in the car point to the sky and were talking to eachother...so I knew I was not the only one that saw it.   I know for sure it was not a plane. This object left a light trail that soon disappeared after the flash.  It was too quick to be a plane.;42.1597;-88.1414
