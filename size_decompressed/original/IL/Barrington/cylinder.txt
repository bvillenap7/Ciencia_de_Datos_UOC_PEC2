Husband & I watched 2 shiny whitish-silver bright tube shaped objects float by in the sky no wings.  ((anonymous source));2019-06-04 20:30:00;10 minutes;8:30ish pm- still light out, my husband & I watched 2 shiny whitish-silver bright tube shaped objects float by in the sky no wings. Around 8:30ish pm- still light out, my husband and I watched a shiny whitish-silver bright tube (cylinder) shaped object float slowly in the sky going west and a little south. It seemed to be very high and had no visible wings or tail and was silent.  It rolled a little at one point 45 degrees and showed a bright light and rolled back.  As it disappeared, a jet came by going south east towards Oâ€™Hare and was loud.  Immediately after the jet passed, another tube shaped item appeared and rolled at exactly the same spot.  At first we thought the object was a blimp or some type of helicopter but it made no noise.  Was pretty strange and stranger to see that others have seen a simalar object.  Weather balloon or military?  Who knows. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));42.1597;-88.1414
