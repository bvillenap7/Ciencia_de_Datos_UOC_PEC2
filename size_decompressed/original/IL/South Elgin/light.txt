Object taking flight near Ohare Airport!!!;2010-08-01 00:30:00;5-10 mins;Object taking flight near Ohare Airport!!! On the date of 8/01/10, my son and i were playing in the lawn.  All of a sudden we both saw a black apache helicopter fly no more than 100 ft off the ground and directly over head of us.   Later that night I was sitting out on my porch in South Elgin, Il. It was around 12:30 am when i looked up in the sky and saw an object ive never seen before.  It slowly hovered up and over the tree line directly east from me.  I watched this orange and yellow light slowly rise.  The top portion of the object was bright orange shaped like an upside down bowl.  It had a bright yellow band in the center, with the the orange shape repeating it self on the bottom.  I watched it hover in spot for several minutes, then slowly move into the tree line.  After it moved into the tree line it then shot directly into the sky outta sight.  At that time it left i heard several helicopters in the area.  From where i was sitting it was roughly 3-5 miles away.  From my point of view I was sitting at a! n angle of 60 degrees from my postion.  I was born and rasied in the chicagoland area, for 25 years of my life i lived at an end of a runway in Elk Grove Village.  I have never seen an object of this shape, design, and flight in all my years of living here.  My father is also retired Navy from the Veitam War, so i have seen and been around aircraft my whole life.   This object just belew me away.;41.9966;-88.2963
