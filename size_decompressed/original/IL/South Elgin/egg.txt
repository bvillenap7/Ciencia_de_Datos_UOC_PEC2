Large bright blue light shoots across low in the sky;2007-05-13 02:50:00;1;Large bright blue light shoots across low in the sky Sunday morning at 2:50 am my wife and I were on our way home driving through South Elgin, IL when we saw a bright blue egg shape object shoot across the sky heading east to west. The object was a blue spherical haze. We initially thought it was a meteor or something. But as I thought about it I remembered it left no trail and I have never seen a meteor that close to the ground, that large, that color or that bright. The object did appear to break up and disappear into splinters. So maybe it was a meteor. I donâ€™t know just thought I should put it out there and see if any one else saw it.;41.9966;-88.2963
