3 black craft,changed shape & became metallic silver as they gained altitude then sat in triangle formation;2006-08-18 03:00:00;15-20minutes;3 black craft,changed shape & became metallic silver as they gained altitude then sat in triangle formation We were on a boat on the Fox River, August 18, 2006, bright,sunny summer day, nearly cloudless,approx. 82 degrees.Slowly,1 after another 3 pitch black objects came out from behind forest preserve trees to the north.Black balls attached by a bar.As they flew right over us and gained altitude they changed to a shiny,metallic silver and round in shape.When all 3 had passed over and then reached the same altitude they came together in a perfect triangular formation where they sat almost directly over out boat for almost 10 minutes.Zero sound.They just sat there over our boat and when we turned to pull up our anchor(maybe 5 seconds),they all disappeared.I have photos of them in their black stage,silver ball stage and in triangle formation.One of my photos has been examined/enhanced by ufologists in Canada and  Germany.Once enlarged/enhanced the silver ballis actually a shiny,metallic spinning top.I would be happy to send my photos t o anyone who may be able to give me any insight.I haven't seen any other ufo photos with an object like the one we saw.I WILL SEND MY PHOTOS UPON REQUEST !!;41.9966;-88.2963
