flashing, tall, white strobe lights over an Illinois cornfield;1989-06-01 22:00:00;45 sec;flashing, tall, white strobe lights over an Illinois cornfield We were driving home going South on Randall Road from the Spring Hill Mall at around 10:00 p.m. All of a sudden we saw a series of tall bright white, flashing lights over the cornfield. The lights themselves were tall bars that flashed quickly parallel to the ground down a line like a strobe light. They looked close, like 40 feet from the ground. We saw a huge dark shape in front of the lights. The object flahed the lights and looked like it was moving south down Randall road, but then disappeared quickly.
