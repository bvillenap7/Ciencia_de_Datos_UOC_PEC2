two orange craft approx. 1/2 mile apart moving west;2010-08-01 01:30:00;1 to 2 minutes;two orange craft approx. 1/2 mile apart moving west Late at night on July 31st/August 1st my friends and I witnessed two large orange lights with a greenish glow behind them.  They were traveling west about a 1/2 mile apart very high in the sky and lasted 30 seconds to 1 minute. They seemed to disappear in an upward direction after their westward flight. Being truly amazed and never seing anything like this before, I went home and searched online for ufo's in South Elgin Illinois and realized that other people have been seing the same thing that my friends and I saw that night, not to mention a story about secret base in the area of the new bridge construction site.  Too strange...;41.9966;-88.2963
