circle cluster of bright lights change to star like cluster and disappears!;2008-06-17 13:00:00;15-20 sec;circle cluster of bright lights change to star like cluster and disappears! In the north sky on my drive to work after lunch I saw a circle cluster of 10 bright lights that were smaller than the larger, brighter object below the cluster. I noticed the cluster above, almost formed a star and then disappeared. I noticed the larger craft below was still there and kept looking for the smaller ones and looked back and the larger one was gone also. I watched the sky and surroundings all the way back to work to try and explain what I saw, but only blue sky and a few clouds.  I got back to work and no one believed me and thought I was crazy! I came home and my daughter believed me and found this site and all the others that have seen things in this area. I had to post my experience to share with others.;42.2937;-89.6354000000001
