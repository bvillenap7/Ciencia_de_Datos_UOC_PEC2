Bright green object moving east inthe same direction Iwas moving.;2007-07-03 03:00:00;5 Seconds;Bright green object moving east inthe same direction Iwas moving. Well it was about 3 a.m. and I was traveling east on highwat 20 on the east side of Freeport,Il. I am a truck driver,finished milk hauler anyway, I noticed this green circular object heading east like I was, towards chicago,Il.  I found this odd because it had to come from my rear to the front. I know this object was not a plane or a falling / shooting star.I've seen all of those numerous times.  I am looking forward and driving east and it came from the west and I saw it out my right side of windshield go west to east. It was a green circular glow going across the sky and I have never seen anything like it before.;42.2937;-89.6354000000001
