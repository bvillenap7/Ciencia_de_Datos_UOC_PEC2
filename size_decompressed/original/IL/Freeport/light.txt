Orange lights in stephenson co. Illinois;2002-01-09 19:00:00;20 minutes;Orange lights in stephenson co. Illinois I was driving north on a country road and looked over to my right, just above the horizon were 3 orangish/white lights,  they weren't blinking and seemed to be still,  I turned right on the next road keeping my eye on them the best that I could, after I turned the one blinked out and the 2 remained,  they were so close and bright it seemed I could easily catch up to them and see what they were for sure.  No matter how fast I went I couldn't get close.  I noticed the one up ahead of me looking as if it was going to cross over the road ahead of me, so I thought I'd be able to see it just over the next hill because it was a clear view of the sky for miles around, well I get over the hill and it is totally gone, no where to be seen, the next time I caught sight of one of them it looked as if it was all the way over Rockford Il. so I gave up my chase and came home.;42.2937;-89.6354000000001
