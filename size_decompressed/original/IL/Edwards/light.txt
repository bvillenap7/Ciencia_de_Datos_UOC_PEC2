A small red light ascended then disappeared.;2012-12-28 20:00:00;6 seconds;A small red light ascended then disappeared I was driving in a rural area at approximately 8:00PM on December 28th, 2012.  I was coming down a large hill and approaching an intersection next to a small town called Edwards in Illinois.  I was driving North and on the left side of the road there is this small area that I believe is dedicated to preserving native prairie grass.  Out of that area, I saw a light ascend at about a 70 degree angle for approximately 6 seconds.  The light was reddish and small and shaped like a cigar.   After 6 seconds the light disappeared.  I was near an airport when this happened but the object was moving much faster than any aircraft I have ever seen and also like I said, it seemed to lauch off of the ground and was very small.  The closest comparison I can think of is to a firework, a roman candle specifically.   However this object did not behave like a firework, it was a steady light source and it maintained a straight trajectory.  Another comparison would be a laser ligh! t or possibly a falling star. I am not trying to say that this was an alien spacecraft or anything like that but I am genuinely curious what this could have been.   I can't think of any reasonable explanation.  I have heard of rods but I would like to think there is a more reasonable explanation.;40.7749;-89.7233
