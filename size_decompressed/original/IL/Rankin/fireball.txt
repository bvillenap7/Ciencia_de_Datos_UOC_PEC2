Large and small fireball object;2019-06-24 23:00:00;150 seconds;Large and small fireball object Was driving on route 9 son who is 11 said look at that bright star and pointed out the window towards the north.  I looked to where he pointed and there was a large bright redish orange light with a smaller same shape colored object just a bit southwest of it in the sky.  I began to pull over because at first i thought maybe it was a planet such as mars. As i looked back at the object it moved in a northeast motion and was gone.  Not even 30 seconds later the smaller object shot off in the same direction.  We sat for a few minutes in disbelief.;40.4585;-87.8868
