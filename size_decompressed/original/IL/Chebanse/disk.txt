To my right up in the clouds I thought I saw a light. All of a sudden the sky lit up with lightning. At the point where I saw the light, Aball of light the size of the moon flashed on for 2-3 seconds then went out. I was thinking that a plane might have gotten struck by lightning. I know that lightning can do some strange things, and I did`nt think anything of it, til I got home, where my wife was freaking out about a disc shaped object she had seen in the soutern sky not more than ten minutes earlier. It was in the direction I was coming from, and it had been ten minutes earlier that I saw what I saw. I only saw a light and then the flash, She said that what she saw had a line of lights around the bottom. It moved back and forth over the tree line then blinked out. I`ve never seen a ufo to my knowledge. This is the first time for my wife too. I`d love to think that what we saw was alien.
