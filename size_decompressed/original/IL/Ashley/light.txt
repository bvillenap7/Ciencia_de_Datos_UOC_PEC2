Strange stationary lights in sky.;2013-09-12 20:45:00;3-4 minutes;Strange stationary lights in sky. 20:45 approx,  My wife and I observed two distinct pulsing lights in different locations in the sky.  Looking up in northern sky I observed a light that blinked on and then off.   Immediately another light went on and off to the left of the first.  Distance between the two was considerable and the weather was clear, no clouds and stars all over the sky.  I observed the first light pulse again and went inside to get my wife.   We came out within 10-15 seconds and we both saw the light pulse in the first spot.  We continued to watch and there was no more activity.   I had the same experience about a week ago and in the same location of the sky.  When I pointed it to my wife there was no more activity. The location is always in the same place, which is in between the North star and Big Dipper, and closer to the North star.;38.3079;-89.2325
