PD));2004-11-05 02:00:00;2-3 hours;2 balls of light one large one small changing colors and there for hours . Two very bright balls one way smaller than the other . They were there for hours and seemed to rise with time in the sky no faster than the moon . They have not been there after that night and we never saw them before this . I have vidoe when zoomed in the small one dissapears and the larger one looks like a glowing ball changeing colors the whole time . You can not even see any of the stars around them they were so much brighter . They were east of Ashley and looked like ther were over Mt Vernon area . I thought they were hellicopters but they were not moveing for hours .On ufoevedince.org theres 5 others that reported the same thing from India to Ca to Mo to Il . Im not normally into this stuff but would like to see if anyone knows what these were . Im an X Marine Married kids good job not some crackpot just want to find out what they were if anyone knows . We watched them off and on from about 2:30 to 4:40 then went to sleep and havnt seen then since that night . We have heard nothing on the news or anyone around here talking about it but I still have it on high 8 video for a couple minutes . ((NUFORC Note:  Venus and Jupiter.  PD));38.3079;-89.2325
