Strange bright objects in sky over Matteson, Il.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a twinkling star.  PD));2015-05-02 23:00:00;4 hours;Strange bright objects in sky over Matteson, Il. I saw an object, way to big to be a star!  It stays still but will change position.  I haven't seen it in the move. It goes up and down, last night it was over to the South. Over the last week I have seen 3 at one time. Also ,what looks like a plane with flashing red lights will fly up to them!  What could this be? ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a twinkling star.
