Light over Route 30 and I-80 in Matteson;1999-08-15 22:00:00;7-10 minutes;Light over Route 30 and I-80 in Matteson Driving along Route 30 eastbound and saw a extremely bright, low-lying light about a mile away from Ridgeland Ave. We drove towards the light and it was not moving at all, just hanging in the sky.  We kept our eyes on it the whole time and it never moved from its position.  As we got right underneath the light, it shot off really fast toward the west.  It went from just hovering to rapidly accelorating to very high speeds.  We couldn't keep up with it so we lost sight of the object.  When we got back on Route 30, there was no light like we had seen just a few minutes before.  There were some airplanes and some stars but no bright,low-lying lights.;41.5102;-87.7406000000001
Very bright red light!;2007-03-19 09:22:00;18 minutes, give or take;Very bright red light! Very bright, fixed red light (similar to Mars on a good observing night - but bigger and brighter!) due north of my home.  Similar to lights reported by me and others from this vicinity in the past.  Observed first from the train station platform, then from my car as I returned home, then with a set of binoculars from my deck . . . went in for a telescope . . . but it was gone when I got back outside.  Observed for approximately 20-22 minutes.;41.5102;-87.7406000000001
My friend and II saw altogether 9 glowing bright orange orbs in the sky.;2016-07-03 22:30:00;20 minutes;My friend and II saw altogether 9 glowing bright orange orbs in the sky. I just saw 9 ufo's about half hour ago. I was taking my dogs for a walk. When we were out in front of the house,  I looked up and saw two round orange lights up in the sky. They were moving from east to west silently.  Suddenly there were four orange glowing lights above me. I called brian and two dissappeared.  Finally the other two dissappeared. Five minutes later two more appeared east and moved towards the west.  It was over the house and a third orange round light appeared.  Two more appeared then no more. They very bright, orange, much bigger than stars.  The sky was cloudy tonight. And completely silent. I don't drink, or do drugs.  WHAT DID WE SEE?  I have a video.;41.5102;-87.7406000000001
