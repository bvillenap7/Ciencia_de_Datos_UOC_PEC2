Driving south toward Arcola I saw a football shaped thing (slender ends on top) with one huge round light in the wide section) flying within the traffic on the interstate. During this time I fought off a very numbing feeling (I almsot felt drowsy) that I believe was caused by the flying object. It was not bigger than a car and it traveled with the cars.  As if bored with what it was doing it rose and went up 2 or 3 cars which traveled in front of me. Finally, it rose and sped at an incredible speed over the small town.  I'm sure that no one besides me can remember it. I fought to stay on top of the incredible spectacle I witnessed.  I went home to tell my family and they all said that it must be something the government was testing.;39.6862;-88.2945
