Three, what we thought were satellites, converged in to a triangle and flew off in a different direction.;1998-07-15 21:30:00;3 minutes;Three, what we thought were satellites, converged in to a triangle and flew off in a different direction. Several years ago, while watching for satellites, at approximately 9:30 p.m., in Scales Mound, Illinois, I saw something similar to a sighting, which is reported here on your site. The place I was watching from is out in the country, totally dark, and one of the highest spots in Illinois, Wisconsin & Iowa. It is quite easy to tell the difference between satellites and aircraft from this vantage point. It is very dark, very little noise (birds and crickets), and quite secluded.  As I watched three satellites move through the sky, I was astounded to see them converge from distant points, and form a triangle, after which they flew off into a different direction.  I know satellites are on a specific trajectory, and seeing them leave that trajectory was very surprising.  I’m just a nurse, not an astronomer, and didn’t know about this website, so told a few friends about it, but didn‘t know where to go from there. Several weeks later, the person whose deck I was watching from (and who laughed at me when I told him about this) was out watching for satellites with me, and we saw the same thing happen, but in a slightly different location in the sky. These sightings looked just like the drawing from Rolla, MO 20:50 hours on April 16, 2007. I’m going to say it was in approximately July and August of 1998 or 1999.
