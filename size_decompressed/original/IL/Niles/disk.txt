Disk object hovering over my head!;2014-07-28 04:30:00;1 minute;Disk object hovering over my head! 	I was working at the time of the occurrence, around 4:30am.   I was delivering papers when I saw this disk object come my way.  My sister and I parked over and got out of the car to take a look.  It was about 150 feet above our heads.  It was a dark disk, that emitted white, orange and red lights.   It traveled very slow, almost as if it was hovering to gaze below.  As soon as it crossed a tree and we had no visual anymore, so we moved to try to look at it again find.  Literally 5 seconds later, it was gone.  Almost as if it vanished. 	Shortly after, we saw a black helicopter travel the same way.  It didn't make any sound as it past us. It only emitted white beams of light. 	At the time we noticed car alarms were flashing.  Almost as if this disk set it off. 	We never saw them again that night.;42.0307;-87.8107
