On the morning of March 2, 2020 I was sitting in my living room listening to music. It was 4:45 am. I noticed a light moving northeast from my area. My first thought was that it was a plane. I saw 10 more in succession and got up to move to the window. These lights continued to cross my sight line going northeast. After seeing about 30 of them, I stepped out on my front porch to get an idea of where they were coming from. It seemed that they were dropping down from the same point in the sky. About one half mile east and south of my house. They would first appear as a dull orb, drop down and become much brighter and then move northeast in a straight line behind the others. I continued to watch until the last one, which was at a longer interval than the others dropped down and took off following the others. I would estimate between 50 and sixty of these lighted orbs continued northeast in a straight line. As the moved farther away they took on the appearance of a long line of! light due to the regular distance between each vehicle. The sky was clear at this time.;41.2954;-90.2901
