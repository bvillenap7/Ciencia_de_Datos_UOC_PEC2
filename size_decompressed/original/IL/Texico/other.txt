a boomerang shaped flying object with numerous lights was seen hovering;1998-04-14 21:30:00;5minutes;a boomerang shaped flying object with numerous lights was seen hovering returning home from town,approximately 9:30 p.m. on april 14 1998,my wife and two children(ages 17 and 13) noticed a bright lightin the sky. they saw the light when they were about 3/4 of a mile from our home. they watched it and it appeared to get brighter as they got closer to home.when they approached the house they said it was hovering stationary over our house. they pulled into our driveway and stopped.  Then the object started to move south and passed directly over them slowly.My son ran in and told me ther was a ufo outside. I ran out side and saw it then .by then it was about 400-500 feet south of the house. we watched it continue south maybe 1/4 mile and it turned west. Note as strange as this might sound,this is the third encounter like this I have had. once about 1968, once in 1974, and this current one. Could you tell me if other people have had numerous close sightings? and if there were any other reportings on april 14 1998? It traveled maybe a mile or so and then we lost sight of it.I took my family inside and one at a time had each one draw a picture and give me a discription of the object. they were seperated when they gave me this imformation yet all discriptions were alike. the object was 75-100 feet above the ground approximately 30 feet wide, boomerang shaped,numerous lights on the bottom (blue,red,pinkish yellow), two brights lights on the front which you could'nt see from the bottom. It was dark in color,no shine. it was silent. When they first saw it it was hovering,then when they stopped and got out it was moving at a walking pace,and faster as it left.;38.4238;-88.8701
