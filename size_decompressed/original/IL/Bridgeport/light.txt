3 Lights;2009-11-09 20:40:00;Between 2-3 minutes;3 Lights I noticed a row consisting of three orange balls of light in the sky approx. 2 miles from my home. The balls of light were spaced roughly 500 yards apart from one-another. After a little while the middle light began to fade. When this light had almost entirely 'switched-off' it quickly gained altitude, regained its vivid light and hovered in the same place for a little while. Soon the surrounding two lights followed the central light upto the same altitude. For about 10 seconds the lights hovered there in a row before shooting south at an unmeasurable rate of speed. It was hard to focus on the light as it was too bright and blurry for most of the time. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
