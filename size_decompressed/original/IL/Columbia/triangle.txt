Moving fast and straight from E-SE to W-NW at high alt At approximately 2320 hrs., I was on the back deck of my house observing a beautifully clear sky.  I noticed a commercial aircraft making its decent and approach to St. Louis Lambert Field.  The airport is approximately 30 miles NW of my home.  It appeared the aircraft was heading to runway 30L at Lambert.   The commercial aircraft had its nose light on, when I noticed a light that at first appeared to be a spot light in the sky.  It was moving fairly rapidly and straight.  I thought it looked like a flight of geese, in a similar formation.  Then I realized it was not changing shape like geese do.  The object appeared to be a triangle shape of lights that were not very bright.  One side seemed longer than the other and had a straight line of lights on the tail end.  It was silent and blocked out the light from stars it passed in front of.  It moved at a rapid pace faster than the commercial aircraft that would have been to it's left.  Had the pilots seen the object, it would have been viewed by the co-pilot at about a 1 o'clock high position.  The unknown object then passed above the commercial aircraft and continued on a 290 course.   I spent 20 years in the United States Air Force with over 5000 flight hours and know this was no aircraft I have ever seen. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and found him to be quite sober-minded.  Given his manner over the telephone, combined with his experience around aircraft while he was in the U. S. Air Force, we suspect that he probably is an excellent, and qualified, witness.
