On 01/13/09 4:25pm I was driving south on Eldamain rd. NE of Plano Il. I observed a stationary bright chrome looking light, small at first then bigger and brighter. Altitude seemed to be over a 1000â€™. As I continued to observe it looked to start moving east and then lost brightness and disappeared. I continued to look and see if I could see a plane or jet, there was nothing. This transpired within 20 to 30 seconds.
