5 Fireball objects in sky over far western Chicago suburbs.;2013-04-27 20:53:00;3 minutes;5 Fireball objects in sky over far western Chicago suburbs. I was driving south on Rock Creek Road in Plano, Illinois, just outside of town and witnessed 4 fireball looking objects coming from the western sky, the fireball looking objects were in pairs of 2 in the front and 2 following behind.  The 2 in the back were almost crossing paths at one point.  I proceeded to pull over and get out of my vehicle just outside of town near a corn field to get a better look.  I got out of my vehicle and watched 4 of them rise into the sky and changed from a orange color to a silver light as what looked like as they went higher in altitude and disappeared into the sky which was from my vantage point was almost straight up from where i was standing.  Then 1 more appeared from the same western direction the rest of them came from.  It disappeared in the sky almost at the same location in the sky as the previous 4 had done.  These fireball looking objects were bright orange and they DID NOT have oscillating lights like a airplane would have and did not produce any noise.  I was the only witness, I called family across town at 20:53CDT and my phone cut out in the middle of the call so i called again at 20:56CDT to see if they could see these objects but by time they answered the phone these objects had already disappeared in to the sky.  Unfortunately i did not get any pictures or videos of this event.;41.6729;-88.5413
Orange flare that rose in the southwest sky and continued on overhead to the northeast until no longer visible.;2014-09-28 21:15:00;10 seconds;Orange flare that rose in the southwest sky and continued on overhead to the northeast until no longer visible. The object rose in the southwest sky and continued on overhead to the northeast until no longer visible behind the treeline. It wiggled side-to-side a little in its flight path but flew mostly straight. It was bright orange and crossed the sky quickly, in a matter of seconds. It looked like a firework at first, but didn't burst--it just kept going. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is flawed.  We have changed it, to reflect a sighting in September 2014, not October 2014.  PD));41.6729;-88.5413
