It was a rectangular shape, it was flying a bit above aircraft height and was white and blinked an occasional blue and red. It was fairly small and extremely fast. The UFO appeared to be shooting out things that looked light lightning out from behind it but instead of it going down it made a trail behind them for about three 5 seconds before disappearing. The lightning thing appeared white with a blue outline and was extremely thin. There was only one UFO. We were laying on a trampoline stargazing when my sister pointed it out to me, it was dark and cloudy so the UFO really stuck out. We watched it until we thought it was getting to close and left. We couldn’t figure out what it was, we’ve never seen anything like it.;40.1444;-89.3648
