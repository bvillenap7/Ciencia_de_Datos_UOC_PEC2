light in northeast sky;1975-06-22 09:00:00;15 min;light in northeast sky IM almost colored blind, but it was yellow to orange.Oval in shape.It was in the northeast sky.I tried to convince myself it had to be something that could be explained by somebody, so I went on down the railroad tracks just a few miles north of town where I sometimes went to hike.It didnt seem to be moving though.It was almost liquid rather than metallic so that was another reason I dismissed it I guess. There didnt seem to be any real solid lines of shape.It could of been behind a cloud. It never seemed to move but it was in north east sky.A ballon would have moved sometime or another.I have heard lately of other people seeing a liquid object and that is why I am finally saying something. This may be a coincidence, but most of my life I have felt that something (terrible) happened to me at young age, and I cant remember what it was. I know they are real now.TRUTH ((NUFORC Note:  Date of alleged sighting is approximate.  We observe that the description of the object allegedly sighted is consistent with a sighting of the Sun.  PD));40.1444;-89.3648
