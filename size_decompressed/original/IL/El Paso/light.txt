Large Orange Sphere's Over Rural Illinois;2004-10-15 21:45:00;10 Seconds;Large Orange Sphere's Over Rural Illinois One evening in October 2004, I don't remember the exact date, I was outside burning our paper trash and noticed three fairly large orange lights in the north west sky.  They were each about the size of a dime held at arms length and appeared to be over the nearby village of Secor, IL.  They were in an uneven triangular formation with a vertical orientation.   The lights appeared to ascend in a slow manner and simply disappeared.  The  three lights were large but dull orange spheres. They were not entensly bright and were about 15 degrees above the horizion and rising to about 25 degrees before disappearing.   The entire sighting lasted at least 10 seconds.  I even started to run inside to get my binoculars but by the time I reached the house they were gone.;40.7327;-89.0164
Single Low Flying Star Like Object in Central Illinois.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of International Space Station.  PD));2005-11-01 18:00:00;30 seconds;Single Low Flying Star Like Object in Central Illinois While driving home from work I noticed a slow moving star like object at an apparent low altitude.  The object appeared to be flying fairly low at +/-1000 feet.  The object was traveling slow in a north easterly direction.   After about 30 seconds the light began to change colors and as it turned red it simply faded until it blinked out.  The weather was clear and the normal stars were visable.  There was one commuter jet that was in the air at the same time as this star like object and it appeared to pass over the UFO.   This is the second time I've seen this type of object.  My first sighting occurred in late August or early September of 2005 and was witnessed by my wife.   The object appeared very bright but also small.  I would estimate it's brightness similar to Venus, but not as large, and it moved against the background of stars.

The link you forwarded actually indicates the portions of the orbit where the ISS remains reflective.  The ISS really did seem low, which must have been an optical illusion.

Bright Flashing Light In Western Sky w/ Multi-Colored Lights;2006-08-17 00:15:00;15-20 Minutes;Bright Flashing Light In Western Sky w/ Multi-Colored Lights At approximately midnight on the night of 8/16/06, the morning of 8/17/06, I was preparing to go to bed for the night and was making my rounds making sure that the doors were secured.  While locking our westward facing sliding door I noticed a stationary and flashing light that seemed to be bigger and brighter than the surrounding stars.  The size and brightness appeared to be at least twice the size of stars near the position of the light. It appeared similar to a street light from two miles away.  The somewhat large size and the quickly changing colors are what cought my eye.  The light appeared motionless long enough to be video taped for several minutes.  The sky was partly cloudy with a half moon near the eastern horizon.  With the video camera zoomed in on the light it appeared diffused with a very bright center region with multiple flashes of red, green, purple, and white lights around the edge.  When I first saw the light I assumed that it was Venus but it appeared brighter and bigger with multiple flashing colors.  I will attempt to download the digital video in the near future.  The light was positioned west by north west from my position at approximately 25 degrees from the western horizon.  At approximately 12:20am on 8/17/06 I stopped recording and went in the house to go to bed with the light still in the same position.  I have assumed that the light was Venus but crop circles have been reported 60 miles west by north west of my position and thought that I should at least report my experience.  Total vewing time would be about 20 minutes.  At one point a commercial flight passed within the vicintiy of the light without making any noticable flight path changes.  Venus?  Or Intergalatic Crop Dusters????;40.7327;-89.0164
