Large Meteor Re-Enters of El Paso;2005-04-09 02:10:00;5 Seconds;Large Meteor Re-Enters of El Paso While driving home, 4/10/05, after a night out with some friends I witnessed what I took to be a meteor entering the earths atmosphere.  The event was dramatic but brief.  I estimate it lasted approximately 3-5 seconds.   While driving I noticed a large neon green light, witha short teardrop tail, traveling at an obviously high rate of speed.  It was descending on a near vertical path.  There was a thin layer of clouds that the meteor appeared to penetrate.  As it penetrated the clouds there was a large flash of light, which eluminated the clouds.   The meteor then exploded into numerous and smaller shooting stars.  As the meteoriods continued to descend they all winked out prior to striking the ground. Although I feel this sighting is of a natural origin I have had one other sighting that I am not so sure of.  Last fall while outside I witness three pale orange balls of light in the north western sky that appeared to be  slightly ascending slowly disappeared. The lights appeared to be the size of a dime held a arms length. The lights were not blinding bright and were not fireworks.;40.7327;-89.0164
