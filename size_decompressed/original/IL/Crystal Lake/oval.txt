Didn't know this Object was in the clouds till I got home and looked at the picture.;2011-06-22 07:30:00;Picture;Didn't know this Object was in the clouds till I got home and looked at the picture. I had taken my morning bike ride to Crystal Lake Beach on a cloudy day before School.  I got to the Baseball field across the street and took a breather before turning back home.   The Sun peaking thru the clouds looked inspirational so I took a picture of it.  I was going to post a picture on a Blog with inspirational wording.  I am a Personal Trainer and try to get people out and moving.   I returned home without looking at the picture.  When I cam home I brought the picture up to show the wife how pretty the Sun looked.  It was then I had seen this Red oval.   I showed the wife and said it had to be the moon or something reflecting from the Sun.  She said the moon doesn’t sit behind the Sun at Sun-Rise.   I thought true so posted it on F.B to get Corkey comments.   When I go to school this girl that sits next to me zoomed in on it and had this look on her ace like OMG show others.  The others of course said wow but made funny comments.  I mean we are talking the unkown here.   So I just thought you guys would like to see it and tell me what you think.   I  will warn you I am a prankster however this is not one of them.  I had just downloaded an app on my phone with ghost to impose on pictures.   But AGAIN I swear this isn’t a prank!!;42.2358305555556;-88.3351222222224
