Pointy  shaped craft on moon, disappeared after seen through high powered telescope.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Jupiter??

So, I was looking at the moon through a telescope and I noticed on the left side of the moon that there was a peak tall enough to be noticed, and in a place where there shouldnt be any peaks.   So i called a buddy over and told him that i saw something strange on the moon.  He took a pair of binoculars and looked at the moon, and, sure enough, it was there too.   So we looked up a map of the moon, and came back 15 minutes or so, and it was gone.   Also, earlier in the evening, we had moved the telescope to avoid a tree that was in the way.   And after we had looked up the map the tree was mysteriously in the way again, and the pyramid ish like thing was gone.   We were the only ones home and there was nobody to move the telescope.
