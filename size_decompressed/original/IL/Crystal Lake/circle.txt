This was 2 singular bright lights shining downward/outward close together but apart traveling at a high speed (faster than our regular airforce jets)  and they did not have any wing or tail red lights flashing  or the usual military lighting that has been the norm over northern ILLINOIS.  These were 2 very bright white lights traveling from Southeast to Northwest with each light brighter than the stars or regular aircraft.... I know this clearly.  Nothing like these came overhead before.  Larger bright lights. 20-30 secs. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
