light beams and light rays at 4:45 am;2009-03-02 04:45:00;10 mins;light beams and light rays at 4:45 am i was heading north on rt 31 into crystal lake at about 4:45am. i looked to my left and saw beams of white light coming from the sky to the ground. the best way to describe what i saw would be like bright white search lights they use for a grand opening only if they were in the sky pointing straight down and not moving. there were about 10 light beams i saw they looked to be over an area that had just houses. there was one light that flashed a few times as i was watching it looked like lightning only the way it flashed and the color but it stayed a beam. also i saw what looked like when the sky is cloudy and the sun breaks thru and you see the rays of sun come down but it didnt go allthe the way down. it really looked there were light sources in the clouds that caused the rays cause i saw the ray go down and up from the clouds. i am not alone in seeing this event i was on my way to work when i say it. when i got into work 2 guys came up to me and asked if i saw the lights also. i said yes and we all saw the same thing pretty much but we came different ways to work. so as the day went on i talked to a bunch more guys at work and i found almost 20 different people coming from different directions that all saw pretty much the same thing and i know there is more this was very bright and alot of people were on the way to work. its should be with in radar range from a small airport ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Red light.;2015-07-04 21:20:00;25 minutes;I was watching the fireworks display looking north towards the lake.  During the fireworks display there was a red light which was hovering behind the fireworks, and remained still for some minutes.  Then it moved slowly to the west and stood still there.  After some minutes moved east and stood there.  Then it moved higher up and then slowly moved down until it was out of sight because the tree line in the horizon blocked my view.  About 5 minutes later it moved up and it was visible again.  Then it kept moving west and east.  During all these movements it changed its speed, sometimes moving quickly and sometimes moving slowly.  This all lasted for about 30 minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  We have corrected the date above.

Glowing Light With Halo of Light Surrounding;2017-08-01 21:30:00;4 minutes;Glowing Light With Halo of Light Surrounding My brother and I witnessed a large light in the sky, moving from the south, heading north.  The light was about the size of a pencil eraser in the sky.  The object seemed to have a circle or halo of light surrounding it.   After a minute of amazement, I thought to grab my high-powered binoculars.  Looking through the binoculars the point of light became sharper, but remained just that, a point of light.  The surprising observation was the circle of light/halo surrounding the object.  As the point moved, the halo moved with the light.  The halo was set apart from the point of light,   I could clearly see other stars in the space between the light and the inner ring of the halo.  I submitted this report after seeing another individual submitted a report on the same sighting on 8/4/17 out of Rockford, 40 miles west of my location.   As a closing comment we have almost a sighting a month here of strange phenomena in the sky (mostly flashes). ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date above is approximate.

We noticed that two changed direction and vanished.  Shortly after that, the remaining lights separated in the sky to blend in with natural stars.  They were totally silent.;42.2358305555556;-88.3351222222224

Again it was singular bright light.  Not an airplane or jet or small/tiny slow satellite.  It's an abnormal nonairplane bright white light.;42.2358305555556;-88.3351222222224
I witnessed a bright light zoom quickly from the west that stopped perfectly stationary over Crystal Lake IL during the fireworks show;2021-07-04 21:47:00;10 minutes;I witnessed a bright light zoom quickly from the west that stopped perfectly stationary over Crystal Lake IL during the fireworks show on July 4th 2021. It moved away quickly when the airforce jets came near it and then it moved quickly away super fast to the west and was out of sight then.at first I thought it was a helicopter. it disappeared superfast and I saw this. I have a phone video. Then a double red-light UFO was overhead to my right above the trees that moved rapidly and then zoomed quickly away within the next 5 minutes as I recorded this sighting too.2;42.2358305555556;-88.3351222222224
