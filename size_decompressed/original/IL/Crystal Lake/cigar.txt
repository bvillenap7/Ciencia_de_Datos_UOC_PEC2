I saw what looked like a star moving across the sky about as fast as you'd see an airplane moving.   I kept staring at it because I did feel a bit odd about the situation.  Something was telling me that it wasn't an airplane.   As it moved slowly, it looked as though it was coming closer, or becoming larger.  I knew this because at first I could not tell what shape it was, but as it was getting closer/getting larger, I saw that it was a cigar shape.  I couldn't tell if it had a top.  It also had red and white lights.  Here I saw the sequence of lights like this:  1   2   3   4   5  5 was a red light.  It was flash, then 4,3,2,1 would flash one after the other.  Not at the same time, but in order from 5 to 1.  Left to right, then start over from left to right again.  I couldn't tell exactly how many lights it had, this is just a description.  It only had one red light though.  The UFO never got any closer than how high a normal airplane would get.  After about 3-4 mintues--just enough time for me to process what I was looking at, it just flew off and left a tail like a shooting star would.  It looked at though the craft went up and out, not across when it took off.  It tail of light had a sense of depth, not just a flat line across the sky.  It faded into space is how I can describe it.;42.2358305555556;-88.3351222222224
