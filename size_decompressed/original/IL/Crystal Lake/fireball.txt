Nov 16,1999 Meteor, fireball sighting;1999-11-16 21:05:00;45sec to 1 min;Nov 16,1999 Meteor, fireball sighting went to pick up wife at work , drove over from woodstock il. hoping to go home and try to see  the meteor  shower predicted that nite I just was coming into downtown crystal lake, and in the southern sky  I first detected what i thought was fireworks like a an emergency flare very white bright it made my hair stand on end, right away i thought it was the meteor shower with a closer visitor that managed to drop below the broken clouds, it seemed to hang and burn in the atmosphere slowly traveling west to east. it was white circular shaped with red, orange phosphor green, and the tail  was about 1 to 2 mile behind it. After reading the reports from the sighting from sycamore illinois right before this sighting i wonder if it was something other than a meteor. ((NUFORC Note:  Many reports from the Midwest on this night.  We think the witness may have indicated the wrong time, but the date appears to be correct.  NUFORC is still not certain what occurred that night.  PD));42.2358305555556;-88.3351222222224
Large Flaming Football-Shaped Object Over Crystal Lake, Illinois;2008-02-23 01:45:00;30 seconds;Large Flaming Football-Shaped Object Over Crystal Lake, Illinois Saturday, February 23rd, 2008 was a cold, crisp, and clear-sky night in Crystal Lake.. the stars were exceptionally bright this evening and really stood out from the dark sky they resided in.  At approximately 1:45 AM, I was desparately trying to get our dog to come back in the house after having just let her out 5 - 10 minutes or so prior to the event.  The reason for trying to get our dog back in the house so quickly - was that she had started to bark at something and I didn't want her barking to disturb our neighbors. So, I went out into our back yard and found our dog just sitting in the snow in the middle of our yard barking at something up in the air.   At first I thought it might be a squirrel, rabbit, or raccoon - which we have seen in our neighborhood on more than once occassion - so I scanned our one main tree in our backyard for sign of one of these animals but didn't see anything despite our dog still barking.  It was then that a huge football-sh! aped object appeared out of nowhere in the southwest sky.  The object was more rounded on the ends (as opposed to coming to a point like a football), and was completely on fire.. it was a large flaming object that suddenly appeared, remained motionless for 10 seconds or so, and then rocketed off in a southwest direction at a speed that was - I would say - impossible.  It left the entire observable night sky area in under 1 second.  It went from (seemingly) standing still, to being gone in under a second.  The object did not have any lights or sound.;42.2358305555556;-88.3351222222224
I witnessed unidentified lights in the sky.;2011-08-13 21:00:00;10 minutes;I witnessed unidentified lights in the sky. My wife let our dog out in the yard and found our neighbors watching lights in the sky.  She called me to come see this for myself. I saw two bright lights, reddish orange to white, moving across the sky, just beneath the clouds. The lights were very bright and produced eminating rays, in the manner that a point source of light would.  Given their approximate distance, they would have been quite large. The lights moved at a steady rate of speed, from North to South.  There were no sounds or blinking lights. I have seen plenty of aircraft flying with their landing lights on, but this in no way resembled that. I have also seen more than my share of military flares while in Southeast Asia, and these were not flares. They continued south for several minutes and suddenly disappeared.;42.2358305555556;-88.3351222222224
