6 Diamond, faintly lit objects flying amongst each other.;2015-04-11 19:00:00;20 seconds;6 Dimond, faintly lit objects flying amongst each other. Walking around the neighborhood, we stopped for a rest quick and continued our conversation.  Naturally I was looking into the sky, I noticed something.  Which could almost be explained as flying fairly transparent Dimond shaped crafts.  Swinging amongst each other as if part of a symphony.  I say this because there is no other way to portray it.  It most definitely was not a flock of birds.   The light admitted was faint, very dull, and blending in with the horizon.  It lasted all of  20 seconds, and even if i had recorded it.  The cell phone video would not have picked up the low light admittance. Ive been looking ever since to try and catch the same thing.;42.2358305555556;-88.3351222222224
