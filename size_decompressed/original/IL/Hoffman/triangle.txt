I awoke at about 3:30 a.m.,I don't remember why I woke, but I decided to go outside to have a cigarette (I didn't smoke in the house)It was a clear,crisp night.Te deck was facing South,off to my right(East)I saw a bright light in the corner of my eye.When I looked directly at it,It looked like a pair of car headlights in the sky..the color of this pair of lights was very similar to those on a car,but very bright.These appeared at about a 45 degree angle,and were moving towards me (to the West)I could not determine  the heigth.....but it seemed to be very high...nor could I be certain of it's size..but if it was the average heighth of the jets that fly over the area...it was very large,as large or larger than the B1 which I have seen several times.When it was directly over me I could see three blue-white large circular lights,one on each corner. In the exact middle was a small blinking, or pulsing ,red light. The craft slowly continued off to the West..I watched 'till I couldn't see it any more.I didn't notice any sound..However, as I lost sight of it I did hear a very soft engine-like sound,perhaps a plane ,but,I don't believe the craft was the source.The whole thing probably took 10 minutes or so.;38.5442;-89.2632
