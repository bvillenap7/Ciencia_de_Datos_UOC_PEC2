Colorful, pulsing light in western sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible a sighting of Jupiter in the western sky.  PD));2007-08-30 22:00:00;1 hour;We were in our bedrooms earlier tonight when my cousin comes running downstairs all scared and disturbed of what he had seen. During all of his babel my mother and I decided to play along, to our amazement we where left perplexed. I saw a pulsing object in the western sky that at first I thought to be a planet until it moved. I swore that my eyes were playing tricks on me but I saw what I saw.  This object turned red,green,white, then it would emit a pulsing a sapphire color twice every rotation. That was very interesting and unexplainable. After about 1/2 hour or so it split into 2 different individual pieces, it seemed to have fallen towards earth. This piece was different it hovered down then faded from a light bluish color to a white then it faded to black like it was concealing itself or burning out. My mother, cousin, and I still are not aware of what we saw but it wasn't something that would be experienced on a daily basis. A concerned watcher of the sky.
