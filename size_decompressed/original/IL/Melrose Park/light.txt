As I opened my door to let the dog out, I noticed what, at first, I thought was an airplane in the distance coming directly at me from the south.  As it came closer, I realized it wasn't a plane.  It had 7 or 8 lights that were shaped in a star formation.  The object stopped, then traveled from east to west rapidly across the sky until it faded from sight.  I had stepped onto my deck to get a better look and there was no sound from this object.   At 4:00  in the morning I could here trains that roll down the track one mile from my house.  It was definitely not an airplane or helicopter.  I live 20 minutes from Ohare Field and am familiar with landing patterns and what planes look like at night, since I've seen over a hundred thousand planes flying by in my lifetime.                         . .     .    .     {looked like this .     .;41.9040933333333;-87.8674
