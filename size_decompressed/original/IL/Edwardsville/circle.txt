It was 3 circles of small, pulsating lights.;2001-01-06 00:00:00;Do not know;It was 3 circles of small, pulsating lights. We viewed it through a very powerful telescope.  There were 3 rings of light that were pulsating.  They seemed to change colors, from reds to blues.  The craft seemed to be hovering, and moving only now and then - but not abruptly.  It seemed to be floating.  At one point it seemed to split or something came out of it. ((NUFORC Note:  The report seems reminiscent of twinkling stars.  We do not know what the witnesses were observing.  Also, we do not know what 30:28 hrs. means.  PD));38.8119700767263;-89.9626470588234
