IN EDWARDSVILLE, IL 62025 WHEN I GOT TO THE CORNER OF SCHWARTZ  RD. AND BROWN ST. I SAW ONE LARGE LIGHT HOVERING OVER SOME TREES, BUT WHEN I GOT TO THE NEXT CORNER WICH IS SPRINGER ST., I GOT A MUCH CLEARER VIEW, THE LARGE LIGHT I SAW WAS ONE OF THREE. THE LARGE LIGHT WAS THE TOP OF THE TRIANGLE, UNDERNEATH THAT WAS TWO SMALLER LIGHTS.  THE TOP LIGHT WAS VERY BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT, THE OTHER TWO LIGHTS WERE LIGHT GREEN , BUT JUST AS BRIGHT AS THE TOP LIGHT.   THIS DISPLAY OF LIGHTS LASTED ABOUT 45 SECONDS. I HAD  DRIVEN ABOUT  2 BLOCKS EAST ON SCHWARTZ RD.  THE PATTERN OF LIGHTS APPEARED CLOSE AT FIRST BECAUSE IT SEEMED TO HOVER OVER SOME TREES BUT WHEN I GOT TO THE NEXT CORNER I COULD TELL THE LIGHTS WERE AT A GREAT DISTANCE, THE BRIGHTNESS MADE IT LOOK CLOSER THAN WHAT IT WAS.

Very large triangular shaped object with points of bright white light moving very slowly across a field and then following a highway.;2007-05-15 17:30:00;15 min;Very large triangular shaped object with points of bright white light moving very slowly across a field and then following a highway. Incident description: I was on my way home from work in May of 07 on HWY 157 going into Edwardsville IL and had just turned on from the HWY 270 exit. HYW 157 proceeds up curving hill and off my left shoulder I saw a very large stationary triangular shaped object over a large field near the SIUE college campus. I slowed my car down and looked at the object for several seconds and then turned off the road at the top of the hill at a hotel parking lot. I got out of the car and could see the object clearly motionless over a field at an altitude of approximately 200 to 300 feet about 250 yards away from me. The object started to move tward me at an estimated 30 MPH heading toward HYW 157 moving south. The craft climbed to approximately 500 to 700 feet and followed HWY 157 heading in the direction of the next town Collinsville.  I returned to the car and follow the craft for about 5 to 10 minutes as it traveled down HWY 157 untill it stopped following the road and disappeared over a hill.  Craft Description: Large triangular shaped object at an estimated 100x150 feet Black in color Traveled at an estimated 30 to 40 MPH, no sound was herd Craft had many bright white lights at various locations along edges the white lights were not blinking and no other colored lights were observed When I followed the craft from behind no visible propulsion just the white lights along the perimeter edges The craft was approximately 20 to 30 feet thick  Weather: It was dusk on a clear 65-degree evening with no clouds in the sky the sky had a red hue as the sun was near the horizon  Observations: The craft was so large and moving so slowly I realized immediately that wings could not provide enough lift to keep an object of this size aloft at that speed.
