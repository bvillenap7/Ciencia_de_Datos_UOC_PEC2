The rest of the sky had no visible stars and we had been  commenting on  this the last two hours of our trip from Columbus, Ohio.   We suddenly saw an object overhead,  around an 11 o'clock position that was diamond shaped but with a couple of extra short arms extending out from it.  At first we thought it might be a plane, but the movement of the object did not coincide with the movement of a plane.  It hovered in almost the same location, moving up and down slightly, for about 30 minutes,  I have seen many helicopters in the sky but this did not look like one.  We were very tired and did not call anyone, just went to bed when we got home.  It was not like any other object I have observed before.;38.8119700767263;-89.9626470588234
