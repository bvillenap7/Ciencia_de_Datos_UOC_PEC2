Brightly light moving across sky and dimming until gone.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible satellite??  PD));2012-07-04 21:15:00;1 minute;Brightly light moving across sky and dimming until gone. I was waiting fir the 4th of July firework show to begin.  I was looking upward at the stars when I noticed one of the brighter stars moving slowly across the sky.  I watched it for a few seconds then it dimmed and disappeared.   I ask the group of people around me if anyone else saw that and one person confirmed the same site as I witnessed.  I assumed it was a satilite that went into the shadow of the earth.;38.8119700767263;-89.9626470588234
6 bright orange lights in a loose formation.;2013-03-02 21:55:00;5 minutes;6 bright orange lights in a loose formation. At 2155 hrs I saw 6 orange color lights in a loose formation in the South/East sky.  The lights were brighter than the surrounding stars and did not look like any craft I have ever seen. The lights appeared to be moving at slightly different speeds and after a short time 4 of the lights faded and disappeared.   2 of the lights remained and 1 stayed stationary while the other appeared to move from north to south. After about 5 minutes the remaining lights slowly faded and disappeared. The sky was mostly clear at the time of the sighting. There was an aircraft in a different area of the sky and was not similar to the orange lights.;38.8119700767263;-89.9626470588234

Same color of star moving between two  stars in the sky but stopped and dimmed out in its place;2020-06-15 03:00:00;15 seconds;Same color of star moving between two  stars in the sky but stopped and dimmed out in its place We had been stargazing and using an app on our phone to see what was in the sky. up and to the right of Jupiter, there was a light that caught my eye. The sky was completely clear it had the same color as a star but having seen shooting stars I know it didn’t behave like one or move the speed of it, nor was it an airplane I’ve seen hundreds of those but it  just stopped moving along the sky  and dimmed out, it seemed very high and didn’t travel a great distance from what it seemed but so strange it just disappeared. I know there were no clouds and it was between two stars so I know nothing was construed it just stopped moving and dimmed out where it stopped.;38.8119700767263;-89.9626470588234
