Fireballs seen in northern sky north of Edwardsville, IL on July 21, 2011;2011-07-21 21:30:00;3 minutes;Fireballs seen in northern sky north of Edwardsville, IL, on July 21, 2011 I had gone to bed early without eating any dinner when I decided to get up and have some cereal.  I was sitting at my breakfast table which overlooks approximately 5 acres with a tall tree line in the horizon.  Suddenly a bright yellow fireball shoots straight up from the other side of the tree line.  At first, I thought it was fireworks and I waited for the burst but there was no burst and no sound.  The object continued to ascend into the northern sky with some flickering of light until I could see it no more. Just a few minutes later, two large fireballs shot straight up from beyond the tree line.  The one on the left was more red in color and the one on the right was yellow-orange.  They followed essentially the same pattern as the first fireball.  I opened my patio door to get a better look but I coudn'nt make out anything other than these silent round fireballs which continued to ascend until I couldn't see them anymore. I wasn't overly concerned by what I saw not sure at all what I was seeing but it definitely wasn't fireworks.  I just went to bed around 9:45 p.m. after finishing my cereal.  Today, I told my husband about the incident and he just laughed.  I picked up my PC to see if anyone had reported anything similar.  That's when I ran across this UFO reporting site.  Not sure if this site is legit or not buy here's my post. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));38.8119700767263;-89.9626470588234
5 yellow orange fireball/orbs seen by 3 people in Southern Illinois near 20 miles from St.louis;2012-09-01 21:00:00;10 minutes;5 yellow orange fireball/orbs seen by 3 people in Southern Illinois near 20 miles from St.louis My wife, grandson and I were traveling west from Edwardsville Il on Route 143, when my wife noticed 2 objects  moving  west also.  We pulled over to the side of the road to observe. They appeared to be fireball like with red around them.  They were flying/moving  below  fairly  low cloud cover created by remnants of hurricane Issac.  No noise whatsoever was coming from these objects.  One fireball disappeared into the clouds and the other stopped, changed direction, then started moving  east. This fireball then disappeared into the clouds after it passed us.  As this one disappeared, 3 more appeared from behind us moving west, passed us, then disappeared up into the clouds.  They did not to appear to be moving very fast to us. We have never encountered or seen anything like this before. My grandson got very scared and we tried to put it off to him as airplanes.  There was another car going east  that stopped to observe also.  They got out of their car for a coupl! e of minutes but left before we could talk to them.;38.8119700767263;-89.9626470588234
