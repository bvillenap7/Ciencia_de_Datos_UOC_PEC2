Oval object flew over me very fast and made no noise never saw anything like it before.;2008-12-10 20:25:00;2 seconds;Oval object flew over me very fast and made no noise never saw anything like it before. I was standing in Southern Illinois University behind the science building and right above the building I saw a oval shaped object that went by fast.   The whole thing was glowing white and there was no trail behind it.   Also it did not make a noise.  The background was just the nights sky. If you find out what it was email me.;38.8119700767263;-89.9626470588234
