Strange Double Shooting Star Type Objects Over Edwardsville, Illinois;2012-08-11 23:55:00;three minutes;Strange Double Shooting Star Type Objects Over Edwardsville, Illinois This event occurred on Saturday, August 11, 2012, at approximately 11:55 PM (23:55 Central Standard Time).  I was sitting on my deck in Edwardsville, Illinois, facing North.  I saw a white light shoot across the sky from East to West.  I thought it was a shooting star, but then I noticed a white blinking light hovering in the same location where the shooting star started its projection.  I thought this blinking light must be a plane.  But the light remained in the same location for almost a minute.  Also, it blinked rather slowly and uncoordinatedly unlike a planeâ€™s rhythmic blinking.   Then all of a sudden, the blinking ceased and I saw another white streak of light move quickly in the same path, from East to West.  This time the light was followed by a white vapor trail or white smoke.  The white light lasted only about a second but the white trail remained for about twenty seconds.   I sat watching the same area of sky for another three minutes to see if ! anything else would happen, but all activity ceased. I no longer believe it was a shooting star since it happened twice in the same location within three minutes of each other.;38.8119700767263;-89.9626470588234
