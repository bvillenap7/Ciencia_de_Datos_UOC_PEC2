I thought I w We were coming down the exit ramp from hwy 255 north bound on new poge road exit near woodriver/edwardsville.  I thought I was looking at a cattle truck at first until what looked to be the shape of an 18 wheeler cattle truck shrunk into a box, grew tall in shape vertically as it was horizontally to the ground, then looked like 2 wind mills on top.  The windmill/spinning action stopped abruptly and began blinking at a heart beat pace.  As the object hovered closer to us much boyfriend grew frightened and he dumped it to 3nd gear then we were out quickly.  As it glided so quietly towards us that we could still hear the crickets chirping, the lights blinked slower and I felt it scanning us...so to speak....which is when the boyfriend jetted and I have never seen anything like it since.;38.8119700767263;-89.9626470588234
