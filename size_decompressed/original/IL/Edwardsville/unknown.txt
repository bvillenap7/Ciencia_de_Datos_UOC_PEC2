My friend and I were driving on Highway 143 towards St. Louis and saw some bright flashing lights in the sky to the side of the road.  We pulled off on Blackburn Road and stopped the car to watch.   There were numerous bright flashing lights putting on quite a light show.  These lights flashed singly and in pairs and then several would appear in a straight line.  At one time the lights turned red and formed a spiral made of a lot of small red lights.  We did take a video and it is quite impressive.  We watched the show for about 45 minutes then continued on our way.  They were still flashing as we left.   There is little out there besides fields and it was very cold around 10 degrees.  I have never seen anything like this in my life. ((NUFORC Note:  We have invited the witness to share the video with our Center.  We may post it, if it is of high-quality.

Thought at first they were stars, but as I watched a little longer, they were moving very slowly in a southwest direction.  It's been a very windy day, but the wind is blowing the opposite direction that the lights were moving.    As I said, the lights were solid, not flashing like aircraft lights.  There were also many stars visible that, of course, weren't moving.   Not sure what they were, but I've never seen anything like that.  I'm really just curious if anyone else saw them, and exactly what they were.   Thanks;38.8119700767263;-89.9626470588234
