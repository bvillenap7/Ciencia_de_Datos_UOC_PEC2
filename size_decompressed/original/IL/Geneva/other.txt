Circular cloud formation surrounding the moon.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probable Moon dog, caused by high-altitude ice crystals.  PD));2005-10-20 23:00:00;15 minutes;Circular cloud formation surrounding the moon. This is not a flying saucer in the classic sense, but it was wierd.   About 11pm I was leaving my house to take my dog for his evening walk, and, as I always do when I walk out of the house, I looked up to check the stars out.  I saw a really strange sight.  It was a perfectly clear, beautiful night, with a full moon.  But when I looked up, there was a perfect circle of clouds surrounding the moon.  Imagine a bull's eye with the moon at the center.  Or a ring surrounding a fixed point, that's what I was staring at.  But it was clouds.  And the moon was at the EXACT center.  The cloud formation had to be a couple of miles in diameter.  I almost thought it must be like the eye of a hurricane, except we had high pressure over us all day and therefore I don't think we would get any type of cloud formation like this.  ' I couldn't stop staring at it as I walked my dog, and by the time we got back fifteen minutes later the formation was being absorbed by other clouds moving in.  It was certainly the strangest weather formation I've ever seen.  Have no idea why this would happen, but thought that someone might find it interesting.
