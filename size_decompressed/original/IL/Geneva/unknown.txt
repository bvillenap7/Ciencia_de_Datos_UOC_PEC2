There were no white or green lights.  There was no sound. There was no sound. My wife and I were going for our evening walk.  We were watching the sky for possible meteors as the Leonids were approaching.  We noticed these two red lights moving from South to North, but could not see any shape of an aircraft with the lights.  The lights were very odd.  They looked diffused.  We had to keep re-focusing on them to keep them in sight even though they were directly overhead and not that far away.  We estimate the lights at an altitude of 10,000 to 20,000 feet based on the planes that were in the sky at that time.  We live about 24 miles from O'Hare airport in Chicago. At any given time, we can see at least a dozen planes in the sky.  The sky was perfectly clear.  The strangest thing was the lack of any sound and the way the lights appeared.  Lights from other planes in the sky at the time were sharply visible.  These were fuzzy. Both my wife and I have college educations and have been in the business world for decades.;41.8847;-88.3028000000001
3 large amber colored lights hovering motionless in the sky.;2006-09-15 20:00:00;10 min.;3 large amber colored lights hovering motionless in the sky. I just exited I-88 and was traveling north on Orchard Rd. near Randall road about 8:00 in the evening on 9/15/06, when 3 large amber colored lights caught my attention well off in the distance and a couple hundred feet or so in the sky. I was driving for about 10 minutes and still couldn't tell exactly where the lights were hovering over, by the time I reached my destination. I'm guessing they were over St. Charles or South Elgin. But what I found so bizarre was that they didn't move at all. At first I thought they might be helicopters doing a search, but there was no searchlight scanning the ground or operating lights on the craft or perhaps light standards like you'd see at a high school football stadium, except there were no supports, and were way too high in the sky. Not only that, but they were just a solid amber colored light, with very little glow around them. I thought for sure other people must be seeing this as there was alot of traffic along Randall road that night. Finally, they just disappeared one by one, from right to left, leaving behind nothing but sky. I contacted the state police, but no one reported seeing anything. Did anyone else see this?;41.8847;-88.3028000000001
