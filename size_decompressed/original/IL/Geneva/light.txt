Light/object in Western Chicago suburbs.  ((NUFORC Note:  Jupiter would be visible in the southeast sky, at this time.  PD));2010-08-17 01:00:00;at least 1 hour;Light/object in Western Chicago suburbs Large star like light in the northeast sky towards Chicago. Moved erratically within a certain area over the sky, if it had stayed still I would have thought it just a large star.  Seemed to be either emitting a light or electric charges or what I saw as possible machine gun fire type light around the light/object. It would quickly move to the direction of the discharged light.  Seemed to be able to move in any direction at what must have been very fast speeds at the distance I saw it from.  Stayed in northeast sky from 1 am when I awoke and went outside first saw it, to about 3 when i was finally able to just stop looking and go to sleep.  So at-least 2 hours.
