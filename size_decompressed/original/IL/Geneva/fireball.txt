Light was constant and did not have the regular blinking of airplane and motion was not in a consistent speed or pattern.  Appeared to be coming in my direction then turned east.  Seemed to hover for several seconds before turning again and heading away from me (south) very fast.;41.8847;-88.3028000000001
