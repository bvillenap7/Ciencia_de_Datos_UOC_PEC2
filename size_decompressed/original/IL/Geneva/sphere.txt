Follow up;2000-05-01 12:00:00;1 minute;Follow up I just entered a report, then continued to look at the website. I saw the main page, and at the bottom it says a blue fireball was seen on the east coast. I just wanted to add, that it looked exactly like that thing that is drawn on the picture someone provided.

Blue Orb seen in Illinois.;2000-07-15 20:00:00;5-6 seconds;Blue Orb seen in Illinois. I was driving with my sister when I was still in high school. It was around 8 I'm guessing, but either way the sun was setting to our right, and in front of us, above the treeline, it looked like a glowing blue orb thing in the sky about a mile away. I pointed it to my sister and she wondered what it was also. We kept driving and the treeline hid the object, when I came to the top of another small hill and saw it again, very clearly, but then the treeline hid it again and then I didn't see it again. It looked pretty big, maybe 60-100ft at what looked like a mile away. It was pretty low in the sky, and was a kind of luminous light blue color, and it seemed a little darker around the edges.
