Glowing zig zags lowering to the ground.;2012-01-30 11:30:00;1-2 min;Glowing zig zags lowering to the ground. Saw two zig zag shapes in the sky, both shapes began lowering.  The shapes were glowing a greenish/yellow color.  One of my friends first pointed this out to me, there were four of us all together that witnessed the shapes.  The zig zags lowered behind the trees, I'm guessing the trees were a couple miles away.   When I tried to get a video of with my cell phone the screen became very blurry and my phone froze up, by the time I restarted my phone the shapes were gone.   They shot back up into the sky.  The shapes seemed to be on the ground or pretty close to it.  All this lasted for about 2 min. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
