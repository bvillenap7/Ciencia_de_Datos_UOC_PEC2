Orange light traveling south along Mississippi River TOTALLY SILENT;2009-08-30 00:22:00;10 minutes;Orange light traveling south along Mississippi River TOTALLY SILENT 5 of us were at Cordova Drag Strip in Cordova IL late Saturday night after a day of racing, we were packing everything up in our trailer at around 12:22 AM when one of our crew said what the HECK IS THAT???????  We all looked up and there was a larger orange/amber light TOTALLY SILENT about 1000 to 2000 feet about the ground maybe a quarter mile east of the track slowly moving south. It was VERY STRANGE.. all of us KNEW it was not a blimp or some human type of aircraft.  It almost looks like a ball of fire yet it was flying.   It was traveling in a direct south direction and as I said was totally silent.  I know it had to be a UFO, all of us did.  I have checked online for any other reports and have not come up with any.  This was by far the trangest thing any of us have every seen.   It took about 10 minutes to travel about 1 mile south of us.  We had a LONG time to try to figure out what it was.  The longer we watched it the more were were convinced it was something NOT from earth.  Really cool to see and I'm glad I wasn't alone and then having people think I was crazy.
