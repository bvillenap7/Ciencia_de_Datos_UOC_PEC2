My fiancée’ and I seen a triangle shaped craft hovering about 75ft. above the ground with a clear light on the nose, red light on the right corner, and green light on the left corner.  The object was all black and made no noise as it just hovered there.  It was also a very windy night and as we were driving down the highway when we first saw the craft it was swaying back and forth but as we drove under the craft it was as still as can be.  This incident lasted only one to two minutes and after we passed under the craft and I looked back to see if it was still there it was gone.  Where we seen this UFO was right outside of town in a semi populated area I don’t think there were any other witnesses because the only other car was my mom and she was on the cell phone and did not see it.
