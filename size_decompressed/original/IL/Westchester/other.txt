Sighting of what appeared to be a silver metallic flying object which had a very distinctive shape.  Unlike an airplane, strangely enough, it looked like the structure on top of the Capitol Building in Washington D.C. and I witnessed that it was spinning fast and moving forward at the same time.  I could only see one but there could have been more.  It was late at night just before midnight, and I was getting ready to go to sleep.  I saw different color lights and no sound of any kind.  The entire event did not last more than 10-15 seconds.  The only thing that I thought was strange is that during the sighting of this object, I heard strange voices in my head which sounded like a different language, but a language that is totaly different and not from this world.  Then, as the object disappeared, the voices also stopped.;41.8508;-87.8791000000001
