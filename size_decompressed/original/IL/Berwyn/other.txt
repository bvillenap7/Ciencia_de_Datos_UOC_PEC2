It was a small pin prick of light, unlike a star, or satellite, only much much brighter. i first saw it in the north west sky then it quickly moved to the southern, then eastern sky it was blinking the whole time and each time it blinked it was in a new location. this object was moving faster than anything man made (that i know of). And i am 100% sure it was not a firefly. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));41.8388;-87.7891
