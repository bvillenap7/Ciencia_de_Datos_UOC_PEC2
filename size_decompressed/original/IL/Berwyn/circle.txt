I am not a believer in any Alien/UFO stuff but, I live in Chicago, Illinois and on July 3rd, 2010 (yesterday) the ring that was seen at point 0:44-0:59 is the SAME EXACT cloud looking ring I and many others in my family spotted in the sky right over Berwyn, Illinois. <object width=480 height=385><param name=movie value=http://www.youtube.com/v/3PrOB2e9jbw&amphl=en_US&ampfs=1></param><param name=allowFullScreen value=true></param><param name=allowscriptaccess value=always></param><embed src=http://www.youtube.com/v/3PrOB2e9jbw&amphl=en_US&ampfs=1 type=application/x-shockwave-flash allowscriptaccess=always allowfullscreen=true width=480 height=385></embed></object>   Now&#65279 many were quick to jump to the possibility that is was smoke forming the shape of a ring due to the fireworks that were being blown off.  However, I beg to differ because this ring shaped object was PERFECTLY round.  Also the ring was moving at a very fast pace. The wind was very very still at the time.  Since this occurance I am interested in&#65279 what it was or may be.  Like I said before, I did strongly not believe in Aliens/UFO's.   But this time I was very quick to doubt it was smoke from the fireworks. The reason being is when someone makes a ring of smoke with their cigarette the ring will gradually get bigger and rise.  Whereas this CLOUDY like ring was moving across the sky.;41.8388;-87.7891
