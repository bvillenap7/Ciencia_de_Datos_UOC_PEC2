A bright light, like that of a candle over the city of Berwyn, IL.;2005-08-01 20:00:00;5 min;A bright light, like that of a candle over the city of Berwyn, IL. It was a clear summer night while I was driving home with my ex,when we noticed a group of people gazing at a bright light in the sky at approximately 400ft high. the light was circular and white but without a shape.  It was about 30ft in diameter.we decided to stop and find out what it was. The light appeared to be like that of a candle. It hovered for five minutes then disappeared. It then appeared a few meters away from where it was.  I then realized this UFO was definitively not an aircraft of any kind.the light finally disappeared as it moved away.;41.8388;-87.7891

I WAS SLEEPING ON MY COUCH IN THE LIVING ROOM  I HEARD A VERY STRANGE NOISE LIKE SOMETHING FALLING OR RISING FROM THE SKY, SOMETHING LIKE A PLANE BUT IT WASNT A PLANE.   AS I HEARD THIS NOISE I GET UP FROM THE COUCH AND I LOOK AT MY WINDOWS AND A VERY BRIGHT RED LIGHT CONSUMED MY ENTIRE LIVING ROOM EVEN THOUGH I HAVE DRAPES IT WENT RIGHT THRU REALLY BRIGHT RED.   I THEN OPENED MY FRONT DOOR AND I LOOK STRAIGHT TO THE STREET AND THAT LIGHT RAPIDLY STARTED TO FADE AND IT KIND OF SHOT UP IN AN ANGLE AND THE LIGHT KIND OF TRAILED THEN  DISSAPEARED.;41.8388;-87.7891
