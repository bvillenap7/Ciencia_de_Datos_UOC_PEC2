At one point the lights seemed to stop and just sat there in the sky Above our homes for a good I would say 4 to 5 minutes and then they seem to meet back at a certain spot and then the lights started blinking and flashing while the other lights did not!there had to be a total of about anywhere from 7 to 9 lights!!!  And then when they were finished one by one they shot off at a high rate of speed heading northeast from our position towards Lake Michigan!!!!  We've noticed a lot of activity in Berwyn but this by far was the craziest!!!! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));41.8388;-87.7891
