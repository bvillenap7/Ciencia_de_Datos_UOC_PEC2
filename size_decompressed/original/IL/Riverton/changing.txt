An x shaped ufo seemed to change shape.;2006-04-28 12:00:00;5 minutes;An x shaped ufo seemed to change shape. About noon on Friday 4-28-06 a co-worker pointed out an object in the sky. We were in Riverton, Illinois at the time. The object was west of us and seemed to be between our location and Springfield which is about 5 miles away. It was moving slowly to the north. We both agreed that it apperared to be changing shape. It looked like an x or a cross with the top cross member slowly rotating. There also seemed to be a space between the two parts. It was pointed out to a third person but they did'nt seem to be interested. The sighting lasted about 3 to five minutes.
