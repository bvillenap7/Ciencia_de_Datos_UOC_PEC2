Strange object reflecting the light  the morning sun.  ((NUFORC Note:  Case from MUFON Case Management System.  PD));2014-07-01 10:50:00;<1 minute;Strange object reflecting the light  the morning sun. The witness was heading north on Cass Ave. to get on the highway to go to work.  At the time he was driving past the property that Argon National Lab is located on.  He first noticed the object because it was reflecting the sunlight in a way that seemed to make it glitter easily visible against the clear blue sky.   At first he thought the object was a plane but thought it was strange that it was reflecting light in the way it was.  Upon further observation he determined that the object didn't seem to be following any sort of linear path, but instead seemed to be maintaining its position for the entire duration of the observation.  The object appeared to be a thin elliptical shape that was spinning along its horizontal axis.  After watching it for less than a minute he decided to call a family member and tell them what he was seeing.  Almost as soon as he had that thought, the object instantly vanished from sight leaving no trace that it had been there. (MUFON 57528);41.7416;-87.9375
