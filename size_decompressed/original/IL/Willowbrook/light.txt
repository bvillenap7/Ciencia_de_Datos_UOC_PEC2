I was heading west on Bluff Road in willowbrook, IL, heading towards argonne nationall laboratory around 4:00 pm when I seen what appeard to be a very big and bright light in the sky almost resembling a big star.    As I was looking at the light a second one appeard next two it at a distance of 100 feet from my view point and shortly after that one appeard a third one appeard at the same distance.  All three objects were in a perfect straight line and evenly spaced.  The objects disappeard at the same time shortly after they all were visible.
