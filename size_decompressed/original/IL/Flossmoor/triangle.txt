Triangular Shaped UFOs with Lights Silently Hovering in the Western Sky in Illinois.;2014-01-14 02:00:00;30-60 minutes;Triangular Shaped UFOs with Lights Silently Hovering in the Western Sky in Illinois I and another adult witness observed at least 5 (five) triangular-shaped objects (possibly UFOs) in the Western, Southwestern, and Eastern skies in Illinois at approximately 2:00 AM on January 14, 2014.  One UFO was positioned just above a tree line in the Southwestern sky from my vantage point, and considerably closer than the others.  I was standing on the ground, in my driveway, in a residential area, not in a vehicle. It was a clear night, and the moon was nearly full.  The objects appeared to be stationary in a triangular formation above and on either side of the moon (looking westward).    The UFO in the East was positioned by itself and at a further observed distance from the others.  None of the objects moved initially nor made any detectable sound during approximately 30 minutes of observation. After approximately 30 minutes, one of the objects did disappear, silently, from above the tree line and was not observable from my vantage point.  However, there was no sound emanating from that area once the object was gone from my sight line. I attempted to take cell phone pictures, but they were not clear or distinct enough to detect triangularity, just objects of light.  The entire event was still ongoing at approximately 3:00 AM on 1/14/2014, but I went to sleep at that point.
