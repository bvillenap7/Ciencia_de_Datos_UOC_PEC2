Reflective triangle flew extremely fast;2012-07-20 17:05:00;20 seconds;Reflective triangle flew extremely fast On Friday, July 20, 2012, at 5:05 P.M., I was driving east on Illinois highway 173.  I was just east of Poplar Grove, Illinois.  I noticed a triangular shaped object below some clouds.  It was silver and very reflective like a mirror.  It was smooth and shaped like an arrow head.  As it moved very rapidly, it changed positions and the sun reflected off of it like a mirror.  It was flying north and then shifted quickly and flew east.  The end of it was blunt and was somewhat of a diamond shape.  It left no smoke trail or any other signs of propulsion.  As soon as it turned east, it flew away extremely fast and disappeared.  The sighting lasted about 20 seconds or less.;42.3634;-88.8432
