TWO brightly lit UFO's spotted near Poplar Grove, IL;2003-09-30 22:34:00;10 Minutes;TWO brightly lit UFO's spotted near Poplar Grove, IL I was heading East on Rt. 173 toward Poplar Grove, IL. When I reached the vicinity of Caledonia, IL I witnessed two objects or craft that appeared to be planes with their landing lights on. As I continued driving I realized that the objects were not coming my direction. I thought they may be heading East also but yet the lights should not have been facing my direction.. (??) As I continued and reached Poplar Grove, I realized I was closing in on the craft as they appeared larger and much brighter. I continued past Poplar Grove East and the craft was fairly large and bright and appeared to be stationary (Hovering). I assumed it was Helicopters. I turned right onto Beaverton Rd, and shut the headlights off and got out and looked up. The objects were to the South. I saw two planes flying in the vacinity and suddenly the two objects shot straight up to the sky and within 5 seconds or so became as distant as the stars themselves.(Very faint light but visible). The distance traveled in time was incredible. It appeared that the craft flew 200-250 miles upward in a matter of 5 seconds. (I know that this must defy our most current-to-date physics????) The Craft that I saw did not have blue or red lights on them as far as I could see so they did not appear to be planes at all. As I said, there was two other planes flying in the vacinity which circled around and flew South-West toward Rockford Airport direction. I would find it hard to believe that the pilots did not witness this also but I can't prove or dis-prove that. All I know is what I saw, which I cannot explain.;42.3634;-88.8432
