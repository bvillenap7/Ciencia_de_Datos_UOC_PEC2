UFO fleet witnessed in Southern Illinois, during the summer of 2009.;2009-06-10 14:30:00;1 minute;UFO fleet witnessed in Southern Illinois, during the summer of 2009. 	I am not absolutely certain of the date in which I experienced this sighting. Although I do know for certain that it occurred in the summer of 2009. The following is absolute fact, and has convinced me that we are not alone in the universe. 	While driving westbound on Illinois Route 148 from Mt. Vernon, Illinois about two miles before reaching Waltonville, an inner voice spoke to me. “Look up if you want to see us,” crossed my mind. An unseen female voice was speaking within my male body, and seemed to not be coming from my own mind. I immediately leaned over the steering wheel, looking upward through the windshield. Seeing nothing unusual I thought to myself,”I don’t see anything.” Immediately a response came from that internal female voice,”Keep looking.” I again focused harder on the same area of sky and I could barely make out a large grouping of silver, circular shaped objects flying at high altitude. 	Upon seeing the objects I pulled the vehicle over to the shoulder of the highway, in order to more safely view the objects. I would estimate the objects’ altitude at approximately 40,000 feet. The altitude was of the height that if it were any greater, the objects would have been undetectable by the naked eye. They seemed to be flying in a group some coming together into small groupings and flying around each other. I watched for a minute or so and they drifted out of view. What I saw could not have been balloons, because balloons don’t speak to people telepathically. 	Here is a video link I found on youtube, which was filmed in Mexico, this is EXACTLY what I saw while driving in Southern Illinois. Although an exact representation of what I witnessed, it is not a video of my sighting. 	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCX_WoD3NfE;38.2096;-89.0345
