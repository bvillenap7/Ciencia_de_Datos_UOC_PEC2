Bright orange lights sighted in Apple River, Illinois;2009-09-04 20:00:00;5 minutes;Bright orange lights sighted in Apple River, Illinois I was traveling east on Stagecoach Trail, just east of the town of Apple River, Ilinois when in the northern sky - just above where the horizon would be in daylight - I noticed two series of orange lights, one over the other. There must have been aproximately 6 orange lights in the top series and at least 10 orange lights in the bottom series. The lights either merged or one got behind the other and the lights began moving eastward and appeared to rise and disappeared in the eastern sky. I can best describe the orange lights as if one was observing a cruise ship out at sea and could just see the port holes on the side of the ship in the darkness. I noted in a web search that similar lights were observed - among other locations - in Rockford, Illinois - about 65 miles east of Apple River, Illinos. It felt good to get a confirmation of my sighting as this never happened to me prior to this time.;42.4762;-90.1171
