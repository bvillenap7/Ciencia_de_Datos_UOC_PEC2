I got up to look and saw the same thing, a ball of fire stationary in one spot not moving around, she ran inside and got binoculars but we could not hold them steady enough and it was quit aways off to see exactly what it could be.  The light seemed to flicker out and that was all we saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));42.2422;-88.6247
