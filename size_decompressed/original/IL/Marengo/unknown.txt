6-10 lights moving in the distance;2012-01-03 19:06:00;5 minutes;6-10 lights moving in the distance I was taking our dogs out, and noticed a bunch of lights in the distance.  One seemed brighter, which is what initially drew my eyes to the area, when I noticed several other lights. I initially thought there was a bad accident in the nearby town, and these were helicopters circling above, but for as far away as the lights were, they were moving much too fast. After taking pictures for about 5 minutes, I decided to check  Twitter & the local newspapers to see if there had been any other people mention this incident. I hadnâ€™t seen anything, and when I went back to look at the lights, they were gone.;42.2422;-88.6247
