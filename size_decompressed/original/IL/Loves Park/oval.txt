Photos of an object in the sky;2011-02-23 01:15:00;2 minutes;Photos of an object in the sky I was testing out my new camera for night photography, and seen an interesting object in the sky.  I witnessed it looking north west in the sky. The object was moving eastward.  The sky was cloudy outside.  The object was oval shaped and glowed a blueish tint and had a light underneath it. Well several lights, but one in the middle. It glided across the sky.  I will attach the original photos, so you can see the object.;42.3294;-89.0325
