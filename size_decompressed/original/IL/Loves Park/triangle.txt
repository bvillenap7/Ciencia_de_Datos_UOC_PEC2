Trianglular object no sound flew over us as we were looking at stars.;2000-07-15 22:00:00;est 3 minutes;Trianglular object no sound flew over us as we were looking at stars. The date and time is estimate. It was in mid july 2000 around 9-10 pm.  A friend and me Went down to the local school field so we could look at the stars. We layed down in the field looking up at the stars. we layed there bout 20 minutes and we noticed an object moving from west to east in the sky. We thought it was a plane at a distance, but as it moved closer we noticed it was a triangular shaped object. There was 4 lights on it total. 3 on the corners and 1 underneath it. It flew directly over us. What made it even more odd was there was NO sound to it at all. It was probably a few hundred feet in the air. And the size would be of an average passenger plane. It traveled eastward without no sound. It was traveling in a straight line. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));42.3294;-89.0325
triangle object hovering above field next to me then dissappeared;2003-12-11 17:30:00;20 minutes;triangle object hovering above field next to me then dissappeared my experince was on 12/12/03 in loves park , illinois around 17:30 - 17:40. i was walking in the country for my daily walk. i always look at the stars. i seen an object appear in the north sky traveling southward. it had 3 lights in a trianglur shape. it was moving slowly across the sky. it then hovered above the feild i was next to. it was maybe 100-300 feet off of the ground. i could see it clearly. it was dark in color. the lights were yellowish, i was kind of scared because i have never seen an object like this before. as it hovered i didn't observe any noise. not even a hum. it looked like about the size of a small airplane. it started moving south then all of a sudden it turned northeast in a fast rate of speed. then traveled northeast. there was a car that stopped to watch this object also. it then turned back southward then traveled really fast then all of a sudden just dissappeared. no sound what so ever. the lights were in a triangular shape, one light on each corner of the object. my sighting lasted about 20 minutes total but seemed to last longer. i have seen airplanes and satelittes,ballons,meteors,all of that before but have never encountered anything like this before. really wierd and scarry. i didn't tell noone yet because i don't think noone will believe me. how do you tell someone you just seen a triagular object hovering over a field next to you. thats why i am reporting this to this site. that way you know about this and this is in your guys expertise area.;42.3294;-89.0325
Triangle object with 3 lights , disappeared behind cloud;2008-02-18 19:30:00;3 minutes;Triangle object with 3 lights , disappeared behind cloud Hi, Feb. 18th at 7:30 in Loves Park,IL. I was looking east in the sky, i noticed a light, i thought was an airplane at first. I was watching it, it was moving west at a slow rate of speed. As it came closer i noticed that it was not a plane. It was triangle in shape. It had lights on all 3 points. And 2 underneath it. They did not blink. They were white in color. As i watched it, and it moved closer, a cloud floated over the object, and it never came out of the cloud. I sat around watching for it, around another 30 minutes afterwards trying to see if i can see the object. It never reappeared.;42.3294;-89.0325
