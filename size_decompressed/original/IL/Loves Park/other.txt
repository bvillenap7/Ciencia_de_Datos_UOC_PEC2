Aircraft & Contrail fade away and disappear.;2019-06-02 20:30:00;~1 minute;Aircraft & Contrail fade away and disappear. We witnessed an airplane disappear. We were sitting outside around 8:30 pm.  An airplane was traveling west to east in the sky.  It had a nice contrail behind it as it came across the sky. As it came across all of a sudden the aircraft AND the contrail disappeared.  It like faded away.  Was weird to witness. There was no clouds in the sky so it did not disappear behind a cloud.  It just literally faded away and disappeared. No sound, but normally with aircraft that high you do not hear them anyways. The sun did reflect off of it, but couldn't tell about any aircraft on the lights. I own a very good ads-b setup here at the house.  I quickly came to check out what aircraft it was.  And there was no aircraft on the adsb-b in this area at the time.  None that were traveling in the area or direction. So to put a long story short:  We witnessed an airplane flying in the sky from west to east.  I do not want to approx. the altitude.  But the sun was shining off the aircraft and had a strong contrail behind it.  Then it faded away above us, without a cloud in the sky.  The airplane AND the contrail just faded away and disappeared.  And there was nothing on my ads-b tracker. I did take a video of it with the cell phone.  But with it being a cell phone, I do not know how the quality will be. About us:  We frequently watch the skies and know what is normal in the skies.  We frequently watch the skies for the airplanes.;42.3294;-89.0325
