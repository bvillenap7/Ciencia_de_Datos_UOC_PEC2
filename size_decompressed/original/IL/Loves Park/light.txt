Object moves across the sky, and then hovers.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Venus??  PD));2015-09-25 06:20:00;5 minutes;Object moves across the sky, and then hovers. I walked outside at 6:20 am and saw a light in the sky.  The light reminded me of the ISS or a satellite, but much brighter.   It was almost above me just to my south.  It was moving from the West to the SouthWest.  It was moving at a slow/medium pace.  As I said, I thought it was the ISS or satellite.   There was no sound or visible features.  But the thing that happened next, convinced me it was not.   As it was moving, it just stopped and hovered.  I sat there and watched it for approx 6 minutes as it hovered in the sky.  It was doing a rocking motion.  The light was still bright but the size was just slightly smaller than when I first saw it. The ISS, Satellite, Chinese Lanterns, etc... Do NOT move and then stop and hover.;42.3294;-89.0325
