Burnt orange egg shaped craft seen hovering over field about 20 miles NW of Rockford Illinois, with a light projecting down.;2001-06-14 21:30:00;30 minutes;Burnt orange egg shaped craft seen hovering over field about 20 miles NW of Rockford Illinois, with a light projecting down. My daughter reprots that on the evening of Thursday around 9:30 pm she was in her house and noticed a light thru her kitchen window. Her 5 year old son was watching TV at the time with her. She walked out her front door and down a small flight of stairs and proceeded to walk about 30 feet out into her driveway. She looked to the East and there across Boswell Road floating above her neighbors field were three, or four, egg shaped burnt orange lights hovering above the ground. They were perfectly silent and motionless. They stood perfectly still. She watched for some time then ran inside to get a camera but found the batteries dead. She called the neighbor in whose field they were hovering and told her to hurry and look outside. The neighbor ran outside but forgot to take her glasses. My daughter ran back outside and spotted a flashlight at the objects. This action caused one of the lights to suddenly shine a strong powerful light directly down toward the ground. The light came over at my daughter who immediately ran inside. On going inside she also noticed one of the craft silently dart off toward her house and steak away. Whatever happened she doesn't know but the TV suddenly popped and shut off and a humidefier like divice also quit operating. My daughter called the local radio station AND REPORTED what she saw. There were other callers who also reported the sightings. I understand she now has seen the craft another time and has taken a photograph.;42.4526;-89.0899
