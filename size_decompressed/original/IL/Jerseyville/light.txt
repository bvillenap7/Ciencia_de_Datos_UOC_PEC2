A moving, brightly lit object was about the cross the highway in front of my but vanished.;1998-12-09 06:25:00;one minute;A moving, brightly lit object was about the cross the highway in front of my but vanished. I was driving south on Route 267 this morning at sunrise when I noticed a light to the right side of the highway. It was the only object in the sky in that direction and appeared to be the brightness of a planet. However, it moved west to east. It was about to cross the plane of the highway when I looked down to the radio for the time. At that point, I looked up and it had disappeared. There was no remnant. No flashing light. Nothing. The sun was not up, only an orange band in the east.;39.1188;-90.3294
