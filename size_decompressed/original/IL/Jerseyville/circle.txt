Round blue ball light descending down to the ground by my house.;2014-04-05 22:20:00;5 seconds;Round blue ball light descending down to the ground by my house. I was looking out of my north window of my living room and saw a round ball like blue light that was descending down to the ground in the field by my yard.  It was very close to my house it looked as if it went into the woods right by my house.  The size was a little bigger than a basketball.  It was moving slowly enough that I watched it go into the woods by my house.  It was not moving fast and quick, just flowing down to the ground.  I went out on Sunday to look around the field by the woods and couldn't get close enough with the ranger because of the mud from all the rain we just got.  Just gave up looking because of the fields being so muddy, I didnâ€™t want to walk either.  Just thought maybe it was a shooting star.  Until I Saw the news on the 16th of April (Channel 2 St Louis) and saw these blue balls that someone else saw thought maybe I should tell someone about what I saw that Saturday night around 10:20 pm.;39.1188;-90.3294
