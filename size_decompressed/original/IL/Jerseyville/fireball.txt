Red fireball crashing into a field;2011-11-26 17:05:00;2 mins;Red fireball crashing into a field We were driving towards Jerseyville from Carrolton on 267 about 10 mins outside of Jerseyville when we seen a red fireball in the sky.  It crashed into the field, it caught fire, then my kids seen another fireball come out the sky and crash as well.  We didn't stop because it was raining and it was way out in a field. but when we got to the out skirts of Jerseyville we seen the police with lights on head that way.  Not sure what it could have been.  I tried looking at the telegraph but no stories on it.;39.1188;-90.3294
