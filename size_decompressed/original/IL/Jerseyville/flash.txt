super fast strobe light over jerseyville ,Il summer of 1992;1992-07-05 03:00:00;3 seconds;super fast strobe light over jerseyville ,Il summer of 1992 during the summer of 1992 i was now camping with several neighbor kids from jerseyville,Il when we observed an amazing light that flew from the horizon on the west directly over us and out of sight to the east in only about 3 seconds. we were all looking to the sky on a clear summer night when an brilliant flash went off on the west horizon, went out and then flashed just west of jerseyville approaching us one more time. the light went out again and then appeared one more time flashing once over our neighbors house. the object was headed east and was never seen again. ironically one of my buddies said he grew up 30 min. north of jerseyville said he and his brother had observed strange objects there and military planes looking for them afterwards. minutes later while we were still there a large military prop plane arrived and had very loud engines like those of a c-130 or similar and cirlced the area for approx 5-7 minutes and then left as quick as it appeared. the light we had seen was extremely fast and appeared to be operated by something or someone and not a natural occurence. the best way to explain it was like a giant flash from a giant camera fling over the sky a nd taking pictures at almost light speed?
