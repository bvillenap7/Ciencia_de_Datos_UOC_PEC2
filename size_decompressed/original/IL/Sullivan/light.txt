bright light fading to moving light;2002-08-03 22:15:00;10 seconds;bright light fading to moving light My husband and I first noticed a bright light high in the sky among the stars.  It appeared to become quite a bit brighter then it faded very quickly to a moving light (similar to an airplane, except it had no blinking lights).  The light was white and the only changes were in the intensity.  It didn't appear to move until after the intensity faded.  This happened twice in a 15 minute period.  There were also 4 meteors during a half-hour period from about 10:00 p.m. to 10:30 p.m., as well as other aircraft with the usual flashing light.;39.5923;-88.5968
a series of  reddish/orange glow-type lights;2007-08-31 20:50:00;10 minutes;a series of  reddish/orange glow-type lights A reddish-orange glow or light appeared just over the treetops to the sse from our front porch.  One appeared for a about 5 seconds and then disappeared.  Then another one appeared about 30 seconds later in a different location - same general position over the treetops but to the right of the last one.  That lasted about 5 seconds and then disapppeared and then immediately another one appeared at a distance of several miles from the last one to the left.  This went on for about 10 minutes and we saw a total of approximately 8 altogether.  The light did not fade in anyway.  It just appeared and then disappeared.  It did not move whatsoever.  There was no arcing or pulsating.  We saw a falling star to the east of us during this time, also.  We also saw a white light similar to a plane to our north moving westward about 9:15 p.m. that appeared to bounce along and did not pulsate or flash like other planes did in the same area.;39.5923;-88.5968
