3 disc shaped objects;2010-11-05 18:10:00;5 mins;3 disc shaped objects I just took a smoke break from working on a research project for one of my college courses.  I stepped out on the front porch, which faces south, and happened to glance to the west.  There is a power line that goes across the street.  Flanking the power line were two disc shaped objects that glowed with a brilliant yellowish-white hue.  I watched them for a few minutes and noticed that these objects were moving, not with the scattered cloud cover, but diagonally towards the earth.   I moved a little bit to try to get a better look and then noticed 4 - 5 jets flying high altitude with vapor trails. 1 of the jet's went by near the objects. 2 went by closer to my location.  And another went by further behind the objects. The one that went behind the objects was extremely noticeable as it literally went behind the object.  Finally, as I finished my cigarette and decided to come into report - I saw yet a third disc shaped object.  I came in and told my partner's dad.  We both went out and looked and the three objects and the jets were all gone. I'm baffled.;39.5923;-88.5968
