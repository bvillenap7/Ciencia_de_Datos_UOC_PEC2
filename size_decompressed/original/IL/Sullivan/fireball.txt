I walk into the house as my dad calls me out to see this burning ball that as it moved it left a strange trail.  Also, it was dropping something from its bottom, multiple objects dropped and disappeared.   Then the burning ball slowely started flickering and disappeared.  It scared us both so I ran in the house to grab my camera.  Then tried to film it but it started to fade.;39.5923;-88.5968
