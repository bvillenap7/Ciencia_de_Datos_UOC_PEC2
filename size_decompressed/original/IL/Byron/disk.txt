My friend and I used to hang out nearly every day and as young teenagers tend to do, we would stay up into the wee hours of the night. We were in my friends basement one night watching a movie and all of a sudden there was a rumbling. Not a rumbling akin to an earthquake but more like if you live near a subway or airport. About twenty seconds after the rumbling started we started hearing a whistling noise that sounded almost exactly like the old sound clips they would play when dropping a bomb or heavy object. Naturally we were on high alert as were the dogs he had, they were going absolutely nuts. About ten seconds after we started to hear the whistling noise we saw a craft no more than 40 feet off the ground, right above the tree line. We watched the craft slowly hover away at a speed that you could keep up on a bicycle. We both have this very, very strange feeling, all the hairs standing up, the kind of feeling when you know *something* is wrong but don’t! know what exactly.  At this point we are absolutely terrified and decide to pack up and move into my friend’s room (the next room over from where we were watching the movie) In the process of picking up or pillows and popcorn my friend was frozen, like a deer in headlights, staring out the window. He didn’t point, didn’t move, hardly reacted and quietly told me to look out the window. As I drew closer to the window I could see there clear as day what appeared to be a man staring back in at us. He looked like your average Joe except that you could see through him as if he was a ghost. I quickly pulled the shades and we both ran into his room and didn’t speak about the encounter ever again.;42.1292;-89.2702
