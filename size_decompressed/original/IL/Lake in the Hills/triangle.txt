On August 20, 2004 from 10:25 to 10:27 pm we witnessed a triangular shaped object moving across the sky from a north to south direction.  The event only lasted maybe 3 minutes.  It was right over our heads. Not very high at all.  The length of the object may have been large enough to allow three large commercial airplanes in it. At first glance it looked as though it was three lights traveling simultaneously across the sky.  However, I looked at this object through Tasco mini binoculars.  I then was surprised to see this was one large object with three lights located on each corner. I need to add that I saw this object tilt toward the west and then level off.  Now I have grown up in Elk Grove Village with a commercial flight path over the top of my parentsâ€™ home since I was two years old.  I have seen probably every type of plane and size.  This was something that I have never seen before.  My wife agrees that this was the strangest object we have ever seen.  What is most interesting is this object only stayed in sight for maybe three minutes.  It completely vanished right in front of us.  I don't know if it went up or we just lost it in the cloud haze.  The night was partial cloudy and then clear allowing visibility to the night stars for a while. Then a haze would roll through for short time and obstruct a clear view of the night sky. This is why I say we don't know if we just lost it in the cloudy haze rolling through.  My wife says the object did not fade into a cloudy haze.  I was busy trying to setup a telescope to look at this object closer.  I never got the chance.  We have no idea what this was, if someone does let us know.  That is all the information I have to give.  I wish I had some night vision video or camera that I could have taken a picture of this thing with but I don't.  I won't forget what I just saw!!;42.1845;-88.3266

Strange glowing orange orb UFO lights northwest Chicago il;2011-09-17 20:45:00;15 min;Strange glowing orange orb UFO lights northwest Chicago il Last night I witnessed for 10 minutes large orange orb lights in northwest il at 8:45-9:00 at night. First ones started out in a triangle formation, then single orbs.  Appeared to be flying by pretty fast, no noise, no trails.  There were lightning type flashes in the beginning.  After the orbs were done, the sky had a strange streaky cloud formation in the same path of the orbs. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6o-c2aZjKCM;42.1845;-88.3266
