One word, weird.;2015-11-14 07:45:00;5 minutes;One word, weird. Me and two other family members saw 7 orange light balls flying over our local park and storage unit facility.  Then they flew over the airport and disapeared out of are sight.  They also made no noises.  We are very worried and intrigued by this event.
