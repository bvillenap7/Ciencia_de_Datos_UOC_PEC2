This is about 16miles from the downtown Chicago and they were only about 1,500-2,000’ (lower?) (I am an architect with no flying experience…). They were silent, moving from North directly South and changed color from red to orange and back again. The speed was pretty much like a steady news-helicopter-very steady yet not speedy. The silence was obvious. They were sizable enough and ovoid enough to get my attention while on a call with a client. They remained about a ¼ mile (perhaps a bit more) apart the whole time. I was on Dempster Avenue headed East and turned South onto Austin Avenue, stopped, got out of my car to get a better look.  It was eerie and this would have to be my first legitimate UFO siting of my life!  My wife, angered at the risk of my stopping, was a witness (though she remained in the car).;42.0431;-87.7899
