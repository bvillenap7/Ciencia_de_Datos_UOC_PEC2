Big yellow ball in a hurry...;2005-02-12 23:53:00;2 seconds;Big yellow ball in a hurry... On February 12th, 2005 at approximately 11:53PM I was out for a country drive by myself on an unknown road just north of the village of Stonefort, IL. when a large bright yellow (amber) sphere shot across the sky from the NNW toward the SSE. I am not a velosity expert by far, but I would have calcalated by the distance covered in the approximate two (2) seconds of visual exposure that the object was traveling between 15,000 and 24,000 MPH. This was not a meteor, due to the fact that anyone    who(m) has studied meteors, knows that meteors have tails and that depending on their composition what colours are present. i.e. stone meteors are white and have white tails, copper shows as green, oxygen-red...etc. This area of the country is virtually free of flight paths, so when something does fly by on a clear night be it commercial, military, or other, it tends to stand out. Also, I am originally from Chicago and have lived in many metropolitan centres on this planet ,as well as spent 13 years on Navy and Marine Bases and Air Stations. I know manmade aircraft when I, either see it, or hear it. This object was silent. Was anyone else fortunate enough to witness this object other than me?;37.6443;-88.6248
