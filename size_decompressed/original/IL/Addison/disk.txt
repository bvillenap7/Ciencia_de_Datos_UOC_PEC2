Saucer shaped object,with rows of red lights on bottom side one white lighttop and bottom;1999-10-11 22:30:00;10 minutes;Saucer shaped object,with rows of red lights on bottom side one white lighttop and bottom Hovering saucer, with rows of red lights on bottom,one white light top and bottom observed. Numerous cars(20 or so) [both directions], also stopped, some drivers were observed using their cell phones,looking up at object.  Object then slowly moved in a Southerly direction. ((NUFORC Note:  We later spoke with a police officer from the Addison Police Department, who had seen the same object.  He identified the object as an advertising blimp, and suggested that he saw advertising text on its side.  However, just prior to this sighting, a very interesting event was reported from KS, MO, AR, and KY, which makes us wonder about this one.  It seems to us unusual that some 20 automobiles would stop to look at a blimp, and that no one among that population of witnesses would recognize the object as a blimp.  Also, a former member of the USAF witnessed something nearby in Illinois at about the same time, and he declared it to be one of the most interesting and bizarre objects he has ever witnessed.  He said his impression was that whatever he witnessed, it almost certainly was not from the planet earth.));41.9345;-88.0039999999999
