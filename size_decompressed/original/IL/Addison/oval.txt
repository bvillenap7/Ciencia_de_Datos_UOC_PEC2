Oval shape craft with 2 extremely large bright pulsating lights.;2011-11-24 21:33:00;8 minutes;Oval shape craft with 2 extremely large bright pulsating lights. On Thanksgiving night I observed a oval shape craft with extremely large lights, sort of like bugs eye on the side of the craft. Its lights changed from white to red mimicking a regular craft, although several other colors were also a factor such as amber, blue, burgandy, and green... The colors seem to Pulsate and move around the craft on a clockwise motion assuming there were identicle lights on the opposite side of what I witness.  It made no noise and the only craft it could be compared to would be a blimp, but it was going extremely too rapidt.  The light were larger that what I can make out of the craft. Traveled from east going westbound toward Streamwood until I lost sight of it.;41.9345;-88.0039999999999
