It was extremely bright and was swiftly moving through the sky north east toward south east. The object made no noise as it continue its path.  It looked as if it was a star but imagine it 1/6th of a full moon, the moon was full so I was able to compare it to the moon.  No other visible lights came from this orb, it was like bright almost ice blue, more white than blue but bright and it just disappeared as it traveled.  I then witness a chopper about a minute after the sighting heading toward the same area I lost vision of the orb. I Remained outside for the next couple hours and didn't see anything else.
