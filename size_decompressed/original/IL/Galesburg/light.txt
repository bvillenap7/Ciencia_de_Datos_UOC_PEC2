2 Fast, Small, Yellow Orbs.;2002-05-20 20:00:00;5 secants;2 Fast, Small, Yellow Orbs. 2 Yellow Orbs floated around my brothers window as I was watching television. I turned to look out the window, and there they were. They only were there for 3-4 seconds, then dissapeard. This has happened once before as well. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

bright light became much larger  ((NUFORC Note:  Probably Iridium satellite.  PD));2005-03-07 18:15:00;10 sec.;bright light became much larger I stepped out the back of the house to call the cat. I heard a jet pass and when I looked up I thought I was looking at a star to the north of the airplane that had just passed. It suddenely became about 20 times larger than it first appeared in a matter of a few seconds, was extremely bright like an auto headlight. It then moved off to the NE away from me and simply faded out. I could not see any shape other than a round bright light.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probably Iridium satellite.  PD));40.9509;-90.3658
Formation of 3 light in a triangle, one moved quicky, then they dimmed out, real bright.;2007-09-17 21:15:00;3 minutes;Formation of 3 light in a triangle, one moved quicky, then they dimmed out, real bright. I saw a formation of lights 3 in a triangle space apart about 4 inches (if the sky was a piece of paper) They looked like this: 0(a)     0(b)         0(c) The c moved about right next to b, then blinked out for about 2 seconds and came back on. Then c slowly dimmed out then followed by, b and then a. Each dimming was about 5 seconds apart from each other. I and some other people have seen these lights during this year. They appear for about 10 minutes (not moving) then dim out. They twice as big as a star and are REALLY bright.

An unusually bright light moved across the sky and disappeared about 30 degrees off the horizon.;2008-09-21 19:59:00;1 minute;An unusually bright light moved across the sky and disappeared about 30 degrees off the horizon. I was standing in the back yard of my house testing-out a new green laser pointer, pointing it at the stars to observe the beam in the air.  I had been doing this for a couple of minutes when i was startled to see a very bright object moving overhead.  It seemed to be moving quite quickly towards the spot in the sky where I had pulsed the laser a few seconds earlier.  Thinking that it was a plane, I was worried that I might have distracted the pilot, as I am always careful to avoid pointing my laser at aircraft.  As I continued to observe the light as it moved from overhead towards the northeast, I became puzzled because the light did not look like a regular plane or helicopter.  It was much brighter than any star in the sky.  It was slightly yellow, about the same color as the sun at midday.  It made no sound.  Its motion reminded me of that of a satellite, with no obvious changes in direction or speed relative to the stars.  I watched it for about a minute until it was about 30 degrees above the northeast horizon, at which point the light disappeared.  The light appeared to go from full brightness to dark in under 2 seconds, and had the appearance of flattening out from top to bottom just before I could no longer see it.  I interpreted this as the kind of behavior one would expect from a satellite moving into the earth's shadow.  This was *much* brighter than any artificial satellite I have ever seen.;40.9509;-90.3658
Earlier report was found to be ISS.;2008-09-21 19:59:00;1 min;Earlier report was found to be ISS. I submitted a report earlier this evening, and after a bit of searching, I have determined that what I saw was the international space station.  The orbit track coincides very closely with my description.  Sorry for the false alarm. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.
