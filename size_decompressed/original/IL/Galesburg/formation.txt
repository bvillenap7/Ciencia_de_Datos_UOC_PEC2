A little before sunrise, I stepped on to my front porch to look at the twilight sky.  Looking south, I saw what at first appeared to be a very reflective airplane about 30 degrees above the horizon tracking smoothly across the sky  from south-southeast towards the northwest.  After a few seconds, I realized that I was not seeing an airplane-- at least not one like I have ever seen before.  It looked like a cluster of several very bright lights arranged in a tight formation, scintillating.  I became quite excited and ran inside to get my camera.  When I came out the formation had moved overhead and further along its smooth northwesterly trajectory.  I took video of the object as it passed by and receded.  I videoed for about two minutes.  The cluster is visible in the video, but the details of the formation are too small to be clearly discerned.   The formation was composed of two or three very bright lights along with a few smaller and dimmer lights in-between.  The cluster at first looked diamond- or cross-shaped, but after passing overhead it took on a more triangular appearance.  There was no noise.  The object did not leave a trail.  The whole event lasted about 3 or 4 minutes.;40.9509;-90.3658
