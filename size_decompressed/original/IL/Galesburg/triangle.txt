Triangular object with dim lights traveling quietly north to south at unusal speed and course.;2001-12-19 21:45:00;15 sec;Triangular object with dim lights traveling quietly north to south at unusal speed and course. Star gazing at the beautiful clear sky whey an object caught my eye moving from north to south (approx. 90 degrees). A dark triangular shaped object with dim lights (redish) on outside edges.  Unsure exactly how many lights, it looked to be fairly high in the sky, perhaps 4-5 lights on front two sides and little or none on back part.  I watched it quietly speed across the sky, pause at one point, briefly moved erratically, then continue south. ((NUFORC Note:  Please see other reports from this date.  PD));40.9509;-90.3658
