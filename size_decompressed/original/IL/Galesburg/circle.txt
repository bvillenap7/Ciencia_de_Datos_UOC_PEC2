silver, circular object moving at great speed with no apparent rising or setting on a horizon;2002-11-02 14:00:00;5 minutes;silver, circular object moving at great speed with no apparent rising or setting on a horizon Saw it as a silver, circular shape moving at great speed, at high altitude in a straight path from Northwest to Southeast.  I was able to see both horizons and the object did not rise or set from either direction.  It seemed to appear then disappear at great speed across the sky over a 5 minute period without sound, trail or lights.

About 10 white dots flying at the same speed overhead, in a triangular formation.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-05-03 21:23:00;About 5 minutes;About 10 white dots flying at the same speed overhead, in a triangular formation. It started with someone seeing it out in my front yard, and then notifying me to come look.  When I went outside, there was about 10 flying objects in the shape of a circle with no flashing lights, and a white light in the middle.  Most of them were flying north-east, but I spotted one heading south-east.  They were all flying at the exact same speed and appeared out of no where.  Three were flying in a triangle like formation, while others were following behind the formation.  They had no sound. It was sort of cloudy, but they were able to be seen with no squinting of the eye.;40.9509;-90.3658
