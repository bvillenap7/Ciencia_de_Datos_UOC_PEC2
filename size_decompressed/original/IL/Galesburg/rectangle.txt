Dark rectangle with 2 faint amber lights in front moving south to north at extremely high rate of speed.  Took about 4 seconds to cover 2/3 of visible sky.  Silent and unknown altitude but best guess is a very high altitude.  Structure would have been very large for a high altitude. Sky was clear and moonless.  Much faster than anything I have ever seen before.;40.9509;-90.3658
