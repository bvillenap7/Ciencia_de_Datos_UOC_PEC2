I was driving on I-80 going home and I noticed a light in the sky that was white on the inside and blue/green surrounding it.  I am watching it fly across the interstate and then the light suddenly turns off and I don’t see it again. I thought it might have been a shooting star at first but moving way to slow and close for that.  Then maybe a helicopter with a bright light on it but it seemed like it was moving too fast and I’ve seen a helicopter at night and it wasn’t as bright as this. I don’t get involved with this UFO stuff because I’m not really into it but this was freaky and I had to research it more and I came across this website and figured I should report it.  It wasn’t normal and I’m trying to rationalize it but I’m having trouble doing it.  There is a national guard stationed near Seneca, so it may have been a helicopter but the way the light looked just doesn’t add up.;41.3164;-88.5994
