My husband and I saw a round, orange object travel in a straight southerly direction then it got smaller and disappeared.;2015-07-31 21:00:00;3-4 minutes;My husband and I saw a round, orange object travel in a straight southerly direction then it got smaller and disappeared, I am a teacher of 14 years and my husband is a police officer of 21 years.  On July 31, 2015 at approximately 9:00 p.m. (21:00), I looked out of my living room window and noticed a round orange light.  It wasnâ€™t perfectly round and had a little nub coming off the left side.   The object was travelling in a straight direction heading south.   I tried to get a better look, but it was difficult to see it because my backyard trees were in the way.  I was sidetracked briefly by one of my children, then mentioned the object to my husband who went out on the deck to look at it.   I then grabbed some binoculars to get a closer look.  The object did not blink, but had a steady orange color.  When I had joined my husband, the object looked smaller.   A typical passenger jet airliner happened to be passing by in view at the same time so I could clearly tell the object was not an airplane.   The airplane was travelling in an east, southeasterly direction.  The object was farther up in the sky than the airplane.  The object then passed by the moon and looked smaller.  It then suddenly disappeared.   I would also like to mention this was a night we had a blue moon.;42.3122;-88.4418
