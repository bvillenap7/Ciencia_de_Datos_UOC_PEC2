I was out walking my dog when I noticed a tail of fire shooting across the sky.  I first thougth it was fireworks but traveled way to far.  I then notice 5 - 7 masses in the streek.  Traveling in a straight row, behind each other.  I waited for an explosion, thinking it migth be a plane going down.;42.3122;-88.4418
