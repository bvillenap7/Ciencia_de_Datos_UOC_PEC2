A few seconds latr it came back and lit up the entire area. My cousin Chris and I are each 14 years of age.  Lastnight we dissided to sleep outside.  The clouds were out so we really couldnt see the stars .  We were talking about something and I saw a large and bright haze in the corner of my eye.  I looked up and saw a bright greenish object in the sky. I immediatly yelled to my cousin to look up in the sky.  He then saw it and freeked out.  He got up and started to run towards the house.  I was amazed and still was looking at it.  It then shot away and left a green-yellow glow behind.  After i saw it leave i got up and saw it reapper.  Their is a barn close to us and the house and it lit up.  Their were no cars around and this is in a pretty secluded area.  My Cous then screamed.  He said the light was directly on top of him but i was too busy getting my shoes on.  As I was running towards the house all of a sudden it became pitch black and nothing was in the sky.  We remember it being pretty light ouside we could see each other fi! ne and didnt think anything of it.  About 25 minutes before it happened we were setting up a tarp to set our sleeping bags on.  I brought a super high powered flashlight that is used for my fathers boat.  My cousin was flashing it in the sky pointing out different stars that we could see through the clouds.  This might have attracted them who knows.  Throught the whole thing I was amazed at it and perfectly calm.  Next week we are going to sleep out again w/ cameras and if any thing happens i will write back.;42.3122;-88.4418
