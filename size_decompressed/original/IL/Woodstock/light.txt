The light went up directly from the ground, and stopped in the middle of the sky.  At first, I thought the light was fireworks, but it did not display any of the characteristics of any fireworks that I have ever seen.  It was an almost straight line (it curved in the middle like there was a hole in it) with red on the outside and yellow on the inside.  It happened again in the exact same area about 5 seconds later, except at this time something seemed to be sucking the light up.  I know of people who live in this area, who claim they have seen aurora borealis.  This does not seem to be related, as it was very early in the year plus did not exibit any of the signs of the aurora lights.
