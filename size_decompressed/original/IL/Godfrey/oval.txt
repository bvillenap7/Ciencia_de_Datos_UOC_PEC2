We saw a craft about the height that planes fly (30,000 ft?). It was white or silver and kinda shaped like a hamburger. It was just cruising along, then it kinda hovered (when we saw it and started pointing at it saying what is that?). It made kind of a looping u-turn, then it made a big left hand turn, and started accelerating. Then it accelerated so fast it disapeared from sight in about 3-5 seconds. It was unbeleivable! It was like Star Trek or something the way it disapeared. There was no sound or anything. At first we thought it might be a satelite until it turned.;38.9458;-90.2048999999999
