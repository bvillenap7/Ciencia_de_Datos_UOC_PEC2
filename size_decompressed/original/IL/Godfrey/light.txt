The first night, an orange light stayed in one spot for almost an hour. It was moving in little circles. Finally, it took off. To my friend (who wears glasses and has rather poor eyesite) it looked to be in the distant sky. To me (with very good vision) it looked like it was much closer than a star, like maybe a mile or so back in the woods, over the trees, but still small. Of course, it's hard to tell. The second night there were two of them. These did look far away. One in the west, and one in the north sky. Again, these were moving back and forth and in little circles. I would like to know if there is an atmospheric condition that might cause the illusion of movement like this. The only thing is, none of the other stars were moving, regardless of their brightness or position. ((NUFORC Note  We observe that the description is not inconsistent with a celestial body, a star or a planet.  If they were looking to the northwest, the object would not be Mars.

Bright lite moving west to east then reversing course instantly lasted 5 to 7 seconds;2006-09-08 20:20:00;5 to 7 sec.;Bright lite moving west to east then reversing course instantly lasted 5 to 7 seconds While sitting on our back patio this evening,I was focused on a star shinning between the trees in our back yard. All at once this very bright light appeared,brighter than the star behind it,it moved right to left an then moved left to right an disappeared. I was facing south at the time, and we are about 20 miles north of St.Louis,Mo. We have airplanes flying over alot from Lambert airport,but this was no airplane that I have ever observed before. The distance covered was  about 8 inches at your outstreched hand in 5 to 7 Seconds.  No sound was heard.;38.9458;-90.2048999999999
