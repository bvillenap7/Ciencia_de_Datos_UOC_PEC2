It faces east with an excellent view of downtown Chicago, through the floor to ceiling glass sliding doors.  While sitting on my couch, I witnessed a single very bright white light swoop down from west to east,disappearing in the eastern sky.  It took about 2 seconds.  Coincidentally (or not), I had just finished watching Close Encounters of the Third Kind.;41.8734;-87.8107

There were clouds in the eastern sky, and I lost sight after it entered the clouds.   I sky watch all the time from my balcony, and am familiar with, and often see, planes and helicopters.  This was neither.  Also, it attracted my sight because I have never seen a conventional aircraft flying in that pattern.;41.8734;-87.8107

We spotted a light that silently hovered and started to slowly move from North to South.  It changed positions numerous times and would fade and re-appear throughout the incident. It was flashing rapidly numerous colors, white, red and green.  At times, planes would fly next to it or below it.  If I had to guess it was about 800-900 ft. in the air and increased its elevation throughout the course of the sighting.;41.8734;-87.8107

Through binoculars I noted no other lights. Not an airplane. No other air traffic due to Covid. Light stopped and moved East and into cloud cover. Saw again momentarily in the cloud break.
