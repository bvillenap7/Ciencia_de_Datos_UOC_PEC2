Throbbing chevron pulsating lights craft;2002-10-09 02:38:00;3 minutes;Throbbing chevron pulsating lights craft Coming home from my bowling night at 2:38 a.m., I noticed an unusual shadowy effect upon the house next to ours. Some how the craft had the ability to generate a strong magnetic field as the electronic devices in my vehicle were acting mysteriously as I stood and stared with disbelief the craft revealed itself in its full glory.  It must have been hovering at least 250 – 400 feet above it totally obscured a huge cloud and had to be at least the size of an aircraft carrier.  It had multiple rows of lights (I would estimate 12-15 rows). The lights ranged in colors from a pale yellow all the way up to a deep dark purple.  The lights pulsed in a unique symmetrical way, yet some how it seemed to follow some sort of code.  Somehow I felt as though it was communicating with my inner soul, I was not afraid yet I felt at peace with the universe.  I had been trying to re-establish contact with the beings but somehow feel that my neighbour’s loud music is interfering with my cosmic karma.  The alien aircraft had an unusual disproportionate wedge shape when it originally uncloaked and after about 10-12 seconds, additional micro-pods began appearing as though attached to its starboard and aft sides.  I discovered the following day that I was photo-sensitive and had minor vomiting spells. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness describes self as being experienced with electronic circuits.  PD));41.8734;-87.8107
