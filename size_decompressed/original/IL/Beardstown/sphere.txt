Yellow-orange sphere with a long green tail.;2006-04-01 19:45:00;15 seconds;Yellow-orange sphere with a long green tail. One glowing yellow-orange sphere with a long green tail, moving northeast-to-east in a slight descending arc.  The tail got shorter in three distinct movements, and then the whole thing disappeared.  The sky was clear and the object was too high up in the sky to have been hidden by any trees.  At first I thought it was a meteor, but the angle of the arc was too slight for it to have crashed down at the time it vanished.  I have been unable to find any report of meteors in the area that night, and it was too big not to have been noted.  (Due to the distance/altitude, I'm not sure what the size of it was, but I'd compare it to holding a penny up at arm's length.);40.0033;-90.4252999999999
