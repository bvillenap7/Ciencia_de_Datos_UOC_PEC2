The first light slowly    dimmed out, and then a second gold light just higher than the first lit up.  Then it slowly dimmed out.  after four or five minutes, I seen 4 more lights in the northwest part of the sky lighting up and then slowly dimming out, at one  point all four were lit up at the same time.  After maybe 15min, i seen 4 more lights in the northeast region of the sky, doing the same. objects were circular in shape with a gold or bright yellow  color.  The lights were all lined up in a row. I could'nt see any movement, only that they would slowly dim to nothing.   I never seen them in the ne or nw region of the sky at the same time.  The lights were lined up fairly close together, to close to be a plane.
