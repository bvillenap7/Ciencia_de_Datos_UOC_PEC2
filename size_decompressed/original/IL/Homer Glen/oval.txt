Traveling from the northeast, these objects were red and orange, rather small, one right after the other, but not directly behind each other.  I saw one hover over head.  But no noise whatsoever.   Then, when they reached a certain point, they went upward and disappeared quickly.;41.6017;-87.9557

Was on deck reading. Husband was reclining in chair watching dragonflies darting back and forth above him.  Called me over to look at something he spotted in the sky.  Looked up and way above the clouds spotted an odd oval grayish something in the sky.  Way too high for any type of bird, or drone.  No movement, just sat there. Off to the east was a jet heading west (with a jet stream behind it).  Object was higher than jet.  As jet came closer to being below object, it shot off extremely fast to the west.  Still in our view, it stopped, sat a moment then shot off again to the south.  We always look for a logical explanation, but couldn't explain this.;41.6017;-87.9557
