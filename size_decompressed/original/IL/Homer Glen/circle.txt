We were watching TV on the third floor of our house, then out of the window my mother asked if the lights she saw were fireworks. I got up and looked out as well. The aircraft was stationary and even moved straight down at one point, thus why she thought it was a firework. Then, it continued on slowly moving forward. Every once in awhile it would come to a stop. There were 3 lights visible, 2 yellow and 1 red between them. After observing it for a couple minutes, it went out of sight be hind a tree that obstructed our view. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
