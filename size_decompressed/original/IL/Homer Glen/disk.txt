I was traveling in my car North on Bell road in Homer Glen, Il on 7/7/07.  At 9:40pm I saw an egg shaped amber glowing object cross the sky in front of my vehicle moving towards the east.  I pulled off the side of the road into a the Equestrian Estates subdivision and looked at this most unusual object as it progressed east thru the sky.   I looked back towards the west and observed many more of these objects coming towards me and passing overhead.   It was a very clear night with no clouds in the sky.  I was astonished at what I was seeing...as many as 30 to 40 of these objects were coming towards me and moving eastward at a very good rate of speed.   I turned my car engine off to listen....no sound whatsoever was coming from these objects.  Most of the objects were eggshaped and a bright amber in color, and gyrating in motion as they moved along, however, several were oval and laser-red in color as they flew over my head and other ones were brilliant neon blue oval in shape.  After about 10 minutes of watching these objects progress over my head and towards the east, I saw a straight line of ten of them moving thru the sky in the same direction.  Totally astonished.  Is there anybody out there that saw this event in the Southwest suburbs of Chicago at 9:45pm on Saturday, July 7th.;41.6017;-87.9557
