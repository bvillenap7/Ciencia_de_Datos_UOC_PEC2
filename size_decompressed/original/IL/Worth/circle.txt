I have seen planes land near a home I used to live in so I know it was close enough to land but it was moving so fast and it looked as if it was leaving not coming down.  I only saw it for a second. It was twice as big as the north star.  I looked at one of my neighbors who was smoking a cigar outside and asked if he saw it and said yes and so did a neighbor walking his dog, said the bark had its tail behind its legs and wimping. I have seen a meteor and that was not one.  The strange thing was, there was no sound and it was close enough to make a sound....blue ish white like those new style headlights some high end vehicles have.  South bound.  Bigger than a star.  Must have traveled about a 35 degree angle on the sky.  Don't know my distances sorry.  Oh and no sound.;41.689;-87.7803
