Bright light in sky changing coulours and erratic flight patterns.;2012-03-19 23:00:00;20 mins;Bright light in sky changing coulours and erratic flight patterns. This is the fourth time my girlfrien and I have seen this very bright circular object. Almost looks like a very bright star or planet but makes erratic flight patterns.  It's always almost in the same spot in the sky, and it changes colors from blue to red to green to yellow etc. It moves short distances very fast and in awkward patterns.  The first time we've seen it it was changing shapes.  She was never into this sort of thing but I had my first sighting living in Canada four years ago and have been intrigued ever since.  There was no way it was a plane, helicopter, or flares but could be some logical scientific explanation, any advice is appreciated.;41.689;-87.7803
