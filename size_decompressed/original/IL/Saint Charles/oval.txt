Orange sphere seen.;2018-09-14 21:45:00;2 minutes;Orange sphere seen. AT 9:45 p.m., I was out in my yard with my 2 dogs.  I live in a wooded area on the top of a valley.  At first I saw an orange light through the trees.  I didn’t think much about it until it broke the tree line.  Roughly 250 ft in the air and traveling around 75 mph, a large orange sphere appeared.  It had appeared almost liquid in appearance, luminance.  It was large.  Around the size of a huge SUV.  And silent.  It had passed directly overhead.  I could see a smaller dark orange circle moving around inside the larger orange circle. It traveled about ½ mile further and just blinked out. The sky was crystal clear with no wind.  No reaction from my dogs.  And I was oddly calm for seeing my first U.F.O.  I did get a feeling that it was not mechanical… but rather alive in a sense.  Imagine the feeling you may get watching whales swim on a nature program.;41.9291554455445;-88.3406247524753
