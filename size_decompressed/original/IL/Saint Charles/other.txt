Horizontal twinkling lights transforming into triangle follwed by all lights going in opposite directions.;2013-11-10 17:50:00;90 seconds;Horizontal twinkling lights transforming into triangle follwed by all lights going in opposite directions. I was traveling east on Route 64 towards Randall Rd. in St. Charles.  I saw 5 sets of lights in a horizontal pattern.  The lights were blue and red and were twinkling.  I thought it might be a blimp returning to the DuPage airport.It was moving slowly.  As I drove closer, the horizonal formation mechanically tranformed into a triangle.  When I looked again all lights that composed the angles of the triangle were moving off in seperate directions.  All that remained were multiple single lights in the sky.  The initial pattern is below.  . . . . . . . .;41.9291554455445;-88.3406247524753
