It moved to the right a little to prove it was there and hovered for 20 minute or more until military/satellite really fast jets come near it, it went down into the woods and dissappeared. I have a trippy small picture of it and the fast planes circles 200 times around the area for 3-4 hours. The air moved like water and everything tripped out when the thing was around, it felt like I was on LSD. Im Chris Blaha and 2 weeks earlier I asked Jesus that i never saw a UFO before, I actually think mary or jesus was on that ship, It was the wierdest but most comfrating thing ever.i dont have a computer hookup for the pictures i got off my cell phone   It happened 8- 9 pm 7-12-07 ((NUFORC Note:  Star or planet?
