I was in my hot tub only 10 sec looking up at the clear star lite night when a large triangular object flew over my head. It appeared very low very large. It looked like an arrowhead with a concave back. It was a dark smooth somewhat curved body. It had a thin body like an arrowhead. The perimeter of the craft had little white lights around the object. It was traveling east to west very fast, NO SOUND. If the perimeter was not lit up you would not have seen it. I saw it for only 4 seconds, but I know what I saw.;41.9291554455445;-88.3406247524753
