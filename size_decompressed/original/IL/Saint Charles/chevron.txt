Eas;1995-09-09 00:30:00;5-10 minutes;First appeared as a bright white light like an approaching airliner,seen from a vehicle traveling S.on Randall Rd. Moonlight night. Easy to see detail as an object,but not airliner,either moving very slowly or stationary at about 800-1000 ft.  We're both watching the object as we see side view to the East out of car's side window. Description: wing shaped (chevron),black, running lights on front edge of wing (red), larger than a single engine plane, smaller than jetliner. As I slowed the car down to pull over, the object appeared to be stationary (not moving forward) and did not make any sound at all. A friend later said that it must have been the stealth bomber here for the air show. My question is  why was it hovering over a residential neighborhood in St Charles at 12:30 at night. This description was noted in my diary the next morning in 1995.;41.9291554455445;-88.3406247524753

I noticed a chevron shaped object flying east. I figured it was a plane heading towards DuPage airport.  It was traveling pretty fast and then it just stopped moving and hovered.   I kept driving west and it just disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));41.9291554455445;-88.3406247524753
