I went out and observed this stationary red light in the western sky. i watched it for about 5 minutes, it very slowly flashed but did not move. Then it shot straight up into the heavy cloud cover and was gone. Then on Oct 5th I was out on my back deck.. about 11pm, I noticed again a red light I called for both my daughter and her friend to come out and see it.  All three of us watched this light over the course of twenty minutes. At one point it dropped something out of it,  looked like sparks, this seemed to fall about a mile west of my house. The light was identical to the earlier observation. The red light very slowly flashed off and on for about twenty minutes. It very slowly scroosed the sky from west to east as we watched. I went in to the house to get a flashlight and blinked the flashlight off and on in a pattern, it seemed to respond the pattern back to us. Then it sharply went up.. till it was  barely seen, then came back down and traced off to the east, where we no longer could see it. We took a digital picture of the object, it is not very clear, but distinctly shows the object.;41.9291554455445;-88.3406247524753
Many orbs moving through the sky in a formation, flickering, moving at the same pace.;2013-07-13 22:21:00;2 minutes;Many orbs moving through the sky in a formation, flickering, moving at the same pace. As I was leaving my job (Juvenile Officer) I noticed many lights in the sky.   At first I thought it was the flash from fireworks.  However, I sped up and turned into an area where I could see the U.F.O.'s clearly.   The night sky was VERY clear and the object's disappeared very quickly, one, two, even three at a time until there were only 3 visible objects left.   There was slight blinking in and out, but the objects were far away from my vantage point.   The object's remained in the sky for only a minute or two until the last three remaining lights disappeared.;41.9291554455445;-88.3406247524753

I froze when I looked up.. I was outside taking garbage out.   Ran inside called a daughter to come out, she said grab your phone to get a picture, I ran back in called 3 daughters to come out.  Went outside, my kids were scared.  I then called my two neighbors outside.  This whole time there is no movement of these lights..  Then one by one they moved slightly, then separated and each one disappeared before reappearing more up in the sky.  They each went over my neighborhood and continued for at least 20 minutes.   I got binoculars and could see an oval shape with one red and one green light on each side.  Very bright light was still stronger than the colored ones.  I watched them hover for over 20 minutes.. Some went to the northeast and the others to the south east.  Can't make any sense of it.  Kinda freaking out .. I just! looked out again and I can still see 5..  4 are circling and one to the south east is back to the very white ball not moving at all ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
