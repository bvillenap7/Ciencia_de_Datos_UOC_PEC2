To answer some of your questions  I live in St Charles, Illinois and I was in my driveway looking at the up at the night sky when I saw the 3 objects.  I as you imagine, I was taken back from what I saw.  I have never seen anything like that before.  Yes I too, have seen many shooting stars, heat lighting and the Northern Light.  But this was totally different. I would have to guess that what I saw lasted for only a few seconds.  Like I said, they were traveling in a westerly direction, straight and unvarying.  The color bold truculent white, and I wondered why there was neither sound nor back trail.  I hope this answers a few of your questions and if I can be of additional assistance, please don't hesitate to ask. ((name and e-address deleted));41.9291554455445;-88.3406247524753
Red Star like light moving NW to SE;2010-09-11 10:23:00;2:20;Red Star like light moving NW to SE It was 09-11-2010 at about (08:20pm CST) and I was having a smoke with my girlfriend and as we outside I like always stargaze and observe the skies. I fixed my eyes on a red star, wasn't a plane because I see them often at night and they flash and usualy eazy to identify, anyhow I was gazing at this red star and kept observing the rest of the stars in the sky.  It looked just like the rest it was stainionary but it was red, so as I admire the red star, I turned to my GF and said to her, wow look at that red star, she turned and said thats no star its moving moving? I though, holly @5*! it is, so I dashed and grab my video camera and got about 2 minutes of video following the object from its path NW to SE until I lost it over some trees and horizon.  On 09-13-2010 I was taking out the trash at about (7:41pm CST)and looked toward the sky where I seen sighting 1 and to behold it was up there again. I snapped a picture of it without really trying to since my intent was recording it, which I did managed. This again was like a few minutes sighting no more that 3 minutes. I lost view of it somewhere SE.  The object/objects if it was the same one or not, didn't make any noise.;41.9291554455445;-88.3406247524753

My friend was with me and said what is that? I looked up and saw a very bright white light with no blinking lights. It seemed to be about the same distance as a satellite. It was moving very fast south to north, It was moving on a straight line with no sound but then it came to a complete stop directly above.  It stayed there for about 5 seconds and shot straight away into space getting smaller until it vanished.  Then to my surprise 15 or 20 minutes later we saw the same thing happen again but with this time it stopped overhead for only 3 seconds but then again shot into space at an amazing speed.  It was like watching something take off in Star Wars light speed. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

14-15 Red lights over Kane County near St. Charles, Illinos.;2012-10-06 22:10:00;20 minutes;14-15 Red lights over Kane County near St. Charles, Illinos. I saw about 7-8 red lights in the sky when driving north by Orchard rd and Rte 30.  They had no line or order like some constellation and were stationery and appeared to be abot 15-20k ft up.  Then when I came to a point with full view I saw another 7 lights in a line, not moving very much. They were lined up traveling south in a traffic path used for jets going to O'hare that rhe jets usually vere east over St. Charles Il.   The planes in line were closer the commercial jets would ever be and even though they looked to be in the O'hare flight path they looked higher then inbound jets would be.  Bright red lights, no blue or green.  Almost through they were helicopters, but there were no flashing lights.  All I could think is that they were military aircraft gaurding Obama while he is campaigning.  Really strong show of force whatever it was.;41.9291554455445;-88.3406247524753
Saw a series of lights changing colors in the SE sky.;2014-09-24 01:00:00;45 minutes;Saw a series of lights changing colors in the SE sky. Was outside on the phone with a friend of mine and noticed a light rapidly changing color from white/red/blue moving slowly above the tree line to the SE of my back porch.  Observed it for a while, and it didn't move as quickly as a plane would have been moving in any direction.  Observed a second light slightly north of the other light, with the same color changes.   At one point both became very bright for a few seconds, then changed color shifts from the white/red/blue to one light only going white/red and the other going white/blue.   Then observed a third light above the two, about halfway between them doing the full white/red/blue color change.  Friend on the phone went outside where he lived and was able to observe on light following the white/blue color change.;41.9291554455445;-88.3406247524753
