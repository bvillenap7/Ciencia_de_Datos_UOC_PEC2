I saw a crescent moon over Meijer grocery store, as I was exiting a Starbucks on the opposite side of the same parking lot.  I gave my daughter, who was in my car her beverage and closed her door.  She was facing Starbucks.  I took a photo of the moon over Meijer grocery store and part of my car and Meijer are in one photo.  I took a second photo of the moon and I did notice lights in the sky flying, but I did not look too closely.  I assumed that they were planes.  I got in the car with my beverage and I drove home.  Later, I reviewed my dayâ€™s photos and was stunned to see blue rectangular shapes in the sky over Meijer coming towards me.  Two blue ufos, each one had two blue glowing rectangles.  I do not think they are planes any more.  Sorry to say my daughter was not facing Meijer and did not see what I did.  So I can show you photos.  However, I am not interested in any publicity and prefer to remain anonymous to the public.  Just letting you know what I! saw.;41.9291554455445;-88.3406247524753
