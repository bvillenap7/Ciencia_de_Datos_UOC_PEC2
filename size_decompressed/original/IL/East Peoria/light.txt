Bright white light turns out to be 3 lights in triangle formation.  ((anonymous report));2018-04-29 20:39:00;15 minutes;Bright White Light turns out to be 3 lights in triangle formation. I was at a restaurant in East Peoria by the riverfront.  I had just finished eating and was walking back to my car.  It was clear night decided to snap some photos of the stars. I noticed a very bright star and snapped photos.  My phone didn't store the original ones so snapped away again.  I snapped photos of the stars by the electrical tower by the restaurant and of the bright light saw over the gas station next to the restaurant. I showed the photos to a friend and they said look at your photos again.  There was not just one light but 3 in a triangle formation and the lights were moving.  Later after friend zoomed in on the 3 lights together found out it was a solid object. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Bright White Light seen at East Peoria Festival Park.  ((anonymous report));2018-08-11 20:05:00;2-3 minutes;Bright White Light seen at East Peoria Festival Park I was in the East Peoria Festival Park.   I wasn't the only one there, but I doubt anyone noticed it.  I was on the opposite end.    I was sitting down on a park bench and looked up to admire the river front and there it was maybe half way in between East Peoria and Peoria.   This happened in broad daylight.  I tried to get my smart phone ready to record but by the time zeroed in on it.  It was gone.   It made no sound whatsoever. FYI,  I had trouble with your site previously.  I tried to log the Cylinder Incident on 07/20/18 and had to re-enter it.  I didn't know it got stored twice.   It was not a hoax and neither is this.
