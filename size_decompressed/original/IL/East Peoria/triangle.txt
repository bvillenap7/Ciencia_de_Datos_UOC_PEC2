Partially Cloaked Triangle and Bright White Light Intercept over the Riverfront.  ((anonymous report));2018-08-24 19:55:00;5 minutes;Partially Cloaked Triangle and Bright White Light Intercept over the Riverfront I was walking towards the entrance of the park.  I was just snapping away photos.  It was still light out but getting darker.  I took a total of 12 photos.  I posted to my facebook page.   One of my friends commented on one of the photos what is that.  I reviewed all twelve photos and found to odd things on two separate photos.  One had a triangle partially obscured but definitely three sided flying overhead away from me on the opposite side of the riverfront.  In another photo maybe taken seconds after that a bright white light flying above on my side of the riverfront over the bridge.  In other words both objects converging but on opposite sides of the river.    I listed myself as the only witness because I was the only one who witnessed this.  No one else looked up.  I didn't witness it I only found out after what my friend had mentioned.   Both made no sound whatsoever.
