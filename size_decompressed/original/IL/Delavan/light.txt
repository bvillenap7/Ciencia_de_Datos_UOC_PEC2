My girlfriend and I were driving south on Towerline Rd., driving from Pekin, on the way to Delavan, IL.  When we were approaching the Tobaggan Rd./Towerline Rd. intersection, we both seen a light in the sky that must have been quite a few miles away, it resembled a star because of the distance, but something tells me it was an airplane or some type of object. We seen this object fall very quickly, it didn’t fall in the blink of an eye, however it fell gradually but quick.  This object was south east of Towerline Rd. The strangest part of this is that after we seen the object falling all of sudden it disappeared without any big light (sign of explosion) or trace- it didn’t fade away whatsoever, it just completely disappeared. The object looked as if it was crashing to the Earth, it was falling at around a 45 degree angle, and must have been traveling 200 mph or faster- from the speed I seen it falling as far away as we were. My girlfriend witnessed this first, then I seen it as soon as I looked in the sky ahead of us while we were driving. If I were to guess, I would guess that the object had to be at least 20 miles or so south of Towerline Rd/Tobaggan Rd. intersection, and at least 5 miles east. Of course, it could have been as far as 100 miles however for some reason I had the idea that it was closer- it just didn’t appear to be a star even though all we seen was one white light. We seen this object falling for around 10 seconds before it dissapeared out of thin air. This object didn't leave a trail of light.
