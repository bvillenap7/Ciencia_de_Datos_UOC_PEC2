Bright white light moving in a weird pattern.;2016-07-25 21:26:00;10 minutes;Bright white light moving in a weird pattern. I was smoking a cigarette and I can see plans around area.  I see a round bright light moving right to left pretty far away then it turned was coming closer.   Not close enough to make a clear judgement what it was and then went backwards and back to moving left.  It was moving key fat also.  Very of how it moved which is why I took notice.   I came in because I was getting ate up by mosquitos.   Very odd though.;41.7651;-89.6859
