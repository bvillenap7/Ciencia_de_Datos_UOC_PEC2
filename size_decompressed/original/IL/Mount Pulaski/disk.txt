Bright, hovering disk over Mt. Pulaski, Illinois;2008-08-20 01:30:00;1 hour plus;Bright, hovering disk over Mt. Pulaski, Illinois Aug 20. 2008  The time was 1:30 am. We were at a house in the country, about 4-5 miles from Mt. Pulaski. We were outside getting in the car when we noticed a very bright light in the sky over the Mt. Pulaski area.  It was brighter than a star and the light dimmed and got brighter repeatedly.  It was round or disk shaped and appeared to be rotating.  The craft would also zig-zag back and forth.  It did not have any blinking lights like a plane has and at times seemed to just hover.  I am a 23 year old female who lives at home and takes dental classes.  My friend is a C.N.A. who works in a nursing home.  She is 26.  We have never seen anything like this before.;40.003;-89.2906
