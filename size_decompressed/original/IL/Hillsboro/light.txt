MISSOURI INVESTIGATORS GROUP Report:  Bright flashing lights in a circ. pattern, 34-50 yards in dia. hovering about 4 stories up.;2002-10-05 00:30:00;5 minutes;On my way south on Highway 55 from Hillsborogh Ill. I saw a configuration of bright flashing lights in a circular pattern about 34 to 50 yards in diameter hovering about 4 stories above the ground.Imediatly before seeing these lights i saw a bright ball of light above and in front over the highway. It seemed to fall a little way and then burn out like very large flare. Then Ilooked to my right and saw what at first resembled fireworks. Bright white, rapidly flashing lights. First I realized the the lights were not falling and burning out like fireworks. As my line of sight changed do to the road curving I could see that the light were aranged in a very big circular patternand were hovering high above the ground in one place. They never moved and eventaully they were obscured by the landscape. There were a lot of cars on the road and I know Im not the only person who saw it. I would very much like to know what it could be.
