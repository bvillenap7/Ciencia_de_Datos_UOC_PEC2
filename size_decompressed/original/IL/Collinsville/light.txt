Sphere of light from Collinsville to Granite City;1988-10-30 22:00:00;20 Minutes;Sphere of light from Collinsville to Granite City Driving my pregnant wife to St. Elizabeth's hospital in Granite City from Troy.  When we hit I-270, we noticed a sphere of light in the sky that seemed to be following (or leading) us all the way to the hospital, from 270, down 203, etc.  The object seemed to zoom in and out of the clouds and disappear repeatedly, it appeared two dimensional.

It was accompained by a crackling of burning sound. We were watching a fireworks display in our town when an extremely bright blue light streaked across the sky.  It was hard to make out any definate shape due to its speed but it travelled with a tail behind it in a east- west direction.  The observers in my immediate party were between the ages of 14-48.  They have professions including study, homemaking, and education.;38.6831000000001;-89.9842000000003

Bright orange glowing sphere traveling from southwest to northeast into a thunderstorm.  Object made no audible sounds and did not blink.  Steady orange glow that seemed to have a halo around it. It seemed to travel about the same speed or faster than a rotor craft.  Contacted the local FD and Anderson Hospital, no knowledge of incoming emergency helicopters.  It flew directly into thunderstorm. Object appeared to be about 2 to 3000 ft above.  Object flew in straight line directly over town, blinked 3 or 4 times and vanished. Speed of object was consistent. We live close to Scott Air Force Base. I am used to experiencing aircraft on a daily basis.  This object headed north of SAFB from the southwest (St. Louis). I've never seen an object so brilliantly orange, like a very large candle.  The brightness didn't change at all until it exited several miles from town. It made absolutely no sound.  Rather shocking. I have four photos of the object from my cellphone.;38.6831000000001;-89.9842000000003

I stopped dead in my tracks and had my friend verify what I was seeing.  Upon further inspection, we swa multiple lights in that region change from red, blue, and green for a brief moment.  There was also a moment where what appeared to be a purplish distortion that resembled a nebula around one of the lights.  They seemed to shoot around at incredible speed but always returned to their original position.  Obviously startled we looked online to see if anyone was seeing what we saw and all I could find were reports of Starlink sattelites but I am slow to accept this as an answer because of the randomness of the movements observed.  I plan on trying to find a telescope to observe better.;38.6831000000001;-89.9842000000003
