Rectangular shape over Collinsville.;2014-09-24 19:45:00;40 seconds;Rectangular shape over Collinsville Was driving north on 157 when I noticed a bright light which I first thought was a C-5 that normally fly over to Scott Air Force Base some 15 miles to our east.  As I got closer the light increased in intensity.  Due to the low altitude I figured it had to be a police helicopter so I slowed down.  As I drove under it it was banking to the east towards the tree line of the bluffs.  What I briefly saw in about 3 seconds was a rectangular shaped object moving slowly with no apparent sound.  The size was like holding a envelope at arm's length.  Would estimate height at less than 300 feet. It was huge!  When it banked, the bright lights I first saw faded, and I could make out some faint but sharp led type of lighting on the perimeters and within object. I turned around a sped south to see if I could spot it where the bluff are lower to east but had no luck.  It almost looked like a flying super modern penthouse if that doesnt sound crazy.  Not sure I saw all of it due to the lighting.  Someone else had to have seen it.   Incredible!!!;38.6831000000001;-89.9842000000003
