As we drove home at the same time in seperate cars, something caught my eye so I looked up in the sky and saw 3 white/grey objects seem to be separting from a larger object with maybe smoke around them perhaps.  They appeared to be glowing or burning hot some, the smoke or water vapor around them was lit up some.  When I pulled in the driveway I saw her outside looking up and she ran up to my car and told me she saw a huge fireball (yellow/white) in the sky fly over head, the biggest one she has ever seen, but did not see what happened later due to someone tailgating while pulling in.  She said fireball object was maybe slightly smaller than her hand at arms length.  It was in the Belleville News Democrat 09/30/00, they got responses from Scott Air Force Base (said they know nothing and that a good number of people have called them about this), the tracking center in CO (said no known objects), etc. Must have been a big rock from space coming in over our heads...;38.6831000000001;-89.9842000000003
