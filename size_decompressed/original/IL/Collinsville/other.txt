I recently purchased a pair of Celestron Skymaster 15x70 Binoculars.  I'm amazed how it cuts through light pollution.   While sitting on my swing and looking up at stars a T-Formation came into view. At first it looked solid but it had individual squarish looking objects in it.  There were no lights but they had a almost tan/luminescent color to them against the dark sky.   As I lowered my binoculars I still saw the T- formation as it went behind some trees I stood up but the horizon was blocked by more trees.  At first I thought these were geese but I've never seen birds fly in a T formation that huge and travel so quickly.  The flew like they knew where they were going.  Through the binoculars and without they were in a perfect formation and it did look like, possibly, they were part of a T.  It reminded me of those huge formations sighted in space.  I would put the size as a ruler put at arms length. Travelling fast like a T at eleven o'clock.  Much higher than passenger aircraft.  Possibly in space. A slight aura around the whole T-formation.;38.6831000000001;-89.9842000000003
