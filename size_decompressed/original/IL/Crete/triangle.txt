On Saturday September 4th approx. 11:40am I saw an object in the sky that was golden in color. It appered to be a triangle. The object was hovering in one place for a minute or so, then shot across the sky. It did'nt leave a trail, but there was a short golden streak that followed closely behind, I think it was because the object moved so quickly. This all happened in Crete, Illinois.;41.439;-87.6027
