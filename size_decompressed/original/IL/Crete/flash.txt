Stationary and repeated streaks of light in the sky.;2007-11-08 22:10:00;3 minutes;Stationary and repeated streaks of light in the sky. Me and wife saw repeated stationary flashes/streaks in the sky over a period of 3-4 minutes.  The streaks appeared in the sky in the same place for about 3 or 4 minutes.  The last three flashes got repeatedly duller and faded away.   I tried to discredit it to myself maybe beleiveing it was a plane, but these were not flashes consistent with that of a plane.  They were more like streaks a comet or meteor would leave.;41.439;-87.6027
