At 8:19 PM CST above the skies of Will County, Illinois, there was a radiating ball of red light tracking due east at a rate of movement far too slow to be a meteor, or satellite. After approximately 45 seconds to a minute of this tracking it made a sudden 90 degree turn due south, and became gradually dimmer. It tracked south for approximately 5 to 10 seconds and made another 90 degree turn due east and proceeded on this course for another 5 to 10 seconds. It made another 90 degree turn south and then another east, traveling in each direction for 5 to 10 seconds. It then disappeared spontaneously. The object left no contrail or smoke trail and made no noise. The object was not any perfect shape, but more resembled a radiating ball of fire. After itâ€™s apparition it became gradually dimmer until to point of disappearance.;41.439;-87.6027
