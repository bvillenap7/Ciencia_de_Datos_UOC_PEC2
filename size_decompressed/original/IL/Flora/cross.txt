Strange gray object spotted in my small town;2010-10-13 17:30:00;~1.5min;Strange gray object spotted in my small town I was heading home from work on Wednesday, October 13th, 2010, on what was earlier, a rainy day.  When the evening came around, the sky was beautifully clear and blue.  I was driving, 10 and 2, and looked over my left shoulder.  I was heading West bound.  I saw something in the sky and passed it off at first.  I took another look over and it was still there.  I continued to observe it for roughly a minute.  It was stationary and I was just WAITING for it to move.  Since it wasn't moving I figured I would get my cell phone out of my pocket and video it.  I turned my head toward the road to concentrate on driving, pulled out my cell phone, turned on the camera, and the object was gone.  It was shaped sort of like a cross.  The center was more of a thin oval.  There was a small protrusion on the top of the object and a protrusion on the bottom that was about twice as long as the one on top.  It was VERY low to the ground.  Probably about 200 yards from me, and 80! -100 feet in the air.  There is little to no air traffic in this small town.  We have a couple of bright yellow crop dusters, and they're hard to mistake. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));38.6664;-88.491
