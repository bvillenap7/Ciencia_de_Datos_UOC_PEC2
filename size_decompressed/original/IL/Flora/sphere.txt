I was standing in my backyard at 10 pm looking at the stars through the camera lens on my phone.  suddenly, i noticed a bright, red, round light appear out of the southeast. the light looked as though it was only a few hundred feet high and seemed about 1/4 a mile away.  i began recording it on my phone.  it moved quicker than i realized at the time, and within a few seconds it had made it’s way towards me and seemed to hover about 100 foot away and much lower.  it flew right above the rooftop of the church that is aprox. 5 yards from my backdoor.  it went behind a tree on it’s slow path and once it was observable again it had moved incredibly further away to the northeast. about 10 minutes later, i went back outside and the same scenario happened again for a 2nd and even 3rd time.  i was able to video all three occurrences.  i wasn’t sure what it was, the actual size, or the actual distance away from me at the time or even to this day.  i assumed it was a drone b! eing flown by a hobbyist in the neighborhood or law enforcement.  i told my dad about it today (a week and a half later) and showed him one of the videos and he encouraged me to share it.  he’s a respected military vet and is pretty confident also that we are not alone!!! :).  hope this helps the study!;38.6664;-88.491
