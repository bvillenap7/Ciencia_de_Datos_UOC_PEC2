4 fireballs moving together in a single line.;2013-11-28 20:00:00;5 minutes;4 fireballs moving together in a single line. At 8:00pm there was aline of 4 orange/red fireballs moving from the northwest to the southeast.  They stayed in a single file line and i followed them to the point that I had to go to the back of the house from the front.  I never did see them from the front.   It was cloudy but they were below the clouds.  Moving slowly, maybe with the speed of a heliocopter.  Slower than a plane.  Each of the fireballs seemed to move slightly back and forth with no regularity.  For the most part strait and steady.  No sound from them either.;42.338225;-88.2663684782609
