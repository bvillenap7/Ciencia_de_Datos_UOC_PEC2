The pictures just looked black after I took them so I never really looked at them closer.  I was clearing my camera tonight, and I started zooming into the black pictures and when I did, I found out that I actually did catch the lights I saw.  I am sending 4 pictures that just look black, but if you zoom in you can see on strange reddish, white lights.... I took the pictures on a Kodak EzShare Z760 Digital Camera, I was looking east when I took the pictures.  There was no noise and it seemed to move a little erratic.  I don't remember much else, because it was so long ago.  Thank you.;42.338225;-88.2663684782609
Ball of light moving to the east slow and silent around 2 miles high.;2008-05-21 22:30:00;2 Minutes;Ball of light moving to the east slow and silent around 2 miles high. My husband and I were out back looking at the sky, because it was such a clear beautiful night. My husband pointed out a satellite in the sky and just then I said oh my gosh look right above your head, when we looked up we saw a ball of bright light, lighter than anything we have ever seen in the sky.  I had the camera outside since my last sighting and I took pictures as it moved away from us to the east. It was probably around 2 miles up and it moved very slow and silent. I snapped 6 or 7 pictures which I am sending as well.  They did not turn out clear and look like lines in the sky. We used 800 speed film, no flash, on a Canon Rebel SLR 35 MM Camera. In picture one, if you blow it up you can actually see two separate lights and almost a shape, on picture two you can see a dark triangle shape. The light was very bright but did not give out light. It is very strange to explain.  We are both believe in life on other planets as we have had sightings in the past. I believe we know the difference between satellites, stars, planes, helicopters, and unknown objects. We work full time, have no kids, and lead a very normal life.  I reported a different sighting on April 16th so this is not my first time reporting. If someone wants to call us regarding this they are welcome too, but if you feel there is no need then it's ok too.;42.338225;-88.2663684782609
Pulses of steady white light, 10 seconds apart, 10-15 degrees covered in 1 minute.;2013-08-13 02:30:00;~1 minute;Pulses of steady white light, 10 seconds apart, 10-15 degrees covered in 1 minute. Light:  As I was looking toward Perseus for some comet debris action, I noticed a pulse of light near Capella. The pulses of white light continued steadily, occuring every 10 seconds. They weren't quick, like the flashes of light on any aircraft I've before seen.  They gradually gained luminance and dissipated at the same rate, spanning about one second.  After 6 pulses, I saw no more flashes.  The last two were not as bright as the first four. 	Movement:  The object moved in (presumably, because I could see nothing besides the light pulses) a straight path due East. It started at about level with Capella, just a few degrees to the left of it.  Its path went a few degrees under the star, and 5-10 degrees to the right and 3-5 degrees below it, the pulses faded. 		I heard no sound.  It seemed very, very far up...but I'll leave the speculation up to you.   Apologies for approximations in measurements.  I only have my hands to measure for the time being.   Thanks for your time!;42.338225;-88.2663684782609
