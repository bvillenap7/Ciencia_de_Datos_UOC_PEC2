light in sky chased away by two jets.;1998-06-15 23:00:00;00:04:00;light in sky chased away by two jets. i was sitting on my back porch looking at the stars on a very clear night and noticed that the big dipper looked different. after about one minute one of the big dippers stars did a sort of spiral in a direction moving away outwards from the earth. then about 10 or 15 seconds later, a very loud and fast moving jet past by coming from near west to east. as soon as it past by , another identical sounding jet came from near north to south....neither jets had any lights on whatsoever.it was like the star was avoiding the jets. the sky was very clear that night with no clouds.i have never heard that kind of jet before. it sounded more like a rocket or something. i never thought it would be a good idea to come forward with this but it seems that it could be of importance since there seems to be more and more sightings .also about 1 or 2 months later i saw something early after sunrise ( in daylight ) it is kind of hard to discribe.

Brilliant white light, moving from south to north over McHenry, IL.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of International Space Station.  PD));2012-04-12 20:05:00;2 minutess;Brilliant white light, moving from south to north over McHenry Illinois. Observed one slow moving bright white light. Object did not appear to be a fixed wing aircraft, but appeared to be at high altitude, though not high enough to be in orbit. The sun was setting to the west which may have illuminated the object. It was moving from south to north in straight balistic motion and did not deviate off its path. It made no sounds. ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of International Space Station.

The light was going through the light color spectrum..roygbiv..repeating these colors..  The object was traveling west to east but in a non-linear fashion.   What was truley strange the object would stop by a cloud then move on to the next cloud then stop again.  Then continue until out of site..moments later one more identical object appeared then did the same thing….  It looked like they were searching for something..   My opinion:  These were living creatures…;42.338225;-88.2663684782609
