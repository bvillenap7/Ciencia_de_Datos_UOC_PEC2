I noticed movement flying about in front of one cloud. They appeared to be birds.  But they were flying in and out of this cloud.  The sun was lighting up the left side of the cloud. The under side was gray.  These large birds were reflecting light once they would swoop away from the underside of the cloud into the sun light.  Then would fly back into the cloud and disappear.  Picture 5 or 6 birds swooping in circles in and out of a cloud.  I need to find out what the cloud elavation was this day.  I know it was about one mile away. and by guessing the elavation to be 3 or 4 thousand feet.  And by judging the birds size.I compared them to a jetliner at thirty five thousand feet.I did the math.  I have a degree in eloctronics.  These birds were between 20 and 25 feet in large.  What was strange was that they were moving too fast for the size.  The bigger an animal gets the more slow it moves.  These birds would swoop and turn on a dime and fly,soar like back into the cloud. It seemed to me they were living in this cloud.;42.338225;-88.2663684782609
