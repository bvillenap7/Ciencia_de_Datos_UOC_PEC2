Triangle shaped craft with bright white lights over Mchenry, IL at approx. 20:35.;2008-04-15 23:35:00;3-4 Minutes;Triangle shaped craft with bright white lights over Mchenry, IL at approx. 20:35. Last night, I walked outside my backdoor to have a cigarette before bed. It was very bright because the moon was out. I shut the door turned around bent over to light my cigarette up, when I looked up I noticed about 150 feet from me in the sky right above the horizon a triangle shaped craft. It looked like it had light bars on each of the sides and each of the three corners had very bright lights on it. It seemed to pulsate a bit and was completely silent. I stared at it for 15-20 seconds.  When I finally realized what I was seeing, I ran back inside to grab my phone to take a picture because my camera was on the second floor. I was gone for approximately 20 seconds, when I came back I noticed it was gone. I scanned the sky for it I looked farther into the distance and could see it had moved very far away and much higher. I tried to take a picture buy my phone camera could not pick the object up. I tried to move into the moonlight but it still did not help. The pictures on my phone just seem to be black skies.  I watched it for about another 2-3 minutes as it moved left and right and up and down. I then noticed another object (a plane I assume because I could see flashing lights on it) underneath the object. When, in an instant, it disappeared completely from sight to the south. It seemed to start moving and then it was just gone.  We have been living in the same house for almost 6 years now. I am married for 9 years. I work full time and attend school part time. We have no kids, but we do have 4 dogs and 4 cats. I was at home and my mother was asleep upstairs. My husband was at work last night working the graveyard shift. We are a very normal couple. We do believe in other life on other planets because we have seen crafts in the past.  One night a very long time ago a triangle shaped craft flew above our house without a sound. My husband and I both witnessed it. When my Dad was alive he witnessed another craft that seemed to come in with a storm and disappear instantly. My husband noticed a craft above our home one night moving erratically in the sky that took off to the north at speeds beyond anything he has ever seen. In the 6 years we have been in our current home we have witnessed at least 4 incidents like this. This one was so close and unbelievable I had to report it!;42.338225;-88.2663684782609
