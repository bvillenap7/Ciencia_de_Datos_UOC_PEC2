((HOAX??))  I thought they were birds but the way they were flying didn't make sense.;2010-05-03 15:45:00;30 secs.;I thought they were birds but the way they were flying didn't make sense I now realize after many years of research to come to the conclusion that space is filled with life. People are stuck on life can not live in space because of the lack of atmosphere and exstreme cold temperatures.  Drop this theory and it all makes sense.  There are creatures that come and go in our atmosphere.  I say this because iv'e seen them.  These were not your everyday earth inhabiting animal.  Flying in and out of a cloud.  My math is right on.  These were swooping at speeds excessing 500 mph. These were living things and not aircraft.  Nor were they alien aircraft.  These were living creatures flying in our SKIES........And yes I would like to talk with one of you.  I don't think this sighting should go un-noticed.
