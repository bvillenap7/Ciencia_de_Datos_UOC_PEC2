This was when you can still see the stars in the S.W. burbs of Chicago. I can't remember the exact date or year. I was 6, 7, or 8 years old. It was hot out so it was in the summer and it was pretty dark out by 21:00 hrs. We were all facing N. and looking straight up. Out of the corner of my eye I seen a flash or streak of light come in from my left. Immediately I thought it was a meteor because of the speed and distance it was in the sky. Then the really amazing part was when it changed directions twice without slowing down and zipped away just as fast as it arrived. My Father didn't see it and my Brother said He did but I don't remember exactly what He said at the time. There was no dout that thing was not from this planet.  The details again: Streak of light from S.W. to N.E. Very high altitude,upper atmosphere at least. Zig Zag pattern at the tail end of streak. destinct triangular shape at each point it changed direction (reminded me of the little ship in the video game Asteroids by Atari.) The speed of the thing was what you would expect a meteor to be travaling at. The size was about the size of a pencil eraser held at arms length. With the altitude it was at it must have been very large if it were at ground level. It was just an outline of a triangle really, I don't know if it had its own light source or it was glowing due to the speed and the atmosphere itself, but all three sides were very distinct as it changed directions both times. First and only sighting so far but it was the real thing so i'm very satisfied. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));41.7431;-87.8065999999999
