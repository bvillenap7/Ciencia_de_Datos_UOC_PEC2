I pointed them out to my granddaughter and told her they were not fireworks or airplanes.  I was excited and kept telling her to watch.but she was not interested.   She just said, Yeah,yeah,yeah ufo's gramma. A few minutes later I spotted another one traveling the same route and watched it to try to determine what it was but couldn't compare it to anything.   Shortly after my daughter came out of the house and another single one came by and she noticed right away that it was strange.  She immediately quipped that it was a UFO.  I stared at this one too trying to determine what kind of light it was and because it was slow moving I came to the conclusion that it was just the government moving some new  aircraft around and with all the activity in the sky no one would notice.;41.7431;-87.8065999999999
