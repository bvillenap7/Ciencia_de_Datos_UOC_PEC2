silver saucer in day time over house;1974-09-20 14:00:00;5minutes;silver saucer in day time over house In 1974 my brother and I were playing outside in the country near Lynn Center, Illinois.  We had been playing for about an hour when my brother needed to go inside and use the restroom.  We had been playing in an old car that my parents were not using that was parked near the garage.  It was a very sunny Saturday but there were clouds in the sky.  I was approximately nine years old and my brother was twelve.  When my brother went inside to use the restroom, I waited a few minutes and got out of the old car.  As I came around the side of the car and garage and was looking straight at the side of the house, I looked up and in the sky, to my right, the back of the house was a large, silver saucer.  It moved slowly over the house casting a shadow on the house and the side of the yard.  I began screaming for my mom and dad, as soon as I began screaming the saucer moved over the house and the side yard towards me and moved to my left over a willow tree.  It immedi! ately shot straight up into the sky.  It was almost instantaneous.  My parents and brother came running out just as it shot straight up, they could see what looked to be something a bit smaller than a quarter in the sky but they did not see the size of it when it was over the house.;41.2888;-90.3304
