Good health and good vision.   Took dog out for evening walk on Saturday, May 27, 2006, at exactly 9:12 pm. Sky was covered with coulds.  There was rain predictions for later at night.  As I walked out of the house....I looked up in the sky, looking northwest, to check for any clearance in the sky and to see if it will rain as to make the decision to go for a 20 minute walk with my dog.   My dog Lear, does not like to get wet...and he refused to walk and was heading back home.   I took another look at the sky and there was absolutely no visible sky, stars, etc....it was a gray dark evening....I looked at my watch, it was exactly 9:12 pm. As I looked up at the sky , three bright ligths appeard in the sky.....they were evenly spaced.   I watched the formation for about 8 seconds.......two more light appeard below the three and about 8 seconds following another light lit up about the same distance from the two lights as the two lights had from the first three. It was a perfect cone shape...or an inverted Christmas Tree shape.   The light persisted shining for another 5 to 8 seconds.....and went out all at once.   In another five sconds the two light went on again and remained bright for about 8 seconds and then all the light went out.   There was no sound from jet plane to be heard since O'Hare Air Post is not far away and at times planes fly directly over Northbrook on take offs.    The lights were stationary and there was no sound of any airplane at that time.;42.1217645161291;-87.8392903225806

Sept. 4 2016, a bright white light streaks over Northbook from west to east;2016-09-04 03:40:00;2-3 seconds;Sept. 4 2016, a bright white light streaks over Northbook from west to east On September 4th at approximately 3:40am I was driving east on Illinois 68 (Dundee Rd).  I was just west of and approaching the local post office (60062) and approximately 0.5 miles west of Illinois 43 (Waukegan Rd.}  I noted, and was literally startled/frightened as a bright white light appeared from behind on the driverâ€™s side of the car {north}.  The light appeared to be traveling east with a slight northern pitch.   It seemed to be coming from a higher altitude to a lower altitude with I would say a 5-degree angle with a slight arc rather than straight line of descent as it came into and disappeared from my view over the tree tops of the Somme Prairie Nature Preserve. The sighting lasted 2-3 seconds at most.  I heard no sound, an am unable to accurately describe the distance the light was from myself or the speed it was traveling.  The object had no aura and left no trail nor had a trail of light such that a rocket would have. I am male, age 49, and a Registered Nurse. I was returning home from a friends on this early morning.;42.1217645161291;-87.8392903225806
