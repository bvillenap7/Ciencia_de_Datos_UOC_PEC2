The entire left side of my car appears to be scorched but no paint was removed.;2008-11-04 21:20:00;5-10 seconds;The entire left side of my car appears to be scorched but no paint was removed. I was driving 40-45 miles per hour heading north toward I-94 East towards Chicago on Lake Cook Road.  While I was in the middle lane, I felt a nudge on the left of my car which made my car shift to the right.  I did not swerve out of the lane and gained control back quickly.   I slowed down and as I got my bearings, I realized that my left side mirror was knocked off and so I turned right onto Revere Drive and put on my hazard lights.   I got out of the car and saw that I had several dents on the side of my car.  There were two that were deeper and larger than the others one was located in front of the rear wheel and the other was in the center of the driver door.   I called 911 to file a police report and the officer said that I was side swiped by another car but, there were not any cars around me before or after the hit and also there were no paint scratches from other cars on my car.;42.1217645161291;-87.8392903225806
