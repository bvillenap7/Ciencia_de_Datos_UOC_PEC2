Trying to figure out what constellation I was looking at,  I  was startled to see one of the stars that form the belt,...TAKE OFF!..  It just moved away at a very measured speed,while previously stationary in the sky , (for what seemed to be about 10 minutes)...looking like just another star!.. I followed it across the sky until it just faded out...that ..was on 2/14/13. On 2/15/13, same exact time..went out with dog to see these same 2 stars visable. again.. (Minus the third moving star)   All of  the sudden up comes this moving star..(or craft ?   Drone??)   it rises and drifts over to the original place in the orions belt string of stars placement..stops dead in TRACKS!  HOLDS FOR A MOMENT! THEN REVERSES DIRECTION! THEN RESUMES ITS ORIGINAL TTRACK...FADES OUT AGAIN!   Kinda freaked by this, this happened in the northern sky and there is NO orions belt in the northern sky at 6 am.. This could not be a satalite,as they do not stop and go or reverse direction..although it appeared as a bright star,as bright as the others in what I originaly thought was the belt of orion,I t was something else for sure..any thoughts?

Large Super Bright White Stationary Light, Stationary, Lakemoor, Spring Grove, Il. 2:09 AM - 2:30AM NW Sky.;2019-01-04 02:09:00;20 minutes;Large Super Bright White Stationary Light, Stationary, Lakemoor, Spring Grove, Il. 2:09 AM - 2:30AM NW Sky. Rideshare experience  While driving for Uber, noticed a large super bright stationary light in what I would guess was the NW sky.  My passenger and I watched it for roughly 20 minutes between Lakemoor, Il and Spring Grove, Il.  It never moved.  Then somewhere after 20-25 minutes, it disappeared.  I went to see if it was still there while driving and it was gone.  It certainly was not an airplane in que, loitering for landing permission at Ohare.  It was stationary for at least 20 minutes without changing in size or brightness.  While I chose there were lights on the object, I never saw an object, merely the lights on the object.;42.4415;-88.2285
