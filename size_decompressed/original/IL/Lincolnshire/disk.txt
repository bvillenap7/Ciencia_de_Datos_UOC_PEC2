Perfect bottom of saucer type hole pushing down through cloud layer 1/4/2008 Driving home from work saw the strangest thing I have ever witnessed in my 55 years. Punching through a cloud layer appeared to be a huge saucer shape actually forcing the clouds downward below it. I thought at the time that it must be just a rare weather event and even though it held my attention for the next half hour of the drive home, I dismissed it as just being rare but a natural thing. At home I read the news on the net and then went on to u-tube and I could not believe my eyes! I watched a video from the other side of the world showing the exact thing that I had just witnessed! Exact!The size they gave was Exactly the same as what I saw! Identical!;42.1996;-87.9255
