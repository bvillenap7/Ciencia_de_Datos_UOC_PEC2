It was a dark mass in the sky with no lights, and moved in complete silence. My girlfriend and I were standing in my driveway looking up at the moon when she pointed out the object.  It had no lights at all, and moved without any sound.  It just a big black object that was heading south about 100 feet in the air at a slow steady pace.  It was a bright night so the object was silloutted in the sky.  It was very boxy in overall appearace but not completely.  Its structure was simillar to that of a plane, If you cut off the tail fin and then crashed it through a split level house.  The object continued heading south untill it disappeared beyond the tree line.;41.8872666666666;-88.1999254237291
