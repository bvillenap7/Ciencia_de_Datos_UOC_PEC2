Craft just disappeared.;2016-08-30 11:00:00;5 seconds;Craft just disappeared I was driving on Illinois Route 59 in west Chicago, Illinois.  I looked up and saw a silver cigar type craft.  The sun hit it and I saw the reflection.  I thought it was a united airlines jet, as the color was spot on match.  But within a few seconds it just vanished!  Blue sky no clouds.  The craft was about 6-8000 feet.   I watch southwest on final approach from Joliet to Midway airport.   13 years in law enforcement I've never seen a jet just disappear.  I'm at a loss for words;41.8872666666666;-88.1999254237291
