When we were finished we went down to the lake and sat for a while.  We were facing north.    It was around 2:00 p.m. on a calm sunny day with a few cumulus clouds in the sky. My husband looked up and asked, What is that?   I looked up and a metallic object was traveling from east to west at an extreme rate of speed.  It was approximately 20,000 to 30,000 feet up.  It flew just west of us and stopped suddenly at the edge of a cloud.  Just stayed there motionless.   Then it started gyrating like a plate would do if you spun it on its edge and the motion it would make as it started to slow down.  It then stopped gyrating and stayed there at the edge of the cloud for approximately 5 min.   Suddenly it came down at about a 45-degree angle at an extreme rate of speed and went behind the tree line.  I thought it was going to crash but we heard nothing and did not see it come up again.  It was completely silent. We could not determine the exact shape of the object but it was not cigar shaped or spherical.  It appeared to be somewhat triangular when it was gyrating.;42.2566;-88.7515
