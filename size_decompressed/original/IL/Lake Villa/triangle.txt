One night I was unable to sleep and so I was listening to music.  Suddenly I saw a bright light outside a window.  I looked out it and saw three lights that moved at the same time and rate.  The lights were in a triangle.  A light in the middle of the three lights, that couldn't be seen before, flashed red while the others turned off.  Then the red light shut off and the others lights turned back on. The craft appeared to freak out when it flashed the red light because it began going back and forth at extraordinary speeds very recklessly.  It then seemed to control its self because its movements were more orderly.  It went north, then south, and then north, and sped off at speeds that must have exseeded 100MPH south, past the horizon.;42.3816;-88.0025999999999

PD));2008-03-17 23:00:00;about 1 minute;TRIANGLE ARRANGED LIGHTS IN LAKE COUNTY, ILLINOIS One night, I saw lights in the night sky (there were different amounts lighting at a time between 3 and 12) in the shape of a triangle (but that's not to say that they weren't attached to something shaped other than triangular).   They moved together PERFECTLY.  I saw it fly from north to south to east to west and then it flew out of sight to the south.  It moved to fast for it to be an aircraft and took to extreme of turns.
