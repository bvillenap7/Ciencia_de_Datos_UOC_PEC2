It was transparent, blueish color & had what appeared to be a flame of fire flicking in the interior.  The craft made absolutely no noise as it traveled due north in a complete straight line. This is not a hoax and the hair on the back of my neck is still standing up.   Please let me know if you have received simular sightings of this type in this area.  I have never ever seen anything like this in my 50 years of life ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.  PD));42.3816;-88.0025999999999
