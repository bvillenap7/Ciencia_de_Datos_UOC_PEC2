I saw more flashes then noticed these things were flying in an elongated circle.  They were going in and out of a cloud....  They were going round and round...  The circle was tilted at an angle....  Weird....   They were zig Zagging when they went back into the cloud....  They were dark colored against the cloud and white against the blue sky...  After doing this strange maneuver they shot off in different directions faster than anything I've seen before....  Has anyone ever seen anything like this before???;42.3816;-88.0025999999999
