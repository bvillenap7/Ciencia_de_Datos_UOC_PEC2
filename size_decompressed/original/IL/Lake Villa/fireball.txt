Fire ball in the sky, no sound;2016-04-24 21:00:00;1 minute;Fire ball in the sky, no sound Red lights, looked like a fire ball.  Thought it was a chopper, but had no sound.  Went from southeast to the northwest.  It was gaining altitude as it passed.  When it passed by it still looked the same.  Was moving very fast.  Had my camera, with a zoom handy, so I took a picture.  When I zoomed in it looked like it was on fire, but had a silhouette in the front of the fire.
