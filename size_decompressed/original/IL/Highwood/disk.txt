Flying Disk  North of Chicago;2012-02-21 20:40:00;10 Seconds;Flying Disk  North of Chicago At about 8:40PM February 21, 2012, I took my dog out side to run around and go to the bathroom. I had decided to bring my pair of binoculars along to see Venus which was quite bright.  I saw Venus in my binoculars and saw what I thought was a private jet or small airplane.  I focused in on the object and I noticed it was the shape of a classic 1940s-50s 'Flying Saucer.'  It was a dark metallic color with about 5-7 porthole windows in the middle/side of the craft.  It was relatively close to the ground and there was no sound.  I believe there was a white strobe light on the top but the bottom of the craft did have a slow pulsing red light.  I moved slightly from west to the east towards Lake Michigan then I lost sight of the U.F.O.  I have seen (and reported) strange things in the sky that were simply unexplained...and I guess this is one too.;42.1955;-87.8146
