Dark gray against the dark blue night sky. I was outside with my buddy when i noticed this boomerang shaped 'mass' with no lights on it floating the night sky.  It was about the size of a half dollar coin at arms length.  It was very dark gray against the  dark blue sky with no lights. No sound was heard from this object.  It moved really fast then made a sharp turn and disappeared.  My friend and I both saw the object leaving us both saying 'what the heck was that?'   I never seen anything like it.
