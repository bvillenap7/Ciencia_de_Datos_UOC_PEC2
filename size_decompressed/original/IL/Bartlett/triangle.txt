Paper lanterns in UFO-like formation.;2013-07-04 17:00:00;10 minutes;Paper lanterns in UFO-like formation. This is a non-UFO sighting, but I suspect you will get a number of UFO reports regarding it so I decided to inform you of it. My wife and I and some relatives were attending the Bartlett, Il Independence Day Festivities known as Bartlett Fest.  At approximately 17:00:00 we observed what appeared to be a triangular formation of orange lights appearing from the south (S) and heading north (N).  The lights had a orange, flame-like glow and were low in the sky. Initially, we found this very disconcerting as we watched this formation slowly drift off to the N.  As the lights vanished out of sight another appeared from the S, this time lower in the sky, and we were able to observe that it was in fact a paper lantern.  I was able to zoom my camera (Nikon Coolpix P510, 42x optical zoom) on the object to confirm it was indeed a paper lantern.  However, I was not able to get a clear photograph of the object due to the difficulty of using autofocus on a moving target.  Approximately 3 - 4 more lanterns were observed moving from the S to N before the 17:30:00 fireworks display.   On our way home, at approximatel! y 18:00:00, we observed another paper lantern over Greenbrook Ave. in Hanover Park, Il heading from the S to the N.  This was again low enough that we could clearly discern it as a paper lantern.  I am writing this because the structure of these objects is hard to discern from a distance, and the initial triangle formation will no doubt be reported several times as a UFO.;41.9778000000001;-88.2017999999999
