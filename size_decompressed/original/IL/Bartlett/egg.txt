Object hovered in one spot in west sky 5 minutes (during fireworks show finale in north sky).   Finale ending, object darted south and slightly east then hovered again only to disappear 2 minutes later into night sky.   Observers were company vice president and family, and a couple, and a family, next to us on blankets watching fireworks.   Object diverted many people's attention away from fireworks finale, which is always the best part.  The way it hovered without sound or movement, then purposefully darted away , was way too fast for a plane or helicopter.  All were stunned.   Can't believe WE saw this in person or wouldnt believe it.;41.9778000000001;-88.2017999999999
