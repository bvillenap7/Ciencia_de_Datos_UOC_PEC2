Mysterious white orbs in night sky - moving in a repetitive sequence - within the same circular area - which stayed in the same spot .;2003-10-29 20:15:00;45 minutes;Mysterious white orbs in night sky - moving in a repetitive sequence - within the same circular area - which stayed in the same spot . Mysterious white orbs in night sky - moving in a repetitive sequence - within the same circular area - although staying in the same spot in the sky for 45 minutes. My husband called me to take a look at something strange in the night sky. At first I thought that maybe it was just some sort of a light show for some sort of a Halloween event.  The more I think about it - the more I begin to think that this was no ordinary light.  Although I did NOT see any disk shaped metallic object, I DID however see a series of unexplainable lights moving around in a repetetive sequence - within the confines of a circular area.  The circular area where these lights were stayed the same, although the lights that were moving within this circular area moved in a repetitive sequence similar to a kaleidescope - only these were white lights - with NO beam as to show where they were coming from.  They seemed to just be in the same spot - made no noise - were the color of white spot ligts used to light up the sky for airplaines, but as I said before - there was NO BEAM to show them as coming from any where from the ground.  They were just in the sky.  I know that we had Northern Lights in the sky earlier that day (this was yesterday) but they would not be moving in such an arranged repetitive formation.  These lights looked as if there were 2 sets of 4 white lights - all equally spaced apart - 4 on the outside of a circle - and 4 on the inside - and 1 stationary light in the center that never moved. As 1 pair of 4 lights joined eachother at the center, the other set of 4 lights moved apart - eqal distance from eachother - away from the center.  Then they would switch off. Finally ALL 8 lights would shift in a clockwise 45 degree angle and the sequence would start all over again.  1 set of 4 lights moving toward the center as the other set moved away from the center - then the other set would come back to the center as the original set moved back towards the center - then all 8 white orbs about 3 feet in diameter would rotate again about 45 degrees in a clockwise direction. It just kept doing the same sequence for about 45 minutes.  In the same circular area.  It was about as high as 2-3 power lines if stacked one on top of another going straight up.  It was the diameter of about a large family home - and it was about 1 city block away from MY house !!  These lights made no noise.  There was no beam of light showing any origination point - as with sky lights used to guide airplanes or lights that might come from a light house.  Nothing like that.  Just up there on their own.  Repeating a type of kaleidescope sequence of repetitive movements - although the center light was the only one that never moved. The lights looked as if they were coming from the underbelly of some sort of circular shaped craft - although I NEVER saw any actual craft.  Just the lights. But it was very weird - I never saw anything like it before - and then it was gone. My husband and I came home for a moment and when we came back out again - this time they were gone, so we never saw how they disappeared or if they flew away or just disappeared... but they were out there in the same spot - doing the same thing for about 45 minutes.  It MAY have been a natural phenomenon - but why would a natural phenomenon have lights moving in such a repetetive sequence and stay in the exact same spot the entire time for almost an hour.  If it was some sort of a man made light show - then why was there no beam of light showing a source of origin? It was weird.  10 people saw it.  1 witness was a former marine - with lots of medals of honor.  Not a flakey person.  He was the first to admit that it might actually be a UFO, but that we could not see the craft if the craft was dark - camouflaged against the dark sky.  Only the lights below the craft would be visible. The more I think about it - as hard to admit as it is - it's a possible explanation. The only question with this is - why was the craft not moving for over 45 minutes? It was weird.  Has any one else seen anything similar to this??;41.9778000000001;-88.2017999999999
Light followed by military next day.;2009-12-03 20:35:00;5-10 minutes;Light followed by military next day. It was night time and I was having trouble falling asleep.  I looked out the window and I saw a yellow/orange light glide across the field.  I watched as it moved all the way to the edge of the window.  When I leaned over to see if the object was still moving in the same direction, I saw it jump into the sky and fade away.  When the object flew away, I heard some noises on the roof.  Even though it was winter, I do not think that snow on the rooftop would make such loud noises. The next day, I woke up and decided to look around the house and sure enough all of the snow on the roof was gone.  The roof seemed to also be burned.  I decided to check out the area where the object has been flying and I was told by two men in snow camouflage that I was not able to go to that area for a few days.  These men were also holding something but they were not rifles or guns, but some kind of instrument.  I later saw a Boeing Chinook helicopter fly over the area in what loo! ked like a designated path. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));41.9778000000001;-88.2017999999999
Red disk shaped UFO over bartlett Illinois;2011-08-17 22:00:00;3 minutes;Red disk shaped UFO over bartlett Illinois What we thought to be a flaming grocery store bag hovered through a field next to my house.  After realising it was something odd, we took out a camera.  After turning it on the craft or light or whatever it was shot 30,000 feet into the air and hovered ther efor a good 3 mintues before flickering out like a candle.;41.9778000000001;-88.2017999999999
Chicago area 8/11 colored spinning lights - multiple objects.;2012-08-11 21:30:00;15 minutes;Chicago area 8/11 colored spinning lights - multiple objects. Witnesses saw 5 objects low on the horizon composed of changing-color, spinning lights. Se were unable to actually see the physical craft the lights would have assumingly been a part of.  They seemed to hover for about 3-5 minutes, then rose up and continued to rise until they were no longer visible. Among those of us who saw, anywhere from 6-10 craft were counted. While they were hovering and then beginning to move, they appeared to be lined up in formation. In the immediate aftermath (15-30 minutes after), it seemed the jets in the area were flying much lower than normal toward O'Hare, and there were several what looked like low-orbit satellites going by. (normally, we see what looks like a dim star going by - these were more like planet-brightness lights moving across.  we felt as though the jets and the &quotlow-orbit satellites&quot may have possible been in response to whatever the colored/spinning lights event was.;41.9778000000001;-88.2017999999999
Steady bright object at sunset in western sky;2020-06-11 19:21:00;2 minutes;Steady bright object at sunset in western sky Observed in the western sky a bright object with a bright steady glow with no movement. for 2 to 3 mintues. It was at the 11 o'clock position to the setting sun. The object than just disappeared no dimming or fading at all. The sky was clear with no cloud cover. This was the brightest object in the western sky other than the setting sun. No commercial or private planes in that section of the sky.  I have previous law enforcement background. I am also a ham radio operator and a trained weather spotter.  I own my own business which is a reporting service that uses mobile apps and pictures to report what we see.;41.9778000000001;-88.2017999999999
