I stood under it for about 30 to 40 minutes. This was back in the late summer, early fall of 1978 in Bartlett, Ill. My mom, my sister and I were on our way home from Bingo in (Streamwood, Il), which was a Friday evening. We had just gotten to Rt 20 and a block from turning onto North Ave when my sister who was sitting in the front seat noticed some lights in the sky blinking. She pointed this out to both me and our mother. What I seen was BIG and saucer shape. When I say big, I mean bigger than a commercial Air plane. This UFO was about 100 ft just about above us. My mom , who was driving, became scared and did a U-turn on Rt 20 and drove down the road about 2 miles. The UFO continued to be just about above us. She then turned around again and she at this point decided to go report it to the police dept. She was scared and I guess she felt that she would be ok if we just went to the police dept since it was following us. It followed us all the way to the police dept (I know it sounds strange a UFO following you, but it is true). When we got to the police dept, it disappeared, just gone in a split second! We talked to a police officer and told him about what we seen. He told us that “100’s of people have reported seeing this”. He just acted nonchalant like no big deal. The UFO that hovered above us did not make any sound what so ever. It was quiet, no vibration, the only way you knew it was there was the lights that went around the craft in a circular motion.  The officer reassured my mom that it was ok and when we went to leave we looked to see if it was there and it was not. The police station was about 10 blocks to our apartment on Wayne Ct, in Bartlett. We were heading down the road and as we got to the corner of N. Marion Ave, Wayne Ct and E. Taylor it suddenly appeared out of nowhere.  We continued on to our apartment on Wayne Ct. My mom pulled in the drive way and my sister jumped out of the car scared and ran into the apartment and told my boyfriend ( Derrick Fender, of Elgin, Il) and my other sister and her boyfriend (Mike ! Kessel l of Hanover Park, Il) that there was a UFO at the end of the street. They all ran out of the apartment and went to where My mom stood by the car. I walked down to the end of the street where the UFO was hovering.  Again no noise at ALL none. No wind, no noise just the lights making a circular pattern around the ship.  My sister, who had been in the car with me and my mom, came back outside and yelled at me “Get back here they are going to take you”. I was several months pregnant with my first child. I did not feel fear at all. I was more curious that fearful.  I stood under the ship, which I looked up to and it was about 100 ft above me and was much, much bigger than an airplane. As I stood there looking up I could not see what it looked like at all. It was as if it was transparent and I could see the stars through it. However I could also see the lights (green, yellow, red, and orange) going around the perimeter of the ship that outlined it circular shape.  I stood there looking, for awhile about 30 to 45 minutes, so I was told by my family. However, to me it was as if I was only there for a couple of minutes, it was as if time stood still. I know that the neighbors seen this also as some of them where outside watching.  Suddenly it just disappeared in thin air, did not fly off, just disappeared in a split second.  I stood there for a few moments and then walked back to where my family was.  There has only been one picture I have found on the internet that closely resembles what I seen and that is this (note this is NOT the actual UFO just what it looks like) This is Similar to the ship I seen <a href=http://s35.photobucket.com/albums/d199/heaven-sent/?action=view&current=UFOthatIseen.gif target=_blank><img src=http://i35.photobucket.com/albums/d199/heaven-sent/UFOthatIseen.gif border=0 alt=Photobucket></a>  [IMG]http://i35.photobucket.com/albums/d199/heaven-sent/UFOthatIseen.gif[/IMG] http://i35.photobucket.com/albums/d199/heaven-sent/UFOthatIseen.gif ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
