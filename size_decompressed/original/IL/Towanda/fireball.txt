She immediately called my friend, her boyfriend, and myself outside to see it.  Hurrying outside and looking straight into the sky we all see a large, circular, red/orange light slowly moving across the sky coming from the south and heading north.  The object appeared to be gliding as it was moving too slow for a plane and too quickly and too close to be a satellite. The object was visible to us for about four minutes until it disappeared into the sky, continuing its original pace.;40.5496;-88.8904
