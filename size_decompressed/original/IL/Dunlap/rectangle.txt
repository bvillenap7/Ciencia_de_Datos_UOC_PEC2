A bright geometric shape with an equally bright tail streaks down.;2001-08-13 23:10:00;1 sec;A bright geometric shape with an equally bright tail streaks down. At about 11:10 pm on August 13, 2001, I was driving north on IL Route 40 toward IL Route 90 which was a few miles ahead.  My wife also saw it as she was sitting in the right front seat.  Our son sitting in the back seat behind me did not see it.  It was a very clear night and the massing of the Milky Way could be seen just by looking out and up.  There were several private airplanes out and about with flashing lights that were easily seen (but not near the object).  From my vantage point, in front of me and a little to the right (at, say, one o'clock there came streaking down with a long tail (at 15 to 20 degrees from vertical) a small parallelogram with sharp angles, for the corners did not look to be right angles.  I remember that the parallelogram was a double image but I attribute that to the hour of the day and I could not blink to clear my vision or I would have missed it.  My wife did not recall a double image.  If this were painted on my windshield it would have been about 1/4 long and 1/8 wide and the tail would have been 9 - 10 inches long. The sides of the parallelogram on the right were lower that the ones on the left. To me the color looked blue green, object and tail.  To my wife, she said it looked more toward yellow.  I did see it though a windshield that had a tinted top edge, but I could not reproduce the color by looking at white road signs.  It looked big enough and close enough that we thought it was going to hit the nearby fields and make an explosion or something.  It did not.  It lasted long enough for me to say,Geeezz!  Look at THAT! and for my wife to respond. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and found him to be quite credible in his presentation of the facts surrounding his sighting.
