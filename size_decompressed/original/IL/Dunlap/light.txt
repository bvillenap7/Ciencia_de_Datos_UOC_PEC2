A plane was flying north west.;2013-07-01 22:30:00;30 seconds;A plane was flying north west. A friend and I had been using lasers to point out constellations prior to the plane flying overhead. We ceased use of lasers prior to the planes appearance due to regulations and courtesy. As the plane passed overhead a light faded into visibility behind the plane accelerated above the plane and veered off at a 90 degree angle upward and toward the south. As if using the plane to hide on radar. It then proceeded to rapidly accelerate in a spiral formation while increasing altitude and disappeared with a small flash when it reached the center of this spiral. We were completely baffled and didn't talk to anyone about it because the assumption is you're either lying or crazy. I felt more comfortable with the recent news reports.;40.8422;-89.6402
