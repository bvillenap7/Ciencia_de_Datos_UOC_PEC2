The Titanic tear appeared with a gust and vanished without a trace.;2001-04-15 02:20:00;2 Minutes;The Titanic tear appeared with a gust and vanished without a trace. I was outside at 2:18 am becasue that is the time the Titanic sank 89 years ago. Well, i was looking up at the stars wondering how those people felt when I saw a flash of light come from behind me (North). I got scared because i thought it was lightning, and I turned around to see for sure. There were no clouds or anything, so i turned around. Maybe 30 seconds later it happened again and this time I felt a gust of wind also from the North. I looked up towards the sky and saw a bright shiney object moving very slightly in the sky. It was almost diamond/tear shaped and definitely not a planet, star or satellite. Im in an astronomy class and I know the difference between the 3 objects. So, I was a little scared and curious. I stood up (I forgot to mention I was on my roof) and waved at it, and then it disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  If this event, in fact, occurred, we question whether it had anything to do with the sinking of the Titanic.  PD));42.0272763779528;-88.0914566929134
