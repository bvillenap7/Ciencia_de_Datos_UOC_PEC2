Three small spheres come together to create the shape of a triangle;2011-05-01 12:00:00;15 seconds;Three small spheres come together to create the shape of a triangle During my lunch break at school (The Illinois Institute of Art, Schaumburg) on a clear sunny summer day at the schools parking lot I witnessed three white spheres appear out of thin air, move around each other and then form a triangular shape in the sky.  I was in my car with my door open eating lunch when I witnessed this.  I was looking up at the clear blue sky watching some airplanes fly by in the very far away distance when I saw these spheres appear out of nowhere.  Itâ€™s almost as if they appeared just for me, and I say that because they appeared in the exact area that my line of sight was at the entire time I was looking at the sky. After they appeared in the sky they danced around each other and then finished off with a triangular formation. After these spheres made that triangular formation in the sky I thought that they would be visible for a bit longer so I tried to take out my cellphone and try to get some video footage of the spheres but as I was reaching in my pocket to pull out my cellphone I saw them disappear into thin air the same way they had appeared.  I also believe that the mood that I was in might have played a factor in their appearance.  I was in a peaceful mood with a clear head, meaning that I did not have many if hardly any thoughts going through my mind at that time.
