Slow moving East Moving light intecepted by fast moving North Mover;2001-05-28 20:15:00;60 Seconds;Slow moving East Moving light intecepted by fast moving North Mover As a business owner, I often work until as late as 11PM -12PM and take my dog to a grassy area near our office where I stargaze and she does her business. On 5/28/2001 at 10:10PM CT in Schaumburg, IL I witnessed the following event while walking my dog in the office park where I work.   Visibility was moderate to good and the moon was clearly visible in the high SW sky.  I normally witness slow moving lights at least every other night which I generally assume are low orbiting satellites or other orbiting man made objects visible to the naked eye. This night proved to be no exception when I sited a slow moving light, which came into my visible horizon from the center of the constellation Orion on about a 15 degree arc westbound.  The slower then normal movement and higher than normal arc suggested a higher orbit to me.  The light was of the same power relative to the constellation, constant, clear and easily discernable.  After approximately 35 seconds the light was approximately 20 degrees past straight above me in my eastern horizon when a very fast moving light appeared overhead (I was lying on my back, looking up and slightly NE so overhead means S/SE).  This light crossed from my Southern horizon a few degrees east of due north to the first light in not more than 5 seconds. Its  speed initially startled me. This was too slow and deliberate and visible for too long to be falling debris or a meteorite.   Also, it was about twice as bright as the first light.  I took these facts to mean it was a very low altitude satellite.  My heart literally skipped a beat as the odds of catching two visible satellites crossing paths flashed in my mind.  Rather than simply cross paths, however, they met exactly.  The brighter, fast moving light was not visible after the intersection and the slower dimmer light seemed more slow and more dim and in fact disappeared within another 10 seconds.  While the first of these facts may be explained by the slow moving object exceeding my eastern horizon, it was at least 1/3 higher on that horizon when I lost site of it than in the Western horizon when I first sited it.  I see no simple explanation for the disappearance of the fast mover 20 degrees past directly overhead when I sited it at least 90 degrees in the Southern Horizon. I returned to the site today with a compass and took accurate readings from the very place I sat the night before (the grass was still pressed down).  The data above should be exact to within about 5 degrees.  The amazing fact is that I did not look at my watch.  A friend did call me when I just left the office on foot with my dog and the phone log read 9:45 on my friends phone.  It takes me 7 minutes to walk to our spot and as it was chilly night here, I started thinking about leaving after only 15 minutes. I own a software consulting company here in Schaumburg Illinois and consult for a specialty coatings company that caters to the U.S. Navy and U.S.A.F. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length with this witness, and we found him to be an exceptionally skilled observer and reporter of objective fact.  Under ordinary circumstances, we would have assumed that a witness who reported such an event would be describing two satellites, which happened to be visible in proximity to one another.  However, the witness in this case had allowed for such a possibility, and had rejected that on the basis of facts of the case.   Further, we observe that an orbitting body in polar orbit, traveling to the north, would not enter the Earth's shadow.  We share the witness's interest in this sighting.

UFO's seen over  O'Hare International Airport. at 1:30 AM 8/5/01;2001-08-05 01:30:00;10 minutes;UFO's seen over  O'Hare International Airport. at 1:30 AM 8/5/01 I've been using he J-Track 3d software to track satelites and saw one would be passing over soo so i went outside to look for it. I saw it pass, but as it did I saw what I believed to be another satelite but it was moving much faster and coming in from the west and heading east. I started watching it when it changed course slightly north. It was late so I thought I was tired and seeing things until it stopped and sat there for about 30 secs before it started moving again. This time due north and with a burst of speed I've never seen before. From my perspective it was not over O'hare airport. If I had tape measurer and held it up above my head with the sky behind it I would say it moved 4 feet in a flash. Then it seemed to be hiding behind some clouds over O'hare airport, darting in and out of a hole in one of the clouds. After about 5 minutes of this I ran and grabbed my camcorded to try to record it. I woke up my wife and asked her to come out but she was half asleep and told me I was dreaming so I ran outside with the camcorder. I couldn't see the satelite size objects in the viewfinder but recorded anyway and kept speaking so I could explain what I was seeing if the tape didn't come out. About 5 minutes later I saw another identical object come in from the south like the other did and seem to be dogfighting or just goofing around but doing loops around each other and having incredible bursts of speed. Sometimes it would go one way then the other so quick without seeming to stop. A few minutes later they started hiding in the clouds and I lost track of them.;42.0272763779528;-88.0914566929134
((NUFORC Note:  Probable Mars sighting.  PD))  Bright light over Schaumburg moving from the N to the S, and from the E to the W.;2005-11-01 21:10:00;still there at 22:10;Bright light over Schaumburg moving from the north to the south and from the east to the west  11/2/05 At first, appeared to be a star and then slowly moved from North to South and is now moving from East to West.  It's quite bright, but we can't make out a consistent shape.   My grandson thinks it looks like a bug (a beetle) with eyes in front.  It looks like a ladybug with the wings folded down.  I can only say with certainty that it is very bright.   The movements are not in a straight line.  Sometimes it seems to hover - then, move up, down,  north, south, but is making steady progress from north to south, and east to west.   It is now 22:17 and it's still moving from east to west.

White light with greenish aura falling from sky over Schaumburg toward the East.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor??  PD));2009-02-02 21:10:00;Less than 10 seconds;White light with greenish aura falling from sky over Schaumburg toward the East A white ball of light with greenish tinge fell slowly from the sky.  Viewed from my window looking to the East in Schaumburg, IL.  Was only in sight for about five seconds, came into view in my window and then disappeared behind the houses.  No tail (falling star, meteor, etc.) and no flashing (plane lights, etc.)  Almost looked like remnants of fireworks falling. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor??  PD));42.0272763779528;-88.0914566929134
Unusual light in sky slow moving almost comes to a stop and slowly moves on;2012-06-22 09:45:00;1;unusual light in sky slow moving almost comes to a stop and slowly moves on My best description of the object would be it was similar in shape to a planet it was a constant brightness a whitish color . at first we thought it was a very large satellite it's motion was constant at first similar to a satellite not fast at all but then it started to slow down  and slightly curve it's path. this when I really rose to attention then it came to an almost complete stop and slghtly curved back and then slowly continued on it's path.  It was not a visible craft in any form but looked like a star or planet that could move it was completley  silent which also made it unusual seeing we are near O'hare and I though it maybe a plane but there were no flashing green and red lights  it was circular and made no noise like the planes do we see planes in our yard at 1000 ft and 30,000 ft all the time i this was not even close to the way they look. It was not a satellite because it slowed down and curved we seee them quite often and they are much smalle! r and have a constant path across the sky. My wife and I are not ufo believers and are not telling our neighbors because I always said I thought UFO's are bullshit and dont want to look stupid but I googled how to report ufos and here i am I wanted to report in hopes somebody else in our schaumburg,IL area saw it.;42.0272763779528;-88.0914566929134
We were sitting outside, when I saw 2 burnt orange color lights floating in the southeast sky, below the half shaped moon. There was no;2012-07-28 21:00:00;2 minutes;We were sitting outside, when I saw 2 burnt orange color lights floating in the southeast sky, below the half shaped moon. There was nothing blinking, and no sound.  I said &quotWhat is that&quot and my husband looked and said he didnt know. i DO believe in UFO's, but he does not!  He said, What happened to it?  because it blinked out.   Then we saw 4 more coming from the same direction, in a row.  They moved along the same path, then just faded.   By this time I had run to get the binoculars, but when we both took turns looking, all we really saw was a lighted round-like orange color shape.  Again, no blinking lights or sounds.  We saw airplanes moving in the sky thru-out this event, but these were NOT airplanes!  We saw a total of 7-9 lights.;42.0272763779528;-88.0914566929134
Bright circular light moves and fades to black.;2013-06-28 23:15:00;15 seconds;Bright circular light moves and fades to black. round bright light traveling slowly from east to west , that had somewhat constant motion and then slowed and very clearly faded to dark within 2 seconds and disappeared.  This is the second time we have seen what we think is possible military type craft? it is not like a flying saucer or space ship it is a bright circular light that moves somewhat slowly but does change speeds gradually we are near O'hare but it is clearly not a plane we want to know if anybody else has seen this activity;42.0272763779528;-88.0914566929134
When I first saw the light i thought it was a unusual looking star, It was very high in the sky, after ~30 seconds the light start;2015-11-11 19:45:00;5 minutes;When i first saw the light i thought it was a unusual looking star, It was very high in the sky, after about 30 seconds the light started moving very quickly and had two red lights on opposite ends, in a matter of seconds it traveled west almost out of view and then almost instantly returned to its original location, i thought at first maybe it was a helicopter because of the way it was moving in all directions but it was far too high and fast to be a helicopter. i called the local police who transfered me to 911 distpatch and he was not able to tell me if anyone else had reported it but i know other people had to have seen this thing because it was visible from probably anywhere in schaumburg and it was very noticeable. I also took a picture with my phone, just looks like a light but when you soom you can see what looks like a horseshoe shape. Never been a UFO believer until last night because whatever it is i saw is not like anything i have ever seen befor! e and 100% positive it was not a plane or copter, there was actually a plane that flew under it at one point, the light was much much higher than the plane.;42.0272763779528;-88.0914566929134
Orange-red lights traveling in formation quickly over suburban sky;2016-12-31 23:35:00;4 minutes;Orange-red lights traveling in formation quickly over suburban sky Observed fast-moving linear-appearing procession of 14 orange-red lights approaching from south, a brief pause followed by 3 of same, heading in northeast trajectory.  No sound.   It didn't resemble any aircraft, Chinese lanterns, or fireworks.  Local Police Department had not received similar calls.;42.0272763779528;-88.0914566929134
Orb of light crosses the sky and turns sharply in Chicago Suburbs.;2018-09-26 23:00:00;5-10 minures;Orb of light crosses the sky and turns sharply in Chicago Suburbs. Leaving my office after working well into the night, an amber orb of light moved across the sky above me to the south of my location and then seemed to become multiple lights (still in one unit) and became more white colored.  The light blinked at an interval but not like any plane I’ve seen.  It made no sound yet was only a couple hundred feet above ground. It then turned west and south and I lost sight of it for a few seconds behind buildings as I drove. It then came flying back north right over me as I drove West it.  Then it got higher in the sky and trurned sharply east towards Chicago and paralleled interstate 90 (which I was now on going east as well) and it traveled around 90-100 mph before blinking out of site ahead of me.  I noticed several other small lights in the sky.  I felt some moved and were planes others may be stars.  But this area doesn’t get much visibility to stars because of light pollution.  This is O'Hare airport area, but this was not typical for flight patterns and it turned to fast and was too small to be a plane.  My cars engine light and and lights went on for the first time ever (the car is in great shape) after the incident.;42.0272763779528;-88.0914566929134
