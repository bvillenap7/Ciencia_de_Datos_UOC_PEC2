Mrs. ((name deleted)) was in the kitchen late one night, as she was washing dishes. She happened to look out the window, where the sink was over looking out into her backyard. She had seen this strange looking oval shape craft, as it was flying over her house. It made a strange eerie sound, as it landed out in the field of her backyard. She told me that small 3 creatures martains like beings, came out of their spacecraft looked around in the back yard. Mrs. ((name deleted)) had called the Police to report there were strange intruders in her back yard.

One brightly-lit oval took off from the ground into the sky.;1998-09-02 21:00:00;:30 secs;One brightly-lit oval took off from the ground into the sky. I was driving west on Algonquin Road, and I saw a streak go across the sky.  It started slow at first, near the ground, and then it took off really fast and got bigger as it got closer.  It was like a comet, but in reverse, like it was flying out instead of in.;42.0272763779528;-88.0914566929134
Two oval shapes seen in Chicago western suburbs, moving south. Friday, Feb.2;2007-02-02 16:30:00;20 minutes;Two oval shapes seen in Chicago western suburbs, moving south. Friday, Feb.2 At 4:30 p.m., Friday February 2nd I was traveling south from Schaumburg when I spotted two brightly lit, elliptical shapes in the sky. I have trouble gauging distances but I would say they were at least five to ten miles away.  They floated, or hovered, with no apparent propulsion system, moving south-southwest.  Between the shapes was a light that flashed every fifteen seconds.  What intrigued me most was the fact that the shapes did not change in distance between each other as they moved.  I was too far away to view any details, if there were any.  My initial thought was that they were cloud formations, but after seeing them move for twenty minutes I did not see any change to them, and they remained equidistant from each other.  Then I thought that they could have been a pair of airplanes pulling advertisement banners. I have seen these planes over the last few months, but they stayed fairly close to the Schaumburg region. These shapes were quite a distance away from Schaumburg.  They were not jets, blimps or other aircraft that Iâ€™ve seen before.  Anybody else see these things?
