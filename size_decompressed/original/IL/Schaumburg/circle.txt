I saw a bright star that was moving at a constant speed and it was too high for a plane. I told her to look straight up and she noticed the object as well. And there was no doubt in my mind that it was an alien craft of some sort. It moved in a zig-zag pattern and as it was moving, the light suddenly faded away. It did not blink light aircrafts do.
