At first I thougt it was a planet, but it became much larger.  As I continued north, it got larger and seemed to be very high up in the sky.  It appeared to have 8 to 10 smaller white objects flitting around it.  The main object was spherical in shape with the smaller objects also being round.  I saw the object for about 2 minutes before losing sight of to the right of my truck.  As I was moving, I could not tell if it was moving or not.;38.9691;-89.7684
