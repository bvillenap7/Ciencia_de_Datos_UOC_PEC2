Round black object flying North at high speed;2004-06-05 12:00:00;25 seconds;Round black object flying North at high speed I was swimming with my son in our pool alittle after noon yesterday when I noticed a round black object just below cloud level, it was in the southern sky flying North. It was flying at a very fast pace, no way it could have been a plane.  It was out of my sight in about 25 seconds. My son was very excited about this, my wife thinks we lost our minds.;40.7187909090909;-89.2410363636364
