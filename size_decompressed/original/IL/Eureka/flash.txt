Not sure if this was natural or unatural....;1999-08-15 22:45:00;3 secs;Not sure if this was natural or unatural.... I was coming out to my truck around 10:45...it was close to storming so this made me unsure if this event was lightning or not...but then after hearing some of the recent events I thought I'd let you know...there was a huge flash of light, and the sky seemed to light up as bright as day so I turned to see what had just happened and as I turned I saw up in the eastern sky what looked like about 5 fireballs in a horizontally stacked formation that at the moment I thought they resembled what looked like sperm swimming a short distance across the sky....they were bright white and the color of the sky around them was bluish/purple....the horizontal direction and quanity is what really made me question the lightning theory...not sure if this was natural or not.;40.7187909090909;-89.2410363636364
