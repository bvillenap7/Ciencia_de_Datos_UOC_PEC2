Noone believed us and we just didnt talk about it anymore   We were camping by a river about a mile away from town and a bright light all of a sudden showed up about 1000 yards above us.  It was just like daylight.  As we all stood up sevaral small lights swirled around us.  And passed in and out of us.  The largest light was maybe 50 yards across.  The light was very bright.  The smaller ones were basketball size and dimmer.  You could make out triangle forms inside.   The brighter light shot up to the sky and went up about 3 or 4 miles.  Then slowly the small ones followed.  The circlced around the bigger then just joined with it. They all went up until they were out of sight.    This was one of many contacts.  This is not a joke. It real. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));42.1009;-88.8695
