Bright orange spheres over central illinois;2007-12-03 06:50:00;5 mintues;Bright orange spheres over central illinois Letting dog outside. When I saw an orange flash (Thought it was a burning star that exploded) but then all around came white flashing lights that stayed for about five minutes then disappeared. Around two minutes later in the same location the orange glow came back in that same area followed by another miles away, thats when they both lit up three across in succession then faded to nothing and then diappeared. Very large. More people had to have seen it, the blacktop was busy. It looked as though it were pretty close to Manito. Never have seen anything like it before, very strange. Enough to make me report it.;40.4136;-89.7928
