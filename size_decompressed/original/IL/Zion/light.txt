Large bright light above far north Chicago suburbs;2010-07-08 23:00:00;1 minute;Large bright light above far north Chicago suburbs Very bright light in the sky over far north Chicago suburbs and western edge of lake Michigan.  This very bright lite was first noticed going slow from top of tree to open sky area at a very high altitude.  It was viewed moving into open sky area where it stopped.  We could verify this by surrounding trees and aircraft.  In the following 30-40 seconds its light dimmed to not viewable but several normal military jets could be seen as they had on night flying lights.  Entire event seemed to be above 40,000 feet. The entire event was silent.;42.4422;-87.8395999999999
Large bright light appeared for 10 seconds and then dissapeared.  ((NUFORC Note:  Witness formerly in U. S. Navy for 20 years.  PD));2013-05-29 23:35:00;10 seconds;large bright light appeared for 10 seconds and then dissapeared 11:35 P.M. central time I was outside having a cigarette.  I was facing West.  At about 250 degrees relative to north at an angle of 45 or 50 degrees from the horizon a very bright light appeared.  At first I thought It could be an airplane turning on a landing light. It got brighter over about 5 seconds and was drifting slightly down and to my right.   After 5 seconds if faded and disappeared.   I saw no aircraft in the area or any other light source.  It was like a huge bright spotlight. Range seemed to be very far away. No sound was present. I spent 20 years in the Navy and have observed many aircraft at night and this was completely different from anything I have seen.  It sent chills thru me.;42.4422;-87.8395999999999
