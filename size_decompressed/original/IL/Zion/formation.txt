6 to 8 lights in formation in eastern sky heading west.;2013-03-03 20:00:00;2-5 minutes;6 to 8 lights in formation in eastern sky heading west Looking east saw what I first thought was a formation of helicopters.  They were mostly in a single file line but there was at least one pair side by side.   They appeared to be coming closer heading west.  They each looked like a bright star colored white.  I did not see any blinking lights that would normally suggest an aircraft.   I also heard no noise that would be associated with helicopters.  Moving too slow to be airplane, almost hovering but moving closer.   Eventually each light disappeared.  Only thing I can think of at this point is that they could have been some sort of flares dropped by an aircraft or a hoax where somebody floated some flares or other illuminary source via balloon.;42.4422;-87.8395999999999
