3 round white lights in a triangle formation;2007-09-23 21:00:00;1 minute;3 round white lights in a triangle formation In September or November of 2007, I was driving home on a Sunday night.  The time was between 9pm and 10pm.  I saw three round white lights in the sky.  They were spaced evenly apart in the shape of an equilateral triangle.  They were not moving.  They were not very high above the treeline.  If they were connected to a craft, I could not see that craft.  All I saw were the round white lights.  They were not pulsating, just a steady bright glow.  After about a minute, those lights just disappeared.  I was staring right at them, and they did not move away or rise up....they just went out.  Gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));42.4422;-87.8395999999999
