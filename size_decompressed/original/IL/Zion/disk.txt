A bunch of lights with the silhouette of a saucer.;2016-02-11 19:00:00;Few seconds;A bunch of lights with the silhouette of a saucer. This sighting also occurred on 2/7/16 at around the same time, exact time not documented.  I looked up from my computer to look at the window that is above the kitchen sink facing towards the street and I saw a bunch of yellow lights.  I was curious at first, then I saw the outline of a saucer.  The object was moving slowly right, soon it would be out of my vision due to the window ending.   I scrambled to my feet to try to get a picture of it via my iPad, but it had moved on, trees blocking the shot.  I sat back down to tell those I know about it before it happened once more, about half an hour later.  I managed to get a picture in which it looked like a tiny blip, the neighbors' porch light taking the attention of the picture however, as the neighbors' lamp itself looked like a ball of light.  I told my mother about what I saw and she got up and opened the front door to look, and she said that she saw an outline of something over Lake Michigan.  I went back to what I was doing, until it happened again today, 2/11/16.   As of this moment, it has only happened once, and it was around the general time of the first sighting.  I was unable to get a good picture again, but I'm waiting for it to come by again like it did on the 7th. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
