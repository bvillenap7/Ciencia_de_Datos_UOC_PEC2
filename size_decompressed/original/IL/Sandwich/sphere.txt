Possible UFO Sighting in Sandwich, IL.;2010-06-28 23:00:00;1 Minute;Possible UFO Sighting in Sandwich, IL. Monday evening at around 11pm central time June 28th, 2010 my Mother and I were taking a refreshing night time swim in the pool.  We were staring up at the stars and discussing this and that as far as astrology and things of that nature when I noticed a ball of light moving across the sky.  I immediately told my Mom and pointed it out for her to locate as it continued across the night sky.  It looked very similar to a star but as it got to be directly over head it went from a star like glow to a much more intense brightness that I could almost characterize as gleaming.  As the object moved off in a North Western direction it's intesity lessened and then in a blink of an eye it just disappeared.  There were no beacon lights as if on airplanes blinking or otherwise.  There is no way this could have been mistaken for a regular commercial airliner.  I know this because we sat out for another hour after this sighting identifying actual airplanes and making sure they loo! ked nothing like what we had just witnessed. (10 Minutes before this sighting I witnessed something very similar and also pointed this out to my Mom but it was much dimmer and less noticable in the night sky.);41.6357;-88.6363
