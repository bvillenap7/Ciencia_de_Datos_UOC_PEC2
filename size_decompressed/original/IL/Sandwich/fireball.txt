12-14 Red-Orange orbs all following each other.;2011-08-05 20:53:00;4 min;12-14 Red-Orange orbs all following each other. I got out of my truck and saw two sets of 3 in formation and 6-8 individual red orange orbs take the same path from the north and turn to the west.  Some would speed up and slow back down.  Made no sound.  Like nothing I have ever seen before.   Made a short video from my phone.  It isn't very good and only about 11 seconds long.   All objects took the same path, as if they were following each other.;41.6357;-88.6363
