I couldn't believe what I was seeing..;2003-07-06 15:30:00;6 seconds;I couldn't believe what I was seeing.. We were in Morrison Illinois watching the Morrison Mud Racers, when I looked up and saw a disk-shaped very white saucer in the sky.  It seemed to appear out of nowhere....was moving slowly towards the right, then went down, then straight up. It took a second for me to try to figure out what it was.. well, it wasn't an airplane, or light...I could not believe what I was seeing.... I was telling everyone..LOOK - a UFO!!!!  Right at that time, it jetted, and was gone.;41.8149;-89.962
