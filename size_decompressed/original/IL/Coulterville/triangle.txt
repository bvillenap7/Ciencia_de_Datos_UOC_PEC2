Triangle craft landed on the ground.;2004-06-30 22:00:00;50 seconds;Triangle craft landed on the ground. This event happened several years ago. I was setting on the steps about 10pm(no moon only stars and a security lamp for light) and saw a triangular shaped craft float off the ground, and slowly move over my uncles house, west toward Coulterville Illinois.  The craft was landed on the ground at the location38'10'43.96”N  89'33'58.39”W(using Google Earth).  The object was not more than 300 feet from the house when landed, but I did not notice it until it floated off the ground. The object floated straight up about 150 feet and instantly stopped. It then instantly started moving west about 20 or 30 miles per hour. The object was completely silent, and had a dull yellow color. The lights were arranged 1,3,4,6 on the objects underside. The sides of the object were probably 40 feet long. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));38.1753;-89.6479
