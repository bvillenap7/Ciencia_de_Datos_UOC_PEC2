Guitar pick shaped aircraft hovering above trees.;2000-05-25 21:30:00;4 TO 7 min.;Guitar pick shaped aircraft hovering above trees. Driving East on rt.140 approaching Powder Mill rd. noticed what appeared to be three (3) bright lights straight ahead,slightly to the left. I noticed it appeared to be some kind of aircraft.I rolled down my window expecting to hear some kind of noise, and it was totally silent. It sat perfectly still. As I came to a stop at the lights at Stanley Rd., I could see three bright lights, one in each corner of what was a guitar pick shape.The lights were shining straight down. It also had one small blue light in between two of the white lights. As another car approached coming south on Stanley Rd. it slowly started to drift southeast.It got maybe a mile away,and took off so fast it was quickly out of my view.I tried to point it out to the car, but it took off so fast if they didn't look as soon as I pointed they did not see it. My 7 year old daughter was very scared,and crying hysterically because she had never seen anything like that before. It was definetly nothing I have ever    seen in my 30 years of life!;38.9107;-90.0793
