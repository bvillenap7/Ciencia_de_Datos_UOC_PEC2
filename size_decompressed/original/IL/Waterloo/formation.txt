Giant Chevron;1990-02-15 21:00:00;30 Min;Giant Chevron We saw a perfect Chevron formation,at a very high altitude. It was either 9 individual craft,or one giant ship.Huge. It moved from the south-southwest to the north-northeast in abruptly changing increments over the Mississippi River.There was no sound. The lights were blueish-white,and did not flash. We were 20 ish at the time,having a winter 4x4 off road jaunt. The skies were perfectly clear,these were not stars. I am now Communications Tech,My friend an Attorney.;38.3186;-90.1607
