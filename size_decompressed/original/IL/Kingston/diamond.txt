Bright unexplained light east of Kingston Illinois;2021-03-06 22:50:00;15 minutes;Bright unexplained light east of Kingston Illinois My boyfriend and I headed to bed around 10:50 pm he went to bed first I fed my son then was going into bed when I noticed out our window facing east a bright light that was changing colors it had to of been in Genoa Illinois. I sat there for a few minutes watching it unsure if it was a helicopter but it wasn't moving and it also wouldn't have been so bright so I told my boyfriend to look out the window to see he also was clueless in what we are seeing. A few more minutes go by and it just disappeared. Very strange this is the 2nd time I've seen this but the first time someone else seen it with me so this time im reporting it.;42.106;-88.7718
