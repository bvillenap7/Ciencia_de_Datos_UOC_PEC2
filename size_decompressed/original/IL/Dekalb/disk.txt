Picture taken with a cell phone while someone was on break at the DeKalb Forge Company.   I worked at the DeKalb Forge for about 3 years and lived in the neighborhood for about 15 years.  I climbed that water tower in the background of the photo when I was in my teens.   The person who took the picture didn't see the UFO when the picture was taken and later noticed it.   Feel free to post this picture.  I believe that the photo is most likely authentic, not photo shopped.   Sent from phone to phone to me.   Thanks. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the individual who submitted the report, and who forwarded the photos.  He sounded to us to be quite sincere about the event.  We have requested that the person who took the photo submit a report, as well.  PD));41.9014;-88.7514999999999
