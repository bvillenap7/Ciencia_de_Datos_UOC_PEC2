red light darting across the sky, oddly spaced;2003-12-05 16:50:00;3 seconds;red light darting across the sky, oddly spaced I saw a round, bright red light that resembled a reflector on a bicycle dart across the sky and fall below the horizon at an undeniably super power speed. This encouter took a couple of seconds to occur and gave me ample time to study the object and take note of the fact that it most definetly was not an air craft that is known to the general public. The object seemed to have take off from a standstill hover and jet down as if propelled not a falling or orbiting object of any kind.  I should also point out that we later saw a low flying plane and saw regular commercial planes for comparison later which solidified my belief ( or disbelief!) that what I saw was neither a plane nor a helicpoter. After seeing the bright red light, I looked into the sky and saw an alarming number of oddly placed lights in the sky. It was early dusk and there were not stars out yet. Also, I am familiar with the area in which this occured and have never seen these lights. Other people in this area have been seeing things lately and everyone here is talking about low flying planes. A lot more happened during this sighting that took place over 45 minutes, we even experienced slight time loss in that it took 55 minutes to drive 25 miles while we were driving at a constant rate of 6o mph. One last thing, we never heard any aircraft sounds at all.;41.9014;-88.7514999999999
