5 Hovering bright lights seen over Chicagoland;2018-02-10 17:50:00;30 minutes;5 Hovering bright lights seen over Chicagoland We were driving home and I turned to look to before turning right, when I first saw 8 bright lights.  Four of them went left and the lights went to a small twinkle.  Five bright lights remained and changed formation a bit but stayed mostly together.  It appeared to have flashing lights that moved in a circular motion.   This is the second time we have seen these lights.  Previous occasion, through binoculars, the craft appeared very large and in somewhat of a triangular shape.   They hovered for quite some time and moved in all directions with ease and great speed.   Helicopters were heard before lights were seen.;41.9014;-88.7514999999999
