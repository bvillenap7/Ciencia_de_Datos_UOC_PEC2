Large Cigar shaped object in Wheaton IL quickly disappears in the clear sky after cartwheeling north for a minute or two.;2009-08-27 11:00:00;2 minutes;Large Cigar shaped object in Wheaton IL quickly disappears in the clear sky after cartwheeling north for a minute or two. My husband and I were driving west on Geneva rd in Wheaton, IL right by the Jewel Osco, when we saw a bright silver, cigar shaped object in the sky.  It was clear out with very few clouds and the sun was shining.  I noticed the object and told my husband and we both watched it fly north and after a minute or so, it quickly diminished in size and then completely disappeared right in the middle of a clear blue sky.  It seemed to be lower than a plane would fly but still up high.  I'd say it was as long as a normal commercial plane, but 3 times the width.  It seemed to cartwheel as it flew north before it disappeared before our very eyes.;41.8563695652175;-88.1009478260869
