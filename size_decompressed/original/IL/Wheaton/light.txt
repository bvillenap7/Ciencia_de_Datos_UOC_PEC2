We saw a bright light, emitting two beams of light onto the ground.  The beams looked like search lights.  They seemed to be scanning or searching the ground in an open field near the Arboretum. We were on our way to a family members house, for our New Yearâ€™s Eve celebration, in Wheaton.  My driver had worked late. We were in a bit of a hurry to get to our family gathering. The evening was clear.  At that time there were no houses in the immediate area.  The light was not on top of a pole.  Could only see an orb of light, no body to it. I rolled down my window to listen for helicopter noise.  There was only a slight humming noise coming from the lighted object. When we saw it, my driver pulled onto the side of the road.  One vehicle ahead of us and several cars behind us also pulled onto the side of the road.  I wanted a better look. I asked my driver to back up.  When he declined, I began to exit the car. The driver took hold of my arm and demanded I not get out.  At that time the driver began to back up slowly. Immediately, in an instant, the beams of lights, scanning the ground, shut down.  The orb of light sharply shrank to nothing.  I listened for the humming noise.  No more humming noise. I have never seen anything like it since.;41.8563695652175;-88.1009478260869

No tail, did not radiate any additional light from its base,  lost sight in tree line to the west.  Was traveling with the horizion, NOT Falling out of the sky.  What could this have been???;41.8563695652175;-88.1009478260869
A green and red light warped through the sky faster than any modern aircraft and disappeared.;2014-10-25 22:30:00;1 second;A green and red light warped through the sky faster than any modern aircraft and disappeared. I had just gotten out of my car and was walking toward the front door of my house in Wheaton, IL, at around 10:30 PM when I looked south, up toward the sky, to suddenly see two lights zip across the sky faster than I have seen any craft fly in my life.  I believe this had to be only a single craft, because the two lights appeared to maintain the same distance from each other while flying through the air.  One light appeared to be red and the other green, just like a normal airplane would, but it covered a distance in what must have been less than a second that is physically impossible for any modern craft to travel.  It was there and then it was gone in an instant.  I could not decipher the physical shape of the craft because it was dark out and also because of the speed it moved at. I could see the lights traveling through the air however, and it looked like they left a streak behind them as it flew through the sky, but I think that had more to do with the fact ! that the lights were moving so fast.  When I looked over in the direction where I thought the craft had traveled (It seemed to be heading southwest), I saw a bright blue light that was flickering a little. I pulled up an application on my phone to see if it was perhaps a planet or star rather than any physical craft I might have seen. From what I could tell on my phone, it was just Neptune. The craft I had seen warp through the sky was nowhere to be found. It was just gone an instant after I had seen it streak through the sky at impossible speeds.;41.8563695652175;-88.1009478260869
Three orange light following each other, east to west.;2015-09-25 22:00:00;1 minute;three orange light foloowing each other, east to west watched airliner in the sky at about 10,000 ft (close to O'Hare) when I spotted a big red light beyond it.  I had an airplane in sight for reference and this was not an ordinary aircraft. It went approximately east to west, not too fast, gaining altitude until it disappeared in the clouds.  As soon as it disappeared, another orange light appeared, following the same flight path.  It was about 20 seconds behind the first one, way too close for a regular airliner distancing.   I ran inside to get my telescope pointer (magnification @20x) and looked at it through it. I did not see any body, just an orange light.  As soon as this one disappeared a third one showed up, following the same flight path.  Again, I looked at it through my telescope pointer and it did not look like an aircraft.  All I could see was orange light moving in the sky, east to west.  There was no other lights, or aircraft after this one.  Strange since we live so close to O'Hare.;41.8563695652175;-88.1009478260869
