white/silver circle at first stationary, then rising in altitude rapidly until no longer visible;2001-08-04 16:00:00;1-2 min.;white/silver circle at first stationary, then rising in altitude rapidly until no longer visible Standing in the backyard of my sister's home around 4 PM in the afternoon, playing with my 3 year old nephew with squirt guns, I happened to glance upwards and saw, at an altitude which I couldn't determine, though it seemed to be as high as a commercial jet, a round whitish-silvery circle, which looked about the size of a pin-head from where I stood, motionless in a clear blue sky. I watched it for about a minute, and then it seemed to shoot upwards at a rapid speed, which caught me off guard, causing me to sort of startle, until I could no longer see it. Since my little nephew continued running around and playing the whole time, which was less than a couple minutes entirely, he didn't see it, not that it would be unusual to him if he did at his age.;41.8563695652175;-88.1009478260869
2 White circles playing with each other;2005-07-15 15:00:00;10 Minutes;2 White circles playing with each other Alrighty, we were in my buddies back yard where we usually relax on summer nights, and it just so happened one of my friends and I were rocking on one of those rocking chair thingys. Well anyways, i looked towards the South in the sky, and saw 2, what i thought to be stars. Except they were bobbling way to much, and were far too close to be stars. The white circles spun in small circles while bobbling, and got real close to each toehr, almost touching, and then backing to their original position. I have no clue what this was, but it gave me goosebumps, and it was very strange. I continually look into the sky all the time now, for UFOs ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));41.8563695652175;-88.1009478260869
I saw about 20 circular lit-up objects flying in a row in the sky. ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-26 21:08:00;30 seconds;In my backyard and completely night/black out.  I saw about 20 circular lit-up objects flying in a row in the sky.  There was no sound.  They were flying slowly and then one by one their lights went out sequentially.  The lights were not multi-colored or blinking.  They were flying slowly.;41.8563695652175;-88.1009478260869
