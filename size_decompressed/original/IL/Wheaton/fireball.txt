I was watching television in my darkened living room, when I noticed a green comet-like fireball moving at a very fast and constant speed outside my window. The object was moving southeast to northwest (about 330 degrees to true north) and seemed oval in shape with a short, dark yellow tail. The entire object seemed to be on fire, changing light intensities like a flame. In about five seconds it disappeared in the trees on my northern horizon. There was no noise associated with its passage. I have never seen anything like it in over four decades on this planet! I suspect it may have been a meteor or large piece of space junk burning up in the atmosphere, or skipping off it. However, I am stunned that there has been NO media reports on this event since.;41.8563695652175;-88.1009478260869
