The strangest part about this was the fact that the toghether formed this---------------------->(  _  _  ),parallel line on a perfect diagonal. while they are in formation 30 seconds goes by and then these lines desintagrate back into orange lights and continue on their paths without colliding, though getting EXTREMELY close to hitting each other.  They clights continued to move along their streight coarses until both ran into a smaller cloud never to return to the still lit sunset sky.  not planes if you ask me.;41.8563695652175;-88.1009478260869
