strange sound;2001-02-09 03:00:00;90 sec. ??;strange sound I am an author/editor, and live in Wheaton, Illinois, about 30 miles west of Chicago. Around 3 this morning. I awoke to a sound unlike any I have heard before in my life--the only way I can describe it is to say, if you can imagine a gigantic, hi-tech helicopter that was the size of a battleship, that might give some idea. There had been a storm earlier in the night, but this certainly was not thunder--it was a steady but pulsing drone that was so loud and extended (and very mechanical sounding, VERY unlike thunder in that respect) I felt as though it must have spanned over a distance of five or ten miles. The entire house was mildly rattling at one point. So the next morning, I wondered whether I had simply hallucinated the entire thing, and asked someone who lives about a mile away if they heard anything last night, anything odd or different from normal. They said, As a matter of fact, around 3 in the morning, it sounded as though a gigantic helicopter was hovering right over my house. It woke me up. I regret not looking outside the window when it happened--have no idea why. I even wondered this morning if it was an earthquake of some sort, as I've heard there can be unusual sounds associated with those. By the way, I called the local police department last night and they heard nothing about this. I have seen military helicopters flying in formation over a nearby region (there are several airports around here), once during the night--but this really didn't sound quite like that (the thump-thump-thumps of your ordinary helicopter tend to be spaced closer together, stacatto-like) --plus, there was quite a fog around here most of the night, and I have a hard time imagining there were many flights in the air as a result--but I can't say for sure. If you happen to know of any sightings or other odd phenomena that were reported last night in the midwest, I sure would appreciate hearing about it/them. Thanks.;41.8563695652175;-88.1009478260869
Three white steady lights and a strange whirring noise.;2003-02-20 04:30:00;30 seconds;Three white steady lights and a strange whirring noise. Early morning, I am in the kitchen when I hear a strange whirring (not a helicopter sound) noise coming from outside. I looked out my livingroom window (facing north) and saw nothing until I looked up. I saw 3 bright steady (not flashing) white lights very low in the sky close to my house. It was dark and overcast but I got the impression I was looking at an airplane with a light at the direct underside tip of each wing and one light in the center of the craft. There were no other lights, flashing or colored which are on all the aircraft I have seen previous to this incident. The aircraft then rose quickly (and almost vertically) into the dark cloud cover. I am located close to DuPage Airport, O'Hare Airport, Midway Airport, Meigs Field, Argonne National Lab, and Fermilab. I notice all air traffic over my house and I have never seen or heard anything like I did that morning. I found this site after putting three+white+lights+airplane into a Google search. I'm not sure if what I saw was an UFO but whatever it was it wasn't the norm.;41.8563695652175;-88.1009478260869

I called FAA to see if they knew what it was, they transferred me to the Aurora, IL, tower. And they stated there was nothing on the radar.  And would be no VTOL's in the area.;41.8563695652175;-88.1009478260869
