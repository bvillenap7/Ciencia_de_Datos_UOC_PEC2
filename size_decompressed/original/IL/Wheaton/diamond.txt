Four lights hovering motionlessly in a near-perfect square formation.  No sound. Lights began to move overhead us and we could tell the looked like small blimps with fighter jet wings.  3 leave in a single line and the fourth moves to a new position and begins hovering again.  We could see it appeared to have clear panels on it which were leaking light.  It was hovering pretty low then we had to head home.   We captured crude video footage of the event.;41.8563695652175;-88.1009478260869
