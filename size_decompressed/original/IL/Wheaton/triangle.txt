We were driving east on Roosevelt Road and spotted a very bright white light that looked to be way off in the distance.   Within a minute we were along side the craft to the North of Roosevelt Rd.  Besides the very bright white lights we could now see a V or triangle shape.  There were two flashing white lights on either side with a couple red lights in the middle section.   The craft was heading west at either a vey slow speed or stopped.  It did not resemble a helicopter at all.;41.8563695652175;-88.1009478260869
It was fast and silent.;2016-07-27 23:00:00;1 second;It was fast and silent. I was standing next to my car looking up in the sky, and all of a sudden, a triangular shaped object passed by real fast and silent.  It had to be about 500 feet up in the air.  It had like green lights on its under belly that just floored me because it was going so fast and was so silent that you could hear a pin drop before you got a sound out of this craft.;41.8563695652175;-88.1009478260869
