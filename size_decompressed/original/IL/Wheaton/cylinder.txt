i dont know what i was seeing;2003-08-16 19:00:00;2min;i dont know what i was seeing i had no idea what this thing was.  It was flying at the speed a plane would, streight from left to right on the horizon-line/tree-line, and then just as it was about to escape from view it began moving downward.  This was either a ufo, or the biggest/low-flying plane I have ever seen(Im talking aircraftcarrier size).  My eyes could not see anything but a large GREY cylinder, and considering how long i watched it for, i would have thought I would see tailfins or and indication that it had wings, but i saw no such things.  I later realized that i heard no sound. Do you know of any huge low flying aircraft that is of a dark blue/grey color,specificaly civilian aircraft(would be most likely because i live near a small airport),?e-mail me. I am very curious and want to understand what i saw, because it seemed too HUGE, low-flying, and dark colored to be plane,(no wings or tail fin apparent unlike any other large plane i have ever seen during daylight hours). to measure what my eyes saw, it was no doubt quite far away(few miles), yet its thickness was about 1/2 to 3/4 cm, and one inch long.  I thought I was going to come home from my hike and hear about this, or atleast a terrorist attack or something.  I was definately weirded out. Also when it became dark out I saw lights in the sky, if they were planes, they turned off all their lights after changing direction or acting just as a plane would.;41.8563695652175;-88.1009478260869
