I thought I was looking at a bright star low on the eastern sky.  I got my binoculars out and looked at it.  I saw green light on outside edge of circle, reminds me of August birthstone color, there was a &lt in white lights protruding in from the right side about 1/4 into the circle.  It didn't move.  I watched for about five minutes then went to bed.  My husband said it was probably a satellite, my boss told me he didn't think so.  I have no clue as to what I saw.  It was far away in the sky.
