Fireball crafts being launched from a larger craft.;1999-08-31 22:45:00;30 minutes;Fireball crafts being launched from a larger craft. It was about 10:45 in the evening and we saw a fireball in the sky.  There were about 8 or 10 more of them in 5 minute intervals.  I believe that they were a craft being launched from a larger craft.  They were a sodium color and they resembled a roman candle firing off.  They came toward the ground vertically, dropped, and then took off horizontally.  Then, the fire burned out and they disappeared.;40.3003;-90.0659
