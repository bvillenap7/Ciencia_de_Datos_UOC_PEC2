Sighted high flying Cylinder UFO with split contrail.;2003-05-22 18:45:00;5 minutes;Sighted high flying Cylinder UFO with split contrail. On the way back from fishing at Washington County on Highway 64, I saw a cylinder UFO flying fast enough to leave a contrail. The time was about 6:45 PM. The contrail was split in two pieces so I thought it had to be a plane, but I could see no wings, tail or engine. It was quite long and appeared to be just under the high stratus clouds. It was silver in color and appeared to have structure, but I saw no markings. My wife was with me, but I did not point it out to her as it was straight up and would have interfered with her driving. We were approaching Oâ€™Fallon and were probably nearest to Lebanon. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke briefly with this witness, and we found him to be sincere and credible.  PD));38.6042;-89.801
