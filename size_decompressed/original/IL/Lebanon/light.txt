It is first visible from the Southwest looking from Lebanon and last visible in the Northeast over Vandalia from the same vantage point. ((NUFORC Note:  We have no idea what the witness has been viewing.  However, since the witness apparently has been in motion during his sighting, we feel that he may have been witnessing a (stationary) celestial body, which gives the impression that it is moving, given that the witness has been moving.
