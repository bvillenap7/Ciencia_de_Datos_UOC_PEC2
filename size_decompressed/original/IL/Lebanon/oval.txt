A Football Like shaped mothership seen east of Lebanon, Il;2013-09-11 12:26:00;10 seconds;A Football Like shaped mothership seen east of Lebanon, Il I was driving towards Lebanon from O'Fallon on US Highway 50 around 12:26 in the afternoon.  The sky was clear blue and about 30 degrees up from the horizon I saw a lil patch of dark smoke that expanded out of no where until it thinned out in the sky and thats when I saw this huge football like object.  At first I thought, how cool,  a Good Year Blimp, and then I realized it wasn't the letters GOODYEAR written on it but 2 rows of what appeared to be windows.  This thing was huge and in the distance because it blended in with the sky like how you would see the moon in the blue sky on a clear sunny day.  After about 10 seconds it faded into the blue of the sky as if a cloak was activated.   This wasn't over the city of Lebanon, it looked like it was way on the other side of the town in the country farm lands.  It was huge, slow and in the distance.;38.6042;-89.801
