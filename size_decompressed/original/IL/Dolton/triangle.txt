The object from my angle appeared like a pyramid shaped craft.  It appeared as if it was a stealth bomber.  I told my wife and daughter that it was a stealth bomber but to be honest once I looked at some of the pictures of a stealth bomber this craft was much bigger.  Also the bottom of it looke thicker since it flew right over us at a very low altitude.  It continued in an East direction and seemed to go further up as it continued in that direction.  I was not aware of any shows in the area, and most people in my area rarely pay attention to these things let alone reporting it.  I would not be surprised if I am the only one reporting this. Thanks for your time.;41.6267;-87.603
