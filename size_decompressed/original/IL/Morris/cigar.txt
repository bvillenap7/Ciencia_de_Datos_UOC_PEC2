If you have or do recieve any other reports fron the Chicago or south Chicago area on or about the above mentioned date, I would be curious to know.  I saw a highly reflective object high in the sky far south of Chicago.   For several minutes I just assumed that it was a plane until I realized that above me was another high flying plane leaving a vapor trail.  I would honestly write this off as just a misidentification except for the fact that for several months, my wife and I have been seeing black, dual rotor helicopters flying relatively low to the ground very fast from the south east to the north west, always in pairs and never with any markings.   These helicopters again appeared within 30 mins of seeing this object.  On a side note, I love listening to you on Coast to coast am and do appreciate the work that you do.
