strange light from sky came down in field then back up again.;1979-12-15 19:00:00;5 min;strange light from sky came down in field then back up again. my father and i was hunting with his dog in a corn feild on the edge of a timber line. i was watching a light in the sky, it was a different color whit and brighter than the other stars. as we was walking it made a move in a cork screw motion down toward the ground. i thought it was a air plane,then it stoped just of the ground with no noise of any kind. it was the size of a house and about 200 ft. from where we where standing. i still was waiting to hear a engine noise from a helocopter because it just stoped with out touching the ground. it stayed what seemed like 3 or 4 min. then went back up as fast as it came down . with the same cork screw motion and back to the same highth in the sky.it looked like any other star but the light was not the same. the light was so brite that it was brighter than the day lite and you could not make out any shape. till this day i still watch the night ski and can pick it out, it is best in the winter months. i have shown this to other people and they can belive what they see. if you steady your self aganist some thing you can see that it moves around in a small area with a bounce motion and from side to side. it has been a problem i wish i had an answer to, may be i could sleep better.

Red light circling over an area, then shooting off.;2003-07-10 22:00:00;15 sec;Red light circling over an area, then shooting off. I looked out the window of my room towards downtown Morris, There I saw a red light floating/flying above, or a little past downtown. It seemed to be circling over an area, and did that about 3 or 4 times, It then began moving at an incredible speed off in the distance and was quickly gaining altitude, I soon lost sight of it. there was nothing that I have ever seen, or heard of that could move as it did when it shot off.

Fast moving lights in trees.;2009-05-12 03:30:00;15 min.;Fast moving lights in trees. On 05/12/2009, at approximately 0330 hours, I was traveling east on Illinois RR. 6, 3 miles west of Morris Illinois.  At that time I observed what looked like a large white flood light in a tree line, 1 mile south of RR. 6.  The light was moving at too great of speed and changed direction to sharply to be a vehicle or poacher.  I stopped on RR.6 and watched the light for approximately 12-14 minutes.  The light then stopped and split into 2 different lights, 1 the same bright white, the other a blue green color.  The blue green light stayed ststionary while the white light continued traveling east in the tree line.  The lights were approximately 1 half mile apart when I heard what sounded like an electrical snap.  At that time the blue green light streatched from it's stationary spot to where the white light was.  The whith light then stopped and the blue green light re-appeared on top of the white light.  The lights then moved slowly to just above the tree line.  At that time I heard the electrical sound again, and the lights streatched to the west and dissapeared. I am not a person who beleives in this kind of stuff. I am a former Police Officer, and currently a armed nuclear officer. I thought I was initially looking at a poacher until I realized how fast the object was moving.;41.3693;-88.4179
I saw a strange, large ball of light outside my window.;2020-06-01 22:45:00;<3 minutes;I saw a strange, large ball of light outside my window. I was sitting on my couch and i looked right out the window and saw this very very bright beaming light in the sky and it was just glowing really bright and then it started to fade, all in the same spot.  And then the glowing bright light turned into red, green, and orange/yellow blinking lights and the craft moved toward Chicago.  I would have thought it was just a plane if i had not seen it glowing like it was before.;41.3693;-88.4179

They were traveling northeastward. Tried to make a video but they were to high and clarity was horrible from a cell phone.;41.3693;-88.4179
