As we got closer you could make out the shape of it.  The shape was a triangle and stood still in the sky.  It was only 100 feet up in the air so it was pretty clear.  The bottom of the craft was gray.  It was silent and make no noise.  As we pursued it it began to take off.  It had to be going atleast 200+ Mph.  We eventaually lost it after losing it in some trees.  About twenty minutes after posting this event on a social networking site I got a call from one of my other friends that described the craft to me before I even told him what I saw.  It was the same exact craft that we saw earlier.;41.3693;-88.4179
