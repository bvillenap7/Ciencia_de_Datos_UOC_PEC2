Formation of three lights in a vertical triangle hovered with no sound and vanished with no sound.;1992-07-19 00:34:00;5 minutes;Formation of three lights in a vertical triangle hovered with no sound and vanished with no sound. Got in my car and saw what I thought at first to be a helicopter hovering dangerously low. It was three lights which I figured was one on top and bottom of the passenger area and one on the tail. Didn't see any craft due to the distance in the dark--only the lights were visible. Realized my window was down and there was NO sound from the aircraft. Watched it for atleast five minutes, and it did not sway or rotate. Was interupted by the person's house I was leaving and when I looked back, it had vanished. I had not been drinking or anything else along those lines to impair my perception. I tried for the duration of the sighting to rationalize it out completely, and couldn't.;41.3693;-88.4179
Unexplained formation of red lights that slowly disappeared.;2012-10-21 00:05:00;4-5 minutes;unexplained &quotformation&quot of red lights that slowly dissapeared. Stepped outside for a smoke, looked Southwest from Morris Il, could not help but notice SEVERAL red lights in a tight formation, kind of oval in shape.   Red solid lights moving very slowly northbound, ran inside to get wife/kids/camera. as the formation passed behind treelines and rooflines, the number of visible lights reduced, from about 12 to 8 to 4 then to 1 then gone...;41.3693;-88.4179
