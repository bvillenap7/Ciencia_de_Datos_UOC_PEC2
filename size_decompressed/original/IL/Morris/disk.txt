Have photos, clear day!!!;2014-01-06 09:00:00;4 minutes;Have photos, clear day!!! January 6, 2014.  My son called and told me to check out the 3 suns.  I threw on a coat and slippers, grabbed my phone and headed out the garage door.  I looked out to the southeast to see the sun and its strange phenomenon of light display (I live in a rural area).  I started taking pictures, rapidly.  I couldn't really see because I was taking pics into the sun, so I just snapped, snapped, snapped.  It was like -43 degrees (wind chill) out that day, so I was out there for only a few minutes.  Went into the house, my grandson and I checked the pics out, then I went outside to take just a few more.  I did not see or hear the object, I just happen to take these photos.  If you zoom into the original, I swear there is many of the same object, just not right above my house.  The photos I have are incredibly cool.  The object is not there, there, not there.;41.3693;-88.4179
