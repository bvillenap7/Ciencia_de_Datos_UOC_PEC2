ufos over i80 between morris and bolingbrook illinois.;2013-10-25 20:00:00;30-40 minutes;ufos over i80 between morris and bolingbrook illinois. we were coming back from Chicago, headed west on i80.  After we got out of bolingbrook and drove for a bout fifteen minutes a huge triangle of three bright lights appeared in the sky.  we had no idea what they were and figured at one point they were silos, but we were being safe.  About twelve more minutes went by and we watched the triangle turn to a straight line.  As we kept driving about two min more goes by and these crafts are now by us coming from the south side of the interstate over and heading northeast.  They were going so very slow and they were extremely low to the ground everyone on the interstate slowed to about 49 mph and some were pulling over.  I opened my sunroof as one went right over us and i could not make out a silhouette.  It was the scariest thing I have ever seen and I still have no idea what it was.  There was a big line of huge bright white lights and orange and red lights around the rest of it. no noise or blinking of the lights.;41.3693;-88.4179
