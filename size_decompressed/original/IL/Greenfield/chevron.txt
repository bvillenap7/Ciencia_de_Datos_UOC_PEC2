the perfect V over illinois;2000-06-14 21:30:00;2 minutes;the perfect V over illinois at 930pm central time.. i walked outside and looked west at a 2 o'clock position in the sky. i noticed 8 or 9 brightly flashing lights in a V shape and moving in perfect formation and in unison. i immediately called a friend to look at this. we were on the phone while watching it.  the lights were not quite as big as venus appears. they lights were blinking randomly. the open part of the V was at least 5-6 full moons across. commercial aircraft would not have been in such a formation, and military aircraft one would have been able to hear. there was no sound. they moved east to west across the sky at what seemed to be a commercial aircraft pace. if it was multiple craft the formation was perfect. i watched them until they passed behind trees while my friends i was still on the phone with reported them for at least another five minutes,still moving west. my friends over the phone reported an obviously recognizable object of an airplane in the vicinity.  i do not know though if it was a single object or many.;39.3491;-90.2041
