Irregular shape with twinkling lights.;2000-06-14 19:30:00;15 min.;Irregular shape with twinkling lights. I walked to my backyard and in the sky to the west I saw what looked like a bunch of twinkling christmas lights in a sort of v pattern. The lights blinked one at a time in a racing pace. There was no pattern to the blinking. There was no sound from this object. After watching it for about 5 minutes I noticed an airplane coming past it from the south-there was no similarity. I watched it for about 15 minutes(until I could no longer see it). Actually, I couldn't really tell if it was a v. The lights were spaced in an irregular formation. I would say that the space between these lights were probably 1/3 of the size of the moon, and there were many lights. Since the pattern of the blinking was so irregular, it was hard for me to figure out the shape-I do know that it was not in the shape of an airplane, helicopter, or blimp. When I first noticed it I was approximately a half mile from it.;39.3491;-90.2041
