Stationary fireball lights on horizon facing Ohare.;2011-03-02 16:30:00;15-20 minutes;Stationary fireball lights on horizon facing Ohare. We were commenting on the strange cloud shape in the sky as though three jets went through close together and noticed them.  Looking northeast from our apartment balcony we saw three individual fireball pulsating objects.  They maintained vertical position  close to the horizon for over 10 minutes and then one went out slowly.  The other two remained for about another 5-8 minutes before going out as well.  They were almost amber in color but flickered frequently and were extremely bright. There were normal air traffic patterns with helicopters but this was extremely odd.  We have planes coming overhead all the time and this looked nothing like them whatsoever.;41.7888;-88.0916
2 red-orange balls of light in sky in Lisle, IL.;2015-06-19 22:30:00;21:31;2 red-orange balls of light in sky in Lisle, IL. I was in the passenger seat of my dad's truck, at around 10:30 pm, 06/19/15.  I was talking to my dad, and I saw 2 red orange lights above the tree horizon when I turned to look at him.  The lights where near his head from my point of view.  I was able to watch them for about a minute because I told him to stop a bit to see something.   They stayed there for a bit   but while I reached for my cellphone they disappeared.;41.7888;-88.0916
