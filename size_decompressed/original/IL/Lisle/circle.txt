It was approximately 4:50 pm CST on May 28, 2008 in Lisle, IL.  I was standing facing east (sun was behind me) walking home from a park with my baby and 3 neighborhood kids (range in age from 8 to 5).  The sky was perfectly blue- not a single cloud.  I looked at the sky and pointed and asked the kids “What’s that?”  One of the girls said it looks like the “Big Dipper” (only it had more “stars” in it).  I realized then that even though it looked like stars in the night sky they started shifting and moving around slightly, while still staying in the same area.  I knew that it wasn’t stars – they were UFO’s.   There was a main ship (white) that never really moved- it was the largest (comparable to seeing a planet in the night sky – maybe a little bigger).  There were multiple ships with this main one- they would disappear/vanish and then reappear.  They would change color- from white to red to green.  Mostly, the small ships looked like white dots – there were many of them.   At one point, I counted 8 – but, there were as many as 15+.   Airplanes passed the area (flying below the UFO’s) several times.  I KNOW these objects were not planes.  About 10 minutes went by and they were still in view I took 4 pictures with my Blackberry camera but nothing really turned out because they were so small.  As we began walking home, we looked up at the sky again- maybe a minute or two went by – and all the UFO’s were gone.  I checked several more times on our walk home and even later this evening and saw nothing.;41.7888;-88.0916

It made no noise, and was low in the sky.   We have never seen anything like this ever.;41.7888;-88.0916
