It was maybe around 10:30 pm.  My husband (noW ex-husband) and I had been working in Westmont. We were headed to his Uncle'S  house for a casual New Years Eve family gathering in Wheaton.  As we headed west on Warrenville Road we spotted a light suspended in the sky over the field next to the road.  It was a clear quiet night.  I begged my ex to pull over to the side of the road so we could get a better look at it.  There was nothing attached to the light...no tower beneath it nothing from which it was suspended.  Once we stopped (as did a couple cars in front of us and 1 behind us) the light started scanning the field beneath it (EDGE OF mORTON aRBORETUM). I rolled down my window to listen for some type of engine noise...thinking maybe it was attached to a small aircraft (thinking manmade)...I could only hear a PULSATING humming/vibrating noise similar the noise of power line towers.  As I reached for the door handle to get out of the car my ! ex grabbed my jacket sleeve and said, no! Don't get out! I pleaded with him to back up so maybe I could see it better...as he put the car in reverse and slowly startED back the object stopped scanning the ground and the light was immediately extinguished like a camera shutter closes. At that point my ex shifted into gear and sped away. My ex would never discuss what we saw admit to anyone what we witnessed and asked me not to, fearing people would think we were nuts. The event really upset him.HOWEVER, I have shared it with many people and I was very surprised to learn that there are tons of nuts on the loose. Well, at least I'm not alone! :) However, it would be nice to know who the others were in the cars that pulled off when we did. IT WAS VERY MUCH LIKE THE EXPERIENCE BELOW:   Occurred : 1/31/2008 06:30 (Entered as : 01/31/08 06:30) Reported: 1/31/2008 5:36:54 AM 05:36 Posted: 2/14/2008 Location: Lisle, IL Shape: Light Duration:10 Seconds A solid light that changed sizes instantly and then disappeared. It was approximately 0630 hours.  I was driving eastbound on I88 going through Lisle, Illinois on my was to work. Just to my slight right so probably a Southeastern direction I was this solid light.  The light looked as if it was many miles away and somewhat high in the sky.  It was round and was very white but looked filtered as if it was through clouds or fog around it, but there were no clouds at that time.  As I watched the light it suddenly became 4-10 times larger then its initial size in less then a second.  A few seconds later the light returned to its original size and as I was grabbing my video camera I looked up and it was gone.  This all took place over a period of about 10 seconds.  I am a firefighter and I have never seen anything close to this in my life. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.  PD));41.7888;-88.0916
