Line of 8 to 10 spheres, star sized lights traveling SW to NE across the horizon, perfect line.  ((Starlink satellites?));2019-12-22 18:32:00;8 minutes;Line of 8 to 10 spheres, star sized lights traveling southwest to northeast across the horizon, perfect line and distance between each My wife and I were out walking the dog tonight at 6:30 PM, 18:30 hours when we looked to the southwest, a line of lights weâ€™re moving in the sky, perfectly spaced distance between them, and going to the northeast. I have watched the International Space Station travel overhead many times which is approximately 250 miles above in orbit. Theses objects appeared much higher up, the same size as stars, traveling in a straight line, at least eight of them stretched halfway across the horizon and traveled perfectly spaced apart to the northeast. It was stunning to see these objects, they looked like a whole new constellation of perfectly aligned stars, only they were moving fast inline. The objects travel across the horizon for about 10 minuets, continuing northeast until we lost sight of them.;41.7888;-88.0916
