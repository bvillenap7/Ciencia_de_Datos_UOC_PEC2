Top Shaped Object Moves Back and Forth in Sky Over Parking Lot;2019-12-12 14:00:00;~5 minutes;Top Shaped Object Moves Back and Forth in Sky Over Parking Lot Walking from my car back to my office getting back from lunch, I heard and saw a flock of geese flying behind a couple of trees about 100 feet behind my office building landing near a pond near the trees.  It was a vivid blue sky and a bright sunny and very chilly day, and out of the corner of my eye noticed something above the tallest tree moving in the sky.  It was seemingly very high up, but looked like a toy top shape, like a wizzer from the 70s. It was silvery-white, and seemed to be slightly glowing, or hazy.  The thing shot forward very fast, then seemed to shoot back to where it had been very fast again, it did this three times.  After the third time it seemed to get a bit lower, more slowly, then I lost sight of it behind the building next to ours. I did set my lunch down quickly on the parking lot and tried to take several pics with my cellphone, but even though the object was right in the viewfinder, nothing showed up on any of the pics I took.;41.7888;-88.0916
