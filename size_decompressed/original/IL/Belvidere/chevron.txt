Weird shaped unidentified flying object in Belvidere Illinois;2011-10-07 20:30:00;5 minutes;Weird shaped unidentified flying object in Belvidere Illinois We were driving down Olson when I spotted something unusual in the sky. It didn't seem like it was really high up because it looked pretty big so I assumed it was close.  It was going in the direction that we were driving but it was ahead of us.   I ask the driver what he thought it was, he was paying more attention to the road so he took a quick glimpse and said it's a plane.  I was not convinced.  As we kept driving it stopped and stayed in one spot for a couple seconds and then we passed it.  It then turned around and went back to the direction that it came from.  That is when I saw it's shape more and I knew it was not an airplane.  I told the driver once again, look at that, that is not an airplane.   We were at the intersection so we made it to a stop sign and then he looked back.  He told me to try to get a picture.  It took me a couple tries until I could get a decent picture.  A lot of the pictures came out as a blur or lights.  But one of them were good enough to notice that it was no plane.;42.2571;-88.8535000000001
