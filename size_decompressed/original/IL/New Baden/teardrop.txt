Driving west on I-64  there was patchy fog to my left, and there was a bright light coming toward me.  Right in front of me, the light broke through the fog.  I saw an oval-shaped object which tear-dropped at the bottom.  It seemed to be flying about 1000 to 1500 feet above the ground.  About half way down the object, it started to turn greenish, and turned solid green towards the bottom.  It was travelling about 200 miles per hour, and the light stayed within the object (rather than shining outside the object).  When the object passed by suddenly, it looked like it was flying out of control, in a wave pattern, like a rock skipping across water (up/down/up/down), and then it vanished.;38.532;-89.6906
