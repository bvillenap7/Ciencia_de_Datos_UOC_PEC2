We even got the binoculars and watched what seemed to be blinking, but i'm sure it was the atmospheric distortion.  We even called our aunt who was in South Haven Michigan at the time as we share an interest in the cosmos.  She didn't see what we were describing.   AFter about 15 min, the objects seem to have went straight up and disappeared.;41.7687343750001;-88.4321406249999
White lights in the clouds over US Rt 30, three separate witnesses, no alternate explanation to be found.;2011-10-15 21:49:00;10 minutes;White lights in the clouds over US Rt 30, three separate witnesses, no alternate explanation to be found. My father (50) and I (21) were driving west on US Rt 30 approaching the town of Sugar Grove, IL, when I saw what at first appeared to be spotlights in the clouds.   It was around 9:49 pm, about 40 degrees Fahrenheit, mildly windy, and dark.  I pointed them out to my father, who confirmed that he saw them too.  We watched them closely for several minutes, and discovered that they were not moving in a linear or repetitive pattern like a spotlight should.  There were two, sometimes three, visible light sources.  No beams from the ground were visible, and we drove around for a long time looking for any possible source for the lights.  We discovered none, and continued on our way.   On the way home, we looked again for the lights, but they were no longer there.  The next day, I was having dinner with a friend of mine who lives in that area, and he mentioned something about seeing the same lights that we did, completely separate of our experience.  He described them in exactly the same way without me telling him what I had seen, down to the time, duration, number of lights, and location.   The lights were vaguely round or oval, and had a white, almost fluorescent color to them.;41.7687343750001;-88.4321406249999

It was 11:00 at night so it was very dark every where else but in this one area in the sky.;41.7687343750001;-88.4321406249999
