I was drive around to fill my time.  I drove to Suger Grove and was at the street to turn left (from Rt. 47 going south and Prairie)  Though the window (front window), I saw something that I don't understand but can tell you what it looked like.  As I drove south on Rt.47 to pairie, just before I was going to pull into the turn lane going to turn left, in a turn lane just for turning left.   Any way to get to the point I looked up going up hill, I saw on a very clear day a round object it looked about 500 to 800 ft. above the ground.  I could see very a clear round like a ball object.  It was not moving.  I could see ,in detail everything, it was like a ball in shape very shiney like a buffed air craft, very reflective.  I could see it in high definition.
