Several orange lights, initially looked like a falling star, but never changed.  Series of two to three at a time coming from South horizon moving slowly over toward the North.  Three alternated to form triangle, then one moved forward to go North, forming an elongated triangle while other two stayed side by side before lining up to move North.  They looked like they were coming from the airport, so I drove toward the airport and parked.  I didn't see anything looking South or overhead.  I then looked North and saw four orange orbs in the area where I saw the first orbs.;40.0667;-88.2528
