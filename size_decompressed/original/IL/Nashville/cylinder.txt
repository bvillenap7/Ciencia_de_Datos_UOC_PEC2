While night fishing at Washington Co. Lake, there was a very bright light in my SE.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus.  PD));2017-06-03 03:55:00;2 hours;While night fishing at Washington County Lake In a secluded spot, I looked up and there was a very bright light in my south east direction, behind trees,   At first, believed it was a star but upon further investigation object was moving up and down and sideways,  The light or object was not there prior to that time,  We began fishing at 1800 hours on 6/1/17.  It was very strange I felt like I was being observed,  It was not a plane,  It hovered behind trees for 2 hours,  It went above the trees on side tree.   I am really rather in shock.  The animals were all riled up,  Birds screeching, and all sorts of sounds coming from animals. ((NUFORC Note:  Venus.  PD));38.334;-89.3889
