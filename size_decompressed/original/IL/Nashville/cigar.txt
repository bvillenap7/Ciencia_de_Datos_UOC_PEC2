Cigar shaped UFO sighted while fishing.;2001-08-28 13:00:00;5 minutes;Cigar shaped UFO sighted while fishing. I was fishing on the lake on the Washington County Conservation Center near Nashville Illinois with a friend.    Some time in the early afternoon probably about 1:00 PM I heard what I thought was jet noise and looked up. There was a long narrow object silver in color with what appeared to be windows.  However there appeared to be no wings or tail.  I would describe this as a long cigar shape. It seemed longer than most jet liner fuselages.  I proceeded to rationalize this away thinking that I could just not see the wings. I thought that the lighting made them blend against the sky.  For that reason I did not tell my friend about it.  I looked at it for only a few minutes.  I since have thought about it and realized that I would have seen any wings.   The sun was high in the sky and I would have seen the shaded bottom of the wings not to mention the engines. Also there are two major airports near the area. So jet noise is common.  Background: I am 67 and retired. I spent most of my life in the retail business dealing with all kinds of people.  I was also a part time photographer and avid amateur photographer.  My hobbies also include art and bird watching.   I have three previous sightings but I don’t look for UFO’s.  I also have some other history, but don’t wish to discuss that here.  Note I wrote Filer on this also, but may have given the wrong date. ((NUFORC Note:  The witness apparently has had a number of sightings during his lifetime.   PD));38.334;-89.3889
