Motionless chrome sphere on windy day;2001-06-15 15:00:00;5-8 min;Motionless chrome sphere on windy day Im not too sure of the exact date, but it was in warm weather. I was on break(9-1-1 dispatcher) and it was quite breezy out, when I looked up between 2 trees and saw the chrome sphere motionless. It was at approx a 30 degree angle above, and it seemed to be quite aways away from me, until a Cessna 172 series aircraft flew past it on the opposite side of me. So, the object was smaller and closer than what I had first perceived it. I knew it had to be a UFO because it was motionless and the wind was 5-15 mph, shaking the trees pretty good! We have an airport near by, so seeing the aircraft was no surprise.;41.7517192913386;-88.1574413385826
Chrome Sphere motionless on a windy day;2001-06-15 17:15:00;<10 minutes;Chrome Sphere motionless on a windy day Chrome sphere sitting motionless on a windy day(17-ish mph). It was due east of my location, and for reference, a Cessna 172 flew behind it, which I guess the diameter of the sphere to be about 5 ft in diameter. The Cessna was 1+ miles from my location and sphere was maybe 1/2 of that. It sat motionless for some time, then a fellow co-worker came out, I asked him to look at it. He said he didnt see a sphere but did see a flash, and when I looked, it was gone. (I am not sure if I have reported this to this site before, but previously the site I submitted a report to then, when it happened, is no longer online:  http://www.ufosightingreports.com/year/2001/state/IL/june-2001-ufo-sighting-naperville-12006474;41.7517192913386;-88.1574413385826
Glowing orange sphere appearing near thunderstorm anvils;2006-04-14 19:15:00;60 seconds;Glowing orange sphere appearing near thunderstorm anvils I was taking pictures of a set of thunderstorm anvils, in the southern portion of the sky. There was an intense thunderstorm going on approximately 10 miles away, producing tornados, and the clouds were very eye catching. The clouds I estimate to be 75,000+ ft in height.    Upon walking back up to the house, I glanced in the west to take one last photo of more thunderstorm heads.   While getting ready to click the button to take the picture, out of nowhere instantly appeared, a semi bright glowing orange sphere, in direct sight, approximatley the same height as the thunderstorms peak clouds.   I successfully took two photographs of the object with a 3.2 megapixel sony cybershot digital camera.  It was only set at 640x480 at the time and the photos are full zoom(3x optical + 3x digital), But a picture is a picture high resolution or not.;41.7517192913386;-88.1574413385826
bulbous metallic craft at low altitude moving north to south at speed much faster than blimp.;2006-11-06 16:20:00;3 minutes;bulbous metallic craft at low altitude moving north to south at speed much faster than blimp. On either Nov.6th or 7th of 2006 while parked in Naperville, facing east (toward Chicago) I watched a bulbous silver craft (that I originally thought was a blimp) move from north to south at a speed that would be unattainable for a blimp. The craft was flying at a very low altitude.  I watched it move to the south until it went out of sight.   I placed a call to an off-duty policeman that I know to ask if anyone else saw it, or had reported it.  I probably was not taken seriously.   My father just sent me a copy of the UFO sighting at O'Hare on or around that date, as reported in the Chicago Tribune.  I couldn't believe the co-incidence since the craft I watched was moving from the direction of O'Hare to the south, and somewhat matched the description. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));41.7517192913386;-88.1574413385826
Bright orange sphere moving at an extremely fast speed, North-Eastern Illinois;2007-08-09 02:00:00;Less than 5 seconds;Bright orange sphere moving at an extremely fast speed, North-Eastern Illinois The incident occurred at night (around 2:00 a.m.) under a clear sky.  I was walking back from my car toward my girlfriendâ€™s house when I happened to look up.  As soon as I did, I witnessed a single bright orange ball moving extremely fast from west-to-east in a straight line, and the color did not appear to shift or become dimmer at any point.  By the time I came around to the front of the house and tried to get a better look, I could no longer see the orb.  The object was certainly not any sort of aircraft I have ever seen.  It appeared to be solid, and its height did not appear to fluctuate.  In other words, the motion was completely lateral--parallel to the surface of the Earth.  There was no tail, so I immediately ruled out the possibility of a meteor or comet, not to mention the fact that the object was certainly not falling.  If I were to wager a guess, I would say it was flying at an altitude of 1000-1500 feet.  From my view, it was roughly the size of my thumbnail, probably a little larger, which suggests to me that it was [naturally] a great deal larger.  The craft emitted no sound whatsoever, and there were no aircraft in the vicinity.;41.7517192913386;-88.1574413385826
Spherical object or ball of light flying low and fast while recording clouds;2010-08-11 18:45:00;3 seconds;Spherical object or ball of light flying low and fast while recording clouds August 11th, 2010. Sony DCR-TRV140 Digital8 tape  Camcorder with 20x optical  f=3.6-72mm zoomlens Naperville, IL  approximatley 6:45pm Clear Blue sky. perfect, small breeze. 90 degrees faranheit. There is a chair in the front of my garage, I use the armrest of this chair to mount my camera, and record the clouds in the sky 1 hour at a time, to timelapse animation process them through my computer using windows movie maker in windowsXP. My camera  was screw mounted on this chair, pointed dead east, in the exact oppisite direction of the sun, its angle was adjusted to about 55 degrees to get a view of the first batch of clouds I saw.  I then zoomed the camera in to 5x optical, and clicked record, I then left it alone so I could do other things. After observeing the sun with my telescope for 50 minutes, I came back to  the camera, clicked the stop button, picked up the camera, retrieved my telescope, then went in the house to process the video with windows movie maker. While playing back the video, approximatley 15 minutes into it, after the first cloud passes, what appears to be a white ball of light,  traveling incredibly fast, and seemingly low, zips into view coming from the west, and exits the frame into the eastern horizon toward  the direction of Chicago. The camera audio pickup was set on high, and no sounds are heard.  This video was captured on digital 8mm tape.  I did not physically witness this event, only the camera did.;41.7517192913386;-88.1574413385826
