2 jetliners 1 glowing  white Triangle ufo, intersecting flight paths Triple Near miss Clear Day .;2003-07-22 17:30:00;1 minute;2 jetliners 1 glowing  white Triangle ufo, intersecting flight paths Triple Near miss Clear Day . It was about 6:30pm central, not sure on the exact time, give or take an hour, no more. I was out side on our brick deck, grilling, when I heard a loud rumbling jet in the sky, curious I wandered in the grass to get a look. It was a regular airliner jet, blue in color with silver or gray wings, fairly low in the sky, about 15,000 feet? Flying an east to west flight path. Moments later, another passenger jetliner, red with white wings, intersected the path of the first jet but at a lower altitude of 9,000 feet, at a South to North Path. I was fascinated they did not hit each other, it could be considered a near miss. Suddenly after the two jets safely started making their way from what appeared to be  over lapping each other,  I saw a glowing white outline of a sharp peaked triangle fly inbetween these two jetliners with a slightly Northwest to Southeast flight path Going the same speed as the 2 jets.  The bottom portion of the triangle did not appear to be there, there wasnt an outline like the two sides, which formed directly into the steep nose to the craft as if it did not need wings,  and the middle of the triangle appeared to just be plain blue sky. The glow of the outline did not appear to be a form of light, just a hazey opaque white that gave the illusion it was glowing. Kind of what a piece of frosted glass looks like,  If I were to estimate, it would be a 30-40 degree angle in the triangles shape makeup.  It was not cloudy in the portion of the sky, directly above my head where all the sightings took place. Altough there were High, white puffy storm clouds on the eastern horizon. Not at all distorting any view of the events. I instinctively ran in the house to grab a camera after an adrenaline rush from fascination, and came out to be disappointed with awe, as I could not find the flying white triangle any more.  The 2 pilots of the jetliners HAD to have seen this craft, Visually, AND on radar. So I am counting them as witnesses. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the white, triangular object might have been a delta-winged, turboprop pusher, e.g. a LearStar, or a similar aircraft with swept wings.  Just a guess.  It is very difficult for an observer on the ground to determine an accurate range to a object of even known size.  PD));41.7517192913386;-88.1574413385826
Bubbling clouds, black triangle ufo, possible cloud manipulation.;2004-07-13 14:16:00;15 minutes;Bubbling clouds, black triangle ufo, possible cloud manipulation. it was a dull day, eeriely calm with no wind , nor calling from birds. they clouds are what drew our attention outside, which, looked like nothing ive ever seen before, bubbles , erupting downward like spheres, followed by uprising lines that resembeled a fire shortly later.  We did not see this ufo with our eyes, because we were focusing on the clouds. I was taking pictures of the clouds, and as i went over them , i noticed a strange silloette of a black triangle, and thought to report it here.  I know its not dust or nicks on the lens, for it was extremely humid that day, and as i walked out of the house with my camera, the lens fogged up, twice. I thenfor cleaned the lens outdoors looking at the clouds, twice.;41.7517192913386;-88.1574413385826
Large flying triange with Squared off tips made humming noise in the clear early morning sky.;2008-07-23 09:20:00;60 seconds;Large flying triange with Squared off tips made humming noise in the clear early morning sky. I was in the bathroom at 9:30 this morning for my early routine, and all of a sudden there was a real low pitched humming noise, uncomparable to other sound(very unique).  It wasnt very loud at first, but it got closer and closer and closer , while it got closer it got louder and louder, next thing i knew everything in my bathroom started shaking as the craft sounded directly above my house.  I knew this wasnt an airplane , jet , or a helicopter, so i ran outside as fast as i could. Behold with disbelief, and flying north, at what appeared to be slower than a jet, was a large flying triangle, it was solid grey in color and really smooth looking in appearance. The nose of the craft, and both wing tips were squared off and not pointed.  There were no lights or marking's on it what so ever, not a cloud in the sky, and as sunny as a 9am morning could get.  I live in a extremely high air traffic area, i can immediatley distinguish all aircraft noises from in my house after 20 years of living here.  All jets, cessna's, private jets, and helicopters can be heard 1 mile before they get to my house. I avidly take part in watching aircraft over my house due to the many close calls of two jets crossing the same path.;41.7517192913386;-88.1574413385826
Naperville IL Triangle shaped UFO , video evidence.;2013-09-12 18:30:00;1 minute;Naperville IL Triangle shaped UFO , video evidence. My friend sent me a picture of a black hawk helicopter at 6:20 pm and told me it was headed my direction.   I ran outside with my camera so I could snap a photo of it, and instead I saw the most massive triangle shaped UFO instead.    The black hawk was flying East, toward chicago, and UFO flying southwest.    There was a passenger jet in viewing distance of this flying object. Guaranteed to be on radar.  AND I GOT IT ON VIDEO. http://youtu.be/B6mU38PbHF8;41.7517192913386;-88.1574413385826
