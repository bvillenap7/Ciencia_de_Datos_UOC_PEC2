While driving west, sun beginning to set and very clear skies, I viewed along with usual planes in areas, a vertical cigar shaped very very bright object in the sky, far west and up from Naperville,Illinois...each time I was able to stop, I had placed it going due west so that I could tell if there was any movement, turning, change of pattern or changing to horizontal position...none of these happened. I made one jogging turn, and in possibly less than l/4 of a minute, the object was completely out of the sky in any of that area. The sky again, had no cloud formations, was clear blue, and bright sun...there was no where it could have flown to that quickly...what struck me was how bright it was, and the vertical shape, and fact that Im certain, it hovered, and did not fly....;41.7517192913386;-88.1574413385826
