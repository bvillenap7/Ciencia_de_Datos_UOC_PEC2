We viewed these orange fiery orbs traveling on the same southwest heading from the northeast. They were traveling at a high rate of speed on the same, straight vector. They passed, from our persective, directly over the Bolingbrook, IL fireworks Fourth of July fireworks show as it performed, so thousands must have seen them. The orbs were at full brightness, magnitude ten. The light was constant until it passed far down range and then it instantly extinguished. I have looked at every single aircraft I see in the sky, night and day, for twenty years and I’ve never seen anything like this. I also am an amateur stargazer, and have watched satellites and iridium flares for years. This was not like any of those. It appeared to be in orbit, but was generating its own light. There were no other observable lights, just one big fireball. It made no audible sound. I’ll be filing a separate report on  our seeing one identical object on 07/07/2012 at approximately the same time on the same vector.;41.7517192913386;-88.1574413385826
