1 bright af middle white disc which had two pinkish or reddish bullet shaped objects 1 above the white disc and 1 below the white disc;2017-07-20 18:30:00;20;1 bright af middle white disc which had two pinkish or reddish bullet shaped objects, 1 above the white disc, and 1 below the white disc, seen for the length of my drive home from work with a friend.  It just hovered there, and it was large af and I am so surprised I didn't see or read up that anyone else in Naperville saw it!  It seemed to be directly above the area of I-88 and route 59!  If anyone else saw this please add to site. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date above is approximate.  PD));41.7517192913386;-88.1574413385826
