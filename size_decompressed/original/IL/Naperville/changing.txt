Clear sky, Highly reflective Round Object leaking fluid or vapor.;2011-05-04 17:30:00;10 minutes;Clear sky, Highly reflective Round Object leaking fluid or vapor. Perfect day with no clouds, sunny blue sky , 65-70 degrees warm.  May 5th 2011 5:30pm  I was outside putting a brick walkpath in the front of my parents house, and I heard a very strange airplane flying, I looked up and there was a japanese zero (had the rising sun symbol on both wings) flying directly above my house. While looking at this plane, I noticed a strange white or silver object in the sky alot higher, and behind the plane.  The object looked like it was leaking water. I raced in the house to get my camera (sony dcr-trv140 digital 8mm) and my mom. I turned on the camera and focused on the object.  It appeared to be reflecting sunlight very well indicating it was very reflective.  It was possibly round or sphere shaped and possibly spinning, but I cannot confirm this because the sunlight made it look like it was changing shape. I was zoomed in on the object to 20x optical, and could clearly see what appeared to be a vapor, or steam, or something leaking out of the bottom of it. The only thing I could imagine it being is a weather balloon, and the leaking portion just an illusion, quite possibly a long tether?  I recorded as much of the event as I could but my lens fogged up badly due to my sweating face, and could no longer see the object with my eyes.  I have about 5 minutes of high frame rate video of the object, in digital 8mm format.;41.7517192913386;-88.1574413385826
