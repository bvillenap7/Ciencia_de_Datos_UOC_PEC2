I leaned forward and saw that this object was being followed by 6 round small objects- 5 below it and one above it to the left.  I have never seen anything like it before.  They appeared to be silver metal looking objects and were fairly high up.;41.7517192913386;-88.1574413385826
Golden Circular vehicles seen in Naperville.;2016-06-06 23:00:00;5 minutes;Golden Circular vehicles seen in Naperville. Saw 6 golden circular vehicles forming a large circle.  I saw one more golden circular vehicle moving quickly toward the circle and flew through) it, and then all the golden circular vehicles continued to move along the sky.   No noise was heard and definitely not an airplaine or helpicopter.  Never saw anything like this ever before in my life.;41.7517192913386;-88.1574413385826

Spotted six, meteor-like objects in strange flight pattern half hour after sundown around the moon.;2020-05-02 20:30:00;7 minutes;Spotted six, meteor-like objects in strange flight pattern half hour after sundown around the moon. My daughter and I were star gazing and hoping to catch a meteor.  Thirty minutes past sundown, my daughter catches a glimpse of what looks to be a possible meteor.  We noticed five other lights hovering between the moon and Earth almost surrounding the moon and dancing around it like electrons around an atom. We were excited and amazed then scared.  They continued to make strange flight patterns moving diagonally like the path electrons take.  Suddenly, a very bright, white cloud started to cover the moon and part of the sky blocking our vision of a continued dance or flight pattern. The clouds continued to roll in and we no longer saw the lights.  Only the moon on one side, Sirius on the other, and the Big Dipper.;41.7517192913386;-88.1574413385826
