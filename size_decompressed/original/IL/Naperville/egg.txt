Sighting of inverted egg or tear drop object;2007-05-18 09:45:00;2 min;Sighting of inverted egg or tear drop object Description: The object was an inverted (small end down) egg or tear drop shaped structure. Dark grey not black and was clearly reflective (eastern side appeared glossy as a consequence of sun). The color was reminiscent to that of a gun metal grey. Approximate altitude was 2000 ft. and as a guess Â½ mile south of 75th street and appeared stationary over the course of the observation. Clearly not a balloon. Another vehicle next to me with two men were looking at it as well. The car behind me tooted its horn as a consequence of both my and the other vehicle not moving when the light changed. Upon looking up to the light and in the rear view mirror at the tooting car (app 3 sec) the object vanished. The vehicle next to me must have noticed its disappearance as well because the driver lifted his hands and shrugged his shoulders.;41.7517192913386;-88.1574413385826
