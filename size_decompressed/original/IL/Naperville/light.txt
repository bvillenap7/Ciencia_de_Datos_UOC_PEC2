I was lying in my bed about 2 in tha mourning when I just happen to look out in the window and in the distance I saw what appeared to be a UFO as I looked closer thats what it had to have been. It waz a bunch of lights floating in mid-air. I knew it wasnt a helicopter because it wasnt making any noise. I stared at the object for about 15 min and then i looked away for a little while. I then looked back the object was still there as I contunied to watch all the lights go out into a very smaller light and it just flew off into space. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Intense display of stationary light in 3 phases of color shifting;2001-09-06 21:00:00;30 seconds;Intense display of stationary light in 3 phases of color shifting During a thunderstorm with intense lightning, looking in the southern sky over the naperville police station i witnessed a strange object stationary in the dark sky. Very noticible and very intense, it was a growing pulse of white light, that after about 9 seconds shaded to a bright sea green flaring into a dark blue eerie glow about 20 seconds later, the event ended with a shimmering type display, of dark blue light vanishing without a trace. I at first thought it was a meteor, but this object was not moving and i have never witnessed a blue colored meteor. Id estimate the magnitude of the display of light to be about a 2 or 3, very bright. Unfortunatley i failed to have my camera :( ((name deleted));41.7517192913386;-88.1574413385826

5 bright orange glowing lights traveling over Naperville Illinois;2010-07-17 22:00:00;5 minutes;5 bright orange glowing lights traveling over Naperville Illinois We saw 5 bright orange lights the lights did not blink or flicker, but were bright and steady. They descended from high in the sky, following each other in a row. They did not make any noise at all, and did not move like airplanes. There flight was very smooth, almost as if they were floating. They preceeded towards us and became brighter. People in their cars stopped to observe the phenomenon backing up traffic in a very busy intersection. Two of the balls of light appeared to get close together, almost as if to touch, but then split apart quickly and went opposite directions and faded away. One remained bright, and quickly darted westward away from the others. The two others disappeared from site.  A small plane heading west was in the sky at the same time and appeared obviously different from the others.  I tried to use my cellphone to make a call and it wouldn't work.  I continued to press the buttons but they wouldn't function.  About three minutes after t! he event ended, my phone began to work again.;41.7517192913386;-88.1574413385826
Round object appears to have returned over my house;2010-09-04 16:00:00;90 seconds;Round object appears to have returned over my house September 4th 2010 4:15pm  Sunny day, Blue sky, sporatic cirrus clouds, high 60s degrees faranheit , cool and breezy. Sony DCRTRV140 dv8 camcorder f=3.6-72mm 1:1.14 37mm lens  20x optical zoom max. At about 4 pm today, I decided to cut the grasss.  While on the tractor at about 415pm now, I saw a strange white glow or round object slowly flying south and extremely low over my neighbors house, I could not stop staring at it. I didnt have my camera at that time. I watched the object for about 12 seconds while on the tractor until it appeared to get lower, and disappear from my sight behind fairly distant trees.  I then continued on to cut the grass, and approximatley 2 minutes later I saw the thing again, this time time it was now really high in the air, and flying just as slow, directly over my house, going west this time. I immediatley shut off the tractor and ran to get my camera as fast as I humanly could, and when I returned outside, I successfully captured the object on video for 1 minute before I could no longer see it on my viewfinder, and now im submitting the video to you.;41.7517192913386;-88.1574413385826

Two formations looked like triangles and the third was like the little dipper then they all scattered to the north.  Then we stopped Att wife's work to get people to come out and see them before they got to far.  Then there was a single light that came from the east then caught up with the rest of them then they were all gone.

Multiple orb shaped lights in the sky traveling over Naperville.;2012-09-15 21:05:00;21:30;Multiple orb shaped lights in the sky traveling over Naperville. I saw a series of lights in the sky why entering my neighborhood.  I stopped and watch ed these lights change directing and altitude.  Some were traveling very close to each other. I am a pilot so noting that could be a fixed wing aircraft, only possibly a helicopter but no noise.  I called 911 and told them.  Went home parked my car and decided to walk around to see if any more lights appreared.  Unbelievably they did, I ran to my neighbors house so I would have a witness.;41.7517192913386;-88.1574413385826
Light above Naperville.;2014-12-01 23:35:00;~10 minutes;Light above Naperville 	On December 1, 2014, at approximately 11:35 p.m., over Naperville, Il 60540.  It was located in the eastern sky slightly above Jupiter’s position.   My husband and I witnessed an extremely bright, white, blinking light that was far brighter than anything else in the sky.  The object was stationary, and occasionally a second light would appear in close proximity to the first light and then disappear.  The object was bright enough that it illuminated all the cloud cover.   We used the Google Sky application, thinking it could be Jupiter and found that Jupiter was below.   We were able to identify everything else Google Sky was showing us and this object was not among any identified objects.   We continued to watch the object for ten minutes and then went back inside.;41.7517192913386;-88.1574413385826
Mysterious single light south of N'ville zipping very fast up, down, sideways, angling upwards, then downwards blinking at times.;2015-09-27 21:08:00;4 minutes;Mysterious single light south of N'ville zipping very fast up, down, sideways, angling upwards, then downwards blinking at times. While watching the lunar eclipse tonight around 9 pm, viewing towards the east and south, we witnessed a single light hovering, then rising sharply straight up, then falling sharply straight down, then zipping sharply and very fast to the left, up down, right, left, sideways, angled upwards then angled downwards, in a completely random pattern.  It was blinking on and off, also randomly, throughout the 4 minute period we stood watching this. It was far in the distance, to the east and south of where we were standing. It was approximately 20 degrees above the horizon?  It appeared way off in the distance, like perhaps 15 miles from where we were, although I could not judge this for certain.  I say these numbers because other planes were in the sky (further away) and were fainter and smaller lights and moving at a steady rate across the sky - not so this light.  It was brighter (so closer? or bigger?) than a plane 20+ miles away.  It could not have been a plane - planes do not move that fast nor rise and fall like that (straight up, then down). It could not have been a drone - I doubt I could have seen a drone move that fast and in such a peculiar pattern either. It could not have been a helicopter - again, no helicopter could have moved that fast, nor traveled sideways or angled upwards like that. It was not a search light - this was a single light, not a beam of light. The light was white or bluish white. It looked like a firework, but with no trail/tail and no visible trajectory path - just a light zipping around. Besides, a firework burns out - this light stayed lit and then would blink out, then return in a different location with the same intensity and size/shape.;41.7517192913386;-88.1574413385826
Strange blinking red light, along with a green object.;2017-12-10 17:50:00;5-10 minutes;Strange Blinking Red Light Along With A Green Object. First observed from the downtown Naperville area, a small red light that appeared stationary above a Walgreen's located at the intersection across from the parking garage where my car was parked for the evening.  It was about 5:50 P.M. on a clear evening no stars were out yet and no planes or other aircraft were observed for the evening.   The light was clearly artificial, but there hadn't been any typical air traffic the light was out of place.  I was across the street from the Walgreen's, waiting for the traffic light to change so that I could get to my car in the parking garage, observing.  It wasn't moving when I first observed it, yet the light was blinking to no apparent rhythm: sometimes it would blink rapidly, other times it blink once, then stop blinking for several seconds before starting again.  It would flash red, then appear to vanish, only to blink red again.  I was curious, and flashed the flashlight on my phone at it, mimicking its own flashing.  It flashed back, and then stopped flashing for an extended period of time.  When the light finally turned (after I took a quick series of photos) I crossed the street and headed the down the block towards the garage.  However, I noticed something odd the red light wasn't behind me as it should have been if it was still stationary.  If it had just been hovering I should have passed it by, leaving it behind me. I should have had to look behind me in order to keep it in view, not in front.  Curious, I stopped walking abruptly.  In that short instance of my pause, I caught it moving a few degrees more to the west before it stopped.  I took more photos and kept walking. In front of the garage, across from the municipal center, there is a relatively empty, small parking lot.  I stopped there and flashed my flashlight once more in a series of rapid bursts at the light there was no response this time.  Once more the light was stationary.  I took the stairs up to the fourth floor (where my car was), and looked out the gaps between the floors.  The light was still there, stationary, blinking slowly. I took another series of quick photos. Leaving the downtown area to get home,  I hoped out loud that I wouldn't see it coming after the car. I don't recall seeing it after I left.  I don't know if it was still there when i pulled out of the garage, but I know for sure that it didn't follow me back to my house.  I’ve seen a lot of air traffic in my neighborhood, but I have never seen anything like it.  This light was way too high in the sky to be a plane or a helicopter, not to mention that I’ve never seen one act or move like this light did. Later discovering a video I took with my phone that I hadn't noticed before, I saw another object come out of nowhere during the last two seconds of the video.  Green, and flying out of nowhere exactly that I pinpoint, it was much larger than the red light, didn't blink, and wasn't noticed while I filmed.  I don’t recall seeing that object/light before the viewing the video.  Zooming into the photo shows a weird green shape.;41.7517192913386;-88.1574413385826

They were very distant and not spaced out evenly there were some singularly spaced some in pairs some in threes.  But all flying in a straight line one after another across the sky.

Stationary light fades from view;2020-11-20 03:30:00;3 minutes;Stationary light fades from view At approx. 0330, I stepped outside to take a look at the sky.  Looking to the north, I noticed an extra star in the bowl of the Little Dipper, between the stars Kochab and Pherkad.  I estimated the brightness to be about second magnitude.  Being not quite fully awake, my first thought was, That planet is out of place.  After a moment, I realized what I was thinking, came fully awake, and started watching the light.  After approx. two minutes, the light simply faded out over a period of about three seconds.  I've observed probably hundreds of satellites and the ISS over many years and the thing that strikes me was the total lack of motion against the fixed stars before it faded out.  I suppose though that might have been a projection effect.  I noticed no aircraft in the area, shy was clear, and wind was calm.  Heavens Above site showed a pass of US3A07 but the timing was somewhat off and there was no track, contrary to that predicted on HA.;41.7517192913386;-88.1574413385826
