While photographing Venus, Aldebaran, Pleiades and Hyades this morning an airplane passed over.  I saved at copy of the image at: https://bit.ly/_interesting_image_200703   Later when I looked at the image I saw a shape that I did not recognize. The object is to the left of the Pleiades, at the top left of this image.  In this image the object is largest with the best focus. The craft left a trail and it (the trail) appears to be like that of an airplane in later images. The object passed Venus and went into toward the horizon. The object and trail are a sequence of images that last over 3 minutes.;41.7517192913386;-88.1574413385826
