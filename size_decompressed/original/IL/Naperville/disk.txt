As I turned my head to the left as I was preparing to lay down, I saw a red circle in the shape of a circle and pulsating, about the shape of a dime, located right above the edge of the woodwork on the window on the right.  I just stared and watched it pulsate.  And then the red circle disappeared and re-appeared on the opposite side, on the bottom of the window itself, and I thought to myself, something is moving from right to left and is probing this room from the outside.  I heard nothing from the open window, and then realized I had to look behind the window shade to see what/if something was out there.  I looked behind the window shade to the to the right and saw nothing.  The sky was hazy and had thin, long whittish clouds, like the kind you see in the winter and the area was partially lit by street lights.  I then looked to the left behind the window shade and saw a saucer shaped ufo moving up very slowly in a circular, loopy motion, at a 90 degree angle to the left.  I saw only the bottom of the saucer because the top was behind the thin, white cloud. The entire bottom of the ship was pulsating a white light, dim and then bright, dim and bright.   It kept moving in a circular, very slow,  loopy motion and then it cleared the cloud and I saw the whole ship.  It was a silvery color and saucer-shaped and continung to ascend in a circular, loopy manner, at an extreme left angle.  I got nervous and couldn't look at it any longer.  I ran downstairs to take a look from the first floor of the house, but could't see that area that I had seen upstairs.  I ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));41.7517192913386;-88.1574413385826
