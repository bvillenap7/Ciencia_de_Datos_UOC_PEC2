4 bright orbs in loose triangle over Oswego, IL, planets or hovering craft?;2013-10-13 19:30:00;10 minutes;4 bright orbs in loose triangle over Oswego, IL, planets or hovering craft? I will keep it short and sweet.  I was driving home when I noticed what I thought must be the planets aligning.  Four lights in the sky that for all intents and purposes looked like stars, only their size and brightness was highly unusual.  Visual, they were the size of small basketballs as seen by the naked eye.  I'm no astronomer, but I don't think 4 planets are that visibly big and so close to each other in the sky.  It seems like there'd be an announcement of the event, anyways.  The lights were arranged almost like an upside-down Big Dipper, or a triangle composed of four lights.  What really convinced me that this was some special type of craft was the fact that when I stopped moving, I noticed that the lights did not move at all.   Shortly after they dissipated.   There were many planes in the sky for reference to the size of these objects as well, and they were like flies compared to birds.  I wonder if anyone saw this as well?  It was amazingly bright ! and I couldn't help but have my attention snared.   Sorry, no pictures.  By the time I got my tablet out from the house, the scene vanished.;41.6837;-88.3499000000001
Orange fiery spree threw the night sky!  ((anonymous report));2016-07-04 22:00:00;90 seconds;Orange fiery spree threw the night sky! I had seen an orange sphere traveling east towards Chicago.  The UFO was flickering, and had almost appeared to be on fire.  Went either threw or above a cloud but was still visible.  Exited the cloud and as it was about to enter another cloud it has slowly faded away.  But never had exited the other cloud.  The UFO had appeared to be traveling at the speed of a commercial aircraft. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
