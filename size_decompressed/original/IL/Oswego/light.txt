Three red lights equally spaced one on top of another in Eastern Sky;2004-11-08 21:30:00;2 hours;Three red lights equally spaced one on top of another in Eastern Sky I was outside looking for the Northern lights that evening. I decided to do a little sky gazing while out there.  I located the galaxy andromeda in the northeastern sky quite a bit east/south east of this galaxy I saw three redish glowing lights.  They were one on top of another, spaced incredibly equally apart.  I remember thinking how odd it was how exactly perfectly spaced they were.  I did see five aircrafts, not circling them, but flying in between them.  The sky was perfectly clear that evening, about after an hour of them not moving. I went inside.  I periodically went back outside every twenty minutes or so, until 23:00.  The only odd thing that happened was the last couple of times I went outside the lights were now white instead of red. They were there for a full two hours, that I had seen, then the last time I went outside they were gone.  However the two hours that I did see them, they did not move what so ever.  And they were not stars.  I am a very frequent sky gazer, I know what I saw was a very odd occurence.  I honestly don't know if this has anything to do with it. But the following morning both mine, and my husband's car did not start.;41.6837;-88.3499000000001
I was coming out of the Best Buy in Oswego, IL .

I  put my two kids into their car seats , and looked up to stretch my back and from NW straight above me was a fast , fast moving satellite looking light.  I see satellites all of the time but this one moved from NW right above me to South end of the sky and right at the end did a hook to the west and then was gone. It traveled about 70% of the sky in 3 to 4 seconds .  No sound. I stood and thought for a second on what I saw.  I see satellites, too fast. I see meteors, not as fast and lasted way longer.  Not an airplane , way to fast and the pilot would have to pull like 20g’s to make that move at the end.  I told my wife, and guys at work.  I love to watch the stars but , for being outside of Chicago’s lights, we see a lot for a suburb.  But I never saw this.  Just wanted to put it in record .;41.6837;-88.3499000000001
