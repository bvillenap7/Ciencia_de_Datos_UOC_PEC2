My friends and I saw a bright white triangle shaped aircraft that we occasionally see on a regular basis and it sometimes follows us through our neighborhood.  There were also two smaller aircrafts traveling together at the same speed which were bright blue and sometimes they would all turn red at the same time.   We were driving in our car but they would follow us from the sky and as they passed our street lights, the lights would go out.  This occurred for a long time because we were afraid to go back home.  Also, this was not the first time this has happened.  It happens regularly and people tend to think we're crazy when we tell them but if we take them with and try to show them, it sometimes happens again.   We have tried to get videos and pictures but it's difficult to get it to show up on our phone cameras.;41.6837;-88.3499000000001
Triangle shaped space craft that has followed my friends and I when we drive through our neighborhood and is definetly not an airplane.;2015-04-11 22:00:00;2:00;Triangle shaped space craft that has followed my friends and I when we drive through our neighborhood and is definetly not an airplane. My friends and I have seen these crafts many times before and they sometimes follow us.  They are not planes, they become very bright looking like a shooting star but then dim down and follow us if we drive out of our neighborhood.   They are shaped like small triangles and can be bright white or sometimes red.   Also, the street lights would go out as it passed them like the energy was too strong.;41.6837;-88.3499000000001
