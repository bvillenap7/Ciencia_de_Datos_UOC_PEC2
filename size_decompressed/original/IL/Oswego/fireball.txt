Group of ten or more orange fireballs across Oswego, IL sky on 9/28/12;2012-09-28 21:30:00;10 minutes;Group of ten or more orange fireballs across Oswego, IL sky on 9/28/12 My Wife's Description: A group of about ten of these bright yellow orange lights traveling horizontally across the sky over Oswego tonight before they fizzled out one by one? It was about 9:30pm. I caught two of them on camera. My Description: They were not lanterns, they were moving across the sky at a high rate of speed and they were clearly in the stratosphere.  They were bright orange and much larger than any airplane light or weather balloon.  They actually shimmered like balls of flame.  We could see them from the horizon as we turned the corner onto our street.   We watched for ten minutes as one by one they moved across the sky until they went past and then we couldn't see their light any longer. We turned off both our cars in the driveway so we could hear if their was any sound emanating from the objects and they were totally silent. There were three teenagers across the street watching the same thing.  I've never seen anything like it.  They moved irregularly, but fast.  They did not glow of a normal light.  They were more like glowing embers with a red core that you could see more clearly as the orange/yellow would fade, until finally when they were just past &quotoverhead&quot, they disappeared.

Fireball type lights moving in sky;2015-07-02 22:20:00;2 minutes;Fireball type lights moving in sky I had just gotten home from seeing fireworks, pulled into my driveway and looked up into the sky to see a orangish yellowish glowing ball floating in the sky.   At first I had brushed it off as a plane, but then I quickly realized it was not.  It was not moving like plane as it was moving carefree and up/down swiftly across the sky.  Very low too about 1000 ft or so.   But when had passed me, I looked always for one second and another had appeared, same direction as the first one had came from.  It was also moving around the same and looked the same.   When I went to take a picture of it, it wouldn't show on my camera, then disappeared.;41.6837;-88.3499000000001
