Oswego, IL, UFO?  U tell me;2011-03-06 17:55:00;45 seconds tops;Oswego il, UFO? U tell me... I was driving west on rt 30 in Oswego/Montgomery, I'm the western sky I see a fireball falling at a 45 degree angle heading south. My Iphone was on my lap so I caught this photo of the object... http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y261/sparda4355/65f4759c.jpg   What was strange is that the flame went out and the object appeared to pull up from 45 degrees to about 30 degrees (give or take). Moments later two jets flew by, and circled back. This picture/incident has attracted a lot of attention and I've received lots of feedback... Others who saw similar things, people that think fermi lab is connected because of the shutting down of the particle accelerator, one person who thinks he might know here it landed due to military personal and police shutting down roads to search approx 30 miles west of where I witnessed the object, etc... Just google ((name deleted)) UFO to see just how much attention this received. ((NUFORC Note:  We have reviewed the four photos the witness sent to our Center.  One clearly is an airliner, probably an Airbus 320 with a blue tail.  The other three objects are so blurry, we cannot identify the objects.  PD));41.6837;-88.3499000000001
Oswego, IL lights in sky, possible disc;2012-01-03 15:25:00;1 hour;Oswego, IL lights in sky, possible disc THIS WAS WRITTEN YESTERDAY, JANUARY 3, 2012 I POSTED THE FIRST VIDEO OF THE LIGHT(S) ON YOUTUBE AND IT SHOULD SHOW UP SOON. My 12 yr old and I witnessed stationary lights in the sky again above Oswego, IL today. It was the same place and time of day as last November's sighting, 3:25pm in the western sky. The sun was getting lower in the sky and there were scattered clouds, though the sky was mostly sunny. The conditions were very similar to our sighting in November. One light appeared to the lower right (west) of the sun and the other was farther to the right (slightly northwest). We only saw them for a minute and then lost them and had to keep driving. When I got to our home, about a mile away, I got out our Sony Handycam and caught the lights on it. The stationary lights were in the clouds directly west, to the right of the setting sun, and the lights were lower and bigger than the airplanes that were present before and after. I focused in on one light 2 MINUTES INTO THE VIDEO and it appeared almost a triangular shape with fuzzy edges and it was a glowing reddish-pink on the top point, white in the center and green on the bottom two points. I was inside and there is dirt on the window. The video is shaky but if you pause on it you can really see the colors. I didn't know it at the time but I also caught three lights later in the video. These objects were stationary, not airplanes, as I was also watching and comparing them to airplanes with their contrails. There were no helicopters or small planes in the area when the lights appeared. As I was looking at the second video I caught what appears to be a dark disc skipping across the sky at minute 2:59. I don't think it was a bird because in the same area are geese with wings flapping and this was circular and much, much faster. Also, in the third video a dark helicopter flew by about 20 minutes after the lights were filmed, about 10 minutes after the disc. Right after the events our Wii froze and wouldn't turn off, has never happened before, and our cell phone wasn't responding when we wanted to play songs, which also hasn't happened before. I am also having problems sending this, have tried twice and it isn't working. The video files in my email also aren't working. Strange events here in Oswego today!;41.6837;-88.3499000000001
Orange/ Yellow orb moving at a high rate of speed with no sound or trails behind it;2020-05-02 21:25:00;3 minutes;Orange/ Yellow orb moving at a high rate of speed with no sound or trails behind it It was 9:25 pm when I was hanging out in my garage working on my cars. when I was going to go to the bathroom outside and I saw the Large orange ball on the horizon.  I started recording video on my phone right away not knowing what I was seeing.  it was a large orange ball that seemed like it was on fire but was very bright orange/yellow and was changing colors from orange to yellow.  this event lasted around 2 min.  I have seen meteors before in my life and this I could not explain.  I will send the video to your location along with maps and GPS coordinates where the UFO came from.;41.6837;-88.3499000000001
