Strange Shaped Rectangle Object Sighted 8 Miles NW of O'Hare International Airport;2007-04-16 13:00:00;1 minute;Strange Shaped Rectangle Object Sighted 8 Miles NW of O'Hare International Airport Was eating lunch in my car in a parking lot facing east.  I frequently see planes heading for descent and leaving into and out of O' Hare Internation Airport. The Airport was appoximately 10 Miles SE from the spot I was at in my car eating lunch.  I see planes all the time as I have lived in this area for 20 years, and this object was very strange in shape and was moving in a strange fashion enough to make me get out of my car to get  better look at point it out to someone in the strip mall.  The Object looked like 3 connected rectangles with a triangle shape at each top portion of the 3 rectangle shapes it was very long up and down a full fingernail at arms length but width being far less than a smaller passenger jet.   Also, the movement was dialognally down and the dialognally up and then the next instant, I could not not see it as it went farther over the horizon so I got on Golf Rd, to go east to follow is as it was not as high as the air traffic it looked about 5000-8000FT when I followed it for a minute and then stopped and looked down at my cell phone for a second and looked back up and it was completely gone in an empty sky.  Balloons would not disappear, and planes would would not either, also the shape was extremely odd, like a shape that would not even fly, it looked like three rectangles with little triangles up on each top and i saw a small green hue at the tipe of the top one.  Here is a Diagram I created using Google Maps Showing the Incidence in Relation to Airport and Air Traffic.  http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&z=11&ll=42.036034,-88.014908&spn=0.387591,0.6427&om=1&msid=108427926028705255190.0000011203e85682ed726&msa=0;42.0462076923077;-88.1007153846153
Massive 1/4 km+ sized UFO near Chicago;2009-03-12 00:45:00;3 minutes;Massive 1/4 km+ sized UFO near Chicago. This is the second time I've seen this exact same phenomena in this area.  Two stars out of place and moving so perfectly in formation that I get the distinct impression it was a single large object, at least 1/4 kilometer in size. It was about 20 degrees above the horizon and about a grapefruit in size at arm's length.  There were not enough stars as a background to see if the object was opaque between the two lights, nor was there enough moonlight or lit clouds to illuminate the side of it facing me.  The object/objects was between me and the stars on the Western horizon and was moving N/NE, slowly and steadily at maybe 100mph. I was able to observe it for about 3 minutes before the lights faded. The disappearance was very slow and gradual and could just as well been a changing angle as distance. The differences to the last time I saw it (reported here at ufocenter.com on or around 2002 in Rolling Meadows, IL at about 3:30am)was that this was slightly earlier in the evening and about 10 miles west the first siting.  I heard military aircraft immediately after the first siting, but the freezing cold breeze this time eliminated any chance of hearing anything.  Lastly, the first time it was a clearer night and my eyes could just barely detect a slight curved edge between the two lights like it was a gigantic saucer ufo with its back end tilted 45 degrees higher than the front as it flew forward.;42.0462076923077;-88.1007153846153
