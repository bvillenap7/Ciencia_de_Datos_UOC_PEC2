Giant bursts of light fill sky.;2013-12-04 16:30:00;3 minutes;Giant bursts of light fill sky. I caught the glimpse of crafts exiting the atmosphere rather fast. Hard to tell their exact shape.  At about 30 degrees off the eastern horizon (closest intersection Higgins and Huntington) I saw a huge flash of bright yellow/white light.  The flash was so bright it illuminated the whole sky and the outside as if it were daylight but only for a few milliseconds.  Then about 2 minutes later I saw the exact same thing.  No sounds produced.  No known aircraft (presently cloudy, drizzling).  If I hadn't already been looking out the window trying to figure out the first flash I would have missed the second one.  One thing to note although probably not related, was at the exact moment of only the first flash there was a single dog bark.;42.0462076923077;-88.1007153846153
