Orange fireball across the sky over Hoffman Estates IL;2002-06-26 23:23:00;90 seconds;Orange fireball across the sky over Hoffman Estates IL It was about 11:23pm and a group of us neighbors (there were 6 all total) were outside enjoying a cool evening talking as we do often in the summer months. I was leaning against my car facing South. Something caught my eye and I looked up to see a huge orange fireball coming toward me in the sky. I shouted to everyone to look up, at which time they all did. My husband went inside to get my 11 yr old son so that he could see it as well. It traveled very fast from South to North, in a straight line, and after about a minute and a half, it appeared to either burn out or disappear. There was a very faint, low-tone whooshing or rumbling sound as it passed overhead. All of us were stunned. We are certain there is a logical explanation for this, however an internet search, and search through the local news has turned up nothing. It did not appear to be a meteor, because the duration and size of the fireball. It would have had to been an enormous meteor to have last! ed that long (we have seen them many times before, and none have lasted this long, been this bright, or made any sound that we could hear). I am wondering if it was a satellite or some kind of re-entering the atmosphere, or perhaps space junk. I would love to know what it was.;42.0462076923077;-88.1007153846153
Red-orange orbs in Western sky;2013-08-03 22:20:00;2.0 minutes;Red-orange orbs in Western sky Two red-orange orbs spotted in the Western sky for two minutes 08/03/2013 10:20 PM C.S.T.  One at bogy 11:00 o'clock, and one at bogy 2:00 Altitude of orbs were roughly 50,000. - 70,000. feet. We believe these orbs to be three to five miles in diameter. Then, both blinked on and off a few times then, winked out as if traveling into outer space at an incredible speed. We have no reason to make this up. We believe these to be terrestrial. We do not believe in visitors from other planets, but wanted to share this sighting. These may have been parachute jumpers with flairs, or Chinese Lanterns. Thank you.;42.0462076923077;-88.1007153846153
