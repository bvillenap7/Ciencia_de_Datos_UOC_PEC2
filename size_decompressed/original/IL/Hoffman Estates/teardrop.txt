Teardrop/tic-tac spotted with a greenish white tail as it vanished into thin air.;2021-08-24 23:45:00;~15 minutes;Teardrop/tic-tac spotted with a greenish white tail as it vanished into thin air. I was driving home from work up Algonquin rd in hoffman estates no stars in the sky but something caught my eye, so i Gazed up and Saw this weird tear drop or tick tack looking object just cruising along. As i continued to drive i kept looking down at the road and back up to make sure my eyes were not messing with me but lucky my colleague saw it aswell. And suddenly after just tracking it for about 10 to 15min it just blips off into thin air but we could see a greenish white streak of light almost like a tail following it and it was gone. Clear sky no clouds no stars just the moon and you can see up for miles. Definitely a strange anomaly.;42.0462076923077;-88.1007153846153
