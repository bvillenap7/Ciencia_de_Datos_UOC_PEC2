saw something in the air;1998-11-26 20:30:00;3 seconds;saw something in the air I was driving East on Illinois 58 in Hoffman Estates, IL. I came to a stop at an intersection, when I happen to look up in the air. At that exact moment, a green streak went from the west to the east, high in the air, and then make a sharp 90 degree turn to the south, and then dissapeared. I had 2 other passengers in the car, and neither one of them saw the event. I pulled into a parking lot to get out and keep looking, and did not see anything except regular airplanes in the sky. I know those were airplanes since being within 10 miles of Chicago O'Hare Airport.;42.0462076923077;-88.1007153846153
