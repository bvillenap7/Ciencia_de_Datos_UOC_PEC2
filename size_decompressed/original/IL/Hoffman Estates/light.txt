White object over Hoffman Estates Illinois;2013-04-20 22:00:00;5 seconds;White object over Hoffman Estates Illinois I was outside  in a friends back yard and noticed what looked like a white star moving across the sky from north to south east very fast.  At first I thought it might be an aircraft, but there where no flashing tail lights.    I only witnessesed this object for a about 6 seconds moving across the sky then it disappeared.;42.0462076923077;-88.1007153846153
