The object was stationary, when first observed, due north of the city, and after 20 seconds it started moving eastward, slowly, for another 20 seconds, in a non-familiar flight path, and  then, suddenly, disappeared, when two east-west and west-east commercial aircraft flights approached at high altitude, and then two north-northwest  private aircraft passed at approximately 14,000 feet altitude.  At arm’s length, the object was one-third the size of my thumbnail. The sky area was observed for another 40 minutes, but the object failed to reappear.  The object was of continuous brightness, without strobe, green, or red, navigation lights, and was entirely silent. The local medical helicopter flies over my house regularly and I can say that it w! as not a conventional aircraft of any known kind.   As a trained, USAF, Intelligence Operations NCO, I am totally familiar with all known Jane’s listings of aircraft, and then some.  I am, also, a licensed AP Mechanic with Fighter Jets 1 & 2 experience.  I am, also, a student pilot and have worked over twenty-five years in the aircraft and weapons industry.  I did not have time to step inside for my digital camera.;39.9402875862069;-91.3615496551723
