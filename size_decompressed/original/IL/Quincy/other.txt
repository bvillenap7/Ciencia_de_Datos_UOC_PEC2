Four friends having just finished dinner and were setting on the patio facing the north.  One of us had just went inside when I spotted what I thought to be two airplanes and alerted my friend, my friend and I are both pilots so of course they drew our interest.  We almost instantly knew they were unusual we both decided they were flying at about 3 TO 5 thousand feet and at somewhere between 2 and 3 hundred miles per hour.  They appeared to be the shape of an upside down coffee cup but quite frankly it was difficult to tell because of darkness and a bright light on the bottom front, but we all agreed thats what we saw.  We were so excited by what we saw we hollered for the one who went inside to come out, we wanted her to witness to this also.  They were going in a southwesterly direction staggarded in 2-3-1-1 without formation.  We discussed it for awhile and all agreed we had seen something unusual.  There were seven unusual aircraft relatively close going at a high rate of speed and we could not hear them.  Shortly after they passed the local air ambulance rose an seemed in slow motion in comparison.;39.9402875862069;-91.3615496551723
