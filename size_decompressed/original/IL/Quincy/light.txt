My friend and I were observing stars on a clear night when I saw a strange white light with a red blinking light hovering on the southern horizen. After a few minutes it moved east at alternating speeds, sometimes stopping altogether. Then, while moving, it abruptly changed directions and headed diagonally west and upwards very quickly. Then it stopped and turned towards us, shining 4-6 extremely bright lights in our direction. It the proceeded move very fast, circling us and covering about 300 degrees in the sky. It flew off to the northeast. This all transpired in 7-10 minutes.  The object was about 3 miles away. It made no sound, and appeared to be very large.;39.9402875862069;-91.3615496551723

We hadnt moved and it was  now in a completely differnt spot then a red i think it was red light out of the west started falling from the sky as high as you could see up like a flare or something it fell to like as high as some smaller planes fly and it just floated there for a bout 15 min the hole time the other thing was still moving slowly towards it but it was still far away then two jets cam from the north west and circled around it  idont know we jumped in the car to get a closer look from the bridge (our way home)  and  now when we have this perfect view the star like object was gone gone it was simply gone...?  no one probably reads this stuff any ways ....i dont know....

I was leaving my work this evening. I'm a broadcast meteorologist & amateur astronomer. A bright light, about twice as bright as Venus, caught my attention in the northwest sky. This light was not moving, about 40 degrees above the horizon directly northwest. It gradually faded after about 12 seconds and still did not move. I ruled out any satellite flare or ISS transit.;39.9402875862069;-91.3615496551723
