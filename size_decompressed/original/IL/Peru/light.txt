My daughter noticed a red ball of light south of her location moving north making the red ball larger.  It stopped and two other red balls of light were generated. They all moved in a row then became one again, and soon disappeared.  I can not recall if they were directly over the concert goersâ€™ but she was excited when she called me.   I had seen my own UFO Aug of 2012 when it went right over my house.;41.3332;-89.125
