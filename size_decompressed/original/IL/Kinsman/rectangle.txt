Black square/rectangular 3 dimensional object with cone shape or antenna coming from top flying west with no wings or propellers;2011-01-10 07:00:00;seconds;Black square/rectangular 3 dimensional object with cone shape or antenna coming from top flying west with no wings or propellers I was driving Eastbound on Grand Ridge Road at 7:00am on 1-10-11.  A square/rectangular black 3 dimensional object with something sticking out of the top of it (like antenna, or something) was traveling opposite direction (West) on the South side of the road over the cornfield.  The object was not that high.  I am absolutely sure it was not a helicopter or plane.  I am positive it was not a loose kite or garbage bag that caught the wind.  This was an odd object that was very definitely NOT supposed to be there.  When I turned my head to watch it go by as I kept driving, the object was suddenly gone.  I even stopped my car and got out and looked and the object was no longer there.  The object had no propeller of any kind, no wings.  It just kind of flew by, keeping the same altitude the whole time.  It did not stop and hover or even hesitate, that I could see.  But I know what I saw and I know it was an object that was not a normal object in the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
