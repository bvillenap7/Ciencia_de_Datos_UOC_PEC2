dark,shadowy ,oval/rectangular object , with no lights,traveling at approaching/landing height level from the soutwest to norteast.;2007-11-01 23:35:00;5 seconds;dark,shadowy ,oval/rectangular object , with no lights,traveling at approaching/landing height level from the soutwest to norteast. i was sitting in my vehicle in a dimly lit parking lot facing west and could see a good portion of the night sky.i was looking up at a water tower and watching airplanes in the night sky.i happened to be just southeast of o'hare airport and realized i was in the flight path of landing and departing commercial aircraft. as i was looking into the western horizon,i was gazing at the water tower when i noticed an object approaching from the southwest heading to the northeast.it seemed to be at landing and takeoff level height.traveling somewhat just above the horizon.it appeared to be somewhere in between 4 to 10 city blocks away as it traveled from soutwest to northeast.the total duration of time i had visual contact with this object was about 5 seconds. the object was oval at first and then changed to rectangular as it headed northeast.i could barely see the object because it had no flashing lights.no lights at all as a matter of fact. i could just see a dark object and the outline of it.if i was not looking up at at the sky, i would not have noticed it at all.it really had the appearance of a shadow flying along the horizon.it was darker than the night sky and as far as i know, the moon had not yet risen above the horizon in the west. was very strange to see.;41.935;-87.8737000000001
