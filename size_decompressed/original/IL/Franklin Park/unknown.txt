This was no airplane;2017-04-28 20:18:00;14 minutes;This was no airplane We stepped out on our deck to smoke a cigarette, and I noticed this red light in the sky is was coming from the north and heading south it was moving very fast my husband yelled for me to get my camera and I recorded what we saw at first there were like 6 or 7 of them and they would slow down and disappear in the clouds and then a few seconds later another one was coming moving very fast and then another one this lasted about 13 or 14 minutes I took some videos and post them on Facebook to see if anybody else saw this I watched the news and I didn't hear nothing and friend told me to repot it to a ufo web site these were no airplane as I live close to the airport airplanes make a lot of noise there was no noise it was quiet the also had a red glow to them I really don't know what they were but I figured it wouldn't hurt to find out.;41.935;-87.8737000000001
