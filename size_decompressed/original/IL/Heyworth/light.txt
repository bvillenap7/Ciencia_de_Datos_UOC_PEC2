She asked me to look out to see what it was. I originally thought it was a red light, possibly a tower beacon.  However, after observing for a few seconds I thought it moved. As we watched, it appeared to move upward again but very slightly so I was unsure it moved. Then, I saw a discernable movement, up and somewhat spiraled.  It then slowly continued upward until it was above the line of sight from the window. My wife got up and went to the patio door and saw it go up,overhead and vanish from her line of sight. She looks that way every night, although she has seen what she described as strange objects, she has not seen this discernable of an unexpalinable light before.;40.3308;-88.9816
