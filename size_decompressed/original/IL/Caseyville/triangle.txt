A triangle shaped low flying object was seen near Old Collinsville Rd in Caseyville, IL on January 16, 2007.;2007-01-16 20:00:00;1-2 hrs.;A triangle shaped low flying object was seen near Old Collinsville Rd in Caseyville, IL on January 16, 2007. Nighttime on January 16, 2007.  I was out walking my dog and I saw a very low flying object around 8- 8:30 PM.  It was over a corn field near Old Collinsville Road.  The object came towards me and I panicked and ran home.  Then I went back out and from a distance observed the object.  I don't see how this could be an airplane.  The object would go very low, then zoom high.  I am not 100% sure of the shape, although it had 2 white headlights in front and a red flashing light on the side.  I think it might have been triangle shaped. I think it was gray or silver, but it was dark outside.  I thought it was a plane at first, but planes can't zoom up and down.  About 30 minutes later I noticed lot's of other planes in sky and around 9:15 I noticed another object flying low.  I am fairly sure it was a helicopter (sounded like one) and I think it was looking for the UFO.  Two of the other planes were flying close together and I think they were also looking for / following the object.  The helicopter flew around the area for at least 30 - 40 minutes and kept back tracking.  The object I saw made no noise.  You might be interested to know that the Travel Channel did a special called UFO in Illinios and it was specifically about a UFO in this area back in January of 2000 or 2001.  However, I wasn't looking for what I saw.  I regret not getting in my car to follow the object, but I was alone and afraid.  I'm sorry I can't provide more details.;38.6382;-90.0123
