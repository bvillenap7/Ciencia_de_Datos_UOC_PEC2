HUGE reddish - orange fireball seen in Caseyville, IL;2010-08-25 22:00:00;:02;HUGE reddish - orange fireball seen in Caseyville, IL I saw a reddish – orange HUGE fireball while driving on Old Milburn School House Rd. 2 nights in a row around 10:30 pm at night.  I can’t remember the exact dates but these sightings occurred between August 20 – 27th.   I was driving alone.  There was another car on the road ahead of me.  I did not pull over to look at the object or drive closer to it.  I just went straight home.  These are the fireballs that have been reported throughout the U.S. starting in July.  I reported these sightings to MUFON as well as other sightings of a craft / spaceship that have all occurred in the same area over the past 2 ½ years.  These sightings occurred about 25 minutes from Scott Air force Base.  This is the same area as the famous 2000 UFO that was chased by 4 or 5 police officers. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
