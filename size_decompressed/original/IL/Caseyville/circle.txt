Golden - yellow, half dark ball moved across sky and turned into an orange flash in Caseyville, IL on 9-15;2010-09-15 23:00:00;:05;Golden - yellow, half dark ball moved across sky and turned into an orange flash in Caseyville, IL on 9-15 On Sept. 15th I pulled into my driveway around 11pm at night and saw a golden-yellow circle in the sky slightly below treetop level.  At first I thought it was the moon but something looked off.  The circle was slightly oval, seemed lower and was brighter than the moon.  Plus half of it was dark.  It looked like it was divided in half.  Half dark and half golden - yellow. I went inside my house and a few minutes later looked outside and noticed the “moon” was higher and farther away.  I ran to get my mother.  When I came back outside the object was orange and moving very fast across the sky.  By the time my mother arrived outside the object was just an orange flash behind the trees.  The object then disappeared from sight.  The object was silent. I submitted another report to NUFROC a few minutes ago about seeing a HUGE reddish – orange fireball in the same area.  I accidentally entered 1 & 2 witnesses because I was going to submit these reports together but changed my mind. I declined to be contacted for these fireball sightings because there is nothing else I can add.  I have seen an actual “spaceship” on different occasions in the same exact general area and reported them to MUFON.  I just decided it might be a good idea to report to both sights.  All of these sightings occurred about 25 minutes from Scott Air Force Base.;38.6382;-90.0123
