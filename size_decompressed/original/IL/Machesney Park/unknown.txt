There were about five lights and they were not moving in the sky, which I would expect if it was a plane.  The two lights on the rightmost section, and the one on  the leftmost section, were the brightest.   I followed the lights which appeared to flash periodically and they were red and green.  It was a clear night with no clouds in the sky and almost full moon.  At one point the lights turned off, then turned on, then off again,and finally turn back to stay.  The lights appeared to eventually lean to the right.  The lights traveled from the northeast to the southwest.  I had called my wife to tell her what I saw and and our kids looked outside and could see it too, even when I was 25 miles away from home.  I drove from Winnebago County to Stephenson County till it was getting late and I was not catching up to it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.  PD));42.3546;-89.0435
