COULD SEE HIGH INTENSITY LIGHTS (3) FROM 2 MILES.  TOO HIGH TO BE STREET LIGHTS AND TOO LOW TO BE AIRPLANE.  TRIANGLE  1 WHITE LIGHT ON;2001-01-25 23:15:00;15 MINUTES;COULD SEE HIGH INTENSITY LIGHTS (3) FROM 2 MILES.  TOO HIGH TO BE STREET LIGHTS AND TOO LOW TO BE AIRPLANE.  TRIANGLE  1 WHITE LIGHT ON EACH POINT, 1 ELONGATED RETANGLE RED LIGHT ON BACK CENTER ALMOST COVERING HALF OF OBJECT. OBJECT SEEMED TO BE STANDING STILL.  AS I GOT CLOSER IT WAS HOVERING OVER AREA AND SEEMED TO MOVE SLOWLY IN A SOUTH EASTERN DIRECTION. IT WAS WHEN I WAS TRAVELING IN THE SAME DIRECTION THAT I COULD SEE THE SHAPE.  IT WAS DARK IN COLOR BUT COULD ONLY SEE SHAPE.  THE LIGHTS WERE INTENSE.  I TURNED WEST AND TRAVELED ABOUT 1 MILE AND SAW #2 TRAVELING SOUTH WESTERN DIRECTION WITH THE SAME INTENSE LIGHTING, SAME HEIGTH IN SKY. I THEN TURNED NORTH AND #3 CAME OUT ABOVE MY SUB DIVISION SLOWLY AND HOVERED OVER MACHESNEY MALL WHICH WAS RIGHT NEXT TO ME.   I STOPPED AND WATCHED FOR A COUPLE MINUTES AND PROCEEDED AROUND THE CORNER TO MY HOME. WHILE STOPPED THE OBJECT SEEMED TO JUST STAND STILL IN THE SKY.  WATCHING FROM MY DRIVE I COULD SEE THE OBJECT SLOWLY MOVING SOUTH.  WHEN I WENT INTO MY HOME I COULD STILL SEE THE LIGHTS.  ALL 3 OBJECTS LOOKED IDENTICAL.  COULD NOT SEE ANY DETAIL ON OBJECT.  NOISE WAS LIKE A LOUD STEADY HUM LIKE FROM A HUGE ELECTRIC MOTOR.;42.3546;-89.0435
Strange triangular orange -red hovering object.;2015-07-04 21:30:00;5 minutes;stange triangular orange -red hovering object. It was 930 pm on the fourth of July, we were watching fireworks on friends deck when the orange triangular object seem to float from west to east along latham road near forest hills rd. it was large and stood out from area display of fireworks show.  It was definitely hovering, no sound, and we agreed it seemed it was watching the event.  It  then moved slightly east then decended straight up -slowly until it was out of sight.  I have been a pilot, flown in helicopters and have seen drones, this was none of these as we tracked it with binoculars.;42.3546;-89.0435

We saw a huge triangular type ship in the sky, and ((it)) had greenish red purple colors at each end!   My fiance and I both witnessed it!  It was nothing I have ever seen in my life?   What did we see tonight, because there is nothing in the planet earth that's that big it looked like it went into light speed like in star wars it was gone at the blink of an eye!;42.3546;-89.0435
