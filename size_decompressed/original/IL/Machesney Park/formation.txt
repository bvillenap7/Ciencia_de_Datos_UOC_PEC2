Bright orange lights over Machesney Park Illinois;2011-10-28 20:15:00;30 seconds;Bright orange lights over Machesney Park Illinois 10/28/2011 I saw seven bright orange lights travel from south to north at a quick rate of speed.  These lights were totally silent and a brilliant orange color, almost liquid in its shimmer.  The lights were round in the middle with wisps of plasma like light extended on two opposing sides.  I followed them for about a short time (the length of time it took for my dog to do her business) and they disappeared one at a time at about the same spot in the sky.   These lights had no tail, no smoke, and no sound at all This occurred in the Machesney Park Illinois area, near the border with Wisconsin.;42.3546;-89.0435
