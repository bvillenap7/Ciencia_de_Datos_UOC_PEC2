The light was opaque in color with.  While in site, the light had no movement.  It was a fixed position. As I exited my car after returning home from work, I noticed a light in the sky. Opaque in color, and no movement.  After about 5 sec the damn thing just blinked out.  I'm a truckdriver that has worked the latenight and predawn hours for years.  I've seen shooting stars, meteors, re-entry junk, and aircraft.  My only response to what I saw was, aw Jeez.  Because I can't explain what I saw.  My exact cords at the time were 42deg20.97N 089deg01.24W;42.3546;-89.0435

Star like objects moved from left to right, also made circles while moving about.  These objects moved at a steady pace and seemed to get lower and lower.  They are in a diagonal line moving down in a perfect row.  They also appear to be flashing, some even look a reddish color.  Although, the duration of this sighting was for about 2 hours, they did not seem to disappear.;42.3546;-89.0435
