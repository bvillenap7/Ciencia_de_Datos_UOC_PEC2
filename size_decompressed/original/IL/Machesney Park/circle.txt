5 orange objects in the sky;2011-07-07 21:00:00;2-3minutes;5 orange objects in the sky Came outside around 9/9:30 pm to let the dogs out, noticed the beautiful moon, asked my husband to come outside and see it, a few seconds later we saw orange pulsating objects in the sky, moving westward very fast.   I ran inside and grabbed my iPhone to video them, by the time I got back out they were already further away, my phone doesn't zoom so what we saw in person does not compare to what we captured on video.  There was 5 of them, clearly not fireworks, not Chinese lanterns, they were up too high to be anything we could explain.  We have never witnessed anything like this before. They were clearly bright orange and pulsating, not flickering like a flame at all.  They just vanished, they did not fly out of sight like planes do, they just disappeared.  We believe we saw UFO's.  I have posted the video on YouTube (macawgrey232) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));42.3546;-89.0435
