Blue rounded light in sky seen traveling at high speed.;2008-08-19 21:00:00;30 seconds;Blue rounded light in sky seen traveling at high speed. We observed a single point of blue light (orb, star-like) traveling from east to south. This blue light did not flash, but was continuous in color. It was traveling at a speed that we have never seen a plane or a helicopter travel at. The light traveled across the sky at such a speed that it disappeared into the distance so quickly that we were unable to see it any longer (there were no clouds in the direction the blue light was). We have a good deal of knowledge and experience in astronomy as well as physics - this was definitely not a meteor, a star, or a planet.;42.2645000000001;-88.0033999999999
