It moved west to east I am a male, 50 years old. I am a professional truck driver, married, I have 4 children and 6 grandchildren. On 11/16/99 at 6:05 c.s.t. I was in my terminal at Mundelein, IL. dropping my trailer, when I observed an object comming out of the west, it was a brilliant green fireball with a white and green sparkeler type tail. This object was low and moving in a straight line directly in front of me (south). The distance of first contact to the end of viewing was about 180 degree's from horizon to horizon, and about 15 to 20 degree's up. The time envolved with this event was about 10 to fifteen seconds. There were 4 other drivers in the yard that saw this object, and they confirmed what i had seen. The terminal is in open area, with very few obstructions, so we got a very good look at this object.;42.2645000000001;-88.0033999999999
Yellow ball of flame traveling through the sky.;2012-08-18 20:15:00;s minutes;Yellow ball of flame traveling through the sky. We were in the front yard when the wife and I saw a large round yellow ball of flame going from the South East to the North West.    There is a layer of clouds out and it was below this level.   There was no sound to it, just the large round ball of yellow. It lasted a good 90 seconds to 2 minutes, as it traveled North, it got brighter until it went behind the houses and we could not see it any more.;42.2645000000001;-88.0033999999999

Observed a rather large orange/red ball move slowly across the sky from northeast to southwest.  It was below cloud cover, and I watched it until it became quite small.   As I turned to go inside, a second orange/red ball was observed on what appeared to be the same path.;42.2645000000001;-88.0033999999999
