Unknown-shaped object with small dim light bobbing through the sky;2010-07-15 04:30:00;15 minutes;Unknown-shaped object with small dim light bobbing through the sky It was approximately 04:30 AM in the morning of July 15th, 2010, when my sister's fiance dragged me outside in my back yard to see this strange bobbing/darting light in the sky.  You could vaguely see the silhouette of a structure that it was attached to.   It would slowly bob across the sky (sort of like a bouncing ball during a sing-a-long broadcast or karaoke-style television program would have used to follow the words).  The shape of the structure was really hard to make out because it was very high in the sky.   But, it moved too quick from left to right or side to side back and forth each way to be something like a star.  As I type this it is still out there.   We are capturing video footage of it!;41.5092;-87.5938
