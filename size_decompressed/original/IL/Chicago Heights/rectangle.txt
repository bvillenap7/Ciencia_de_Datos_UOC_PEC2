I was working third shift as a security officer in a industrial district of chicago heights.  On this  night i was called outside  to  a police  vehicle blocking off the intersection directly in front of our building.   After a few minutes of watching to see  if anything was going to happen a large number of police vehicle chasing a civilian building flew by the intersection.   About twenty seconds after the chase went by i looked caty corner from our building to the large factory across the street.  About a thousand of feet it seemed a rectangular shaped outlined by an extremely bright lights seemed to hover over the factory.  My first thoughts were that it was a helicopter involved in the police chase.  I pointed the object out to my partner and we began to talk about.  I was airborne in the army and he was a navy seals boat operator in the navy and we were both puzzled because it looked like no helicopter we had ever seen.  I will have to say we couldn't see any details of the craft due to the brightness of the lights sorrounding it.  However we were talking for about a minute when we heard the sounds of the police sirens coming back towards our position.   We looked around for the police cars and then both looked back up at the object and about ten seconds later, the vehicle seemed to shoot directly straight up at an extremely high rate of speed, faster than anything i ever saw in the military.  The lights dissappeared within seconds.  I was wondering if you had any explanation of what it could be?;41.5092;-87.5938
