Orange orbs.  ((anonymous report));2011-02-18 19:00:00;10 minutes;Driving home off 394 and seen 7 orange orbs near the horizon..  We pulled over to see the lights in the sky.  They moved around in different directions, not how a conventional aircraft at all.  Up, down, diagonal.  Some began to blink out and re-appear in another part of the sky.  3 of the orange orbs created a triangle in the sky.   We got back into our vehicle and looked out the window until we could no longer see the lights..  I wish we would have stayed to see how long the light were there.  I didn't stay beings we were parked along side a very busy expressway with my kids in the car. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

I watched dozens of orange lights travel from north to south in random, unorganized groups.   I saw dozens, my sister stated she watched for several minutes before calling me and she saw at least a hundred of the lights.   I tried to search online to see if there was military or massive airline movement but found nothing.   There was no sound, and I would really like an explanation.

UFO travailing like a family.  ((Starlink satellites?))((anonymous report));2020-06-24 20:00:00;10;UFO travailing like a family Yesterday driving home after leaving my friends home I noticed lights eyes level in the sky coming my way.  Once I looked up my heart started to panic.  I’ve seen ufo’s before but never as close as they were yesterday.  One light after another.  They were bright as a Roman candle but stayed in a straight line.  It was overwhelming and nervous af.  I saw at least thirty or them. I am not exaggerating.  They were close to each other.  Very close.  I know air traffic control wouldn’t have approved if they were planes.  But they couldn’t have been. You couldn’t hear anything. Just light after light.  They were headed east towards Indiana. I never been religious but after yesterday I believe everything we hear about.  God, Heavens earth, dinosaur, aliens, UFO’s are real. 2020 has been a hell of a year.  These stimulus checks won’t help at all if they decide to truly invade us. The government is a lie. They don’t tell us the truth;41.5092;-87.5938
