Very clear night, all the stars were out.  I heard a very high pitched whirling noise from above and looked up.  Saw random flashing lights moving quickly to the North and quickly to the West.  Craft did not slow down to take the sharp turn.  Watched it move to the West for about 10 seconds and it made another sharp turn to the South moving farther up into the air.  When I got into the house, all I could say was that there were a lot of stars out that night.  I think I was in shock.;41.5092;-87.5938
Orange glowing lights over Chicago Heights, IL;2012-07-04 21:20:00;30 minutes;Orange glowing lights over Chicago Heights, IL Pulsating orange orbs moving from west to east in a line formation.  When they came overhead they actually looked elongated like cigars.  They were as high as a jet aircraft and completely silent.  We were attending the local fireworks display on a field.  There were hundreds of others who were seeing and commenting on these lights.  This all occurred before the fireworks had actually started.  Surprised that there have been no news report or other comments made by the many people that saw the lights.;41.5092;-87.5938
