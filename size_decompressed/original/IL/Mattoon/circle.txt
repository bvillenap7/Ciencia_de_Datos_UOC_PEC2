It was not blinking, but just a stale light.  It was moving at a somewhat fast speed, but I managed to get 2 pictures of it.  I got 3 other family members to come out and see it.  By the time they got there it was nearly out of sight.  We watched it until it was fully out of sight.  It didn't travel up, but away.;39.4796;-88.3755000000001

While watching television I heard a strange sound from outside my house. When I looked outside there was a circular light flashing green and yellow that flew past my house disappearing just above the tree line across the street. As a mother of one this was very surprising.;39.4796;-88.3755000000001
