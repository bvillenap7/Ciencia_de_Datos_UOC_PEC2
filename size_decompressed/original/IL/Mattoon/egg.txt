Yellow egg shaped object in the eastern sky flew south;2009-06-22 18:35:00;10 seconds;Yellow egg shaped object in the eastern sky flew south I was on my way home from buying a soda from a nearby business' soda machine when I looked up and saw an egg shaped object in the eastern sky.  The point of it was facing the south.  It was a solid yellow color, and was completely lit up.  As soon as I saw it, it started to move south, and quickly changed color to match the color of the sky.  I could only see the outline as it moved south, behind a big cumulus cloud. It didnâ€™t come out the other side of the cloud.;39.4796;-88.3755000000001
