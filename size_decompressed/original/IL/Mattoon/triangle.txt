Six, red, bright, non-blinking lights that hoovered for minutes and disappeared.;2011-08-13 21:50:00;5 minutes;Six, red, bright, non-blinking lights that hoovered for minutes and disappeared. To Whom It May Concern: Last night, at roughly 9:30PM (21:50), my husband and I were driving home.  We were traveling north on US Highway 45 leaving Mattoon, IL when I saw 6 bright red lights.  I said to my husband multiple times, “What are those lights?”   I thought maybe RR Donnelly’s had installed red lights atop of its large building.   I continued down the road and finally parked in the entrance of Alton, a business which is on US Highway 45.  I got out of the car and pointed to the red lights to show my husband. Three of the lights were in a triangular shape.  They did not blink and were bright red.  The other three were also bright red and did not blink, but they were in the shape of a large, very open V.  They appeared to hoover over RR Donnelly’s.  Huge!   We got back in the car so we could get closer.  As I drove we lost sight of the lights because of the line of trees along the railroad tracks.  Once our view was clear again there was only one red light and it quickly disappeared.  They didn’t seem to speed away as much as just disappear.  There were storm/rain clouds to the east and I thought maybe they had moved into the clouds and I could no longer see them. We went home and I called the non-emergency police number and told the woman what I saw and asked her if anyone else had called in concerning red lights in the sky.  She said No. There was, what appeared to be, an airplane flying from east to west in the very same area as the red lights.  I say airplane only because it did have blinking lights.  It was below the red lights. Thank you;39.4796;-88.3755000000001
