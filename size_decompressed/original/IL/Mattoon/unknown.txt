PD));2018-02-13 14:30:00;5 minutes;Cloaked UFO in daytime over Mattoon, Illinois, watertower is huge. I was with my wife recycling at the recycle bins.  The clouds looked like whip cream so I was trying out my new camera mx app filters.  I put it on negative and noticed a black dot moving between the water tower and the American flag. I lost it.  We drove away.   However, I continued filming the sky.  Later when looking back at the video I noticed something that looked cloaked flying over the car.  Upon further investigation I found that the black dot was actually a part of a triangle of dots moving in unison and other dark areas moved with them.  The drive also catched many other unidentified flying objects.  The video mist be watched to be believed.;39.4796;-88.3755000000001
