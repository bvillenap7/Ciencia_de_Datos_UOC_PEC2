Red rectangle  with bubble low in the sky.;2007-06-30 00:00:00;3 minutes;Red rectangle  with bubble low in the sky. My granddauter and I were on the 12 tee at Mattoon golf club when she said what is that.  We saw these moon size balls of light appear and then shrinks back into themselves.  About a dozen times.   A couple tending flowers about 30 feet away they saw them too.   After they stopped a red rectangular craft with no wings or tail but with a bubble on the front flew almost right over us.  There was a commercial jet above this and you could clearly see ite wings and tail.  The vapor trail that came out of the object came out at an angle, not directly from the back.   The couple saw it too and didnt think anything of it.   They just went back to their gardening. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting in 2007 is approximate.
