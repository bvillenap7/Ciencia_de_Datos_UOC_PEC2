While driving, I glanced to the night sky and noticed two blinking lights approaching from me rather slowly and at no significant height, roughly 150 ft up.  By the time the craft was over me I had stopped my car to stare in awe at this object.   It looked as following triangular solid black craft, three bright white lights at each corner on the bottom of the triangle, one red blinking light and another that blinked a blue/white light, moved at about 30 mph, made no noise except for a faint humming, and it appeared to not mind being detected.   Also, the three white lights on the craft were not attached to the craft, it was as though they were balls of energy, or something of that nature, that were floating in a hollowed out portion of the ship.   I watched it lurk its way over fields and even saw a small black SUV driving dangerously fast towards this unknown object.   The last part of the objects show was the most mind puzzling.  It became on big ball of light of in! the distance, took a 90 degree turn, hovered over the horizon for some seconds, then flashed a light so bright it looked like lightning.   After this I didn't see it again.  Im only putting this up cause what I've seen has changed me forever, and I need to know that I and the friends i was with were not the only ones to have seen this.;42.437;-89.3122
