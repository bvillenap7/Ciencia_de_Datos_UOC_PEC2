Bright  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus.  PD));2004-05-07 21:23:00;aprox. 40 MIN;I have been observing this object on and off for over 5 months.It appears as a bright star in the west/northwest sky (from my vantagepoint) that varies in intensity from very bright to fading into the darkness.I have observed this object through a telescope and, at first glance, saw a crystalline structure that changed as the object pulsed and changed color.The colors ranged from yellow to green and to red. I went to get my wife and looked at the object again only to see a perfect yellow/orange sphere that appeared to have energy flowing across the surface. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness was looking at Venus.  PD));42.437;-89.3122
