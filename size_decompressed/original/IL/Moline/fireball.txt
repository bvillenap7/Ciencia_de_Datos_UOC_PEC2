Fireball in Moline, Illinois;2011-08-06 21:00:00;one minute;Fireball in Moline, Illinois My husband and I were walking our quiet neighborhood on a clear night when we spotted an orange/red fireball hovering low in the sky.  Its distinct, glowing appearance seemed to be on fire and was so low in the sky that it would be nearly impossible to miss seeing because it was literally right in front of us. It was clearly visible in the western sky and seemed to heading right toward us moving at a slow speed.  No sound could be heard from this object and we quickly assumed it was not an airplane.  We only saw one object and it was so unusual to us that we stopped, frozen in our tracks, debating as to what kind of object it was, because neither of us had experienced anything like it before. This fire in the sky moved in an southerly direction and glowed for approximately one minute before fading away.;41.4903459999999;-90.4968870000001
