This happened at the Quad-city skyraiders model aircraft field and about six witness. The runway is north/south and we face east to fly there.  From the south east and to my right appeared an unusual craft. I thought what the heck is that?  It seemed tobe about 100-200 alt. moving north and on the east side of our field.  It came down almost landing in the corn.  But just hovered for a while then moved north north/east and became about the size of a small dot but ivsable.then all of a sudden it shot up very rapidly and was in the alto/strst clouds and dissapeared.  Shape/color??  The craft was vertical in nature but it was hard to tell the exact shape due to its almost shimmering nature.  It almost hurt your eyes to look at it.  It was almost like looking at something without glasses.  No sound. I know the gov.has ducted fan RPV's. I am an ex-test pilot an this was very unusual. Oh about a week later an unmarked OD heli buzzed our field.? I am telling this now due to just finding your site.  Also called Moline tower and asked if they had observer it. they said no an evenif we had we would not admit it.Our flying field is only a few miles from MLI airport.The color of the craft was a silvery-grey with hints of glowing off pink or orange.
