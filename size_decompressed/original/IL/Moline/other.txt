Noticed out of west facing window multiple bright lights passing low across the sky from north to south.  Some would be alone, while they often appeared in clusters.  They were moving more or less horizontally, but did not follow the same path and were not always parallel to each other and would sometimes change direction slightly and angle up or down. They did not flame out like a meteor, but remained bright and visible until out of sight. They were at various altitudes though all were relatively low on horizon. Couldn't be sunlight reflected off objects as there was heavy cloud cover and sun was not high enough to reach them at that distance in the west.;41.4903459999999;-90.4968870000001
