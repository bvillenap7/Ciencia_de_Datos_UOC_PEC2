Two seperate orbs pass slowly over my house.;2008-10-31 18:53:00;4 min;Two seperate orbs pass slowly over my house. I was standing on my front porch, I had just lit a cigar and neighborhood kids were trick or treating.  As I turned around toward the street my eye caught a red light in the Sky at about 2 o'clock high.  This red light was approaching slowly toward me.  At first I thought it was a plane however it was moving too slow to be a plane. I stepped off the porch to observe the light as it was passing over my house.  It passed straight over my house at a height of I would guess to be several thousand feet.  Looking at the object straight above it had no flashing marker lights as a plane would have.  The object appeared to be round and it glowed orange/red.  As it passed over the brightness of the object suddenly changed to a faint red dot.  I could track this dot as it proceeded North East.  I lost it as it passed behind the neighbor’s house. The object made no noise. I called my Father at 6:58pm after the object left my field of view.  He lives about 20 minutes in that direction and I asked if he would go out and look west.  Hoping he would see this object as it approached.  My Father noticed a white light moving slowly but didn’t think anything more of it. While on the phone with my Father I looked up and another Orb was moving on the same trajectory.  I disconnected the call and managed to take one photo with my camera phone. The orb faded out as the first one did and I could track a smaller faint dot as it moved North East.   Second Sighting was at 7:00 pm, shortly after two older teens were walking in front of the house.  I asked them if they saw anything and the teens indicated that they saw what looked like a flying pumpkin.;41.4903459999999;-90.4968870000001
