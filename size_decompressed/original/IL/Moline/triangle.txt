black metallic upside down triangle object appeared hovering 15 feet above and 10 feet away from side of I-74 bridge.;2003-06-20 20:35:00;20 seconds;black metallic upside down triangle object appeared hovering 15 feet above and 10 feet away from side of I-74 bridge. I was driving over I-74 bridge going towards Moline, IL from Davenport,IA when I saw it.  There is so much construction (and of course NO ONE WORKING at the time) taking place on the bridge that they have lowered the speed limits on the bridge.  I was just getting across the bridge and was looking around towards the east where the Kone tower is and I saw the small elongated upside down triangle shaped object (looked like the size of small black plastic office garbage can turned to the narrow side) just floating there just 10 feet off the bridge on the other side to the east.  I slowed WAY down to about 15MPH so I could take a good look at it.  It was a clear blue sky and no planes, helicopters, birds, no noise....nothing else in the sky near where I was looking.  I should mention that I wasn't look up I was looking almost straight out of my car window at it.  For the most part it was dark in color but reflecting some light towards me since the sun was going down in the west.  I was totally excited because first of all I have heard of things just like this but never seen one till now and second it was only about 40 feet from my car during the day light.  No strange lights in the sky with this one. It was an actual object there that wasn't there when I went back 2 minutes later.  I ride this bridge every single day (back and forth) so I'm very familiar with what is going on.  There were no lights on it but there was something strange on it.  At the very top of the upside down triangle it had what looked like a round dish shape thing.  I stared at it for about 20 seconds total before the cars behind me started to approach.  You can't stop on the bridge since it's only one lane now with all the construction going on.  I watched it in my side view mirror as it continued to levitate there about 10 feet off the side of the bridge.  I took the first exit and headed down to the Kone tower which is on the east side of the bridge to see if I could find it again.  After the exit I lost sight of it an! d never saw it again.  I'm not sure how long it was there but I do know that I got a really good look at it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness is a student, who is engaged in a demanding course in the hard sciences.

MISSOURI INVESTIGATORS GROUP Report:  Black triangle ship moving west to east,;2005-09-20 23:00:00;20 seconds;Black triangle ship moving west to east, lights on the edges of the ship size of 3 airplanes wide estimated altitude at 4,000 feet. Moving relatively fast 3 times faster than plane speed non-level and banking flight absolutely and completely silent -- no engine sound whatsoever no delayed jet sound, no nothing. Highly strange. NOTE: Follow up with witness:  The police said they would patrol the neighborhood but that was it.  They took the report seriously asked a lot of questions about size of it, altitude, speed, direction, etc. which I gave them.  And that was it.  I asked them if there were any other reports of a large black triangle ship over the city and they checked with the police dispatcher who reported that, no, there were no other reports.  I would guess the police would have a report, but I do not have it and do not have a copy of it.

A huge giant black isoceles triangular craft flew over in total silence and then took off at Mach 10;2005-10-20 22:30:00;2 minutes;A huge giant black isoceles triangular craft flew over in total silence and then took off at Mach 10 Wife and I saw a H-U-G-E black isoceles triangle ship in the sky that was about 1000 foot up in the sky and blocked out a huge slice of the sky as it went over.   I was able to see structure on the underside it appeared to look very like a starship as you would imagine it to be with various pipes, channels, etc. running underside.   There were dim yellow lights at the apex of the angles of the triangles, 3 in all.   The thing moved totally silently from west to east in no hurry I would estimate no more than 50 mph.  It was HUGE.  Wife and I both exclaimed amazement to each other at the size and silence of the thing and the dim yellow lights and the structure on undercarriage of the thing.   It then slowly banked to the left and went like Mach 10 all of the sudden and was gone.  Not one sound...  we reported sighting to police.;41.4903459999999;-90.4968870000001

However it moved, looked, and sounded like nothing I have ever seen. It was a triangular craft, I first noticed it driving to work, ( I work third shift ) it looked from the side like a helicopter.  It had a spotlight coming out the front, like it was concentrated on something.   The UFO was stationary in the air and made no noise like a helicopter would, there were no propellers chopping it was just sitting still in the air.  The UFO was really close to my parking lot at work, which is really close to a runway at the airport nearby.   As I got closer to the parking lot at work I could see the UFO better.  I got a glimpse of the craft from underneath it, it was triangular in shape almost like a stealth bomber.   I got out of my car, and heard the UFO make absolutely no sound, it started to turn at a 45 degree angle and faded away out of sight.   The UFO had a light on each point and was very clearly a triangle.  It remained still, until it just started moving with no sign of an engine or propellers. This was near an airport, so it could be just a regular aircraft, but like I said before, it was very different from anything I have ever seen.

Orange/Yellowish square to triangle appeared directly over house in Moline, IL;2012-09-03 21:45:00;1 minute;Orange/Yellowish square to triangle appeared directly over house in Moline, IL While standing in the back yard my wife looked up and saw four (4) bright lights (all the same color - orange/yellow) sort of in a square in the sky directly above her.  As it moved on the 4 lights became 3 and it looked more like a triangle. It was going North to South (which would have taken it over the Moline airport).  She ran in the house as soon as she first saw it, grabbed her camera and ran back out.  She snapped 3 pictures. I was about 30 seconds behind her and saw the triangle moving in the distance and then it just disappeared.
