Iam 41 now. I was 12 when this happened. It started out like a bright star, getting closer,in abought a 5 minute period, as I remember. It came down and hovered about 15 ft above the tree line.It was about 400 yards away from us. myself my two friends who were 12 and 15, and one set of parents. we watched it for about 10 minutes, as it went up and down 2 or 3 times. it was in line to the runway of Moline Illinois airport.A dirt road went through a cornfield where it was . To this day I cannot understand why of all places it would be in such an insignificant area. We were watching it from the trailor court where we lived. I could see the lights from it shine off the trees when it got close to them. The one thing That I do espically remember about it was the lights that continually revolved around it. I dont remember any colors. I was so scared , I remember running home crying to tell my mom. To this day I cant remember what happened after that.  I never walked down that road again, and will never forget that experience, the rest of my life.;41.4903459999999;-90.4968870000001
