My uncle, my mother and I were all coming home from Iowa City due to my father being in the hospital there at the time.  I was quite young, only 4, but I remember this craft hovering above near a group of apartment buildings off of John Deere Road in Moline, Illinois.  It had lights around it and my uncle was quite concerned.  My uncle had been interested in airplanes and knew that it had not been normal.  It kept moving up and down and in really odd zig-zag formations.  It was round. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));41.4903459999999;-90.4968870000001
