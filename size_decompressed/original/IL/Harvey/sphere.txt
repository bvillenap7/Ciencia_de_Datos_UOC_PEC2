Round sphere, was 90% translucent was siphoning electricity from high tension power-lines in the forest preserve.;2017-06-20 13:30:00;2 hours;A round sphere that was 90% translucent was siphoning electricity from high tension power-lines in the forest preserve.  There was a black suv on site with green and red lights flashing.  When i slowed down to stop and take a picture the suv blared a very loud siren and told me to keep moving.   Later that night a friend and myself were having a bonfire when we heard a loud guttural noise that we could not recognize coming from the forest.   As we went to go investigate we saw a very large shadow come through the tree line so we ran back inside.  That concludes the incident. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.
