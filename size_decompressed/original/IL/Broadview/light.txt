10 to 15 lights clustered in but unattached standing still in the sky;2012-09-23 00:10:00;3 minutes;10 to 15 lights clustered in but unattached standing still in the sky As my wife and i were coming home, once we reached the top of the bridge , i noticed some unusual lights in the sky about 10 to 15 standing still, they were individual lights in no particular formation, but grouped kinda close together but not attached to one another, there was another aircraft which appeared to be an aircraft but not like a commercial plane flying directly towards them to the East, once it got close and by the time we reached the bottom of the bridge and turn the corner towards our home, we could see the aircraft veering in a northerly direction but could no longer see the clusters of light even as we turned around to go back on the bridge to the west and then back towards  the east in the direction we first saw them. No its not something normal we see in the sky, this is the first time i have ever witnessed an even as such.;41.8597;-87.8612
