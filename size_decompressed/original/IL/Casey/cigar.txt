Crafts emit beams of what looks like smoke from their front end, and then follow these emissions;1997-07-07 12:00:00;8 min;Crafts emit beams of what looks like smoke from their front end, and then follow these emissions My dad, my brother, and I were on our way to a salvage yard in Casey, IL. One of us noticed a craft in the sky. It was note worthy because, instead of the craft emitting smoke from its tail end, it emitted the smoke from its front, and then followed that smoke. Two other craft in the vicinity were behaving the same way. We assume to this day that it was military experimental craft.  My dad is convinced that they were airplanes, and that's how my brother and I interpreted the craft at that time.  Thinking back, perhaps we processed these as airplanes only because we had no other exemplar to choose from.  I'd say that the craft were definitely the size of military airplanes, and they moved at a similar speed as airplanes, but I can't say that I know that they had wings like an airplane.  I assume they did have wings, only because we didn't make a mental note that they looked any different than airplanes.  The crafts were unlike average airplanes in that they seemed to communicate with each other in a unique way, spitting out these pillars of smoke and then randomly following them.   I don't remember their formation as this was 10 years ago. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));39.3054;-87.985
