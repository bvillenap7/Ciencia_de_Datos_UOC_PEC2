We live in the south suburb of Blue Island, my wife called me to the porch to view a low flying, cross shaped, aircraft (~19:30) with bright solid red light  ... coming from the south and heading northeast toward the Chicago loop, or over Lake Michigan area.   The craft made no sound - flying is a straight line ... probably about a house length or two apart with exception of the last three that came over ~ 5 minutes later.   The last one appeared to circle back to go south .    I recorded the flyover on my Samsung ... rather blurry images.;41.6574;-87.6797999999999
