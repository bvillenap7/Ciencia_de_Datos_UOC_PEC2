Red circular object surrounded by yellow glow flying w/no sound quickly coming out of east turning southbound;2012-10-11 22:15:00;45 seconds;Red circular object surrounded by yellow glow flying w/no sound quickly coming out of east turning southbound October 11, 2012  Dear UFO Center:  I think I just saw a UFO. While outside facing east at approximately 10:15 pm CST, I saw a small, circular red object slightly surrounded by a yellow light, flying westbound. While watching, this object turned southbound in an arc, slowed dramatically, then flew at a higher rate of speed southbound until out of my sight. I was standing on my small back porch with my back against the back door. The back door, as well as the back of my house, is white sided. There is a maple tree to my immediate south. The tree is approximately two-third bereft of its leaves. The remaining leaves on the tree are golden in color. This did not look like a private plane, kite, or laser light. It was red in color, circular in shape with a yellow haze surrounding it. It flew southbound until I could see it no more. If you call me from an 800-type telephone number, I do not answer anything I cannot identify.;41.6574;-87.6797999999999
