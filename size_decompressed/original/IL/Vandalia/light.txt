Bright red light at high speed.;2012-11-16 05:30:00;15 seconds;Bright red light at high speed I was standing beside my pickup getting my deer hunting gear together.  I looked to the north and saw a very bright red light going to the west at a very high speed.it was a little above the tree line and didnt seem more than a few miles away.it had no strobes or other flashing lights and i could hear no noise. When i first saw it, it was about halfway across the sky.it took about 15 seconds to finish crossing to the west and disappeared over the horizon.;38.9406;-89.1010000000001
Star moves after being stationary.;2013-12-27 17:30:00;10 minutes;Star moves after being stationary. I was walking across a field after dark after deer hunting. I stop frequently due to being overweight and look around.  During one of these stops I looked up overhead and to the northeast and watched an an aircraft flying from east to west.  Above it was a very bright light I thought was a star.  The light was stationary while watching the aircraft.  After a few minutes I started walking again.I got winded and stopped again a few minutes later and looked up to watch the aircraft and saw the star now moving at a good speed towards the southeast. I watched it til it faded from sight.  I have a set of Swarovski 10x binoculars(very good optics)and looked at the light thru them when I first saw it moving.  It was just a very bright white light with no shape.;38.9406;-89.1010000000001
