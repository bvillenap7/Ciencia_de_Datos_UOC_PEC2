Stationary triangular pulsing red lights seen in Irving, IL on 05/27/12 at 17:30 hours.;2012-05-27 17:30:00;10 minutes;Stationary triangular pulsing red lights seen in Irving, IL on 05/27/12 at 17:30 hours. I looked up into sky and saw a red triangular shaped, solid, and slightly pulsing light. At first I thought it was a plane coming to land at Lambert Airport in St. Louis but it wasn't moving and was too big to be a plane.  The lights were not the same as on a airplane getting ready to land.  I watched it for about four minutes until a text message came from my daughter. After I read her short text, I looked up and it was gone and nowhere to be seen. I live in the country where street lights, etc... so not ruin the view of the night sky.;39.2061;-89.4142
