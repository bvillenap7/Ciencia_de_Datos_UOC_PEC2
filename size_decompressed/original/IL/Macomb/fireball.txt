Flaming spherical object flying below cloud cover from east to west in a slow steady horizontal motion.;2009-09-06 21:00:00;45 seconds;Flaming spherical object flying below cloud cover from east to west in a slow steady horizontal motion. At 9pm on September 6, 2009 a friend and I spotted a spherical object in the sky, flying below cloud cover that appeared to be on fire.  We were facing south while watching the object move silently from east to west in a slow, steady, horizontal motion.  After about 45 seconds, the flames appeared to get dimmer and gradually go out. The object, if compared to a star in the night sky was about 10 times larger than the star.  We could clearly see flames however we were not able to determine what the object was.  Fearful that it was an aircraft on fire, I called the local police department.   The officer called the FAA and the air traffic control towers in Peoria and Chicago.  All aircraft on their radars were accounted for.;40.4591;-90.6805
