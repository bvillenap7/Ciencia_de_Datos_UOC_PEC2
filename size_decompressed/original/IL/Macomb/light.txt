It was spotted by a feeling my wife had. My wife called my name and showed me an airplane in the sky.  She just felt like showing it to me.  So I figured OK well I'll go get my binoculars and entertain her.  It was just a normal airplane.  So I tried looking at the airplane when she exclaimed well what is that?  It was a point of light that was changing in intensity.  It was about as bright at first as a planet in the sky.  It was approaching the airplane in the sky.  It changed angle slightly but flew mostly straight and became very dim till we could not see it.  It seemed to be heading 30 degrees south/west 0 deg = west.  It might have been following the airplane but we are not sure of the exact elevation.  Then it came back the other way also very dim and small such that we could barely make it out.  It looked to be retracing its previous path.  I remember exclaiming that it seemed unusual that it didn't have blinking lights like the air plane.  It was also white while it was bright but became o! range when it became dim and small.  To me from memory it was moving about 1.5 times faster than the airplane from our perception.  The airplane had 2 red flashing lights and heading south/west 12 degrees. 0 degrees being west.  The airplane was almost directly over head but a bit south.  Maybe 80 - 85 deg elevation by the time the unknown object was spotted heading back.;40.4591;-90.6805
Strange light in the sky and an odd Jet.  This is to fix the date of my origional report.;2011-08-17 08:41:00;2-3 min;Strange light in the sky and an odd Jet.  This is to fix the date of my origional report. My sighting I reported on 8/17/2011 in Macomb for this date for some reason has the wrong date of occurence.   It occured on 8/17/2011 not 8/17/2004.  It was sighted the date I posted.  I Thoght I would correct it but that dosn't seem possible so this is the next best solution that I know of. In some ways I wondered about how low that plane was flying also and how quiet it was.  I don't blieve we have any air planes normaly that fly that low over our city.  My wife and I both don't remember it making any noise. So maybe the airplane and the light we saw were connected.

I was loading the truck to go duck hunting for the weekend when I noticed a bright light in the sky through a tree.  The light brightened and then went dim.   Almost immediately after the first light dimmed a second light appeared higher in altitude than the first light.  It brightened and went dim.  I continued loading the truck and heard the sound of jets in the sky, about 15 minutes after seeing the lights.  There was a cloud cover that night and jets were lower than the clouds flying in circles as if searching.   While looking at the jets, I noticed about 8 lights flying in a straight line.  It appeared they were moving in a South to North direction.  The lights were too far apart to be a single object and they got really bright and dimmed suddenly just as the first two lights did.   The jets remained in the area for a few minutes, and I did not notice when they left as my grandfather and I got on the road, headed to the duck blind.;40.4591;-90.6805

There were two sets of these.  This continued across the sky for at least 2 minutes before disappearing completely.  There was no noise from it.;40.4591;-90.6805
