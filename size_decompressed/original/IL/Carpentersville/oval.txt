3 slanted white dots sitting there with no movement.;2012-05-23 20:39:00;2 mins.;3 slanted white dots sitting there with no movement. My boyfriend who was driving, my friend in the back seat, and i in the passenger seat were driving out of our complex . We were waiting to turn onto the highway when i noticed something in the sky. Looked like three slanted dots shaped in an oval formation. Tried taking a picture but we were already turning. Boyfriend tried saying it was a power line but it would have been blinking red lights and there has never been one there. decided to just take a picture when we got back because maybe it was my imagination. once we got back it was gone.
