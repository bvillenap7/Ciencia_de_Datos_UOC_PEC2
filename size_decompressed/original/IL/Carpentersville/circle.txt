Illinois Sky bright orange round object of light. Drone or UFO?;2012-10-31 20:00:00;2 minutes;Illinois Sky bright orange round object of light. Drone or UFO? Aprox 8:30 pm Wednesday evening I stepped out on the deck to grab some soda when I noticed a bright orange round object of light, moving slowly without any noise in the Northern sky.  It's outer edges brighter and almost flame like than the center. Traveling North to South it started to jump around in all directions as if trying to register  coordinates of some sort. With a large burst like streak, it traveled at an extreme rate towards airline flight path and as it traveled closer to one of the planes the illumination from the object suddenly dimmed to nothing.  The whole event lasted no longer than 2 min. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));42.1177;-88.2628
