There were three distinct lights at what appeared to be the corners, front light had a slight orange tinge and the others were soft yellow.  It took about 10 seconds to cross the middle two thirds of the sky we could see.  We had the radio on low but there was no loud drowning noises detected as you would expect from a chopper or fighter jet.  5 min later we got a better view of the horizon and noticed a couple of aircraft with the standard running lights moving paralell in the same direction about three miles apart and approximately 10,000 feet moving west soouthwest.  There is usually a lot of air trafic in the area anyway since O'Hare airport is only 15 miles away but these were definitely oddities especially the Pyramid shaped object.;42.1177;-88.2628
Unlit Triangular Flying Object in Night Sky;2012-02-11 18:15:00;60 sec;Unlit Triangular Flying Object in Night Sky Approximately 18:15 (6:15pm) in Carpentersville IL, while walking my dog, I saw an unlit object fly very quickly across the night sky. It was not lit up.  It was traveling across the sky from the North East direction to the South West direction.  I was able to keep my eye on it as it flew through the sky and faded into the distance. While the object was flying I compared it to other planes that were lit up in the sky.  The planes were much higher and had blinking lights. This object had none of that. The night was very cool, crisp and clear.  The stars were very visible as well as several planets.  The area I was walking the dog is dimly lit with yellow ornamental street lights.  I was approximately 100 ft. from the lights in a darker area so my night time vision was very clear. The object  appeared to be slate gray in color.  There was only 1 object.  I imagine I was the only one that saw it, although there was a steady stream of cars passing on the nearby road. (100 ft.). The object appeared to be shaped like a scalene triangle.  No noise accompanied the sighting.;42.1177;-88.2628
