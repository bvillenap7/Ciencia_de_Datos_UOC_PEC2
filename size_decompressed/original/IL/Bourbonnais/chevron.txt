Strange white triangular craft possibly military or not.;2003-11-21 19:00:00;about 2 minutes;Strange white triangular craft possibly military or not. I was having dinner and I noticed a strange airplane moving southward. It was flying lower than most of the planes from that direction usually do and higher than a helicopter. Thinking it was strange I stepped out on the back pourch. The flight path was heading directly above my house, which is unusual. It wasn't going as fast as most planes in my area go, do to the distance from the Chicago airports airports.  I watched this plane, which was silent, until it came right above me, and at that point all I heard was a shhhhhhh sound. Well, I could clearly see the bottom of the plane. It was a white trianglular craft with bright white lights on all three corners that didn't blink. The strange thing is it resembled (not exactly but similar) a stealth fighter. The tail section was not as notched out as a steath is, but it just looked similar. Anyway, as it went over, I knew I'd have to goto the front to watch it further south. I ran through the house to see in to the south and when I got there it was gone. It was still day light, there weren't any clouds in the sky, and nothing to obstruct my view. Also, the craft wasn't moving very fast as I watched it out back.  The craft looked like it could have been a military craft to me, although I have never seen a white craft like this on tv or the internet. I did some searching on the internet to try and find any documentation of such a craft and was unable to find that information.;41.1683;-87.8779
