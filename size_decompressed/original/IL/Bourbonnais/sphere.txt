In Bourbonnais, IL, two friends and I were sitting on the curb outside.  It was 1:38 in the morning and we were not under the influence of intoxicants of any sort. It was a clear night with no clouds in the sky.  A bright object appeared in the sky and we all saw a bright purple and green ball shoot through the sky at a very high speed.  It resembled a ball of plasma. It appeared to be close to the ground but not knowing size, it is hard to judge. It had what appeared to be a steam-like trail (similar to that of a jet) but had a glowing quality.  The trail was erratic and began and ended at definite points.  The object appeared for a second and disappeared the same as it appeared.  The trail stayed in the sky for close to four seconds and then disappeared at once. It did not dissipate from one end to the other.  It was not a shooting star, or meteor.   It was nothing like any of us have ever seen and strongly resembled the sighting from Naperville, IL.;41.1683;-87.8779
