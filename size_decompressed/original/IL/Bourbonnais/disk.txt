It must have been summer and we both believe it was 1978 as we have a tragedy as a point of reference. We saw an orange/red colored saucer shaped object in the sky which appeared to hover for a few minutes. Then it began moving side to side and up and down then paused there. I stayed in the sky for what seemed like 10 or 15 minutes. Then it shot off into the western horizon.As the object moved into the horizon it looked like sunset for a few seconds.
