My family has seen 50+ UFO's south of Bourbonnais Illinois.  They described them at Orange lights that were in a straight line that moved in unison.  My stepfather has called the local police station and they have gotten multiple reports of people saying the same thing, though cloud cover has caused them to disappear.;41.1683;-87.8779
