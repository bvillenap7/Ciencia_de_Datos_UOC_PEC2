As I was driving the glare from the sun off of an round object in the sky caught my eye, I looked over at the object sitting north west over the bourbonnais area, it was Blue in color and it sat in the sky in the same place for about 30 seconds to a minute befor it moved north west at a unkown speed it had to be at least 15-20 miles if not more in 3 seconds, it became a white dot in the sky,  I couldn't believe how fast it had dashed away, when it had been sitting in the sky it appeared to be a metalic blue.

We saw 2 balls of white/yellow light in the sky, one disappeared while the other moved further away out of sight.;2013-06-16 19:00:00;10 minutes;We saw 2 balls of white/yellow light in the sky, one disappeared while the other moved further away out of sight. My family, two friends, and I saw 2 round shaped objests in the sky while we were sitting outside our house at around 7pm on June 16th.  We got out our binoculars to get a better look at them and they were 2 balls of white/yellow light and we watched them as they moved closer to each other for about 4 minutes until one disappeared, we watched the other one for about 6 more minutes as it was moving further away.  Everyone took a turn looking through the binoculars and agreed that they were 2 balls of white/yellow light and definitely not a plane or anything we had seen before.;41.1683;-87.8779
