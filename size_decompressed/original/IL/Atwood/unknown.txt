something overhead causes house to shake;2001-03-15 22:00:00;2 minutes;something overhead causes house to shake I've just read a report from Taylorville, Illinois back in March. I am not sure of dates and times. Especially the times. It could be much later. Past midnight. Helicopters have flown over our house at night, on a pretty regular basis, as there are National Guard helicopters at the airport in Decatur. However, over the past few months (I do not know the dates) the house has been shaken quite violently, 3 times. I'd assumed it was helicopters that had, for some reason, started flying lower than usual. (Which I'm assuming is a no-no over residential areas, though I didn't call anyone to complain.) The first extra-loud fly-over (late February or early March) lasted several minutes. The windows rattled for quite some time (more than one but perhaps not 2 full minutes) before the helicopter was heard. I didn't even think helicopter until it was over. I cannot actually say that these loud ones are helicopters because of all the extra noise. i.e. I know what a helicopter sounds like as I hear them quite often but the extra noise of the house shaking was so loud that I couldn't swear it was a helicopter that flew over. There have been 2 others, a couple of weeks apart. And the time between when the windows begin to rattle and the source of the vibration is heard is very short. That first one was strange because the house shook and simply kept shaking for no apparent reason. I will definitely pay more attention and record the times, duration and what, if anything, I can see.;39.8;-88.4451
