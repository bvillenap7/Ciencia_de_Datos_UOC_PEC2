String of lights in the night sky;2020-12-04 18:00:00;1 minute;String of lights in the night sky I walked outside in the back yard and looked up and noticed a string of lights approximately 20 or more and  they were white in color and in a straight formation. I'm not sure but I would say that they were approximately 40 feet or more in between each of them. I did not hear any noise from them and ran in to get my wife who also witnessed this. I grabbed my iPad and tried to record it but it was unsuccessful. Soon after the lights rose up and vanished out of sight.;38.7309999999999;-90.1097000000005
