TRIANGLE CRAFT IN ILLINOIS STRIKES AGAIN;2000-11-18 18:45:00;less than a minute;TRIANGLE CRAFT IN ILLINOIS STRIKES AGAIN I am also 1/2 the party that submitted the follwoing report :     ((URL address deleted lists NUFORC report)). Since that report I always pay careful attention to the skies.  I want to see what I seen that night, nobody belives my friend ((name deleted)) and I about what we saw.  We were scared and we left that night after seeing that, we didn't bother to stop.  I regret that.  Well this past Saturday my girlfriend was driving to collinsville to make her carpayment.  She drove and while on horseshoe lake road I glanced over in the general aarea where our first sighting happened to be.  I saw the exact same thing!!!  My girlfriend didn't look and got scared but I was fine.  We were only about 4 miles away from my original sighting.  On Sunday after the sighting me and my friend kyle went to see this area.  To see if there was anything at all we could find to support my sighting.  We didn't find anything.  But we did see something I think you and everybody would be very interested to know.  The name of the farm near our sighitng is called secret acres.  In fact the man was very cautious about letting us near the sights.  I did research and there used to be an old air field in that area as well.  THANK YOU;38.7309999999999;-90.1097000000005
