Cigar sgaped (Oblong) Obejct seen hovering over Eastern Illinois;2004-07-26 13:00:00;15 minutes;Cigar sgaped (Oblong) Obejct seen hovering over Eastern Illinois My husband and I were traveling out of town with our children on Monday, July 26, 2004. We were leaving St. Louis, East on HWY 270, which was to a crawl going over the bridge from Missouri to Illinois because of road construction. We were at slow pace for at least 15 minutes (Approximately 12:44 pm CDT) , and maybe went five miles during this time. My husband noticed an object in the sky in the distance. The object appeared to be hovering in the same location. It was obviously not a plane because it appeared to be in the same position the whole time. It was too large to be a helicopter from our viewing distance. It was oblong in shape. It is possible it could have been a blimp given the large size.  I took pictures and submitted via email. I am not sure how long the object remained as traffic finally broke free and we continued to out of town.;38.7309999999999;-90.1097000000005
