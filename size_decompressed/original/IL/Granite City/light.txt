Fourth of july celebration.;1997-07-04 21:15:00;15 minutes;Summary : Fourth of july celebration. We was watching the firework celebration, approx. 21:15.   A few minutes into the event, a blueish green light come from the east to the west.  Looks like it wasn't much higher than the big aerial display.  It flew almost into the fireworks and was gone.  We only seen it for about a second or two. It was pretty neat.  I imagine alot more people there saw it but I dont know.  Thank you.;38.7309999999999;-90.1097000000005
A blue-green light moved so fast across the sky I had to turn my head to keep up with it.;1997-07-04 22:00:00;3-4 seconds;Summary : A blue-green light moved so fast across the sky I had to turn my head to keep up with it. On 7/4/97 after lighting off or last fireworks as our last bit of ash fell,another witness and myself saw a blue-green lite move across a large field of view in the sky then disappeard at impossiable speed!!    The lite was Tri-shaped with the brightess part beeing the top and bottom. It appeard as if it was sitting with the lights off then turned them on and moved at the same time. It was under the clouds because the lite from it reflected off the clouds like lighting does. It then move so fast in my field of view I had to turn my head to keep up with it.  It wasn't moving downward or upward it looked as if it was moving straight across the sky. We ran in to tell my girlfriend and our friend and they were like it's the 4th of July,It was prob. a rocket.. I said No way, then on Tues.7/8/97(today) the friend who didn't believe said she heard about it on the radio this morning that other people saw it..  It's been on the news and someone has a video tape of it that they played. They reported that as many as 200 people called in to report it..   my name is ((name deleted)) I'm 21years old. The other witness was a 14 year old boy named ((name deleted)), another person was outside at the time and they just happend to be looking down and missed it..  I still get goose bumbs,It was amazing!!~~;38.7309999999999;-90.1097000000005
One large, orangeish light seen initially during thunder storm. Another similar light appeared a good distance away.;1999-04-08 22:30:00;25 minutes;One large, orangeish light seen initially during thunder storm. Another similar light appeared a good distance away. During a severe thunderstorm, I looked out my office window to the West and observed a singular, very bright, orangeish light above the horizon. I have noticed a similar light there before, and thought it to be a planet. However, we were now in the midst of a strong thunderstorm, and there were no other lights to be seen. I went outside to get my binocculars, and to search the sky thouroughly in an effort to verify that there were no other lights to be seen. There weren't, and I became very curious about this one. I went back inside to continue to observe this light. As I was watching, Another light instantly appeared a fair distance away from the first one. This second light was identical in every observable detail. The only exception was that this one began to move slowly upward. It stopped for a while, and then it moved again to left. I was periodically observing this light with my binocculars, and After it had moved as described, it then stopped. Now It seemed to have other features. It seemed to have length, because it had other lights on it that allowed me to discern that it wasn't simply a glowing ball. the first ligh is still stationary at this point. The storm began to subside, and the sky cleared up. I went outside to get a better view. The second object began to drift away, until it was out of view entirely. Then, to the right of the first object, another light apeared. Very bright, and it was drifting east, (toward my viewpoint) then it stopped for about 10 seconds. The light that it was eminating was more white than orange, and as I observed it through my binocculars, the light, which resembled a spotlight to me, seemed to become more foccused in my direction, as if the craft was rotating slightly. It then began to move again, and proceeded to fly almost directly over my head. (However, these objects were not close at all, and it was very difficult to view any details) The only description I can give you is that it seemed to be rather long, based, again, on the lights I was observing on the craft. This object drifted out of view. When I turned my attention back to the first light, The one I first saw durring the storm, I noticed a much more interesting flying craft: Seen without the binocculars, it very much ressembled the other lights (Bright Glowing Ball) With the binocculars I observed Five lights associated with this craft: It seemed to be a rectangular object, Very large, with white lights at each corner, and a blinking red light in the middle. It seemed to be flying a large holding pattern over an area where there would be no reason to do this. (No Airport) I observed it repeating this pattern twice. Then it disapeared. The first light was no longer vissible when I went back upstairs. I don't know what all of this was, and I realize that it may be very explainable. But I have never observed such a display. I don't know what was hovering about, but I would love to speak to anyone else who saw this.;38.7309999999999;-90.1097000000005
