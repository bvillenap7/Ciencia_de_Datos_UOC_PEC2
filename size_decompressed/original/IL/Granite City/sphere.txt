We were sitting in the yard when we noticed what we thought was a sky writer plane  but as we watched, it changed into a glowing blue ball that as it pulsated it got bigger, it was in the western sky and we were gauging its movement by the electric wires, it moved erratically  and as it got to it's biggest point, it became pink and then started getting smaller and further up  in the sky until it just dissapeared. We were  mesmerized, but I just got a computer and didn't know of anywhere I could disciss it until now. I would appreciate any information anyone haas had on a similiar experience. Thank You...;38.7309999999999;-90.1097000000005
