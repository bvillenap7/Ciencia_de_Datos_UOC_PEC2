pin point of light hovering, then speeding off and just disapearing.;2000-11-11 21:00:00;45 seconds;pin point of light hovering, then speeding off and just disapearing. I was walking alone down the street behind my parents home.  It was cold outside, I beleive, I can't even remember when at all it hapened except it was dark.  All the sudden I just looked up.  I was already nervous beeing a female alone at night, though the towne was small.  I looked up and there was this light in the sky a white light like a star, but different.  I knew it was different, I just looked at it and felt like it was looking at me too.  All of the sudden it took off. just so darn fast, from still to speed of light, w/ in what looked like at the distance it was to be an inch or two it disapeared.  Poofed, vanished.  I had a simaler experience years later, it was in 03' maybe, but this time it was in the country closer to Mattoon, which is 10 miles from Charleston.  Anyway, there it is.
