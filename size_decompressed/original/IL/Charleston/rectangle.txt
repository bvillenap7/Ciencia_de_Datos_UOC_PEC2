A light silver rectangle aircraft moved silently north to northwest on the northwest edge of Charleston.  The crows in the area were cawing loudly at the object as it slowly flew over.   The color of the aircraft wasn't a normal silver or gray airplane hue.  It was quite pretty with what appeared to be a sparkle in the sunlight.;39.4849;-88.1805000000001
