3FT TRANSLUCENT OBJECT LEAVES 10 FT CONTRAIL;2004-06-11 15:30:00;2 MINS;3FT TRANSLUCENT OBJECT LEAVES 10 FT CONTRAIL WAS WORKING SAW FLASH OF LIGHT ABOUT 150 YARDS AWAY ALONG A TREE LINE AND CORN FIELD. I KEEP BINOS IN MY TRUCK TO VIEW DEER. I WATCHED OBJECT ABOUT 3 FT LONG MAKING CIRCLES UNDER TREE LINE . i THOUGHT MAYBE AN OPTICAL ILLUSION WITH THE BINOS, HEAT, AND SUNLIGHT. THE MOST INTERESTING PART WAS THE CONTRAIL IT LEFT BEHIND. I COULD SEE HOW I COULD MAYBE SEE A REFLECTION IN THE BINOS, BUT THIS CONTRAIL WAS ABOUT 10-12 FEET LONG, I COULD SEE IT DISAPATE. THE OBJECT WAS A TRANSLUCENT WHITE AND BLUE. I WALKED OVER TO AREA AFTER IT WAS GONE, FOUND THIS LONG STRINGY COTTONY SUBSTANCE.;39.4849;-88.1805000000001
