Four unique objects form a rectangle in the western skies of Chicago.;2007-09-12 21:45:00;twenty minutes;Four unique objects form a rectangle in the western skies of Chicago. It was approximately 9:45, I happened to glance in the western skies. I am located in the Burbank area (southwest of Chicago). I noticed one very bright light while looking toward the west, it was south as well. I then noticed a blinking light just past the very bright light which seemed to be moving in a north to south fashion. As I glanced directly west, I had noticed two other lights, one was located over some trees in the neighborhood, this one had a very odd flicker, like none I have ever seen before. I am accustomed to planes and seeing stars, this one was unlike anything I have seen before.  My fiance had noticed this one starting to move. Also, there was another flickering light in the vast distance which seemed to flurry in and out of our sight horizon. This one definitely was moving back and forth in a north to south manner. It was exceedingly odd. I have seen some odd things, but standing back, I seemed to have had four unidentified objects that seemed to form a rectangle. Again, they consisted of one VERY bright stationery light, two objects that seemed to hover north to south, and one light that had a very UNIQUE flicker to it. It was a very breathtaking and odd experience. I confirmed that I was not crazy when my fiance had taken notice to the exact same experience I had encountered.;41.7402;-87.7723000000001
