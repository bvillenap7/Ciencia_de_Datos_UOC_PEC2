Not experimental aircraft because it disappeared;2015-07-23 16:50:00;25 seconds;Not experimental aircraft because it disappeared I was driving and saw a hazey white boomarang-shaped object flying with sun glaring off it sometimes.  It was standing tall while flying.  It had a little boomerang shape in it and triangle to it.  The top of the boomarang was a little bit longer than the bottom.  It sorta was featureless.  It kinda reminded me of an Angelfish with a longer fin on top than the bottom but had a triangle body with no tail.  The top fin was slightly in a diffent angle from the smaller bottom fin. The hazey look to it made it look blurry.   I was driving on Cicero looking on the side of Best Buy towards Midway Airport, when I noticed it.  I got my camera ready and stuck my arm out when I was parked at a red light.  It disappeared right before the second I took the picture like it knew to disappear before I would of got a picture of it.  I made a drawing of it on my Wii U art program and posted it on Facebook.  I have the photo I took on my cellphone showing a Best Buy Sign right before it disappeared.  It look to be as big as a small passenger plane but was super taller like an angelfish.  It was almost like watching if like a angelfish if it was flying in the sky but an angelfish wouldn't have sun glaring off it sometime.  I was thinking it was an experimental aircraft, at first, until it disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
