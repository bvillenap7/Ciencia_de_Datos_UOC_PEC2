It seemed to hear what we were talking about.;1972-06-01 22:00:00;30 min;It seemed to hear what we were talking about. we were driving on a country road at night, it was clear and warm out, we had the sunroof open when I noticed a flashing light off in the distants. At first I thought it was just a plane, but noticed it was covering a lot distance in short amount of time. I told my 2 friends, as we talked more about what we were watching we wanted to follow it. As we were talking we noticed that it started to get closer. It came along side us above a corn feild, it had 3 lights in a triangle,they flashed on and off at the same time. They flashed very bright they did not fade they were on then black. We couldn't see an object just the lights. It followed us along the road 100 yrds away. We slowed down, it slowed down, we sped up it did the same. We stoped it did also. We then shut the lights off and it stoped flashing. We then turned the lights back on and it started flashing again. We then turned the engine off, we could hear no sound of the object, it just flashed on and off with no sound. By now we were scared out of mineds. We decided to go back to town, as we did this the object stoped following us, like it could hear what we were saying. At some point we became brave and decided to go back after it but it seamed to start following the railroad tracks until we couldn't see it any more. We returned to the same place for a week but never say it again, and we quite telling our story. No one belived us. Even to this day I only tell very close friends. I know what I say! ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  A celestial body--a star or a planet--will appear to a person driving that it is following his car.  However, unless the object is a twinkling star, or a tumbling rocket booster in orbit, it will not appear to blink.  PD));42.2698;-89.2393
