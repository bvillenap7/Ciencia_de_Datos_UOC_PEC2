I was traveling north on rt. 83 leaving grayslake Illinois heading towards round lake Illinois.  i looked to my left Western sky's and had noticed to perfect balls of light. they were bright orange only a few hundred feet off of the ground like a normal flight ceiling for single engine prop planes.  it was maybe a quarter mile from my direction and there were 2 orange sphere lights maybe 100 feet apart from each other no movement just hovering i stopped my car and got out by the time i turned my camcorder on my phone on the one orange ball faded away which looked like to be in some clouds (which it was and still is a CLEAR night) for the record. i then turned my recorder on and was filming the other orange ball giving my location and what i am looking at. the video is clean and you can see the orange ball on it and vanished which that's what it did. i was watching the 2nd one and it started to move or descend down a bit and then flicker and i noticed this clou! d glow around it and then it vanished then came back for a second then it was gone. and that was it. My friend (T) also saw very close to the same thing almost a month ago 2 orange lights hovered then went into these clouds and vanished she also reported her sighting on here. and she also saw it in Round lake not even a month ago. is this a coincidence ?;42.3667;-88.0924999999999
