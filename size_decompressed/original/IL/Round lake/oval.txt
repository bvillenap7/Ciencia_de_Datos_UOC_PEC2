An hour into enjoying our time, I looked up and noticed a solid white oval in the sky.  It sat still, until another one appeared from behind the clouds, moving slowly across the sky.  We could identify 3 planes in the sky, none of which looked like the ovals.   The ovals began floating around, at one point very close to each other.  Sometimes they would shine so bright it hurt my eyes, but for the most part they just looked white.  The first one began flying away, until I could no longer see it.  Soon after, the other flew off into the same direction. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of the report elects to remain anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));42.3667;-88.0924999999999
