Seen a Planet or bright star shaped white object moving fast- West of Chicago 05/05/16 2100 Hrs. I was just looking at the stars in my back yard on 05/06/16 at 21:00 Hrs.  In Round Lake, IL, a suburb Northwest of Chicago. My yard is facing the West Sky.  I saw what I thought was planet or bright star that was traveling from the south heading in a straight North to slight North West direction. The object was in my sky view for about 10 seconds.  I thought it could be the Space Station.  There was no flashing lights, just solid white.  I could also see aircraft in the area and it was much larger then the planes. It was located at approximately a 90 degree angle up from my standing posistion in the West Sky. To reference the location, I checked sky map and when I point my tablet up it would be coming from the location of the Cancer Constellation as high up as the top star in this area.   Also, M44 is about the same height up from my view. I checked space station info, and it's not going to be in the area until Sunday. I did not hear any sounds and I did not see it lose any altitude. I have seen meteors before coming down at an angle, this was not losing altitude it stayed in a straight line heading straight North to slight North West. I am not an expert but am I am a retired Police Officer and I have observed many things over the years at night.  I have not seen a Planet sized object traveling very fast across the sky before.
