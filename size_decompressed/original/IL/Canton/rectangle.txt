They came from a northwest sky moving to the southeast. They had an orange-yellow glow. The wide side of the object was the leading edge (like they were moving sideways). The space between the two objects appeared to be 2 to 3 times their length. There was no sound and they moved at a medium rate of speed until they were out of sight.;40.5594;-90.0237
