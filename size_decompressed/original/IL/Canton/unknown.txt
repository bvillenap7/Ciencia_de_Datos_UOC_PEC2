2 green lights traveling subsonic with no sound;2011-04-09 23:00:00;10sec;2 green lights traveling subsonic with no sound It was flying south from canton toward farmington.  Two green lights traveling faster than any aircraft I have seen in the army.  There was no sound.  This sounds crazy. I've been texting tonight and other people saw this same thing from other locations.  This is a legit sighting.  Not that it matters but you wouldn't be chasing a false claim.;40.5594;-90.0237
