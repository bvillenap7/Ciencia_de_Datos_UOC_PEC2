A large black triangle with 3 lights was seen outside of Canton, Illinois on 5-1-06.;2006-05-01 22:15:00;4 min.;A large black triangle with 3 lights was seen outside of Canton, Illinois on 5-1-06. I was driving home from work at approximately 10:15pm on May 1, 2006, when I noticed a large object that appeared to be hovering about 20 meters above the tree line north of  the road that I was driving on.  The object was very large I would guess it to be about the size of a very large jumbo jet.  It was shaped like an isosceles triangle, with steady blue-white lights positioned at each of the points. The object seemed to be black in color and not extremely thick for its size, I would guess it to have been about 6-8 meters in thickness.  The most unusual characteristic of the object was a marked lack of engine noise.  I stopped the car, and got out to watch the object. I observed the object for about four minuets at about half a football fieldâ€™s distance during which time the object slowly moved North East at seemingly moderate and steady pace, still without any real engine noise except a slight whirring noise.  I then returned to my car and went home unshaken by the experience but contemplating the unusualness of what I had just witnessed.  As far as my background goes, I am a thirty year old male who works retail. I also have a teaching degree in history education from a four year university and work as a substitute teacher in the area.;40.5594;-90.0237
