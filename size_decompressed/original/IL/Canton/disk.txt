It appeared to be tall but shaped more like like a half circle.  ((NUFON report)) Observer was working as a delivery driver heading back to the store going south on 4th Street.  In the top of his field of vision something shinny slowly formed in the air out of nothing.  It sat for about 5-10 seconds then just faded out just as it had faded in.   There where no clouds and nothing else visible in the sky except for one airplane (jet) about 20 miles west and was able to identify it because of the contrails.   The UFO he saw had no contrails of any kind and was so shiny it was almost blinding.  It appeared to be tall but shaped more like like a half circle.;40.5594;-90.0237
