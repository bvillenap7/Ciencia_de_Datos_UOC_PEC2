Triangle Ufo flying down 1115th st. Alsip ,IL 2004;2004-06-30 22:30:00;a few mintues;Triangle Ufo flying down 1115th st. Alsip ,IL 2004 I was driving E/on 115th St. approaching Cicero ave..  In the distance I saw lights in the sky very low . I thought to my self that weird Ive never seen a plane fly that low.  As the lights got closer it wasnt a plane at all.  I observed a very large triangle ufo with 6 light's on the bottom of the craft the thing flew right over my car while I was driving.   It  was a warm night out so I had my car window open and the object didn't make any noise and flew very straight and low.   It's taken me awhile to tell anyone because people wouldnt believe me . I'm a police officer but was in my personal car coming home from a friend's house.    After the object went over my car I looked ahead and saw all the traffic heading N/S bound on cicero someone else had  to see the thing.
