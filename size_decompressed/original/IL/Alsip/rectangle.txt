As I was driving south bound on Cicero Avenue near 103rd Street in Oak Lawn, Illinois,  I saw a gray elongated retangular gray object about 5 miles further south in the sky moving from the east towards the west.  It was about 22.50 degrees above the horizon.  It was moving much slower then an airplane, and I thought it could be a blimp, but it moved faster than a blimp, and the ends were not rounded like a blimp.   A helicopter could move at that speed, but its shape in no way resembled a helicopter.;41.6751;-87.732
