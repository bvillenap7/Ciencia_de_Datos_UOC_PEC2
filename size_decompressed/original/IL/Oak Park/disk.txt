Within the flash  was a disk  shaped prism of rainbow colors. I was locking up my garage at 9:00 in the evening.Sept 4th.2007. I heard a strangehumming sound coming from the top of the tree line, so it made me look up. Suddenly off to the right, I saw a brilliant white flash. Contained within the flash was an oval disk. The disk was filled with clear vertical rainbow stripes like a prism. It was dazzling in the intensity. The rainbow rays extended outward from the shape but they were softer, hazier... Then bam! it was gone. It's hard to say how close it was. The humming sounded fairly close, but the flash of colors seemed much higher. The oval shape could have been covered up with quarter, and the total flash with a tennis ball(to give you an idea of perspective.) The whole thing lasted only a few seconds 3 at most.And to be clear, I didn't actually see a metallic structure of a disk. It was a clearly defined disk of light with very defined vertical stripes like a prism. There may be a natural way to explain this, but it was definitely startling to see this. It could be light refracting off something, but it lasted a long time, and coupled with the strange noise. I don't usually give the idea of ufo's much thought, and I don't go looking for this kind of thing. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.
