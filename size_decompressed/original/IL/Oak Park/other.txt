The first with 3 lobes, the second a rectanglular object with light at front. 18:30 6/25, Oak Park, IL. In the sky to the north, moving due east to west was an object which glinted in the sun. It was a clear night, just some high clouds. With  7 x 50 binoculars the object clearly  consisted of 3 parts. A leading round part with, on either side, as if being dragged by wires (which were visible), two similar round objects (almost as if it were an obeject with two parachutes, or a gondola with two balloons). Movement was very steady with no vapor trail. In the binocular the size, compared to just eye vision, was multiplied about 4x. At 19:05 another obeject appered which seemed to be a metallic object glinting in the setting sun. In the binoculars it appeared to be an object such as debris (asteroid or dead satellite) which was burning up on entry. The glinting might have been as it rotated, and was on fire, or had a shiny side which was catching the sun. Closer inspection made it seem that rather than rotating, it was moving from left to right and that it had a headlight. This object seemed rectangular. No other markings or light could be made out. Moving east to west, no vapor trail. Finally, coincidence or not, I tried calling numbers in the local yellow pages for air traffic control (O'Hare), IL national air guard, and FAA, to find out what I might have seen, and all numbers were wrong, or disconnected.;41.8884659090909;-87.7898397727273
