When i looked back at him the star seemed to be there but rising upwords towards the sky more and more until eventually it was out of sight in the window. We both ran to the back door and watched it rise more and more then proceed to run in and tell our father which didn't seem to believe us. We then just brushed it off as possibly a figment of our imagitions. Then a few days later driving home from a basketball game we again saw that same star in the same place. we looked at each other and then watched it rise with in 10 min. of spotting it. i then was talking to a friend the following day and he claimed he saw the same thing that i had described, rather it be a real UFO or just a airplane, all i know is that it freaked us out!!!!;41.6305;-89.95
