IL.;2009-08-15 15:00:00;10 seconds;A silver/bright round/disk object flying at a high rate of speed in an irregular path at a high altitude in a cloudy sky over N. IL. I was a passenger in a SUV on a country road between Rock Falls, IL and Prophetstown, IL. I think the date was August 15th, 2009-give or take a couple days. It was very cloudy for several days in a row. That particular day there were large fluffy couds -some dark rain clouds, others white- some sat low, while others were very high in the sky....I think there was a cold front. In between some clouds I could see slices of blue sky in a few areas. When I looked up at one slice of blue, a very shingy round/oval/disk object darted accross the sky on a sort of hair-brained odd path that was wavy (almost the way one hops accross stones on a creek). It would be straight one minute, then changing direction like it was changing its mind. It was extremely high in the sky and would be hidded for a moment here or there as it flew above the clouds. It did not look or act like any plane or man-made vehicle I had seen, but it was flying at a high rate of speed it seemed and! , as I mentioned, almost irradically or at least, in an irregular fashion from the way planes fly, particularly considering its high altitude. I eventually lost track of it when cloud cover blocked my view. I will never forget seeing it that day.;41.6305;-89.95
