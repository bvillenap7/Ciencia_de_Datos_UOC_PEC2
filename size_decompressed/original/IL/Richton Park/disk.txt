I was young, excited about the following day's events.   Around 11 I finally drifted asleep, only to be woken up a few hours later by a bright, pale-blue glow coming through the blinds of the window beside my bed.  Being a child, I figured it was the blue sky of morning.   I stood and pulled my blinds up as I did every morning.  When I did I was greeted not by the sky I'd been expecting, but by the dark night sky.  I looked around for the source of the light, and not finding it, I went to get a glass of water.  I figured I'd imagined it.  When I came back to bed the light was back, and this time I could see the source.  There was a large, saucer-shaped craft in the sky above the forest behind my house.  It looked almost transparent in the center, and glowed blue around the edges, looking almost jellyfish-like.  I stared for a few minutes, stupefied.  As I watched, the center pulsed yellow and! came closer to my window.  I tapped the glass, I don't recall why, but when I did it pulsed purple very quickly five times and took off.  I dove into my bed and tightened the covers around me, something about the craft filled my chest with cold fear ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.
