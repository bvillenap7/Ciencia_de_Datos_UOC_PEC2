We were driving East on Sauk Trail when I noticed a spherical, extremely bright, white reflective-looking light in the sky ahead of us that seemed to be pulsating.  I would compare the color of the light to the color of a white LED light.   I started recording with my phone.  It did not appear to be moving, but rather, hovering.  We watched/filmed it for just about a minute and then it just disappeared.  It did not seem to fly up, down or to either side it just vanished.  I only saw one.   Once you press play, zoom in to see it better.  Myself, my fiancé and our 9 year old son were present during this event.  I am always looking at the sky to see if I can spot anything interesting, and my fiancé was driving, so I had the opportunity to record it.;41.4787;-87.7267
