bright orange light in sky hovers and disappears;2008-04-29 22:15:00;2 minutes;bright orange light in sky hovers and disappears I was walking through a park and I noticed what appeared to be an airplane at first.  The sky was clear, and there were no trees or anything else in the sky near the object.   It was between one and two miles away, and it was long enough to be an airplane.  It had no blinking lights like an airplane, but it had a solid pale orange/red light that was bright enough to be an airplane light, and what appeared to be windows. It did not appear to be moving.  As I kept walking, it disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  The witness indicates a date in the future.  We assume that the correct date is 04/29/2008, and we have amended it to reflect such.
