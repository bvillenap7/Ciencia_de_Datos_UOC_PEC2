The other important  fact is that O-hare  airport is obout where it was going over.;42.0406515463917;-87.8855711340208

I let him out and he ran to the back chainlink fence, looking up and barking, I looked and saw a dark object about 40 feet away, 20 feet off the ground. It made no sound, daylight did not reflect off it, it was sort of round at the top and square at the bottom, it was small, about 4 feet high by 3 feet wide, it was just sitting there in the air, sort of twisting slowly, as soon as I thought  I have to get my camera it bent backwards and started to ascend up, slow at first , then quickly, till it entered a cloud bank, but I could see it as a small black dot, it just sat there for a while, then was gone. It seemed to be examining the large Petroleum tanks for the airport fuel cache.;42.0406515463917;-87.8855711340208
Black Helicopter over house.;2010-08-14 10:00:00;20 min;Black Helicopter over house. I am reporting a strange incident that wasn't a ufo exactly. Here is the story. Around 10 pm my son and I see a strange four legged creature cross the road we were on. It looked to have a round head (no ears sticking up and no distinctive jaw) and it had a gait like a racoon. It was the size of a very large dog around 90 pounds. On Aug 14 2010 (about two weeks later) a black helicopter is looking for something just feet above our house. It stays there and nearby for about 20 minutes. About 2 hours later it came back and did the same thing. That Saturday night we heard a pitiful cry sounding like fear and despair. Like when an animal gets caught. It sounded like it was only blocks away to the west of us and will haunt me for a long time. Sunday morning about 11 am we heard two military B 52s leaving O'Hare. We first heard them (military aircraft are real loud) and went outside to see. It was clear what they were. So, anybody else see,hear or notice something that day? I can't find anything locally about it.;42.0406515463917;-87.8855711340208
