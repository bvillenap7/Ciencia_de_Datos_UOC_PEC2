As it traveled  over my head I noticed another stationary orange orb through the tree top blinking. I of course didn't have my phone to capture it on video. As it traveled I lost sight of it over our roof, so I ran to my back door because I was sure I would see it still moving through the night sky, but it was unfortunately gone, so ran  ack to where I initially witnessed it and the stationary one was gone and I have been baffled with what I saw. I am very familiar with commercial and military craft. What I saw was not a traditional aircraft. It was completely silent and did not have any flashing indicator lights. I will keep watching the night sky in hopes of witnessing it again.;42.0406515463917;-87.8855711340208
