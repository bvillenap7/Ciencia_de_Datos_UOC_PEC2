While taking out the trash early in the morning, I happened to glance up towards the northeast and noticed a circular object traveling at a high rate of speed due south. No lights, just a circular grey object moving quick.  It was out of my view behind trees after about 20 seconds.;42.0406515463917;-87.8855711340208
