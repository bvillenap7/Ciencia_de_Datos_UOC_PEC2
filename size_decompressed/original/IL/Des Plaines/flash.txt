Witness 30 star-like lights, appearing from southwest sky, travelling in convoy, evenly spaced.  ((Starlink satellites));2020-03-06 19:35:00;5 minutes;Witness 30 star-like lights, appearing from southwest sky, travelling in &quotconvoy,&quot evenly spaced, same speed and northeast di March 6, 2020, 7:35pm, Des Plaines, IL  60016 Saw about 30 evenly spaced star-like lights traveling at same speed from southwest sky, from underneath the brightest star in the West, traveling east-to-northeast over north side of Chicago (from my backyard in suburb, Des Plaines).  None of them had colored or blinking lights, like you would see from a commercial aircraft.  Instead, they were steady lights, much like moving stars.  They looked like the occasional satellites that I used to see in the Northwoods except there was a long string, a convoy.  I took some video.  It was about 7:35pm when I saw the first of about thirty.  Only two were close together.  The other 28, or so, were evenly spaced apart traveling exactly same speed and in the exact same direction and appearing from the exact same place in the southwestern sky – one after another.  Hard to gauge their size or altitude or speed except they were travelling much higher than the commercial air traffic from O’Hare airport.  I see a lot of airplanes in the sk! y here near O’hare, at all altitudes.  Never, ever saw anything like these.  They were not commercial passenger aircraft, I am certain of that.;42.0406515463917;-87.8855711340208
