10 shapes were flying about a mile outside of Ohare field.;2002-10-05 16:30:00;15 minutes;10 shapes were flying about a mile outside of Ohare field. At about 4:30 pm my wife was getting our kids in the car to leave when we heard our neighbors yelling, look up there! There were 10 what looked like balls of light at this distance moving around what I estimate to be a mile or so up. Higher than the planes are at that distance from the airport. They then formed into a hourglass shape or two triangles and remained that way for about 5 min. Then changed again to a inverted L shape and started to travel east twordes the lake.They then changed again to two rows of two or  five on top of five with the outside two being farther north than the others. They stayed this way until out of site about 15 min time total. Approx. 5 minutes later two more came directly north to south past us at a much closer distance ( still one on top of the other) so we could see the shape was a triangle or possibly diamond. We know of no one else who saw this on Sat. which we find incredible. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no internet contact information.  PD));42.0406515463917;-87.8855711340208
