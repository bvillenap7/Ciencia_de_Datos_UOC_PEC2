Sighting in Illinois;1978-10-15 02:30:00;30 sec;Sighting in Illinois I was riding in the back seat of a Navy buddies car coming from a party on the way back to Great Lakes Naval Training Center when I looked out across a large field on my left. I saw an orange disk shaped object sitting in the field approx. a half mile in distance from the highway. The whole object was glowing orange. The visual cross section of the disk was quite narrow with an antenna like structure sticking up from the middle which was also glowing orange. I never mentioned this to anyone at the time.
