Redish/orange sphere seen over Des Plaines, IL.;2014-07-13 21:32:00;20-22 seconds;Redish/orange sphere seen over Des Plaines Il. On July 13th, 2014, I took my dog outside for him to do his business, while waiting for him I was looking at the big dipper and saw a red object appeared from the west sky.  It was moving at a steady pace heading in an easterly direction.  It got larger as it passed much like the space station would (witch I’ve seen many time’s) and vanished as the space station would.  The object was an orange red color with yellow around the outside of it.  After the object passed a second object the same as the first appeared from the west a little further north of the first and traveling in the same manor.  Both object’s made no noise of any kind, I could hear the sound of an airplane traveling northbound due west leaving O’Hare airport, but that was the only sound I could hear.  Both object ’s took about 10 to 12 second’s each from the time I seen them to pass over head.  I’ve lived in my house since 1987 just north of O’Hare airport and know the difference between an airplane,  Helicopters, and the space station going over our home.   I have never seen anything like this in my 58 years on this earth.;42.0406515463917;-87.8855711340208
5 fireballs in the sky over Des Plaines/Glenview, Illinois.;2016-03-21 21:30:00;4 minutes;5 fireballs in the sky over Des Plaines/Glenview, Illinois. I went outside around 9:30pm to put some tools back in the garage and looked up towards the east to admire the full moon.  I then noticed 2 fireballs in the sky that were yellow in color and glowing brightly.  No flashing lights were observed and they were silent.   They appeared to be as high as an airplane would be, and were moving towards O'Hare Airport but then changed direction.  One went straight up into the sky and disappeared and the other went off to the west and disappeared.  I again turned to the east to look at the moon when I saw 3 more fireballs just like the first two.   I ran inside to get my son and wife and when I returned outside, two of the objects were still observable.  They continued west towards my house then turned north.  One disappeared and the light faded while the other continued north then turned to the southwest, where we watched it turn into a circle with no light that seemed to drop in altitude in the western sky until we could no longer see it.  Definitely not airplanes or helicopters. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous provides little contact information.  PD));42.0406515463917;-87.8855711340208
Fireball in sky near O'Hare Airport.;2017-05-14 22:20:00;3 minutes;Fireball in sky near O'Hare Airport I was out in my backyard when I saw a bright red-orange fireball shaped object through my tree. It was traveling east to west very high in the sky.  Thought it was a plane at first but no other lights and as stated, was very high in the sky.  As it traveled it turned shades of red to orange and pulsed.  Eventually totally vanished from sight like a light turned off.  Near O'Hare airport.;42.0406515463917;-87.8855711340208
