Lights over Geneseo.;2011-01-30 18:30:00;5 minutes;Lights over Geneseo I received a call from the neighbor that there were five lights in the sky heading west.  I walked outside to see my neighbor and her father outside looking at the lights.  I witnessed three of the lights in a triangle formation then two, then they faded out.  The lights were not blinking and were orange in color.   I call our local airport (MLI) and they had not seen or heard of any incident.;41.4668999999999;-90.1745000000001
