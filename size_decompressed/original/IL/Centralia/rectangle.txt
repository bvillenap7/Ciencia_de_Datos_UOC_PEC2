As I watched my friends looked at me looking at the sky then looked up and saw it too.  There wasno sound and it also looked transparent - it was the size of a large two story building - it lasted about 5 mins or more and we were all three speachless.  It will be in our minds forever. we wonder if we were the only ones out to see it that cold Jan. night. it traveled slow across the city then vanished.

At 9:30 in the evening on Jan. 25th, 2006 in Centralia IL 62801 - I did not hear any news on the radio or tv and I was alone - the object was very low. It was very cold in the low 30s or high 20s so maybe I was the only one to see it but for the first time in my 60 years I did indeed see a UFO. Just before I noticed it coming from the southeast every dog in the neighborhood was howling and when it fadded out they stopped. Is there any way that I could find out if anyone else saw this?;38.5273;-89.1355999999999
