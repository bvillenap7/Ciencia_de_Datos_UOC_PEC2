I was driving home from work between biggies and Centralia, IL, when I noticed a large flying object (not a plane) fly extremely fast.  It was oval shaped and had a bright white light at the top of the craft.  No other lights present.  It looked like it was getting ready to land in the woods.  I kept trying to tell myself that it was something else, but the light was so bright that you could see the shape of the craft.;38.5273;-89.1355999999999
