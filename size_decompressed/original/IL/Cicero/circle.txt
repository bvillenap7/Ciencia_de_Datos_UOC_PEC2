Bright White orb ufo casually passing by my backyard then disappearing into the sky.  ((anonymous report));2019-05-30 21:48:00;1:40;Bright White orb ufo casually passing by my backyard then disappearing into the sky At approximately 9:48pm on May 30, 2019, as i was getting home from picking up my girlfriend We observed a bright white orb UFO casually moving oddly in the sky above my house slightly to the northeast not very far i say maybe 250-600 yards away from where we were standing in my backyard.  I strangely noticed my camera from my phone was getting slightly out of focus every time i was  trying to stay still and record like as if the ufo was making some kind of electronic scrambling ufo signals towards my phone.  It moved from north to east real fast making absolutely no noise and no blinking, just super bright white orb object weaving and zoning making weird fast movements a commercial aircraft couldnâ€™t do and at the very end it disappeared turning slightly off and on then completely turning off.  Me and my girlfriend were discombobulated after it disappeared.  It also affected us emotionally like it sent out some kind of stealth ufo signals towards us making us feel out of place for 2-3 hours.
