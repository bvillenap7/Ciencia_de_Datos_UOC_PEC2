Ufo passes from northwest to southeast casually at low altitudes in cicero, ill.;2012-11-14 18:36:00;44 seconds;ufo passes from northwest to southeast casually at low altitudes in cicero, ill I went out for a smoke then i looked at the sky and saw something unusual so i went back inside quickly and grabbed my camcorder to record this object.  I saw a solid white/orb flying pass at low altitudes coming from northwest to southeast very casually then disappeared.  This ufo was passing the skies like if it was in a hurry but moving casually and smooth.  I knew it wasnt a plane or balloon because it was just a white solid glowing object moving pretty quickly without making any type of noise.  I was amazed to see something like this again because this wasn't the first time i see this object passing by. Here are a couple links to my sighting. the raw footage is:  http://youtu.be/JIHgMiYQRJc    Analyzed pics are:  https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.4974201795555.2186283.1314614467&type=1&l=bfafbcc4ea;41.8395;-87.7555000000001
