Red colored balloon-shaped object with some source of light from it.;2014-07-04 21:00:00;2 hours;red colored balloon-shaped object with some source of light from it It was approximately 21:00 Hours when me and 4 others were outdoors watching fireworks, when we spotted this balloon-shaped object.  I had a pair of 10x50 binoculars at the time, so I decided to take a look.   When I was looking through, I saw that the object looked like a red colored balloon with a lit candle inside or around it, not fireworks, an airplane, or even a star.  I saw the object facing the northwest part of the sky, and at the time, that part of the sky was still too bright to see any stars.   It wasn't an airplane either because I only saw ONE source of light coming from it, not a few which you would expect on any plane.   It absolutely wasn't fireworks because we saw the SAME object orbiting the sky horizontally a couple times in a span of a about two hours, compared to a firework which would go up into the sky and produce a LOT of light and last less than 10-15 seconds.   At that point I figured that since it wasn't an airplane, a star, or a firework, i! t had to be some type of UFO.;41.8395;-87.7555000000001
