These U.F.O's did pass the full moon at lightning fast speeds.  I had barely spotted the U.F.O's through my corner of my eye while recording through my camcorder.  I was stunned and wasn't sure what i saw or if my eyes were playing tricks on me.   After observations through my recording, i noticed the first U.F.O as a saucer like disc and it flew pass so quick that it went on a strait slant line kinda like wobbling and bouncing a tad bit and up and down at the same time.  The second U.F.O entered passed the moon as if it went down a strait line like if it bounced from the top of the moon and flew passed down the moon at lightning fast speeds.   The second U.F.O had a weird shape to it like if it had a top and pointy bottom. ((NUFORC Note:  Nighthawks and bats, caught in flight with video camera.  PD));41.8395;-87.7555000000001
