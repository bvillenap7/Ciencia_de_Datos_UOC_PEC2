Football-shaped-lit object moving in the sky;2009-06-30 21:00:00;3-5 minutes;Football-shaped-lit object moving in the sky Ok,I went to look out the window for a minute,and then I saw it. It was shaped like a football,with light blue lights all over it, and one big light at the end. It was about 9-930 at night, and very cloudy and warm. It was moving kinda slow through the clouds..then it hovered for a moment. I could not believe what I was seeing..After a minute more,it kept going across the sky toward the nursing home. That's when I called my son to hurry, and he came running,and caught a glimpse of it. While it was still moving across the sky, my son and I ran outside to find it, but, strangely enough, it disappeared!  That's about it. Weird,huh?;41.8395;-87.7555000000001
