A loud black triangle with red lights seen in Cicero, Illinois;2010-02-07 21:15:00;15 SECONDS;A loud black triangle with red lights seen in Cicero, Illinois My kids and I were playing video games when the house started shaking and the windows rattling like if a helicopter was on top of the house.  One of my daughthers looked out the front window and seen a triangle shaped UFO with bright different color lights on the bottom but mostly red.  She screamed that it was a UFO, so my oldest daughter ran to the back of the house to look out and seen it really low too and said it was a black triangle with red lights.  I didn't get to see it because by the time I went back there it was gone.  But I did feel the house shaking and my windows rattling as if a airplane was going to fall.  Nothing was heard after that.   Oh I would also like to add that I tried calling my friend with my cellphone and the call wouldn't go through, it wouldn't ring.  Also all my local channels went out.;41.8395;-87.7555000000001
Orange orbs spotted in a triangle formation outside Chicago.;2015-09-11 22:54:00;1 minute;orange orbs spotted in a triangle formation outside Chicago. Witness 1 Three orange orbs were spotted in a triangular formation by three witnesses at 1054 pm in Cicero, Illinois. The orbs moved north across the sky at high speeds and seemed to turn, in unison to head east then slowly faded into the distance. They were similar to the altitude of commercial aircraft.  Witness 2 Reports a triangle shaped air craft flying north overhead. I can describe the flying formation as similar to birds flying together in a triangle. They also looked similar to birds. I believe the object was either reflecting light or emiting it. Three dim lit UFO(s) flew together one leading the two space crafts behind along the two sides. I recall the three objects rotating in a unison pattern. They did move together to change direction in the sky from north to east slightly in the sky.  10:45 PM CST;41.8395;-87.7555000000001
