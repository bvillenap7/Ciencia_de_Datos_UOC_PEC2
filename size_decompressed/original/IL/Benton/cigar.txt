Cigar shaped with two round objects in center.;2003-08-10 19:30:00;2 min.;Cigar shaped with two round objects in center. It was still daylight, but late evening. We saw a white light traveling across the sky from north to south. It wasn't too high up or traveling very fast.  There was no sound from the object. It was very long and cigar shaped, but it kind of looked like round objects in the middle. Never saw anything like it.;37.9977;-88.9342
