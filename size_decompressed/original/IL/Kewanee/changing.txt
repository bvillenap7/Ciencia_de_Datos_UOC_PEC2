Shape changing lights in southern sky.;2017-05-29 05:15:00;5-10 seconds;Shape changing lights in Southern sky I had just stepped out side and I saw something in the southern sky.  I saw a blue to a teal green light with a smaller white light to the east of the blue one.  Both lights looked to be part of the same object.  I first thought I was looking at an airplane turning to the north.  All the sudden the blue teal light gets very large and bright at the same time.  That lasted no more then 2 seconds, then the white light grew in size and got brighter as the blue teal one shrunk in size.  But did not grow to the size of the blue teal light.  The lights looked to have had a grey haze around them.  The white light shrunk to a dull red to amber color and disappeared.;41.2406;-89.9324999999999
