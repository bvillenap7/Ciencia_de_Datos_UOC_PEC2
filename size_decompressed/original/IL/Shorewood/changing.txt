Huge white blimp covered with clouds.;2007-06-22 17:00:00;30 Seconds;Huge white blimp covered with clouds. I was driving to my mom's home in Shorewood, Il., with my 6-year-old grandson.  I was driving southbound on Route 59 turning right onto a service road that runs into Seil Road where I eventually stopped so we could get a better look.  I looked at the time and it was 4:58 p.m.  What caught my eye was a bright reflection in the sky over the southbound I-55 traffic.  It was a completely cloudy day and the clouds were not moving.  What sun there was peeking through the clouds had obviously reflected off of this UFO. I thought it was a huge blimp at first however, it was completely covered with white coulds and as it travelled slowly west it changed its shape, expanded and disappeared into the surrounding clouds.  I did not hear any sounds from this craft.  If the bright reflection had not caught my eye and my grandson had not witnessed this as well, I would have talked myself out of seeing this.  But I truly did.;41.5039;-88.2152000000001
