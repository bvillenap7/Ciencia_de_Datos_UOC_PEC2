We were coming from a nearby Halloween campfire and started to drive through a neighboorhood, looked up and seen a huge floating disk. It was pitch black out so I couldn't make out the shape too well. However, it had a blue light on the bottom and 2 (or more) red lights around the side making it appear to be a disk. 4 witnesses. The strangest thing about this was that it made absolutely no noise. It was approximatley 150 feet from the tops of houses and added to the fear because I thought it was going to crash onto one of the roofs. We stopped the car and it hovered over the houses for about  10 seconds and then jetted off unbelievably fast....so fast that it was out of sight in seconds. We attempted to follow it to a cornfield but when we looked up, all we could see where two lights and it appeared to have split in half. Amazed that no one else has came forward with this sighting.;41.5039;-88.2152000000001
