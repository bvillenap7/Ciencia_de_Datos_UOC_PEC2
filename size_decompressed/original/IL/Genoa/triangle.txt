At approximately 8:20 to 8:24pm CST on April 11, 2012 I saw an object in the sky while driving west bound on IL Rt-72 located somehere between Hampshire, IL and Genoa, IL. Movement and Size: It crossed the midline of my filed of view which was IL Rt.-72 facing west.  The object appeared to be moving very rapidly and without any apparent noise traveling  fully south.to the north over a period of not more than about 2-3 seconds. The altitude of the object is difficult to say.  The visual perspective is that of what a passenger jet would be near the time of landing but it moved in a fairly straight line and not falling.  Its size compares to the approximate size of pea held at about arms length (3ft) much larger than the diameter of a star yet much smaller than the apparent diameter of the moon. Shape and Color:  Its shape was somewhat triangular. The triangular portion had a shiny, white metallic luster leading in the northerly direction. The end of the object had a glowing irridescent appearance.  It looked similar to a nearly molten triangular piece of metal.;42.102;-88.6865
