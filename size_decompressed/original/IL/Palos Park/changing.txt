Southeast sky, about 40 degrees above horizon, but very far away. Looks like a small cluster of 2 - 4 stars that change color and position but stay very close to each other. At first we thought it was a plane very high up, but it was not moving relative to landmarks. Could it be a star cluster, galaxy or a UFO?;41.663;-87.8524
