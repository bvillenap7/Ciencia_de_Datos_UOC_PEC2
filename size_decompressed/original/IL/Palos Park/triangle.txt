At about 23:00 my son and I were taking some things out of my garage it was partly cloudy that night, we both noticed a very bright shining object in the sky, which had a tint of purple and red flashing faintly on one side, we continued to watch and about 10 minutes later two more lights appeared forming a triangle, the object continued to slowly moveing from East to southwest, we looked out about 30 minutes later and it had moved again, by around 1:30 the triangle totally disappeared.
