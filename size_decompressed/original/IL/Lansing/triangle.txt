Meteor objects leading toward formation of triangle lights.;2008-07-11 20:50:00;2 Min;Meteor objects leading toward formation of triangle lights. While driving to a local softball game near 9 PM CDT my friend and I saw what looked like a large and small meteor streaking across the sky, very high in the sky.  As we continued to drive and follow the object we noticed an array of triangle shaped lights off in the distance...almost to where the meteor like object was heading.  As the meteor objects faded into the distance, toward the horizon, the triangle formation of lights scattered very quickly in random like directions.  As I turned onto a street heading toward the direction of the lights in the sky they were gone and the whole thing was over.  We later, after the softball game, were listening to a local Chicago radio station, 96.3 FM, and heard people call into the station and tell the DJ (on air) that they had seen the lights or UFO's as well.  This occurred between 8:45-9PM on Friday July 11th, 2008 near the town of Lansing, IL.;41.5679;-87.538
