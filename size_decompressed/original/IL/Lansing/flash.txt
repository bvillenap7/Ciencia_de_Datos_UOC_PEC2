Object hovered, descended, rose and flew In circle. My husband and I were watching the westward sky for fireworks.  I noticed what I thought was a red twinkling star.  The object then began to move in a slow northerly direction.  My husband believed it was a plane. The object then stopped and hovered in place for about 10 seconds and immediately accelerated and traveled in the opposite direction.  We watched while the object began to travel downward quickly.  It then began to climb back upward and traveled in a large circle. It went back and forth, east to west, and north to south for the next few minutes. It dropped and rose again and then continued westward until it was out of sight. It kept blinking bright red the entire time.;41.5679;-87.538
