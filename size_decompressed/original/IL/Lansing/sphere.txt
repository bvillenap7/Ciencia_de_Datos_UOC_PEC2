On Saturday, August 25, 2012 at about 2050 hours I saw a large ball of flames travel from south to north over my home in Lansing, a south suburb of Chicago.  I was standing in my driveway talking to my neighbor’s son when I observed the orange ball coming from the south.  All I could see at first was the orange ball, which appeared to be in flames.  The height and speed appeared to be the same as a plane heading to either Midway or O’Hare airports.  There was absolutely no engine sounds at all, which would be audible if it were a plane going over head at that height.  I had my binoculars because I had just watched the ISS go over my home from west to east about ten minutes prior to spotting the fireball.  I watched the ball continue north and suddenly the fire seemed to go out and I saw a dark figure in the sky where the flames went out.  I could see this flameless dark figure for about 15-20 seconds and then I could no longer see it.  My neighbor’s son took! a photo of the object with his telephone.  I would estimate that the object was visible for 3-4 minutes total.I am a 61 year old retired police officer & my neighbor’s son is around 40 and works for a park district near Denver, CO.;41.5679;-87.538
