I'm a person with slow learning handicap developemental disability, recieves services from a insitutional lived in facility called: Little City Foundation, in Palatine IL. It is a home for people who are mentally handicap with other callanges disabilities. I was living at Little City, back in the summer of 1977 in the month of June. I was living on Cedar Cottage at the time, while my stay on the campus at Little City. Myself and five others of us program participants from Little City, were hanging around in front of our home on Cedar Cottage. It was around 7:00pm. when had notice a strange oval object, hoovering over to the West while hang over in front of the home of Cedar cottage. The oval shaped object had a white body shape with a glass dome on top, and it had two red lights in the back like tail lights. And it had two orange lights in front with a green light on top of the glass dome. It made a high pitch eerie sound, with a spooky noise. The oval shaped object had stood there for about 15min. then it started to headed out towards the West, and 15 minutes later, the object had headed towards back to to our cottage flying very low! Low enough where we can see it more up close. It made another sound that went Bloop Bloop Bloop Bloop Bloop. I had notice that this oval shaped object was heading Northeast maybe it was heading towards over by the Glenview Air Naval Airbase. (in which it is has been closed down known as of today) As of now. I graduated out of Little City, no longer live there. I am 43 years old and I lived out in the community on my own in the city of Chicago. As of now up until to this date, Nobody really claims that they had seen this strange looking oval shaped object! or even remember it! If anybody knows of this or recall of seeing this Oval Shaped Object in June of 1977. I would like to know what in the heck it was??? ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
