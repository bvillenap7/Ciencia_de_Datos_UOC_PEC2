At about 2:17pm on Saturday. May 19,2001 Two people saw a cigar shaped metalic object extremely high above the scattered clouds.  It was first sited by my friend and we didn't know what it was.  It flew directly over us until it was out of our sight.  It gleamed in the sun and was moving at a very high speed.  The shape was more of a elongated oval.  From our perspective it looked somewhat like a missile or something that we could not identify.  We watched this object for approximately two or three minutes.;42.1249301886792;-88.0360849056603
