Booms associated with Bartlet sightings 10/29/03.;2003-10-29 20:00:00;2 seconds;Booms associated with Bartlet sightings 10/29/03. This is in respons to the Report from Bartlet Il on 10/29/03.  My mother and I (both grown adults)were at home watching T.V. and heard a loud boom at approx 8:00 pm Central time. I thought maybe it was a sonic boom. We have heard them before in the area such as on 9/11 when jets responded to the attacks, and also after 9/11 when jets were called to escort a commercial airliner back to O'Hare due to a threat. About five to seven minutes after the first boom was yet another one. Shook the windows and other things, then about three minutes later another one that was not as intense, and sounded like it was further away. It was a clear night without any thunderstorms. This could be related to the sighting in Bartlet as that town is only about 10 miles from Palatine.;42.1249301886792;-88.0360849056603
Solid red lights over O'hare airport.;2007-02-08 19:50:00;3 minutes;Solid red lights over O'hare airport. I walked outside and noticed a plane to the southeast at approx. 10,000 feet over O'hare airport traveling north.  I then noticed that the two red lights ( on the wings? ) were not blinking.  This attracted my attention, so I kept watching.  As it got east of me and passed, the two red ligts (on the front?) became two white lights with a red light in the middle.  Still no blinking or strobing.  As it traveled north, it had more the look of a satelite in speed and altitude.
