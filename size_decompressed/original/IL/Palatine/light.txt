Bright anomolus light seen streaking over Chicagoland;2009-08-20 23:30:00;1-2 seconds;Bright anomolus light seen streaking over Chicagoland I was driving home from work on the night of August 20th, heading southbound on IL-53 just South of Long Grove Road. It was approximately 11:30 pm., the sky was partially cloudy and the weather was fair at the time. For a brief couple of seconds, I witnessed a bright orange ball of light in the southern sky, that seemed to be traveling in a north-easterly direction. The light had no trail behind it, of smoke or sparks. It seemed to travel in an arc towards Chicago, and I lost it behind the clouds over the city. The ball of light was as bright as Venus or Mars at their brightest in the night sky, and traveled about 40 degrees of the sky faster than any airplane could silently, and at an altitude above the cloud cover. The object was clearly visible despite the city's light pollution of the night sky. Although I have seen shooting stars and meteorites, I never see any of these phenomenon in urban Chicagoland.

Orange and Red light;2011-10-01 20:30:00;90 sec;Orange and Red light As I walked to tend a fire, I looked up and to the East noticing how bright, big and clear Jupiter appeared.  I played in the fire for about a minute and looked up to peek at Jupiter again. I looked up to see an orange light moving at me from the East, approx. 10 -20 times the size of Jupiter, or a small pea at arms length.  It then shifted color to a pretty red, back to orange, then back to red.  I say “shifted” it did not blink, just changed color in a relaxed manor, about every second.  Pretty cool. I was very excited at this point, I finally was witnessing some orange lights.  They seem to be quite prevalent in many reports, lately. The light kind of meandered slightly, did not seem as if it had a constant speed (about that of a single engine plane), or a consistent direction.  It was difficult to really focus on, a few times I found myself playing with my vision through my bi-focals, because it seemed like I should be able to focus a little better on it.  This light had no sound attributed to it, and appeared to be about as far from me as a single engine aircraft. I would put it’s altitude at about 2500 feet. The light slowly meandered to a more southerly direction. Now looking SE at the light, the pulsing color began to have some white for a couple of pulses, then back to O and R.  It then began to dim quickly, to about the size of a star, then just faded away, heading South. I had made a report in February of ’07, witnessed a number of interesting occurrences until August ‘07 that I just didn’t report many other reports and in my mind there is something to all of this, I’m already convinced, but this was so interesting and seems to be very prominent now, I figured I would add this report. Eyes to the sky, folks.  Never any sound, if you are not looking, you’d never know.  If I would have played in the fire for another 30 seconds, I would have missed this.  Thanks. Note: I live 20 or so miles NW of O’hare airport.  I have craft over my house constantly, and numerous pilot friends, always looking up when I can.  This was nothing of the ordinairy.;42.1249301886792;-88.0360849056603
2 Red flashing lights;2012-05-19 23:00:00;5 minutes;2 Red flashing lights Somewhere around 11pm or midnight, my friend and I stepped out of his house for a smoke. I noticed a flashing red light in the sky and figured it was a plane, since there are always planes from O’Hare in the area.  When I looked closer I saw that it had no other lights, it was simply a flashing red light which I don’t remember ever seeing on any plane before. Then I told my friend to look and he saw it too, it was quite obvious.  We watched as it flew in a wide arc towards us.  As I said I see plenty of planes all the time.  It seemed to be at a pretty high altitude, not at a really high cruising altitude but definitely not low like a landing plane would be. It seemed to be moving pretty fast too. Once it was facing us, we could make out that there were 2 blinking red lights side by side, clearly one singular object.  Eventually it went directly overhead and we could see that there were 2 much dimmer lights in roughly the same places as the red ones.  These lights were blue or green, one was slightly brighter than the other.  From far away you couldn’t see these lights at all. I couldn’t make out any kind of shape of the craft. When it was travelling overheard we started to hear a jet engine, but it was pretty quiet and seemed to be emanating from far behind the aircraft, I assume because it was travelling at a high speed. It went on traveling west to east, in the direction of Lake Michigan until it was out of sight.  My friend and I waited outside for 5 or 10 minutes when I noticed the same flashing red lights again, at the same altitude, but this time they were traveling in the opposite direction.  It seemed to make the same wide arc as before but in reverse, eventually flying out of sight to the south or southeast. Currently there is the nato meeting going on downtown and the last few days I’ve heard plenty of military helicopters around this area and these lights just make it much weirder.  I can’t say for sure that these lights are related but it doesn’t seem like a coincidence, especially considering that whatever I saw was apparently staying over the area.  I did find it weird that the aircraft would turn around like that instead of simply circling around though.;42.1249301886792;-88.0360849056603
2-3 blue/red orbs flying north, then it began ascending/descending, quick right/left turns, and vertical turns.;2014-06-27 03:30:00;3-5 minutes;2-3 blue/red orbs flying north, then it began ascending/descending, quick right/left turns, and vertical turns. It was around 3:30am that I looked out my balcony and as I looked up at the tree, enjoying the breeze, a red/blue orb streaked across the sky. My balcony faces north and the object flew right above my house heading north.  As it past my house it made a weird noise too. I can best describe it as the sound when you steam something.  That tsssh sound. It was a bit foggy too. So was it going fast enough to cause that noise due to the foggy mist?  Being that I'm on the second floor ( balcony ) I could still see the object. It flew and then stopped in midair about 3-4 blocks north from my house.  It stopped and then descended to where I could not see it anymore because of trees.  I waited of course to see if it'd go back up, and what do you know, it did.  It quickly flew up and started moving left, then right, and vertically up.   Clearly NOT some airplane.  It looked like it would appear, and then disappear, and appear again to be on the other side of where it! was. There was one major blue/red light that really stood out, but then I saw another light right next to it. Then I could Bailey make out what looked to be one more orb/light trailing with the other two. At one moment I even thought they were a single object. Like one of those triangle UFO's, but then again my mind might just have wanted to make a picture out of the orbs. This lasted about 2-3mins of my clearly seeing it, and then 2 or so more mins where I could sort off still see it appearing and then disappearing. Oh quick thing too. When I saw it ascending and descending I tried communicating by flashing my lights on and off. Didn't seem to do anything. Either way this was pretty cool. I was able to record it descending once with my iPhone. So I have proof. Also one more thing at the end I could have sworn I saw it shoot out acouple beams out ( reddish beams ). And even if the trees weren't blocking my view, I could swear it looked like it at one point might it also mi! ght have landed. I was so close to running outside down the 3-! 4 blocks down to see if I could get a better look. I didn't though because I didn't want to miss anything in case it flew back up again, which it did.

Red/orange lights or flames in the late evening sky--moving northwest.;2015-05-23 23:50:00;15+ minutes;Red/orange lights or flames in the late evening sky--moving northwest Honestly, they were probably just lanterns flying in the sky, but I can't find reference to them anywhere, and oddly enough they either went out or disappeared over my street.   At that time of night they would have probably been floating for a fair amount of time if they were coming from a carnival or firework display of some sort. Just would love to confirm this since they were rather interesting and beautiful floating much lower than a plane or helicopter-they were in a crooked line, and perhaps as high as one might see a large balloon or high flying kite. No photos my phone was dead.;42.1249301886792;-88.0360849056603
Unknown erratic movement in a :30 second shutter photo.;2021-03-09 21:04:00;:30 seconds;Unknown erratic movement in a :30 second shutter photo. I often go outside to shoot pictures of the stars, planets and Moon.  On March 9 it was very clear outside, so I went out to shoot some time-lapse images of the stars.  From 21:04 to 22:10 I shot about 33 photos, most at a :30 second shutter.  Upon review of the first photo of the night, and only the first photo, there is erratic movement in the sky during the :30 second shot.  This shot is pointing South by Southwest, and the unidentified object draws a bouncing line from point to point.  Maybe this is a common camera abnormality, but I am not familiar with it.  While the camera is stationary, and shows all the stars and trees in the background to be stationary, this object moved around the shot in the :30 second shutter time.  Of the other 30+ shots I took that night, I don’t see anything else like this, including the shots in the same direction that I took shortly after the first.  I hope you can tell me what this is? I can provide other images from that ! night, if you think it could help.;42.1249301886792;-88.0360849056603
Three lit objects below the cloud line.;2021-04-11 10:00:00;10 minutes;Three lit objects below the cloud line. Three sporadically moving zig zagging lit objects just below the overcast dark clouds. Witnessed them mid morning for about 5 minutes in the Westerly skies. After approximately 5 minutes the three flying objects went straight up through the clouds and disappeared. I have no idea what this could have been.;42.1249301886792;-88.0360849056603
