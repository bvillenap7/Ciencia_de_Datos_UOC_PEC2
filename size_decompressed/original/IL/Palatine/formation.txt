I observed a formated shape in the sky that I knew was not from any country. I am homeless.{ No drugs or alochol} Friday night I was sitting on my car leaning back looking up at the sky, in a parking lot off of Palatine Road, in Palatine, Illinois. The sky had some clouds, mostly it was mostly clear.  At 10:40 pm this shape started to move across the sky going North. You could see it was somekind of craft. No blinking lights just a round shape, with a light effect to determine that it was not an identified type of craft, reconized from any country.  It was very independent and moved very smoothly, with power to move faster, then it seemed to stop by a cloud.  First it moved going straight, and then it seemed to movein a swerving motion, then turning in a left direction, and went West.  It appeared again at 11:17pm and moved the same way going in a right direction and heading East, slowing down and then speeding up finally disappearing.  I waited around until about 12:00pm and the craft never reappeared again.  It had a movement about it that seemed to be highly technical advanced just by seeing it travel thru the sky.  I never ever have seen anything like that before.;42.1249301886792;-88.0360849056603
I truely beleive I witnessed a UFO craft, from another world.;2005-06-24 19:40:00;parking lot;I truely beleive I witnessed a UFO craft, from another world. I was homeless. {No drugs or alcholo}. Friday night, I was sitting on my car, leaning back looking up at the sky, in a parking lot off of Palatine Road, in Palatine, Illinois. The sky had some cumulus clouds above. At 7:40 pm this shape started to move across the sky, moving slow heading North. You could tell it was somekind of egg sharped craft, not from this earth. No blinking lights just an dull grayish colored egg shape. Suddenly, it had a blinking flash light effect as the craft parked next to one of the cumulus clouds, as if it was taking pictures below. Suddenly it powered faster going straight across the sky, then it seemed to move in a zigzagged motion, then turning in a left direction, heading west. It appeared again at 9:17 pm, moving again heading the opposite direction, zigzagging going right, and heading east, slowing down and then speeding up ward moving faster, and finally disappearing. I waited around 11:00pm, the craft never re-appeared again. It had a Aura, and motion that made it seem, that it was a highly advanced technical craft, to advanced to be designed from any military sights of our earth.;42.1249301886792;-88.0360849056603
3 orbs of brilliant, pulsing white light & indistinct shape seen in a diagonal formation on the horizon in the SE sky.;2016-04-03 22:20:00;10 minutes;3 orbs of brilliant, pulsing white light & indistinct shape seen in a diagonal formation on the horizon in the SE sky Sunday, 04/03/2016, approximately 10:20PM:  I opened the back door to let my dog out, and was greeted by an incredible sight.  Three bright lights in a diagonal formation on the horizon in the southeast sky toward O'Hare...hovering for at least 10 minutes and pulsing brilliant white, the middle one brighter than the other two.   No unusual sounds.  Planes from O'Hare passing both above and below the objects, and the lights from the planes much smaller (1/8th the size) of the white orbs.   My wife got a digital camera shot of all 3 by zooming in you can see them clearly between the power lines with the water tower light for contrast.  We also have video of all 3 lights with planes in the sky as well.   At approximately 10:30PM, all three lights floated (best word possible) to the southwest and disappeared the middle light, which was the largest and brightest, was the last to go.  With all due respect to healthy skepticism, I am both elated & mystified.   Both my wife and I are police officers.;42.1249301886792;-88.0360849056603
