round black object hovering over line of trees;2000-09-25 17:00:00;2-5 min;round black object hovering over line of trees Sitting in slow-moving traffic going north on Algonquin Rd. I looked towards the sky and off in the distance, above a line of trees, I can't guess how high, saw a round dark circle, not moving for at least a minute, then I lost sight of it for a moment going past a sign along the road, and when I saw it again, it had gained in altitude by several hundred feet at least, and not moving again, then about a minute later, just wasn't there.;42.1249301886792;-88.0360849056603
Strange star like objects spotted moving in the sky on a sunny afternoon;2007-09-09 15:00:00;5 minutes;Strange star like objects spotted moving in the sky on a sunny afternoon I was lying on the couch in my living room watching TV. Directly above the couch on the ceiling is a skylight. I happened to gaze up through the skylight at the blue sky and noticed what I initially thought was a very bright star. But, as I watched it it moved slowly from left to right. It also changed in light intensity. When I initially spotted it it was very noticeable it would fade and re-brighten. After a few moments I decided to get my brother to come look at it too (to make sure what I was seeing was real). Once he came downstairs and I pointed it out to him he also thought it was very strange. He confirmed that it was indeed moving back and forth. At this time he also noticed some fainter star like objects close to the main object which also appeared to move slowly. As we watched them some of the objects would disappear and then reappear a few seconds later.  I have seen satellites on clear nights moving across the night sky, and know that these were definitely not satellites. As far as I know satellites move along a linear trajectory these definitely were free moving. The fact that they could disappear and reappear in a different spot was mysterious. I have no idea what these objects were but they were definitely not like anything I have ever seen. To give you some background, I am located about 20 miles from O'Hare International airport, so I see alot of aircraft in the sky here. This was absolutely not a high altitude, man-made plane of any type.;42.1249301886792;-88.0360849056603
Bright red object moving slowly in the sky, changes color and direction and disappears.;2012-11-30 20:20:00;60-90 seconds;Bright red object moving slowly in the sky, changes color and direction and disappears Sighting date and time- November 30th, 2012 at approximately 8:20pm Location – Palatine, IL  - 46 degrees North East in the sky Weather – Partly Cloudy –  The part of the sky I say the UFO was clear  On November 30th, 2012 I let my dog out and looked up at the sky and saw a bright red circular object. It was partly cloudy but this part of the sky was completely clear.   At first I thought it may be Mars because of how much red was in the object but then I noticed it was moving very slowly to the west.  Because of the color and slow movement it caught my attention. Next I thought it may be an airplane far off in the distance but I dismissed that quickly.  I did not think it was an airplane because it did not have any flashing warning lights on it and it was more of a solid red object with maybe a lighter whitish outline.  Also, the object seemed to be moving very slow in the sky. I could not take my eye off of it because I could tell it was something I have never seen before.  I saw this object moving very slowly in the sky and it seemed to be far off in the sky (I thought it was a star or planet at first).  I saw this object moving in a straight line for about 60-90 seconds.   Then the object seemed to lose the red color and began to look more white/clear and looked to change direction and travel towards the north.  Once the object started to lose the red color and change direction the object completely disappeared into the sky within 2-3 seconds.  Once the object changed color and disappeared into the sky so quickly, I knew I saw something special/amazing/ unexplainable.  I stayed outside for another 5 minutes looking in the same direction in the sky to see if it reappeared & it never did.  I took out my smart phone with the compass app and it was at about 46 degrees North in the sky.;42.1249301886792;-88.0360849056603
