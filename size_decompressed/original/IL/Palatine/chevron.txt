We looked up and saw a chevron shaped object zip over our heads.  We faintly got a picture of the object with my camera phone (a RAZR to be exact).  But when we looked at it, it was all blotchy with white spots. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  Possible hoax.
