I was outside letting the dog out and saw a silent flickering red orb traveling at a high speed in the sky overhead.  I was confused by it having no green light as a plane would.   About 10 seconds later another came into view in line with the other one.  They flew from west to east and at regular intervals more kept coming until they stopped after 15 minutes. The strangest part is that they were at a constant speed following the exact same straight line path as each other.  I never believed in E.T.s but I am changing my mind as I have no explanation.

Red orb increasing light intensity and rapid movement away straight up;2012-09-03 20:15:00;3 minutes;red orb increasing light intensity and rapid movement away straight up I was driving south down Quentin road with my girlfriend, at the intersection of Quentin and Colfax I noticed a red round light above the traffic light.  The girlfriend said it was a plane and was red because of the traffic light the light turned green and we continued down the road and the light remained red and actually &quotincreased&quot in size, probably got closer, to the point where it looked like a radio tower light at the top.  there are no towers in that direction and it was almost directly above us as we were traveling down the road.  i turned off down a side street to stop and look at it and get a video, by the time we were stopped it appeared to have also stopped moving in the X-Y motion and began moving straight away up until the light faded to a pinpoint and then gone.;42.1249301886792;-88.0360849056603
