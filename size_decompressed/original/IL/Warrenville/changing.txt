RAPID MOVING< COLOR CHANGING OBJECT. NORTH TO SOUTH < STRAIGHT UP AND ACROSS;2005-09-26 23:30:00;3-4 minutes;RAPID MOVING< COLOR CHANGING OBJECT. NORTH TO SOUTH < STRAIGHT UP AND ACROSS Driving east bound on Butterfeild Rd. (route 56) towards route 59 in Warrenville. Just before I passed Fermi Lab, just before Eola Rd., I seen a bright white light (orb) in the eastern sky, which was going across the sky from north to the south at a fast rate of speed, crossing OVER the road that I was traveling on, in the distance. Then, it rapidly broke stright up into the sky, changing to a red color, and fading a SLIGHT bit in color intensity, and twinkled a bit. Then, it shot across to the north, ACROSS Butterfeild Road ( I was using the road as a point of referance to mark its traveling) at a huge rate of speed, and as it did, it turned white again. Once it was to the North of Butterfeild Road, it then just kind on bobbled and turned to a twinkling red. From there it was moving eratticly, kind of jumpy, up and down and to the north a bit more. This object didn't look much higher than the trees in the background, and has I had to turn off of Butterfeild Road, it was just above the tree tops towards the Warrenville/Wheaton city limits.  I lost sight of it once I had to turn. Someone else driving east on Butterfeild Road, HAD to see this as well.;41.8289;-88.1884
