strange flying craft in paralell formation that was followed by red craft at rapid speed.;2009-06-11 21:45:00;4 minutes;strange flying craft in paralell formation that was followed by red craft at rapid speed. Object flying in formation from East to West across the sky.  Object was very high up, to high to get a shot on film. Flew in perfect paralell formation.  Unable to see outline due to height in sky.  Then following it was a solid red craft at a rapid speed. Is there anyway to check radar over the area at this time with a 5-10 minute buffer?;41.8289;-88.1884
