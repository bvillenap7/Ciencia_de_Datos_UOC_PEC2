The objects were at an estimated altitude of 40,000 ft. arranged in somewhat circular pattern. When we first spotted them We assumed they were weather balloons, as the National Weather Service has an office at the Quad City International Airport. Is it usual practice to launch that many at one time? I watched them off and on for about an hour. Eventually I lost track of all but one. It suddenly started travelling West at a fast rate of speed. I tracked it until It was lost in the Sun.;41.4946;-90.5675000000001
