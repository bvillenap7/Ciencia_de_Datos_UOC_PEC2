This happened last year in the summer time.  I was sitting outside like usual and watching the sky. I saw a light just appear out of nowhere and it flew in a straight line for about 3-5 seconds when it got real bright and then faded away. This happened about 4 nights and I tried to get my mom to see it but she thought I was just mistaking it for an aaircraft, but in all the times I've sat out there, there has been no aircraft take the path that this took. I didnt bother to tell anybody except my mom because I dont think they would have believed me.  I also saw a couple nights later a bright craft fly in a straight line flying east. This lasted about 10 seconds before it got bright and faded away. There is something that happened also a few years ago in Milan, Illinois around midnight. I was at Camden Park with my boyscout group when some of the other kids ran in and said something exploded around the moon. I went out and looked up and there was what looked like debris floating around the moon. Then there went a bright light going pretty fast, I would have to say about 500 mph?, and it flew by and over the horizon. About 5 minutes later, it appeared again from the opposite horizon. Then when that had disappeared over the horizon again, another one appeared and flew after the first. There was no sound in either of the reports. That is all that happened that night.

You can still see him now they're still coming if you look up at the Moon.  ((Starlink satellites));2020-03-28 08:30:00;8-8:30pm;You can still see him now they're still coming if you look up at the Moon until the right it looks like Venus it's the brightest light in the sky the right underneath that these lights are manifesting one after another and they're flying to the right up into outer space and it's been going on for about an hour now.  They're flying slow now but they were going faster and zigzagging  I saw one stop and switch directions.;41.4946;-90.5675000000001
