((HOAX??))  Large black silent object with smaller black sphere trailing.  ((anonymous));2016-04-19 13:30:00;1 minute;Large black silent object with smaller black sphere trailing Large black object with smaller black sphere trailing at about 25 yards passed over my house.  At first thought it was a mother bird teaching a baby to fly.   As it got closer I noticed no flapping movement and it was moving way to fast and not making any noise.  It was shaped like the batman symbol for lack of anything to describe it to.   My wife and daughter also saw it.
