UFO or Enormous Spider?  500 Lights On Object0: Yes;1969-07-15 14:00:00;5 Minutes;UFO or Enormous Spider?  500 Lights On Object0: Yes Iâ€™m fairly certain the year was 1969 because I was about 3 years old when it happened.  I was outside riding my tricycle by myself on the large patio at my apartment complex.  All I remember is this huge, round, light tan colored thing.   It looked to me like a huge Daddy Long-Legged spider.  It covered the entire area of the patio - probably about 30-40 feet in diameter.  Scared and not knowing what to think of it I ran inside.   For years I thought this was just a weird dream, but I have always since (and still to this day) been terrified of Daddy Long-Legged spiders.  Having been so young and lacking sophisticated language I think I was unable to store this memory properly and so coded it as a huge spidery dream.
