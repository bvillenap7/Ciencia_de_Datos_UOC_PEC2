I looked up at the sky from my backyard and saw a rectangular silver panel (like the side of a Mac truck) with nothing else around it. It appeared to be at the height a hot air balloon or a blimp.  It was just gliding along above the tree line.  While I was observing, it made a sharp turn (90Â° turn), then dipped below my line of sight. It had to be at least the size of a large trailer home.  Literally looked like a semi truck's haul was floating by.  Gave me the creeps and didn't really sink in until an hour or so later that I had seen something that didn't make any sense!;40.1127886178862;-88.258524390244
