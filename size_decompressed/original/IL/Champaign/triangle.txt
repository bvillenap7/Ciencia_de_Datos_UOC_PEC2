lights tumble over champaign, illinois;2004-04-04 01:00:00;6 seconds;lights tumble over champaign, illinois Early this morning, my girlfriend and I went to go look at the stars at about 12:30.  At around 1:00, a group of lights came from the southwest and passed directly over us going into the northeast.  There were about eight lights arranged into a sort of triangular shape, although it may have been more of an X.  It was hard to tell exactly because the lights were spinning around.  Whatever it was was moving pretty fast because it only took about 6 seconds to cross the sky.  In this time, it made at least 3 rotations tumbling across the sky in a straight line.  I guess it's possible that it was more than one object and that all the lights were separate, but they were moving as if they were part of the same object. From our point of view, it was hard to tell how high it was, and so also we couldn't tell how big it was, but it was about 10 degrees across (the length of your fist at arms length)  After seeing this thing, we were both pretty jumpy and left.  After telling a friend what we had seen, they told us that another friend of ours saw something odd also.  Talking with them, it seems we saw the same thing.  they saw it from the side, from the 11th floor of their building, they had a better judgement of its height, and said it was really low in the sky.  If it was low, it was probably about 75-100 feet in length.  I'm not the type of person to believe that this was some sort of extraterrestrial ship or anything, I just want to post this to see if anybody else saw it also and if anyone has an explination.;40.1127886178862;-88.258524390244
fast moving triangle with neon green light at each end, making no sound as it moved;2009-04-05 22:08:00;7 seconds;fast moving triangle with neon green light at each end, making no sound as it moved The event took place a little after 10pm.  I was leaving a restaurant and walking to my car.  It was a clear night and there were a decent amount of stars out.  I paused to look at the stars for a moment when I saw three lights in the sky.  They were moving from a SE to NW direction.  Because they stayed the exact same distance from each other, I quickly assessed that they were part of the same object.  The lights themselves were a sort of neon greenish color and if you connected them, they would form a triangle.  I couldn’t tell you for sure what the color of the object was but it “felt” like it was black. I knew within seconds that what I was seeing was unlike anything I’d ever witnessed before.  I knew within seconds that I was seeing a UFO.  There is no doubt in my mind.  It moved across the sky at an incredibly fast speed, way faster than anything man-made.  It made no sound what-so-ever.  It simply…..glided, is the way I would describe it.  Because it was moving across the sky so fast, I probably only saw it for less than 10 seconds.  Since then I have researched this a bit, and have found many other reports from people of the same thing.  Big, black, fast moving triangles, and no, it was not a U.S. Stealth Bomber.  This was faster and made no sound.;40.1127886178862;-88.258524390244
