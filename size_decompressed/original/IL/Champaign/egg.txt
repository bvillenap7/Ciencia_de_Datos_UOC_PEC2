Black silhouette in twilight sky, almond shaped UFO moving N to S at constant speed and low altitude;1990-09-22 19:00:00;2 min;Black silhouette in twilight sky, almond shaped UFO moving N to S at constant speed and low altitude While walking out of K-mart I looked up at flock of birds in the twilight sky.  Above/beyond the birds I noticed an object slowly moving northward.  It immediately gave me chills because it didn't look like any flying vehicle I'd ever seen (and since I grew up in Wichita KS I've seem them all).  For a moment I thought it might be a stealth fighter, since the nation was gearing up for the first Iraq war at the time, but the object had no wings or rotors or wheels, just a smooth oval (almond or maybe flattened egg) shape, slightly narrower in front, with a small oval bump on top.  I couldn't determine surface details since the sun was down and I could only see a black silhouette against the sky.  It made no noise, there were no lights.  When I first saw it, it was about 45 degrees up, to the west.  I estimate it was 20-30 feet wide, flying at approximately 1500' altitude moving north around 100mph (similar to a small private plane in size and speed).  I thought 'hey, I see YOU' and looked around at other people in the parking lot, no one else was watching it.  I observed it for a couple minutes until it disappeard over the horizon.  After getting home I phoned the local airport and asked if they had any strange radar images or if anyone else had reported a UFO. They acted like I was crazy so I didn't bother to notify the police. I considered the posibility that it might have been some type of balloon but it was moving much faster than the wind that night.

Object moves across sky and stops.  Minutes after, a circle of lights is seen moving in a perfect formation, then the lights converge;2002-11-06 21:05:00;OVer the course of seven ;Object moves across sky and stops.  Minutes after, a circle of lights is seen moving in a perfect formation, then the lights converge During my Astronomy session, we were told to look towards Polaris.  We did this and about 30 seconds later, noticed an object moving south.  We thought it was a plane and then it stopped.  It sat there for about 2 or 3 seconds then moved back to the north.  It moved north for about 5 seconds and then changed direction again to the south.  It did this for another 5 to 7 seconds.  Then it moved rapidly in an easterly direction and disappeared.  The object was yellow almost a gold color About 4 minutes later, I saw a circle of 6 to 8 lights (gold dots) moving at a very fast pace to the south.  These lights were very small.  I followed it in a southerly direction and then they moved out of formation and looked like they were going to dive and then they were lost in the clouds.  This last sight lasted about 10 seconds.;40.1127886178862;-88.258524390244

I was on the way to class with friend and noticed an egg shaped object hovering and what sounded like a cracking sound.   The object was too far to discern any other details.
