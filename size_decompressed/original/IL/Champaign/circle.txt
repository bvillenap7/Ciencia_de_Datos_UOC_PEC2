Giant, orange half Circle in Sky near Champaign;2017-11-15 21:00:00;2 seconds;Giant, Orange Half Circle in Sky near Champaign I was on a Greyhound going to Chicago from Champaign with my boyfriend and it was about 9pm, probably several miles away from Champaign.  We both saw a very large half circle that was orange in the sky.  I thought it was the moon at first but we saw the moon, and this was completely different.  It was very large, like almost bigger than a billboard on a highway.  I noticed another passenger was frantically looking for it as well, when it disappeared in a matter of seconds.  You saw it, blinked, and it was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));40.1127886178862;-88.258524390244
