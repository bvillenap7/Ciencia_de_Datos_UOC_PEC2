It stayed still for a few minutes and then shot across the sky towards Quincy, Illinois, which is around 20 miles away from Mendon.   As we were walking back from the graveyard, we saw the craft go the opposite way.  I have spoken with other people who live in the town, and they have seen the same thing.  I've seen this more than just this once.  It's passed over Mendon a few times before. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));40.0834;-91.2911
