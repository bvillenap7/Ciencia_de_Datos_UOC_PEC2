stationary, flat disk like shape with white red and green lights flashing intermittenly seen south of Saskatoon, April 4, 2001 1120pm;2001-04-04 23:20:00;50 minutes;stationary, flat disk like shape with white red and green lights flashing intermittenly seen south of Saskatoon, April 4, 2001 1120pm I live south west of the city of Saskatoon on an acerage and I was out side with my dog at about 11:20pm April 4,2001 and saw a multicolored light in the south east corner of the sky. Intitially I thought that it was a satelite or an airplane but it just sat there.  It appeared to be relatively flat and the colors changed from whilte to red to green. With binoculars I  was able to see more that one color  flashing intermittenly and it seemed to be spinning because the color pattern was in the same order.  it didn't apear to move for the fifty minutes or so that I watched it with my sister. I filmed it with my camcorder  and was able to get some of the color.  I went into the housefor about 20 seconds and came back and it was gone.;52.1494699570812;-106.602005579399
we thought it was a airplane until we saw it disk like shape;2001-08-18 21:57:00;53 seconds;we thought it was a airplane until we saw it disk like shape it was kinda like a colour changing disk that  was hovering.  it made noises like thunder with a gentle huming noise.  after that we called our nebouir they never saw or here'd anything!

ufo spotted over Saskatoon;2003-08-17 23:45:00;2-3 minutes;ufo spotted over Saskatoon A friend and I were sitting outside his house in the most northern community in Saskatoon. My friend looked up into the sky, and his jaw dropped.  I turned around and looked up to see what he was looking at.  I could clearly see the black silhouette of a saucer against the orange glow of the night sky.  It was a slightly cloudy night which, sometimes caused the sky to be orange at night rather than black.  Anyways, this disk had 3 flashing lights on the bottom, but each time one of the lights flashed the light was a different color.  The Disc also appeared to be flying fairly low, being that we saw it against the clouds from below supports this.  The really strange thing is that neither of us heard a thing, not the whine of a jet engine, or pulsing of a helicopter rotor, so it definately was not a plane or a helicopter.  My friend and I couldn't help but watch as this object silently flew out of site in a matter of minutes, and being in Saskatchewan it had to go a long way before it is out of site.  Neither of us had ever seen anything like it before, but this incident has opened our eyes, and we are now constatly glancing up at the sky for another glimpse.  Now I am not sure if this is the absolutely correct date, i know it was a sunday night during mid-late august.;52.1494699570812;-106.602005579399
2 White Disks over Saskatoon at 2:45AM;2009-09-26 02:45:00;Less then 10 seconds;2 White Disks over Saskatoon at 2:45AM Saturday 26th of September  UFO Sighting over Saskatoon, Saskatchewan at approximately 2:45 AM. I glanced outside my window as I lay in bed watching the Tele.  Then appeared two disk or perhaps sphere objects moving in the south direction.  They were white in colour, had a slight hue or glow to them, and perhaps quite large in size. They did not appear to be to far up in the sky and moved at quite a speed, I only saw them in my vision for about 10 seconds at the most before the objects descended in to the southern sky they disappeared behind some trees and were gone from sight. My mind raced as to what those objects could be.  They did not make a sound so I can rule out fighter jets as they frequently fly over, and rattle my apartment foundation. Since it is nearing winter I had the idea that they might be White Canada Geese flying south for winter, but their was no evidence of wings and the movement was far to fast for any bird. This is the first time in my 30+ years I've seen an Unidentified Flying Object. Since they were moving south I thought perhaps they were heading towards a military installation south of Saskatoon called Dundurn. I'm absolutely blown away.  It's to bad I wasn't more prepared to catch it on film.  I hope I'm not the only witness to this, they were very obvious and flying over one of the busiest streets in the entire province.;52.1494699570812;-106.602005579399
Possible disk, but wouldn't rule out meteorological phenomenom.;2018-06-23 21:30:00;45 minutes (approx);Possible disk, but wouldn't rule out meteorological phenomenom I was sitting in a downtown Saskatoon park listening to bands from our local jazz festival on Saturday evening.  But I was also keeping an eye on the weather, as there were thunderstorms in the forecast and the clouds had begun to look threatening. At about 9:30 pm or so, I was watching one dark cloud rolling in, nearly overhead.  As I watched, for a brief moment I saw what appeared to be the leading edge of a disk-shaped object protrude at about a 45 degree angle from the base of the cloud.  I saw it for less than a second, but it appeared as though it were a solid object with rectangular or square raised areas or panels.  Then it was suddenly shrouded in the outline of a dark cloud. Imagine a disk parallel with the ground dipping forward to poke through the clouds, resembling a flattened smile. The dark cloud followed the general outline of the that I had just seen.  I though perhaps that I may have simply seen a cloud and my mind played tricks on me.  But I kept watching it.  Over the course of the next 45 minutes or so, the curved dark cloud remained stationary, even as the stormcloud and other clouds in the sky moved steadily westward.  It also stayed the same shape and size, even as the other clouds grew changed shape.  Still, I was more or less convinced I was watching some sort of weather phenomenon. Around 10:15 pm, I watched the thin dark cloud slowly wheel in a clockwise direction, taking about 30 seconds to turn about 90 degrees from its original orientation (imagine a disk now perpendicular to the ground, with the bottom edge protruding through the clouds).  Then, it slowly slid to the southeast and retreated into the lighter stormclouds, even as those other clouds were still drifting westward on the wind. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Possible disk, but wouldn't rule out meteorological phenomenom (addendum) Addendum to my report sent a short while ago:  I forgot to give a description of the apparent size of the object (or whatever it was).  The phenomenon occurred at about 40 - 50 degrees above the horizon.  Given the low cloud cover, it would have been relatively nearby.  The length of the visible portion of the dark object (or cloud) was about equal to the width of the palm of my hand held at arm's length.  Its width would have been about as wide as my index finger held at arm's length. As I first sighted it, my initial impression was that it somewhat resembled the leading edge of the saucer section of the USS Enterprise from the 1960s original Star Trek series - a disk with a blunt leading edge.  That is one reason that I thought I might have imagined it.  It was dark, metallic gray in color. Given the curvature of the object or cloud that I watched for about 45 minutes, if it was part of a disk, the visible portion would have been about 1/8 to 1/12 of the circumference.  The rest, if it really was disk shaped, would have been above the base of the clouds. ((END ADDENDUM));52.1494699570812;-106.602005579399
