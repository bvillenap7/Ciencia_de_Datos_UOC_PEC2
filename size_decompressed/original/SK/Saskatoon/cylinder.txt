Took a video.;2016-11-10 08:34:00;2 minutes;Took a video This morning we were driving north in Saskatoon and saw an object that looked like two buses stacked on top of each other with a cylinder shaped object between it I grabbed my phone and started filming.  It went straight up and then kind of downwards to the west then south west it was way too fast to be a normal plane and planes gone go straight up.  It was hard to capture it on the phone as we could all see it with our naked eyes. It took off faster south and disappeared.  At :30 in the video you can see it.  The sky was clear no clouds nothing like we have ever seen.;52.1494699570812;-106.602005579399
