Black triangle with a white light on each point, trails from back two points;1974-09-05 21:00:00;2 Minutes;Black triangle with a white light on each point, trails from back two points The above date is approximate, I cannot for the life of me remember the exact date but this incident happened during the first week of September give or take a day or two - it was a weeknight as we had school the next day. I was 15 years old at the time. Below are the details of the sighting.  One evening in 1974, during the first week of September, myself and two friends were sitting up on the roof of my Mom and Dad's house (we would go up there for a cigarette every now and again - typical kids). It would have been about 8:30 to 9:00 PM at night - the sky was extremely clear that night. I had both my hands behind my head and was resting my head against the shingles on the roof (the roof is at angle of approx. 35 - 40 degrees). I saw a UFO - it was a perfect triangle with a white light on each point of the triangle. There were trails coming off the back two points of the triangle. The triangle was pitch black and blocked out the stars above it as it flew over top of me - it would have been about as high in the sky as a jetliner. I remember trying to convince myself at that time that maybe it was a meteor or a group of meteors of some sort (or even some sort of reflection) but I kept reminding myself that it actually blocked out the stars above me as it flew over top of me. It COULDN'T have been a meteor or a reflection. It was definitely NOT a plane. I was a smart enough kid back then to know the difference.  The triangle flew in a southwesterly direction, from northeast to southwest very, very quickly - much faster than a jetliner but slow enough to see some details. Definitely slower than any meteorite I have ever seen. I can still picture it as clear as day when I think of the sighting some 30 years later. I jumped down off the roof and went flying into the house yelling to my Mom and Dad 'I just saw a UFO!'. It was so significant to me at that time that I actually wrote down what I saw and even drew a picture of it in one of my notebooks. I remember my Mom and Dad and I calling the Saskatoon Airport that night but the airport indicated that they had received no other reports. This was something I had never seen before and have never seen since.  Having been interested in UFO's ever since that time, I recently obtained a copy of Timothy Good's book, Above Top Secret. Amazingly (which is why I am reporting this to you now, this many years later) - in Chapter 8 (Canada), I came across these two incidents in Good's book:  Page 200 ...in July 1974 a Scandinavian airlines captain flying 35 to 40 miles southeast of Quebec City reported a triangular shaped object moving in a southwesterly direction...  Page 200 - 201 ...on 10 October 1974, John Breen, a Canadian armed forces pilot, was paced by a UFO over Newfoundland, en route from Deer Lake to Gander. A passenger flying with him noticed a strange light following the plane when they were about 50 miles from Gander. Every time Breen looked at the light, it seemed to turn off but finally he got a better view of it. It seemed to be a sort of triangle - or delta shaped, luminescent greenish light following us...  Date-wise, my sighting falls in between the two above sightings. The triangle I saw was moving fast enough that it could very well have been in Quebec or in Newfoundland a few minutes beforehand (although the date of 10 October 1974 in Good's book is approx. 4 weeks after my sighting occurred). I drew a GIF animation of what I saw and will attach it to an e-mail using the address you've given below.;52.1494699570812;-106.602005579399
large floating triangle saw floating just outside of a third story window.;2002-06-15 14:30:00;60 seconds;large floating triangle saw floating just outside of a third story window. my daughter, who is 12, reported to me seeing a triangular craft moving very slowly just out side the window of the gym where we work out. She said it was about the size of a small airplane, but made no noise, moving north bound at about  10 km per hr. it would have been no more that 15 feet away from the window which is on the 3rd floor of the building which has 20 ft ceilings. She watched it for about one minute then turned to see if I was watching, which I was not, and then it was gone.;52.1494699570812;-106.602005579399
Large Black Triangle, no lights or sound, south to north, night-time, 3/4 moon, partly cloudy;2002-07-06 00:30:00;1 minute;Large Black Triangle, no lights or sound, south to north, night-time, 3/4 moon, partly cloudy While setting up a tent in the back yard with two friends, I noticed movement in the sky out of the corner of my eye.  The moon was bright, I believe it was not quite full, and there was a ridge of clouds straight above.  I noticed a triangular shape near the south horizon flying due north.  At first I thought it may be a flock of Geese, but then realized it was solid black against the sky, with dark grey or brown leading edges, there were no distinguishable lights.  I yelled and pointed to my two friends, but they could not locate it before it flew over the ridge of clouds.  It took approximately 15 seconds to fly from horizon to clouds, making absolutely no sound.  I considered that it may be a Stealth aircraft(such as F-117 nighthawk), travelling extremely slow, until I realized that the ceiling was at least 1000 ft. high, and the craft must have been considerably larger than I first estimated.  This event has perplexed me.  I am not an avid follower of military aircraft, nor do I believe extra-terrestrial involvement.  Since this event I have heard several similar stories, but have kept this description exactly as I told it to my friends the next day. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

bright object that seemed to be affected by the gusty winds ?;2002-11-29 01:30:00;min 3 hours;((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness may have been gazing at the star, Sirius.  It is in the southern sky at this hour of the morning during the winter months.  Just a guess.  We receive MANY reports of Sirius and Venus.  PD)) bright object that seemed to be affected by the gusty winds ? looking to the south, and slightly to the left and down from orions belt i noticed a bricght light. At first I thought it was a planet because it was a different intensity than the stars. But when it moved it caught my attention and I called my wife and son over.  My wife said it was a plane, but I worked around airplanes and airports for almost 20 years and I knew it was not an aircraft. There was no regular beacon and as we watched an aircraft did fly over and you could see the difference.  It was quite windy at the time with gusts of at least 40 kph and I thought it might be a helicopter because it seemed to be affected by the wind but there was no noise and it had to be at least 5 miles away, and for the size of the light, it had to be bigger than any helicopter I have ever seen.  On closer inspection, we could see it was sometimes triangular, then looked like a straight line and other times a dot.  About 15 min after I first noticed it there was a streak across the sky.  Wheter it was related to this or just a meteor i can't say.  As for colour, (I am colourblind) I deffinatly seen it as red, but overall the light in the sky was a blueish. (Kind of hard to explain.)I think it must have been rotating at times because I could see the tip of the triangle pointing to the left(east) then at other times right or down, and i thing someitmes when it turned is when it appeared to be a straight line.  I did phone the city police to ask if anyone else had reported it but noone had.  My son and I drove in our car to a place about 3 km outside of the city to get away from the light pollution and try and get a better view, but it didn't make too much of a difference, it was still hazy.  On the way out of town itI had the light on my forward left, and it was in line with the street lights and the next time I glanced up it was to my right and my son said it had shot over.  Then it shot back to where it was origionaly.  We watched it outside the city for about 20 min but the only thing that really was different wa! s that i t flashed about three times over a 15 min period.  I didn't see this but my son was saying at times that balls of light were leaving and returning from it.I called a couple of people because I wanted them to see it and not think I was making it up, but one neveranswered the phone and the second was in a location where her house was behind a highway offramp that blocked her view to the south.  I also tried to call the Saskatoon airport but only got a recording.  Since nothing extraordinary was happening and my wife thought I was nuts, I stopped watching at about 0345 and went to be.  When I arose at 0800 there was too much cloud cover to see if anything was still in the sky.;52.1494699570812;-106.602005579399
3 triangular white lights traveling too slow and too low to be a plane;2003-11-11 23:30:00;1 minute;3 triangular white lights traveling too slow and too low to be a plane The craft looked similar to the one seen on October 13 in Trenton, OH it hovered like a helecopter.  It had 3 wings each 120 degrees from each other... it had a white light on each wing, and a blinking red one in the center a four white light would turn on and then off again, maybe for thrust.  I got within 100 meters from it with my car, and it appeared to have a white body.  I figure it was a UFO because it was not a helecopter and flew too slow to be a plane.;52.1494699570812;-106.602005579399
It started to dip and dive;2004-12-25 00:00:00;10 minutes;I was walking down broadway when I spotted something in the sky ahead of me.  At first I thought it was a plane or a satelite or something.  But I quikly realized this was something out of the ordinary.  It started to dip and dive and it came at me, I reacted fast and ran to the police station and for some reason it never followed me there.  Ever since I've been having headaches.;52.1494699570812;-106.602005579399
V-shaped ufo over Saskatoon.;2012-07-29 00:35:00;30 seconds;V shaped ufo over Saskatoon It was 12:30 Saturday morning.  I went outside to have a cigarette and look at the night sky. It was a clear night with the moon in the south east of the sky.  It was a big, bright moon. There were a few light wispy clouds, but almost completely clear, dark night.  I looked at the sky for while, then let my eyes adjust by staring at a blank area of the black sky.  That's when I saw a light, it had the intensity of a brighter starlight, moving from the south. In the first instance I saw the moving light I thought it was a satellite or other regular object. I am used to seeing a variety of things in the night sky.  That is when I noticed two more exact same lights behind the first.  The lights were in a dark part of the sky with no clouds at first. I could not figure out what was moving up there. Whatever is was, it was at altitude.  The 3 lights moved in unison.  Then the craft went under a wispy cloud, and with the moon that night, it was just like someone standing up in front of a movie theater screen.  I got a clear look at the shape of the craft.  As the craft went under the cloud I saw that it was a (what I thought) was a delta shaped craft.  And I thought wow a stealth bomber must be coming in.  Then, as the craft continued under the cloud and more of it came into clear view, I noticed that it was a V shaped craft. Clearly a V, like a carpenters square.  It was not a B2 or a stealth fighter. It was big, my initial thought was that 2 747's could land on one wing of the V craft. The span from tip to tip of the rear tips had to be at least 6 or 7 747's apart. It was huge. It was not a UAV or remote controlled craft. It was at altitude and huge. It had no aviation lights, just the 3 lights that were like stars at each point of the V. When the craft went under the cloud, you could not see the 3 star lights, only the outline of the craft. As the craft left the cloud, it was like the craft went invisible again. The cr! aft continued north. As it went away, all I could see 3 glowin! g red ha lf orbs, all side by side. They glowed red, not bright red, but like a low watt red light bulb. The craft made no sound, absolutely silent. I estimate the speed to be approximately 100 to 150 mph due to distance it traveled in that time. It went perfectly straight heading south to north. I know this sounds crazy but when I see some of the images that people drew of the Phoenix Lights, I see the same thing I saw that night. It was real. It was not a plane, jet, remote UAV, or anything else I have ever seen. If I had not looked at the sky like I did that night, I would have never had known it was going over my head. I have hoped to hear of someone else in Saskatoon that saw the same thing that night but I have not. There is Sept 26/13 report on this site with a drawing by someone in Turlock, California of a V-shaped craft very similar to what I saw, but his drawing has too many lights, I saw only 3, but other that that, it was the same.;52.1494699570812;-106.602005579399

Seven of us where sitting at a fire, six of use look up and seen a V shaped object in the sky flying from west to east in a straight line for 30 seconds before it disappeared behind a building.  The object had seven White lights in the shape of a V and was travelling at an unknown distance and speed with no sound present.  All six of us that seen the object described it the same way.  Event happen to quickly to take photos.;52.1494699570812;-106.602005579399
