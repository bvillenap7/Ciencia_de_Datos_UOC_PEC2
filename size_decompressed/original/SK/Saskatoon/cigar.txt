PI was having breakfast by myself in a restaurant in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, CANADA, on Nov.11, 1989(rememberance day in Canada).  My chair was facing north when during my breakfast around 11:30 a.m.  I noticed an object in the completely cloudless sky.  It appeared at about 70 degrees in the sky.  It was in the shape of a long cigar or cylinder shape. It's color was somewhat like that of a cloud or very light grey.  I used a chimney on a building across the street as a reference point.  It seemed to be a very great distance in the sky maybe 30 miles away.  It did not move for the approximately 60 minutes I watched it.  I thought it would move or be blown about by the wind but it didn't move an inch.It had perfectly outlined and smooth sharp edges.  I stayed as long as i could to watch it hoping it would disappear or move away but it didn't, and at this time I had to leave my table.  I would have asked someone to verify the sighting but I thought people might think I was crazy so I didn't.  Maybe I should have.  Sincerely, ((name deleted));52.1494699570812;-106.602005579399
