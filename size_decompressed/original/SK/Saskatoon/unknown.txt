Two red flashing objects traversed the sky from east to north in about 40 seconds.;2012-08-27 21:27:00;80 seconds;Two red flashing objects traversed the sky from east to north in about 40 seconds. Two objects appeared at about 45 degrees above the horizon - in the eastern sky. There were separated by about 20 degrees on the horizontal.  They at first appeared to be planes (flashing red and organge lights) coming in to land to the airport in the north part of the city - but then continued quickly in a straight line at very fast rate - directly north. From the moment they appeared, at a due easterly direction, until they quickly faded to the north, only about 40 seconds passed. Estimated speed =  1,000KM/hr ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));52.1494699570812;-106.602005579399
((Starlink satellites??));2019-12-28 19:30:00;15 minutes;I went outside at 7:30 pm to have a cigarette.  As usual I look up at the stars while I'm outside.  At first everything seemed normal and a few minutes later I spotted what I thought was a satellite approaching from the western sky.  I soon realized it was not a satellite as approximately 50 to 60 of the same size objects appeared right behind the first one. All at the same speed and all approx. the same distance apart.  I called my wife and a neighbour to witness the activity.  I'm not quite sure why but I feel completely panicked and want to tell everyone I know.  I watch a lot of ufo shows on tv but have never heard a report of this many ufo's at one time. S ounds crazy, I would have thought so myself if i had not witnessed it myself. Governments have been lying to us all along. SHIT.;52.1494699570812;-106.602005579399
