Grey dot or circle inside smoke ring cloud;2004-07-30 12:30:00;1:00 minute;Grey dot or circle inside smoke ring cloud I work out of my home. Earlier today, I decided to take advantage of sunny conditions to go work outside, so I took my notebook computer out to the back patio and set it up. Although the day had started clear, thunderclouds started building up before noon. Much of the sky to the north was cloudy, but the sky to the south was clear. The stormclouds were well defined. There wasn't much overcast or haze, just stormcloud or clear blue sky. I need to take frequent breaks when working on the computer outside, because of glare on the display. So, at one point, I leaned back and looked straight up into the sky. I noticed that there was a very well defined thundercloud to the north, scattered cloud overhead and blue sky west and east. Directly overhead, there was what looked like a smoke ring, about the size of my thumbnail held at arm's length. It was perfectly circular and appeared to be swirling inward on itslelf. In the centre of the smoke ring was a grey dot or small circle. At first, the dot was almost as large as the area inside the smoke ring, about the size of a fingernail at arm's length. Over the next several seconds, the grey dot appeared to get smaller, then disappeared. The smoke ring remained, but gradually (over about a minute or so) dissipated.;52.1494699570812;-106.602005579399
Very bright, circular object in evening sky;2004-10-01 23:15:00;5-7 seconds;Very bright, circular object in evening sky It was around 11:15pm and I went outside to sit on my backstep to make a phone call.  I looked around at my surrondings like I usually do and out of nowhere a very bright and extremely big circular object moved in the sky. Also the evening was a bit cloudy but this object was like a jewel among the darkness for a few seconds that it appeared. It moved so fast and within seconds it disappeared as fast as it appeared. I really do not know what I saw but from my distance it was high in the sky but it was so big that I could see how bright it was and that it was round in shape. I figure if this was a shooting star or satellite it would have left a trail to follow but this did not. I came in to tell my family immediately because I was not sure what to think. I also believe it was just pure chance that I saw this because it happened so quick. I would normally not go online to tell this story but I thought it might be important for you to know.;52.1494699570812;-106.602005579399
5 to 7 circular objects, moving in a triangular formation, at a very methodical speed.;2020-08-11 23:20:00;7 seconds;5 to 7 circular objects, moving in a triangular formation, at a very methodical speed. So last night I went out to watch the night sky for falling stars/meteorites. In the course of 1/2hr I saw at least 1dozen stars, that were travelling slowly and very very far up in space. These were small to see as they were very far away.  I also saw falling meteorites with bright tail lights that would quickly fizzle out. The interesting part of the night that I experienced was at roughly 11:20pm.  As I was laying in the park looking up into the night sky, I noticed what I initially thought was 5 to 7 geese flying in a V shaped formation, however as I sat up and starred more intently I realized it was not geese .  There was no noise and no identifiable flapping of wings.  The objects were circular in shape, and had a brownish hue, with very slight aura of diffused light around.  There was no real identifiable tail light of bright colour, and this formation flew what seemed to be very methodical, and did not break its flying formation for the quick time that I witnessed it.  (7seconds).  This did not seem to be a satellite or a star or a broken up meteorite. I can only describe it the way I witnessed it.  It flew from, Eastward  to Westward .  I only wish I would have had been recording with my cell phone.  The only other object in the sky that appeared after my sighting was the local Police Traffic Plane that circles the town,  I am wondering if they saw anything, it was very close to the time frame I am referencing.;52.1494699570812;-106.602005579399
