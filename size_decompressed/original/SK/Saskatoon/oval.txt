300-400 ft long, oval and orange did not move or make any noise at all;1996-06-15 21:30:00;3-4 minutes;300-400 ft long, oval and orange did not move or make any noise at all It was about 9:00 p.m. I was walking across the street to get a movie for a 9 y/o I was babysitting for, I was about 21. Across the street is a little strip mall and above it was this huge, gigantic orange oval shaped object. It was totally silent did not move, it was like it was drawn on the sky. I was terrified. But for some reason the boy did not see it. I did not mention anything to him as to scare him. But you definatly could not miss it. We went into the store no one said a thing. This ufo was just about as big as the strip mall and the strip mall is about 500 to 600 ft long. when we got out of the store it was gone. I didn't say a word to anyone but hopefully waited to see if any one had seen anything. Unfortunatly no one said a thing. This is the second sighting I've seen of an orange ufo. I have never heard of one being orange. The first time I seen an ufo it was white moveing slowly across the sky and the whole thing turned orange and left. ((NUFORC Note:   Date is approximate.

Silvery white, oval object over the clouds.;2000-05-25 20:00:00;approx 2 minutes;Silvery white, oval object over the clouds. 2 family members and I were coming home from Ontario and about 5 minutes out of Saskatoon I started to get bored again so I looked up to make things out of the clouds!...I looked up at about a 60Degree angle when I saw an almost football shaped craft but the edges were more rounded then norm. It was an almost pure white,but had a little silver. It didn't look as though the object was moving so I kinda thought it was a balloon but the winds were strong outside so if it was a balloon it would have moved faster, but in the sky it was the size of a balloon about 50 meters up...when the coulds moved towards it I saw that the clouds were below it and not above!! that's when I knew it had to be big,and that it was not a natural craft that you see above the clouds!{it looked about the distance a large jetliner would normally be above the clouds}..I tryed to show my family members but when I looked up I had lost it! and I knew the cloud that it was behind..so it had to move fast when I was not looking for the 5 seconds!! ((NUFORC Note:  Please see report from Ketchikan, AK, for same date.  Approximately 30 objects, in a large, horseshoe-shaped formation, were photographed to the west of Ketchikan at approximately sunset.  PD));52.1494699570812;-106.602005579399
