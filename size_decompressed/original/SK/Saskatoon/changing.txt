hazy yellow-orange light(s) that changed shape and moved fluidly;2010-10-01 21:00:00;30-60 seconds;hazy yellow-orange light(s) that changed shape and moved fluidly It was approximately 9pm on October 1, 2010. I was outside in my backyard with my dog, and as I waited for him I was glancing around at the stars. Movement in the east caught my attention. Above the city lights, perhaps around airplane height or a bit lower, I could see a soft orangey-yellow, self-illuminated object that moved like a piece of silky fabric in the wind. It was very faintly lit, so it was sometimes difficult to see against the light coming up from the city, but I watched it for about 30 seconds as it moved into the wind away from me and then disappeared. A couple times I thought I could see three brighter lights within the glowing haze that moved and “danced” around each other. The flowing movement of the light made it appear to change shape as it went. It was not moving across the sky fast enough to be a meteor, and it was not traveling in a straight path. It meandered. The size of the object was large enough that at first I thought I was seeing a large bird swooping around, or a plastic bag blowing in the wind...but as I said, it was moving against the wind and it was self-illuminated. Afterwards I told myself I must have seen some Northern Lights activity, but I have never been able to see them from the city before, and the light was only visible in that one spot. 	I could hear an airplane flying somewhere directly above me but did not see one. The object did not have airplane lights, and did not move like any aircraft I have ever seen, though I am by no means an expert on aircraft.  There is a military base south of the city, but this is the first time I have witnessed something questionable.  I am 29 years old and I work in veterinary medicine. I am the type of person who demands proof before I believe anything, but I just can't explain what I saw.;52.1494699570812;-106.602005579399
Black ufo appears in sky after loud bang, and disappears after flying into a bright red shimmering portal.;2020-04-09 00:00:00;&gt10 seconds;Black ufo appears in sky after loud bang, and disappears after flying into a bright red shimmering portal. I was sitting outside in my hottub when all of a sudden i heard a loud bang coming from the north west.  I followed my vision to the sound only to see a black object zooming through the sky toward the east and then disappearing through a circular object that looked like a portal.  From what i could see since it happened so quickly, the object was entirely black or casted in shadow and appeared to be in the shape of an elongated rectangle.  This portal object was glowing red with sparks coming off of it and when the black zooming image flew into it, both disappeared and everything became silent.  The sky was dark so i was unable to see if anything was leftover in the sky.;52.1494699570812;-106.602005579399
