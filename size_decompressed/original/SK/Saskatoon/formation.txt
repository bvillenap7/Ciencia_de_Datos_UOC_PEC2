I was sitting outside on my steps looking up at the sky when I thought at first I was seeing a shooting star. Immediately I realized that it was not one but a satellite. I was looking South East when I first saw the object. It was travelling at a fairly fast rate of speed from East to West at about 75 to 80 degrees above the horizon. I then saw following the object 3 more lights of the exact same size in a V formation following the first object, moving at the exact same speed and at the same height in the sky. Then following the first group of 3 was another group of 3 lights in a V formation following the previous lights at the same speed and in the same position in the sky. All the lights were of the same intensity and appeared to be somewhat blurred. They did not strobe so I assume they were not airplanes. I got off the steps and followed them moving in the sky until the street light from behind a tree made it impossible to track them. I was wearing a personal CD player so I did not hear if there was any sound or not. My impression was they were flying very high in the sky.;52.1494699570812;-106.602005579399
Three blue lights chasing each other  ((NUFORC Note:  Advertising lights.  PD));2004-10-19 20:00:00;unknown;While driving home from a restaurant this evening, my daughter and I witnessed what appeared to be three blue lights chasing each other. They seemed to be in a tringle formation at first, then these lights began moving very fast, at first I thought  we were seeing spotlights. However, I realized that they probably were not due to the fact that they were following the car while they were chasing one another. Also, they seemed to zoom in and out, causing an interesting perception of distance in relation to the activity displayed. First they were to the left of the drivers side, then they came around to the front, then circled around the vehicle. One of the lights then began to appear yellow in colour, then blue again. I began to get a bit nervous (wondering if the lights could be following us), and decided to take the next turn during the drive home. My daughter said that the lights were following us. I did my best to ignore them, and about five minutes later she said they were gone. We made a call to tell my mom, she called back two hours later stating that she and my dad could see these lights as they drove home from a relatives house. Our locations are  on opposite sides of the city. 17 years ago, aparantly, there had been strange lights reported in the sky on October 19th. I know this because my dad celebrated his 40th birthday on the day my cousin was boarn, 17 years ago. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness might have observed advertising lights.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) This message is a follow-up to the message I'd just sent in regard to the three blue lights in the sky. I've just learned that there is a light show going on in honour of the Syncrotron centre here in the city. It will be going on every night this week from 7pm - midnight. Please disregard my previous message. Thanks. ((END));52.1494699570812;-106.602005579399
