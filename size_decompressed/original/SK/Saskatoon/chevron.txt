Wedge or chevron shaped object passed in front of crescent moon.;2001-09-22 20:00:00;5 - 7 seconds;Wedge or chevron shaped object passed in front of crescent moon. I was looking out our living room window at the crescent moon, when I suddenly saw an object pass in front of the moon. The object appeared wedge-shaped, but was notched or open at the back (giving it a bit of a chevron shape). It passed the tip of the crescent moon travelling west to east and was as tall as about 1/8 to 1/6 of the moon's diameter. The moon was surrounded by a halo that was about three times the moon's diameter, and the object was silhouetted by the moon and surrounding halo, giving me about 5 - 7 seconds to watch it. It was moving faster than a jet would appear to move at high altitude, but perhaps as fast as a jet appears to move at a lower altitude. Since it was silhouetted by the moon's halo, it must have been travelling below the high level cloud that created the halo. It may well have been an aircraft, especially since aircraft regularly travel east and west in this portion of the sky, but I was struck by the apparent lack of a fuselage. As soon as I saw it, I ran to the window and cupped my hands against the glass to block out any extraneous light and watched the sky for signs that it might have been an aircraft. I was unable to see any moving lights in the sky near the approximate path the object was travelling. My wife and I were waiting for a television program to start, so I am positive of the time (a few seconds before 8:00 pm CST). Unfortunately, I was unable to draw my wife's attention to the object fast enough.;52.1494699570812;-106.602005579399
Blueish white light which appeared to 'cloak itself'.;2008-06-28 22:30:00;3 seconds;Blueish white light which appeared to 'cloak itself'. Witnessed a large blueish tinged bright white light for a few seconds before it appeared to 'cloak' itself. It looked like it was passing under a cloud but there were no clouds.Viewing conditions were excellent,no clouds,wind,many visible stars.;52.1494699570812;-106.602005579399
Five lights flying in a V-formation.;2013-08-30 22:30:00;5 seconds;Five lights flying in a V-formation. I seen 5 whitish lights flying in a v-formation. They were travelling south to north. This is the third time I have seen this formation in the last month.  The firt two times the v-formation was tight, the third time I could tell that they were moving independently of one another.  They crossed the entire sky in about 4-5 seconds.  I cannot find a rational explanation of what the lights are.;52.1494699570812;-106.602005579399
