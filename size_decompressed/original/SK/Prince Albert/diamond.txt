The shape appeared to be diamond, but also appeared to change shape. Distance was a factor in our views of it, causing each of us to see differently. When first noticed the lights thought it was a star or a sattilite, but relized that the light was to bright to be either and it was constantly changing colors.  They appeared to move in a westerly direction and I believe I saw something shoot off to the left and to the right of the object.  I believe the colors to have been  Red, Green, Yellow, Blue, White, And the shape seemed to me to be a diamond.  Can't be certain of it though, seeing as my wife believes she seen a constantly changing shape. At the time of the occurance, My satillite reciever began to lose the signal, then turned off two or three times had some problems turning it back on. After the last time it turned off and got it to turn on again, happened to look out the window (faces south) and seen the lights.  I then proceded to call my sister and have her confirm what I was seening.
