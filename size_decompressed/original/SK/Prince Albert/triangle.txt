A bright halogen like light listed lazily in a 10 degree area near direct overhead.;2016-11-15 18:00:00;30 minutes;A bight halogen like light listed lazily in a 10 degree area near direct overhead. The light listed lazily left to right in a region of about ten degree in radius overhead near dusk slightly to the SW.   My acreage is far away from noise and lights and used faint stars to track its motion.  There was no sound coming from the object and from time to time came to a complete standstill.  With binoculars the object appeared as a bright halogen light.  Once cloud cover appeared below the light it admitted a triangular glow.  The cloud cover eventually obscured the light.  The viewing went from clear sky to full cloud cover in the 30 minute viewing.;53.2039389610389;-105.757127272727
