Elongated white object in the early evening.;2017-03-09 18:35:00;2 minutes;Elongated white object in the early evening. Saw a white object in the sky toward the northeast.  The object was far off and in photos looks elongated vertically and did not appear to be moving.   It did not shine like a light but was more solid white in colour.  Could not make out a solid shape as it was quite far off, but looked to be wider in the center with elongated parts pointing up and down from the middle point.;53.2039389610389;-105.757127272727
