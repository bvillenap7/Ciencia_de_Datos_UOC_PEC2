Red light spotted 5 times in about 15 minutes in the southern sky.;2014-08-24 22:15:00;15 minutes;red light spotted 5 times in about 15 minutes in the southern sky We noticed a fairly bright red light in the southern sky moving from east to west, thought maybe it was a plane, about 3 minutes later it was back again in roughly the same position.  The next time it appeared I went outside for a better look and to try and determine if I could identify what I was seeing, there was no noise and it was approximately 5 km away it turned south and I lost track of it, went back in the house and it showed up 2 more times for a total of 5 times so am not sure if this was the same vehicle or 5 separate?;53.2039389610389;-105.757127272727
