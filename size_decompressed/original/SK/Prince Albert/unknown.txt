For the north about 30,000 at the time I guess.  I had gone to the store for a walk mostly.  And I heard the neighbors dog whining and whimpering.  I had taken one route to the store, (a lady from the block let me cut through her yard as long as I didn't break anything) and cut back through an empty lot to get to my street.  That's when the dog started freaking out barking at something else.  There was a pile of old telephone poles at the end of this street and it was already pretty dark out.  And u seen it crouched over between these power poles and the fence of my neighbor two doors down..  I didn't know what it was, I was uneasy.  I think I surprised it or something because my legs were wanting to run but I froze.  The minute I thought about running it looked at me and came up to the edge of the power poles..  Leering over the top of them.  I only caught a glimpse of a..  Heart shaped head..  Sort of. With big eyes.  Just looking at me.  I'm not sure what happened but I felt fear, like it meant me harm.  Then the two neighborhood dogs started snapping like when you walk by their yard.  Defensively and I ran..  It pursued me to the end of the lot.  I ran home to and locked every door behind me.  A few minutes later the dogs stopped barking all together for a few hours.  Like a wolf was just around or something..;53.2039389610389;-105.757127272727
Bright pulsating light moving in the sky then stopping and disappearing off in the distance.;2012-06-20 00:00:00;20 seconds;Bright pulsating light moving in the sky then stopping and disappearing off in the distance. At about midnight or 12:30 I saw a pulsating light moving across the sky...It was moving across the sky, it got brighter, then dim, bright, then dim, then it stopped in mid-flight got really bright for about a second and a half, and then it quickly disappeared off into the distance it faded and faded until it got smaller and smaller disappeared completely.  It look as if it was a pulsating star in the sky except for it moving across the sky very vividly pulsating and then stopping in mid-flight and disappearing it got very bright in the end. I will note that their were no insects around At ALL and normally i can walk their because the mosquitoes are too thick....
