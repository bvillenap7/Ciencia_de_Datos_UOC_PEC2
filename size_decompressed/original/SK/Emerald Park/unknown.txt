On Monday July 6, 2020 at 11:20 pm local time I watched the sky 90 degrees directly above me.  I saw a light in the sky, what I thought was a satellite approaching from the East heading on a North East path. The light then turned north and made a “C” turn back to its regular path.  I adjusted my viewing location thinking that I had seen something that cannot happen.  From there the object headed south in another “C” turn.  This is now an “S” shaped path in the sky and it did this one more time before I lost contact in the sky. It lasted no more than 20 seconds and I could not locate it in the sky with my smart phone. I did not see any blinking lights or hear any jet sound as it passed as one would with planes flying overhead. It was a faint light like satellites I see in the sky every night, I just saw it turn and I don't think that is possible.  I am hoping you would be able to provide me some sort of explanation or answer. Below is a (very) crude drawing of the path I observed.
