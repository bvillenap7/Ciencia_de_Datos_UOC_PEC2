sighting at anglo rouyn mine in the early 1970' s in norhtern sk.;1971-01-10 20:00:00;5 minutes;sighting at anglo rouyn mine in the early 1970' s in norhtern sk. i was 7 or 8 eights old and sliding with my around 6 to 8 friends in the evening at the old anglo rouyn mine site some 35 miles north of La Ronge, Sk., i was pulling my tobaggon up the hill when i noticed that the others on top of the small hill were pointing at something over the horizon to the west, when i got to the top of the hill, everyone was talking and excited, just ahead of us there were approx. 6 - 10 shining blue lights in the sky just above the treeline, there was no noise that i can recall, just the cold wind in the winter, in the summer there is an old road/trail in that location, i stood and wathced it for i do not recall how long along with some of the other kids, a couple of them ran down the hill to the trailers we all lived in, which was just below us, to tell there parents, anyways i do not know who else seen those lights, but it has always been a vivid memory for me, i have told many people over the years but have not reported it till now, i wonder if any one else has to this point, i would like to undergo an hyponitic session to see if i can recall anymore of this episode, beyond what i can remember, i seen this as a child and i believe in the instincts of children, absolutely! so if anyone can follow this up to any degree, it would be appreciated, not only out of curisoity, but also for confirmation, if this was or has been reported by anyone else that resided in anglo rouyn mine at that time in the early 1970's.;55.0971;-105.2971
