They appeared as satilites, each was one single white dot!  ((Starlink satellites??));2019-12-27 19:30:00;1-2 minutes;They appeared as satilites, each was one single white dot! On this date, Dec 27th, 2019, at approx.. 7:30 pm,  I was feeding feral cats at a dark location, I looked up in the sky, looking to the south, I saw a couple of flashing lights and they quit flashing, but I noticed what looked like a single satellite moving from north to south. approx. 10 seconds later another was on the same course, and every 5 seconds was another, I started counting and a 29 the last one was going over.  I don't know if the went above clouds as I could not se them any more.  This was a first for me to see and have know idea how else to explain it.  Any explanation would be great.;52.4812;-105.7171
