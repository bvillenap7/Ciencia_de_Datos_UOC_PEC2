Ok I was waiting for my friend because we we’re going to a party together, she called me and I told her I was going to wait for her out side and I went for a walk to a local convenience store. I was almost there but she texted me and called me so I ran back but then her plans changed so I just laid on my sisters car to wait for her, in front of her house there is a light that flickers on and off, like a street light. I was laying there and it went off and my eyes got used to the darkness so was star gazing like I do all the time, the light flickered back on and a couple minutes later went off, I looked into the sky I saw this object flying above my head, it was shaped like a comet but not really because I think it was like a barrier because it was moving way to slow. I was like WTF!? It was really high and it wasn’t shaped like a bird or plane, it reflected the light the way a cloud does at night over a city and it started turning but I followed it, tree obstructed my view so I had to if I wanted to get a better look. I went into my sister’s neighbor’s yard and continued to watch it until I couldn’t see it anymore. I walked back to my sisters car and my friend came to pick me up and I left.;52.8657;-104.5987
