At first I thought it was a plane or jet  but where I live we see alot of air craft 'and after about 5 seconds I knew it was not a plane or jet or weather balloon  now this was   while we were driving home ' I was traveling very slow  going west . the object was traveling east 'it must have been huge because at the hight the object was traveling must have been the up in the stratisphere yet it was as clear as red wood in a corn field .  It moved from horizen to horizen in two minute's it was Cylindrical'silver and very big.  I stoped my car as it passed straight over us and analized it being careful to remember every detail as it moved right out of sight.  It changed its course and moved in an angleabout 35 degrees upward and continued right out of sight...... ((NUFORC Note:  We have amended the date above to 10/16/05.  PD));52.646;-106.3343
