I was getting out of the chair after switching off the TV, when a bright light caught my eye. I looked through the window and saw what looked like a cigar shaped with a middle fin descending, it was silvery in colour. I watched it until it disappeared behind the tree line. I then ran outside but saw nothing. It was a very clear starry night. I have never seen anything like this before. Next day I phoned the observatory at the University in Saskatoon. I left a message telling them what I saw, but have never heard anything back;52.646;-106.3343
