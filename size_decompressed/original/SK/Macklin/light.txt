Quick moving bright white light.  Seen by 2 people;2018-07-20 23:30:00;3-4 minutes;Quick moving bright white light. Seen by 2 people There was a bright white light brighter than anything else in the sky and it was moving very quickly and it was not moving in a straight line, it seemed to waver from side to side at times.  It moved across the sky.  We are certain that it was low enough to be in our atmosphere and it was way brighter than any stars.  We watched it for about 4 minutes until it was out of our sight.;52.3351;-109.9513
