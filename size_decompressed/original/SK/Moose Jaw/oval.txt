It was a pretty nice night, kind of warm, hardly any clouds. We were standing by my house when I seen something flash out of the corner of my eye. I turned, and seen an ovalish-silver thing floating in the sky. I said, Do you guys see that silver thing? both of my friends said they did see it. We kind of watched it for a few minutes, not knowing what it was. It didn't make any sound, there was no smoke trail or anything. It looked like as if it was flashing every now and then. I ran into my house, got my video camera and told my mother to come outside to see this thing. I filmed it until it dissapeared into some pink clouds with a flash. We went to the park down my street and stood in a soccer field trying to see it. We were there for a good 20 minutes, when we decided to go to a much bigger farmer's field to try and see it. Well about half a block away from the field, one friend spotted it again. It was going much slower and a few times it looked like it stopped moving. I started taping again, but it was farther away and was dissapearing. We filmed until we couldn't see it anymore.;50.392325;-105.559075
