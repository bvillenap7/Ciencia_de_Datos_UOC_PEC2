Buffalo Pound Lake lies in a NW to SE direction. Co-ordinates for cabin: N 50 40’ 37.68” W 105 32’ 39.84” I have a wharf at our cabin and almost every night I will be looking to the heavens watching for satellites and/or meteorites or whatever else may be in the night skies. At this particular time (~1215 AM Sunday, August 7th, 2010), I noticed what I thought was a satellite travelling from the NW to SE direction. The ~ approximate location of the siting was almost directly between the last 2 stars of the “handle” of the Big Dipper and travelling at a satellite type speed.  Then the siting slowed down in speed, veered slightly to my right (towards the second last star of the handle) , appeared to stop, then continued forward (slowly) then veered slightly to my left ( towards the last star of the handle) then veered slightly back to my right again, going very slowly  then out rightly stopped.  The siting may have stopped for ~ 10 seconds. Then the siting just sped-up very quickly in a North Westerly direction and disappeared into the heavens.  The total length of time for this siting was ~ 10 minutes duration. At no time did the siting seem to pass beyond the artificial boundary of the last 2 stars of the Big Dipper. The siting seemed to be ~ the same brightness as the last star of the Big Dipper. I did not see any flashing or colored lights.;50.392325;-105.559075
