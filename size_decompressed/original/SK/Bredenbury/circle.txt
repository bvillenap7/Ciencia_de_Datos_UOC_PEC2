A family of 5, father, mother, two daughters, and a son witnessed an orange ball floating across the sky, followed shortly after by a second ball.   They flew directly over top of us , from North to South.   We first noticed the first one when we were pulling into our small town of Bredenbury ,Saskatchewan. We stopped our mini van and attempted to photograph it, but the photographs didnt turn out, unfortunately because the camera was set at the wrong setting .;50.9333;-102.0333
