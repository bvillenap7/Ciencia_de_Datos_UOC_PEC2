UFO sighting Fall of 2007   I was driving with my family, there was 7 of us in the car.  We looked out in front of the windshield and noticed a huge disk shaped  multi colored object moving slowly across the sky.  It was as big as a Air Canada jumbo plane and it was so low it was just above roofs of houses it flew by.  This is the first time any of us ever seen anything like this.  It was hard to believe . We asked around if anybody in our area spotted one and there were numerous sightings but no one knows where to report such a sighting.  As i was driving practically underneath it we all seen the under Neath of it . It was like the movies where you could clearly see the lights were red,blue,green,yellowish/orange, and in the middle of it glowed a bright light ,you could see  the part that zaps people up ,i donâ€™t know any other way to explain it. But my mother and auntie live in the country and they say every 3 days a bright circle object lands in a field and remains hovering not far from the earth from 3 am ! till 5 am before sunrise and at the end of it three or more little objects shoot out from it in every direction. But that sighting i have never witnessed but my mother would give more detail of that event.;52.7863000000001;-108.288
