A Large Bright Red Glowing Light.;2013-12-31 21:05:00;5 minutes;North East of North Battleford, Saskatchewan, a large bright red glowing light was seen, moving East across the sky getting less bright (further away?).  Approximately 5 minutes from time of sighting to disappearing (too far away?).  It turned white just before disappearing.  We know the difference between an Airplane, Jet or Satellite, planet or star.  This was too big for any of those.  If I held a ruler about 2 feet in front of my face, the light would measure at least .5 inches across.   Please get in touch with me, I would like to see if anyone else reported such a sighting. Thank you, ((name deleted));52.7863000000001;-108.288
