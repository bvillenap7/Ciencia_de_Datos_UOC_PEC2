Heading North on Hwy 11 to Saskatoon from Regina. I was the passenger in the car while my wife was driving and my daughter was in the rear seat.  I pointed out to them that there was a super bright star in the eastern sky.  I watched it for 3 or 4 minutes before I realized the object was coming towards us.  The object came very close and then hovered there for a few seconds.  It was extremely bright and diamond shaped.  Again I mentioned this to the people in the car.  They all saw the object and before we knew it the object headed south towards Regina at an incredible rate of speed and disappeared from view.;51.2667;-105.9667
