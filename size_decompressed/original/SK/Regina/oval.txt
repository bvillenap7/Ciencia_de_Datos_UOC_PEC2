Orange light in sky.;2015-09-28 20:20:00;3 minutes;Orange light in sky. Last night @ approx. 8:20pm, my husband requested my presence out on the deck.   Upon my meeting him on the deck, he pointed out to me a bright orange light hovering over our street.  Not a plane, not a chopper, not a hot air balloon.  Very quiet, no noise.   I ran into the house to get my camera, when I came out it was gone.   I wonder if anyone else viewed this big bright orange light.;50.4498398706898;-104.612845689656
