Orange coulored objects flying in hourglass formation;2006-05-21 23:10:00;20 sec.;Orange coulored objects flying in hourglass formation These craft crossed over head in a hourglass formation the inner craft were not flying very stable they seemed too almost run into each other! Each one was shaped like a vee with an M shape on rear they were a constant orange colour. They travelled fast, four times faster than any commercial aircraft seen in area earlier .From where we stood the formation was about two inches long ,no noise was heard. They were heading in a northwest direction  and were visible by the orange colour as they got farther away . The sky condition was clear !;50.4498398706898;-104.612845689656
Extremely fast craft with the appearance of six standard aircraft connected at the wings;2009-07-17 00:00:00;3-4 seconds;Extremely fast craft with the appearance of six standard aircraft connected at the wings My first UFO sighting in all my 50 years,,,  I was sitting on my deck last night around midnight (July 17) looking at the constellations when I observed an extremely fast moving object directly overhead, heading in a northerly direction. It appeared to be at a very high altitude and was moving so quickly that I could only see it for perhaps 3-4 seconds before it disappeared into the dark horizon. I could not hear any sound coming from the object – it appeared to be totally silent. It flew in a straight line, heading north, and was moving far too quickly to be of human origin (in my experience). It was difficult to gauge the object’s size as altitude was impossible to ascertain. My guess is that it was very large. Colour appeared to be whitish, or perhaps it was emitting a dull white light. Shape was nothing like any UFO’s I’ve heard about. This one looked like about six standard shaped aircraft joined wing to wing (they were definitely connected - it was a single craft) and flying in a perfectly straight line at incredible speed. Never seen anything like it and cannot explain it. The impression I had was that it was simply flying past the planet on the way to somewhere else because the speed and altitude was so extreme. When it disappeared into the horizon, I had the impression it was long gone…  No one else witnessed this and no photographs (sadly).;50.4498398706898;-104.612845689656
