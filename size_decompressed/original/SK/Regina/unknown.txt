Two dots in sky. One was shiny and both did not move - watched for over 20 seconds before losing them.;2006-09-16 14:00:00;20 seconds;Two dots in sky. One was shiny and both did not move - watched for over 20 seconds before losing them. 2 dots in sky.  One was shiny which made me look without the camera.  I was taking pictures to make a panorama image of my neighbourhood.   I viewed them not moving and assumed they were air planes moving either towards or away from me.   I watched for about 20 seconds and since they did not make sense in my view, I ignored them and continued to take the rest of the panorama images.   I did look around for a neighbour as another witness, but no one was currently outside.   The observer is a male, 44 years old, and never witnessed something so weird or out of place before. This is not near an airport and not in any flight path of air craft. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));50.4498398706898;-104.612845689656
The Mother ship and her babies....;2008-08-12 02:00:00;1 hour;The Mother ship and her babies.... Me and a friend were walking through park and talking about a new business venture we were investing in, and it was at night we mostly conversed because at those times there were no interruptions or phone calls. It was calm, warm, and the sky was crystal clear, and I noticed some unusually bright star in the Northern Horizon, about two hands high if measured by my hand. This star was active with red, blue, and green flashes normally associated with some stars we see at night due to our limited vision and anomalies associated with planets such as Mars or Venus. I joking said to my friend ..``LOOK`` `THERE IS THE MOTHER SHIP`.. I stared at this anomalie because I never seen such a bright star in  that position in the Horizon before, and much to my amazement I saw a single star, moving from the West sky towards this bright object and it stayed in a motionless position for just a second, went out and than reappeared at a distance closer to the flashing star that was positioned in the North (the bright colored flashing star like object). The much to my amazement and surprise I seen another star from the east, one from overhead, and a one from beneath this Colored star doing the same thing as to appear, then dissipate (unlit), only to be positioned closer to what I will call the mother ship until the lights went and they became one. In the Western night sky I see the same type of colored star but t did not move so I did not know if it was a UFO or planet. To this day my friend will not talk about it, and I do not feel surprised or shocked at what I saw. I have has different experiences with unidentified objects in the past, and near my city, we have the CFB forces Moose jaw air base only 50 miles away. I will submit my experience with what I thought was Stealth technology in a different forum. I also have anomalies in my forehead and an object in my arm behind my elbow that I want to get looked at, and the one on my arm has been there since I was little. Why these things do not scare or shock me is beyond my own reason, and why do  accept them and think this is just a normal thing in my life is quite weird don`t you think....
