First 1 BIG light came on ( just like on night landings at the airport) then 2 // big lights in an horizontal fashion came one these lights were replaced by the initial BIG approaching light then 2 big lights in a vertical position came on, then the format changed to correspond to a drawn out crescent of the first day of a new moon, all light up with some 4 or more lights in the form of that new moon crescent. the craft made an elluiptical curve like on a rounded cone, starting from the NE in the eastern skies spend about 20 minutes in my view and then cruved an exit on SE.

Bright disk-shaped object in the sky;2016-10-02 17:45:00;5 minutes;Bright disk-shaped object in the sky Husband and I were on highway 48 between Davin and White City near Regina. Spotted a bright light in the sky.  As we drew closer we realised the light was hovering.  The object was disk shaped (the light dimmed and we could see the body of the object more clearly). It kept pace with the car for a minute or so.  Then as we watched it got smaller and smaller, as if moving upwards, and then disappeared.;50.4498398706898;-104.612845689656
