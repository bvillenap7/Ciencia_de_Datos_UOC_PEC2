Stationary Lights which then separated and disapeared;1978-07-15 22:30:00;3-4 minutes;Stationary Lights which then separated and disapeared The two objects would be best described as simply a standard brightness and shape of a star or satellite with the same appearance and characteristics. Position of objects were directly above and slightly south.  Weather and visibility were excellent with no cloud cover.  What I saw  started out as two stationary lights that when looking at seemed to be about an inch apart. These two lights then began to move in straight lines in opposite directions, one moved west and one went east.  I thought initially my eyes were playing tricks on me and really only one was moving giving the appearance of the other moving.  I watched both for at least several minutes as each disappeared   much like how a satellite would at the same speed, etc.  It would be interesting if anyone could explain or give me some sort of explanation.

It was in view just above the roof top of my neighbour's house which is across the back laneway from my house. The object appeared to remain motionless. I thought it was the lights of an airline coming straight at me, which would give the appearance of a stationary object. It did not fly over me however, and remained in the sky in the same spot for about 45 minutes. At 4:45 a.m. I called to Regina City Police to report a strange object in the sky and a police car was dispatched to investigate. The object began to emit a red light on either side, so it appeared as a white light between to red lights. At 5:15 a.m. the object was still in the same spot in the sky but now began to drift from right to left and then left to right, very slowly. It also began to rise slowly in the sky. It went behind some tall trees,  ((NUFORC Note:  Source is anonymous.  If the object was in the eastern sky, the sighting is consistent with a view of Venus.  It is very prominent in the eastern sky, and it would appear to rise off the horizon, and move generally from left to right.  PD));50.4498398706898;-104.612845689656
red and white strobing light moving oddly, not a jet, looked far off.;2001-10-18 00:00:00;2 min;red and white strobing light moving oddly, not a jet, looked far off. I was watching out my bedroom window, facing east when I saw a stobing red and white light. it appeared to jump around but maintained a fairly steady path fron WSW to NEE, I began to watch with binoculars, I could not make out a shape, it slowed and it moved to where I could not see it. What was most interesting as I was watching it through binoculars a jet flew right through my sight line abd appeared to be much larger and closer to me. Was it a sattalite or some other object. I would like to know! ((NUFORC Note:  It is not clear to us whether the sighting occurred on the morning or 18OC01, or at midnight on the night of 18OC01.  We will attempt to confirm the date and time.  PD));50.4498398706898;-104.612845689656

I was travelling down a residential street with my boyfriend, who was driving, and nephew, who was in the back seat of the vehicle.  We were passing the field of an elementary school, when I suddenly noticed a large, bright, white light shoot from directly overhead and across the sky before disappearing.  It was much bigger than a shooting star, and much brighter.  I told my boyfriend to stop the car because I thought it was an airplane going down, but it disappeared before anyone else saw it.;50.4498398706898;-104.612845689656
HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Approx 30 or so lights or so all in triangular patterns;2003-09-12 20:45:00;15 seconds;Well my best guess would be approx 30 or so lights or so all in triangular patterns  with the exception of 4 or 6 of them which were moving at high speed by themselves, a couple of them looking like they were trying to catch up to the triangles. They were all moving north west across the sky. This was the most patterns I had ever seen at one time. In the last month both myself and my wife had seen 4 other triangular patterns always moving in the same direction, but only 1 at a time. What we saw tonight was phenomenal, and is why I am writing in. I have been watching the sky's for as long as I can remember, and before this past couple of months had only ever seen singular lights moving in the sky. I have to say this has kind of freaked me out a bit. Such an large amount, and the patterns were all so perfectly formed, with the lights never breaking formation, with the exception of the ones moving individually. I have seen many unexplained lights in the night sky but this is the most incredible. I will be trying to get some video footage from now on with no guarantees, as sometimes these lights are hard to spot with the naked eye. I hope I'm not the only one seeing these lights in Saskatchewan.  The past couple of months have been just incredible for sightings.  Thank you to the witness for the report. Also more information will be updated.  Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.

Intense white, bright object in sky over Regina SK, CAN. Turned right, moved off fading away;2008-07-29 21:45:00;5-10 seconds;Intense white, bright object in sky over Regina SK, CAN. Turned right, moved off fading away Last night I went for a walk between 9pm and 10pm local time.  I walked south from my home two blocks to a local park.  There was next to no daylight left at this time, just a dusky orange in the west horizon.  Just before entering the park, I observed two jets high overhead, I always have a look at jets when I hear them just because they interest me.  This night I also observed Venus, low in the southeast sky, maybe 10 to 20 degrees from the horizon.  The sky was completely cloudless and there was no wind, a perfect night. About twenty to thirty yards after I strolled into the park I looked to the south sky about 40 degrees up and I saw a very bright, white light.  I would say its size was 3 to 4 times the size of Venus (of which I could compare as it was in the sky that night also).   The light reminded me of magnesium burning, that king of intensity, but not so much that it would hurt your eyes.  It appeared to me to move in my general direction (northwards) with a slight turning motion, again very bright and very white.  This lasted for maybe 5 seconds before it looks that it turned sharply westward, once it did that its light lost all intensity and appeared then to be a very faint white light.   It was not long (again maybe 5 seconds) before I could not see it at all.  Its motion throughout this observation struck me as craft like.   I have observed stars, planets, aircraft, meteors and comets in the skies before.  This object was truly unique. On a side note, my brother is camping at a nearby lake (40-50 miles away).  He called me this morning to inform me that he saw a UFO last night, and I had to answer back that I had as well.  The funny thing is that in our brief conversation his description of the object was very similar to mine and he saw it about 2 hours later.;50.4498398706898;-104.612845689656

Strange bright lights moving fast back and forth in East Regina (Douglas Park area);2015-06-10 00:10:00;45 minutes;Strange bright lights moving fast back and forth in East Regina (Douglas Park area) In east Regina (East Douglas Park, and Wascana area) seen in the sky 3 bright white lights moving fast in the night sky back in and forth, remaining stationary for large amount of time, then zipping back and forth again.  This occurred for almost an hour.   This was definitely not an aircraft or plane that is around today.  No aircraft can move as fast as these lights did.   Unfortunately, I do not had a camera or phone to take a photo of these lights.;50.4498398706898;-104.612845689656

Seemed close as they went through the clouds.  I was close to a lake and the ducks started making aggressive noises and flapping wings.  I felt scared and frozen, couldn't run..   Not sure why am writing this but I don't know what to do..  Saw the same like with a friend in the city month ago..  I really don't know what to do.  Told my office colleague today.

Lights circling in the sky.;2019-05-06 22:45:00;3-4 minutes;Lights circling in the sky. Sitting in our vehicle my girlfriend and I noticed a white light in the sky that seemed to be moving in patterns.  At first we both assumed it was a light coming from the ground pointing upwards into the sky, this was until I noticed a second light that looked to be following the first light around the sky above us.  The second light only stuck around for a few short moments (maybe 10-15 seconds). We posted videos we took of the incident to our snapchat story and immedietley got reactions from friends saying they had either witnessed it themselves, or knew of someone else who witnessed it from the Candy Cane park area, which is about three blocks from where we are sitting.;50.4498398706898;-104.612845689656
Two seperate lights moving towards each other, stopped and made a full rotation around each other then proceeded in opposite directions;2019-07-25 00:15:00;20 seconds;Two seperate lights moving towards each other, stopped and made a full rotation around each other then proceeded in opposite directions Two lights in the sky just to the east of Regina, SK, Canada.  Just after midnight (CST), I saw two lights in the sky roughly 45 degrees up and to the east traveling towards each other (on an east/west track).  Once they came to a close proximity, the lights rotated in a full 360 degree maneuver to form vertical circle, equal distance apart, then traveled off in opposite directions (again on an east/west track).   These were not regular aircraft lights as they were not flashing, red or green, they were a white lights.  We have large commercial jets flying over Regina on a daily basis, I have never seen that occur.  As this entire event took place in under 30 seconds. Sky was clear, other stars visible in the night sky.;50.4498398706898;-104.612845689656
>45-50 plus lights seen in Regina sky some in formation the rest in what seemed like a planned flight plan!  ((STARlink satellites??;2020-03-30 20:00:00;40 minutes;45 - 50 plus lights seen in regina sky some in formation the rest  in what seemed like a planned flight plan of ships across the sky! We counted 45 - 50 lights coming from the west towards northeast flying overhead one after another sometimes 4 or 5 in a row seemed to be in a straight line to start then three lights in triangle formation in and out of sight like they went up got dime then came back down and got bright they were closer to the moon and between the moon and the north star.  They just kept coming non stop.  Then a bright light came with three other smaller light and seemed to fly in circles in sky for two minutes.  Then flew over our heads and disappeared northeast.  We have never seen anything like this before it was amazing.  They were flying right over our heads.  We called our son in the northwest end of the city and they ran outside and saw them as well.  They had a better look at them because fewer street lights.  It was amazing!  a string of lights flying fast and high. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Adding to my report from regina saskatchewan earlier tonight. What we saw was not skylink the lights were way farther apart and then the skylink lights. And some did not fly in straight line and close together like pics i see online of skylink. I have found nothing online for pucs that would explain what we all saw.
