25 to 30 golden balls in sky or shine to them all in a verticle line.  ((Starlink satellites));2020-04-18 21:30:00;45 minutes;25 to 30 golden balls in sky or shine to them all in a verticle line WAS walking to store in Regina’s.  I noticed in sky circle type balls they were gold in night sky.  They were in a vertical line, they were a part and went one by one east in the sky from the north store coming from the North.  The objects then went far apart and went in the sky.  I count about 25 to 30 of these.  They were not as far up as a starlight that passed by in the sky closer and don’t know what they where.;50.4498398706898;-104.612845689656
