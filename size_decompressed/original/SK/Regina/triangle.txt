I looked up to the East sky and first noticed a light which was moving from south to north.  It looked like a star but it was moving straight and then became very irraticate.  It then disappeared so I looked away and looked again to the East when I saw something very large moving very slowly.  It was totally black and was the shape of a triangle. It had three lights on each side at the wide side of the V.  It was a solid object and there was absolutely no noise at all.  It was going about five miles a hour and was only about thirty to forty feet high.  I tried getting an approximate height by comparing it to our house and the neighbours house.  It came right over our adjoining driveways.  I could see it was black because the street light and our light on the side of our house gave enough light just to reflect light off the UFO.  We have a park behind us but I was too afraid to go to our backyard to see where it went.  When my cab came I told him about it and we both looked for it but it was gone.  I would estimate it to be between 60 - 70  feet across and about 40 - 50 feet long.  I could have hit it with a rock - also the lights were not lit up but were sort of florescent. This was a truly amazing UFO and I am very glad that I can finally share it with other people that have had a similar experience.;50.4498398706898;-104.612845689656
approx 30 or so lights or so all in trianguler patterns  with the exeption of 4 or 6 which were moving at high speed by themselves;2003-09-12 20:45:00;10 min;approx 30 or so lights or so all in trianguler patterns  with the exeption of 4 or 6 which were moving at high speed by themselves Well my best guess would be approx 30 or so lights or so all in trianguler patterns  with the exeption of 4 or 6 of them which were moving at high speed by themselves, a couple of them looking like they were trying to catch up to the triangles. They were all moveing north west accross the sky. This was the most patterns i had ever seen at one time. in the last month both myself and my wife had seen 4 other trianguler patterns always moving in the same direction, but only 1 at a time. What we saw tonight was phenominal, and is why i am writting in. I have been watching the skys for as long as I can remember, and before this past couple of months had only ever seen singuler lights moving in the sky. I have to say this has kind of freaked me out a bit. Such an large amount, and the patterns were all so perfectly formed, with the lights never breaking formation, with the exception of the ones moving individually. I have seen many unexplained lights in the night sky but this is the most incredible. I will be trying to get some video footage from now on with no gaurentees, as sometimes theese lights are hard to spot with the naked eye. I hope im not the only one seeing these lights in Saskatchewan. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));50.4498398706898;-104.612845689656

At approximately midnight we all saw three lights moving very fast in the sky why seemed like no more than 1000 feet above us.  It was in our range of sight for maybe ten seconds, no more and disappeared to the north.  It came from the south.  I Have never seen anything like this.;50.4498398706898;-104.612845689656
Black soft triangular shaped ufo, three white lights near each tip seen slowly moving in general southward heading over Regina Sk, Can.;2013-05-05 00:43:00;4 minutes;black soft triangular shaped ufo, three white lights near each tip seen slowly moving in general southward heading over Regina Sk, Can.  Given it was so late at night, I can only estimate it appeared to be at a fairly low altitude of approximately 2000-3000ft.   We were able to watch it gently almost glide across the clear night sky at an angel of 70 degrees from where we were standing until it proceeded beyond our line of sight given trees in the area and buildings.   The craft gave of absolutley no noise that could heard... or at least less then the noise of crickets, and general hum of the small city night life.  This is  first experience with a flying aircraft that I personally have not been able to logially explain to some degree.  I have always been fascinated with aircraft ever since i was a young boy, and even joined local air cadets as a teen, the drive for flight and knowledge was so great.  So for me to see something so aerodynamically unsteady flying s! o smoothly at such a low speed, has me flabergasted(blown away with disbelief).  Unfortunaly we are parents of young children and had no possibility or chance to follow it as our children were sound asleep inside our house no more then five feet from where we were watching the event unfold.;50.4498398706898;-104.612845689656
Mirrored triangular shaped object March 19, 2014.;2014-03-19 07:40:00;15 seconds;Mirrored triangular shaped object, March 19, 2014 Saw a shiny triangle shaped object in the sky - looked like a piece of mirror.  There were no jetstreams. It was still for about 5 seconds and then started moving slowly at first and then moved very fast & I watched it decrease in size rapidly. It was in the southeast part of the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect an evening sighting, but cannot be certain.  The source of the report has not responded to our e-mail.
