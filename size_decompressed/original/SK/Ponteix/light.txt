Extremely high speed vanishing bright light;2012-08-08 22:00:00;1-2 minutes;Extremely high speed vanishing bright light We saw a very bright round light travelling at very high speed across the sky,   After watching for a while it got dim and then vanished.   A few minutes later we saw another light that was much higher in the sky travelling in the same fashion.  I believe that the object flew out of our atmosphere;49.7526;-107.4837
