Black, Triangular UFO sighted along grid road in Central Saskatchewan.;2004-04-20 01:30:00;Approx. 5 minutes;Black, Triangular UFO sighted along grid road in Central Saskatchewan. My step son and wife were driving down the grid road 9 km east of Yorkton when we saw what looked like an oddly shaped fighter jet coming at us fairly low to the road. We yielded basically in stunned fashion when the object seemed so slow almost to a halt 20 feet in front of our Suburban. It was plain as day...the object was a black triangle with no apparent windows and on the bottom was one large light in each of the three corners. It rotated so a different angle was facing foward and took off in a blur overtop our car. It was as if the object went straight up once it came to view in our backwindow and vanished into the sky.
