Family witness large bright yellowish/orange sphere shaped light in northern sky.;2014-07-01 22:50:00;5 minutes;family witness large bright yellowish/orange sphere shaped light in northern sky we witnessed a large bright sphere shaped light (orange-yellow)  object in the northern sky, just sitting in one place, the light was extremely bright.. then it moved fairly quickly westwardly upward in the sky, the light remained bright and then the light just seemed to fade out/disappear while it got smaller almost seemed like a pin prick.  It was very odd, not like any airplane.  We don't live near an airport, this is a small town.;52.2039;-105.1159
