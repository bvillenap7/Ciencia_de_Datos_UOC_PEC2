Hovering over a mountain outside between Chugwater, WY, and Wheatland, WY.  To the west of I25. The object was hexagonal, hovered at a 45*angle with a black mist type looking trail (that never fell, never got bigger or smaller) that extended out about 1 and 1/2 times the length of the body of the object. It was stationary against a calm blue sky with minimal clouds. Sunset.  We watched it approx. 7 mins.  We saw it through binoculars, and with the naked eye.  I looked away to help a child, and looked back it was gone.  No sound  No lights  Nothing.  Like it vanished;41.7514;-104.8181
