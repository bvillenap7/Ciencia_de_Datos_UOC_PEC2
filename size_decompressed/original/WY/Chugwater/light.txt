F.E. Warren AFB Wyoming sightings;2001-10-15 03:00:00;30 seconds;F.E. Warren AFB Wyoming sightings I was serving at F.E. Warren AFB in Wyoming, I was on duty in the Missile Field doing the night shift. I was actually at Romeo site which is an installation of F.E. Warren AFB. I went outside to smoke a cigarette and saw a extremely bright light in the sky. It wasn't huge, It looked about the size of a plane you'd see in the air. The light moved around for about 20 seconds then all of the sudden it flew away very fast, leaving a white bright tail behind it. I thought I was going nuts or was just possably sleep deprived, but when I told another flight mate of mine, he told me that himself as well as many others had seen the exact same thing over the skies of Wyoming late at night on numerous occasions. I had only seen it once but it I know for a fact that it wasnt a plane and it wasnt a blimp and no shooting stars moves around slowly for approximately 20 seconds and then just shoots off.
