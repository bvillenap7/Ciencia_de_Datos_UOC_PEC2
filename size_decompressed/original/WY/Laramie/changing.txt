Cloud-like object at extreme range changes shape.;1993-08-23 19:56:00;9 minutes;Cloud-like object at extreme range changes shape. This account is taken from a personal report made shortly after the sighting:  I was driving westbound on Interstate 80 between Cheyenne and Laramie, Wyoming when I spied what I at first thought to be a tiny cloud in an otherwise cloudless sky.  Very soon after sighting it, we passed from Laramie County (containing Cheyenne) into Albany County (containing Laramie).  The heavens were still bright (sunset had been at 19:39).  The only other object in the sky was the first-quarter Moon.  The cloud had an almost vertical orientation at first, and apparently hung over the Vedauwoo area (a formation of exposed granite mountains east of Laramie).  After a minute or so, the cloud took on more of a spherical shape but later did resume its near-vertical attitude for a short while.  As I drove toward the very bright object at 65 mph, it only seemed to get further away, more starlike, and closer to the horizon, until I lost it at about 20:05, some nine minutes after first noticing it.  The most likely explanation for this sighting is a high-altitude westbound aircraft reflecting the rays of the Sun and emitting a short contrail.  But it might have been something less conventional.  It certainly impressed me enough at the time to record the details, even though I am a licensed pilot.;41.4280975155279;-105.642019254658
A cluster of approximately 15 lights appeared and fanned out into a V shape while appearing to fly overhead.;2002-04-04 19:45:00;30 seconds;A cluster of approximately 15 lights appeared and fanned out into a V shape while appearing to fly overhead. This is the third time I have seen the same thing.  Two years ago, within about a two week span, I saw a similar thing and thought it was weird and did not report it.  Tonight I saw what appeared to be approximately 15 lights in a clustered shape in the sky, not far enough away to be stars but about as far as a aircraft might fly.  The cluster changed shape as I looked toward it, and fanned out into a V shape.  It continued to fly straight ahead and I looked away.;41.4280975155279;-105.642019254658
Large Orange UFO over Laramie, WY.;2011-12-15 17:30:00;15 minutes aprox;Large Orange UFO over Laramie, WY. I sighted a large orange ball of light on the North end of town.  It was hovering at about tree height.  I stepped out toward the field next to my house to get a better look.   After a moment the light flashed brightly and expanded into long horizontal cylinder shaped light, with the center still a glowing orange ball.   This object was quite large.   It began moving steadily in my direction when I moved inside out of fear.  I came back outside after about ten minutes and did not see it.   After scanning the sky I noticed a similar orange ball, except it was way up in the sky and appeared to be far away, hovering above town.;41.4280975155279;-105.642019254658
