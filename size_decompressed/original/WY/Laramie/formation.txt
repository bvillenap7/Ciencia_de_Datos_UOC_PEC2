Formation of Tremonton-like daylight disks in Wyoming;1993-05-10 13:00:00;one minute;Formation of Tremonton-like daylight disks in Wyoming Shortly after sighting what looked exactly like the Tremonton, Utah objects filmed in July 1952 by Delbert C. Newhouse, I recorded the following.  I had just moved from Montana back to Wyoming a few days previously.  As I was driving north on US highway 287 just north of the Colorado-Wyoming stateline, I spotted about 10 bright objects flying in loose formation at several thousand feet altitude above ground level.  I immediately stopped my pickup truck to get a better look, but they were gone.  If they were birds, then they flew away pretty quickly, because I could not locate the objects with binoculars.;41.4280975155279;-105.642019254658

My husband and I were outside with our dog. I looked into the Eastern sky and saw a bunch of uniform lights in a line moving across the sky. I yelled at my husband to look and he said there were 7 lights. They were moving in a uniform fashion toward the north east. There was an equal amount of space between the lights. The lights were pointed east/northeast and moving to the northeast. A very large formation of lights. They were not bright, but equal to the stars in the sky around them. It continued to move slowly across the sky out of sight. It only took a minute, but it was not fast. It was difficult to tell how far up they were.;41.4280975155279;-105.642019254658
