Colorado Springs, Colorado, Thursday, February 04, 2016,....  In reference to this report, I remembered an red fog that occurs Laramie, WY.  I was attending pharmacy school when  this happen.   The dark sky turned slowly into a very dark red fog and stayed like that for 2 hours. as a scientist I never understood this phenomenon.   I did get to meet with ((name deleted)) for 3 hours.  I saw a ufo that night after visiting ((same name deleted)).   Thank you for your work.;41.4280975155279;-105.642019254658
Artificial pulsating sound heard, no craft seen.;1993-06-17 15:00:00;unknown;Artificial pulsating sound heard, no craft seen. The following report came from two friends of mine, George and Bob (pseudonyms).  We were outside building a deck in the rain, not making any noise ourselves except for, occasionally, hammering.  There was heavy, complete dark cloud cover.  We heard a whirring kind of noise.  George: I thought it sounded like air blowing through some kind of metal tube.  Bob: I thought it sounded like highly crafted ball bearings rolling, pulsating.  Then it grew louder, we came out to the front of the yard to listen, and then it faded away pretty quickly.;41.4280975155279;-105.642019254658
Line of 10-12 lights moving in unusual linear, then angled pattern;2020-12-03 19:00:00;3 minutes;Line of 10-12 lights moving in unusual linear, then angled pattern Star-light bright small shapes traveling at about small airplane speed north aligned in a more or less east-west string moving just above the mountain tops (and behind the trees in my back yard)to the west of Laramie.  The objects proceeded northward at a slight angle (so you could see multiples in a line) spanning the width of my hand at arms length. The line of objects appeared to turn slightly to the west with the pivot point at the far end.Once the objects lined up on the eastern end object, they faded completely away.  I saw a similar light show in the back country of Colorado about 15 years ago in the South Platte Valley, except it was a v-shaped alignment of similar star-bright objects.;41.4280975155279;-105.642019254658
