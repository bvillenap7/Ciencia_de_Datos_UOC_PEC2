Odd intelligent seeming lights seen during a UFO conference in Laramie, WY.;1992-06-24 22:00:00;2 odd lights;Odd intelligent seeming lights seen during a UFO conference in Laramie, WY. Prior to attending good friend Leo Sprinkle's UFO conference in 1992 Laramie,WY when he still held them there,both I and a friend had premonitions that we'd see a UFO while in attendance.She put an importance on 11 o'clock. I at spotting one at the 10 o'clock sky position through the right-side passanger window.I add this as enhanced ESP during UFO activity is often experienced,as well.  Leo suggested we visit a nearby ranch if we wished,for odd sky events had often been seen there many times,so we went. Knowing that ETs for some reason found punnish humor funny, I noted with interest that we spotted an erratic star at 10 PM at the 11 o'clock position in the sky,not out of the right-side window,but the left. Then from lower left in the sky a softly glowing orb was seen moving toward the erratic star in a jerky stop and go way. It made a 90 degree turn and merged with the other. A bit later it came out again, moving from our left to right until it stopped directly in front of us at an 11 o'clock sky position as seen through the windshield It made another 90 degree turn and hovered directly above us over the open moon roof for about a minute or so,then continued on in a straight line till out of sight. Was not a satellite that moves in an arc, nor jerkily unless inebriated.  The whole event took about 10 to 15 minutes,after which,I looked for the Mars/Venus/Jupiter alignment scheduled that night so not to be accussed of mistaking it for a UFO. It was over our right shoulders to the rear. Opposite to where the sighting had taken place.  It was probably what one would call a minor sighting today, but I heard you say you'd be interested in older reports when on with Noory last. Both my friend and I had earlier sightings. Leo has the above one on file, along with others.  Thank you.;41.4280975155279;-105.642019254658
Light seen, Laramie, WY looking North;2001-02-07 10:00:00;?;Light seen, Laramie, WY looking North Reading the 8/24/01 Casper Star Tribune Strange Light seen near Rock River, I remembered I took a photo of the light back in February, for my Photo of the Day collection.  That is all that I know, I was at 1301 Grafton in the backyard looking North (Rock River is North of Laramie) I saw this light and took a few pictures of it with my digital camera. Remember it was a cold night, and 'm positive I don't know what I took a picture of, just a light of some sort. I'm pretty sure I have more photos of it and am giving you a link to my photo albums look in Photo of the day Feb 7, 2001. http://www.((URL deleted)) Please contact me if you would like to see the other photos ((name deleted));41.4280975155279;-105.642019254658
Three pinpoints of light flying in unison, then making extremely fast erratic movements, before flying in unison again.;2001-04-25 22:00:00;8 seconds;Three pinpoints of light flying in unison, then making extremely fast erratic movements, before flying in unison again. three rather dim pinpoints of light the size of distant stars or satellites were moving across the sky in my direction in unison.  they seemed very far away (maybe higher than a commercial jet flies).  As they approached the point of being directly overhead, they began to dart in different directions, like fire-flies buzzing around each other while at the same time, maintaining their general course (west, south-west to east, north/east.  The amount of distance they were covering in such short time with each swerve and the erratic changes in directions struck me as impossible for any aircraft I know.  They were too small, too far away and flying in too coordinated a manner to be insects or birds (and the quality of light looked exactly like a star).  The objects seemed to accelerate in the general direction they had been traveling to begin with, as if they were again flying in a more unison and coordinated fashion.  At this point they flew over the roof of my house and I was unable to find them afterward.;41.4280975155279;-105.642019254658
I saw a white light flash out of my drivers window at about 35 degrees to my left in the night sky, like a beam of light.;2005-11-05 23:28:00;1-2 seconds;I saw a white light flash out of my drivers window at about 35 degrees to my left in the night sky, like a beam of light. I was just traveling between Fort Collins, Colorado and Laramie, Wyoming on US highway 287 and I saw a white light flash out of my drivers window at about 35 degrees in the night sky.  It was a quick flash and that was it.  It did seem to be a beem of light.  After the flash I looked in that direction but I did not see anything else unusual.  I was driving my truck and was the only one in the vehicle. There was on car that passed me as this happened and there was another vehicle behind me probably 1-1/2 to 2 miles.   I was in Wyoming when this happened.;41.4280975155279;-105.642019254658
Light spotted in the plains.;2015-06-19 22:00:00;2 hours;Light spotted in the plains. Strange light seen over Roger's Caynon in WY @22:00.  Two witnesses.   Assumed to be a plane but did not move over the course of two hours.   Been stargazing since a child, knowing differences in types of stars, planes, satellites, and ISS and how they're seen in the night sky.  Was not any of the list possibilities.   Slightly larger than a planet and glowed brighter than Venus on a new moon. White light with a slight haze around it.   No sound and oddly no animals sounds throughout the night.  NO coyotes, birds, or prairie dogs.   Once strange light suddenly disappeared near 0:00, animal sounds could be heard again. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));41.4280975155279;-105.642019254658
