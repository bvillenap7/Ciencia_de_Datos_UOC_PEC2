Bright white light.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probable sighting of ISS, which passed to the north of Laramie at 22:15 hrs..  PD));2009-07-21 22:15:00;45 seconds;Bright white light As I my mother and I returned from the store my mother brought to my attention to an object in the sky to the north of us.  The object was a very large white light no strobes or flashing of any kind.  The object as my mother said, Just appeared.   The object traveled on a south easterly path towards us.  As the object got close it also got larger.  There was absolutely no nose with this object.   The object then changed directions and began traveling east.  The object traveled in that direction for about fifteen seconds, before turning blue for a split second and diapering.  I know that we did not lose the object behind clouds because we could still see stars in the sky were the object was last seen.  I believe this to be a UFO, as I have never seen an aircraft of any kind move at this speed, maneuver the way this craft did.

Laramie, small circular craft;2012-06-20 16:00:00;5 minutes;Laramie, small circular craft The first sighting of this object was a week prior to the 6/20 event, during a thunder storm. The circle object (we thought to be a high altitude bird we thought was riding the wind) was silently stationary at a high altitude. Every once and a while it would move away from it's location, then return. The objects size was was that of an un-popped popcorn kernel held at arms length. A co-worker and I were curious as to what type of bird it was, so he went to get binoculars. As he returned with the binoculars the craft, definitely not bird took off at a high speed heading west, into the storm.  The second sighting, 6/20, took place at the same location as I as walking to my car for my lunch break. I thought I saw an object move, east to west, at a very high speed. As I focused in and found the object in the eastern sky it was the same size, and shape craft moving silently, no con-trails, towards my and co-workers location. I asked my co-worker &quotremember that thing that was in the storm the other day?&quot and he responded with &quotyeah, that white thing up there?&quot. I could not tell if the object was white, or was reflective, but I couldnt seem to focus on it completely. As we watched the object as it went stationary and I told him to go inside and grab the binoculars. As he went the object once again silently started heading east at a slow speed. I tracked the object for about 2-3 minutes as it got smaller and smaller. I took my eyes off it for a brief moment and it disappeared completely. At the rate of speed it was moving it would not have had enough! time to get completely out of eye sight and was no where near the horizon when I lost it. We panned the skies with the binoculars for a few minutes to no avail.  I will continue to update on this craft as it seems to have an interest in that location, although it is no place special at all.;41.4280975155279;-105.642019254658
