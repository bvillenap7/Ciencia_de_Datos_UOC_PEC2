2 unusual flashes of light;2008-12-21 17:00:00;1-2 seconds;2 unusual flashes of light While driving on the old road from Laramie, WY to Wamsutter, WY, I saw a flash of light that was not related to a car, airplane, light tower, etc.  It was like a hologram.   The first one was a neon blue and bright pink with a horizontal pattern-the way blinds on a window are and it was as if it buzzed into view and then quickly went away.   A short distance later another light flashed but not as large and it was a bright bluish white.  My husband said he saw the same thing as a small boy on the same road but did not ever tell anyone until he saw the way I reacted after seeing the light.  I've never ever seen anything like these lights.   I would not have submitted a report but I noticed that someone saw something very similar to what I witnessed a while back so I know I'm not crazy and it makes me feel like I saw something that was unusual.;41.4280975155279;-105.642019254658
