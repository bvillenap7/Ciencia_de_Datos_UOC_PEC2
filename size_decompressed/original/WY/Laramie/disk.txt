Witness is lured out of house, silent craft glides overhead, more body marks are discovered.;1989-01-19 20:15:00;10 minutes;Witness is lured out of house, silent craft glides overhead, more body marks are discovered. This is the third incident in a cluster of personal reports in January 1989, the details of which were written down just after the sightings.  Two days and 15 minutes after seeing a silent craft fly over my house, I was at home sitting on the sofa in front of my pot-bellied wood-burning stove, which had a cozy fire burning inside.  I fed a piece of paper to the woodstove, which was immediately sucked up the stovepipe instead of burning.  Going outside to see if I could see the paper come out the chimney, I noticed a prominent off-white object with an orange tint aproaching from the southeast.  I went back inside to get my binoculars, and when I returned outside, the craft was gliding in complete silence over the house at about 1200 feet altitude and estimated speed of 85 mph.  It had a whitish or orange-white dome-light on top and red and green running lights below and to the sides, giving the craft a saucer-like appearance and also in compliance with standard aircraft lighting configurations.  The green nav-light was on its right and the red nav-light was on its left, the same as for airplanes.  The next morning, after taking a shower, I discovered more bleeding marks on my body.  There was one more mark on my right ear, three marks (scoops and tiny holes) on my left ear, and a large (1/8 x 1/4) scoop wound on my back.  I was 27 years old at the time, trained in basic astronomy in college, and familiar with aircraft as a private pilot with nearly six years experience.  There was no missing time involved, and no strange memories have ever emerged. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although witness does not indicate that fact.  One of three seemingly credible reports from same source.  Please see report for Ft. Collins, WY, 01/07/89, and Laramie, WY, 01/17/89.  PD));41.4280975155279;-105.642019254658
