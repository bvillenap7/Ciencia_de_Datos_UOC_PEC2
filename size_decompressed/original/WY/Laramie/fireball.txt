Fireball ascends straight up in air, and comes right back down in same location.;2001-08-17 22:30:00;25 SECONDS;Fireball ascends straight up in air, and comes right back down in same location. At a little after 22:30 Hrs., I was operating a ((company deleted)) freight train in a southernly direction just north of Laramie, Wyoming. Just after passing the eastbound scanner and block signal at mile post 576 (10 miles north of Laramie), I looked out of the front window of the engine just to my right, and saw an orange fireball go straight up in the air, just beyond a rise in the terrain, and come right back down again. I said to my colleague, Did you see that! But he was reading, and didn't notice it. The object from where I was, looked like a baseball that had been soaked in gasoline, and set on fire. It resemebled the sun on a bright day, but with flames all around it. I would say from where I saw it, it was the size of an old school kickball. (I initially thought it was kids, but the area there is sparsely populated.) Upon proceeding with the train through the cut in the rise, about 3/4 of a mile further on, I looked back to the Northwest. I noticed what looked like a very bright, orange ball on the ground.  This would have been the correct location from where it had gone up in the air , and came back down again.  There are no houses or other structures there, just open field. I looked several more times, and the object at that time looked like a bright campfire, about the size of a baseball, as at this point, I was about 2 to 3 miles from it, and moving away. Since I saw this, I have looked over there to see if there could be a Ranch house or other structure, but there is just open range.
