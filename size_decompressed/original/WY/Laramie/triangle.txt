Looked exactly like a slow rotating fidget spinner, it had green yellow lights and the rings were not fully lit, just the outline of the circles.  Spotted on the horizon and it came straight over us very quickly, I would estimate the height between 5000-7000 feet,  And even at that distance it was still fairly large in the sky.  No noise.  Dead silent.  Faster than anything ive ever seen.  My girlfriend saw it with my start to finish.  It disappeared super fast like it was accelerating and by the time it was overhead it was going nearly too fast to see.  Came from due southand was northbound directly over Laramie.;41.4280975155279;-105.642019254658
