Silent lighted craft flies over house, witness later discovers body marks.;1989-01-17 20:00:00;15 minutes;Silent lighted craft flies over house, witness later discovers body marks. Ten days after seeing a brilliant white light change luminosity and mimic the planet Mercury in northern Colorado, I saw a second craft.  I was driving home, southbound on US287 in Laramie, Wyoming, when I spotted an approaching flying object to the southeast.  It was white with an orange tint and was still approaching when I reached home three miles south of town.  I viewed the UFO through binoculars as it flew silently over the house at an estimated 1200 feet altitude and estimated speed of 100 mph.  It appeared oblong in shape, but all I could really see were four or five bright lights of various colors, including a white strobe and dimmer red and green lights.  The next morning I discovered a bleeding puncture wound on my right ear after showering.  This report should be studied together with another sighting which took place two days later, in order to appreciate the emerging pattern. At the time of this event, I was 27 years old, a private pilot and college student. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although witness does not indicate that fact.

Small dark speck paces airliner, seen from ground.;1989-07-01 14:00:00;30 seconds;Small dark speck paces airliner, seen from ground. One day in about the year 1989, I was helping a friend move a piano across town in his moving truck.  We were stopped at a red light, when I noticed an airliner flying far overhead.  I mentioned it to my friend, so he glanced up and said he could see a little dot next to it.  So I looked back, and sure enough, there it was:  a small dark speck perfectly pacing the jet.  It appeared to be behind and maybe a little below the plane, and was so small as to be virtually unnoticeable.  I had to look twice myself before I saw it.  I doubt anyone in the plane saw the object, based on its observed location relative to the plane.  I had read stories of UFOs pacing trains, planes, and ships, but from this time onward I had first-hand knowledge of this part of the pattern. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Blood-red cloud splits in two and rains onto ground.;2001-07-01 11:50:00;5 minutes;Blood-red cloud splits in two and rains onto ground. My wife, my wife's nephew, and I were driving southbound on US287 some 10 miles north of Laramie, Wyoming at about noon in the summer of 2001, when we all noticed a blood-red cloud to our southeast, over the Laramie Range.  This wasn't the sort of red cloud seen at sunrise or sunset.  The time was about noon, and the cloud was cumulus type and small.  As we watched, the cloud gradually split into two clouds, each of which then appeared to emit red virga to the ground.  In a few minutes both clouds had rained themselves onto the ground east of Laramie and had completely disappeared.  The three of us all agreed on what we had seen.

large craft white streak in sky at18:30  about 20miles South of Laramie with rotating lights underneath;2007-09-30 18:30:00;25 minutes;large craft white streak in sky at18:30  about 20miles South of Laramie with rotating lights underneath On Sunday  September 30th, at about 6:30 PM, about 20 miles south of Laramie, Wyoming, while driving north on highway 287, my wife spotted what, at first, looked  like a white cloud or contrail in the west high above the Snowy Range mountains.  I was driving and listening to the radio. It was a cloudless sky, so the white streak stood out.   After watching about five minutes she alerted me that it was a craft.  She saw revolving lights under the object.  The lights also changed color to blue and then red, then back to white. I looked and saw it  and pulled off the road to get a good look.  The object was not moving.  We had the mountain range to use as a marker. As we continued to drive toward Laramie we could see the object did not move.  It was about two inches wide at arms length and we estimate it to be 30-40 miles west of us. It was about a fist above the mountains.  We continued to watch until we reached Laramie about twenty to twenty-five minutes after we first spotted it.   There was no mistaking it with anything we know.   We are both experienced sky-watchers and this was the real deal.;41.4280975155279;-105.642019254658
