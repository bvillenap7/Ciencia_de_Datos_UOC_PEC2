Bright orange sphere sitting in same spot for long time.;2013-12-07 01:00:00;30 minutes;Bright orange sphere sitting in same spot for long time. As I was heading out to the downtown area of Laramie, Wyoming, I saw an orange light from far away and thought it was a street lamp.  As my friend drove closer, I saw it in the same spot. It was an orange sphere shape and sat there for at least 20-30 minutes till we went inside somewhere.  When I came out it was gone.  It was not a street lamp after looking more closely as it was higher in the sky.  It was not the moon or a plane and was bright orange and a large bright light.  I was able to take a picture and after showing other people, they agree, they do not know what it is and say its not a street lamp or the moon.;41.4280975155279;-105.642019254658
