Multiple white soaring lights in one section of sky.;2010-06-06 02:45:00;3:15;Multiple white soaring lights in one section of sky. Location specifics: There were scattered clouds, little to no city lights.  Our view was not obscured by trees or buildings. While looking at the sky to the left of the moon, we saw round balls of light that were far bigger than a star flying around in non specific patterns.  Lights were seen every few seconds with each lasting between 3-10 seconds per light. The lights appeared to not originate from any one location but was kept within a specific section of the overall sky. The flying lights were bright white but appeared to either fade or go behind clouds.  The size was much larger than shooting stars or satellites.  At times there were as many as 6 of these lights going in different directions at one time.  The lights had no specific pattern and appeard to be 'soaring' and would change direction. There was no apparent trail left by the lights.  No other color than white to the lights, no sound, no aircraft in the area or apparent satellites near by. This activity seemed to be specific to an area close to where we saw the moon, as opposed to all throughout the sky.  We called a friend to go outside and look but city lights in their area (about a mile north of our location)prevented them from seeing what we saw. This activity continued for about half an hour with random flying' lights. A visible activity stopped by 3:40.  We attempted to get video footage with our digital camera but did not get any useful images.;44.0331;-105.534748275862
Seen white ball of light falling from sky then almost landed in Foothills before it sped off going North.;2013-05-02 19:45:00;15 minutes;Seen white ball of light falling from sky then almost landed in Foothills before it sped off going North. My kids (ages 26, 8, 6, and 3) and I were driving North West when I spotted what looked like something big falling out of the sky.  I thought I was going to see an asteroid or something like that so I pulled over. It had a short thick line above it that looked like a jet streak then it stopped and the entire jet streak came together into a ball of white light.  It looked like it was going to land in the Foothills subdivision but would go back up. I followed it and it seemed close but the light was getting smaller then it bolted north and I couldn't catch up to it again.  There was only 1 light.;44.0331;-105.534748275862
