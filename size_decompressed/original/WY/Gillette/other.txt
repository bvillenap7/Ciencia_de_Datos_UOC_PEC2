We were going east on 14-16 when I saw this craft flying from the SSW to the NNEat about 2000 AGL and about 6 miles out. I saw it about 20 degrees to the right and I pointed it out to my wife and son as a UFO. My wife said it was a airplane, but there was no beacon or any lights flashing at all. as it passed about 40 to45 degrees to NNW it started to shine very brightly like the sun glaring of aluminum and starting a shallow bank back to the northwest at which time it disappeared. My wife looked at me and said it disappeared. all I could say was it sure did. I could only discribe this vehicle as one of the fighters on Battle Star Galactica.

3 UFO's;2012-09-22 02:30:00;6.5 hours;3 UFO's I got a phone call at 3:00am. I ran out to my balcony because my sister told me to look out there and tell her what I saw, at this time I woke my roommate up because I saw a HUGE light just parallel from the radio tower (the one with the red blinking lights) off of Southern Drive.  As morning came closer it was apparent that there was smaller (or farther away…very faint) dots in a circle around it, perfectly spaced apart.  This big one would move up and then back down and because of the tower you could see it moving.  Then it would just sit there for 30-45 minutes, then move a few feet.  You could see flashes of lights coming from this object, like rays shooting out.  All of a sudden further to my right (going towards Buffalo) I saw flashing white and red lights in the sky (looked like lights that would be on top of a police car). It would get brighter and then get dimmer again. When it got bright you could see disk shape to it and at random I could see green lights go in a circular movement around the bottom of it. Then I noticed a bright red/white flashing object directly above my apartment building. The two smaller ones and the big one formed a HUGE triangle in the sky. I sat there and watched this from my balcony for hours.   Around 5:30 am the smaller ones were in the sky together to my right and they looked more orange.  All of a sudden I saw the sky around one light up with a flash. (Like something you would’ve seen on Independence Day) and then it was gone. Seconds later the same things happen to the other one. The whole time the bigger one was moving so slowly back into the sky, but was still brighter than the North Star. As the sun came up and all of the stars disappeared I could still see this object. I watched this object until about 7:10 am when it finally disappeared.;44.0331;-105.534748275862
