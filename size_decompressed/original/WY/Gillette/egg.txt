Bell shaped object emiting bright light from bottom spotted near Gillette Wyoming.;2008-08-11 20:15:00;2-5 minutes;Bell shaped object emiting bright light from bottom spotted near Gillette Wyoming. While getting ready to watch a firework competition at the Cam-Plex, my wife and I noticed a bright ball of light in the sky.  The object was kinda to our backs and appeared to be at about 2,000'-3,000'AGL moving rather slow from north to south. I had a pair of binoculars so I used them to get a closer view. What I saw when viewed through the binoculars was a bell shaped object with the ball of light coming out from the bottom center. At this point I passed the binoculars to my wife who witnessed the same thing. At this point the object then took a eastward heading and began to climb at a rather rapid pace. Also note that when the object was viewed through the binoculars there were no strobe lights or any other significant aircraft markings. When the object went east it was virtually passing right above us. My wife had the binoculars at that point in time. She stated that the object then went straight up with a little side to side movement. Within a couple of seconds the object had left the atmosphere and was out of sight. My knowledge of aircraft is quite extensive as I am a student pilot, served as an aircrew member with the US Air Force and have worked as an air base firefighter. My wife is currently in school to become an R.N.;44.0331;-105.534748275862
