Neon green flying object seen over Gillette, Wyoming;2002-09-06 20:30:00;5 seconds;Neon green flying object seen over Gillette, Wyoming At first glance it seemed to be a shooting star, but it was larger than a star and was neon green and was flying horizontally.  It has a large streak behind it, because it was moving at such a high rate of speed.  My husband says it appeared to be the size of a football, but was at least 2,500 feet in the air.  It went through the clouds and you could still see the glowing green and it's streak behind it, then appeared in the clear sky and 'took off.'  My husband says it seemed to go at least 700-800 mph.;44.0331;-105.534748275862
Large White/Green Object Descends over Gillette, Wyoming,  No known Impact;2010-12-13 18:24:00;10 seconds;Large White/Green Object Descends over Gillette, Wyoming, No known Impact On December 13, approx 16:24 while traveling west bound on Clovis Point Road on the east side of Gillette near Interstate 90, a large fireball coming from the north and traveling at a low altitude descended across the sky over Gillette. The fireball appeared to be white in color, with green hued 'tails' or tracings. The ball itself appeared to be the size of a house, with the tail being 200 yards approx. It was descending at an angle, with the low side being to the south, with an excessive rate of speed in it's course. The object in question appeared to be no more than five miles before me, close enough to be viewable within clear skies.  The rate of speed and angle of the object would give assumption of impact to the ground, though none was seen. There was no sound associated with the object, and impact, if such occurred, would have been south east of Gillette, though it was blocked by a hill in the line of sight.  There was no evidence of its existence afterwards, as well as no known reporting.;44.0331;-105.534748275862
