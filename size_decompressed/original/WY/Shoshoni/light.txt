((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-17 21:00:00;10-15 minutes;Sitting outside and I observed a few small solid white lights that looked like stars but they were moving across the sky There were no other color lights and no flashing or blinking. They were moving in an evenly spaced line from the south going NE. I had my boyfriend come out to see and bring the binoculars. We watched the line go on for at least 10 minutes and there were at least 50 of them. Occasionally there would be 2 side by side or one passing another. There were no other aircraft over is at the time according to flight tracker app.;43.2457;-108.1007
