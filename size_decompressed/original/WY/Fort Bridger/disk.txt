Saw very bright green light in western sky.;2002-09-28 18:30:00;30 seconds;Saw very bright green light in western sky. Caught site of a bright green flat disk shaped light in the western sky.  It was difficult to tell if it was close or far away.  When I first saw it, it was just hovering.  It then moved slowly to the north, then quickly disappeared into the clouds.  I continued to watch to see if it came out again from the clouds, but it didn't.  Saw 2 helicopters and several large aircraft about 15 minutes after in same direction, but could not tell type of planes due to darkness. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.
