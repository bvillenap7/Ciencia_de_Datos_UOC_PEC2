My mother said that they were sitting having coffee and when she let her little dog out she noticed this oval shaped craft just hanging over the near by hills.   She called my dad to see and they say it just hung there for about 30 to 45 minutes before it finally flew off ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.
