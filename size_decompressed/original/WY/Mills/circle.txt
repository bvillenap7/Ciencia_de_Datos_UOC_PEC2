White in color and moving very fast.  Flying together.  No wings I saw 2 round white objects flying fast and near each other.   They were solid and made movements that were not natural.  They were silent, had no windows (from my viewpoint)   Had no exhaust or fumes that I could see of any kind.  They were smaller than the sun but larger than a star would be from ground-level point of view.   I REALLY think I saw something unusual here.  They moved around in a way that would indicate they were being controled and were not natural.  They moved from SW to NE in direction.  The objects were moving VERY fast.   I didnt have time to even get a camera, although the thought occured.   I hope someone else noticed so that we may verify this incident.   Thank you for your time.  I hope we can get to the bottom of this stuff sometime soon. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and we found him to be quite objective, eloquent, and credible.  We suspect his description of the sighting is quite accurate.   He stated that when he first witnessed the objects, they were almost directly overhead.  They moved to the horizon in approximately 30-40 seconds (estimate).  He added that the two objects appeared to be flying in unwavering formation, until they got close to the horizon, when they appeared to begin moving, relative to one another.  PD));42.8377;-106.368
