Large triangle.;1999-06-10 23:00:00;2 minutes;Large Triangle. A friend, and myself were laying on a trampoline looking up at the stars.  It was a silent night with only the occasional sound of traffic coming from downtown roughly 2 miles away from our location.   As we were watching the stars we both noticed that theones to our left seemed to be dissapearing.  About a minute after we first noticed the object, it was almost directly overhead moving slowly in a North Eastern, to South Western direction.  It did not appear to emit any light, and no audible noise could be heard, although we did both feel almost like we were near speakers playing emiting a low, but constant frequency.  We could also feel that the springs surrounding the trampoline were vibrating.  It was impossible to measure the size of the object, because it was impossible to tell how far away it was, however by the way it blocked out the stars it was obviously a triangular shaped object.  It appeared to be extremely large maybe over a mile from point to point, bu! t could have been much smaller depending on how close it was. It passed at a steady pace from the moment we saw it until it was no longer in site.  I didn't think much of it until a few days later other people around the area were talking about something similar, but they had seen it during broad daylight.  According to one person who told me about it, things in his house were shaking as if there was a.  Small earthquake happening.  The other rumors were fairly consistent with what my friend and I had observed. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));43.0351;-108.2024
