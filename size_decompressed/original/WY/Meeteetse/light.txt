17 ships in triangular formation moving south to northwest.;2013-07-11 23:00:00;7 minutes;17 ships in triangular formation moving south to northwest Saw 17 bright lights of slightly orange and yellow color extremely high up in the atmosphere in a triangle formation moving at a rapid speed south to northwest over the wind river mountain range towards Yellowstone.   It was clearly evident these were desperate ships and not one as the space between the individual lights was to great.  Reminded me of what a fleet of aircraft may look like.   Watched it from my back patio until completely out of site.  I thought it was stars for a second until I saw the rate of speed and formation they were moving in.
