Strange object in the mountains of western wyoming wittnessed on 3 consecutive years on almost the same exact day every year.;2011-09-18 21:00:00;15 minutes;Strange object in the mountains of western wyoming wittnessed on 3 consecutive years on almost the same exact day every year. The past 3 septembers while bow hunting elk i have wittnessed a test tube looking object with a bright light on the bottom take off out of a timbered area. I had this thing float right over my head approx 200-400 ft off the ground. No noise. It was as if i just floated. I tried to beacon it with a flashlight and it stopped right over head. Then went on its way. I think its odd that for 3 years in a row around the same date in september this has happened. Its always right at almost dark. Whatever it was this couldnt in no way been man made. My cousin and i have even actually given it a name and wonder if it will be back once again this coming september. Right where it had taken off from we investigated the next mourning. They was a blueish, pool chalk looking dust on the ground in a huge circle. When we came back thru the area that afternoon it was as if the substance had never been there what-so-ever. The area is very mountainous. Something is going on in th! ose mountains and i dont have a clue as to what and i would actually rather not know.
