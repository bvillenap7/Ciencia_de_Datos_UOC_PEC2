Lights moving across sky, spaced out on same flight plan.  ((Starlink satellites));2020-03-25 20:45:00;More time than I had to s;Lights moving across sky, spaced out on same flight plan. Witnessed lights traveling from SW to NE on same trajectory.  Lights were spaced out to where we could see several at a time, moving faster than plane in sky.  No flashing lights.  Seemed to be self lit.  Did not dim as satellites do as they move across the night sky.  10+ objects.  We quit watching figuring they were SpaceX satellites.  ???;42.0464;-104.9699
