The sky was partly cloudy, and the temperature was about 36 degrees.  I was headed east on I80 just north of elk mountain Wyoming about 515am.  When I looked southeast towards elk mountain, I notice a dark cloud over it.  The second time I looked, I seen 3 to 4 purple or blue flashes that flashed within the cloud in a sequence that lasted about a second which illuminated the cloud to a greenish color.  I've never seen anything like this before.  The event startled me so much I almost lost control of my vehicle.;41.6838;-106.4133
