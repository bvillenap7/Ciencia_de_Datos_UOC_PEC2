Bright flashes in north sky...;2013-12-11 18:25:00;~10 seconds;Bright flashes in north sky... I was sitting outside smoking on the west side of the house on the patio.  I was looking up at the clear night sky facing north.  At an altitude approximately 10,000 ft., I saw three huge flashes of white light like huge LED's in a chevron formation in the due north sky.  The flashes were not an airplane and there was no noise as if any form of conventional aircraft.   I kept looking in the same area and there were no more flashes for another minute or so that I could see.  I could hear the neighbors' dogs barking in the distance.  This is a rural area and there is no light pollution whatsoever.  I came in and reported my sighting to the other occupants of the house.;44.7561;-108.7773
