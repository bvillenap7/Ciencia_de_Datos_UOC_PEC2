The lights were very dim. Slow, smooth momvement away from my position on my porch.  In the south-east-south sky, looked to be very low.  Moved to the south and vanished behind the trees just south of my home.   The thing made no sounds that i could hear.  Reminded me of photos i've seen in the past couple of years of craft spotted over Mexico or somewhere (i'm still looking for those photos).   The craft moved effortlessly, even rotating horizontally on its center axis, not relying on any wing configuration to keep it aloft.;44.7561;-108.7773
