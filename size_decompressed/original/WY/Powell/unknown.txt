Three star-like lights formed in a triangle w/faint light between the 3 brighter lights slowly moving across night sky--3 objects?;2020-01-16 21:30:00;5 minutes;Three star-like lights formed in a triangle w/faint light between the 3 brighter lights slowly moving across night sky--3 objects? I look at the sky often, so noticed this out of place perfectly shaped triangle formed by three lights (looked like slightly brighter stars) in the Wyoming north sky about 9:30 pm on 1/16/2020. I could see a faint light going between each of the stars to even better form the triangle.  Then I realized it was moving, very slowly to the west, maybe slightly south west. It stayed in a triangle shape, but the shape did change slightly as it moved across the sky, but always in a triangle. This made me think it was three separate objects. I told my daughter it was either military or a UFO. I watched it for 5 minutes or so. I went to get my husband to show him. By the time we got out there, we could no longer see it. My daughter was with me and also saw it.;44.7561;-108.7773
