I watched it come over the hill behind my house and I followed it over my house and it was gone. I kept asking myself if it could have been a stealth bomber, but I never heard any delayed jet noise that I hear when I see a jet.  This was without a doubt a government spy plane or a UFO.  My reason for writing this is to find out if I was the only one in this area to see this thing.  Thanks ((name deleted)) P.S. I notified my brother ( a cop) of this so if we heard anything on the news he wouldn't think I was full of it. Thanks;41.7963;-107.239
