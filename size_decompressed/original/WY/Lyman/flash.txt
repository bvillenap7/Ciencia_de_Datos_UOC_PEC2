Red/Silver flashing light going across the sky toward the south west.;2008-10-07 20:00:00;10 Minutes;Red/Silver flashing light going across the sky toward the south west. Tonight I was on my way home from my school after being on a trip. I was going west and in the south western sky I saw a very odd thing. I thought at first it was just one of the planets. I looked away for about a minute, and when I looked at it again it had moved a large distance in the sky. I then started looking at it nonstop for about 5 minutes. The object was about 2 times bigger than a regular planet appears. It also flashed red and silvery colors.It was a fairly slow moving object. I had about a 30 second chance to look at the object in my binoculars before it dipped below the horizon. It seemed to have a short red tail directly behind it. It then disappeared below the horizon.;41.3282;-110.2891
