When I said, Hello, the craft stopped and lit up.;2018-11-11 17:58:00;18:00;When I said, Hello, the craft stopped and lit up. Sunday, November 11th at 6pm, I witnessed an aircraft outside my window.  It started from the south, then headed East.  It was bright white, and was moving in a way that was completely unlike a plane or a satellite.  I naturally took out my phone and began recording.  A few moments after I did this, the craft turned red. I shouted HELLO out my window, as I did so, the craft stopped moving completely shined bright white, then it startes towards me, then back on the path it was taking originally.  I was able to capture this moment on camera, my video is posted on YouTube for the world to see. On a side note, when it started towards me, I was able to see underneath it.  The craft looked circular. ((NUFORC Note:  For some reason, source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));41.2609322580645;-110.961709677419
