8 ORANGE orbs seen flying in single file formation about 750ft up.;2014-02-25 18:35:00;10 minutes;8 ORANGE orbs seen flying in single file formation about 750ft up. One ORANGE orb caught my eye, out my living room window, where I sit with the coach under the window.  Looking S/E about 1mi away from me, a bright orange orb was coming towards me in a right to left direction.  Then I saw another orange orb, approx 1/4mi behind the first one.  Then another appeared. Then another.  Looking back at Orb#1, it was now closer...maybe .5mi away.  These orange orbs were solid in nature, no blinking, flashing, or dimming.  At any one time...my son and I saw 4 lights all in a row...stringing from left to right...with the left light being the closest and the far right being the farthest away.  It was already sundown, as this occurred just after dusk.  Now the wierd part.  All 4 of these orbs were moving slowly and smoothly, then the first orb light faded out...then orb #5 appeared.   Then orb #2 faded out and #6 orb appeared, and so on.  Until all 8 orbs eventually appeared and faded just before hitting the town limits.  These orbs did NOT change direction ever, so it's not like the 1st orb turned, and that's why I couldn't see the light.  Again, at any one time, we saw 4 or 5 of the orbs...all bright orange.   We walked out front and watched....it was dead silent....no sound at all. We should have heard sound from that distance. All orbs flew at the same altitude....I would say at about 750ft up. No trail, smoke, or fire around the orbs. Just pure orange light.  Missed out on getting a camera.  We have one now, and will look for more events, in case of repeat visit.;41.2609322580645;-110.961709677419
2 Orange-White ORBS flying southwest WYOMING into UTAH.;2015-01-31 19:25:00;15 minutes;2 Orange-White ORBS flying southwest WYOMING into UTAH. At 7:20pm MST, I looked outside towards the west of town, and saw a white orb.  The light was over the rooftops of the houses nearby but was probably about 5-10 miles away. I jumped in the car and left Evanston heading southwest when I realized there were two orbs...the original one higher in the sky, and a lower one. Both orbs were moving southwest and a slow speed at first, then faster.   I gave chase in my car, and stopped at a lookout ridge about 8mi southwest of town.  The lower orb was gone behind the distant mountains at this point, and the higher orb stayed in the lower sky for 15 minutes.  It was orangish in color and brilliant.  The higher orb eventually went below the distant mountain range.  They were heading in the direction of Ogden, UT.   I tried to take pics with a digital camera, but due to the dark sky, it picked up the ORB out of focus.;41.2609322580645;-110.961709677419
