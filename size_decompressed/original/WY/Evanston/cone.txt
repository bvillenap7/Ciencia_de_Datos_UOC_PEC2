Ice cream cone shaped object in the sky.;2014-08-11 19:45:00;2 minutes;Ice cream cone shaped object in the sky. My son and husband were outside talking to our neighbor when my son tried to get my husband’s attention and look at something.  It didn’t sound too urgent, so he did not look. After a few minutes, my son said he saw a UFO.  He came inside and drew a picture of it.  He described it as looking like an ice cream cone with lights around the top of it.  When asked the color of it he said it was metal colored.  It made no sound.;41.2609322580645;-110.961709677419
