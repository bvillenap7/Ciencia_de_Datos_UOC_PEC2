I and others have seen these crafts for months here in Wyoming.  Some of them move just a little, others move across the city, but all look the same.  They are silverish spheres with light emanating from different areas of surface.  They sometimes have round indentions, black holes or spots, or raised areas.  They often change shape and appear cut off at top or bottom, and sometimes even look egg shaped.  Looking through a 700mm telescope, they almost fill the lens and often change appearance while looking at them.  Some pulse and flash almost continuously, others emulate private planes, others simply twinkle with different colors. Myself, friends and family have been watching these ships since approx. July of last year.  At first just one, a red one.  Now there are many here in sky at night.  They start to appear at sunset, and then move lower in sky later in evening.  This has continued for months and these object don't appear to really be hiding.  I have flashed them often with mag light and they always flash me back.  Sometimes they even move closer after they are signaled. I have filed numerous reports with MUFON, but never received one reply.  I cannot help but wonder why.  Has anyone else out these seen these crafts/ships?;41.2609322580645;-110.961709677419
