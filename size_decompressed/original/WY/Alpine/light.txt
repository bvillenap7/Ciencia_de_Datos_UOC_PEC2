It's a very clear night to see the stars & we are out of town a ways so it's even clearer. We saw a stationary bright light that almost looks like Venus, It's so bright it creates what looks like a cross of light in the sky. It is low in the western sky below & to the right of Venus. Could see a red circular ball like light that appeared to be circling around the outer center of the stationary bright light as it would flash red on the far left & then red on the far right of the light.  The red ball like lights size was less than 1/4th of the size of the stationary bright light it was encircling.  Not sure how long it's been there, watched it for 10 minutes & came to write this. I just went to check & see if it was still there & it's gone.  It's now 12:25. This is the second time that I & my friend have seen this in this same place only last time it was a little higher in the western sky & it was about a year& 1/2 or so ago.  My friend noticed it first last time & said it was the same thing he had seen in Nashville sometime between 1998 & 2000.  Last time we saw a red light travel up to the stationary light & then leave it....he said that happened when he saw it in Nashville too.  Tonight we didn't see any red light coming or going. However, when I first noticed the light there was a small red light shining for a moment to the upper left of the stationary light about a foot away from the light. I looked away for a moment as I was driving at the time & when I looked back the small red light was gone. Weird.;43.1667;-111.0206
