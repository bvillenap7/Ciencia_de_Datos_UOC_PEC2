Bright white light/ resembling headlights extinguishing in seconds.;2013-05-29 23:37:00;<10 seconds;Bright white light/ resembling headlights extinguishing in seconds Between 11:30 and 11:45 I went outside to have a cigarette.  I was in the Beartooth mountain range 30 miles outside of Cody, Wy, and noticed a bright white light to the west of me.  The light first looked like a airline headlight, which was very bright given the height of the perceived object.  The light made its way to the east and lasted approximetly 10 seconds before it disappeared.  I stood outside for 5 more minutes to see if I could glimpse the craft which I thought could have possible been hidden due to the sparse clouds.  I did not see the light again. 21 year old girl.
