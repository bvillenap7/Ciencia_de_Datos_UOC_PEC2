V-shaped aircraft with underglow in Cody, WY.;2014-10-18 21:15:00;8 seconds;V-shaped aircraft with underglow in Cody, WY. We're from the neighboring town about 20 min away and we were just making a late night trip to Walmart.  We had just left Walmart and were driving out back to our home town and while we were driving there was this big bright light pretty high in the sky in the distance.    Then before we could even say what is that to each other, it was right over us.  Then it was like just sitting above this hill next to the road....and like it had a blue under glow and was V-shaped, so we pulled over right away and the second we got out it was like boom gone and not like flying off in the distance it literally like was.  I've never seen a shape like that or anything that fast.  I'm not sure of the color but from what we both remember it was a steel grey color.;44.5230999999999;-109.0756
