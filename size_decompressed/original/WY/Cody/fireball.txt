Saw very bright flash streak above me from south to north,  it disappeared before reaching north horizon so i theorize it burned itself out.  Currently visiting family in Cody area, was awake because retrieved glass of water in kitchen and amazed by brightness of stars in crisp clear night, so stepped outside onto porch to really take in the beautiful new years night sky.  Was outside mere moments before saw the fireball, felt the timing of event was very ironic and remember similar feeling on August 11, around 8:30pm in North Long Beach CA.  Decided to report this fireball tonight partially because it feels odd that i experienced these sightings within moments of stepping outside because an urge to see night sky overcomes me.  The fireball tonight in Cody, WY, region was large, quick and very very bright.;44.5230999999999;-109.0756
