It was about 4:30 AM in the morning so it was still sorta dark out. I got up to do my paper route with my friend who was staying the night. I went out to get the news papers when out of the corner of my eye two bright lights to the north above my tree caught my eye. I quickly got my friend and we looked at them for a few seconds until we went in to roll papers. On the route we kept looking at the crafts dismissing them as Venus or stars,along the way they began to move in sparatic patterns nearly missing each other. We were amazed. And when we were nearly done with the route the crafts got closer apearing to be cylinder shaped with a clear to yellow light in the center of the crafts that was fading brighter to dimmer. When we finished went in the house and got the bonoculars,The sun was nearly up when we started watching the crafts again for about three minutes until each craft straffed to the right and took off towrad the east with a sound like tire on wet pavement.;42.8407940928268;-106.313196202531
