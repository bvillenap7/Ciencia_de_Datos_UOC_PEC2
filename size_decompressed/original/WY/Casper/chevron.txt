Unexplained over Casper.;2013-11-07 01:45:00;2-3 seconds;Unexplained over Casper I just returned home from work, and as a habit, I went and sat in my hot tub outside.  I was admiring the stars, as they are plentiful in the night sky in Wyoming.  I observed 4 or 5 eteorites or falling stars.   Then, for just a couple of seconds, I noticed what looked like, now that I've had time to digest it, a hang glider.  I was observing the falling stars in a mostly eastern direction.  While scanning the rest of the sky, I spotted what I would describe as a hang glider, heading in a southwest direction.  It was very well cloaked against the sky and stars.  Almost an apparition or a shadow.  But the movements, for all of the 3 seconds that I  noticed it, where very abrupt from side to side, like it had hit different air patterns, jerky.  And then it was gone ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));42.8407940928268;-106.313196202531

It didn't make noise, but then again it looked like it was about 60000 ft up. Stepped outside my friend's apartment and saw a v-shaped arrangement of 7 reddish lights moving directly overhead from North to South at a very high speed.  I'm no expert, but my guess was it was travelling at least Mach 3 or 4.  It crossed the sky in about 5 seconds.  Much faster than a commercial aircraft.  No sound.;42.8407940928268;-106.313196202531
