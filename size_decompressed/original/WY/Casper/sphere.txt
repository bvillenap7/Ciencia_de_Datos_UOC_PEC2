The craft hovered for a few moments then sped off to the South East My wife and I were traveling South on Interstate 25 just 30 Miles north of Casper, Wyoming on 11/23/1999 at 22:30. The object appeared to be hovering towards the city of Casper. It stayed stationary for about 10-15 seconds then it slowly gained speed at first then it accelerated at a very fast rate heading SouthEast and within 30 Seconds was out of sight. The object appeared to be a very bright star while hovering then as it started to move the light became less visible. The object appeared to be at about three to five thousand feet above the ground.;42.8407940928268;-106.313196202531
Glowing object crosses road right to left - vanishes into ravine..than crosses again left to right..then away.;2005-10-05 00:00:00;30 seconds;Glowing object crosses road right to left - vanishes into ravine..than crosses again left to right..then away. Driving alone at night with another vehicle about 100 - 150 yrds ahead of me. An object apx half the size of my mini van shot across the road just behind the vehicle in front of me going from right to left.  It seemed to zip down into the bar ditch.  I slowed down to about 15mph from 55mph.  At first I thought it was a white van that had gone off the road or something as I was not sure what I was seeing at first.  As I got closer, say another 50 yards or so the light/sphere appeared again coming up out of the ravine along the left side of the road and crossed the road again.  The speed at which it moved was amazing. I can only say that it zipped and darted..  Those words describe the action of the object.   It shot into the field on the right side of the road and then accelerated so quickly that it literally vanished.  It took off at about a 45' angle to the south.  This all took place with in the space of about 30 seconds..maybe faster.   I am not sure that anyone else saw the object, there where about 3 vehicles behind me the closest being apx 100 yrds.  I had pulled over to the side and decelerated when I first saw the object cross over the road.  The object gave off enough light that it lit up the ground under it in about a 50 yrd radius. This was more apparent as it entered the field and took off than when it crossed the road. The entire object glowed white/blueish light. There was no sound that I could hear coming from it.;42.8407940928268;-106.313196202531
Multiple, white, sphericle craft pretending to be stars that stay still sometimes & move other times over Casper, Wy;2011-01-17 20:00:00;6 hours;Multiple, white, sphericle craft pretending to be stars that stay still sometimes & move other times over Casper, Wy Craft that resemble Round balls of white light observed in different parts of the sky over the city.  They resemble stars, but are not because they float around in different directions at times & then go back to being still.  They sometimes flash all the colors of the rainbow but the color is only viewable with a telescope or binoculars. This movement is hard to spot with no refrence of a stationary object, (like tree limbs or a house overhang) between us & the objects to gauge their movement & ensure it wasn't our eyes playing tricks on us.  We then brought out a powerfull 280-X telescope which revealed their movement. There is no manmade aircraft in my mind that can be manned & perform the same movements whithout turning the pilot into hamburger. That being said, I was enlisted in the Navy on an airbase & know what high performance aircraft can do & have never seen anything like this level of performance.  We used a very powerfull green laser to signal to on! e of the UFO's. After that, it began moving more and also moved more towards us, but then stopped moving & stayed stationary. They had been seen by us for over a month almost nightly before the said date.  Sometimes up to ten craft.;42.8407940928268;-106.313196202531
Saw a green orb floating/flying object above me while driving.;2012-11-07 19:30:00;15-20 seconds;Saw a green orb floating/flying object above me while driving. I was driving in my car on 2nd street going to the west side of town right by Hobby Lobby, and I noticed above me to my left, above buildings, and the electricity cables,   I then thought maybe Flight for Life helicopter headed to the hospital when suddenly the green floating orb, just disappeared.;42.8407940928268;-106.313196202531
Glowing Lime-green Orb/Sphere followed by 2 smaller white lights, stopped to hover then sped out of sight.;2020-05-30 22:30:00;10 seconds;Glowing Lime-green Orb/Sphere followed by 2 smaller white lights, stopped to hover then sped out of sight. Along the North Platte River, off of Trappers Route,on a clear night, a very bright glowing lime-green orb appeared in the sky, moving quickly above the river a short distance from where we were.  It was followed by 2 smaller bright white lights. The orb briefly stopped, hovered over the river, causing a glow reflection off of the water.  After we both were able to focus on the green orb and lights, it quickly sped out of sight.  We did not hear any sound coming from it and it was approximately 100 yards away, at the most.  We were surrounded by sagebrush and river's edge.  There were no trees or nearby light sources.  No roads or vehicle access near or where the orb appeared.;42.8407940928268;-106.313196202531
