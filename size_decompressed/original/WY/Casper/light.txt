Bright object observed and photographed;2005-02-23 14:00:00;five minutes;Bright object observed and photographed I was laid back on a park bench when I noticed a jet to my left. I watched the jet for a few seconds then noticed a bright point of light near the jet. I sat up then stood up and watched the object, then I began taking photos. The object moved north to south in a slight arc, maintaining it's brightness throughout, from about a ten o'clock position to about a two o'clock position. When I juxtiposed the object with the point of a tree branch, I noticed that it wobbled slightly and had a slightly meandering course. I turned away to notify two passers-by of the object, about two seconds, looked back and it was gone.  About a minute into the sighting I brought the object to the attention of a passerby who watched it with me for a few seconds, commented that we needed binoculars, then proceeded up the pathway. Later upon his return I offered to exchange contact info with him that he may corroborate this sighting and he refused. His opinion was that it was a mylar weather ballon.  I have approximately ten photos of the object and some contain a second faint object that I did not see at the location of the sighting. When I zoom in on the object with my photo editing program I can see dark areas around the object that change from photo to photo.;42.8407940928268;-106.313196202531
8 objects viewed at different times that pulsated and flew upward in a spiral pattern;2006-06-28 22:00:00;1.5 hrs;8 objects viewed at different times that pulsated and flew upward in a spiral pattern 8 different objects during the time period. The objects appeared to pulse like a jelly fish, hesitating and then taking off again. These objects were a bright but soft yellowish color and circled the sky in a spiral pattern before disappearing. They were too high up to see the shape, just a pulsing light. The first one circled three times before taking off. Married middle class, middle aged. House, kids and a cat. We were just enjoying a beatiful summer evening when my husband pointed out the lights. We watched until there were no more, and plan on looking again tonight.;42.8407940928268;-106.313196202531
Fast moving stars flying in a V formation.;2007-09-02 22:30:00;5 seconds;Fast moving stars flying in a V formation. I have never seen anything like this in my entire life.  I was on the deck of our home at approximately 10:30 p.m. mountain time tonight, and as I looked into the night sky (it was virtually cloudless) something caught my eye.  At first I thought it was a satellite because that is about how bright it was, but I quickly noticed it was made up of at least three objects in a forward facing V formation and it was traveling many many times faster than any satellite I have ever seen before, yet much slower than any meteorite I have ever seen. It did not leave any kind of streak behind it, or have any kind of tail, it just looked like a formation of stars in a V shape traveling in a straight line at a very high rate of speed.  I do not have an explanation for what I saw. I hope someone may by chance have seen the same thing at the same time as me somewhere in the United States.  It was on a southeast heading.  I am located in central Wyoming.  I honestly believe there were a total of five lights, I said three in the first post because I was trying to describe a V shape.  I am sure these weren't lights on the forward edge of some kind of giant object. There was no blocking out of adjacent stars around the lights. It just looked fast moving stars flying in formation, and I didn't get the sense they were even in earth's atmosphere.  When I was explaining it to my wife we did see some meteors that were streaking from the east to the west. Perhaps they were from the Aurigid shower, and we also saw a satellite or two orbiting, but trust me, I am a country kid used to seeing all kinds of stuff in the sky.  This forever changes my thoughts about what kind of stuff that out there.;42.8407940928268;-106.313196202531
Object traveled across sky, rapidly accelerated, and disappeared.;2011-07-20 22:13:00;30 seconds;Object traveled across sky, rapidly accelerated, and disappeared. I was with my father and brother in the driveway of the ranch where I work.  It is located just south of Casper, Wyoming.   We were looking at the stars because it was a particularly clear night.  The three of us noticed a point of light, equivalent to a bright star, moving across the sky.  In my estimation, it traveled 30 degrees of arc in approximately 30 seconds as we watched.  It is difficult to gauge its distance from us but we heard no noise from it.  It was travelling in an approximately northward direction, and in the north half of the sky.  My father looked away at this point, but my brother and I continued to watch.  As the object approached the area of Polaris, we saw it brighten, accelerate, and disappear all within a few moments.   The regularity of its behavior indicates that the object was a craft of some sort.  The fact that the object very quickly accelerated and vanished leads me to believe that it was travelling at a rate of speed greater th! an those possible by any known means.;42.8407940928268;-106.313196202531
A light about the brightness of a star doing figure eights and circles.;2011-08-20 23:00:00;2 minutes;a light about the brightness of a star doing figure eights and circles. It was approximately 11:00 pm and I was out on my back deck that faces north smoking a cigarette.  I was looking up at the sky like i usually do when im outside at night to look at the stars etc. I happened to look north east and noticed very high in the sky there was a light about the brightness of a star moving very quickly, faster than any of the local planes that usually fly over.  The light was not blinking any lights and there was no noise to it, there was a plane to the south east sky (blinking lights were visible and it was lower than the light I saw), the single light started to make figure eights. I quickly reached inside to shut off the back deck light to see if my my eyes were playing tricks on me, keeping my eyes on the light I hollered at my boyfriend to come outside.  The light then began to make cirles in the sky and as it finished the second circle it headed east and disappeared.  I went to the east side of my deck to check if maybe it had just ! been blocked by the trees, but it was still nowhere to be seen.  My boyfriend came out a few seconds later and I described what I saw and he agreed that he had never seen any of the local planes do something like that either.;42.8407940928268;-106.313196202531
Large gold glowing ball of light that flies west to east and disappears;2012-08-23 21:30:00;10 minutes;Large gold glowing ball of light that flies west to east and disappears I was in my front yard, watering and stargazing when a large glowing gold light showed up in the western sky about the tree tops across the street.  At first I thought it was a satellite, but it was very large and very bright. Next thought was that it was a plane, it seemed to be *flying* at a height that a plane would. There was no noise, however. It flew in a direct path over my house, directly over my head, there was no other lights, there seemed to be no visible shape.  It was just a big gold glowing ball of light.   As it headed slightly east off into the sky, it stopped glowing, it went from this glowing ball of light to a lightly dimmed star, that was still moving, till I couldn't see it anymore. I don't know if it just disappeared or because it was so dim that it blended in with the other dim stars around it that I just couldn't see it anymore. 10 mins later I went into the backyard and there was an actual US air craft with lots of flashing red and blue ! lights flying fairly low in the area & then I stood out there about a half hour later and there were two more US air crafts much higher in the sky in the same area about 5 mins a part from each other.

My children and I witnessed the bright lights over Casper over the course of half an hour.;2015-06-11 10:30:00;30 minutes;My children and I witnessed the bright lights over Casper over the course of half an hour. My children and I were headed to take my husband medicine at work at the hospital when we saw a bright light in the sky near a start.  Much brighter than a star.   At first we thought it was an airplane but couldn't see the normal red or blue lights we are use to seeing on the wings.  We watched it move in a northern direction from where we were on south McKinley all the way to the hospital on east 2nd street.   My husband met us outside to get his meds and we pointed it out to him and asked if he thought it was a plane but he too was uncertain.   The kids and I decided to investigate and drive out to Natrona County Airport to see if we could see it coming in to land but the light never came anywhere near the airport.  While on our way there were also saw another light between the star, where we originally saw the other light, and the light we'd been following.  We watched the second light move rapidly north and disappear in the blink of an eye.  On our way back to to! wn from the airport heading east, we spotted yet a third light, much lower than the first two, over the downtown vicinity.  It darted in a southerly direction very quickly (and had a trail behind it) and then disappeared.  It was really low.  Not much higher than the buildings.   None of these lights were planes, stars, or shooting stars.  They all looked the same.  Fascinating.;42.8407940928268;-106.313196202531
