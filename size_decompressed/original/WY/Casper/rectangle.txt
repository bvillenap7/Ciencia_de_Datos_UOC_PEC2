A CD case like craft hovered for 20 minutes over mountian line.;2005-06-06 15:52:00;20 min;A CD case like craft hovered for 20 minutes over mountian line. I was just walking home from the mall along Wyoming Blvd when I stopped to tie my shoe, I set my things down quickly tied my shoe and stood back up, while getting up I tilted my head up and saw what looked like a chrome bumper floating in the air about around the altitude of the mountians. it was kind of easy to miss, the craft didnt apear to move for sometimeand stayed that way for a while. Theres a mini-mart along that road were I used a payphone to call a friend to ask if he was seeing what I saw, He lives on Fairdale Ave nearly two or so miles from my location he went outside and saw the same thing I asked him to describe it and and got the same thing,only he said it was solid black. Luckily there were two police officers at the store at the time. I quickly asked both of them if they too say the craft. Both saw it, one even took out some binoculars. We all looked and when I did I could tell then that the craft seemed almost compressed and square like a CD case. After a few more minuets the craft started traveling westward finaly turning south and disapeared over the mountians.
