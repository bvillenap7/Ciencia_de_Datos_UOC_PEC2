The object was pale, luminous and green/blue in color. Observed a boomerang shaped object travelling roughly South to North at 2:18 a.m. looking toward the east. The object was pale, luminous and green/blue in color. The color and amount of glow seemed to be an attempt to make the craft inconpicuos if that is possible! I heard no unusual sounds, none that seemed to emit from the craft. It seemed to be travelling quite high in the atmospere. I would estimate that a silver dollar held at arms length would have covered the object. It was not directly overhead, slightly lower angle. As it moved further to the north I began to see small, bright white lights on the back inside curve of the boomerang. The object moved at a steady speed and did not change direction. I observed it from between one to two minutes until I lost sight of it in the tops of the trees that run along the nort side of our property. This ocurred on the morning of a meteor shower but I have never seen a meteor look or behave this way!;42.8407940928268;-106.313196202531

I ran I was was watching the Northern lights with my Aunt and Dad (we drove about 4 miles out side of town).  There was a light dancing in the sky, making circles going forword then back.  It took me a couple minutes to convince my Dad it was a UFO when he agreed we went home.  When we got there I went back outside to watch the dancing light with the binoculars.  I had to cross the street to get the trees out of my view.  After about 30 minutes I noticed there was something in the sky moving towrd me from the same direction (north).  It seems grey, kind of see through, I thought maybe a cloud moving on the breeze?(completely clear night)  There were no lights on the front and the glossy black nose of the craft was just reflecting the city lights below. I could see it but not yet identify it.   It made no sound.   As it got closer it was flying very low, as it came over my head I relized it was a huge triangle with 3 sets of triangle lights on the bottom, the lights were bright but did not shine on the tops of the houses or trees.  It was less then a half a block to the East of me and low enough a major league pitcher could have hit it with a ball.  It banked to turn East.  As my terror subsided I ran fast back into my Dad's house shaking.;42.8407940928268;-106.313196202531
4 triangular orange and red lighted in casper, wyoming;2004-02-14 22:25:00;10 minutes;4 triangular orange and red lighted in casper, wyoming There were 4 flying quite low like an airliner would to take off or land. We seen one, turned and seen another, and 2 more. Each were seeming to go in all 4 opposite directions. The bottoms looked like airline planes but had red and orange big lights, somewhat like traffic lights. I am a stocker at walmart and my son is 15 we saw them together. He said what is that, I said some weird plane but then there were more, too close to be airline planes they would have crashed. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.  PD));42.8407940928268;-106.313196202531
A silent fast moving V formation of lights, faint, but extremely fast like it was in outer space.;2013-07-01 01:00:00;5 seconds;A silent fast moving V formation of lights, faint, but extremely fast like it was in outer space. I was on the roof of our house, looking at the stars.  It was a very clear and quiet night.  I am used to seeing satellites overhead, and when something caught my attention out of the corner of my eye I expected it to be one of these.  But once I locked onto it and my vision adjusted to it, it was not a satellite.   It was a V of white colored lights, with one at the tip, and two down each side, like geese in formation.  The magnitude of their brightest was like that of a dim star or satellite.  I picked it up at about an 11 o'clock position in the sky.  It was moving at an enormous rate of speed, so that it had passed over my position and down to a 2 or 3 o'clock position and out of sight.  There were no clouds, it just faded to nothing.   The whole sighting took place in 4 or 5 seconds.  There was no sound, no debris like a meteor would normally shed while it went.  Their was not outline visible, only the shape of the white lites.  Everything about it gave me! the sense it was beyond our atmosphere and very far in space.  I knew when I saw it that it was something incredible.   I waited for approximately 20 minutes to see if I would see anything else, while trying very hard to process what I had seen.  I have never seen anything in my life that caused me such excitement and bewilderment.  I felt 100% that I had just witnessed a UFO sighting.   I cannot say if it was man-made or not.  I went and told my wife, and drew a picture of what I saw on a piece of paper for some reason.   The next morning I felt I needed to call a few people just to tell them how weird and amazing the experience was.  I will not forget it.;42.8407940928268;-106.313196202531

I assumed it would be an aircraft but i quickly realized that it had no beacon lights!  This object was flying very low at an altitude of maybe 1000 ft.  It was traveling to the south west at a steady rate but was going slower than an airplane or chopper.  It had two very bright rear facing lights parallel to eachother and it appeared to be shaped like a tri-angle this object was quite close at most maybe only a third of a mile away from me when it was at its closest point.  There was absolutley no sound as it flew.  I do not believe it to be a man made object but rather or not i cant say but i dont think we have the technology to fly and propell forward such a large craft with out making a sound!!  WOW!;42.8407940928268;-106.313196202531
