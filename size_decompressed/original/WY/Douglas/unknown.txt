My family and I see in the moonlight a somewhat transparent object in a crescent or saucer shape (maybe) fly across the sky then change direction.  We waited, then it returned randomly for the next 45 minutes.  No lights on the craft, just a distortion of the stars around it.  My family and I have never seen anything like that, and know how planes act at night.  Low flying craft with no lights or sound, with very little visual indication unless you see it at the right time.  The 4 sightings were all at different elevations and different spots in the sky. We thought it was clouds the first time, but the other sightings reassured us of what we had seen. Fast moving, maybe visible in the sky for 10 seconds on each pass. As there was no light, we could not capture on camera.;42.7615;-105.3952
