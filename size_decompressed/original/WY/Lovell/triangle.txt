Translucent looking triangle object, no sound.;2016-10-10 01:20:00;5 seconds;Translucent looking triangle object, no sound. We were walking our dog and decided to look for owls in the trees...as I looked up saw a translucent looking triangle shaped object flying, could not hear any sound.  Told my boyfriend to look up & he saw it too.  Both of us saw no lights, heard no sound, & saw that it was almost transparent.  It was lightly cloudy and the object looked slightly darker than the clouds around it.  Could definitely tell that it was a large triangle though..;44.8405;-108.4128
