Flying Manta Ray with short tail near Pinedale,WY;2000-06-23 08:00:00;?;Flying Manta Ray with short tail near Pinedale,WY On 1/3/02, I requested from a freind if he could scan some print photos of my kid's and a trip I made to Wyoming in June,2000. I droped them off over at his place and returned home. We are both within FRS communication range from our homes. I decided I was going to try to catch a nap, but prior to drifting off, he called on the radio and requested I come back over to look closer at one of the pictures I took in Wyoming. Upon arriving and inspecting this picture, I saw an object I previously considered to be a sun dog. As it turns out, this object, at around 600 percent zoom in BMP format was without a doubt, a UFO. I took the scanned photos and a CD he had tranferred them to, and returned home. I loaded the images into my hard drive and opened Adobe Photoshop 5 to edit. After only rendering x2 in PNG format, I could see an extremely detailed craft:  The craft appeared to be making a 90 degree turn at which it left me a view of the top of it. There was a short moisture contrail behind it suggesting the path and turn. There are visible short extrusions on both sides I take to be wings but these have a forward curved appearance and come to a sharp tip which seems as though the extrusions that are coming from the main body of the craft and ended up curved toward the bottom of the craft and then forward. What I feel is the top view of the craft, I note two dooms side by side but with gentle curves and a forward aft oblong doom, just shy of the nose of the craft which I took to be an intake of some sort. The craft is displaying reflection from the snow capped mountains as well as sun reflection. With the contrail of this craft, I would compare it to a flying Manta Ray.
