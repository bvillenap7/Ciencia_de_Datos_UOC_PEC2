Jackson Hole clouds morph into flying discs.;2019-04-21 05:30:00;30 minutes;Jackson Hole clouds morph into flying discs. At approximately 530 in the morning I was driving to work at a hotel in the Teton Village. As I was driving down Moose Wilson road I noticed two huge round cloud formations floating over the Teton mountains.  This caught my eye for two reasons, the first being the fact that the sky was clear, 360 degrees around and the second was the fact that the second formation was emitting a vapor trail.  I rushed to the parking lot, jumped out of my car and began to search for these clouds.  Interestingly enough, the two clouds were now just one. The single cloud began to morph into a flattened shape and break into two more clouds as it moved to the north over the Jackson airport at an approximated altitude of 3000 feet above ground level.  At that time two small black disks traveled out of the cloud backwards in my direction and morphed into two more clouds.  I ran into the hotel and grabbed the front desk manager telling him to come outside to witness my claim.  We watched! for 5 minutes as these clouds again emitted six more disks, each becoming its own cloud.  At that time a guest came outside and asked why we were watching those clouds when he himself also saw the clouds change shape and emit two more disks.  Both witnesses exclaimed: what the hell is that.  The clouds floated further to the north until they were no longer close to our proximity.  I am a private pilot and have been flying for over 20 years and never have I witnessed anything like this that defies logic.  What we witnessed that morning was not explainable.;43.5917;-110.8367
