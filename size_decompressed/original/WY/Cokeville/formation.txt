At about 9:15 PM I looked to the north and I saw what appeared to be an airplane in the night sky to the north.  The object had a red light on it and a white light on it.  I continued walking, but when I looked back a minute later I noticed that the object had not moved at all.  Thinking that this was weird I stopped and watched the object for a couple minutes.  The object continued to stay in the same spot in the sky for the entire time that I watched it. I continued walking toward my house while watching the object, and as I neared my house I ran inside to tell my family to come look at the UFO. They immediately ran out to see it, but by the time we looked again it had vanished.  After talking to them about the object my brother informed me that a friend of his had seen it the night previous in a similar area of sky.;42.058;-110.9164
