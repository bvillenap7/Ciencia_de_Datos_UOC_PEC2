Strange Craft By North Casper;2010-04-30 21:30:00;45 minutes;Strange Craft By North Casper I have been seeing a strange craft north of Casper about 10 miles from my house in evansville.  It has strange lights that seem to move around the craft.  I have noticed it in the same place for the past 4 nights now at the exact same time in the exact same place.  It seems to stay around for about 45 minutes then just disappears.   I had a friend over one night and showed them the craft and just as she was telling me i was crazy, we both watched the light just fade away to just an outline with a dull white haze where the craft was.  Just like it vanished.   Later i was looking in that general direction at the stars, or what i thought were stars, but they were unusually bright and not twinkling like a normal star and just then a very small dot raced from one to the other and then the 2nd star also vanished....    Am i just crazy, or what.  I definately know this thing has been showing up like clockwork but i can't seem to get a clear view without a telescope or something.  Wish i could get video....;42.9003;-106.1701
