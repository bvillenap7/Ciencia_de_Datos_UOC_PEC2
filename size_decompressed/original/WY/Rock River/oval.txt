Carrier retrieves two small craft southeast of Rock River, Wyoming.;2002-07-15 15:00:00;2 minutes;Carrier retrieves two small craft southeast of Rock River, Wyoming. My wife reports seeing a very bright silvery-white oval craft traveling from east to west about seven miles south of Rock River, Wyoming, east of the road as she was northbound on US 287 (also known as US 30).  She then saw another craft, identical to the first, traveling from west to east, west of the road.  Then a third craft, much larger than the other two, but otherwise identical in shape and color, was seen hovering west of the road.  The two small craft each stopped to either side of the large craft, hovered for 10 to 15 seconds, then the craft to the west merged with or entered the carrier.  Five or so seconds later, the small craft to the east entered or merged with the carrier.  For 10 or 15 seconds after this operation, the large craft remained stationary.  It then accelerated straight up and disappeared within one to two seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));41.7443;-105.9698
