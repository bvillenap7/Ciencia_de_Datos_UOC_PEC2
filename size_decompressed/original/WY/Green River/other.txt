Rare occurence of lights from the home of close encounters(the movie);1999-07-01 23:00:00;1 hour +;Rare occurence of lights from the home of close encounters(the movie) My report is not a UFO sighting.  Rather, it was someyhing out of norm.  If you'll look at a Wyo map, you'll see there is nothing civilized north of our town.  There is however a visual landmark mesa called Pilot Butte.  During the Oregon/Mormon Trail movement it was used for navigation.  A stretch of the imagination compares it to Devil's Tower as in Dreyfus' mashed potatoes (dah- dah- dah- duh- da). I grew up in California and frequently observed the giant search lights used for grand openings and movie premiers.  There aren't any of these lights in Wyoming and someone who hasn't lived elsewhere wouldn't be familiar other than the 20th Century Fox Movie intro.  I witnessed these type of lights reflecting off of some thunderheads north of town.  The closest town to us is Rock Springs which is 15 miles to the east (check the maps it really is intrigueing).  Are they up to something in our remote area?  Just thought it was interesting so I wrote.;41.522;-109.4704
