Two red orbs traviling west, over Green River, Wyoming.;2011-06-16 23:30:00;45 seconds;Two red orbs traviling west, over Green River, Wyoming In green river Wyoming, at about eleven thirty at night, a friend and I were outside on the patio looking south at roughly thirty degree angle in the sky. On the east horizon I saw two red orbs that were roughly a hundred feet apart, and pulsing from a red to a amber color. They were moving along at a very fast speed, and no sound what so ever. With the speed of a jet they moved over the city, I’m guessing at roughly a hundred to two hundred feet above the ground, they stopped over the city for a second and moved strait up by about a hundred feet. After that they continued on over the city on the westward course it was originally on, until it went out of my line of sight. There wasn’t a lot of clouds in the sky, and no ambient light was coming from surrounding houses or street lights. It couldn’t have been a glare on glass because we were outside. It wasn’t a plane because it was too close to the ground and moving to fast. The only conclusion of the citing was that it was in fact a U.F.O. though out my life I never really believed in extra terrestrial beings, but without a doubt in my mind this was real. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and we found him to be quite objective and sincere.  We suspect that both he, and the other witness, are quite reliable, and very good witnesses.  PD));41.522;-109.4704
