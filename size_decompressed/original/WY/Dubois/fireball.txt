Bright , fast falling light;2001-01-11 21:50:00;1.5 sec;Bright , fast falling light Driving from Riverton to Dubois, Wyoming. Saw a flash of light NW of me. I was heading west on Hwy 26, and thought it was a meteor, but I was listening to KOA radio in Denver, and they were talking about this bright light that was seen at the same time I saw mine.  It was headed toward the ground at a great rate of speed, and at the time we had a lot of cloud cover. This light was below the ceiling.;43.5395;-109.6546
