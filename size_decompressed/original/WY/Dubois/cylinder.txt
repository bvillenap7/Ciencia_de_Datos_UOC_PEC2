Perfectly circular holes in object on cloud.;2014-07-09 13:00:00;1 second;Perfectly circular holes in object on cloud Just yesterday (9/2/2014) we were looking at pictures that we took from Hwy 287/26 in Wyoming and noticed this white object in the sky of one of the pics that looks like Casper the Ghost from far away.   When I zoomed in on it, it looks like a portion of an edge of a circular disc with 4 perfectly circular holes, one of which is not closed.   We have another picture of the same sky taken minutes later and this object is not in the picture.  If you zoom in on the object, it is clear that it is part of the cloud formation - but so odd, we can not imagine what could cause these perfect holes.;43.5395;-109.6546
