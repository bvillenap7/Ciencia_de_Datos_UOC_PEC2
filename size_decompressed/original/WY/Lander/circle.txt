I was just watching TV when I saw a flash and looked out the window.  I had been looking for several seconds when I saw a circle shaped light out in the distance but fairly high in the sky.  then it turned green and dove for the mountains where it disappeared.  I kept watching the horizon but nothing else happened.  It freaked me out because it reminded me of the footage I have seen of bombs in the middle east.  thats why I had to report it.;42.9208;-108.5913
