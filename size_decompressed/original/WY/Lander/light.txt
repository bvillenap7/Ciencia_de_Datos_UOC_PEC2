The light vanished quickly Two friends and I took a ride up Sinks Canyon which is approximately 10 minutes south of Lander.  We were going on a drive and it was the middle of winter.  We looked up and saw a bright white light.  We were sitting in a one seater pickup truck.  I thought perhaps it was the moon.  My friends corrected me and the moon was on the opposite side of the sky.  It appeared to be a large floating white light.  It was a couple thousand feet above the top edge of the canyon.  We started to talk about it and it turned to an orange light.  It looked like it had moved a mile across the sky within seconds and vanished entirely.;42.9208;-108.5913
