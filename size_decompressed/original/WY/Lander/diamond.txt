It hovered high above the mountain/frozen lake in shoshoni national forest.  It turned from orange to green to blue and back to orange Moved slightly, about two fingers width at arms lenght returned to the origional position and then either disapeared or turned blue again about 2 min later.  Witnessed by myself, wife, my 3 kids and two other men on a snowmibile outing.  We have one picture taken with a digital camera.  My wife was too flustered to get the camera to work right the other two times.  But we do have one good photo. No sound and no movement before it went away.
