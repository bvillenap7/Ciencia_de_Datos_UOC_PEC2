Then Three , Then more. Six in total. Had to have been Space Craft with all of the manuevers. I think they were space craft by the maneuvers they did in the sky.  They where round in shape as observed. Bright yellow white in color.  Two sighted first.  Then three. Others flew up to them.  Others appeared I think it was. .  Some faded away either leaving the area  or turned there lights off.  One proceeded to fly northwest.  The first ones where heading north.  Also one dropped down to make all appear in an L shape.  My sister seen them after getting off of work last night.  She is going to write down what actually  occurred.  She has a photo of one.  Poor shot I guess.  She drove to a darker part of town to view objects better.  Objects seemed to be in the sky just on the edge of Sheridan to the north.  The craft ran silent.  I found my sisters story very exciting.;44.7862;-106.9608
Staggered line of objects in the sky over Northern Wyoming.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-17 20:05:00;15 minutes;Staggered line of objects in the sky over Northern Wyoming While outside tonight observed an object moving from South to north. Thought it was a satellite then realized another trailed behind it then 2 more appeared behind then at regular intervals more came from the south more or less in a line. Behind the 5th light there was a smaller light chasing it but at a different path more diagonal and dimmer than the one it trailed. Only 2 of the 11 observed got very bright then dimmed back to a modest bright light whereas the rest didn't seem to fluctuate in brightness. They moved quite fast and steady accross the clear sky til they disappeared one by one just like they appeared from the south.;44.7862;-106.9608
