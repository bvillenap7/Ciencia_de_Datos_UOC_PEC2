Multiple white lights suddenly appear over wyoming.  ((NUFORC Note:  Starlink satellites?  PD));2019-11-25 05:20:00;5;Multiple white lights suddenly appear over wyoming I was waking up for a the morning hunt 10 miles south of the Tongue river reservoir when I was looking up at the sky to the east  and observed 4 or 5 bright lights suddenly appear in the sky out of no where. The objects where spaced apart at equal distances and traveling south to north. I looked away and closed my eyes for a moment and looked up again and watched them continue to travel north. After a minute or two of watching them more began to appear at the same place the others appeared, approximately 10 more began to appear one at a time at equal distance and speed from each other but there were a few traveling in pairs. Watch them travel north until they went out of view.  All of them emitted a bright steady light as they traveled.  There were no blinking or colored lights observed that would indicate conventional aircraft.;44.7862;-106.9608
