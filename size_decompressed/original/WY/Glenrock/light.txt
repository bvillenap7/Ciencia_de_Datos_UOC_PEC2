While standing in my front yard walking a friend to his car I looked up into the south east sky I noticed three planets shining brightly and thought WOW three planets out at once really bright, but one of these bright objects started to move at a high rate of speed shining as bright as the brightest planet I've ever seen!   The trajectory of this bright object was straight Southwest to Northeast across the sky.  No sound was heard!  The most amazing part was the size and the brightness.  After about three minutes the UFO had gone clear across the sky and vanished over the horizon.   At the same time there was a aircraft in the North central sky, you could see the directional lights only on this aircraft, so It was one of ours and there was sound.  Then about 15 minutes after the UFO there was a jet that went over with directional lights and you could hear the jet engines.  Well thats it.;42.7803;-105.8719
