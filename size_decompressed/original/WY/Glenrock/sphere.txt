White Sphere in Southern Sky over Glenrock;2018-08-14 20:15:00;30;White Sphere in Southern Sky over Glenrock Just past sundown observed very bright white light in same area of western sky as normal Venus, but it was far too high.   Upon checking with binoculars, it was a spherical object white in color with dark markings in middle.  It almost looked like a miniature version of the full moon, however the moon was crescent and visible near the horizon.  Object moved slowly from west to east across southern sky before eventually disappearing.  Object had intermittent bright white lights blinking on body.  Speed was very slow, not a normal aircraft or satellite speed.;42.7803;-105.8719
