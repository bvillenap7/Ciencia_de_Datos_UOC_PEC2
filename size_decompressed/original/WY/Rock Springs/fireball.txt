I was on patrol (I work as a Deputy Sheriff) and was driving north on a local road when I saw through my windshield, a greenish/blue fireball travelling across the sky in front of my car.  I could see it going from west to east, as if it was following the interstate highway, (interstate 80).  It was moving faster than what a plane would travel, but slower than a falling star.  I have seen plenty of falling stars, and this did not have the same characteristics, mainly the fact that it was brighter, and larger, and did not lose substance as it travelled.  It went east over the horizon as far as I could see.  A fellow officer who was working also remarked on the radio that he had seen it also.;41.606928;-109.227642666667
