I was driving home from a daytrip at roughly midnight. I noticed three bright lights at the top of some foothills.I pulled my truck over and got out. Something was forcefully holding my eyes on these luminating objects. I watched them for 5-10 minutes. Then a flash and they were gone. They didn't really disapear. There was a bright flash and then they made a sharp turn and were below the foothills as quickly as they appeared.I was scared ((deleted)). ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We do not know whether the witness mean the date was the morning or evening of June 07th.  PD));41.606928;-109.227642666667
It was like an airport becon that was rotating with red, green, and white lights.;2003-01-08 20:15:00;1 hour;It was like an airport becon that was rotating with red, green, and white lights. My wife and I observed what we first thought was a bright star or planet in the north western sky. It was like an airport becan that was rotating with red, green, and white lights. When the red and green lights were visible there was a white light that appeared to be under the object. When rotating to white, the object became brighter. It seemed to be stationary for a period appx 45 minutes and then began to move in a northern direction. We observed this object for quite some time as it moved away. It then dissapeared.;41.606928;-109.227642666667
Bright light rapidly moved toward my friend n I, changing shape n color;2010-09-13 21:30:00;2 minutes;Bright light rapidly moved toward my friend n I, changing shape n color A bright light came towards my friend and I as we were out behind some hills on 430.  The light was far off in the distance and did not resemble any kind of vehicle lights we had ever seen since it was only one light.  The light started out in a roundish blue shape and very qucikly came in our direction spreading out in a vertical direction and becoming more of a white bright bright light.  We quickly turned my Yukon around and took off. It travelled so far in seconds!;41.606928;-109.227642666667

While driving home, I observed 3 orange lights floating over the interstate.;2014-05-24 22:00:00;~5 minutes;While driving home, I observed 3 orange lights floating over the interstate. While driving home, I observed 3 orange lights in the sky.  At first I only noticed 1 and it looked like the distant glow of a fire.   As I continued driving however I noticed 2 others. I was driving east and the lights appeared to be moving very slowly in a southern direction.  This was how I realized that they were not fires.   Based on how their position relative to me changed as I was moving, I would estimate their position to be approximately 1 mile away and ½ to 1 mile in elevation.  They appeared to be moving over the interstate.  I observed the lights for about 5 minutes, until I passed beneath the interstate.  Upon reaching the other side of the interstate, I looked back and the objects were gone.;41.606928;-109.227642666667
Dancing lights in formation at times-pulsating light dim out and reappear - 3-4 hours.;2014-05-25 20:00:00;3-4 hours;Dancing lights in formation at times - pulsating light dim out and reappear - 3-4 hours My son and I camped on the north side of Steamboat Mountain in the Red desert north and east of Rock Springs, Wy.  Approximately 35-40 miles.  We were at approx. 8300, facing north.  Off a 4wd road.   We arrived at approx 8pm and started making camp before dark.  My son pointed out a very bright light to the north of us at ground level.  I told him that it may be a vehicle with bright lights on a dirt road in distance.  Our view that night was very clear all the way to the Wind River Mountains approx. 40-50 miles.   After setting up tents and making a fire we sat facing the north and almost immediately, a second light appeared and started to move erratically above the ground.  A third, and fourth light appeared and would pulsate and then disappear and then reappear.  Once all four lights appeared in a perfectly spaced line at approx our same altitude.  Maybe a mile or two across.  Perfectly spaced.  At times two would come together and  seem to dip below the hills and move very rapidly up and dance in the sky.  I have no idea as to size so distance was hard to judge but I would guess 5-10 miles out.   We watched them for 3-4 hours.  No sound.  At times would move farther out but would come back. Lights on and then off.  We did not have binoculars and tried taking a video with IPhone.  It did not come out all that well.   I am in my late 50's and have spent allot of time in remote areas and have never seen anything like this.  At first we were somewhat spooked but they seemed to never come closer than what I estimated above.   We watched them until approx midnight and went to bed.  We had no cell service, or I would have notified the sheriffs dept. that they were missing quite a show.   We camped out at a lower altitude the next night facing same direction hoping that we may see them again.  Nothing the second night.   An expierience that I wil remember for awhile.;41.606928;-109.227642666667
