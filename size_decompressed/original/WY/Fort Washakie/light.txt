lights that appear to be stars, blending in with the night stars;1975-07-07 19:00:00;20 seconds;lights that appear to be stars, blending in with the night stars I recently heard your program on coast to coast, 2-16-09, I would like to briefly give you some back ground information of where I live, I was born and raised in west central Wyoming at the foot of the wind river mountains, putting me on the east side of the rocky mountains in WY very sparsely populated. I personally believe that whatever or whoever is controlling these objects, lights I have seen most of these at night and two shiny objects in the day time, that glimmered for a few seconds and disappeared. That they can operate in relative anonymity because of the back drop of the mountains coupled with no population towards the west and into the rocky mountains until you reach the very western portion of WY and encounter sparse populations again. 	I have never written or reported what I am about to describe as my experiences, I have only talked about this with close friends or family members, some of them have seen what I have seen. I am compelled to write about these experiences, for some of them I have never heard or read about anywhere, but may have been reported to this site. In the mid 1970's, when I was around 13 yrs old, I was walking home from a friends house at night after sunset, getting dark. I was startled to see about a mile away a bright white light, that did not light up the surrounding area and had the luminosity of that of a star, rise and fall behind a hill in a circular motion, this happened in a couple of seconds. I was in shock when I got home and wondered about what I had seen for days (it was at this point I became open minded about reading of UFO sightings and all the strange stories that came with UFO sightings, abductions, contacts. etc...). When I was around 17, I was coming home from work, traveling in westerly direction towards home about a mile away (my home is at 6,200 ft, foothills, traveling up the switch backs for another Â½  mile you can be at 12,000 ft ), it was getting dark, something was just not right for a few seconds in the sky when I noticed that a star was bigger than any star should be was in the sky, if it was not for its size I probably would not have noticed. This star slowly fell from the sky and into a canyon, the walls on the canyon were turning different colors red, green, blue as this light fell into the canyon. For weeks and months I scanned the skies to see if I could see anything similar I became aware of the stars, planets, planes and satellites and always kept glancing at the night sky to see anything out of the ordinary I seen none. In my late 30's I was at my parents home, in the living room watching TV, the TV was in the corner and next to the TV was a large picture window that faced in an easterly direction. I seen what appeared to be a shooting star that fell from a north to south direction. It streaked across the sky, burned out. But then reappeared and was bobbing up and down in the air and slowly stopped, it then moved slowly across the hills in a southerly direction and was turning different colors of red, green and blue, until it disappeared from sight about 15 to 20 seconds and about 100 to 200 feet above the ground. Also around this same time (months) I was walking my infant son back and forth in my trailer and when passing a small window I seen a bright white light (star) that was traveling horizontally in a westerly direction towards the mountains, before it reached the mountains it went out. The next day and this was in the middle of July the face of the mountain in a circular pattern looked like it was covered in light snow in the area of where I seen the light. My mother had seen this as she was washing dishes, we planned to go to the side of the mountain to see what this was, but it rained within a couple of hours and this light white snow looking stuff was gone, this was about 10 am in the morning. My wife, older son, brother in law and nephews all seen this and could only wonder what it was. Another strange deal is what I have thought to be satellites. In the early 90's I, my wife, nephew and cousin were lighting fire works I had a flashlight to see the fuses when they were lit. I noticed what appeared to be a satellite that was moving through the sky and told everyone look there is a satellite moving in the sky. My wife said where, I pointed with the flashlight on, at the satellite. My wife seen it moving along with my nephew right as I pointed the light at it and we all seen it stop and remain motionless and became a fixture as part of the stars. Needless to say I have had the same experiences on a couple of other occasions with these so called satellites that stop in the sky once they are noticed (weird).

Observed a still standing white silver red light blinking.;2014-01-23 23:00:00;1 hour;observed a still standing white silver red light blinking. Dear National UFO Reporting Center,                                    1/26/2014    I do not claim to be abducted but there are a few stories I would like to share with your facility.  I also would like to report a possible UFO sighting. When I was about twelve years of age I was sitting on my grandparents roof experimenting with cigarettes.  At that time back in 1996 my grandparents home was surrounded by hay fields and about 150 yards from a rural residential road on the Wind River Indian Reservation.  I happened to look up out into the hay field and right where a irrigation ditch is I had seen a green and red and white light changing colors.  I could tell it was only about five feet off the ground. I had thought it was another kid out in the field with one of those toy flashlights that change color.  I do not remember climbing down off the roof nor do I remember going to bed. (this was about 10:00 pm)  Through out my teenage and in my early twenties I had never given the sighting another thought. when I was a teenager my grandmother had given me the book ''Intruders'' by respected Budd Hopkins.  The book had sat in my bedroom closet for years collecting dust. I did not read the book until the summer of 2013 and I started remembering the strange lights I had seen out in the hay field.  I am a Native American and as you probably know my heritage is  strongly influenced by the supernatural and paranormal.  After reading Intruders I was thinking ''what would a little kid be doing way out in the hay field at night'' then I theorized that maybe it was a alcoholic walking through the field with one of those toy flashlights'' because there has been a lot of alcoholics in my community who would walk out in the fields to someone's house. I spoke with a Native American shaman and had described what I had seen.  I did not go to him for help we are friends and we was talking about the talk show ''coast to coast'' the medicine mad had told me that he thought that it was not a human nor was it an evil spirit roaming around that it very well could have been something from not of this world. I truly believe that it was something extra terrestrial. Another incident that I would like to share is that when I was twenty six I had a very strange dream that seemed real. I felt like I was awake and conscious but at the same time it was a dream. In this strange state of mind I had seen several green orbs floating around me. something or somebody was speaking to me but I could not hear a voice nor could I speak. The information I had received was in my head. I know there is a word for it but I can not think of it right now. I think the word I am looking for is telepathy. As these green orbs were floating around me I was told that if I do not do this one certain thing that I would be killed. I strongly believe that extra terrestrials were communicating with me. I don't know how exactly but I feel in my heart and with all my soul that they were in fact ET's. I have thought this through a lot and am very confused as to why would they threatened me like that? I sometimes think that mayby they were not being malicious but giving me a warning and trying to help me because at that time I was in a very dangerous situation where my life was actually in danger. In Native American Culture we do have stories of ''star people'' coming to earth and visiting with tribal elders. These ''star people'' are not out to hurt or destroy humans. I strongly believe that aliens are real but I just cannot accept the thought that I was abducted.....here is my UFO sighting.... I was laying in bed with my curtains open and there is a big pine tree outside my window. I had seen a blinking white or silver light through the tree branches and thought it was a star. I got up about twenty minutes later and had noticed that the light was gone. I was looking out the window and had noticed the same light hovering over the Wind River Mountains on the Wind River Indian Reservation. I thought to myself that cant be a star why did it move like that? I thought it was an airplane then I realized if it was in fact an airplane then it would be moving but it was just sitting there blinking it was mostly white/silver and as I peered at it longer and concentrated on it. I could see it change to a faint red color and it was just sitting there blinking. I know now that it was not a star no an airplane and the only conclusion I could think of was that it must have been a UFO. There have been reported sightings on this Reservation of bigfoot but never has anybody reported seeing a UFO. I personally think  that by becoming interested in aliens and reading Intruders and listening to coast to coast that somehow I attracted ET's . I have never seen a ''grey'' only the strange lights as a child and the green orbs in my dream. I am a recovering alcoholic and marijuana addict. I have been clean and sober for three years so I know what I saw the other night was not an hallucination. I was in a very normal state of mind. Anyway the strange blinking lights I had seen was just sitting there not moving. The lights were right above the Wind River Mountains on the Wind River Indian reservation. Thank you for reading my story and please take into consideration my sighting of a possible UFO. God bless! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
