Bright ball of light shoots toward ground in Southeastern Wyoming.;2002-02-09 20:30:00;1 second?;Bright ball of light shoots toward ground in Southeastern Wyoming. As my son and I were driving south in the city, I glanced to the west just as a large bright ball of light shot to toward the ground in the western sky.  It was about 8:30MST, pitch black dark with no stars out. The object appeared as a large, very bright, white/yellow ball, with no tail.  It appeared into our view, shot down at about a 45 degree angle and was lost behind the houses and trees.  It looked much brighter than any shooting star I have ever seen, and much closer.  From our view, it looked as if it must have landed maybe 30-50 miles to the west of Cheyenne, Wy.  But I do realize that actually it could have been much farther than that, maybe hundreds of miles? I am no expert on these matters, just speaking in terms of what kind of seems logical I guess. I looked over at my son, he immediately looked at me and his eyes were just huge!  I said, did you see that?, and he said acting very excited and scared at the same time, ya!  So, just to test him to see if he really indeed saw the same thing I did, I said what did you see?  He replied, that shooting star!, he being only 6, I knew what he meant, and knew we had both definitely seen the same thing.;41.1462407329842;-104.807641780105
Fireball seen in night sky near Cheyenne WY Thanksgiving evening;2002-11-28 18:30:00;5 seconds;Fireball seen in night sky near Cheyenne WY Thanksgiving evening Traveling south on Railroad Road toward the Sapp Bros. truck stop 10 miles east of Cheyenne, WY I witnessed a huge fireball fall from the clear night sky and hit the ground just south of I-80.  The limited view from my windshield was short, but a huge fireball the size of a plane with a long tail of flames and smoke lit up the night sky.  I crossed the interstate at exit 370 and turned off my lights but could see nothing...  once in town I told friends of the siting and several of us went back out to the crash site and drove through large pastures looking for the site of impact. Curiously we were the only people out there.  I called the county sheriff's office and was told that other people had reported seeing a meteor or were concerned of a possible plane crash... but the object I saw was traveling far too fast to just be a falling plane.  Surprisingly there has been nothing in the local news of this event and the only other witness I know of is my 14 year old daughter who I'd left at her mother's when I went into town, she said she saw the very same thing on her way out to feed her horses.  I've searched the internet and found nothing of a meteor being reported and am surprised this hasn't been a local media event.;41.1462407329842;-104.807641780105
A huge fireball east of Cheyenne Wyoming;2003-11-01 00:00:00;5 seconds;A huge fireball east of Cheyenne Wyoming My friend and I were outside looking at the stars hopeing to see a ufo or something.  We were facing northeast to watch the sky, but when I turned my head to fix the telescope, a HUGE fireball was streaking through the sky east of us.  I just got the sight for about 5 seconds or so.  My friend didn't see anything because he was right next to the wall. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));41.1462407329842;-104.807641780105
