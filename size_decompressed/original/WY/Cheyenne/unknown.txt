It did not make a sound had no lights and was lower than the jet a third of its hight from my point of view. The shape Icould not make out but it appeared to reflect the city lights and it was travelinga two times the speed of the jet and was not visable in two minutes or less. I am a woodworker I graduated high school and took few collage courses and lived in wyoming most of my life and enjoy our clear star filled nights;41.1462407329842;-104.807641780105

Walking out the front of local hotel resteraunt west of town not 10 feet out the door catch somthing moving fast and low in my peripheral vision and see an object with a brown golden refection of city lights on its bottom side. Tried to point it out to wife but was out of sight qwickly as it headed west it ran out of city lights. It made no sound had no running lights and no glow from either end to look like it had propulsion. It may have been shaped like an I with the top and bottom of the I running paralell to the direction it was heading but Im not for sure that this was its shape. I did notice a passager craft heading east at the same time. It was more directly east of our location.;41.1462407329842;-104.807641780105

The object that was observed appeared to be moving in an easterly direction.  When I first observed this, it was glowing orange with a very short tail behind it.  The object then had smaller glowing pieces coming off of it.  This lasted for approx-imately  three seconds. The glowing object then went out and reappeared for 2 seconds.  It seemed odd because of the slow speed that it was moving at.  If I had to guess on the speed of the object, I would say less than 5000 mph. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date in December 2005 is approximate.  Re-entering space debris usually is visible for more than just a few seconds.
