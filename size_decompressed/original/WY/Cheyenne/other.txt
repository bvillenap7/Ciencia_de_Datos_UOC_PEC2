I have photographed two comets.Spend many hours observing sky. this night i was setting on a bench with my dog Buddy looking at the clear night stars and jupiter,listening to baseball game on radio when a noticed what apeared to be a comet to the south headed north. It looked as if it was moving at satelight speed. I  know comets dont move like this but that is what it looked like. ASs it moved to the north the tail begain to fade to nothing.;41.1462407329842;-104.807641780105
Looked like the sun or moon.;2001-08-17 20:30:00;4 minutes;Looked like the sun or moon. Looked like the sun,heading west in the sky.  When it got furter out it started to look like an eye ball shape.  Then it disappeared. The object was an orange color. Lite up the sky like the sun was setting.  The sun had already had set by then.  My negihbor spotted it first and came and got me and said Do you believe in ufo's? I repiled yes. My neighbor said that the object had a piece of something from it broke off in the sky which shot up in the sky. We watched it through bichourlers.;41.1462407329842;-104.807641780105
Green Streaking Object;2004-03-19 23:15:00;2-3 Seconds;Green Streaking Object I dont know if this qualifies as a UFO sighting or not.  But I was on my way to work about half an hour ago and saw a large very bright green object streak across the sky leaving a trail of green behind it.  At first I thought it was maybe fireworks but realized that it was very high and going from the South to the North at a downward angle.  I have seen meteors and such before but they didnt have the briliant bright green glow.  I saw all this about 5 miles North of the city of Cheyenne, WY.;41.1462407329842;-104.807641780105
Two pulsating large yellow-white lights with bulbous and tall center between lights;2010-08-06 00:30:00;5 minutes;August 26, 2010- Cheyenne WY- at 0030am   Object came from SE, moving NE.  Fairly low in sky.  Two pulsating large yellow-white lights with bulbous and tall center between lights.  Center could be seen under light of full moon.  Center looked like a flat, rusty metal color, but I could only see this for approx 10 seconds.   Myself and two others watched object travel and had visual of it for approximately 5-6 minutes.  There was no noise associated with object travel.;41.1462407329842;-104.807641780105
Taking a smoke break in front of my house, was watching a satellite traveling east to west, looked in south/south east direction and im;2016-09-10 21:25:00;1-2 minutes;Taking a smoke break in front of my house, was watching a satellite traveling east to west, looked in south/south east direction and immediately noticed two very large red unflashing/unblinking red lights, within a second I noticed a large vertical structure coming from the between the two lights that was dimly lit with a creamy white color.  Structure coming from the top looked tall and thin.  My first thought was a Chinese lantern, but object was very low and very large, traveling fast.  No wind(accuweather said that the wind was 7mph).  Object was traveling North/Northeast.  The large red lights on the bottom seemed to move in relation to the top object.  It did not appear that the red lights were connected to the top structure.  Watched object for about 2 minutes before it was too far away to see.  This object literally flew over the eastern part of the city of Cheyenne, low enough to be a hazard to aircraft.  Was large and bright enough that a lot of people shou! ld have seen it.  The two red lights on the structure were like looking at tail lights on a car. Very large, not the near pinpoint FAA lights that you would see on an aircraft.  No sound coming from craft at all. It appeared that the object was less than a mile from me, but distance is a tough thing to judge.   This happened less than an hour ago, still fresh in memory.;41.1462407329842;-104.807641780105
Cloud-seeding irregular movement object seen near F.E.Warren AFB Cheyenne WY;2020-09-02 19:39:00;70 minutes;Cloud-seeding irregular movement object seen near F.E.Warren AFB Cheyenne WY At approximately 7:39 p.m., Wednesday, September 2nd, 2020, my partner Marcia and I walked the newly completed asphalt loop in a new subdivision (Saddle Ridge) development in East Cheyenne, WY.  I wanted to stall our walk on the North-Eastern corner to get her a better background as the sun would be dropping below the horizon and gives an incredible view. As we walked up and down the northern stretch gathering panoramic and regular still images of the skyline, I noticed a peculiar shape that did not align naturally and drew my eye to it.  After I thought I lost it behind the moving clouds, Marcia, a sheriff‘s deputy here in Laramie County, still had eyes on it and helped me reacquire it. At that point, I was able to capture it on my iPhone with some not so flattering commentary. As we walked home, it started to move and was what I thought was something slowly crashing through the atmosphere, and we could witness breaking up into smaller pieces like the shape of salmon steak and much more brightly reflective than the more massive body which started to thin, and the wind revealed it to be a formed cloud. I decided to not waste time walking the rest of the loop and cut through the undeveloped land full of live tumbleweeds in sandals just to hurry and grab my pair of Nikon Aculon A211 10x22x50 binoculars to help determine what we were watching. I called my parents, who reside an hour north of me (Fort Laramie), and see if they could see anything or not. They could not, so I sent her some images trying to show what we were witnessing while trying to talk through what it possibly could be. Marcia and I continued to talk with my mother on the phone and pass the binoculars back and forth as we watched this object seed clouds in little lines and change angles, descend and ascend while hovering above a wind farm and turbines we have out in the West/Southwest or eight o’clock with proper North orientation. I had purchased an adapter for the binoculars that I could also use on a telescope and spotting scope come this hunting season and allow me to attach my iPhone to and capture images by magnification. Remembering I had it is a box from my recent move, I left the road in front of my house to quickly grab it to prove what we couldn’t describe. By the time I found the bracket adapter and made it outside, Marcia had lost it, and I swept the last known location, and I too could not locate any further trace.;41.1462407329842;-104.807641780105
