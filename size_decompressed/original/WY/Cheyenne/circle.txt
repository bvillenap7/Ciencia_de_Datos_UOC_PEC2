followed by flying silent vehical for 45 minutes in wyomming;1970-06-20 02:00:00;45 minutes;followed by flying silent vehical for 45 minutes in wyomming   I have been wanting to report this incident for almost 40 years now.  It occurred while my friend and I were traveling from our school in North Dakota to California where he was to be married.  To the best of our recollection, on or about June 20th, 1970, we were passing through Wyomming driving through to Colorado late at night in his Volkswaggen Beetle.  To the best of our estimates, we were proceding south on I-87 about 100 miles north of Cheyenne.  It was very dark and there was little or not traffic on the road and no houses, buildings etc as we drove, very desolate. It was my shift driving and I noticed a lighted craft immediately in front keeping pace with the car and passing from my right to the left.  It caught my attention because it appeared to be traveling with the car.  Approximately 10 minutes after that I again noticed what appeared to be a similar lighted craft again passing from left to right the same distance from the car at the same hightg and again appearing to keep pace with the car.  My friend was sleeping at this time and I did not wake him until about 10 minutes later when I again saw what appeared to be the identical lighted craft in the same position. I told my friend what I had been observing and that I thought that this craft appeared to be following the car.  We decided to stop the car and got out to better observe.  The craft then passed directly above us and hovered maybe 500 feet above us.  We heard no noise whatsoever. It was a very clear night with no clouds etc.  As we watched the craft turned out its lights and we then became quite scared feeling that it was watching us and might mean us some harm.  We jumped into the car and started down the road and at that point the entire car lit up.  That was the end of the event as we remember it and did not see the craft again. I have thought about this incident many times and after hearing of similar stories have wondered if there was any connection to some unusual objects that have worked there was from my body including a Â¼ inch piece of crystal that came out of my right index finger many years ago.  About three years later an identical piece of crystal came out of my gum. ((NUFORC Note:  Source indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));41.1462407329842;-104.807641780105
8/5/11 I observed five round brightly colored objects moving sw to ne quietly at great speed.;2011-08-05 18:13:00;15 to 20 min.;8/5/11 I observed five round brightly colored objects moving sw to ne quietly at great speed. On August 5, 2011, at about 18:10 to 18:15 MDT I was facing east (nearly 90 degrees true).  I just happened to be looking for the Moon which I observed south (nearly 180 true) when I observed two objects approximately 3 degrees east of the Moon and the same south.  They were moving at about a course of (nearly 15 true).  The first seemed to be moving ahead a little faster and opening the distance between them that I adjudged to be several degrees at first. They appeared to have some color in the setting sun.  I watched them as they continued to separate a little and then slowly veer to the east to a heading between 15 true and maybe 45 true.  As they now moved away from me the appeared closer together, that is less separation. Shortly another object appeared from the same location, so I went to get binoculars.  With the binoculars I could not resolve anything but a ball like object.  That is no wings.  The third object had bright red markings and some black. The fourth object appeared out of the same location and followed the same path except these seemed not to veer off to the east as much.  The forth object was a brilliant green, and could only be resolved to be round.  The fifth object seemed to be as the first three bright red with some markings. Since I had only a 45 degree field of view, blocked by a tree, my estimates of speed and altitudes are just that, estimates.  Speed I adjudge to be greater that mach 1.  I first thought greater that 500 nm.  Altitude I adjudge to have been greater than 50,000 ft. There was no sonic boom.  There was no sound of propulsion system. My wife observed the first two, but says she thought them planes. I have a message about this on Facebook, but no one else has reported seeing them.;41.1462407329842;-104.807641780105

And this round object, with bunch of mini pastel lights floating around in side of the round object.  And the round object was clear see through.  It flu or glided pretty fast.   About 1 min later another one glides past but this one appeared to have a tail looked more like a ballon.  clear round and floating mini pastels lights inside of it, and this is night and dark. ((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken via telephone with the witness, and she assures us that the sighting occurred at 4:45 p.m., as she was returning home from work.  The objects were seen moving from her right to left, but she witnessed GREEN lights, ruling out any type of terrestrial aircraft.  PD));41.1462407329842;-104.807641780105
