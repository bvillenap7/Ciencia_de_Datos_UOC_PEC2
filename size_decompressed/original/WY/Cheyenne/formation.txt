At first it looked like a cluster of stars.  But once we really looked, it was like six little lights, all floating really close together.  Way too bright to be stars.   We live on south House, and it was so bright it lit up the whole backyard. ((NUFORC Note:  We have sent an e-mail to the source of the report, to make sure that the time indicated above is correct.

Multi colored lights over northern Cheyenne.  ((anonymous report));2018-09-02 22:20:00;10 minutes;Multi colored lights over northern Cheyenne. 2 horizontal rows of multi colored lights observed over northern Cheyenne.  Lights were consistently lit, my son I thought we were seeing the lights on Air plane wings, however we never saw them move, flash or change angle as it would be the case in any moving plane.  Never heard a noise.  The lights were too many to be from a normal Air craft and varied in color.  As my son and I were watching them, they just disappeared, turned off as if someone had just flipped a switch.  We could not see a body of an aircraft or hear anything.
