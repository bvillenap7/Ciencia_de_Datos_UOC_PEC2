Object under tarp A traveling co-worker of mine described this strange site to me. First, He noticed the black Huey w/ no markings on it very low to the ground a little ways off the highway. Then, on the Highway Just behind it, was a convoy of two(2) Humvees w/soldiers(?) in all black uniforms w/m-16's traveling just ahead of a tractor trailer flatbed. On this flatbed was an object covered by a tarp, which was flapping in the wind. Enough so that from his vantage point, He could see a round object with winglets sticking out off of the side of it. These He estimated to be about four (4)ft.long. Length or dia. was estimated at 8-9 ft. Metallic in color. Truck was followed by two(2) more Humvees of same Description as front two. A ways back (mile?)there were several County Sheriffs in Chevy Suburbans traveling in same direction. This all took place near Cheyenne Mountain on a desolate Highway on a cold,clear morning. Direction of convoy was either Northerly or Eastern.*NOTE* This event  took place the same weekend as Mass UFO sightings were reported over northern Colorado according to MUFON CO. State Section Director on Art Bell's Radio Show. ((NUFORC NOTE:  The author of this report indicates that the alleged sighting occurred near Cheyenne Mountain near Cheyenne, Wyoming.  Cheyenne Mountain is located at Petersen AFB near Colorado Springs, Colorado.  Since the information is a second hand report, there may be some confusion on the part of the author.));41.1462407329842;-104.807641780105
Large teal green orbs in formation.;2018-01-19 19:15:00;5 minutes;Large teal green orbs in formation. I was north of mile marker 22 on I-25, south bound.  Out of the east I saw 2 green orbs that had a large circumference, if I held my fingers up towards my windshield to circle around them there would have been a gap between my index finger and thumb.  There were no strobe lights, only the green orbs and they maintained the same latitude with each other and the same distance was maintained between them and it is my estimation that they were moving about a 125 knots per hour, about the same speed as a small plane such as a Cessna.   It took awhile for them to get to the interstate, cross it and for me to intersect their trajectory.  By the time I was intersecting their trajectory I was in alignment with their westbound direction and I could see one was directly behind the other.  I watched until I couldn't see them anymore.  I reported to my local sheriff.;41.1462407329842;-104.807641780105
