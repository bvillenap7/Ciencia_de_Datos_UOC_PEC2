The craft was white light shaped oval . It moved southeast looking like a plane ,I thought it was a jet liner.We went into the house to get some coffee and when we came back out we looked north in the sky and it wasflying toward us ,with no vapor trail. The craft shone like a star in broad daylihgt and turned around heading north and disapeared from our view.It was stunning!  My friends who watched with me,had a few minutes earlier saw six crafts come together and form a cross. Four of these were silver light, two were red.After forming the cross they dispearsed and flew out of sight. It was a few minutes later we all saw the one I desribed above. My sighting took place at 6:45 May 19th.;41.1462407329842;-104.807641780105
Bright light shooting across the sky;2009-09-23 04:30:00;5 seconds;Bright light shooting across the sky I woke up around 0430 in the morning due to the fact that I couldnt sleep because of the wind blowing outside. I went to look out the window and see how the weather was for the day. It was still pitch black out with a medium overcast outside due to the rain. I couldnt see any stars, just the street light in the distance flickering. All of a sudden I saw a bright light streak across the sky almost as if a shooting star but it was going straight and not downwards. The light looked almost like a rocket shooting across the sky. It was oval shaped and brighter than anything I have ever seen in the sky.It had a short trail behind it, but again nothing like a shooting star. It shot from the North East corner of the sky to the North West. I do live by missle fields, but to my knowledge no nuclear missles have been launched. What in the world did I see? What was it?;41.1462407329842;-104.807641780105
