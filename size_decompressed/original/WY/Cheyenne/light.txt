Star like object over F. E. Warren AFB, WY;1994-06-15 23:45:00;30 Seconds;Star like object over F. E. Warren AFB, WY At this time I was in the USAF and I frequently went to the gym to workout.  The chow hall was open for midnight chow at 2400hrs.  I had finished my workout and was standing outside the chow hall alone waiting for it to open (it was 2345hrs).  The night was extreamly clear and I could see tons of stars.  I am an avid star watcher so this was a great time to just stop and look up.  I noticed an extreamly bright star and stared at it for a moment, then it seemed to move and I looked at it harder and it almost seemed as if it noticed me, im sure that it didn't but the reason I say that is becuase when it moved and I really started to look at it, then it zipped down so fast and as it zipped I thought immediately that it was a shooting star but then then stopped, then it zipped across the sky to the left and I would have to estimate 100 Miles in air space or more within a split second then it stopped again, zipped back to almost the same location only this time higher up and then zipped what appeared to be straight up and then it was gone.  I cannot be sure of the actual distance this object was traveling but I know for a fact that there is no craft that the USAF has that can travel at such speeds and the flight pattern that this craft was making.  Picture an odd shaped triangle it started at the top zipped down then to the left then back up to almost its original position and then poof it was gone.  There were no sounds at all whatsoever.  Now to confirm something.  Where I grew up in California I was lucky to see the SR-71 Blackbird fly many many times.  I saw the SR-71 go sonic and let me tell you that was one fast plane really really fast but there is a catch to speed and that is a Sonic Boom.  When that plane went Mach whatever it did, there was a boom that shook my whole house.  Last note, no pilot could withstand the g-forces that this object would have created to instaniously move the distance and speed this object was traveling at.  This was no slow motion thing zip zip zip gone.  I will never forg! et this and am only reporting it now because I was working with nuclear weapons at the time and could have been considered crazy for reporting such a thing and lost my security clearence.  I made a simple drawing of the pattern of flight if you would like it just let me know and I would be happy to send it. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We will invite the witness to try to pin down the date as accurately as possible.  We have assigned an arbitrary date of June 15, 1994, so that the report sorts to that year.

Light traveled from horizon to horizon in six seconds.  Flashed at ending horizon.;1998-09-02 00:30:00;6 sec;Light traveled from horizon to horizon in six seconds.  Flashed at ending horizon. Witnessed what we thought to be at first a shooting star, but it went too far.  Then we thought it might be a satellite, but it went too fast. It traveled from horizon to horizon, no streaks, no flashes or anything, until the end when it blinked a brighter shade of white.  I thought nothing of it until another sighting a few days later (Sept 4).  I have made another report for this sighting.;41.1462407329842;-104.807641780105

It sat in the sky for about two minutes, then slowly moves east, then in less then one second it accelerated to EXTREME speed and dissapeared. The object was AMAZING in brilliant neon colors that changed VERY QUICKLY ! ... There were no engine sounds at all. The object was very bright and did not appear to be a craft from earth. I got a warm feeling inside when i saw the craft, as though they were here to let me know i'm not alone ... WE'RE NOT ALONE.;41.1462407329842;-104.807641780105
Slow moving, silent,  bright light travels over Cheyenne WY;2010-04-29 20:45:00;7 minutes;Slow moving, silent,  bright light travels over Cheyenne WY Single light came out of the southwest moving northeast. Very bright light, constant and did not radiate much beyond object(?). Unable to see shape.  Color: white/pale yellow. Size comparable to the headllights would see on a very low flying helecopter at night if it was coming directly at you. The quality of this light did not change the entire time we watched. Height of this light was about twice that which you would expect to see a helecopter flying over the city (we have air natl guard & their practice flights are usually fairly 'low'). This light traveled silently and slowly. From the time it traveled from 'in front of us', to where we could no longer see it at all, was approx 5-7 minutes.;41.1462407329842;-104.807641780105
U.F.O in Cheyenne, Wyoming;2010-10-15 02:30:00;15 minutes;U.F.O in Cheyenne, Wyoming As I stepped out on my porch facing towards the west, to have a smoke, I was observing towards the north-west across the parking lot of a grocery store. I noticed what I thought was a star,low but motionless, flickering brilliant colors of green, blue and white. In awww, I stayed focused on this star. My opinion changed once I noticed this light was swaying slowly back and forth, low enough to be obscurred by the parking lot's lamp post. I felt as if it knew I could see it, because as I would follow it, it would move slowly back behind the lamp post's cover at an angle that I would have to change constantly to keep spotting it. I thought for a second, I really need somebody else to see this with me, I stepped back in, ran up the stairs and awoke my girlfriend in panic to go see. She got up, got dressed and came out. I pointed at it and it was in the same little area I spotted it at, low but dead still. She seemed sort of mad because it could easily be mi! staken as a star. I told her to focus on it and after a minute of watching this thing it surely started moving slowly back and forth again. I asked what she thought about it and she replied sort of confused. She then said, look it moved more towards the right, then instantly this light stopped in place, lifted a little and then completely disappeared. She asked Did it just disappear? I didn't know what to say, I wanted to think it didn't disappear but it did and I felt like falling over literally. What I had seen wasn't man-made at all because of its behavior. The flickering of the lights of green, blue and white and sometimes dimming for a second, to its motionless sway and it's elusive movements from my view. It layed low in altitude probably about 800 ft in the air, and out about 5 or 6 miles from our point of location. Thankfully I had my girlfriend as witness to this marvelous but mind boggling event, because if I had seen it alone, I would of probably went mad. ! I am hoping that there was somebody else in town or out in tha! t area, witnessing this light. It has left me sort of paranoid and just weirded out.;41.1462407329842;-104.807641780105
2 groups of lights rapidly moving north over Cheyenne Wy;2011-04-01 21:10:00;5 seconds;2 groups of lights rapidly moving north over Cheyenne Wy Friday, April 1 2011 at. 21:10 while my wife and I were sitting outside we saw several points of light moving across the sky.  There were two separate groups of 3 to 4 lights each moving parallel to each other directly north.  One of the lights from the group on the left moved diagonally and met and continued to move with the right group.  The time from when they caught our eye until they became to faint to see was only seconds.  They were moving extremely fast, we initially saw them basically straight above us and then they disappeared to the north.  We did not hear any noise associated with them, nothing obscured our view and the lights were not flashing or colored.  In the area tonight the Air National Guard is flying at least 2 C1-30s, which is pretty common here.  They were not around when we saw the lights.;41.1462407329842;-104.807641780105
Blueish purple light that zig-zagged across the night sky.;2015-05-28 21:00:00;2 minutes;Blueish purple light that zig-zagged across the night sky. I seen a blueish purple light moving south to north very rapidly.  It stopped and went south again before turning east for a mile.  It changed color to orange/white as it came east.  It then turned and went west changing color back to blue/purple and covering 2 to 3 miles in a matter of 2 seconds.  It came back a minute later and did some of the same manuvers zig zaging across the night sky and disappeared again going west.  It was located over Interstate-25 in south west Cheyenne. ((NUFORC Note:  For some reason, witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));41.1462407329842;-104.807641780105
Stationary lights that looked like a sideways no. 8.;2018-02-16 01:15:00;2 hours;Stationary lights that looked like a sideways no. 8 My husband and I went in our back yard on February 15. 2018, to smoke a cigarette.  It was 23:15 hours and our back yard faces southeast. I noticed an unusually bright star in the sky and showed my husband. He noticed that it didn’t blink like the other stars do.  It was very windy and clear that night. Later on (back in the house), I grabbed binoculars and looked at it again before I went to bed. That was around 00:30 hrs. The star was in the same position as earlier and through the binoculars it looked like 2 stars very close together. I told my husband I believe the star seems so bright because it is just two stars very close together. We left it at that and went to bed. The next night ( February 16) we came home from the late movies and went in the back yard to smoke. It was 01:10 in the morning and we immediately spotted the bright star in the exact same place as the night before. This time I took a picture with my I phone 6 and then decided to zoom in on it ( in video mode) to see if I could get a better look at it that way. When I zoomed in and started filming I saw that it was two lights very close together. They were both round and reminded me of headlights of a car but like I said before, very close together. In fact they were so close to each other I could not see where one ended and the other one started. It looked in shape like a sideways number 8 shape, made of two bright lights that touch each other. What I saw made me quiet unsure because neither me nor my husband had an immediate explanation for that “thing”. What we do know for sure is that it was about at least 5 miles away from us and a couple thousand feet high in the air. We live in a new built area with not much around us yet so we’re sure that it was no lights from anything on the ground. Also, my husband who is active Air Force is very good at estimating distances. (This is because he was a weapon instructor for 8 years and is used to estimating distances due to that job.) We are not the kind of people to jump to conclusions but the sighting left us both with the wish for a rational explanation. Also not being able to explain the sighting left me so antsy that night that I could not go to sleep until after 02:30 in the morning. I checked one last time around 02:30 hrs to see if that “star” was still there and it was, again in the very same position as before ( and the night before). On both nights that we saw it, it seemed stationary in the sky. Neither one of us ever saw it move. Lastly I wanna say that we both had not been drinking any alcohol. We were absolutely sober on both nights. We are very rational people and that’s why we’d welcome a logical explanation for what we saw. Please let us know what you make of this. Thank you !;41.1462407329842;-104.807641780105

25 strange lights passed over cheyenne, 7 witnesses.  ((Starlink satellites));2020-03-25 21:00:00;25;25 strange lights passed over cheyenne, 7 witnesses A family member in town called me, and myself and my mom went out to look.  I also called my sister and her 3 kids to look.  They were all lights, similar in size and brightness to stars.  All started in the southwest and headed exactly straight northeast.   No blinking,  no sound, too high for drones, too fast for helicopters or satellites.   Some were in a horizontal row of two or three moving in unison.   Others flowed very closely behind others.  Not anything I can explain.;41.1462407329842;-104.807641780105
