V shaped craft moving north to south with seven round lights.;2008-09-26 23:25:00;3 seconds;V shaped craft moving north to south with seven round lights. On Friday evening at approximately 23:25 hrs, my twelve-year old son and I were getting ready to have a sleep-out on the back porch of our home.  All lights were out and we were scanning the sky for satellites and falling stars when an object appeared over our heads moving north to south.  The object appeared to be very high and very large.  It was either one craft in a triangle form with three dim lights up each side and one at the point (seven total), or it was seven separate craft flying in a V formation. The latter may be more plausible because I am pretty sure that I could see through the craft.  There was no sound associated with this craft and no sonic boom even though it appeared to be moving very fast. The craft was dim and disappeared quickly.;41.1462407329842;-104.807641780105
2 low slow flying black triangles;2010-04-10 21:00:00;minutes;2 low slow flying black triangles I was driving east on Interstate 80 approximately 15 minutes east of Cheyenne Wy when I looked north and saw 2 black wide triangular shaped flying objects.  They were flying low and slow like the slow flying bomber planes. The bright lights from the truck stop on the north side of the road were reflecting on the bottom of the 2 crafts enabling me to see the exact shape of them. They each had a light on each of the three points of the triangle.  One light was red, one was blue and the third looked white or off white. One was following the other and they were flying west along Interstate 80. They were flying slow enough that I was able to watch them for some time and could even see them in my rear view mirror after I couldn't see them out my window any longer. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS) I accidentally entered the wrong date on my report that I just submitted.  It was on 04/10/2010 instead of 04/09/2010;41.1462407329842;-104.807641780105
7/26/14 Cheyenne, WY 11:10pm--Saw 5 lights in the saw in a triangular shape chasing a meteorite with a pinkish hue.;2014-07-26 23:10:00;5 seconds;7/26/14 Cheyenne, WY 11:10pm--Saw 5 lights in the saw in a triangular shape chasing a meteorite with a pinkish hue. I went outside of my apartment complex for a cigarette with my two good friends.  We stood out facing south-southeast.   I looked up first and saw a meteorite with a pinkish hue streaking fairly long across the night sky in a south-eastern direction.   I mentioned this to my friends as they had not seen this event, but roughly 30 seconds later, all three of us saw what looked like a triangular shape of 5 lights in the sky follow the trial of the meteorite that I had seen earlier.  It appeared out of nowhere and slowly followed the path until banking away (rolling, tilting leftwards away from our view) and eventually fading into the black of night.  As if it were following the meteorite curiously.;41.1462407329842;-104.807641780105
Small white triangle-shaped object.;2014-08-16 17:05:00;1 minute;Small white craft, very few medium height clouds on this day,   saw small white triangle shaped object cruising West to East cutting through one of the clouds. S mallish object, thought possible drone.   Thing traveled in perfect straight line, no vapor trail, no noise as it was pretty much straight over head at one point.  Traveled at pretty good pace.   not prop or jet as didn't see how the thing was moving,  it just was cruising- no lights just small white triangle shaped object.;41.1462407329842;-104.807641780105
2 triangular crafts with 3 light blue lights gliding over country side in Cheyenne, WY;2019-03-04 22:08:00;~15 seconds;2 triangular crafts with 3 light blue lights gliding over country side in Cheyenne, WY I was just West of Cheyenne a few minutes after 10 o'clock at night leaving work.  It's out in the country with big open skies and not a lot of lights or people around.  I was driving and looking at the stars.  Perfect night for it, it wasn't bright outside and there were no clouds.  I noticed 3 very soft blue lights in a triangular shape moving in unison, with a black body above it.  These lights were not stars.  Then I noticed a second one.  These lights did not blink. These crafts looked more like they were gliding rather than flying.  At first they were flying in a curve shape, then up, down very quickly.  Then they disappeared.  Definitely not planes or helicopters.  There was no sound.  Don't think they were drones either, these were very large.;41.1462407329842;-104.807641780105
