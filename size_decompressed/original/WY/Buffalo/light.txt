Re-occurring for last month hovering light with 30 min duration, descends below mnt horizon .  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus??  PD));2013-12-09 18:30:00;30 minutes;reoccurring for last month hovering light with 30 min duration, descends below mnt horizon but we can still see its glow over mnt For the last month or so we have seen a bright light over the mountain, South West of Buffalo.  It lasts up to an hour, same time of night but not every night. We have video of it and it is about three finger widths above mountain horizon, then within fifteen min either disappears or goes down until it is below mountain's horizon.  However we can still see the glow of its light coming from the horizon.  There are four witnesses to this. myself, husband, and our two daughters. It can be seen for miles and I believe it to be within our atmosphere, it does move, too fast to be a star or satellite, but also stays in the same place for the majority of its appearance. It dims and come back as well as descends.  It has no flashing lights nor other common aircraft lights. It is too far away to see exactly the lighting but we do see changing colors, blue, green, with white most steady white/yellow headlight-like intensity.;44.354;-106.7098
