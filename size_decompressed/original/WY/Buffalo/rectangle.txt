I witnessed a 5 ft black, tulip shape craft hovering about 30 ft off the ground.  This area is very desolate and at first I thought it was some kind of drone but if it was it would be used for movies as it was very intricate.  I kept driving because it didn't seem possible but I can't stop thinking about it.  This was definitely some kind of craft either the highest tech military craft we have or alien.  It was too small to have a human pilot. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));44.354;-106.7098
