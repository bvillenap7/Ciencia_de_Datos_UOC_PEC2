Large, bright, slow-moving ball in eastern Wyoming.;2015-06-18 22:30:00;10 minutes;Large, bright, slow-moving ball in eastern Wyoming. My adult son and I saw a bright glowing ball of light traveling North to South.  The object made no sound and seemed to be about 5000 ft. or higher.  It made a slight turn to the east and then stopped.   Another light came from the Southwest toward the Northeast same size same brightness for just a few seconds (maybe 30 sec.) and slowly dimmed out.   When we turned back to the first one, it had vanished.  I assume it continued toward Colorado.   When I call the reporting center.  We were cut off when he was the web address?????????;42.0595;-104.1911
One large bright light split into two.;2015-08-01 22:00:00;5 minutes;One large bright light split into two The same two very bright lights were above me and a little bit west.  I thought it was one large bright light, then one separated and slowly traveled towards the northeast.   When I stopped watching, the one headed N.E..  The one that was standing still had gone.  Speed and elevation unknown.  The real time was 9:45 pm but the page would not let me put 21:45pm.  I would not be surprised if they are reported over Alliance, Nebraska, or the Northern Panhandle of Nebraska tonight.   The moving one was four times faster than a satellite and 25 times brighter.   I reported these same two about a month ago.;42.0595;-104.1911
It's back again in the last week by itself.;2015-08-04 22:30:00;3 minutes;It's back again in the last week by Itself. Again only one came from the west and headed North East.  It was just like the others but seemed to be by it's self other than a crossing satellite and large aircraft.   I WOUNDER IF NORAD sees these.  THEY NEVER MAKE ANY SOUND THAT I CAN HEAR.   It has been 4 years since the last big one until this summer.   I ask the ranchers around  NORTHERN Nebraska to watch the sky tonight.;42.0595;-104.1911
Same as last night.  Bright ball of light between 5,000-10,000 feet.  It is 10 times the size of a communication satellite.;2015-08-05 20:25:00;5 minutes;Same as last night.  Bright ball of light between 5,000-10,000 feet.  It is 10 times the size of a communication sat., and several times faster.  It moves without any sound at all.  This one, as well as last night's, event were exactly the same, crossing the North edge of town headed Northeast toward the Nebraska Panhandle I would guess it will be seen between Alliance Nebraska and Chadron Nebraska.   All the craft this summer have been round and not as close to the ground and not even close to being as bright as the CIGAR shaped one I saw 4 or 5 years ago, but they have all been in the summer.   These are similar to what my son saw 4 or 5 years ago on the BIG island of Hawaii that not only terrified him and his hunting buddies but also caused their crazy mean pig hunting dogs that urinated and vomited and left Poop  all over the truck bed.  That one was caught on film the next day on the island of Maui.   P.S.  A large plane was flying the same direction very near each other.  The pilot had to have seen it.;42.0595;-104.1911
