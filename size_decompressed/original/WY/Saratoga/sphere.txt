((HOAX??))  Riding bikes in the desert.  We pulled off of a dirt road and went up into the woods a little ways. ((anonymous report));2016-08-14 16:30:00;20;Me and a friend was riding around out in the desert.  We pulled off of a dirt road and went up into the woods a little ways.  We sit for about 30 minutes as we looked back down the trail, we noticed what we thought was a flashlight getting closer.   We got startled and turned on the headlights, and it dissipated ((sic.  disappeared?)) over a small hill.   We decided we would get out of there quickly, after this happened.   On our way back to town we decided to go to place that over looked town.  From this spot you could see all of town.  All of a sudden, we seen one bright sun colored looking light that split into two difftent orbs.   We turned around and sped toward town to get a better look.  When we topped the hill, you could see town again, and it  dissipred going down the hill....  Then they were both gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible hoax report, we suspect.  Time intended by witness may be 4:30 p.m., and we have changed the time.
