2 dozen flickering lights in perfect triangle formation;2009-05-15 02:00:00;10 seconds;2 dozen flickering lights in perfect triangle formation Sitting in the jacuzzi looking at the stars on a clear night, out of the South a formation appeared doing a slow left turn which brought it right over me. I could see stars thru the formation as it passed over. They were dim flickering and or dancing lights but holding a perfect triangle formation, they also seemed to have some sort of translucent fabric or something flapping around, dimly lit by their lights. They headed North & just kind of faded out. Whole thing lasted maybe 10 seconds, not sure of altitude or speed, did not hear any sound over the jacuzzi noise. I am a long time aircraft & space buff & the owner of a full time aircraft business. Never seen anything like this & have no real idea what it was.;45.0804;-123.5001
