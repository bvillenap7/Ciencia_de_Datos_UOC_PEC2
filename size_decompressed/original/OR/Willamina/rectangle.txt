RAINBOW PHOTO IN OREGON SHOWS TRIANGLE OBJECT IN SKY.;1990-07-12 19:00:00;2 min;RAINBOW PHOTO IN OREGON SHOWS TRIANGLE OBJECT IN SKY. THE FOLLOWING WAS AN EXCERPT FROM THE HAND WRITTEN ACCOUT ON THIS SIGHTING SUBMITTED TO THIS INVESTIGATOR, PHOTO HAS BEEN SENT TO NUFORC IN A PREVIOUS EMAIL.  ON THE AFTERNOON OF JULY 12, 1990,  I NEEDED TO USE THE LAST 2 FRAMES OF A ROLL OF FILM I WANTED TO DEVELOP.  THERE WAS A FULL RAINBOW IN THE SE OVER WILLAMINA LUMBER COMPANYS' MILL.  I TOOK THESE FRAMES FROM MY FRONT PORCH WITH A NIKON 8000 S CAMERA, USING A SIGMA ZOOM LENS, 28-70 MM MAGNIFICATION.  WHEN DEVELOPED, THE NEXT TO THE LAST FRAME HAD WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A DUST PARTICLE ON THE PICTURE. BUT WHEN I CHECKED THE NEGATIVE, IT WAS VISABLE THERE TOO.   ADDITIONAL INFORMATION SENT IN REGARDS TO THIS PHOTO AND SIGHTING FROM THIS INVESTIGATOR.  This is a photo of an unknown object taken about late evening 12 July 1990.  The local farmer I received the photo from was taking a shot of the rainbow.  When he had it developed, the object was noticed. It also shows up in the negative, so it is not from the processing.  It was taken from his front porch, the dark area in the upper right corner is the roof line of his house.  The witness lives on the corner of Ten Bush and Fort Hill Rd. here in Willamina, Oregon.  He is a long time resident here since about 16, he is 72 years of age now. He is an advid photographer.  This object is estimated at about 2000-3000 feet in altitude, at a range of about 1/2 mile to under a mile.  Flight direction looks to be south by southeast.  The lights seen in the bottem of the photograph is the local wood mill here, estimated time was about 7-8pm on the 12th of July.  Witness does not remember anything being in the photograph except the rainbow... it was taken with a 35 mm. camera.  I live right at the top of Oak Lane, so I am familiar with this area...  Currently, the witness is writing his account on the sighting with some additional info on a blue sphere his wife saw in the same area just a few years back.  Most the land around this area is Confederated Tribal Lands of the Grand Ronde ... so it has some interesting history.  I will forward this on your site.  I scanned and enhanced the object.. which is interesting.  The closest military base is a Air Guard  Base, but for the 3 years I have lived in this area, I have never seen any low flying military a/c in the area, except for choppers.  For now this object is unknown as for its orgin, as it does not conform with any conventional commercial or military aircraft I have seen. ((NUFORC Note:  We have not yet received the photograph, to the best of our knowledge.  We have requested that a copy be forwarded to our Center.  PD));45.0804;-123.5001
