Bright light moving erratically, then moving to one spot to disappear. Forest Grove, Oregon, July 20, 2003;2003-07-20 11:00:00;>30 seconds;Bright light moving erratically, then moving to one spot to disappear. Forest Grove, Oregon, July 20, 2003 Clear blue sky.  I am lying on my back on chairs outside a hotel, waiting for people. I noticed a bright light way up in the sky.  I first thought that it was a satellite reflecting the sun.  But then it started to move slowly, erratically, in a small area.  I discarded the idea of statellite.  After more than 15-20 sec., it went on my left at a quicker speed, as a plane would go when in altitude.  It stopped, and disappeared very quickly, as if flying away from earth at a dazzling speed.  That's it.;45.5981;-123.1818
2 erratic flashing lights.;2014-08-08 22:00:00;3 hours;2 erratic flashing lights. Objects in opposite ends of the big dipper stayed in 1 position for an hour then object on the right of the big dipper started moving at a slow pace clock wise and took a higher altitude.   Then object to the left of the big dipper finally moved after hours in the same location and once it moved it moved at an incredible pace.  Flew west towards the coast and out of site within minutes of it moving.   Both objects blinking multiple colors in no particular pattern.  Nor did either object fly in a straight line or in a matter of trying to get to a certain location at a particular time.  Object to the left of the big dipper is now gone and out of site, while the object to the right of the big dipper is still roughly in the same location it started in.   Except for it moved from about a 12 o' clock position to a 2 o' clock position to the NE.;45.5981;-123.1818
Hovering bright light in night sky 3am south of Forest Grove, OR. ((anonymous report));2017-03-19 03:00:00;30 minutes +;Hovering bright light in night sky 3am south of Forest Grove OR Hovering light in distant sky south of Forest Grove, OR.  This is the 3rd occurence I have observed early in the morning (usually around 3am) object meanders about lazily left & right for a good amount of time.  It is very well lit for its size.  Previous sighting included a smaller object directly below with flashing red/green markers.  Object was doing a good job maintaining a position (6 hundred+ est. feet) below the larger lit object.  If brightly lit object moved, then the green/red object would too as if on a long string hanging far below.  Whatever it is it seems as if this is a regular occurence.  Happy hunting ((NUFORC Note:  Source of the report elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
