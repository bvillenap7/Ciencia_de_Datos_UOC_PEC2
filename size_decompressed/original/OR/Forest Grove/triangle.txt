My husband had picked me up from work like usual.  We got out of the car and I looked up at the sky.  It was a crystal clear night so I located Pleiades to point it out to husband since he never knows what I’m talking about when I reference Pleiades.  I point to the cluster and he’s like “That one?”  No, he was looking at the wrong one so he stood against my right shoulder, looking up until he saw where I was pointing.   Suddenly, I see a dim triangle formation moving quickly above us from left to right.  My eyes were trying to comprehend what I was looking at and I yell excitedly at him, “OMG do you see that?!”  He was still looking at Pleiades, but saw it the second it crossed his line of vision.  We watched it as it streaked across the sky, then the 3 dim points shot off at 90 degree angles!  One went left, two went right!  We just turned and looked at each other with our jaws wide open for a second before yelling “wtf did we just see?!;45.5981;-123.1818
