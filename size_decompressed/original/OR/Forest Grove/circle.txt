Upon returning I saw a white light with a blue hue and a smaller green orb attached pass over me.  It continued for another half mile before dissapearing.  The car behind me almost came to a dead stop!  I thought originally it was a trick of the eye's until I called my coworker.  I was informed that he saw it as well and even caught it on his dash cam in his vehicle.  It did not dissipate like a shooting star or comet would usually.  Both of which are not unusual for the area.  Shortly after there was a search helicopter in the area last seen doing circles.  Not long after I returned to my site me and my coworker saw a mysterious white orb floating in the distance for a couple hours fluctuating between brightness before completely disappearing.  It was very strange.  I used to be a huge skeptic until tonight.  Now everything, including any logical explanation of it has changed drastically.  Due to the nature of the work si! te and confidentiality of the client, I cannot release location.  Only general area.;45.5981;-123.1818
