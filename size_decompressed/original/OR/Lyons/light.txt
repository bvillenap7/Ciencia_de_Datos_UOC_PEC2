We are both college educated professional people. We watch the planes fly over most nights as we sit out on our porch This object was not travelling in the usual flight path. It was difficult to judge how high or far away it was. We were looking towards the NE skyline. This is the second time that one of us has seen a strange light hover & dissapear but as both of us witnessed it this time we thought we would report it.;44.7499;-122.595
