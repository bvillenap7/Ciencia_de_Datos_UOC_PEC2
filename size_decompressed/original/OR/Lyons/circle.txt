It was keeping up with us around all the corners and I could physically see it moving up and down, and side to side.  This object followed us all the way to my house in gates, about 15 minutes from Lyons where it first started following. my boyfriend dropped me off and drove home, the object continued to sit outside my house for hours.  I have video footage of the circle light shooting across the sky, moving up and down and disappearing and reappearing, it looks like a light in the sky that burns out and then lights up again.;44.7499;-122.595
