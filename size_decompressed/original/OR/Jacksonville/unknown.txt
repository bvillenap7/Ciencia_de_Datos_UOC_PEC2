Thought it was a planet or star until it started moving in all directions.  Watched for about 10 or 15 minutes then it moved behind the tree line out of sight.  From what i could see it looked almost like a crescent shape, and when it moved i could barely see a wave of whispy greyish/silver in the opposite direction of the movement;42.1845;-123.0212
