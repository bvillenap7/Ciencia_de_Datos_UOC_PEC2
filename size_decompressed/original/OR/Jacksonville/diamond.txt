Single golden diamond shaped object, very fast.;2010-07-12 00:10:00;0:13;Single golden diamond shaped object, very fast. 1 multi-tiered diamond shaped object flew over my house at 12:10 in the morning.  I noticed it outside my window as it flew from the south heading directly north. The object was very fast and had a gold haze around it.   Weather was clear at the time and me and my mom both watched the object for about 3 minutes before we completely lost sight of it. I immediately began looking for a way to report the sighting once I could sort my thoughts.  The experience was very frightening and even caused me to lose my breath for awhile. I do not wear glasses but my mom does, we both clearly saw the object as it passed by very close, she was wearing her glasses at the time as she had just got home from work.
