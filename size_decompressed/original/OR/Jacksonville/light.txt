Multiple satellite looking objects with up to 5 in a row evenly spaced.  ((Spacelink satellites??));2020-02-19 19:00:00;10 minutes;Multiple satellite looking objects with up to 5 in a row evenly spaced Saw what appeared to be satellites moving North.  At first it was 1 every 20-30 seconds.  Later followed by 2 very close together moving in unison and then 5 objects moving in unison and evenly spaced.  All moved in the same direction and many on what appeared to be the exact same path.  Lost count at 18 in the span of 10 minutes.  While the 5 in a row were passing there was a “shooting star” off to the side that was very bright, yellowish with a red aura and tail.;42.1845;-123.0212
