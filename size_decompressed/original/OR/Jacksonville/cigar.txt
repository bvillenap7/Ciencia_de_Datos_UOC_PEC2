Cigar shaped slightly illuminated object moving North-NorthEast.;2021-05-15 22:35:00;1 min. 30 sec;Cigar shaped slightly illuminated object moving North-NorthEast. Upon stepping out from my hotel room and walking the 75'  or so feet to an area outside close to street. that I tend to smoke while I'm staying here, I looked up to North to check weather (clouds?) like I often do and immediately saw a slightly illuminated slightly hazy, long object moving that I first thought appeared like a comet with tail but realized shape was consistent end to end a cigar shape for lack of more specific description.   Slightly tapered on end closest to me.  And same taper it seemed at other end.  Moving consistent speed.  I thought, well, that's probably a plane lining up for Medford Airport but as it traveled slightly North-NorthEast at a consistent speed, there was never a single light  blinking or otherwise as with an airplane.  Nor shape of a tail or wings.  And since I live in an area close to an airport, I have never seen a plane in a clear sky without a single light flashing at some point.   And it almost appeared that the illumination might have been from the city lights of the Rogue Valley cities below and to East of object.  Maybe not.  The entire sighting was 1 and 1/2 minutes tops at 10:35pm.    Clear sky, some stars visible although there was immediate light pollution in area.  Object elevation?   Hard to say.  Perhaps 7 to 10,000ft?   If so, object would have been several hundred feet long.  At least a couple hundred.   No apparent change of course.   Haven't quite seen anything like it although it was subtle and not at all clearly visible.;42.1845;-123.0212
