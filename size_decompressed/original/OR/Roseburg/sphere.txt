Silvery sphere observed flying in a non-linear path I'm convinced it was a UFO.;2007-09-15 13:00:00;20 sec;Silvery sphere observed flying in a non-linear path I'm convinced it was a UFO. I was startled to hear a report of a UFO sighting that happened in September in Albany Oregon.  The sighting that I had was during mid day on a very bright sunny day.  The silvery (mercury like) single colored object was traveling from the SW to the NE in a non-linear path.  From almost overhead I followed it to a place fairly well before the horizon.  It was a single object that took about 20 seconds to disappear into the sky.  My first inclination was that it was a balloon, but following it fairly high in the sky I was positive that it was not.  I would guess the elevation to be 10,000 feet or below.  It did not leave a con-trail and did not resemble anything that I had seen before in my 46 years of life.  The path was not an ordinary North - South commercial jet flight path.  When I saw it, I was very awe struck so much so that I remarked to my wife just moments after it dissappeared that I had just witnessed my first UFO.  I'm not one to be fanatical about such things but am now convinced that I did see a UFO. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

crazy ball of light!;2009-04-26 22:00:00;30 seconds;crazy ball of light! I'm 21 years old. i don't do drugs, and rarely drink. i was fully sober at the time of the siteing. my father was whiteness as well. it was very clear out, not a cloud in the sky. i was standing in my back yard, smoking a cigarette. i noticed a bright moving object. it had no distinct shape other than it was comparable to a huge star. about 5 times the size of the north star, and was lit the same too. it had an orange red huge to it. it moved across the sky from southeast to northwest. it looked as if it was in the outermost part of the atmosphere. i know what satellites looks like, and i've seen many shooting stars. it was really fast but much slower than a shooting star.  it moved in a striate line for about 10 seconds then broke angle more to the north. it remained in site for about 10  more seconds, and then came to a complete abrupt stop. it lingered for a few more seconds, and then appeared to flicker out in a pulsating way. at no time did the object appear to trail or change shape. the object covered about 2/3 of the skyline, but never broke either one.;43.2289254237289;-123.293894915256
Saw large chrome ball flying in the night sky, and uncle claims to have seen it 3 times in Mexico.;2019-12-16 05:00:00;5 minutes;Saw large chrome ball flying in the night sky, and uncle claims to have seen it 3 times in Mexico. I was on my way to work at the lumber mill, in Oregon.  It was December, about 5AM in the morning.  Coming up the road towards the mill, I looked up at the clear night sky and saw what appeared to be a large chrome ball. There were no lights on it, but the chrome seemed to be light itself, however, the air around it didn't have a glowing haze or anything.  It's hard to describe. I could see it was slowly following the river across the highway, near the mill. I slowed to a stop to watch it.  It moved awfully slow and I was taking in the detail.  It really looked like chrome, and I saw no windows.  It seemed to be about the size of a pickup truck.  It kept going until some tree obscured my vision, and I started to drive up the driveway to work. I was in awe of what I saw. It didn't occur to me to grab my phone to snap a picture, however, I have a cheap phone with a bad camera, and the photo wouldn't have come out in the night sky. The mill is a large complex a! nd has many tall lights.  It seems the object may have been inspecting the mill, perhaps trying to discover what it was.  I discussed this with my uncle who was a Green Beret in Vietnam, and who did 27 years in special Forces.  He told me he has seen the chrome ball 3 times in Mexico, and one flying saucer about 30 feet above his head.  He also claims that some “men in black” showed up to his house in Mexico, while he was away, and the neighbors told him about it.  When he retired, my uncle lived in a house on the beach in central Mexico.;43.2289254237289;-123.293894915256
At approximately 22:00 hrs. There were a line of satellite like objects passing overhead from the W to NW.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-17 22:00:00;30 minutes;At approximately 22:00 hrs. There were a line of satellite like objects passing overhead from the west to northwest direction white lights one after another. There were two side by side two separate times then one about every 30 seconds for approximately 10 objects then spaced out to 3 to 4 minutes for the remainder of them.Not sure of the 28 to 30 objects as I went in the house to get my witness. I continued to watch until the last smaller and less bright object pasted overhead as it did off to the left side of it two very bright flashes occurred and that was it.;43.2289254237289;-123.293894915256
