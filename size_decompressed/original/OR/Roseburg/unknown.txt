Large object travelling North. 2 Large Yellowish Bright lights and other lights on object. NO SOUND. Alt. <2000 feet, vel. <100mph;2001-03-13 22:00:00;10 minutes;Large object travelling North. 2 Large Yellowish Bright lights and other lights on object. NO SOUND. Alt. <2000 feet, vel. <100mph My second Major sighting in this county since sept. 1997 Very large object passing directly overhead and slightly to my east.  2 LARGE and BRIGHT yellowish lights (steady)  visible as well as a couple other dimmer blinking (unsure but seem to recall red or green perhaps).   Object was well within 2000 feet altitude and made absolutely no sound travelling due north at slow speed, <100 mph est. perhaps half that.  Total spread of lights at least as large as apparent full moon, appeared to be one craft.  I was trying to convince myself it had to be a plane, but after a minute or so I realized ANY local terrestrial traffic would be plainly audible at this range!   Also I suspect there may have been other lights on the east side of craft not visible to me.   Had to make this report as it appears others north of me had possibly seen same object.   NOTE: very uncertain of exact time of event but certainly waas after 9pm local and before midnight.  We have a HOTSPOT of sorts here in SW Oregon.  KEEP LOOKING UP FOLKS,  THE BIZZARE IS THERE!!! ((NUFORC Note:  Please see reports from Puget Sound, and other areas, for this time and date.  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));43.2289254237289;-123.293894915256

I have a Samsung Galaxy S 3 phone.   I zoomed in to get a closer look, and noticed two to three planet like objects around the moon.  One was a redish color, one was a greenish color, and the one I could not make out the color.  They moved around the moon.;43.2289254237289;-123.293894915256
