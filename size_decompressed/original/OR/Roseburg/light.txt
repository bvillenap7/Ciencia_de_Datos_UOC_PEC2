Light bouncing around a valley. Light changes intensity, brightness, and color.  Disappears, reappears different location.;1997-09-09 21:30:00;2 hours;Light bouncing around a valley. Light changes intensity, brightness, and color.  Disappears, reappears different location. On 9/9/97 at about 9:30 p.m., a friend and myself were watching the most severe thunderstorm to hit our area that summer. Shortly into our weather session, my friend says, hey, do you see that?.  I looked where he was pointing.  The object was zipping into this valley about 5 miles away to our wnw.  We were located about 10 miles nw of Roseburg OR., USA. The object would be real dim, then brighten intensly, brighter than Venus, but pulsing also, sometimes every color of the rainbow, it seemed.  At one point, the light went down out of sight, then a pause, then it came shooting up out of the valley like a squiggly glowing red sperm, then disappear. Then it would reappear from somewhere else, moving a different direction. Keep in mind, a pretty violent thunderstorm is blasting lightning down, rather close to us at times.  This object was below the cloud deck. At one point it appeared to come very close to us, I swear, I could makeout some sort of lighted window panes, with a darker one in between. I assumed the object was close at that point, possibly within a few hundred yards.  In any case it must have been rather small, perhaps less than 15 meters in size. Well, this went on for about 1.5 hours and we simply weren't watching the lightning anymore, we didn't even care that it was getting within 10 miles of us. Ok your thinking, ball lightning right. No.  I would have settled for that, but then something remarkable happened. my friend was looking around for the onject to reappear somewhere else, like it was doing, then I saw it, a perfect white cone of light beaming accross the bottom of the thunderclouds.  There was very little thunder, and no rain at our location, and we could hear no aircraft of any kind. This spotlight came from the object, which had reappeared again. I yelled to my friend, but it disappeared just then.  It happened again, and we both saw it. This time, the object was near us and it beamed that perfect white light right above our heads about 100 feet and scanned the hillside right behind us. I have been an amateur astronomer and weather observer for well over 15 years, and I have never witnessed an event like this, in fact I have to say, it has been the most troubling event in my life. I also want to point out, at one time it appeared that the one object went into the valley, then came out with another one attached by, energy Something strange out there, and I think these strong storms have an adverse affect on them.;43.2289254237289;-123.293894915256

Amber/Orange lights evenly spaced in a line moved north quickly and disappeared in the clouds;2011-11-24 18:25:00;5 minutes;Amber / Orange lights evenly spaced in a line moved north quickly and disappeared in the clouds My mother had just returned home and she burst into the house yelling, Come outside and see the lights!  She sounded nervous and excited.  She ran outside and pointed out 5 lights that were moving quickly north.  My mom said that when she was driving, there were at least twice as many lights, arranged in two groups.  One group was arrayed in a wedge shape, and the other was in a line.  She had tried calling us on her cell phone, but she couldn’t find it in the car.  She saw a man that had pulled over at a nearby intersection who had gotten out of his car to watch the lights. The remaining lights were all in a north-south line, more or less evenly spaced.  The lights were a strange amber / orange color, unlike any we had ever seen on an aircraft.  The lights did not blink, they remained a constant glow.  One by one the lights flew north rapidly and disappeared into cloud banks.  We couldn’t hear any noise from the lights. It was dark with a high cloud cover and intermittent showers;43.2289254237289;-123.293894915256

At approx 9:55 pm pacific time, I saw 3 very bright orange lights forming the shape of a triangle. They were stationary for around a minute, then two of them took off.  The last one moved for a few secods, stopped, then slowly left in the same direction as the others.  The lights appeared to be round. I could see stars in between them.;43.2289254237289;-123.293894915256

It proceeded up for 15-20 degrees stalled at this position got dimmer turned left headed east approximately 2 degrees dimmed more and headed back toward horizon faded to nothing well before hitting the horizon. Wife brought to my attention later the distressed horse in the field below during the whole scene.  Horse was silent before and after this event.

Bright light come over horizon, turn and disappear.;2012-07-13 21:30:00;60 seconds;Bright light come over horizon, turn and disappear. Friday, July 13, 2012 Noticed the neighbor’s horse started making noise while my husband & I were having dinner on our deck.  Caught out of the corner of my eye a bright object coming over the horizon (I was facing south).  It was bright orange with a red spot behind it.  Very large and bright, moving slow, rising at a 30 degree angle or so.  Seemed to stop and then turn toward us, which is toward the left (eastwardly) then started heading back toward the horizon.  Once it started turning the light started dimming quickly, and completely went out before reaching the horizon.  The lights were solid, no flashing and the red disappeared light disappeared at the turning point.   This lasted for about 1 minute.  Once lights disappeared the neighbor’s horse went silent.  The sky was clear and hadn’t noticed any stars yet.  Probably about 9:30pm.  The horizon is not far from us, about two miles. We sit out quite often and watch the sky.  Watched many planes at night, but none like this before.;43.2289254237289;-123.293894915256

Then at 21:30 hours, two lights just appeared above Roseburg, at about 10,000 feet, then the lights went out a minute later they came on and we're moving slow then they went out again then they came on and moved North West and disappeared at about 21:35 hours.;43.2289254237289;-123.293894915256
My wife and I were sitting out looking at the stars, when a flashing light appeared, E of the Little Dipper. ((anonymous report));2019-08-27 21:09:00;20 seconds;AT 21:09 on Aug. 27, 2109, my wife and I were sitting out looking at the stars and sky when a flashing light appeared, generally east of the Little Dipper from where we live in Roseburg, Oregon.  The light was what looked like at the same height as the stars or as brightness goes, as we saw it, a little brighter than how the stars appeared.  It then began to move in a western direction at a kinda of wobbly path.  We would see the light for 3 or 4 seconds and then not see it then it would show up and flash again just a little bit further from the first flash and did this (appear and reappear at different spots along its route west) 4 to 5 times before the flashing stopped and we could no longer see the light at all.  The entire sighting took maybe 20 seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));43.2289254237289;-123.293894915256
