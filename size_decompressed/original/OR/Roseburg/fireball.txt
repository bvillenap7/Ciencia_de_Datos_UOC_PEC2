Bright yellow ball with abrupt movement;2004-11-04 19:15:00;1 minute plus;Bright yellow ball with abrupt movement While my husband, who is a retired ((deleted)). technician, and myself, a medical ((deleted)), were sitting in our spa outside at about 1915 on 11/04/04 we saw a very large bright yellow circular object in the eastern sky that flew down rapidly for about 30 seconds after we had spotted it.  The bright yellow went dimmer, and then we could see some red lights on the outer edge.  It then went brighter, and then the bright yellow disappeared for a second or so.  It then came back and stayed for about 10 seconds. It then made a 90-degree abrupt turn towards the north.;43.2289254237289;-123.293894915256

I took a picture for proof.  As soon as I did two of them took off to the west.  The third which was trailing behind also turned to the west.  There was no sound at all.  Can you explain this?;43.2289254237289;-123.293894915256
Orange lights west of Roseburg.;2016-02-03 02:10:00;2 minutes;orange lights west of roseburg I went out for a smoke and saw four lights orange in color that where west of roseburg in a straight line from top to bottom then moved to a square formation 2 of the objects dropped below sight, and as they did seemed to rotate so that the light from them got stronger and dimmer.   Then, the other two got very close and almost seemed to become one, then one rose up and headed northerly and disappeared the last object held its place for at least 30 seconds then began to descend as the first two had with its light rotating until it as well disappeared.
