It was pitch black and all of a sudden there was this blinding white light that enveloped the car and I remember being terrified.   The next thing I know we are down the road a good 4 or 5 miles from the plant, I don't remember how we got there, but now we are at the old Oak St bridge.  Anyone from that area should remember that old metal bridge, we were going so fast across it we were fishtailing, it had been raining.  I know we were both terrified and I looked up at the sky and there were 3 or 4 of them following us all the way thru town.   We finally got to my Aunt & Uncle's house where we were staying the night, I remember being so afraid to look up in the sky, but as we ran into the house I saw them go zip, zip, zip and they were gone.  I don't know how else to describe it. Once inside the house, we immediately started telling the other adults there what we had seen.  Of course we were met with jokes and sarcasm.  My ex couldn't take the ridicule and so he did an about face and said he really hadn't seen anything.  As you can imagine, I was furious with him for not standing up and telling them the truth. Years later, after we divorced, we met for drinks and he admitted to me that he had seen what I had seen, but could not take the ribbing from the other men in the room.

Orange glowing cylindrical spinning object - Roseburg Oregon;2004-02-20 23:30:00;5min;Orange glowing cylindrical spinning object - Roseburg Oregon My husband and I were driving southbound on hwy 99 to Roseburg (approx. Winchester) I noticed a glowing orange light about 600 feet above the ground. I asked him to pull over and see what it was. After we stopped the car, we saw that it was moving slowly in a straight line going southbound. As we got out of the car, it was above us. It had stopped moving. We noticed it was cylinder shaped. It was rotating like a spinning globe, with a tilt. After 2 min of watching this, it started moving in the same direction as before. Just then a cop car pulled up to see what we were doing. As my husband was talking to the police officers, I continued to watch it slowly move and flicker, almost like it was burning out. Then from the bottom of it, a glowing orange small object fell. As my husband was trying to explain and show them where it was, it had vanished. They then joked with us, thought we were lying. Then drove off.
