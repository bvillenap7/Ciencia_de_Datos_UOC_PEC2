I know we're expecting a meteor shower on August 12, but driving through the curves heading south from Roseburg on I-5 I saw what looked like one lone meteor, head downward, long tail behind. I happened to look up suddenly while entering the freeway from an on ramp of some small town just before Roseburg. Drove the curves for quite some  time with this object just continuing to descend it seemed, but never did. Lost sight of it around one curve and then it was gone. Appeared as though it would crash into the mountains, but didn't. So - was this an isolated meteor, or was it  something else? Wonder if anyone might know - I was  quite surprised to see this thing so bright and clear in broad daylight. This is the second time I have seen an anomalous object in the last several months - also reported that one  previously - this stuff is starting to creep me out as I have always thought I was a pretty grounded person and not unaccustomed to looking up at the sky and finding nothing remarkable!;43.2289254237289;-123.293894915256

Like a cloaked/invisible object that you can only see light reflecting off of it.  It wasn't moving.  It was just sitting in one spot.  I was driving for work so I didn't get out and record it.  It seemed to disappear and reappear over the 1 to 2 mins I did see it.  I wonder if anyone else saw it, because it was very eye catching and strange.;43.2289254237289;-123.293894915256
