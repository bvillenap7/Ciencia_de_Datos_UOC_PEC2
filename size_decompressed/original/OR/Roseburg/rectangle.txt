5 round white lights hovering over I-5.  ((NUFORC Note:  Report from law enforcement officer.  PD));2010-10-20 00:10:00;3 min;5 round white lights hovering over I-5. Driving south on I-5 in Roseburg at 1205 at night I saw 5 very large round white lights in a long row floating in air about 300 feet up.  They were even with top of hill and extended out of river.  I could not understand what they were since it was silently hovering there.  Others were pulled over on side of highway looking at it.  As I got closer it started to float north above I-5.  As it passed over me I could not see the stars or clouds between the lights so I believe it was a long solid object with the 5 lights.  The lights did not illuminate the ground or send out a beam like a car light.   It continued to head north above the highway.  I am in law enforcement and my husband is an ex air force pilot.  We have observed planes of every description as a hobby and I know that this was nothing either of us have seen before.
