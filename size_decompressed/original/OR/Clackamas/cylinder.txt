7-9 Amber colored, zig-zag patern. I CANNOT be the only one that saw these! I took pix too.;2004-01-21 20:26:00;1-2 min.;7-9 Amber colored, zig-zag patern. I CANNOT be the only one that saw these! I took pix too. At the time listed above it was partly cloudy. I just finished warming up my car and leaving the parking lot when I saw about 5 up-right rectangles (cylinders), amber (like street lamps) in color, slowly come out of the clouds. I was facing West, they were heading East. First 5 then 6,7... I stoped counting. I franticlly grabed my old Nikkon SLR in the dark and put the telephoto lens on the best I could without seeing much of what I was doing. I managed to get off 3 pictures then ran out of film. I continued tring to take the best mental notes I could they were in a zig-zag pattern (horizontally),then broke formation. The Northern-most one vanished in the clouds, another went North, a couple southern ones went South, the middle one was the most interesting because I could watch it with out any possible abstrution from clouds. I watched it go up, up, up through the clearing eventually vanishing. I later called PDX (airport) and told them my story. They said that it was reflactions of a jet in the clouds (I saw no jets,blinking lights, or heard sound). She was unable to help, so she directed me to this site. I saw these lights no more that 8 miles south-east of Portland, there has to be someone eles that saw them. As for my pix, the photo depatment could only do so much for my poor photography. Can I send the negatives to someone who can develope them more effectivelly?;45.4111;-122.517604761905
