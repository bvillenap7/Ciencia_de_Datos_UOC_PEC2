Silver circular or sphere-like object flying parallel to I-205 in the Gladstone/Clackamas area.;2007-10-11 16:00:00;15 minutes;Silver circular or sphere-like object flying parallel to I-205 in the Gladstone/Clackamas area. While traveling northbound on I-205, I saw a silver-ish circular or spherical item traveling parallel to the freeway, perhaps as far as a mile from, and above the tree line in that area. When I first saw it, it too was traveling northbound, parallel to the freeway.   At first I thought it may be a helicopter in the Clackamas rRver area, but was unable to discern any rotors or sounds.    It traveled back, this time southbound, parallel to the freeway.   I did turn off the highway in the area I had seen it, but could not locate it in the sky.   While I was observing it, it traveled close to 5 miles from where I had first seen it near the Gladsstone area, to the Clackamas area, and was returning to the Gladstone area.;45.4111;-122.517604761905
