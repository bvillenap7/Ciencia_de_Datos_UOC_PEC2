Lights in the fog;1979-07-15 07:30:00;2 seconds;Refer to the Austin Tx report of 06-29-2004. After reading this report I wanted to relate a similar experience I had. I was driving to work in the fog adjacent to the Fred Meyer warehouse in Clackamas and similar to the above report, I witnessed 5 round lights (smaller than the referenced report) about the size of beach balls, each one a solid color, blue, green, orange, and red. They passed in front of my vehicle at approximately 20 feet altitude, and 20 feet in front of me. These lights were following one another and oscillating (like a sine wave on an oscilliscope) in opposite wave patterns (when one was at the peak of the cycle the next would be at the bottom of the cycle). I have seen work trucks and police cars with flashing lights in the fog and this was not at all similar. There was no apparent beam, just individual round balls of light. They moved at approximately 40 miles per hour.  Just thought the witness would like to know that someone else has seen strange acting lights in the fog.;45.4111;-122.517604761905
Small lights in the sky over Clackamas, Oregon.;2014-01-23 22:00:00;5 minutes;small lights in the sky over Clackamas Oregon My son went outside to smoke and was looking up at the stars he then saw about 20 lights that looked to be the size of the stars but they were much closer.  He called me and my husband out and we observed 10-20 more of these lights moving from the east to west across the sky.  They did not have tails nor left a trail like a meteor would have and they did not appear to be dropping, just going across the whole sky until we could no longer see them.  These lights were gold/yellowish like the stars look like with the natural eye and were not close together like they were on an airplane or some other type of aircraft.  There was no noise heard and no auras or haze around the lights.;45.4111;-122.517604761905
