Two Bright Flashes Lit Up A Clear Night Sky And The Interior Of My House.;2014-08-03 02:30:00;A few seconds;Two Bright Flashes Lit Up A Clear Night Sky And The Interior Of My House I didn't see an actual craft.  I experienced bright flashes of light around 2:30 AM.  I was lying awake in bed and a bright flash of light lit up the whole interior of my house.  I sat up expecting a thunder clap but none came.  About 5 seconds later another flash lit up the house, again with no ensuing thunder. The flashes were way too bright, and had lit up the house too thoroughly to be a distant lightning flash and I suspected a storm was approaching rapidly.   I got out of bed and went out on the porch to check it out, because I had windows to close if the storm would be a strong one.  I saw a perfectly clear sky with lots of stars visible in each direction.   Nothing was amiss or out of place a the neighbor houses.   I'm baffled as to what the huge flashes of light may have been.;45.4111;-122.517604761905
