Had the most intense color white!;2002-02-22 00:30:00;4 seconds;Had the most intense color white! standing outside,looking over a soccer building, smoking. There was no streak or any warning- All of a sudden there was this great throbbing of light side to side.Bright, no colors and very large in span. It only lasted for a few seconds. Branching fom center out.The span and action is nothing like I've ever seen. Several mins. later a commercial plan flew from the west and never compared to the size of what I saw. Amazing how bright and coordinated the flash of lights were.;45.4111;-122.517604761905
