The craft was silver and reflective, it was traveling in several different directions taking sharp turns and making abrupt stops. As I got closer I noticed the triangle shape and the strip of red lights following the edge of the craft and blue on the oposit side. By that point the craft was to the left back side of my car traveling under the over pass. Shocking but true, yesterday evening myself as well as several other drivers witnessed an event that is truly out of this world.

Triangle, adjusting size.;2014-08-17 21:10:00;30 minutes;Triangle, adjusting size My mother and I went swimming ablout 9ish, about 10 minutes into enjoying the summer evening and a relaxing swim she noticed something odd. I noticed what she was looking at and at first I thought it was just a plane, but the orb was not moving and pulsing red and white, then noticed two more lights that remained white forming a giant triangle. The lights were in the S SW are of the sky above the Lake Oswego area across the Willamette river from where we are. The size of the triangle did not remain constant but enlarged and shrunk. We let the other two younger people in the pool near us know what we were looking at. About 15 minutes later the triangle shrunk onto the flashing orb and the orb remained. Upon leaving I noticed a bright flash about 5 o'clock to the flashing orbs location.;45.4111;-122.517604761905
