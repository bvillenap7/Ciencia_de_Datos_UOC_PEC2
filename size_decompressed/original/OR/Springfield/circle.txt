It looked like a moving star, color was red, but very small. It traveled from north to southwest. As it was traveling southwest, it broke up into two stars, one continued southwest and the other spun out and dropped down and then disappeared. It looked liked there was a short but breif lazer light exchange between the two stars. This is not the first time i've witness this. ALWAYS in the same area or location. I was out looking for the space shuttle, and was viewing the other side when I saw this.;44.0573962962964;-122.95374691358
Many bright lights moving very fast in the nights sky.;2007-04-25 00:00:00;2-3 hours;Many bright lights moving very fast in the nights sky. My brother and I go out on our deck often. We have seen many things in the nights sky that we cannot explain. Tonight was a little different. We saw multiple bright objects in the sky that seem to be paralell to each other. A great distance apart. These light were moving very fast as if they were moving in a circle and up and down in all directions. They would stop for a short time and start moving again. My brother and I seemed to think there was a pattern after staring at them for a long time. The moon was very bright tonight and there were two straight across from each other, one being closest to the moons light and was moving in all directions but staying in the same area where we first saw it. Anyway, after watching these for a long time I thought I would try and find some information about posting what we saw tonight. Well, If anyone else has seen the same, we would love to chat about it.

Black Saucer UFO Spotted Over Springfield OR;2019-11-24 16:30:00;1 minute;Black Saucer UFO Spotted Over Springfield OR I was out fly fishing the Willamette River for trout at Clearwater Park here in Springfield when I had an encounter with a black saucer UFO.  I was getting out of the water after wading out and heading to the main trail to find a different spot to wade out to a fish when I happened to look up in the sky and spot what at first I thought was a black balloon.  After a few seconds I realized it was no balloon, since it was slowly moving up and down, then paused to hover for a few seconds, and looked nothing like a balloon.  I watched it move like this for about a minute before it sped off and disappeared behind the treeline.  I would guess it was about 400ft off the ground.  It was heading northeast towards the hills, about the side of a helicopter, shaped like a black saucer, and made no noise as it moved.;44.0573962962964;-122.95374691358
A stationary red circle moves down straight in sky, emits light, stops briefly and moves in a perfect straight line to its left.;2021-07-21 05:30:00;About 1 minute;A stationary red circle moves down straight in sky, emits light, stops briefly and moves in a perfect straight line to its left. It was early morning, overcast and before the sun had come above the horizon. I was outside facing southeast when I noticed a red circle in the sky. I figured it to be a bright planet or satellite till it moved directly downwards in a perfectly straight line before coming to a hovering stop once more. I believe I may have seen a white light also come from the bottom of the the red circle around this time. After staying perfectly still in its new position for a few moments it then started to move to its left in the same unwavering, straight motion as it had when it dropped position. During this movement trees obscured my vision and I did not see what happened after. The distance I perceived the circle to be at was far but within the cloud layer. To my eye it looked as though it was moving fast during its perfect movement. I did not see anything other than the red circle and what may have been white light from the bottom of the circle.;44.0573962962964;-122.95374691358
