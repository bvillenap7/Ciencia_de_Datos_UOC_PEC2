Springfield, OR sightings of bright, multicolored lights near moon;2007-07-25 23:00:00;Hours;Springfield, OR sightings of bright, multicolored lights near moon My wife and I witnessed a bright orange-yellow light floating at a helicopter speed in the night sky. The object was headed southward and contained no directional lights such as port or starboard signals. The object eventually fell away from eyesight. It appeared to be lower in the sky than usual aircraft. I saw another conventional commercial airliner off in the distance to use as a gauge for speed and elevation. After the disappearance of the bright orange-yellow light, we spotted a very bright “star” eastward of the night’s almost full moon. This bright star brought our attention to a pair of very twinkling lights that at first seemed to be very excited stars. We were able to spot these through a scope to see that these objects were flashing three bright colors Red, yellow, and blue flashed in what seemed random order. To get a closer look, we headed up a nearby butte. When arriving at the top of the butte, we quickly noticed there were at least five of these combination lights. They appeared to be situated at all different heights in the sky and at different ranges. Focusing on the largest/closest object, we could see indeed that these lights had three main colors that revolved very brightly. The position of the lights did not appear to create a definitive form, but a V-like shape could almost be made out by tracing the lights together. We watched the lights for approximately 90 minutes, from 11:30pm to 1:00am.;44.0573962962964;-122.95374691358

Small Bright light moving across sector of sky then quickly disappearing;2008-09-22 17:40:00;1 MIN;Small Bright light moving across sector of sky then quickly disappearing loking East above house from driveway. Roughly 60 degrees from north and 45 degrees from horizon. A bright white light (slightly brighter than Jupiter was at the same time in the South) slowly moved to the east north east. Light maintained brighness for aproximately 40 seconds then rapidly dimmed to a faint red over a 10 second period then disappeared completely. There was no cloud cover in the area. If this was a satelite, this would be the brightest and largest satelite I have ever seen.;44.0573962962964;-122.95374691358
bright orange reddish color object observed rising untill it just dissappeared.;2009-06-13 21:00:00;1 1/2 mins.;bright orange reddish color object observed rising until it just disappeared. This object appeared to rise up from the ground wobbling. then proceeded to travel straight up northeast direction while elevating high into the sky. it was looking like the light was just dimming out as it was rising. until it just turned off like a light switch. but when it first started up it was really bright like a real close star but dimmed more and more as it was rising. the color of the light was an orange reddish color.although when it first lifted it was multiple colors.;44.0573962962964;-122.95374691358
Two lights flying in loose formation disappear in sudden vertical climb. ((NUFORC Note:  ISS and Space Shuttle in formation.  PD));2009-09-08 21:20:00;5 minutes;Two lights flying in loose formation disappear in sudden vertical climb. At approximately 2125 Pacific Daylight Time, September 8, 2009, I was leaving a friends home walking to my truck.  I noticed two bright, -2 to -4 star-like objects in the western sky.  At first I thought they were stars but their obvious motion eliminated that possibility.  The second thought was that they were aircraft, possibly jetliners at high altitude.  But their apparent path, traveling from west to east eliminated that possibility as well.  (Commercial aircraft at altitude DO NOT normally travel from east to west over this area.  The normal path for commercial air traffic is north-south, generally traveling between the major west coast airports of Seattle, Portland, San Francisco and Los Angeles.  Aircraft heading east from this area do so at lower altitudes taking off from the local airport the turning east.) 	Viewing conditions were clear, with no clouds.  The two lights were the brightest objects in the sky while they were visible. I called my friend over to view these objects and she was startled at their apparent motion across the night sky.  We thought they might be satellites but that was dispelled when the lead light changed course from a west-east direction to a north by northeast course. Having had years of observing satellites, (I’m old enough to have seen Sputnik’s first crossing of the Pacific Northwest sky) the speed of these two lights was much faster than a normal satellite.  Their apparent altitude was within the atmosphere but very high up.  I say this because there was no “twinkle” as with the other star objects visible at the time of this sighting. These two lights were traveling at identical speeds.  The lead light was ahead and north of the second as viewed from the ground.  The first light passed in front of the Big Dipper.  The second light, from our viewing location passed below the Big Dipper and farther south than the first.  I would guess the observed separation to be between 40 to 60 degrees north to south and about the same west to east. Shortly after the first light changed course it went vertical.  In less than ten seconds it disappeared from sight.  From our viewing point (I’ll send the actual Latitude and Longitude if you like) the first light disappeared just a little west of the constellation Cassiopeia. Right after the first one disappeared the second light changed course the same as the first.  Then it too went vertical and in less than ten seconds disappeared.  The second light followed the same vertical course as the first. There was no sound accompanying these two lights.  We listened long and hard to try to hear the faintest of sounds but heard none. These lights might have been military aircraft but the vertical acceleration argues against that idea.  Also, for two military jets to go vertical at such velocity would have required a considerable burn from their engines.  No engine noise or glow was seen. Once the two lights went vertical they faded from sight. Thanks. ((NUFORC Note:  ISS and Space Shuttle in formation.  PD));44.0573962962964;-122.95374691358
Blinking blue lights moving and sinking below the horizon;2013-04-20 22:15:00;5 minutes;blinking blue lights moving and sinking below the horizon Multiple blinking lights in the sky towards the south west headed to the west and lowering into the horizon. I was sitting outside and all of a sudden a line of blinking lights appeared in the sky. They started moving so I went and got my boyfriend to ask him what they were. He didn't know so he went and got his dad.  His dad was baffled and called out our room mate.  He also grabbed a camera and attempted to take pictures. He then stopped a guy on the side of the road and pointed them out to them. They were star colored and the last few in the line weren't moving as much as the others. They all blinked rapidly and moved up and down in the sky.  The first one moved higher in the air and continued to flash.  The next 3-4 lowered and moved back up, they also continued to flash.  They all headed westward and sank below the buildings and out of view.;44.0573962962964;-122.95374691358
Orange Orb flies over Springfield.;2013-12-13 22:15:00;5 minutes;Orange Orb flies over Springfield. I was sitting in bed watching tv. I looked out my window and noticed a slow moving orange light flying west.  I was facing south. I watched for a minute just wondering what it was, then it got brighter.  As it brightened, it split into two other glowing lights.  I am not sjre the distance from me to the orb, but the two other lights that aplit from the first fell back, one flew lower, as the other went higher.  They drifted a good distance away from the first and then got up to the same speed as the first.  They flew like this for about a minute and the the first light got brignter again, and the other two lights increased speed and went back into the first light.   At this point I opened my windows and tried to listen for sounds.  The object was silent, but when I opened my window my dog stood up on the bed and growled for a second, the fur on her back stood up.  She ran for the door.   The light then increased speed and just took off out of view. The whole event lasted around five minutes.;44.0573962962964;-122.95374691358
Circular vague light traveling at high speeds in jerky circles... very strange.;2013-12-22 20:30:00;15 minutes;circular vague light traveling at high speeds in jerky circles... very strange We Witnessed a continually circling light object. It was traveling at incredible speeds. It appeared at first to be a beam of light,  Like from a huge spotlight...  But there was no bean coming from the ground,  And no disruptions as it would have gone through trees or other tall objects...  And to move a beam of light in this fashion would have required multiple people and super human like athletic abilities ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

I had noticed a bright blue light outside my window hovering above the tree line at approx. 20:30.   About an hour later, I looked outside just in time to see it arch across the sky as it fell.  My first thought was that a street light fell over, but I went outside to see where this light would have been, it would be far too high for a street light.;44.0573962962964;-122.95374691358
Daylight all around me, lasting approx. 1.5 seconds, then dark, then light again for 0.5-1 sec.  ((NUFORC Note:  Power pole down.

Daylight at Night:  	On August 6, 2017, at approximately 1:03am pst, in Springfield, Oregon, I witnessed a bright light.  (I was on I-5, going south towards Springfield, in my vehicle, about 1 mile north of the Beltline.)  The bright light was not from high beams of another car, but a very, very bright light, like daylight all around me!  I could see the mountains, or hills, to my left, and I could see the color of the grass and trees as if it were daytime!  It lasted about 1.5 to 2 seconds, went back to dark, then back to the same bright light for about 0.5 to 1 second.   I drove for approximately .5 of a mile or less, before pulling over to call the Oregon State Police dispatch, to report it, and to find out if anyone else saw the bright light, or if there was an explanation.  I described the incident to the dispatch woman, and she said she would put it out there, and find out if any officers had witnessed it. To my surprise, after I made a voice recording of what I saw, there was a voicemail from t! he same dispatch woman!  She called to let me know that 2 state police officers had indeed witnessed the bright light, and didn't know what it was either!  Since the incident, I have recalled it over, and over all day today (it is still August 6).  I realize that it was a very big light, and a light that moved across the landscape and me in my car.  I know it was a very big light, because it seemed to light up landscape at least 100 feet in front  of  me, and to my left at least 200 feet or more, in my best guess. ((NUFORC Note:  The source of the report has reported accurately.  However, the Oregon State Patrol Dispatch [(541) 726-2536] and Lane County, Oregon, Dispatch [(541) 682-5111] report that a bulldozer, working under dubious circumstances, had struck a power pole, perhaps knocking it over, which had caused a very dramatic flash of light, and a resulting grass fire.  Emergency vehicles and utility repair personnel were dispatched to the site.  We express our gratitude to the OSP and Lane County dispatch centers for their efficient, and cheerful, assistance, which allowed our Center to solve this case quickly.

As a former professional pilot of 20 years, my friend called to my attn. a white light coming directly over his house in Springfield.;2018-07-20 22:30:00;5 minutes;As a former pilot of 20 years professionally  my friend called to my attention a white light coming directly over his house in Springfield, OR, from the the south.  I estimated it was in the 30's as far as altitude.  No sound but moving very quickly.   Might be an aircraft, but  what was weird is the large bright light stayed bright even when it passed to the north.  No beacon or strobes of any kind.  In fact other aircraft were in the sky at the time and as a pilot I do know the difference.   I would say its speed was double of what the other aircraft were traveling at the time.  We will be out tonight to see if it reoccurs.  Thank you.;44.0573962962964;-122.95374691358

At approximately 23:00, I observed a very bright light speed across the sky at an altitude of what seemed to be about that of typical helicopter altitude would be.  It was moving west to east at a very high rate of speed.  It was completely silent.  It left no trail as a meteor would.  The light was solid bright white with not other identifying lights on it.  I have worked in aviation for 3 1/2 years.  Nothing that I am aware of could move that fast in total silence.  It covered a couple miles of sky in about 3 seconds before going out of sight due to tall trees.  Other than that there was no obstruction of view.;44.0573962962964;-122.95374691358
