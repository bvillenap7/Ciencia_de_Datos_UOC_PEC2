brilliant  flash of light;2003-09-17 02:00:00;1 sec;brilliant  flash of light New strange things.  I was sleeping the other night and was awakened at about 2am by what sounded like glass breaking outside. I went outside for a moment and looked around but saw and heard nothing from my second story deck. Since I live in a second story pent house like appartment I wasn't overly concerned about it. It was quiet and calm with nothing going on. When I went into the kitchen to have a glass of water I saw a very bright flash of light through my dinning room windows that were covered by curtains completly. The bright light flashed for one second perhaps two at the most. Since the windows are very large and tall I opened the curtains immediatly and expected to hear a clasp of thunder within seconds, the weather at that moment was steady light drizzle and no wind at all. I STOOD THERE WAITING FOR THE THUNDER BUT IT NEVER CAME. I then noticed that the bright light had knocked out all the street lights for a two block radius. After about 30 seconds the lights slowly turned back on like they do at sundown. I was so intriged by the event that I made some coffee and stayed up for 3 more hours watching from my vantage point over the city streets and waiting for the light to happen again or a laser or some kind of power ark in the power lines but nothing moved or happened. It occured to me that my neighbor about a week ago said that he saw the entire sky turn into day for a split second at about 12:30 at night, but I just said wow that's interesting and forgot about it until now. I've had a lot of scientific training and I can't think of what the light could have been. I'm just stumped on even a hypothosis on this one. The other thing I wanted to say is that I too have seen on many occasions star-like lights that make turns at super high altitudes or blink on and off in completely clear night skies. I can imagine a rotating metalic cylindrical satelyte that reflects light from one side because it is painted black on the other, so it would appear to be blinking as it moved accross t! he sky as it rotated. I can't explain in any rational way the star like objects that I see that turn and then faid out while still very high in the sky nowhere near the horizon. There is definately something going on up there. It sure is good to have a site like this available to us where we can compare notes!;44.0573962962964;-122.95374691358
Multi-colored flashes over Eugene, Oregon.;2014-09-11 22:19:00;unknown;Multi-colored flashes over Eugene, Oregon On this night, my husband and I spotted a flashing light of blue, red, white of an almost octagonal shape from a side view with the lights flashing in a spider web like fashion within it.  It was in the Northwest direction.  When observed in binoculars it appeared to be bouncing all over.;44.0573962962964;-122.95374691358
