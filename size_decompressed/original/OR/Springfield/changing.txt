Shape changing UFO's in Springfield, Oregon.;2015-12-30 19:30:00;5 hours;Shape changing UFO's in Springfield, Oregon I was walking back from my niece's house back to my sisters house.   When I looked up at the clear night, I saw what I thought appeared to be an UFO.  I looked around and saw more, anywhere from 7 to 15 craft.  It looked like an airplane but was not moving.   There were red, green, blue lights around a white ball in the middle.  There were lots of stars around the UFO, which is what drew my attention to it in the first place.  It just stayed in one spot.  I kept going outside and checking on it for the next 5 hours.  At around 12:30 pm, it was gone. The smaller ones were gone also.   Observers were a female age 45 and her nephew age 25.;44.0573962962964;-122.95374691358
