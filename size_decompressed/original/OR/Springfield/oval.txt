Large oblong Bright & Colorfully Lite Up With No Sound Flew Right Above The Trees.;2003-08-28 18:30:00;15 minutes;Large Oblong Bright & Colorfully Lite Up With No Sound Flew Right Above The Trees this event happened the night Mars was closest to the Earth, August 28, 2003. I was visiting my son and daughter in law on a mountain where they had an apartment on the end of a large building. We walked out at dark to see the star Mars, but when we walked out straight ahead was a Very Bright Star and my son ((name deleted)) thought that was Mars, and I said NO Mars is more to the South, that Star is to the East... we got to the end of the large building and sure enough there was Mars.... BUT.....  We were intrigued by this 'other star' as it was so bright and went to the edge of the mountain (we were on the top of a gravel pit yard)... and as we were watching this 'star' it rose up directly upward quite a ways and we couldn't believe what we saw ... and then after only seconds watching it,,, i said,,, I think it is 'coming' toward us and we all started running back to the door way of the apartment (while my son got his camera out of his truck he used every day for work)... when we were at the door way we looked up and the object was colorfully lit up with the most beautiful lights I had ever seen in my life... they were gorgeous.... not so many lights were in the front of the object that appeared around 75 feet long ~ was an oblong shape.... my son's camera would NOT WORK and we were very disappointed... my daughter in law wanted to run out under the object that was just above the tree tops (around 70 feet) and I would not let her go because I had seen the movie: FIRE IN THE SKY ~ and did not trust whatever this object was about... we blinked and then it was GONE ~ that quickly... didn't even see it take off  It just vanished faster than we could even turn our heads.... we were all in total shock because NO SOUND CAME FROM THE CRAFT.....  This really did happen and we have never forgotten it!  Rhonda Schartz;44.0573962962964;-122.95374691358
Craft seen in daylight over Oregon;2003-09-01 11:00:00;10 min;Craft seen in daylight over Oregon While looking up in clear morning skies, I saw 2 oval shaped craft flying in formation to my west at 1 o' clock position heading south at approx 5,000 - 10,000 feet traveling at approx. 300 - 400 mph as they transversed the entire sky from my 1 oclock position to southern horizon, my 9 oclock position in about ten minutes. While I observed with my neighbor the two grey colored craft flying together with several hundred yards separation but in definite formation one slightly higher and in front of the other, I noticed a (blurry) pinkish orange object below the other two in apparent formation with the slightly larger and more defined grey colored craft above it.  The three objects moved at a constant speed in constant formation to the south and no exsaust trails or sounds where heard. No anti collision lights where seen and no markings could be seen. From my view the objects where smaller and slower than airliners and there was a brief discusion as to the close proximity of the craft, that they could not have been airliners. My neighbor thinks they might have been military aircraft but I do not agree. I was in Navy aviation for many years and am highly trained in observations and understand aviation and air traffic. As the 3 objects moved out of vision to the south horizon, the sun light from the east brilliantly refected off all 3 objects and they looked like 3 bright stars as they faided out of my view. It would be interesting to check into radar logs to see if they corespond.;44.0573962962964;-122.95374691358
