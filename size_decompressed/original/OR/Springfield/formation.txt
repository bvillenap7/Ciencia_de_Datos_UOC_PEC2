Looking down our street I saw a red steady glowing light moving in the air coming from the North East and moving right over our property heading South West.   As I watched it, ahead of it were two more.  They were spaced about a half block apart and following the same path.    I dashed in the house and hollered for my husband.  When he came out, he got to see two of them.  I saw a total of five.  Absolutely no sound came from them.   I have cataracts so they appeared to me like fire red star burst balls like the size of headlights on the hwy..  My husband saw a slight square or triangle shape glowing steady fire-red.    We were just amazed.  We have never seen anything like it.;44.0573962962964;-122.95374691358
