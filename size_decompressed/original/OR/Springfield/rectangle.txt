bright, white space shuttle sited 15,000 - 20,000' over springfield, oregon, 7:14am 08/08/05, no sound;2005-08-08 07:15:00;5 min;bright, white space shuttle sited 15,000 - 20,000' over springfield, oregon, 7:14am 08/08/05, no sound at 7:15am on 08/08/05 my husband went out to get the paper.  as he was coming back to the house he noticed the space shuttle above our house, very low.  he called to me to hurry out and see it, i did, and there it was!  it was bright white and angular.  the morning was sunny with a few wispy white clouds.  the sun was shining directly onto the space shuttle and it was very clear.  there was no sound  we estimated its altitude to be 15,000 to 20,000' -- much lower than an airplane.  the space shuttle was BEAUTIFUL!  i went back into the house and attempted to call some news stations, but it was too early to reach anyone.  finally, after 9am i reached one station and was told that someone else had called in to report seeing the shuttle.  (i wonder if that person was me, leaving a message during my initial excitement of seeing the shuttle.)  i turned the news on and then learned that the space shuttle was still at high altitude and was certainly not the the space shuttle we had seen.  as i continued to make phone calls i was referred to 'the tower' at the airport in eugene.  they had had some special planes in over the weekend, but the woman i spoke to in the tower said their last plane had left, its departure time did not coincide with our sighting of the space shuttle, and the plane did not resemble the space shuttle.  the woman in the tower referred me to 'seattle ufo'.  i wonder if we had seen a 'secondary shuttle', which may have been checking out weather conditions over edwards air force base because the shuttle was not going to be able to land in florida.  my husband is an engineer.  my career was in the legal field.  we both felt that we were very clearly looking at the space shuttle.  did anyone else see the space shuttle at this time and place?;44.0573962962964;-122.95374691358
