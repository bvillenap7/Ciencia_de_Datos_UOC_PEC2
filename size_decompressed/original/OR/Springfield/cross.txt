T-shaped UFO with red and blue lights sighted in Springfield, OR.;2013-11-25 17:09:00;30 seconds;A T shaped UFO with red and blue lights sighted in Springfield, OR. My girlfriend picked me up from work, and we went to Wal-Mart here in Springfield, OR.  The sun had gone down and the sky was dusky with a few streaks of clouds.  We had just parked the car and got out to do some Christmas shopping when my girlfriend tugged on my arm and said, What is that?   I looked up and saw a very strange looking craft.  It was vaguely T-shaped, like a capital letter T laying on its side.  On the horizontal part were four equally-spaced, brilliant red lights, and on the vertical part were four equally spaced blue lights.  The object seemed to be as large as a jet airliner at about 1000 ft altitude above ground, and then proceeded to fly to the west.  It followed a curving path towards the north as it flew (very quickly) away, and was out of sight in 30 seconds.  It made absolutely NO sound. Another lady who was getting out of her car was only feet away and saw what we were looking at.  She asked, What is that thing?  I have worked in aviation as an aircraft fueler, and I know that any lights that are not FAA approved are probably not going to appear on an aircraft.  I have never, ever seen brilliant blue lights on a general aviation aircraft.  I told the lady, What you are looking at is a UFO - holy crap holy crap holy crap!   I wish we had time to get our phones out to take pictures, but my phone sucks and can't even photograph the moon decently.  :-(;44.0573962962964;-122.95374691358
