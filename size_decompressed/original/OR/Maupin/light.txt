I caught sight of a small moving light, similar to that of a sattelite.  I pointed it out ot my girlfriend and we watched it travel across the sky, then, gradually it picked up speed.  The speed that it was traveling and the altitude this object put it at a very high rate of speed.   The object then slowed and veered from its course from NW to SE back to NW.  Then proceeded to travel N, then circled around to head back in its original path of SE.  We watched as it then begin to blink dim to bright very fast as it traveled for some clouds on the horizon to the SE.  These high clouds still somewhat visible even for the hour.  The object traveled into the clouds and we never saw it come out.  That was the last we saw of that object.  Never have seen anything like it, scared my girlfriend and gave me a sense of awe that made me feel as if I was dreaming, when clearly I was not.
