Wormhole event filmed from Boardman OR;2021-04-01 18:37:00;4 minutes;Wormhole event filmed from Boardman OR While taking photos of the sunset, I first noticed an unusual cloud that appeared to be emitting a beam.  Then I realized I was seeing something incredible, and familiar.  I was seeing an open wormhole.  Something I have seen before, ref 7-5-2018 Seaside OR.  I have one still photo and a 4 minute raw video. From left to right in the video, the wormhole, the craft creating the wormhole and 3 orange clouds that are what I recognized as a wormhole that is closing.  The twisting bright orange clouds go away in about a minute and a half.   The craft can be seen with a beam coming out to the left as though it is the power source for the wormhole event.   At the 4 minute mark it gracefully fades away.   I looked back at my photos and a half an hour earlier I found a possible black triangle in one photo, itâ€™s a stretch but I am including the photo.   It appears to be pointed at what becomes the subject in the video.;45.8271999999998;-119.7206
