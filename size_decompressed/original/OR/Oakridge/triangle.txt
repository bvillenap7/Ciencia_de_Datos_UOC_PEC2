Triangular-Egg shaped craft caught in still photo north of Klamath Falls, Or.;2020-12-31 20:50:00;7 seconds;Triangular-Egg shaped craft caught in still photo north of Klamath Falls, Or. Attached is a 7 second long exposure shot taken on my iPhone 11 Pro 12/31/2020 at 8:50 pm on highway 58 headed south towards Klamath Falls I believe between Odell and Crescent Lake. My girlfriend and I were driving south down 58 and I kept having an impulse to look to my left window as the moon was dazzlingly bright and the night sky full of detail. I decided to slow my car to a halt in the middle of 58 as it was almost 9:00 pm with cars neither ahead or behind me as far as the eye could see. After I stopped my car I killed the lights and turned it off. It was dark ahead, behind, and all around me the only details to be seen were what was illuminated by moonlight. I stepped out and standing as still as I could muster took a 7 second long exposure shot of the night sky which initially I thought nothing of. Two days later while inspecting the photo I noticed 3 red lights in the top left of the frame in what appears to be a round or egg shaped-something in the cloud. If anything could be gleamed from this I love to hear proposals for what could contribute to the phenomenon seen in the photo given a long exposure 7 second time-frame on an iPhone 11 Pro in the dead of night with no possible light interference.;43.7378;-122.4431
