I seen a floating slab it was thinner than is was wider and longer.  ((anonymous report));2016-07-28 01:00:00;1 minute;I was standing in the yard with my friend at 230 am looking into the milky way for shooting stars.  I noticed something moving off to my left about 500ft up above me I seen a floating slab it was thinner than is was wider and longer.  I looked up I was looking at the bottom of it and I can see white spots on the bottom of the slab about six to eight white spots.  It moved out in front of my vision to where it was out in front of me and took a nose down dip down and as it came down it started to pull out of it.  It went up 1800 ft at a 45deg angle and stopped.  Then I'm looking up in the sky i notice something behind to my right, I seen a dark blue line coming verticle down behind me as it was closer by me it looked like a blue shingle slicing down then it levels out above my head and I seen the bottom was the same as the last one then I pointed at it with my friend next to me and said Look,then it took a little dip then went up like 10 deg into the sky where the last one stopped and it went right up behind it and stopped.  Then off to the right a blue square slab just started going up and went off behind the second one.  Now I pointed at them in the sky and I said what?  And I started to say ufos!!  About the time I said ufo the 3rd time it just started to dim and went to the normal black sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.
