Large object moves slowly across early morning sky with shooting stars and comet tails.;2016-02-10 05:00:00;12-15 minutes;Large object moves slowly across early morning sky with shooting stars and comet tails. At approximately 5:00 a.m. a cloud of double shaped crescent appeared at approximately 15 degrees above the horizon at 1:00.  It appeared to be clouds.  Moved very slowly and increased in size until the crescent closed to a full circle. At 8:00 in relation to the clouds there was what looked like a comet's tail outside of the circle.  The circle continued to move to the southwest very slowly.  Outside the circle at approximately 3:00 there were three shooting stars.  Another star flashed three times directly above the shooting star. As the large tire shaped cloud moved across the sky at 12:00 a white light appeared in the middle.  The comet tail outside the circle remained at approximately the same size and relationship. A plume of smoke slowly came from the light at the center of the cloud circle at about 15 degrees to the circle.  This, too, looked like a comets tail, but was less well defined than the first.  The circle of clouds covered much of the sky prior to dissapating.  The cloud slowly disappeared as the light plume grew brighter and the tire shaped cloud disappeared. The light and the tail eventual disappeared at the horizon in a tree line. This lasted approximately 15 minutes.;43.7378;-122.4431
