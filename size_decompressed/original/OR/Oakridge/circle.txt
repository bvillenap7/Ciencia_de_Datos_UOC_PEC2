Flying orange glowing sphere seen by 3 adults;2012-07-19 21:44:00;5 + minutes;flying orange glowing sphere seen by 3 adults At 9:44pm I was called outside by sister-in-law and my son to observe a flying orange glowing sphere. (From my perspective it looked to be 10 plus feet in diameter comparing it to the distant tree tops)  The object was moving southeast above the mountain tops approximately 1 or more miles from us.  It descended dropping altitude to the north side of the mountain moving at a steady slow speed.  We observed the object for approximately 5 minutes, it looked as if it descended into the tree line, or the light went out.;43.7378;-122.4431
