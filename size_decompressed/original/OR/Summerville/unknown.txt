I was sitting up in bed because, I woke up 15 mins earlier to get some tea, was unable to sleep.  Earlier in the evening it was super windy. All the wind stopped and was very still and quiet out.  I heard a low humming noise coming from above my house at 3:25 am then the sound got so loud it made my ears ring.  My dog which was on the bed next to me, she was looking up towards the ceiling and whimpering.  It lasted 10 mins and started to disparate after 5 mins longer.  I looked out the window. It was foggy and visibility was poor.  I saw a flash of white light.  Within a few minutes after this happened I got a migraine headache.  On the right side of my stomach, there is a rash with little bumps.  Iâ€™ve been seeing odd lights in the area in the past 2 months;45.5076;-118.0261
