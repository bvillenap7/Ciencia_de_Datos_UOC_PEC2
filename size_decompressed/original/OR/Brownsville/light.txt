We spotted a bright light as we got onto our exit (216) and noticed a bright white light getting brighter (Like headlights) and closer going South and stopped our car to observe.  It went over us and curved East.  There were orange/red lights on the bottom and on the back and we noted it had a triangular shape.  It was moving too fast and low to be an airplane with no blinking lights but too slow to be a meteor.  It seemed to zig-zag as it flew away and disappeared in the distance.;44.3762;-122.9531
