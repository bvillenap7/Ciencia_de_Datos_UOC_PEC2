((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-17 21:45:00;2 minutes;Large Triangular Craft seen over Brownsville Oregon in night sky on April 17, 2020. I was sitting outside in my hot tub which is faced directly south.  To the SW is the Eugene airport.  I observed two white lights traveling generally towards my position but to the west a bit. I often observed aircraft near EUG but these lights were not taking off or landing. I noticed the two lights never changed their distance from each other and that they were not blinking.  They were white and no other color was seen.  As the lights came  close it seemed between the two lights there were many more small, white lights One to two dozen perhaps.  To the west of our deck are some tall trees and the lights stayed above that horizon.  As I saw them I started thinking, those lights have to be about 15,000 feet and I can not see an outline of a craft!  I was in the Air Force and have seen many types of aircraft.  This, appeared much larger than anything I have experienced and it was triangular.  A bright light in the front and one in the back, with several small lights scattered on itâ€™s underneath.  I got out of the water and moved so I could see it continue NNE.  We live in a south facing hill and it disappeared beyond as I looked North.  As I clearly saw the outline of the craft at its altitude the distance front and aft was about two inches from my vantage.  I never heard any sound that would be expected from an aircraft flying in proximity.  I hurried into the house told my wife and then called my brother who had a significant sighting many years ago.;44.3762;-122.9531
