Big, bright, orangish, hovering light that blinked colors.;2015-03-29 21:45:00;30 minutes;big, bright, orangish, hovering light that blinked colors My husband and i were lying in bed looking out the window from our home thay sits 800 ft in elevation. We saw what we originally believed to be a very big bright star.  We stared at this,  bright orangish yellow object that blinked colors of red, yellow and orange, for atleast an hour.  It eventually was out of view but hovered and moved in a wobble type pattern for about 30 minutes until eventually only the brigjtness and lights could be detected seeming to move towards I5.;44.3762;-122.9531
