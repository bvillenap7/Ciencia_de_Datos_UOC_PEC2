unblinking star-like lights moving N.E.high and very fast.One every 5 or ten minutes.All taking about the same path.;1999-08-04 21:00:00;several hours each night;((NUFORC Note:  Report is reminiscent of the many satellites which cross the sky every night and morning.)) unblinking star-like lights moving N.E.high and very fast.One every 5 or ten minutes.All taking about the same path. My wife and I were star-gazing on two seperate evenings when we noticed crafts that looked like stars appearing at the top of the sky and heading N.E.(making a slow arching turn)They were not blinking. They were very high and moving very fast.The second night we saw more of the same thing.One of the objects was making quick left right turns,like a race car driver warming up their tires.What is N.E. that the are all heading to?;42.4889;-123.1587
two ufos circled each other;2008-06-30 21:00:00;about 5 minutes;two ufos circled each other well one night me, my cousin and two of our friends were watching the stars and for some reason we were all drawn to one star. it was different from any other stars because there were no stars close to it. so we are all looking at this star when what looked like another star smoothly flew over next to it. then, bear with me on this, they began to circle each other for at least 5 minutes. when done, the one flew over left just a easily as it came and the one that was already there went back to its place ((NUFORC NOTE:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));42.4889;-123.1587
August 13,2012 Two orange spheres seen on the Rogue river in Southern Oregon;2012-08-13 21:30:00;15 seconds;August 13,2012 Two orange spheres seen on the Rogue river in Southern Oregon My friends and I were rafting on the Lower Rogue River in Southern Oregon on August 13th. That evening in camp, Wildcat camp GPS (N42 39.537 W123 38.301), we were sitting and talking between 2100 and 2200.  Initially there was a sound that seemed like it was a jet plane flying in the distance. We then saw a white flash of light and looking up into the night sky we observed two orange spheres that were moving slowly. As we were facing them the light on the left moved towards the one on the right and they merged together into one light.  The single remaining light just disappeared. The entire event lasted for approximately 15 seconds.;42.4889;-123.1587

I will reference this observation using the North Star as the 12 o'clock position and the North Star as North. The object was stationary when it appeared. In an instant it disappeared and reappeared at approx. 12 o'clock and again was stationary for approx. 5 to 10 seconds. It then again disappeared and reappeared at approx. 2 o'clock position towards the East, again object was stationary for another 5 to 10 seconds. Again disappearing and then reappeared at a right angle due North from last position or 90 degreee as described above. It then disappeared and reappeared at approx. the 5 o'clock position to the Southwest, which was approx. a 45 degree path from its last position. Again the object was stationary for approx. 5-10 seconds. This was last see position, from there it would have been obsc! ured by foothills and trees. Please note the object only appeared when the object was stationary. I could not see the object as it was moving. The object seem to be faster than the light it produce, and or the light only caught up when object stopped or hovered or was stationary, possibly the light was anti-gravity or field that kept object stationary or hovering. It also seems to move in straight lines with the same increments of travel at each change of position, except the position changes seem to be near instantly. With the object only seen for the 5 to 10 seconds increments in which displaying the light only when stationary, stopped or hovering. I have never seen anything move so fast or there were multiple objects.;42.4889;-123.1587
