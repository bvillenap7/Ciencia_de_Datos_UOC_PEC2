Red object flying then expelling another red object;2019-03-14 19:50:00;3 minutes;Red object flying then expelling another red object On March 14, 2019, at 19:50 I was outside on my deck watching the sky. I saw a red round object over my house.  This is the third time I've seen it.  On all occasions I was able to videotape the events. The object moved slowly over going from the south to the northern sky.  It would sometimes disappear & then reappear.  I videotaped it the entire time. I could see that it would grow dim & then get brighter.  At approximately 19:52 it grew very bright, then expelled an object.  I thought it looked like red water.  I saw all of this without a telescope, unaided with my own eyes.  The object that was expelled was also red, then dropped straight down & disappeared.  It is visible on my Apple I phone. When I reviewed the video on my phone, I could see the object that was expelled was round & red.  My phone has the ability to enlarge the area & it is clearly round, red, & came out of the original object. The red light then moved more to the north & was level with the trees up the street from my house. It went behind the trees & didn't reappear. I am studying astronomy & have spent countless hours outside.  What I saw was not a drone, was silent, with no moving parts or flashing lights.  I showed it to a United Airlines pilot & he told me to report to the UFO center.  He said it was nothing he'd ever seen & couldn't identify it.;42.4889;-123.1587
