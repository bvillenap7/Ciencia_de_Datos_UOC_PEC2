I told them I was checking out this bright light, I put the object in my binculars and saw something I have never seen before in my life it was disk shape with 4 panels of lights two on top and two on the bottom, at that thime I grab my wife out the door and showed her she said  oh my god what is it, at time the object moved to our right and followed the ground on the mountain you could see like a beam or light from the bottom of it you could see this with your eyes you did not need the binculars to see it. the object followed the ground to the top of the ridge it went over the top of the ridge and stop just on the other side of it it stayed there for about 5 min then it was gone. at that time my son yelled look to the right and this object was moving left,right up and down with such speed I never seen anything be able to move like that it was not a helicopter or plane there was no sound what so ever.
