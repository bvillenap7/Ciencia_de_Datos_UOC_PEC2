Five Red Triangle Ufo's over the Columbia River.;2013-02-19 21:00:00;10 minutes;Five Red Triangle Ufo's over the Columbia River. My Son called from town and asked me to look in the sky over the river. There were many people in town that were watching what appeared to be 5 objects in the night sky.   What we saw were 5 red triangle shaped objects also out our backyard over the Columbia river. They were coming toward us at a slow rate of speed and no sound.   The objects would draw close to each other and then away until 3 of them went straight up and behind cloud cover.  We video taped the whole event from start to finish.;45.671;-121.8686
