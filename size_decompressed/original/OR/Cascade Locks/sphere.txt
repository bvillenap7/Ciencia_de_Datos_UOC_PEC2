While driving home from college from Oregon to Montana, I was in the area of Cascade Locks, Oregon going down the highway at about 55 mph.  I glanced up to my right and noticed a perfect silver sphere in the sky next to some hills that I estimate were about 1,700-2,000 ft high.  The sphere was closer to 1,000 ft up in the air and it was moving quickly, but in the opposite direction of me and behind a hill.  I sped up my car in able to keep looking at it before the hill obstructed my view, but it was moving very quickly and I lost it behind the hill.  I saw it for about 7-8 seconds total. My best estimate for the size of this sphere is 2.5 meters in diameter (roughly the size of one of those “human hamster balls”).  It looked like a perfect sphere and I did not see any kind of string attached to it.  It didn’t leave any kind of trail and it didn’t have any lights, windows or wings that I could see. It was opaque and light silver in color. One observer: 21-year-old female college student traveling from Oregon to Montana;45.671;-121.8686
