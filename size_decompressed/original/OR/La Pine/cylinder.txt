Unexplainable object in the late morning sky on All Spirits Day, 2012;2012-10-31 10:00:00;5 minutes;unexplainable object in the late morning sky on All Spirits Day, 2012 I stopped to take a few pics of the moon and autumn colors.  There in the clouds was a little light, and in less than it takes to click a second time, the object was well below the clouds.  And then gone.  The images I captured have zero pixel manipulation and are of something I cannot identify.   Images have been sent UFOcntr ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) It was 836 pm, sorry my mistake. I was driving and facing east towards the mountains. I did not call anyone and you are the only person I have contacted via your site.  ((Sentence deleted to maintain privacy of witness.
