UFO enters atmosphere in fireball and flys away erratically.;2001-07-22 22:30:00;30 seconds;UFO enters atmosphere in fireball and flys away erratically. My friend and I were camping in Newberry Crater, outside of La Pine, Oregon at East Lake.  This is off of Highway 97.  I am a 17 year old male and my friend is an 18 year old male.  We were sitting on the dock of the lake and at about 10:30 PM, I noticed up in the SSE part of the sky a bright flash and a Orange fireball appeared about 1/12 the size of a full moon.  The fireball lasted about 10 seconds while leaving a small trail of orange and a orange haze around it.  My friend noticed it about 5 seconds after I had.  It then changed just in to an extremely bright star looking craft and zigzagged and swerved for about another 30 seconds or so until it disappeared over the horizon.  The craft didn't seem to have any sort of pattern to its flight path.  It went north and just was flying erratically.  I have seen 2 other sightings in hte past.  Neither where the craft actually entered the atmosphere.  There is no way that this could of been any sort of spacerock.  The object entering the atmosphere was too big and it was moving after it went through the atmosphere.  To my knowledge this could not have been any sorty of human made craft because after going through the atmosphere it wasn't flying straight.  Also I don't know why an human made craft would enter our atmosphere, or leave it over Oregon, because there is no aerospace base nearby.;43.7095;-121.5145
