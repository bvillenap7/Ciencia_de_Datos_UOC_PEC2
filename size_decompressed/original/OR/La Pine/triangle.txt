I could clearly see a dark black triangle shape with a curved stern this craft had to be at about 12000 ft since I am at about 4200 ft here.there was no sound and it was moving very slowly all of the sudden,the lights quit strobeing and a strait line apeared amindships and it doubled and the tripled its speed without a sound and disapeared to the SSE in less than ten seconds.;43.7095;-121.5145
