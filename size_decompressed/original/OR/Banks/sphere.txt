SR-71's over Washington County? I dont think so!;2007-10-19 15:00:00;8 Seconds;SR-71's over Washington County?  I dont think so! Just after 3:00pm today, I was smoking a cigarette with a good friend and burning paper garbage outside, when what I thought was thunder clapping overhead, I looked up and saw two extremely fast moving objects together pass right over my house at just under cloud cover (pretty high). The thunder noise, like a sonic boom lasted about 7 seconds afterwards then nothing except faint brown trails.  With my extensive knowledge on aviation, I'd say they looked alot like SR-71's, but I know for a fact that, that aircraft is no-longer flying and wouldn't be flying under cloud cover this time of day even if it were. Has anyone else seen these?;45.6496;-123.1197
