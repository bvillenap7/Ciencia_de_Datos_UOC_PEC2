Very large bright orb lighting up the entire surroundings.  Then suddenly gone.;2014-08-09 04:04:00;10 minutes;Very large bright orb lighting up the entire surroundings.  Then suddenly gone. I woke up because of a bright light out of the window and saw an orb through the trees.   I got up and was looking at it closely.  It looked like the moon, but was too low and on the opposite side of the house of where it usually is.   I went through the house looking our several windows to get a better look.  It was behind the trees but lighting up the entire yard.   I dismissed it and went back to bed.   A few minutes later the light disappeared.;45.6496;-123.1197
((HOAX??))  Multiple flying objects with lights flashing, that stoped in a specific spot.;2015-02-06 07:30:00;1 hour;Multiple flying objects with lights flashing, that stoped in a specific spot. The first object seen was fairly large and could easily be mistaken as a helicopter but was soon followed by two more flying objects.  They traveled left and circled around a hill for a few minutes.  We soon realized they had disappeared.  Then another came from the right and flew to the same hill.   This happened multiple times for about an hour.   Suddenly, three more surrounded the one flying object and they all flew to that same hill.  It may have gone longer but I left the scene.

Orb shaped object in south eastern sky over Oregon.  ((NUFORC Note:  Lens flare.  PD));2015-06-16 08:05:00;1 minute;Orb shaped object in south eastern sky over Oregon. This is the first UFO I ever saw,  HOWEVER, I didn't see THIS one with my naked eye.  I spotted it later in the pictures I had taken of some chemtrails in the sky. This craft was in the south-eastern sky.  I didn't hear anything at the time.  Since I can't tell you anymore than what is in the pictures, I will send them along. I have WAY less faith in this sighting than my second sighting in the same section of sky 8 days later (report already filed but I don't have pictures of that craft). ((NUFORC Note:  Lens flare, caused by pointing a camera at a bright source of light.  PD));45.6496;-123.1197
