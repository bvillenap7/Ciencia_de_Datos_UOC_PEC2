I saw what looked like stars appearing far in the distance, about four of them and then it looked like they were flashing on and off. It was a very clear night and the moon was out and visability was good. I could see the mountains in the background and they were below the objects.  All at once the bright white lights shut off and then re-appeared over the town which was about two miles ahead of me.  Four to five of the lights flashed off and on and were about 300 to 400 feet off of the ground.  Suddenly about fifteen of them appeared in two separate rows with the lower row about 300 feet over the town and the second row about 400 ft.  They stopped flashing and they all just lit up at the same time.  They stretched out to the south side of town for about half a mile.  I got within less than a mile of them and they all shut off at once and disappeared.  This is the third time I have seen activity in this area and decided that it was time to start reporting it.
