Ball of orange light over Mount Hebo, OR;1989-07-01 01:00:00;10-15 seconds;Ball of orange light over Mount Hebo, OR I remember this night so vividly and it is probably my most distinct memory of all time.  A friend and I were camping in my back yard one night in the summer of 1989 (I think). When everyone at my house had gone to sleep we snuck out of the yard to wander the neighborhood.  After a while we stopped near this building, I think it was a public restroom.  We were on the eastern side of this building with our backs to the wall and in front of us was Mount Hebo.  This is a small mountain that sits to the east of the small town.  As we were looking up a ball of orange light passed directly over us and slowly moved in a straight line until it went over the mountain.  It made no sound at all and had to be big and high in the sky to go over the mountain like it did.  We both looked at each other and ran home immediately.
