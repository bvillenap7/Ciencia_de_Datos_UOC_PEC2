Hovering blue/red/green lights in triangle;2014-08-28 01:30:00;1 hour;Hovering blue/red/green lights in triangle I was outside, on the phone with my girlfriend, when at one point I noticed a group of lights (one green, one red, one blue) arranged in a triangle formation. It was moving from left to right across the sky. Then this object slowed down until it was still in the sky. After sitting in the same position for about 20 minutes, it moved slowly left and then back right at half the distance. The lights seemed to be getting dimmer now at which point I thought the object might be heading away from Earth. The light was still there, smaller, but looking at a guide, the position of the light is where the star Capella sits.  I pulled my brother out of our apartment at this time so he could see this.
