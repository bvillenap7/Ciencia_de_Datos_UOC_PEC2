This craft was seen to the South or Monmouth, Oregon, possibly located in Benton County to the North or Corvallis, Oregon. The craft held still for 30-60 seconds at which time it slowly moved to the West a very slight distance (possibly 20 yards). The lights were located along the side (I saw four) rounded lights, along with a luminating bottom on the craft. Light illuminated around the craft slightly and the round lights appeared to be white or yellow. It was dark outside and this was not a star. It was clearly a UFO, not any airplane or helicoptor.;44.8371;-123.246
