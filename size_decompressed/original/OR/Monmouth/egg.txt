A white balloon gives off a bright blue light and disappears along with the balloon.;2015-12-31 15:00:00;10 seconds;A white balloon gives off a bright blue light and disappears along with the balloon. I was driving at 3 PM when I saw what looked like a white balloon in the sky.  It was a clear blue sky, and I wrote it off as someone releasing a balloon after a birthday party, or something like that.  However, the object was interesting to look at, and so I kept staring.  I had no obstructions to my vision. Five seconds after I saw the object, a blue light started to grow, about twice or three times as big as a planet or large star in the night sky.  The balloon shape was growing smaller as the light was getting brighter.  The blue light got brightest two seconds after the light began to glow, and then the light started to grow smaller and less intense, as if attached to an object that was traveling away from me, and two seconds later, it was gone. Who am I?  I am a Russian major at a college in the Midwest.  I have believed in UFOs, but never thought I would see one.  I am incredibly curious as to what it was.
