Spherical, white light shoots left and right in Oregon sky.;2010-09-22 22:55:00;1 minute;Spherical, white light shoots left and right in Oregon sky. I was leaving work. While I was walking to my car, I noticed the full moon and I looked up to see it.  I saw a spherical,white point of light in the sky very high up moving slowly.  I called my to my co-worker to come out and see it (I thought it might be an aircraft or satellite).  The object suddenly shot sharply to the left while moving very, very fast.  Then came back the to the right and stood still. Then, after standing very still, it shot over the horizon and out of site.  Both my coworker and I saw it.  It was surreal. I've never seen anything like it. It was very strange.;45.5317;-123.0462
Seven bright golden/amber orbs over Cornelius, OR moving N to SE, no sound, semi-formation.;2012-08-25 21:05:00;30 seconds;Seven bright golden/amber orbs over Cornelius, OR moving N to SE, no sound, semi-formation. August 25, 2012, just after 9pm we spotted 6 very bright, golden/amber orbs flying in a random group N to SE.  A 7th appeared slightly lagging behind.  Four then flew into a diamond shape formation with two flying out to each side of the 4 and the last continued to bring up the tail end. There was no sound and they appeared to move very, very fast until they simply flickered out in the distance…  At the same time we also observed an airplane flying in a lower and slightly different   trajectory at the same time.  It was clear that the lights were not any type of aircraft we’d ever seen before. We called Washington County Non-Emergency to see if they had any information about US military exercises in our area.  They had none.  I will follow-up with calls to the Port of Portland the local authority for the Hillsboro Airport nearby to see if anything appeared on radar or they have knowledge of a military presence.;45.5317;-123.0462
