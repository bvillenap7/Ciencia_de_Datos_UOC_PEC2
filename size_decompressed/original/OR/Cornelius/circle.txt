Two looked like they were going to collide but one moved on the other side very quickly.  They had orange and red lights changing back and forth.  They moved from one side of the sky to the other within three seconds.  Then their lights started going out and then they were gone.  No sound or noise came from them either.;45.5317;-123.0462
5 orange orbs appeared in the southern sky, below cloud cover, and hung suspended for several minutes.;2015-05-16 21:50:00;several minutes;5 orange orbs appeared in the southern sky, below cloud cover, and hung suspended for several minutes. UFO reporting center,   Last Friday or Saturday (5-15/16-15) I think it was Saturday around 9:50pm, my wife called me outside to look at the southern sky.  Hanging suspended below the clouds were 3 orange orbs, a beautiful shade of orange.  These orbs hung suspended without moving and no noise.  Over several minutes each of these orbs, which were formed a roughly triangle formation, faded then blinked out.  As they faded they flattened out. Before the last one faded out two more appeared the western sky and slowly rose until they were in the same area as the first 3.  As they arrived the last of the first 3 faded out.  These two hung suspended, just as the first 3 did, with no noise until they flattened out and faded out. We live in Western Oregon.  Did anyone else report these orbs?  My wife called emergency dispatch and later a deputy called and talked with me about this but he wasn’t bright enough to spell ufo so I don’t think he believed me.
