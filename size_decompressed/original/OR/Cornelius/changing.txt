Flashing and streaking lights in the northwest sky near Cornelius, Or.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible star, we suspect.  PD));2012-07-26 01:45:00;Still going at 0322;Flashing and streaking lights in the northwest sky near Cornelius, Or. I walked out on to my front porch and was looking at the sky to the west to northwest, when I noticed a star like shape.  I thought it was a star or planet because it was changing colors from white, red, and blue.  Then I noticed many smaller lights would flash around and farther away.  Then it would change direction and do figure 8 like pattern with many lights flashing around it.  I would also notice streaks of light that would fly close to the main light or just fly in any direction.  I saw one small but very bright white streak that was much closer and just over the tree tops.  I have been watching them dance around the sky since 0145 and itâ€™s now 0345. The lights look to be very far off but not too high in the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible star, we suspect.  PD));45.5317;-123.0462
