4 lights moving South to North;2006-09-26 01:40:00;10 sec;4 lights moving South to North 4 fast moving lights.  No specific color. 1 light at each vertex (3), with 1 light centered on trailing edge (?).  See next.  . .   .  Moving South to North. Tranversed about 15 degrees of the sky in about 5 seconds, at about a 30 - 35 degree angle up from viewing location. Lights were dim, not much brighter than dimist star that can be see by the unassisted eye. Unknown altitude, distance or speed. No sound.  Lights held formation while in view (about 5 sec).  Felt they were moving fast, but without any distance or altitude information, unable to guess.  I do not believe they were birds because, there were no variations in the distance between the lights, nor brightness.  No sounds, so don't believe it was an airplane, unless a glider was flying at 1:30 AM, not likely. ((NUFORC Note:  The formation did not survive the transfer from our e-mail program to the database program.  PD));45.5317;-123.0462
