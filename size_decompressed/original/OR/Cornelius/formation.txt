Red lights (non-flashing) in line (no sound) high rate of speed 7-8 PM heading North bound Cornelius Oregon.;2016-01-02 19:00:00;8 seconds;Red lights (non flashing) in line (no sound) high rate of speed 7-8 PM heading North bound Cornelius, Oregon. Approx. six to seven red dots (not flashing) in a row equally spaced.  Moving at a high rate of speed with no sound heading North bound.   The red dots were not super bright but way to fast to be a plane/no navigational flashing lights again, no sound. Not sure what to think???  This was not normal by any means...
