I'm sure I saw a real alien aircraft!;2000-07-04 21:00:00;5-10seconds;I'm sure I saw a real alien aircraft! It was the 4th of July, I think in 2000. There were at least a couple hundred people spread out on the beach in Pacific City Or. to watch the fire works show at Cape Kiwanda. Just before dark we saw a light come down from the sky with unreal speed and pause way out on the horizan, then it zipped back up and out of sight. This thing traveled hundreds of miles in seconds! It was amazing! myself, my wife, my brother inlaw, and a stranger next to us all saw it. There is a good chance more people saw it, but it was only there for 5 to 10 seconds. I remember it as a white round light quite big considering how far away it was. At first I thought it was a falling star, but it was faster. Then it paused, and I was thinking what the heck! Then it zipped off! Nothing I have ever seen can move like that, It had to be an advanced life form for sure. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  He assumes it occurred in 2000.  PD));45.2088;-123.9595

The lights appeared separately from one another and took approximately 2-3 minutes from the time they first appeared to the time they became too distant to observe, approximately 2-5 minutes apart.  No sound was heard;45.2088;-123.9595
4 flashes of very bright focused light a few minutes apart.;2018-11-23 03:00:00;12 minutes;4 flashes of very bright focused light a few minutes apart. A bright light quickly flashed a large oval-shaped beam into my bedroom from a large window located up high on the south facing window.  The window sits between 17 and 20 feet above ground level.  It happened again around 3 minutes later.  It was so bright, and again focused in a large oval-like beam.  It flashed 2 more times for a total of 4 times within 10 minutes.;45.2088;-123.9595
A stacking column of lights;2020-12-04 19:00:00;1 minute;A stacking column of lights I noticed a stack of lights in the sky to the SWW over the Pacific Ocean. Spaced out like Orionâ€™s Belt. I noticed it and immediately mentioned it to my partner. As we watched the lights moved closer together in an upward motion stacking and upon reaching the upper most point of light disappearing into the darkness.;45.2088;-123.9595
