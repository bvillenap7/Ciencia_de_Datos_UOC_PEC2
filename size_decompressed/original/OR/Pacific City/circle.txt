Orange hovering light moving slowly then rapidly then gone into thin air;2013-08-30 21:25:00;<1 minute;Orange hovering light moving slowly then rapidly then gone into thin air looking at the small airport and looked up and saw over the ocean a bright round orange light that was moving eratically across the sky toward land making several quick movements forward back and side to side.  was not a sound at all and it was moving closer then stopped and then disappered instantly with no trace and there was not a cloud in the sky and stars behind it in the far off distance the way it dissapeared was a little freaking no plane or helecoptor or anything human could move that fast.  I grew up next to a marine base in calif and it was not a flare ive seen those off camp pendelton for thirty years this was unexplainable and very bright orange did not burn out or fade litterally moved away then gone poof.;45.2088;-123.9595
