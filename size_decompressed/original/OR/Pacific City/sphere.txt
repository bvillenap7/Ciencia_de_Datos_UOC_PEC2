Three lighted circular aircraft;1999-03-24 20:30:00;45 minutes;Three lighted circular aircraft My son and I were driving along hwy 101 at jct. of hwy 130 on the north central oregon coast. My son told me to stop to see some objects in the sky.  We turned easterly onto hwy 130 and stopped apprx. Â¼ mile form jct of hwy 101.  We stopped and got out of the car and saw an object with lights front and back.  After a few moments I realized it was three separate objects flying in tight formation. The objects were appproximately 5 to 10 feet in diameter and flying at about 1,500 to 2,000 feet. The lead object was a bright star color and appeared to be slightly larger than the two rear objects. The rear objects had an orange tint.  None of the objects made a sound. The objects came from the west off the ocean and traveled easterly over the Nestucca Bay and began to travel east up the Little Nestucca river.  As the objects became almost parallel with us, one of the rear objects did a 90 degree turn and headed south at a faster rate of speed than before. The other rear object also turned 90 degrees, but headed straight for us in a northly direction.  After traveling apprx. 1/8th of a mile and was directly above us it did another 90 degree turn and headed back westerly toward the ocean.  This object maintained a constant speed of 5 to 10 mph. The rear object that had headed south  was now apprx. 1 mile away.  Suddenly it mad a huge arc easterly, then across the path of the lead object, and then westerly, stopping  on a dime apprx. 5 feet behind the object that was traveling apprx 5 to 10 mph  heading back toward the ocean. The object that made the large arc traveled at least 2 miles in apprx 2 seconds.  In other words 3,600 to 4,000 mph. The two orange tinted objects continued to toward the ocean at apprx 5 to 10 mph. As they approached a thick fog band along the ocean, I turned my attention to the lead object which was still traveling easterly at apprx 5 to 10 mph.  As I was watching it, My son yelled that he saw a huge orange explosion in the fog bank. It lasted just a brief moment and had no sound. As we again turned our attention to the lead object, it started suddenly flashing very bright lights from underneath.  These bright flashed occurred apprx every 15 or 20 seconds.  It almost appeared as though it were taking photos of the ground. As the object continued easterly up the Little Nestucca river canyon (hwy 130), we decided to drive over to the coast at Pacific City to see if the fog bank had cleared for a view of the orange objects  which were now out over the ocean.  After apprx 15 minutes of driving, we realized that the fog bank was to thick for any visuals.  We then drove back to  hwy 130 and up the river to see if we could catch up with the lead object.  At apprx 6 miles up the river,  we encountered the object still flying at apprx 5 to 10 mph and flashing a bright light from underneath every 15 or 20 seconds.  We followed the object another mile, then stopped our pursuit.  One other note: Within a minute of when the two orange tinted objects entered the fog bank, we could hear 2, maybe 3 fighters jets flying very low and roaring up the coast line from the south.  We thought they might be chasing the orange objects.  There are no air force bases anywhere near this location and people who live in the area almost never here jet fighters flying around, especially at very low elevations. These objects appeared to be able to fly from 5 mph to 4,000 mph instantly and make 90 degree turns at will.  I  honestly do not believe humans have the capability to construct  these type of flying machines. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM SOURCE OF REPORT)) Correction to siting dated 3/20/1998 20:30 pacific city, oregon  After some discussion with my son (witness to event), we determined that the actual date of siting was either march 24th or march 25th 1999 rather than 1998 as previously reported.  Sorry for the error. ((END ADDENDUM));45.2088;-123.9595
