Orange sphere traveling south over st helens Oregon.;2013-07-07 22:00:00;60 seconds;Orange sphere traveling south over st helens Oregon We a round object traveling northwest to the south at a high altitude, maybe twenty to thirty thousand feet.  The color was orange and it seemed to vary or shift its color from light orange to darker orange, its direction maybe thirty degrees to a southern direction.  This object moved in a linear or straight path and it was not trailing anything, we watched it traveling south it started to disappear and light backup and then it dissappeared and it never made noise.   Hopefully someone can make sense out of this.;45.8582;-122.8314

There is a white strobing light, unlike one on a plane.  Too far in the distance to hear any noises.  Moves very quickly and jerks hard to the left and right.   About 22:43, it dropped suddenly and quickly and reappeared about ten minutes later.  The sight is continuing to be monitored.;45.8582;-122.8314
