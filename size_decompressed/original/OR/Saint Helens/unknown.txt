I was skywatching when I noticed one star moving slowly across the sky, imediatly thinking it was just a plane but there was no sound and the object began to speed up and then slow down and speed up again when a dimmer version of the same object came from the other direction and past the one I was tracking I watched it continue across the sky until it started getting dim and disapeared. I waited and watched until it came back, going the opposite direction with the same fast and then slow speeds, with still no aircraft sounds, until it stopped where it was and disapeared. I seen nothing after that.;45.8582;-122.8314
