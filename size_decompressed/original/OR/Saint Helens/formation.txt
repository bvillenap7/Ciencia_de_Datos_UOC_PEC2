They had bright flashing lights like cop cars!  Could see with a naked eye, but with Bino's, could clearly see flashing red green blue and yellow lights.   One larger orange oblong shape was extremely bright for awhile then shut the lights down but could still make out something.  None of these seemed to move very much.  Looked at a couple through the spotting scope and the actual flash of the lights illuminated in the scope.   We drove around for 1.5 hours to get a better look and watched them for 2 hours.  We could see a few over Scappoose also.   I found some videos on youtube of the same thing we seen.;45.8582;-122.8314
