Fast moving object that moved left to right, stopped, then right to center, then center to left at 1 minute intervals;2002-06-26 03:00:00;15 minutes;Fast moving object that moved left to right, stopped, then right to center, then center to left at 1 minute intervals I woke up around 3:00am, and looked out my bedroom window (Curtains open, seen from bed) and saw an object that measured about 1/16th of an inch, approximately 8 inches higher than my 9' aborvitae hedge, which is approximately 10' from the house. The object first caught my eye as a white light, speeding left to right. It stopped and i could see what appeared to be white lights rotating around the bottom. at first i thought it was a star. Then about 15 seconds later, it moved quite rapidly about 4 inches to the right and stopped. it stayed at this position for about 30 seconds, then moved rapidly right, back to its original position. this happened about 4 times. the object would first move right, then back to center, then left, then back to center. I watched it for about 15 minutes.;45.8582;-122.8314
