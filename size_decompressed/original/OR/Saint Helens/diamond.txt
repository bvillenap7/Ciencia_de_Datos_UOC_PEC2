Guessing was under 1000 ft.. Strange movement, jogs and jags.  Stayed close to the same area in the sky for a long period of time.  No noise and was above my home.  Guessing a drone of a sort.  Why it hung out in the same area for such a long time?  Would turn and light would dim and then turn and have a bright whitish blue light.  Shot some video.;45.8582;-122.8314
