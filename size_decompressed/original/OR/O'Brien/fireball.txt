Orange Orb rumbling UFO over coastal mountains in southern Oregon;2012-08-13 22:10:00;5 minutes;Orange Orb rumbling UFO over coastal mountains in southern Oregon Shortly after 10pm last night (about 10:10) husband and I (in lawn chairs stargazing, post Persied Shower- and still looking for “leftover shooting stars after a couple of good nights)  We BOTH saw an orange-orb rumbling UFO in the west about 40 degrees? up from the horizon....just high enough to be over local homes but behind tall trees.I saw it as orange my husband saw it as orange with a yellow halo. It was like a subtle audio-earthquake in the sky it was vibrating so much! It was moving slowmostly behind trees but I saw it stationary in a clear spot for just a few seconds.  Size about 3 X the Space station brightness and a nice glowing orange.  We’d heard it earlier and commented on how long and loud the “odd jet rumbling” was over the coastal mountains, going north, but then It Came Back and went south and that was when we saw it.Visually it slowly moved behind the trees on our property but we could see it between them many times for a minute more. We lis! tened to the rumbling for several minutes afterwards.I'm late 50s and college educated and my husband is a Vietnam veteran with two purple hearts. I'd seen a couple of other UFOs in my life but it was his first and he is quite astonished and thoughtful about it.;42.0882;-123.6907
