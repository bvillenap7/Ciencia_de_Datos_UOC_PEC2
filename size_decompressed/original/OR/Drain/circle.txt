Bright light flashes and shrinks before zipping off.;1995-06-12 23:00:00;est. 5 min.;Bright light flashes and shrinks before zipping off. My friend and I were sitting in her driveway in Drain, testing her new telescope. Clear night. My friend's cats started climbing all over us and we thought that was odd, because they usually hide when company is over. We couldn't get the tele. focused on anything very well, so I got up to see if I could find the moon, easier to focus on. I walk down the driveway and turn around and looked above the house. She had tall Douglas firs between her house and the road. Above the trees was a round white light. I asked her when they got a new street light and she said they didn't. So I asked her to look and tell me what the light was. It was NOT the moon. She said she had no clue what it was and grabbed the tele.  When she bent down to look at it through the tele. the 'light' (which was a bit smaller than the moon) flashed very brightly. My friend jerked her head back and held her hands over her eyes, saying the light had hurt them. Then the light shrunk to start size, zipped diagonally down and to the left and then took off way upinto the sky, where it continued to zigzag across the sky and then disappeared.
