My friend and I were trying out her new telescope. Couldn't get it to focus clearly. The pet cats were climbing all over us, and they usually don't want to cuddle with me, so I thought that was odd. I got up from my chair in the driveway and looked up above the tall, surrounding trees to see if I could find the moon, easier to focus on. I turned around to look behind us , and above the Douglas firs and the house was a bright white light. Complete circle, breifly thought it was the moon, but it had an electrical glow. I asked my friendwhat's that? She said she didn't know- not a lamp. She tried to focus on it with the telescope, and when she put her eye to the eyepiece the light flashed brightly. My friend jerked her head away and exclaimed that the light had hurt her eye. Then the light shrunk down to star size, zipped diagonally to the left. then took off up further into the sky and zig- zagged to the left and dissapeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
