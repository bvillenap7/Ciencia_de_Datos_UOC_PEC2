High altitude light turned, dropped several Thousand feet, turned and disappeared!;1997-10-01 21:30:00;1 minute;High altitude light turned, dropped several Thousand feet, turned and disappeared! Sitting on front porch looking up at stars and saw a light appearing as a high altitude (est 35-40,000 ft) aircraft traveling North to South, suddenly stopped, appeared to drop straight toward me (Basically just down,)for 10-20 seconds getting slightly bigger and brighter then at about (est) 20,000 ft stopped and turned south again and disappeared! Thought about it being a military aircraft, but the speed at which it changed directions seemed wrong! And as a general rule, military fighter aircraft don't operate white, steady glowing lights!;43.4565;-123.358
