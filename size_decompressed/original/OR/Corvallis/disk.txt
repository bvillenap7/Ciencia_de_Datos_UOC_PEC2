Flying grey disk over Corvallis,Or;2000-04-30 22:30:00;20-30 secs;Flying grey disk over Corvallis,Or 10:30 pm at night April 30,2000 a friend and I were walking accross the street in front of the Corvalla Apts. off of 5th street. We saw a grey disk come from the right at remarkable speed. It was moving up and down in a wave like motion. Then it stopped in mid air! It was under the lower part of the clouds because we could see it was grey and saucer shaped. It stopped, shot downward...hovered and wobbled.... (no noise) shot up...stopped... and continued on out of site. I have NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS! My friend was in the Airforce and agreed that he never saw anything like it. This was too big for a bird and way too fast.This could not be a plane because it stopped in mid air, and there were no lights on it. This was definately a UFO. I feel so fortunate I was able to witness this.;44.5724006666667;-123.272947333333
Saucer with lights that wobbled up and down but in straight line across the dusk sky.;2008-07-14 21:15:00;2 minutes;Saucer with lights that wobbled up and down but in straight line across the dusk sky. Walking with a friend when  I saw this.  Unable to tell the height or size.  We thought it was a toy or balloon at first, but there were odd lights on the rim of top and bottom.  Both of us were completely puzzled by what we were seeing.  We watched it travel a great distance until it was out of sight.  It moved in too straight a line for wind or remote control to carry it,  though it appeared to wobble.;44.5724006666667;-123.272947333333
