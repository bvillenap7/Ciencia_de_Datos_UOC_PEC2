White, illuminated cresent seen at high velocity, lit up cloud, no sound.;2000-07-05 22:15:00;1-2 seconds;White, illuminated cresent seen at high velocity, lit up cloud, no sound. I saw the object, which was a completely luminous white crescent, to the north of me fly from east to west.  I caught it out of the corner of my eye.  It happened so fast!  I wish I could have viewed it longer.  Anyways, it made no sound and it never changed color.  It partially illumnated a cloud bank as it flew into it.  As I said, it was shaped like a crescent, but the lower end was shorter, giving it the look of a cuvry boomerang at an etreme angle.  People tell me, It must be a rocket, or a jet afterburner, but I know it wasn't.  I used to live in St. Cloud FL. and see the space shuttle lift off, illuminating the whole horizon and jet planes flying overhead, heading to and from the air force base.  I know that it wasn't a plane or a rocket or anything else. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));44.5724006666667;-123.272947333333

My cousin, Fiance, Daughter and My Cousins Girlfriend Left Newport, Oregon and accidentally headed North along the coastline when we we;2015-06-06 00:06:00;15 minutes;My cousin, fiance, daughter and my cousin’s girlfriend left Newport, Oregon, and accidentally headed north along the coastline, when we were followed by, I think, a jeep.  I don't remember clearly.  It wouldn't turn its brights off, and there wasn't a spot to pull off until we hit a city we dubbed Creepsville, in a joking manner. We eventually hit a small convenient store, where we could pull over and smoke a cigarette. We talked and decided that we missed a turn to go back to Redmond, Oregon.  So we went back towards Newport and wasted time and gas going that direction, and getting to Newport, we stopped at a gas station, where I filled up on gas and went to the atm.  Afterwards we smoked another cigarette off to the side of the gas station and witnessed something in the sky.  My cousin pointed it out before anyone we looked and I wasn't very impressed, considering I didn't feel like I needed to be at the time, for the fact that 3 people had been witnessing it besides me.  It looked like a lantern, floating in the sky high out above the ocean, heading towards us.   It was flickering and looked like the wind was trying to blow it out, rather like a signal flare, but it went out in a way it couldn't have been one.   We drove into the woods towards Corvallis, Oregon.  Upon leaving Newport, my fiancé asked what the time was, and I answered with 12:01 like midnight.  My cousin and I started to talk about mythological creatures, as well as urban legends, like zombies, and other things.  I don't remember talking about stuff towards the point where we hit a small power station.  The only thing I remember is a house between there, and Corvallis.  The last thing I saw was a sign that said “12:21 Corvallis,” and I got a chill because it is impossible to travel to from Newport to Corvallis in 20 minutes.  A time lapse happened. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the source of the report, and she seemed to us to be sincere in her description of the alleged events.  PD));44.5724006666667;-123.272947333333
