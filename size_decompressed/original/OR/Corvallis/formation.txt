Multi-Colored Flashing Light with Reddish-orange orb moving across sky.;2012-10-03 03:00:00;ongoing;Multi-Colored Flashing Light with Reddish-orange orb moving across sky. First observed what appeared to be a single multi-colored flashing light, which upon observation seemed to become 4 separate blinking lights which seemed to drop down or separate than return to one point.   Next we observed a reddish-orange orb or ball that moved from the far left crossing right across sky towards blinking multi-colored light then  disappeared as soon as it 'arrived' at the point of the flashing lights.  We next observed a bright white light which appeared directly above us, that eventually shifted to a greenish color.  Through-out this time we began to notice similar multi-colored flashing lights appear in circular vicinity of white light.    We went inside and upon returning 15 minutes later, found that there appeared to than be a formation in a sort of U shape consisting of 2-4 of the flashing lights and saw that the white/green orb/light had now shifted/moved upward & to the North of its previous position.   Also original multi-colored flash! ing light repetitive rate has greatly increased.  As a side note, through out the encounter, we had the sensation of interacting/being observed. FYI  I have some poor quality video from my cell phone that i can submit if needed.;44.5724006666667;-123.272947333333
