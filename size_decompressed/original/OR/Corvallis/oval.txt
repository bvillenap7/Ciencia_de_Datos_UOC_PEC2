Oblong object wheel paddle style attached to rectangular tall object.;2019-10-26 14:33:00;7 seconds;Oblong object wheel paddle style attached to rectangular tall object. As I sat down at the swing to rest my foot, I decided to swing back and looked up into the sky, I saw above a very tall tree way up in the sky, a bring silver object that was like a wheel paddle oval shaped attached to a tall darker silver rectangular shape upright, these were attached together, the paddle style wheel was circling slow, it was bright silver, there were no planes or any other objects above the tree, I did the same swing motion and as I was watching the object, it flew straight up and disappeared.  There was no sound in the sky, except for a family next to the playground that were busy carving pumpkins and grilling food.  My children were playing on the slide and I ran to look behind the tall tree to make sure, it was not there.;44.5724006666667;-123.272947333333
