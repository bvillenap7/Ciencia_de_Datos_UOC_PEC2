Neon green fireball trailing orange-red tail visible less than 10 seconds, moving NNW above Corvallis, OR.;2000-02-21 19:43:00;< 10 sec;Neon green fireball trailing orange-red tail visible less than 10 seconds, moving NNW above Corvallis, OR. Witnessed a neon green fireball about the size of a pencil eraser held at arm's length as it traversed about 30-40 degrees of sky.  Soundless in its passage and no sonic boom.  Heard jet aircraft engine sounds from the N approx. 30 seconds after the object disappeared moving toward the NNW. Travelling in a straight line, it trailed a red-orange tail.  It did not leave any contrail or sparks in its path.  It did not appear to to be giving off sparks or breaking up.  Total length of object and colored trail equal to a fist's width at arm's length. Out for a cigarette and watching the night sky, the object caught my peripheral vision as it brightly flared into existence to the SE of Corvallis about 70 degrees above the horizon.  It flashed overhead passing to the East of Corvallis and winked out about 30 degrees above the northern horizon. Total viewing time was less than 10 seconds.  Just a question of being in the right place at the right time. J. Allen Hynek was my astronomy professor at Northwestern University in 1963 and I've enjoyed Peter's reports over the years.  Keep up the good work.  Hope this helps.;44.5724006666667;-123.272947333333
What may have been another Corvallis fireball lit the night sky for 10 seconds above the cloud deck at 2254 PDT.;2000-04-17 22:54:00;10 seconds;What may have been another Corvallis fireball lit the night sky for 10 seconds above the cloud deck at 2254 PDT. What may have been a repeat of the 2/21/00 Corvallis, OR fireball event occured at 2254 PDT on Monday, April 17.  About one-fourth of the night sky was illuminated with a series of rapid, strobe-like pulses of greenish light above the cloud cover.  Definitely greenish, not blue-white like lightning or sheet lightning.  No thunderclap or any aircraft sounds.  The light source moved from south to north along a line paralleling Interstate 5, east of Corvallis.  Thick, broken clouds prevented any direct view, but the multiple green flashes were distinctly brighter than the moon which was south and east at the time of the sighting.  Estimate base of broken cloud cover at approx. 6,000 feet.  Winds W-SW variable at 10-20 mph. This sighting was similar to the February fireball in terms of the definite greenish cast and the fact that it suddenly flashed into view, i.e. the immediate, lightning-bright flash above the cloud layer, and that tonight's whatever it was traveled what seems to have been the same south-to-north trajectory.  At least three or four distinct, bright green flashes against a bright green glow that covered at least 25 percent of the sky for about 10 seconds.;44.5724006666667;-123.272947333333
A bright spherical object moved across the sky in daylight, then appeared to split into multiple bright lights.;2000-12-05 16:20:00;20 minutes;A bright spherical object moved across the sky in daylight, then appeared to split into multiple bright lights. About 4:20 pm I saw what looked like a star at about 75 degrees altitude just west of north.  It was still broad daylight, so I thought maybe it was an Iridium flare.  But the object didn't appear to be moving in the sky, and it didn't fade out. I got out my spotting scope.  At 45X magnification it appeared larger, as though it was much closer and/or bigger than a star.  It looked like a thick ring of light with a darker center, but that may have been something to do with the scope's optics.  It moved out of my scope's field of vision pretty quickly, so it was moving after all. At about 4:40 pm it was WNW at about 30 degrees altitude.  I lost sight of it for a second, then I'm almost certain what I saw next was the same object:  I saw about 10-15 tiny but bright sparkles, as though the object had exploded.  The sparkles were just points of light.  Then I lost sight of that in the scope.  I couldn't see anything unusual with my naked eye any more. Since I had not changed the focus between seeing the single object and the multiple points of light, and the multiple points appeared tiny, I assume my scope was in focus when viewing the single object.;44.5724006666667;-123.272947333333
Fireball ?;2001-01-22 18:20:00;2 seconds;Fireball ? I was driving west on hwy 34 at about 6:20 p.m. when a white dot (fireball?) came by from east to west.

Fireball Sighted by Child in the Northwest;2001-04-09 22:00:00;6-8 seconds;Fireball Sighted by Child in the Northwest I am reporting this for my nine-year-old daughter who calmly relayed this information to me the following morning. I would like to note that we do not discuss UFO topics with her, and therefore I seriously doubt that she would have dreamed this up on her own, infact I was struck by the amount of information and details that she related to me. We are guessing the time to be around 10:00 PM she had been lying in her bed looking out the window when she saw a bright ball of fire streaking across the sky.  She said the round object was very bright with orange and red colored flames or sparks coming off the back of it, and moving very fast, faster than an airplane, and made no sound. From her description, the direction seemed to be east to west.;44.5724006666667;-123.272947333333
White orb sighting over Corvallis Oregon moving slowly from west to east.;2008-07-30 22:30:00;30 sec;White orb sighting over Corvallis Oregon moving slowly from west to east. On the night of July 30th I was waiting for my girlfriend to show up at her new apartment on Grove Street in Corvallis.  I was laying on the hood of my pickup watching the sky.  After about 5 minutes of waiting I became bored and jumped down off the hood and just happened to glance in a northern direction toward OSU.  I noticed a very bright white light that appeared to be very high moving very slowly from west to east. The light was white with a sort of reddish/orangeish hue around the edges, and it was shaped like an orb.  I watched it for almost 30 seconds and it then it just got dimmer until it vanished.  I talked to a buddy of mine and he thinks it could of been just a meteor, that could explain how it got gradually dimmer and then vanished. Also of note about 5 minutes after this occurred I was watching the sky in the general direction that it disappeared and I noticed what looked like an object with orange lights rotating around it, heading south at a high rate of speed.  I lost sight of this one as it flew behind a tree and I only saw it for about 3 seconds.  I will admit I was pretty excited at this point and this could have been an airplane, especially since there was an airport in its general direction of travel and it was fairly low. One more thing a light aircraft, looked like a twin engine Cessna, passed from south to north about 3 minutes before my initial sighting of the orb.;44.5724006666667;-123.272947333333

Was moving and an extreme high rate of speed. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));44.5724006666667;-123.272947333333
