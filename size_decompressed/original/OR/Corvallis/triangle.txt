On the peak night of the perseid meteor showers, my husband and I were out back shortly before midnight watching the celestial event.   About 30 minutes into our stargazing, I noticed what I thought to be a satellite heading due east.  I then noticed a second point of light, traveling in unison with the first point of light.  As I began to think this was unusual, I noticed the third point of light, forming a triangle.   They were all moving perfectly in unison together.  The area between the points of light was black, but it was definitely a solid mass of some sort as it was covering up clusters of stars.   I saw it turn--it appeared to be entering our galaxy from another dimension given how it turned.  As it banked to head SE, the perception of the triangle shaped craft changed.  We watched it as it headed over our house, disappearing behind a large tree.  We ran out into the street but due to the street lights (or perhaps it just disappeared), we lost it.   According to my husband, the back end appeared to be square.  An amazing AWESOME experience!  It was obviously very large given how far up it was.  It was absolutely silent.  If you were to measure it holding your hand up against the sky, using your fingers, it was a good 6 inches by 3.5.   What is even more amazing is that we saw the very same shaped craft at the Oregon Coast (Yachats) in the early spring of 2001 (approximation), only this time the craft was much lower and we could see a flash of light in the center of it as a red ball of light flew out.    And as it flew overhead, the streetlights flickered and briefly went out until the craft literally just vanished as it headed due east over the coast range.  You could feel a strange sensation as it went overhead--it was like massive amounts of electricity crawling over your skin--like we were in a giant electrical field.   So to be blessed not just once but twice is totally cool!  With this last visit, we were standing outside, calling for it to land and pop in, have a visit......share a coke or something.  :) ((NUFORC Note:  At first, we wondered whether the witnesses might have observed the three satellites that are seen, from time to time, to fly in formation, thought to be part of the U. S. Navy NOSS satellite system.   However, if the triangle of lights indeed blocked out the stars inside its periphery, then the formation could not have been caused by three orbiting satellites.

Dark, triangular-shaped, single object with no lighting, making no sound, moving rapidly across sky;2007-12-08 18:45:00;5-6 seconds;Dark, triangular-shaped, single object with no lighting, making no sound, moving rapidly across sky 6:45pm Saturday, December 08, 2007  Corvallis, Oregon  About 6:45 pm, I took my dog out to the back yard to do her thing. It was already dark by this time, so I looked up into the sky, to view the stars. The night sky was clear, with no clouds, fog, or haze. Moments after looking up and admiring the stars, I noticed what I at first thought was a flight of geese, or birds of some sort that fly in a V formation. The object or formation was very faint against the dark sky, and thinking it was a flock of birds, I continued to watch and listen for their honking sound. Instead, I heard no sound at all. The object was moving from northeast, to southeast and I immediately noted that it was moving at a very high rate of speed, too fast for birds. As the object passed directly overhead, its outline became more apparent, but was still very faint, and almost blended with the sky. As it passed between my position, and a group of stars, I was able to see that it was in fact a solid or at least, a contiguous object (not a flock of birds). It resembled the shape of a stealth bomber, or something like it. There were no visible lights on the object. Another curious fact about this occurrence was that the object made no sound whatsoever. If it was a stealth bomber, I would have expected to hear jet engine noise, or some faint sound, but I heard nothing. The object appeared to be flying at an altitude of perhaps 5,000 feet above ground level, estimated by its relative size in the sky, and the rate at which it moved. From the time I first observed the object, it was at about a 60 degree angle overhead. It passed directly over my house, and I was able to see the faint outline for approximately 5-6 seconds, and then it completely faded as it moved southwest.;44.5724006666667;-123.272947333333
3 red lights in triangle formation. Slightly broke shape, 1 disappeared behind clouds.
