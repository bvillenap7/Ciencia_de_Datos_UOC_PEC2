Not a shooting star, not an aircraft, quiet, green, large, and materialized out of thin air.;2001-02-26 01:25:00;three seconds;Not a shooting star, not an aircraft, quiet, green, large, and materialized out of thin air. I am an engineering student at Oregon State University It was late night and I did not see anyone else on the streets (which does not rule out that no one else saw it, OSU is a big school) I just finished up my report at the computer lab. As I walked towards my dorm a light suddenly appeared in the sky (in the direction I was facing). It appeared to be losing altitude fast, and after about three seconds my view of it was obscured by the buildings. I had the fortune of gazing in it's direction when it appeared, so I had complete focus on it.  Though it was late night I was not tired. I ruled out a shooting star For one it was a very large light (half the size of a full moon), and neon green (how cliche). It also traversed alot of sky for a shooting star. I also ruled out an aircraft It appeared suddenly in midair, and was completely silent in it's descent. There appeared to be a shape to it, but the light was too intense to make out any detail.;44.5724006666667;-123.272947333333
