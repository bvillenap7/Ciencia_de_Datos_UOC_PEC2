Me and a friend were watching a movie at a sleepover, when we saw a flashing orange light traveling at an abnormally slow speed, almost hovering. We went outside to investigate, and the shadow in between flashes had a triangular shape with a gap in the bottom.  After observing for several minutes it suddenly disappeared. It was quite the sight.;44.5724006666667;-123.272947333333
