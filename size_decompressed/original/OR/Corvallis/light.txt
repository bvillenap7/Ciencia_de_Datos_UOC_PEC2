We had just pulled onto Interstate 5 from leaving Corvallis when we saw these three amber/orange lights hovering above the freeway.  At;1997-11-13 01:45:00;20 minutes;We had just pulled onto Interstate 5 from leaving Corvallis when we saw these three amber/orange lights hovering above the freeway.  At first we thought we were seeing street lamps or something, but when we realized that we were about to pass underneath them we pulled over immediately.  The sky was full of clouds which gave us a good idea of how low they were, and the wind was blowing fierce enough to push anything around that might have been floating...but these things weren't moving at all.  We couldn't believe that nobody else was pulling over to watch these things.  There was a trucker about 100 yards ahead of us that had pulled over, but that was it.  Eventually, two of the lights moved off to the right over a field while the other one remained stationary over the interstate (we were in the south bound lanes by the way). As the two lights began moving over this field they began dropping some kind of glowing red objects.  The objects would fade out before they hit the ground but they continued to drop them at a rate of about 2-3 per minute and did this for about 10 minutes.  Then they stopped and the one hovering obove the freeway joined them and they moved north and up until they were above the clouds.  That was the most amazing thing I have ever seen and I wish I would have had a camera on me.  All my friends who saw it freaked out to the point of denial, trying to make up excuses as to what they could have been.  One guy even convinced himself that they were parachuters with some kind of fan that kept them aloft and could move them in any direction they desired.  One more detail, there was absolutely no sound coming from the lights.  All we could that night were the freeway sounds and the wind.;44.5724006666667;-123.272947333333
Explosion of white light followed by the radio turning to static;2002-07-10 20:00:00;1 minute;Explosion of white light followed by the radio turning to static This occurred late at night during the summer of 2002 . My best friend at the time and I had just graduated high school, and were cruising around Corvallis in her mom's van, smoking cigarettes, listening to music, and talking. After some time had passed she eventually turned onto highway 20 toward Albany. It is a rural two-lane highway, and there is nothing really besides a lot of farm land and some houses between the two cities. For reference, the Willamette River is approximately half a mile from where we were on the highway when this event occurred.  Shortly after we turned onto highway 20, an explosion of bright white light appeared on the right hand side, far into the distance. We were driving past a flat area of farm land at that moment, and I could see that the light appeared to come from the horizon. As soon as this happened the radio turned to static for several seconds. A couple of seconds after the radio came back on there was an even larger explosion of white light, and the radio went out for approximately 30 seconds. We were terrified at this point, and immediately turned around and went to her place. I never found out what the source of the light was.;44.5724006666667;-123.272947333333
Round, white light  with halo effect appeared briefly in the vicinity of the Big Dipper on clear, cold night..;2007-03-22 22:15:00;one-half second;Round, white light  with halo effect appeared briefly in the vicinity of the Big Dipper on clear, cold night.. Small white light with halo effect observed near Dubhe, (the lower star at the outside edge of the Big Dipper’s inverted cup.) It was a cold night and the sky was perfectly clear, with the Moon setting low on the western horizon. I was outside looking at the sky in the area of the Big Dipper’s cup when a round, white light suddenly turned on just to the left (west) of Dubhe in a horizontal line with the star. (I was facing North.) The light was visible for about one-half second and had a distinct halo around it. Other stars in the sky exhibited no halo effect, including the setting Moon. The light remained in the exact same position during the entire time it was visible. For comparison, the light was roughly the size of a nickel held at arm’s length. When viewed with the naked eye, the light appeared to be about twice as large as the star Dubhe and roughly twice as bright. Its duration was brief, but the light was steady in appearance while it lasted. It did not flash or fade in and out--it simply turned on, showed a halo effect, and turned off.  After the light disappeared, I held my hand against the sky to estimate its distance from the star Dubhe. It was about three fingers distance from Dubhe in a horizontal line to the left of the star. I couldn’t estimate the altitude of the light with any accuracy. It seemed to be at a great distance from me and gave me the impression that it might be beyond the earth’s atmosphere in space, but it was clearly visible.  I retrieved my binoculars from inside and swept the whole sky in every direction to see if I could detect another light like it, but I saw nothing unusual for over an hour. I served in the military and am familiar with all sorts of military and commercial aircraft and their navigational lights and I recognize satellites when I see them. The light I saw was not like those objects. Most commercial aircraft uses a flight pattern well to the East of my town and we do not see military aircraft here on a regular basis. Our night sky is very quiet. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));44.5724006666667;-123.272947333333
Round yellow-orange flickering light descended from the sky to the stadium.;2011-04-11 22:00:00;Seconds;Round yellow-orange flickering light descended from the sky to the stadium. A light went down into Reser Stadium. The light was yellow-orange round, and I saw it flicker as it descended slowly. I lost sight of it because of my angle of sight through my window, but it looked too close to have gone on the other side of the stadium.

White light far brighter than satellite drifts overhead and vanishes.  ((NUFORC Note:  Overflight of ISS??  PD));2011-08-14 21:55:00;1.5 minutes;White light far brighter than satellite drifts overhead and vanishes As I left a movie theater at 9:55 PM I saw a very bright, pure-white light above the southwest horizon.   It was far brighter than any satellite I've ever seen and appeared to be in the middle atmosphere from my perspective.  At first it appeared stationary, but after about 10 seconds I realized it was directly approaching my position. It traveled directly overhead to the opposite side of the sky in about a minute and a half, quickly dimming and completely disappearing about 15 degrees above the northeast horizon. The light was completely silent and maintained constant luminosity along its entire visible path.  There were no blinking lights evident, just continuous white light.  The sky in which I first observed the object was very close to a bank of halide lights from my perspective, which made me have a strong sense that the brightness of the object, its diffusion of light and its angle of incidence put it in the middle atmosphere at the highest.

Two lights appear within extremely close proximity, fly straight, and then vanish at the same time.;2011-09-04 21:37:00;1 minute;Two lights appear within extremely close proximity, fly straight, and then vanish at the same time. Two witnesses star-watching at Bald Hill recreation area saw two bright lights flying in formation across the night sky at precisely 9:37pm on September 4th, 2011.  The crafts were travelling in a linear fashion, heading from north to south before vanishing entirely.  The two craft were travelling in formation, at the exact same speed, and vanished from sight at precisely the same time.  At the point of vanishing, the lights simply disappeared from view.  There were no obstructions of sight during the event.  The craft were visible for approximately one minute before vanishing from sight.  The formation was one craft flying in front of the other, with both crafts flying very close to each other.  The craft were flying too close together to be civilian aircraft.  A possibility exists that the two craft were military aircraft.  There were no sounds heard from either craft before vanishing.  There were planes seen in the other parts of the night sky that remained in view! during the entirety of the event.;44.5724006666667;-123.272947333333
3 red-gold lights, moving slowly and silently from west to east between low clouds and the treetops.;2012-01-15 20:35:00;10 minutes;3 red-gold lights, moving slowly and silently from west to east between low clouds and the treetops. My husband was out on a walk in the snow between 8:30 and 9:00pm and saw three very bright red-gold lights moving slowly and silently from west to east across the sky, changing altitude from very low above the treetops up to the fairly low cloud level. He called me and we both watched them for about 5 minutes.   At first they were in a line but separated from each other, but they did not keep an even speed, sometimes moving closer to each other or even crossing paths.  Then about 8:45pm one of them disappeared, then one more, then about a minute later, the third one disappeared.;44.5724006666667;-123.272947333333
Bright orbs of lights rapidly moving above and through Jackson Frazer Wetlands;2015-04-23 00:00:00;~30 minutes;Bright orbs of lights rapidly moving above and through Jackson Frazer Wetlands I would like to report two possible sightings, both incidences were seen at the Jackson Frazier Wetlands in Corvallis, Oregon.   On April 21, 2015, a friend and I were sitting inside the wetlands, when we both noticed a large bright light  moving through the tops of the trees.  At first we thought it was a car on the hill behind it.  But as the light started shifting positions entirely too fast to have been a car driving on the hillside.  It also seemed to increase and decrease its intensity and size of the light.  It lasted for about five minutes the just disappeared. On April 24, 2015, I was sitting on top of my car watching for the meteor shower just outside the Wetlands, facing its entrance.  At about 12:00 am I noticed that one of the stars I was looking at just above the tree tops had started to rapidly moving up then down and side to side.  The way it moved can be compared to that of how humming birds fly.   I watched as it moved quickly shifted its position in the sky from left to right and up and down.  I watched as it darted behind a thick patch of clouds, then it shifted up and over to the front cloud.  This lasted for maybe ten or so minutes.   Now, there was a second light that appeared a little later but it was low to the ground and behind thick brush so I was not able to determine if this light I was seeing could be explained by something else, like people, therefore I will not bother with the details.;44.5724006666667;-123.272947333333
Bright light with spike like lights protruding from it.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probable sighting of Venus?  PD));2015-11-25 04:15:00;30 minutes;Bright light with spike like lights protruding from it. Observed a very bright set of lights hovering (but Def moving east to west).  The lights seemed to show a consistent bottom but intermittently (as it would move from East to west) would extend out and for a brief time it revealed what could only be described as a translucent top of saucer like object.   After observing for at least 20 min, 3 much smaller orb like lights appeared 2 fly towards the object (one at a time) and disappear into it.  Eventually the object faded out of sight.
