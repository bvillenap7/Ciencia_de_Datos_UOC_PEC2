2 amber lights dimming as ascending into sky.  Moving then stopping.;2013-12-31 23:10:00;1 minute;2 amber lights dimming as ascending into sky.  Moving then stopping. My husband and I just saw 2 UFOs while we were outside letting Katie go potty. They were really bright amber/orange solid lights (about 3X bigger than the brightest star in the sky).  We first saw one of them moving through the sky (sort of wavering) and then it stopped.  The light started to dim and we could see the object was round, then the light went out and I could sort of see it still before it vanished.  When the first craft stopped moving (before it vanished) we noticed a second one through the trees.  This one wasn't moving, it was staying still, it did not start moving until the first one vanished, instead it started moving east towards us, was coming closer (the light got brighter).  This one also dropped from its original position (it dropped a hundred feet?) and then it started on the same track that the first one did. It moved towards the center of our view, stopped, then the light started dimming (appearing to go farther into the sky).  The light went out and I could again see that it was a round object before it disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
