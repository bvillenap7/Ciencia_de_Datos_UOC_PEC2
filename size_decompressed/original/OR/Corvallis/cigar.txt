Saw cigar shaped whitish/blue object with pulsing white and blue lights in sky near home depot in Corvallis, Oregon;2021-05-18 00:00:00;20 seconds;Saw cigar shaped whitish/blue object with pulsing white and blue lights in sky near home depot in Corvallis, Oregon Over the small field next to home depot parking lot in Corvallis, Oregon for about 20-30 seconds my adult daughter and I witnessed a cigar shaped object that was very pale in color, a very light white or silver, with pulsing white and blue lights... It seemed to be flying very slowly, with a couple of brief stops where it just sort of hovered there blinking. It was pretty low, low enough that we could both tell that it was not an airplane or a helicopter. I turned in the car to tell my daughter to get my phone out of my purse so I could record it but when we looked back mere seconds later it was completely gone....nowhere to be seen.;44.5724006666667;-123.272947333333
