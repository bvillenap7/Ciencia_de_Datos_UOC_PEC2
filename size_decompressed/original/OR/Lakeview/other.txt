3 Orange lights over Warner Highway;2012-05-03 20:00:00;2 Minutes;3 Orange lights over Warner Highway Was traveling East on Warner Highway (Hwy 140) from Lakeview Oregon. Began ascent on a very windy road that was steep on passenger side. Initially noticed 3 round orange lights which were about quarter size of a full moon. Did not pay much attention at first as I was keeping my eyes on the road that wound up the mountainside.  I look over again and begin thinking how odd. 2 of the lights suddenly &quotblink&quot out.  It was not dark yet and I did not see anything that could have been the source. Few seconds later, one of the lights blinked back on and only two were now visible. After about another 45- 60 seconds both lights vanished.  These lights were just off the side of the mountain.  These lights did not seem to be falling as flares would. (I have seen military flares)  They did not seem to move at all however, I was trying to navigate the windy road. I do not believe them to be airplanes. I don't know if it could have been some kind of helicopter although! ,  I saw no trace of object when lights blinked out and then back on.;42.1854;-120.3775
