At first we thought they were radio towers.  But then more lights started appearing with them, and then they started move.  Each Object would fade out slowly and then quickly snap back into view, but when their lights would snap back on they were typically in a very different part of the sky.  After a while other similar objects seemed to show up and then later disappear. About two minutes after they were gone two military air-crafts flew into the area.  The military planes were very unique.  They only had one single orangish light on them that would breath in and out kinda like the light on a mac-book, but it wouldn't fade all the way out.  One of the plans seemed to go invisible right before it got over our heads and it stayed invisible until it was almost over the horizon.;42.1854;-120.3775
