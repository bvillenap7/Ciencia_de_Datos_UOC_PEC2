Two Huge Triangular objects seen in Central Southern Oregon;2005-07-19 21:00:00;1 hour;Two Huge Triangular objects seen in Central Southern Oregon As I was setting by a Campfire with my friend and her 2 children we heard a jet and looked up to its lights and another white light below it flying at the same speed in the area behind where the pilot probably could not see it.  Then we heard another jet sound and I walked down to the lake and looked for its lights, when I spotted a huge crafts 3 or 4 lights and yelled for the others to come and look.  It also had a small single light folling it.  About 20 minutes later a craft with the same jet noise and lights flew over us at the camp fire and turned left.  About 5 years ago I also saw a ufo in the desert, which came to a stop and then shot into space a tremendous speed and disappeared;42.1854;-120.3775
