Close to a mile wide saucer with windows seen in Southern Oregon in 1992 at dusk..;1992-08-15 20:30:00;5 minutes;close to a mile wide saucer with windows seen in Southern Oregon in 1992 at dusk.. I was sitting on the corral gate, feeding the 2 horses apples.  I was facing east as the sun was going down in the west behind me.  The ranch sits on 360 acres with the house next to the road.  The town is 15 miles due east and the international airport lies 7 miles from the edge of town and 8 miles from ranch.  Goose Lake is about 10 miles to the southeast.         I looked up and to the east, about 7 miles away, I estimate, was a large (judging by how far away it was I estimate that the saucer was almost a mile wide) saucer hovering.  No sound, no movement except the middle part was slowly rotating.  As it did, windows appeared (7 of them in all) all a bright orange and the rest of ship was a dark brown......  I slowly got down from gate of fence and backed away then ran the 100ft to side door of house to get my binoculars! 30 seconds I was out the door and the ship was gone...I waited 2 hours till dark looking, nothing...      The next day, after work, we went to town and stopped at the local bar.  I ran into someone and I was about to tell her what I saw last night when she said, I saw the strangest thing last night!  So I let her tell me.  She said., I was out side having a cig, when all of a sudden, this giant thing in the sky, real low, right above me moved past slowly.  It seemed to take forever...my cig burned down to the nubs lol   She continued to say there were lights all over it in red and white and orange with some texture on bottom of craft.  Then she was able to see the ship at a distance and described it just as I had here.  She agreed that it had to be close to a mile wide.
