My passenger shall have seen more than I. On 11-16-1999 approximately 3:15-3:20 AM while driving from Portland to Wilsonville on I-5 me and my passenger notice 3 big brigth white lights that we were approaching, we looked for blinking red or blue lights like normal aircraft have and we were unable to see any but the white. As we kept driving closer to it, the object was just motioneless and hoering over the tree tops to our left off the freeway. It was no more than a block or so off the side of the freeway. As we kept driving we got to see a side view and if I recall I think I saw a faint green light at the opposite end of the 3 white lights, I was driving so I was unable to keep a steady watch. Me and my passenger knew it was NOT a meteor as I saw one the night before and could not have been a plane as it did not have red or blue blinking lights and was not in that shape. Shape was approximatley a V shape to a triangle. this at my guess lasted for about 4 minutes. As we kept driving my passenger looks back and was able to still keep it in sight. When I was returning back about a 1/2hr later I looked for the object but it was no where to be seen.;45.4304266666667;-122.772846666667
