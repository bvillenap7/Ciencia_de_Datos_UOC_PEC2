In Tigard, Oregon, on 7/14/2012, around 10:00pm, my family and I witnessed a strange object in the sky.  My ten year old daughter saw it first through our large windows on the back of our house. She ran out onto our back deck and yelled for me to come outside. We saw a bright, glowing object, mostly orange with some red as well, and the lights were pulsating. The lights would get slightly larger, then smaller as it slowly moved (slower than plane) across a small portion of the sky.  It's tough to say what its exact shape was, because the object's glowing lights were so bright...but it seemed to be oblong, with the lights glowing more strongly towards the middle and back of the object.  It didn't make any sound. It was heading in a southwest direction, but after a minute or so, it started gaining elevation at a quick rate, getting smaller, into a pinpoint light into the sky, and then disappeared.  At first, it was lower in the sky than most planes, but by the time it left, it looked as far away as a star.  I was amazed how fast it moved. I called for my husband to see it and he also said that he hadn't ever seen anything like it and it certainly wasn't a plane. I then asked my daughter how she first noticed it and she said it was first at the tree line level (near the top of some tall pine trees) and very large.  I asked her how large and she said it was huge.  It it looked like, in her words a huge, glowing lantern that was floating up over the trees.;45.4304266666667;-122.772846666667
