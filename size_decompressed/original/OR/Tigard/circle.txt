Two very distinct bright lights traveling east at 9:22pm PST.  ((NUFORC Note:  ISS and Space Shuttle in formation.  PD));2009-09-08 21:22:00;20 seconds;I witnessed last night, two very distinct bright lights traveling east at 9:22pm PST.  I live in Oregon. The lights were equdistant apart and moved at the same speed and were extremely bright  Then the first one disappeared, while the trailing one kept on and then also disappeared at the same point in the sky as the first. They looked like satelites but they were so bright!  Then the disappearing thing threw me off. Do you have any idea as to what these were? ((NUFORC Note:  ISS and Space Shuttle in formation.

Round circular flashy object seen in the sky for the past 3 days.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus??  PD));2017-01-06 18:24:00;1 hour;Round circular flashy object seen in the sky for the past 3 days. We have been seeing this weird object in the sky, for the past 3 days, from 6 pm to around 7 pm.  It is a wild flash and when looked through a telescope it is shaped like a round circle.  It is also spinning as we look through the telescope. ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus??

Circular disc red lights around perimeter, flashed white then red again.;2019-01-01 22:44:00;7 secondss;Circular disc red lights around perimeter, flashed white then red again. On 1/1/19 at 22:44, I went to let my dog out before retiring to bed.  For some reason I stepped out the door and above me in the sky was a round object with red lights around the perimeter.  The lights turned to white, flashed and then turned red again.  There were other lights going toward the center of the circle.  These lights were red.  Too large to be a drone. I didn’t want to get my phone for fear it would be gone when I came out again.  It continued to fly to the left of my house and then I couldn’t see it. Ran to the front of my house as I did, I grabbed my phone.  Clicked on the video but couldn’t find it.  Then upon looking north I spotted it for a second as it passed behind two pine trees in the distance.  Not enough time to get it on video. That’s about it just wondering if anyone else had spotted this.;45.4304266666667;-122.772846666667
