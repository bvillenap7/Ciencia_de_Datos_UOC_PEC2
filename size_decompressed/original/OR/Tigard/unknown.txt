Visiting my daughter in Tigard, Oregon to attend wedding and babysit while she went on honeymoon.  The evening of August 16, 1992 I went out on the patio to smoke a cigarette.  I was looking at the stars and watching planes fly overhead.  Then the sky suddenly became black--no stars, no planes.  Then the lights appeared--8 to 10 'v' shaped lights that appeared ahead of the blackness.  The lights and blackness slowly glided overhead in a westerly direction towards Portland, Oregon.  This thing was gigantic and I did not detect any sound as it passed overhead.  It was not moving fast like the airplanes I had seen just a few moments before, it was moving very slow.  I got up and started to walk across the backyard in the direction the lights were travelling, then the lights disappeared as if they had tilted upward, a few seconds later the stars and planes reappeared as if nothing had been there.  No light trails, nothing.  I was 51 at the time, not drinking, do not use drugs, not known to halucinate, divorced, owned my own business, two children at home.  I called my aunt who lives in the area the next day and told her what I had seen, also my granddaughter, and daughter's tenant.;45.4304266666667;-122.772846666667

The intial color was white and turned very quickly to green. We observed this while sitting in our hot tub and lost sight of it as it went behind a neighbors house.

7 - 8 Bright Lights Seen in Night Sky over Tigard, Oregon 12/22/12;2012-12-22 18:00:00;8-10 minutes;7 - 8 Bright Lights Seen in Night Sky over Tigard, Oregon 12/22/12 My husband and I were driving home @ about 5:30 – 6:00 pm on December 22, 2012 when we both saw 7 to 8 bright lights in the sky in front of us.  It was raining and dark and I thought I was seeing reflections on the windshield from Christmas lights nearby.  My husband thought he was seeing a new light tower and was thinking “that wasn’t there before”.  But we both realized that we were seeing something strange and we pulled the car over and got out. We didn’t know what we were seeing because we had never seen anything like it.  The lights seemed to be moving slowly, but we couldn’t tell how big or fast they were going but they were definitely there.  In fact I called my Mom who lives nearby and she saw them too.  The position of the lights was:   there were 2 lights way out in front and then some distance farther back were the other 6 lights.  They did not seem to be any special formation or pattern.  Some lights were very close to each other, and others were farther away, but different distances from each other.  As they moved across the sky they did not change their positions in relation to each other they stayed in the same positions. At first we thought they were helicopters, but there wasn’t any noise of any kind it was silent.  Then we thought airplanes, but some of them were much too close to each other to be airplanes, and the lights were not the same as on an airplane.  The lights were solid yellow/orange.  They did not blink at all. We both know what an airplane lights looks like at night and approximately where they are.  An airplane has blinking lights these lights were much much bigger and remained solid.  They did not blink. What we saw wasn’t anything we have ever seen before.  I told my husband that we had just seen our first UFO.  We watched the lights for approximately 8-10 minutes more until they disappeared into the clouds.;45.4304266666667;-122.772846666667
