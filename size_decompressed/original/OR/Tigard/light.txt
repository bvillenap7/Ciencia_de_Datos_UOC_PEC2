Remained in that position till 0130am 10/22/99. at that time i went inside. Went back out at 0430am 11/22/99 object was still there but had moved with relations to stars to the west and was not quite as bright. 10/21/99 1135pm I went outside and was facine east.  I looked up and saw a bright object traveling from the north in a southern direction approx 10 deg. easr of straight up. I watched it for approx 15 seconds. I could not see any flashing lights and my first thought was it is a satalite.  It seemed quite high and I got the impression that it was reflecting sunlight because it had the same shine as the moon which was approx 20 deg  west of the object. At that point the object stopped and stayed in that position.  I went inside and got my 7x50 glasses and my wife to come out and see it. She said she could see a small flashing on the left side but I could not see any other lights At that piont it was approx 20 deg to my s/sw.  I thought at the time it must be very large to be so bright because I got the sense it was very high also. I kept checking on it till 0130am 10/22/99 and went in.  It did not change its position other than to move in relation to the stars and the moon during that time.  At 0430am10/22/99 I went out to look at it again and it had moved to approx 35 to 40 deg above the horizin in the west.  The morning star, Venus was comming up in the east at that time and the brightnes of venus was very close to the brightnes of the object the previous night. The object and the morning star were approx 150 deg apart at that time (0430am). I have seen many satalites and this was at least 2 to 3 times brighter and larger.  The object and the planet Venus were approx on the some latitude.;45.4304266666667;-122.772846666667

Observed for approximately 1.5 minutes before the lights disappeared one by one.  Was driving west on Fischer Road in Tigard, Oregon and pulled over and stopped to confirm that the objects were moving (they were).;45.4304266666667;-122.772846666667
All the jets I see at cruising altitudes take at least 12 seconds to cover the same area, and dont look like actual stars.;2013-07-03 03:30:00;4 seconds;All the jets I see at cruising altitudes take at least 12 seconds to cover the same area, and dont look like actual stars. 3:30 AM on July 3rd facing East towards Mt. Hood from Tigard, Oregon, I witnessed an unusual blinking light approximately 60 degrees above the Eastern horizon.  This star-like light was traveling from South to North at a high rate of speed, and its altitude was approximately 30,000 FT.  I live under a major vector route for aircraft traveling from the South heading North towards Seattle, and I see planes fly in the sky all the time.  This light flashed bright very much like an iridium flare, disappeared, then had a secondary flash that was a very faint light blue color, followed up by the bright flash again.  The speed was also very fast, it went from South of Portland to well North of Portland in 4 seconds.   This light was star-like in nature, and almost seemed to mimic the pattern of anti-collision strobes of a typical aircraft.  It was very different from all the aircraft I witness on a regular basis, and was completely silent.;45.4304266666667;-122.772846666667
This is the second report I've submitted this month since my 1st on 07/03/13 with similar lights.;2013-07-24 03:53:00;27 minutes;This is the second report I've submitted this month since my 1st on 07/03/13 with similar lights. At 3:53 AM on July 24th, 2013, my girlfriend was outside on the porch and called me out because she saw 2 red orbs side by side to the East about 30 degrees above the horizon.  I came outside and they were gone, and apon looking at the sky for 20 minutes we saw what first appeared as a satellite traveling from South to North at almost 90 degrees, but it was going invisible every other second and appeared to zig zag off of its path.   Another couple minutes later we saw another satellite type light travel from North to South, and it too was zig zagging and also appeared to slow down and speed up.   After my girlfriend's initial sighting at 3:53 AM, we saw a total of 4 of these strange flybys until around 4:30 AM.   We investigated further on NASA's skywatch website and no satellite flybys were scheduled during this period of time.   Astronomy and aviation has been a hobby of mine for over 10 years, and I've been watching the skies for over a decade, and not one satellite, ISS pass, iridium flare, or aircraft has ever flown so strangely.   Thank you.;45.4304266666667;-122.772846666667
Two very bright, star-like objects side by side at an angle.;2016-09-24 20:45:00;10 seconds;Two very bright, star-like objects side by side at an angle. Two bright lights, side by side at an angle (approx. 45 degree), near Andromeda constellation.  Thought they were stars, but I know there are no such stars in that area that bright.  Just as I realized that fact, they began to faded.  The one on the right faded quicker than the one on the left.;45.4304266666667;-122.772846666667

Row of lights moving together silently through the sky;2021-05-04 21:30:00;A few minutes;Row of lights moving together silently through the sky On Tuesday, May 4, 2021, at approximately 9:30pm, my partner and I were outside enjoying a fire in our fire pit when I noticed very strange lights out of the corner of my eye. We both then looked up and saw a row of lights floating through the sky. There were many small lights moving together, all a part of one object silently moving through the sky. The lights were not in an even pattern and were steady as it moved through the sky. My partner and I ran to the front of the house to continue watching it as it moved. It passed over the nearby hill and disappeared into the darkness, as if designed to easily blend in at night.  My camera on my phone was not strong enough to pick up the lights, but my partner’s phone was. The image does not show the details of all of the little lights as it looks like a more solid ray of light, but the image does show that there may have been more there than what was visible to the eye. In the photo, you can see a difference in the coloring above the lights, as if coming up to a point. This leads me to believe that the lights were along the edge of the object, flat underneath, and domed to a point on the top.;45.4304266666667;-122.772846666667
Fast moving bright light seen near Portland, OR.  ((NUFORC Note:  Report from airline captain.  PD));2021-08-25 21:05:00;2 minutes;Fast moving bright light seen near Portland, OR Background of ((name deleted)): Over 5000 flight hours.  Currently a captain with ((company name deleted)).  Bachelor’s Degree in Aeronautical Science from Embry Riddle. Narrative from ((witness name deleted)): Sitting in my hot tub and observed a bright white object go from southwest to northeast. It was traveling at a high speed estimated to be about 5 times faster than a normal jet at cruise and/or 6 times faster than the international space station seen from Earth. The object was at about 10,000 feet and there was cloud coverage with a thin broken ceiling in the background. The object did not appear to show any navigational lights or strobes, apparent on most aircraft. It was also a bright white steady light compared to the more yellowish tint of aircraft. My fiancée also saw the object and noticed it a few seconds before me. She said it was traveling due east and then changed directions to go northeast. She is a flight attendant and originally thought it was a commercial aircraft. About 5 minutes after the object disappeared a commercial aircraft flew overhead and my fiancee was able to notice the difference between what we saw and the commercial aircraft.
