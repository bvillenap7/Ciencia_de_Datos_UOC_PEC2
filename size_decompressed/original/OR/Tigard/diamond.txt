Large, black, diamond-kite shaped object;1997-03-23 19:37:00;1 second;Summary : Large, black, diamond-kite shaped object I was looking up to view the comet from my driveway when I saw an object approaching from the Northern horizon.  Its speed was at least 500 Knots and it seemed to be accelerating as it passed directly overhead. It was  at about 2500 feet AGL and climbing. Its heading was 170 degrees.  It appeared to be at least 400 feet wide and 700 feet long. Its size and speed were difficult to judge because it was totally silent and it traveled from the Northern to Southern horizon so quickly. It had a faint purple glow along its leading and trailing edges, and had a series of luminous red-pink box like sections along the belly at the front. I've been trying to convince myself for the past five months that it was some top secret aerospace plane prototype.  I have never seen anything like it, and I am fairly familiar with aircraft.  I have no interest in defending the credibility of my experience, I saw it and it was weird, period.;45.4304266666667;-122.772846666667
