A cylindar shaped object, traveling over the pacific ocean, sighting from oregon.;1999-08-10 02:00:00;45 minutes;A cylindar shaped object, traveling over the pacific ocean, sighting from oregon. We were driving along the coast of oregon, when the whole sky flashed green. Shortly after the flash, an object of a greenish bluish hue started to move across the sky. It moved at a slow pace, and we did not see where it had started, we believe it just appeared in the night sky. As it was moving, the cylindar shaped object seemed to give off flashes and bolts of some kind. After the flashes from the object it seemed to swoop down, and continue to do this for quite some time. Then the flashing green bolts started again and continued for 10 or 15 minutes. The bolts looked as if there was elictricity or lightning coming off the object. The objects flashing bolts came to an abrubt stop, and the object seemed to split into two. The now two objects started to move at a tremendous speed towards the horizon of the dark ocean. The light the objects were giving off started to fade away, and disappeared into the dark fogged sky. I was traveling with my dad, a lawyer in Los Angeles. My friend peter who works for microsoft. I am 33 years old, and i work in los angeles as a marine biolgist. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));45.4524999999999;-123.8198
Brightly lit cylindrical object rises slowly above Tillamook Bay, Oregon;2004-02-02 19:30:00;10 Minutes;Brightly lit cylindrical object rises slowly above Tillamook Bay, Oregon Driving north on Highway 101 to my home in Bay City, OR I observed a bright cylinder shaped light approximately 500 feet above the south end of Tillamook Bay.  At my home in Bay City, OR I observed the bright light through binoculars.  The object appeared to be a fully illuminated cylinder that was rising slowly in a northwesterly direction.  The cylinder entered a broken cloud cover and illuminated the clouds around the cylinder.  The cylinder continued to rise and disappeared from view after approximately 5 minutes.  Approximately 5 minutes after the cylinder disappeared, jet fighter aircraft were heard above the Bay City, OR area.;45.4524999999999;-123.8198
Bright glowing orb;2011-09-21 20:30:00;10 seconds;Bright glowing orb I am interested in finding out if anyone else saw what I saw.   On September 21st around 8:30 pm I was driving on the Wilson River Loop in Tillamook Oregon and saw a green orb fly over my car.  It was coming from the east heading west.  It was bright glowing green.  About 75 to 100 feet above the ground.   It was flying at a steady but slow pace.  It arched across the sky and started zig zagging.  Then looked like it fell or landed in a cow pasture.  Please contact me if you know if anyone saw it or if you think it could have been an electricity ball.   Thank you.;45.4524999999999;-123.8198
