My family and I observed a large bright as it moved north out over the Pacific ocean off of the northernm Oregon coast.;2002-07-15 22:00:00;approx. 1.5 hrs;My family and I observed a large bright as it moved north out over the Pacific ocean off of the northernm Oregon coast. Me, my wife and our two children (ages 11 and 16) were sitting at our campfire at Cape Lookout. I was facing west, looking out at the ocean, when I saw a large, bright light out over the water. I pointed it out to my family and asked, What is that? My wife thought it was a star, until I pointed out that it was much too large to be a star (or a planet). We all watched it over the next 90 minutes as it moved slowly to the north and closer to the horizon. We could tell it was moving because it changed position in the sky relative to a stand of trees.  There were no blinking lights, just a steady, large, bright yellow/white light.;45.4524999999999;-123.8198
Lights moving around in the night sky, Sky formations.;2014-09-13 22:00:00;2 hours;Lights moving around in the night sky, Sky formations Saturday, Sept 13, 2014 – Cape Lookout Park, Tillamook Oregon – Pacific Ocean 10PM, PST  A group of friends and I went camping for the weekend.  That night, five of us walked out to the beach to catch the moonrise over the hills.  While sitting on the beach, I noticed a bright red light in the sky.  The light was changing to blue, green, white… I thought for sure it was a plane.  But then I noticed it wasn’t moving, it was just hovering.  The light began to zig-zag, drop and rise and shoot left to right and back to the left again. It would move in lines that were diagonal to the ocean.  After watching this UFO for about 20 minutes, a few more friends showed up and another UFO lit up in the sky, but located on the oceans horizon.  This one glowed bright orange.  A third UFO appeared to the right of the second UFO.  All three UFO’s were moving around in various shapes and speeds and flickering their lights at one another, as if they were signaling each other.   The first and third UFO flew out of there with no trace, leaving the second UFO in the sky.  This one was by far the most active of the three.  It had to have been at least 25 miles from us, but at times it moved closer to us, the light was bigger and brighter.  It split at one point and then rejoined. The moon came up over the hills a little after 11:20pm.  As the moon was rising, the UFO was almost playing “peek a boo” with it.  The UFO would dip under the horizon and then shoot right back up, zig-zag on the sky and plummet again or shoot off to the left or right. It was such an amazing night to watch the UFO’s.  All of my friends and I were in complete awe that we got to witness this rare sighting.;45.4524999999999;-123.8198
Bright light in sky moving around then dimming periodically viewed from Twins Ranch camping in Tillamook, OR, USA.;2020-08-13 22:00:00;60;Bright light in sky moving around then dimming periodically viewed from Twins Ranch camping in Tillamook, OR, USA. Yellowish/white, similar to color of a bright star, planet or satelite.  However, it moved erratically but side to side or up and down almost like on a Joy ride.  This lasted for at least 60 minutes.  After which then the light started to dim then get bright then dim and get bright periodically until we finally just went to bed.  My two 13 year olds confirmed they saw what I was seeing, that I wasn't crazy.  This is my first siting of SOMETHING, but what it was is unknown.;45.4524999999999;-123.8198
