Large white lights at each end, moving very slowly, at low altitude, and no sound. I drive a wood chip truck and travel to various mills and wood processing facilities in the Willamette Valley and southern Washington.   Friday, 6-19-2015, at approx. 19:45, I witnessed two military Blackhawk helicopters flying near Halsey, OR, at around 100 feet elevation, and thought it was a little odd, but dismissed it.   I then proceeded to Camas, Washington, and at approx. 22:45, while traveling eastbound on Hwy 14 in Washington, saw 4 or 5 Blackhawk helicopters hovering over the Columbia River, spaced around a half mile apart or so.   I unloaded at the mill then headed west on 14, and turned south on to the 205 freeway and then south on I-5, and continued south heading back to Eugene, OR.  As I came to the north side of Salem, OR, there was another chopper hovering maybe a hundred feet above the freeway, then another one at about the same elevation on the south side of Salem.    I continued south and took exit 244 just north of Albany, OR, and pulled over to the shoulder of the on ramp to have a smoke.  I was outside of the truck and noticed a craft coming from the northwest and it flew directly over me and continued on in a southeast direction.   The craft was flying at maybe 1,500 hundred feet, and incredibly slow, and was completely silent.  The craft was shaped basically like a giant ruler, and had large square shaped lights on each side.  For comparison if you look at a ruler and go from the end of the ruler to 2 inches on one side and from the end of the ruler to 10 inches that would be comparable to the size of the lights, and  From how far the lights were separated it had to be the size of two 747’s sitting wing tip to wing tip..   The lights were white in color and didn’t flash or change at all and as it flew past me there was another small white light flashing from one side of the craft to the other.  There were no nose or tail lights and really appeared to be a giant skinny rectangle.   I got back in the truck and continued south on I-5, and lost sight of the object over the hills to the southwest, and as I approached Albany, OR, there was another chopper hovering just off to the west of the freeway.;44.63993125;-123.0923625
Large reddish orange craft moving SW at fast rate of speed. Heard roaring almost like engine. Noisy neighborhood though.;2016-08-13 00:47:00;20 seconds;Large reddish orange craft moving SW at fast rate of speed.  Heard roaring almost like engine.  Noisy neighborhood though. I stepped outside to look for meteors, and looked about 45 degrees SW towards the moon and saw a bright red, almost life fire from a night air balloon, moving across the sky very fast.  The lights we're not flashing or changing colors, but were like a glowing red and orange.  The glowing area was close enough near the moon that it appeared to be half the size of the moon.  It was probably no more than 5 miles away.  I could hear a humming or rotary sound like an airship of some kind.  But it moved across the sky towards to the SW and was gone from wight within 20 to 30 seconds.   I missed about 10 when seconds, when I ran inside like an idiot to tell my son.;44.63993125;-123.0923625
Two strange bright white lights hovering high above interstate;2017-02-25 21:30:00;5 minutes;Two strange bright white lights hovering high above interstate Wife noticed bright light above I-5 near Albany.  Light appeared to be brighter and more white than the softer yellow glow of a streetlight.  Light was also much higher in the air than any possible structure could reach and basically hovered directly over highway.  Harshness of light dissipated as we drove under it, revealing a lit rectangular shaped bottom.  Similar hovering light appeared again a few minutes later further down the highway.   I've driven this same stretch of I-5 many times before, and have never seen, or noticed, anything like this.;44.63993125;-123.0923625
Bright white object with flashing red lights appeared to be triangle shaped.;2017-08-30 22:00:00;10 minutes;Bright white object with flashing red lights appeared to be triangle shaped. I was in my backyard and noticed a very bright light in the west sky.  The white light had red lights on it that appeared to be blinking.  I honestly thought it was a plane at first, however it seemed to hover in one spot and then move back and forth.  At one point it seemed to move toward my direction and it looked like a triangle.   I had my daughter come look and she thought it was a plane but it continued to hover and move back and forth which was exactly what I saw.  There wasn't any noise, it was a clear night many stars but nothing like this.   I'm going to email the video and pictures.;44.63993125;-123.0923625
