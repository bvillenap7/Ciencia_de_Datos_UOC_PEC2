This occurred on a beautiful day in daylight hours with clear skys. All children concurred that they heard a loud roar and what also sounded as a sonic boom.  Approximately a minute latter they witnessed seven military jets possibly from the Portland Oregon Air Base, traveling in the direction from the north to south. The jets suddenly made an abrupt turn to the west in the direction of travel they last saw the craft traveling.  The children all concure that the craft was very large and as described by my son as at least as large as two houses.  They also said the craft had four green lights on the underside or belly of the craft. I tried to determine altitude by asking the children if it was traveling at a height were commercial jets fly. Their answer was about half the distance of were you would expect a commercial jet liner to fly.  I would estimate approximately 20,000 ft.

It was very bright. I turned to my left and there was also one more object same shape and description above the house but much higher in the sky. It continued to move up until I could no longer see it. It is a mostly clear evening with a few lingering thin clouds.

Two bright orbs dropped from the sky and glided  incredibly fast across the entire sky, going south over Oregon.;2011-11-09 04:30:00;30 seconds;Two bright orbs dropped from the sky and glided  incredibly fast across the entire sky, going south over Oregon. My daughter and I fell asleep watching a movie.  I woke up briefly and looked for the remote to turn off the DVD player.  I tightened the blanket around my daughter and laid back down on the couch in the living room where I stayed to sleep next to her. I laid there trying to fall back asleep and I noticed a VERY bright light drop strait down from far up in the sky.  There was no sound but as I sat up to look my daughter woke up and turned to see what I was looking at.  The orb or disk of bright light then soared almost glided across the entire sky VERY fast, amazingly fast.  My daughter turned to look at me and I at her and another light shown through the window.  This bright light dropped from the sky in the same place but not as high as the first one, stopped and as fast as the other one, glided across the entire sky in the same direction.  There was never any sound.  I told my daughter I'd look into it in the morning and laid there awake till morning.;44.63993125;-123.0923625

5 bright flashing lights, blue, red, green and white.;2013-11-23 23:30:00;>1 hour;5 bright flashing lights, blue, red, green and white There was a flashing light in the sky.  It was blue, red, green and white.  I thought it was an airplane, but it did not move.   We watched it for almost one hour then just got tired of it.  There were 4 in front of my house and one in the back.  There was one that was very bright.  It almost looked like lights on a cop car.   The others seemed farther away and were not as bright.  The brightest one was very big and in an obvious circle shape.  We are getting used to seeing the orange lights, tonight was different.  These were very strange.   I wonder why Albany has so many sightings but no one ever investigates them.;44.63993125;-123.0923625
New Years Eve 2013 sighting of four orange lights in Albany Oregon.;2013-12-31 20:30:00;15 minutes;New Years Eve 2013 sighting of four orange lights in Albany Oregon Sighting occurred on Dec 31st 2013 between 8:30 and 8:45.  I spotted four unidentifiable orange lights in the skies above 1525 SE Geary St, located in Albany Oregon. 	A small orange light, about equal in size to the lights you might see on a passing airplane and at about the same elevation, was seen suspended in place in the west sky, alone and unmoving.  Two of my co-workers spotted the light and we observed it for approximately a minute before a second orange light appeared to rise slowly from directly below the first light, and then moved into place just to the left (south) of the first light.  Once in position directly left of the first light, the second light stayed motionless in the air, the same as the first.  We observed these two lights for about five minutes, until the second light traveled increasing its elevation while moving away west, until it was no longer visible.  The first light remained in it's position. 	Almost immediately after the exit of the second light, a third light, of equal size and hue as the first two was spotted in the northeast sky, at about the same elevation and distance from our location as the first two.  This light also remained motionless in the sky.  We observed this third light as well as the first for another minute or so before a fourth light appears in the sky to the right (east) of the third light and just slightly above it.  This light again was the same hue, size, and height as the first three lights.   The light remained in position next to the third for about two to five minutes before traveling up in elevation and away from us towards the northeast, in the same manner as the second light.  About five minutes after that, the third light disappeared, heading up and away just as the third light had done.  The first light remained in it's position for another few minutes before also traveling up and away in the westward direction, just like the secon! d light. 	All of the lights were the same hue, size,  and distance from our position.  The light was orange, like the color of flame, and solid, not blinking.  The lights all moved very slowly and in directions a commercial airplane could not, such as straight up. ((NUFORC Note:  We are personally acquainted with this witness, and we consider him to be highly reliable.  We suspect that he is an excellent witness.  PD));44.63993125;-123.0923625
Two bright white lights moving very fast eventually stopping next to a third into a triangle formation;2015-09-24 21:00:00;10 minutes;Two bright white lights moving very fast eventually stopping next to a third into a triangle formation I was in the backyard, talking on the phone, and a bright white, round, object caught my eye in the sky.   I began watching it and it started darting back and forth extremely fast it was at times difficult to follow.   I then noticed another bright white light that appear to drop out of the original white light and it started darting around.  Both white lights then stopped next to a third light I hadnâ€™t noticed, and they went into a triangle formation.  There a very dim line that appeared to connect each light to one another.   Once the lights aligned into the triangle they were gone.   It was a very clear night with some low clouds.   The entire sighting lasted approximately 10 minutes.;44.63993125;-123.0923625

Round bright object.;2017-08-14 21:20:00;15 minutes;Round bright object I noticed a very bright white object to the west while I took my dogs out tonight.  The object was larger and brighter than the stars.  I watched the object for 15 minutes it didn't move like a plane and there wasn't any noise.  When it moved it at times left a streak of light behind it.   It went from the West to the East towards I-5, which I live close to.  This object didn't move in a pattern like a plane and when it moved it took a few seconds to track where it moved to.  It was a round bright white object.   The last time I saw it it moved toward the North East and was gone.   The night was very clear lots of stars.  I'm not sure what this was, but I am sure it was not a plane or a star.;44.63993125;-123.0923625
