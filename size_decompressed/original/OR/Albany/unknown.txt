Unknown Lights;2013-07-03 00:00:00;5 minutes;Unknown Lights I went to the backyard to let my dog go potty (12:15 am).   All of sudden I looked up in the sky and saw a white light about the size of a pencil eraser.  I figured it was a plane, but all of sudden it changed size from pencil eraser to like a dime, and changed colors to red on top, and blue on bottom.   There was no sound to be heard.   Something like a red/white light or flair shone out of the bottom toward the ground.  Almost instantly, it did a weird s-type turn to the upper right and the lights went out.   I kept looking at the sky, and in about 15 to 30 seconds it reappeared to the right of where I originally saw it, about dime size, red on top, blue on bottom.  I decided to get some friends in the house to come out to see it, but by the time we all looked back at the sky, it was gone.  We watched watched the area in the sky for about 15/20 minutes but never saw anything.   For the next hour, off and on, I looked at the sky, but it never re-appeared.   I do not know what it was, but it was not like anything I've seen.  Its movements were very fast and strange.;44.63993125;-123.0923625
