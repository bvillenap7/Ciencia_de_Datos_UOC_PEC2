Noticed a red light in front and above us heading North. Suddenly, it changed direction and headed south without turning or stopping first. As I was getting out of the truck my husband was steadily watching and observed the red light make a 90 degree turn without stopping and head West. We continued to watch it outside of the vehicle for about a minute when it suddenly stopped and seemed to get smaller or gain altitude. Within a few seconds it stopped gaining altitude and was motionless. A few seconds later 5 or 6 smaller lights appeared to fall from the bottom and saw 1 of them veer off to the East. Within a few seconds the red light disappeared and no other unusual activity was noticed within the next few minutes before we resumed driving home.

White Light Moving Fast;2012-08-11 10:00:00;5 or 10 seconds;White Light Moving Fast I was sitting on my back porch. Suddenly I saw a white light moving in the sky. It was moving fast. It moved too fast and was too far away for me to make out the shape of the craft. I wanted to continue to follow it with my eyes but it flew behind a tree. I couldn't see it anymore because the leaves and branches were in the way. I ran to the other side of the tree to follow it. But by the time I got there the craft had disappeared. Once again this was just a white light moving horizontal very fast.;44.63993125;-123.0923625
Unknown object (light) seen over Albany, Oregon on July 5th, shortly after 10 pm.;2014-07-05 22:03:00;10 seconds;Unknown object (light) seen over Albany, Oregon on July 5th, shortly after 10 pm. On July 5th, my husband, granddaughter and I walked out our front door to light off some leftover fireworks.  It was several minutes after 10 pm.  My husband was bent over in the street in front of our house, attempting to light the first firework.  My granddaughter and I were gazing up at the sky.  It was a clear night and we were looking at the stars.  Suddenly, we saw a light, about the brightness of a planet, moving overhead.  The object was coming from a southwesterly direction.  At first, we thought it was a plane, but quickly realized that there were no blinking lights and it was moving at an incredible rate of speed much faster than any plane I have ever seen.  Also, we could not detect any sound coming from the object.   We quickly called attention to it and my husband stopped what he was doing to watch it with us.  The object was traveling in a northeasterly direction, traversing an arc of about 120 degrees.  We were stunned at the speed with which it traveled, having never seen anything that has ever come close to that speed not military or civilian jet or satellite.   Within about 10 seconds, it disappeared from our view.   My husband and I  are used to watching the sky and have always,up to this point, been able to identify what we have seen.  We had no clue what this object was, however. ((NUFORC Note:  All three witnesses to this sighting are well known to NUFORC, and we consider them to be exceptionally capable, and reliable, witnesses.   Please see similar sighting from Harrington, WA, for approximately the same time.  PD));44.63993125;-123.0923625
Two fast moving white lights in the sky.;2015-10-13 21:05:00;5 minutes;Driving home from the store my daughter and I both noticed two fast moving white lights in the sky.  The lights darted across the sky going South.  We followed the lights approximately 2 miles and were unable to keep up with them.  We lost sight of the lights as they went over a tall grove of trees.  There were headed toward the I-5 corridor going toward Eugene.  They were round and white in color and didnâ€™t make any noise.  This is the second time in a month that I have noticed lights like this in this general area.  It was a clear evening no clouds.;44.63993125;-123.0923625
