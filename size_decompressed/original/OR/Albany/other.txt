My sister and I were walking over to the neighbor's to feed their pets while they were on vacation.  We lived in the country at the time so there were few houses around us.  As we walked along the gravel road to their house, we looked into the sky at about a 60 degree angle.  It was very cloudy so that the sky couldn't be seen.  However, in the clouds, there were a bunch of color bursts.  It went on for a minute or two, in a very limited area of the clouds.  There were green, blue, orange, yellow, and pink bursts.  They didn't follow any pattern as to location in the area of cloud or the series of colors.  We didn't think it was any sort of lightning as the weather didn't feel like thunder and lightning weather at all. We watched it until it stopped and then fed the neighbor's pets.

11 orange colored singular lights/crafts seen by 3;2015-03-02 23:15:00;10 minutes;11 orange colored singular lights/crafts seen by 3 My husband and I walked outside of our house at 11:15pm the night of March 2nd, 2015, to witness multiple singular Orange colored lights in the sky.   At first, it looked as if there were only 6 of light/crafts, but as we stepped out further into our front yard we saw 5 more flying directly over us and our house, 11 craft in total.   6 lights were traveling in a straight line one after another with almost perfect distance between them on the Western horizon headed South with the other 5 lights in the Southeastern part of the sky, these lights were the ones that flew directly over our house and my husband and I, these lights/crafts seemed MUCH closer than the other 6 on the horizon, this group of lights was also traveling South.   The two formations of lights seemed to be traveling to the same point in the sky...  The Southeastern group of lights stopped in the sky and 3 of them formed a perfect triangle while the other 2 made a line below the triangle, in the end, with the formation looking like a key shape or a backwards P.  This group of lights stayed in the sky for at least 3 minutes before one by one they disappeared.   The other 6 lights were traveling in a perfect line for about 1-1.5 minutes.  Then the lights started grouping together in pairs and traveling at the same speed next to each other then stopped and made a square, then a triangle and then a long triangle and stayed in that same formation and spot in the sky for several minutes then one by one they disappeared also.   I was able to snap 2 photos of the crafts flying over our house but for some reason after that my camera would not work for me to take a video.   These are the same lights we saw in the sky no more than a month ago.  Same color, same shape, almost the same time of night, but this time there were A LOT MORE!!!  The first time there were only 4 crafts and we were able to get a video which is on my desktop.   I reported that incident here as well.  Not sure what is going on, but this seems to be becoming a frequent happening.  Good, bad?  Not exactly sure but it does give one quite an ERIE feeling.   Anyone else in the area see these lights?  How do I attach the video and photos to this report?   Can someone please tell me what is going on?????;44.63993125;-123.0923625

They said it was like a ball of molten liquid, made a crackling sound.  They thoughy maybe a plane was crashing... they even called 911.   As they are telling me rhis, I chalked it up to be, Yeah, right, they had top much to drink. Until i stayed over and slept in a tent in their back yard August 2016.  I woke up at about 6am, to a low flying molten ball dripping like molten metal is the only way to describe it, crackling, flew at a decline to where it got so low it almost hit the roof.  I freaked out, frozen in place.  Later that morning, we looked for burns in the yard or on the concrete but didn't find a single thing of evidence.  I dont know what i saw but i know my parents aren't lying cause I saw it myself, dead sober, just after dawn when I was alone.  My dad and mom have had sightings of the same thing since even as recent as a couple of weeks ago.  There is no pattern.  No reports of space rocks.. nothing.  I know what i saw and i dont know what the hell to even call it.  And its always the same.  A ball of orange dripping like molten metal with a crackling sound swmi slow moving and declines in altitude, and then suddenly it's gone.;44.63993125;-123.0923625
