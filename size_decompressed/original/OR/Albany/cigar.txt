Traveling at high rate of speed at same altitude as plane (Aprox. 20-30,000 feet)  Stopped movement and appeared to observe us as we observed it.  Stayed stationary for approx. 10 min. until another plane flew close, craft dropped altitude suddenly and took off at high rate of speed.  We could hear the plane not the craft. My Dad and I were loading a U-Haul truck and a washer and dryer my best friend had bought from my parents.  We were sky gazing when I noticed an object following a plane at a high rate of speed.  My binoculars happened to be in the car and I got them hoping to get a better look.  When the object came close to the plane it quickly came to a stop and hovered. When I aimed the binoculars to it, it seemed like it noticed.  I felt like someone or something was watching me.  My dad felt it too.  So did my best friend who is a non-believer.  She was in shock.  The object was a cross between a cigar and a cylinder.  It had a red tip and the rest of it was a periwinkle blue color.  It was omiting a vapor like exhaust and had port hole windows that had a warm whte glow illuminating from them.  I looked at it for a good eight or nine minutes.  Another plane began approaching it from the north.  the craft dropped a severe amount of altitude and took off at a tremendous rate of speed.  We could hear both of the planes but we never heard a sound from the craft.;44.63993125;-123.0923625
