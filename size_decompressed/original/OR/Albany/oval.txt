Oval shaped silver object sighted in the sky at 11:45am off of interstate 5.;1997-08-02 11:45:00;7 seconds;Oval shaped silver object sighted in the sky at 11:45am off of interstate 5. I saw an oval shaped silver object in the sky at 11:45am.  I was watching it from the back seat of a car of the I5 freeway traveling north, and looked at it for 7 seconds or so. It was off to the left of the freeway.  It did not appear to move during this time. The driver pointed to the right of the car as she did not observe it.  “Look” she said, and I saw she was pointing in the opposite direction.  Unfortunately, I looked, only to observe that she was pointing to a dust tornado.  I quickly looked back and the object was gone.  Although the driver did not notice the silver object, there was another passenger in the car who saw the object as well.

Probably a meteor;2005-09-08 21:10:00;4 seconds;Probably a meteor At about 9:10pm my wife and I were enjoying our hot tub.  As I'm always looking up for shooting stars and  satelittes I saw in the south sky a object like a shooting star but much bigger. It was traveling a southeasterly direction. I saw it first and pointed at it to my wife she had time to turn her head and see it. Normally there isn't time for this if it were a shooting star.  It was about the size of my thumbnail with my arm stretched out.  It was white with a dark center it looked to have a streaming tail like shooting stars. It appeared at the 3 o'clock position and disappeared at about the 8 o'clock position. There were no sounds heard.  The only thing that bothers me is the speed, it traveling as it was slower than the shooting stars I observe. I was just curious if anyone else saw this.  My guess would be a meteor glancing off our atmosphere because it was so big.;44.63993125;-123.0923625
UFO witnessed by skeptical man and nephew in Northwest.;2011-09-28 16:15:00;3 minutes;UFO witnessed by skeptical man and nephew in Northwest. The object was an off-white oval, about 500- 600 feet in the air.  It was located in the Southern sky. The object emitted a tinsel/foil-colored flash, almost as if to catch attention.  The object was witnessed by 12 year old nephew and husband. When flash was over, there were no visible lights on craft.  This happened in BROAD DAYLIGHT! Husband was in Air force and worked at airports and initially thought the flash was the reflection from a plane turning… But it was not turning…  And there were no wings. Then he thought it could be a Citation plane because of the color, but a Citation, after turning, would look like a “T”…Not an oval.  The object hovered for about 3 minutes, and then proceeded to take off toward the south, faster than anything possible of known technology. The object just appeared to shrink away into nothing faster than a second. The object may have emitted something that would calm an individual as nephew and husband carried on as if nothing happened, and muscles felt extremely relaxed. It was only after an hour that the two realized they saw something extraordinary. Husband is extremely skeptical and still will not say, Extraterrestrial, but he will say that he now has witnessed an intelligently-controlled vehicle going faster than the sound barrier without creating a sonic boom or a need to protect individuals inside from excessive g-forces...And can travel at what he estimated to be thousands of miles within seconds!  He is shaken that he and our nephew felt the extreme muscle relaxation and almost indifference right after the object took off, only to feel the significance of the situation an hour or so after.;44.63993125;-123.0923625
