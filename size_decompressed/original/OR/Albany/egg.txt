three black egg shapes;1991-07-11 13:00:00;10-15 minutes;three black egg shapes Friend and in the parking lot of a small grocery store... noticed three black egg shapes flying in an inverted triangular formation. No visible conection between the objects. flew steadily from north to south as if on a track. The wind had no effect on thier flight. they seemed to be only 100-200 feet from the ground and less than a quarter of a mile away. As they continued on thier path, over the trees and out of view... another set of three black egg shapes came from north following the exact course of the ones prior... and another set, following those three.

In the early evening, I saw a white, egg-shaped object making its way across the sky.;1996-07-01 19:00:00;5 minutes;In the early evening, I saw a white, egg-shaped object making its way across the sky. Me, my sister, and my brother were sitting on the front porch of our house in the evening during the summer.  I remember it was quite warm.  One of us looked over to the west and saw an object flying across the sky, north to south.  It was at about a 50 degree angle from the ground.  The object had an oval, egg shape.  It looked white and had no appendages (wings, etc.) that we could see.  There were no other details or colors that were apparent on the outside of it.  It wasn't too far into the sky so that we were missing details or anything.  It was close enough to the ground so that we could see it clearly.  It had a faint hint of a contrail coming out of the end of it but it disappeared almost as soon as it came out.  It wasn't rushing but moved at a steady pace until it it disappeared from view to the south of us. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We wonder whether the object might have been a high-flying jet aircraft with a short contrail behind it, but that is pure conjecture.  PD));44.63993125;-123.0923625
Bright flashes hovering and an egg shaped aircraft went from hovering it high speed instantly.;2004-04-08 22:24:00;Bright Flashes;Bright flashes hovering and an egg shaped aircraft went from hovering it high speed instantly. I was looking out of my window and my radio went off at about 10:24 at night and i wittnessed about 4 bright flashes in about a 4 minute time period and i didnt see a aircraft but there was nothing in the sky from where the flashes came from then i noticed something moving in the sky of a egg shaped aircraft. The aircraft hoverd for about 4 minutes then went off at a very high speed and made a weird humming sound as it went away.;44.63993125;-123.0923625
