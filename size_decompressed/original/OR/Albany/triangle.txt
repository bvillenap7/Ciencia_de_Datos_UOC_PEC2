It appeared to be grey on the bottom and could of been black on the top.  It appeared to have come from a NW direction heading SE.  We watched it for perhaps 10 seconds and then it disappeared.;44.63993125;-123.0923625

It was aclear night and my nephew saw the lights first thinking they were satelites moving in the same direction and all bunched up. I finally saw them. The lights were of medium brightness and white. Medium as compared to a med. star. They did't blink at all. Twice I saw a short orange flame shoot out not far under the right rear light. This craft made no noise and blotted out stars as it went. It was a long triangle and looked strange.It just glided and went slow until out of sight. It kept the same speed and was going west to east. We saw it for about a full minute....;44.63993125;-123.0923625
We saw something unusual and unforgetable along the river in Albany, Oregon;2007-05-07 00:00:00;4-5 seconds;We saw something unusual and unforgetable along the river in Albany, Oregon On 5/7/07 somewhere around 12:30 a.m. PST my friend and I were looking at stars down along the Willamette River in Albany, Or across from Bryant Park- we were just S. of Takena Landing and were on the Western side of the river...we both agreed the next falling star would appear directly due S. of us, he thought it would fall from the East and I thought it would fall from the W...I had just turned my head back to look at the S.W. part of the sky after we had both made our predictions when he said, Wouldn't it be great if we see a U.F.O!  I've always wanted to see a u.f.o and I said, yea!  me, too! and all of a sudden, not even a half minute later, he started yelling, DO YOU SEE THAT? DO YOU SEE THAT?! so I turned my head to the E. where he was pointing and way up high in the sky I could see what appeared to be a HUGE, rectangular shape that was so wide it encompassed the width of 4 stars which were directly above the shape- I could see it changing from translucence in to a more opaque coloration and as I watched I could see what appeared to be 4 windows or panels take shape on it's side...it was IMMENSE and practically invisible, it moved like one would think of a balloon moving in a summer breeze late at night...it made absolutely no noise whatsoever and made me think it could have been made of the finest silken threads or polymer fabrics...We saw it for a total of about 5 seconds at most, as it was extremely FAST and out of our view in no time at all it appeared to follow the course of the river, heading North...My friend said that when he first saw it he saw a triangle shape emerging from the area of sky we had agreed we'd see the next falling star at, but what he saw was a triangle shape so totally translucent he could see stars through it, then he saw it make a turn N.E. and that's when I saw it...He thinks we saw a stealth bomber that was emerging from cloak...he thinks there IS such a thing as a total cloak now that goes beyond being hidden from radar, but we also feel t! hat in o rder for the thing to be SO HUGE and SO SILENT and SO FAST!!! it must have been a u.f.o....it was an absolutely amzing phenomenon we will never forget!  I realise now that for us to have thought there would be something special happening from that part of the sky there had to have been a subtle discoloration both our eyes were able to see, but which was so subtle we weren't aware of it- I think now it was like that part of the sky was lighter, as if a flash from a camera had lightened it.

Oregon UFO spotted near I-5 North towards Salem.;2016-03-19 20:13:00;20 minutes;Oregon UFO spotted near I-5 North towards Salem We were going on the highway north towards Salem.  I'm pretty sure it was around Albany, we saw a bright white light.  As we got closer we noticed it was hovering and not moving.   We passed the light and it was so close we could see intricate detail like lines on the surface.  It was extremely high tech and had three lights on each point.   After we passed it, we watched it from behind and it starting moving across the highway behind us, and had a bright white light towards our direction.  After a few minutes it disappeared.   I'm hoping someone else saw this and caught a video because my phone memory was full, and I didn't have enough time to get one;44.63993125;-123.0923625
