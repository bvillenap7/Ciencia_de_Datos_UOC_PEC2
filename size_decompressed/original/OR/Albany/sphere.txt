Glowing sphere, DEFINATELY not a plane or helicopter.;1999-08-15 23:11:00;6 minutes;Glowing sphere, DEFINATELY not a plane or helicopter. My husband, ((name deleted)), our 3 year old son and I were driving home from being at our in-laws.  We had just come from getting a soda at 7-11 on the corner of Queen and Geary in Albany.  We turned left down Pacific Blvd., the main drag in town.  We were in the middle lane in front of ((business name deleted))Motors when I spotted a large glowing sphere.  I kept staring at it, all most coming to a complete stop in the middle of the road.  I asked my husband if he saw the same thing I did.  He said Holy ((dleleted))!  What is that?  I all most hit another car driving beside me.  They saw me staring at the sky and they looked up at it.  They all most went off the road staring at it too.  We took the next immediate left, which is between a B.P. gas station and an Arco gas station.  We got to the stop sign and sat there for about two minutes watching it trying to decide which direction it was going because we wanted to follow it.  It stopped and hovered for about one minute.  Then it approached us.  So we decided to drive forward to get underneath it.  We cut straight across Santiam Hwy. through an apartment complex.  We then turned left again onto Hill St. heading south, never losing sight of the object.  I flashed my highbeams at it at the encouragement of my husband.  My son was in the back seat saying, Mommy!  Daddy!  Do you see that!  As we followed it, we saw a plane flying up quickly from the north heading south towards the obeject that was still just hovering above us.  It quickly darted south and when the plane got to where the sphere appeared to be hovering, it vanished.  It was all most as if it shut the light out.  We sat at the stop light on the corner of Hill St. and Queen Ave. looking at each other.  My mouth was hanging open and I finally asked my husband, Did we just see what I think we saw?  He smiled and replied I think we just saw a definate U.F.O.  There is no other way to describe it because it was unidentified and it was flying.  The sphere was a glowing orange-amber color.  Sort of like warm candle ligh! t.  We were amazed at the speed it appeared to have.  It was very quick.  It was quiet as well.  No noise.  I think about it now and it's giving me goose bumps.  I felt compelled to follow the thing.  The feeling was so overwhelming.  My husband was the same way.  I just wanted to get closer to it for some reason.;44.63993125;-123.0923625
Odd swarelling movement.at end of it's path.;2017-01-31 22:15:00;2 seconds;Odd swarelling movement.at end of it's path. I was walking a country road, some clouds, I saw what I think maybe a comet, but it was like falling star and then it seemed to mush around the edges like a cloud and then it swarled like a corkscrew and disappeared and seemed like vanished suddenly,  It was white, it looked bigger as it swirled and vanished instantly.;44.63993125;-123.0923625
