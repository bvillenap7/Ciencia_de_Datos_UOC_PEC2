PDT I was sitting in my family room and looked out the patio door just as a brilliant turquoise green fireball, which appeared to be approximately 5 in diameter shot rapidly from slightly northeast to slightly southwest from my home in Northwest Beaverton, OR, north of Highway 26 about 11 miles west of Portland.  It looked like a fireworks flare with the outer edges glowing like the light sparklers give off.  It appeared to be very low but there was no way of knowing.   However, the sky is overcast so it had to be below cloud cover to be so brilliant.  It was beautiful in its color, but passed within a second and totally disappeared from view.;45.4811194871795;-122.839346923077

At first dismissed as a firework mortar.  It was bright and appeared to be flaming.   It slowly traveled in an ark, then stopped.  It remained motionless for ten to fifteen seconds, then changed direction and gained in altitude until moving out of sight across the horizon.   No noise was audible nor were there any blinking lights to attribute it to an aircraft.;45.4811194871795;-122.839346923077
