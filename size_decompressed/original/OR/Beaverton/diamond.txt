strange dim diamond shaped light pattern  traveling across the sky NW to SE about 5-10 times a jets speed.;2006-05-17 22:30:00;7-10 seconds;strange dim diamond shaped light pattern  traveling across the sky NW to SE about 5-10 times a jets speed. It looked similar to the signature of a lower flying jet aircraft. However the lights were very very dim compared to normal jets into and out of PDX or Hillsboro and there was no sound at all.  There were no flashing becon lights and the direction of travel was northwest to southeast opposite normal traffic coming in to land or taking off. It was way to large a signature to be part of the normal jet traffic at 30,000+ feet we see in the direction of travel was wrong.  In addition it traveled at about 5-10 times the normal jet traffic speed in a straight line across the sky. It is unlike anything I have seen in my 45 years.  Too dimly lit and slow for a meteor to fast for jet airline and no sound was heard. To large a signature (multple light points) to be a satellite or the space station.  I have no idea what it was. Any ideas?;45.4811194871795;-122.839346923077
