B;2000-01-28 07:30:00;20 minutes;AS we left our home I spotted two large bright shapes in the southwestern sky. With outstretched arm the two shapes were lentil size. Both were suspended in the sky. At the same time we could also see fopur jets passing by these objects.  As one jet came within close range of the object furthest east that object appeared to lose control and began decending leaving a trail.  It then appeared to have recovered from this loss of control but it left a trail in the sky causing it to look like an up-side-down comma.  It then righted itself.  The jests has passed by then and one was returning from a southwesterly direction.  The two bright objects remained in the sky approximately 10 more minutes.  After leaving me at work, my huband spotted only one object in the sky and it dissappeared a few minutes later.  They were so bright they looked like small suns.  The jets were atoms in comparison to these objects.  If the jets had not left trails one would never have known they were there.;45.4811194871795;-122.839346923077
