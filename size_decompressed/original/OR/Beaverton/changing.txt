Changing shape visited, and hovered over suburban area.;2005-07-12 00:00:00;45 seconds;Changing shape visited, and hovered over suburban area. My friend and I were sitting on my porch late at night. It was summer and it was pretty hot outside considering it was a little before or after midnight. My house is in a populated suburban area on the end of the neighborhood, making it on the road. Diagonal, but in plain view from my porch, is an orchard. Its one of those random things where houses were just built around. We were eating popcicles looking over there and all the sudden I was overcome with emotion as I saw a glowing white, tripod like figure raise out of the orchard. I knew my friend was looking at it to because she was silent. If you have seen Zenon, the Disney movie, the aliens in that movie is what resembled what we saw. The only difference was it was brighter and a little smaller. It proceeded to rise about 12 feet and hover for 3 or 4 seconds. It than began to spin rapidly, turn in to a ball/disk thing and stop. It was so surreal and strange because it looked like those fake ones in movies. A circle with blinking red and blue lights on the side. It kept changing color for about 7 or 8 seconds, shot down a yellow beam of light, sucked it back up, than zoomed across my neighborhood and out of sight. It moved faster than ANYTHING in the air I have ever seen move. When it was behind the trees we heard an almost explosion and ran in the house. We both swear to this story and can each give you the exact same story. It is very strange but, when we talk about it, we get kind of emotional. I never believed in these things but now, i KNOW they are real. I know what we saw and it was real. I still to this day get funny when I see anything moving in the sky at a fast speed. To witness something like that changes the way you look at things completely and forever! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was in a long line of traffic where Murray Blvd. Crosses over Tualatin Valley Highway.  As I was sitting in traffic I observed what looked like a shiny silver balloon in the air. It was about 300-400 feet above the ground and I estimate that the size was 2 or 3 feet around. It was drifting slowly from east to west along the Highway.  After watching it for 2-3 minutes the object took off suddenly and flew west, performed a roll and changed direction to the S. W. and then rolled again and headed directly south.  When it accelerated and rolled, the object looked like the typical disk shaped UFO with a flat top that was on top of the disk shaped object.  I did not call the police or anyone to report this but I did discuss it with family immediately after it happened.

Circular-sphere-like bright white object in the sky traveling from northwest to southwest.;2020-06-01 21:59:00;2 minutes;We saw a circular-sphere-like bright white object in the sky traveling from northwest to southwest.  It changed shape but maintained a circular or oval appearance.  It moved in a somewhat non-linear path as if it was doing a part of an arc to observe us as we were playing.  It jumped up and down as it tracks across the sky before disappearing.  Dad and three daughters witness this.  Dad was playing with a glow in the dark boomerang with a flashing red-blue led affixed on it before noticing this object in the sky that was originally thought as a plane or satellite.  But realized that it was moving too fast to be one. One daughter had noticed it was able to record it partially on phone and observed that it changed from white color to red prior it vanishing.;45.4811194871795;-122.839346923077
