White-pink oval object seen & photo'd while rising up thru high cloud.;2003-07-14 15:33:00;21 min;White-pink oval object seen & photo'd while rising up thru high cloud. Walking along Canyon Road facing east, I sighted a pink-white oval canted down at left, up at right.  It seemed to be 2000 to 3000 feet above ground level, moving slowly toward me at elevation, and then began rising slowly.  I had a digital camera with me and proceeded to snap some photos, and one movie mode clip, on two separate memory cards.  The object seemed to color shift from more white to more pink, then darker pink, as it rose up into some cloud cover.  I had observed the clouds being formed earlier.  They were a combination of jet contrails/chemtrails that had fanned out into cloud, and some fast forming 'popcorn' clouds which seemed to come out of nowhere to become thicker, more dense cloud along with the jet trails.  The object changed its attitude from low at left side, to low at the right side and high at the left, in other words it became pitched in the opposite direction.  it also seemed to change size and clarity, not with respect to rising and becoming smaller, but as it entered the cloud cover it became smaller and more like a bright point of light than an oval shape.  This is also the point at which its attitude pitched over the other way, as described above.  As it rose up into the cloud cover it changed to a double oval shape, still pitched, with the lower oval magenta in color, the upper one pale yellow with a green luminous fringe, and the two ovals were separated by about half their thickness by two or three balls of dark blue color.  Size of the object was small, perhaps 1/10 of my thumb width held out at arm's length.  I had paused to take the photos, but as I had filled both camera memory cards, I put away the gear and continued walking east on Canyon Road.  The object had risen above the cloud cover, reaching a height over 30,000 feet, and became lost.  It never really stood completely still, and rose vertically and moved horizontally mostly to the west and south, but in no regular pattern, only that of its own apparent making.  It made no sound.  One aircraft! was seen flying near the object near the end of the sighting, but I had already filled the memory cards.;45.4811194871795;-122.839346923077
While driving home for lunch last Thrusday, the heavy rain clouds, had breaks of blue sky here and there.;2008-03-20 13:35:00;7-10 sec;While driving home for lunch last Thrusday, the heavy rain clouds, had breaks of blue sky here and there. As I approached the stop light to make my turn, I looked up at the light, I looked up and the blue patch of sky above the houses. Out pops this bright silver egg shaped object from the clouds to my left. It was moving very slow. I would guess, that it was 1400 -1600 yds away to the west, just under 1000 feet up, maybe a bit more. It was  very strange in that in saw completely silver , like a drip of mercury on it's side. No lights, to windows, no wings. The object much larger than an airplane in height. I scrambled for my cell phone to snap a picture and it vanished back into the clouds. Left me feeling  very puzzled as to what I just witnessed.;45.4811194871795;-122.839346923077
Bright Object seen over Portland OR about 22:00 04/03/12 with event 40 minutes duration;2012-04-03 21:50:00;over 40 minutes;Bright Object seen over Portland OR about 22:00 04/03/12 with event 40 minutes duration  500 Lights On Object0: Yes Object was seen looking northward from a location in Beaverton about Murray Scholls Road and 158TH SW.  My wife asked me to take a look the object was very bright and we have never noticed a planet or start in that position before.  The best position fix I can estimate is the object from my vantage point was at an angle of 55 to 60 degrees in altitude and about 100 degrees or 10 degrees to the west off a the  90 degrees as north.  There was intermittent heavy rain in the evening but, there was minimal or no clouds during the observations time form 21:50 to 22:40.  Object was intensely bright. If this not a planet or star and you are interested in this event I will make a detailed report with accurate location an object position data.  If this is a UFO both Sea Tac and Portland PDX should have have numerous pilot reports as well as individuals on the ground.  If it is a star or a planet sorry for wasting your time.;45.4811194871795;-122.839346923077

Flying object in sky over Sexton mountain Beaverton, Oregon.;2014-08-18 11:00:00;5 minutes;Flying object in sky over Sexton Mountain, Beaverton, Oregon. Walking up Sexton Mountain in my neighborhood also known by that name.  Came upon what appeared to be a object that was dark gray and was shaped like some.  Thought it was a drone.   A fellow walker from the neighborhood observed this with me.  She thought it was a drone but after we looked for awhile decided it was not because we did not see the other parts on it that resemble a helicopter look to it.  It hovered and she said when I kept looking at it it moved away and then back to me.   This walker I did not know.  She had come up from behind me and asked what I was looking at.  I was amazed she was even there because no one is ever on this path up because you have to be in shape.  We stared and talked and she said since we spotted it it was moving away.   When I first saw it alone I waved to it and it hovered close but it saw her before I did and it backed up in the sky.   We left the hill and she and I agreed it was a drone.  I've looked on Google all day and this evening and do not see what I saw today.  Totally weird.   I am an avid fan of aircraft and was once a flight attendant and I can usually make out these things but not this.  I totally am stumped.   My husband told me to tell this to Mr. Peter Davenport.  I hope he gets my email. Kindest regards ((NUFORC Note:  We have amended the date above to reflect a sighting in 2014.  PD));45.4811194871795;-122.839346923077
Pulsating oval object, amber and green.  Every 5 and 3 seconds, then dark traveling west to east.;2015-08-25 04:38:00;30 seconds;Pulsating oval object, amber and green.  Every 5 and 3 seconds, then dark traveling west to east. I was having a cigarette and saw several object that looked like satellites, but this particular one came across the sky differently.  It pulsated every 5 seconds and 3 seconds in different colors.  Amber and green then would go dark, then light up again.  It changed course once.  I tried to capture video and pictures, but I was only able to get one flash cycle in the video. It flew west to east altitude maybe 20-30k not sure.
