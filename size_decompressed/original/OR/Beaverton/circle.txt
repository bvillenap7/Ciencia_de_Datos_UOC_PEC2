I was standing outside, facing East, when a dark colored circle, about the size of a pencil eraser held at arms length, appearing to me to be flat, in the sense that it did not appear to be capable of reflecting light (to make a determination as to whether or not it was really a Sphere.  It's speed was slow, say small plane speed.  It was moving (in course and speed)  steadily due south to due North, I saw it only moments ago so I'm curious I if It turned or is heading up to Seattle.  The object was only at about 1,000 feet  or so, maybe lower.;45.4811194871795;-122.839346923077
Strange lights over beaverton/tigard;2012-09-25 19:32:00;19:32;Strange lights over beaverton/tigard I was going to work and I stopped briefly to talk to my neighbor, when out of thr corner of my eye, I saw 5 lights 1 bright white one and 4 smaller red ones.   At first, I thought that they were airplanes, but they crossed paths and if they were airplanes they would have crashed.  They were flying around all over the place and they were very fast, especially the biggest one which was white and larger than the others.   My neighbors came out and my family saw it to, i live on the tigard beaverton boundary so several friends in tigard also saw it.  It lasted for a good 3 minutes and then they disappeared.  I watched the 8 o'clock news but nothing came up.  All i know is that  wat we saw that day was very strange and something we had never seen before.

Blue light orb that changes colors to red and white.;2014-03-16 00:15:00;10 minutes;Blue light orb that changes colors to red and white. I was outside having a cigarette at 00:15 when I noticed something slowly but steadily rising up from the tree line.  At first I thought it was someone shooting fireworks, because it was red/reddish light with a slight streak upwards, but there was no bang.  No sound at all.  The object was hanging in the air at high altitude but below the clouds, it seems.   It was a solid blue glowing for a few minutes.  It then started strobing and changing colors. The colors were blue, red and white.  After 6 minutes it started descending again, but the lights were super bright white.  When I looked with binoculars it hurt my eyes.  I was not able to stare at it like a normal object for more then a few seconds at a time. I have taken video on my phone for 6 min 17 sec.  My wife also saw it and described that it was flashing red, white and blue.  She then got scared and went inside, leaving me there to film the remaining few minutes.  The object went down from where it came up from.  The descent was eerie and slow, with super white lights.   I lost it behind the tree line and homes behind my house.

Reddish circular object proceeded west to east by northeast.;2014-07-28 22:30:00;10-15 minutes;Reddish circular object proceeded west to east by northeast. I was just coming back from PDX when I just got to Beaverton. In the far west, I noticed a bright red circular shape that I figured it was simply a meteor.  However, during the course of five minutes, it constantly stayed at the same speed without speeding up or slowing. When I got to the corner of SW 170th and Rigert, the object slowed down while starting to pulsate color red.  The object went from the west side of the sky to the east.  After the so called sudden course change, the object proceeded to head north by north east but at a much slower pace. The course change happened by the time I managed to get up the north side of Cooper Mountain (SW 175th).  By that time it continue to slow and head northeast towards Portland.;45.4811194871795;-122.839346923077
Huge fireball split into 5 ships over Beaverton.;2014-09-19 21:00:00;30 seconds;huge fireball split into 5 ships over beaverton Around 9pm that night i was driving down hall Blvd in Beaverton when i saw a big ball of light not far up over the town of beaverton, above the tree tops but not too far up.  It seemed to have a trail behind it, it split into 5 balls of lights that made a formation at first it was a V shape but did not hold that.  They slowly started off due south and i lost sight of them behind the tree line.  I would guess the balls of light looked to be the size of a craft, or bi-plane the big ball of light they came from I have no idea how big it was.  It looked like they were this big ball of light, and once they seperated into the 5 crafts the big ball of light was gone.  The big ball of light seemed to come into view like it was raising up from the ground, when i saw it i first thought it was a gigantic firework being shot up into the sky and it had trails, it almost seemed like the crafts had trails themselves once in a while, hard to explain like when they first split up!  They had drops of liquid coming off them or something.;45.4811194871795;-122.839346923077

Orange Circular Craft and Shifting Ball of Light.;2015-08-29 00:30:00;75 seconds;Orange Circular Craft and Shifting Ball of Light. At around 12:30 am Saturday morning (August 29th, 2015), my boyfriend and I were sitting on our patio, when we both noticed the sky looked peculiar.  I mentioned how we couldn't see the moon at all and he and I experienced the first of three immense flashes of light.  We both felt this light was some sort of a scan.  It lit up evertything with a fullness and completion I have never seen before. After this flash, he and I looked into the sky above Cooper Mountain and saw a large glowing orange circle.  We both initially assumed it was the moon.  We continued examining the orange circle and realized it was the most perfectly round shape.  We sat and discussed how peculiar the air felt and in an instant the orange circle was no longer visible.  We waiting to see of it was cloud cover and it was clear what we saw vanished as quickly as it came. He and I felt quite odd.  I went inside and looked at the clock.  Two minutes had elapsed and it felt like an eternity. After researching orange circular ufo'S and other reports on huge flashes of lights, we returned outside with my cell phone. We never saw the orange circle again, but just below where it had been we saw a blue glowing light.  One could say it resembled a star.  Twinkling, gliterring and mesmerizing.  To our eyes it appeared blue or silver and would twinkle in and out of visibility and clarity. At 12:48, we experienced another flash of all encompassing light. The blue twinkle started to appear red.  It would alternate between green, blue and red. I recorded video on my Samsung Galaxy phone camera.  My camera was focusing on this object, clearly focusing. Upon closer examination we discovered the following variety of shapes and colors:  1) Blue rectangle  2) Red cylindrical  3) 2 green speheres.  My boyfriend and I repeatedly asked one another for validation.  We saw precisely the same things. During our time simply gazing up at the object it moved slightly right to left, flittering it seemed, and from it we saw smaller balls of light flying off and we saw these smaller balls return to it and hover close to it and again fly off at a speed unfathomable to our minds. The last huge flash of light was around 1:30 am. The object in the sky was gone at 1:45 am. My boyfriend and I felt an electric energetic sensation well into the night, and I found it difficult to take my eyes off the sky.;45.4811194871795;-122.839346923077

They appeared from the due west one by one then gradually each disappeared in the same order they appeared.   We are both professional people and know the difference between a plane and helicopter and these orange steady glowing objects were definitely something different.;45.4811194871795;-122.839346923077

I live in an area where air traffic going to and from Portland airport is a constant appearance and I know what an aircraft looks like. The object with the multicolored lights is definitely not an aircraft coming or going from the airport. I have never seen anything like this object and I would like to know if anyone can explain what it is?;45.4811194871795;-122.839346923077
