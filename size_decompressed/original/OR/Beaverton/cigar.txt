DAYTIME SIGHTING long, black, no features, like a pencil, no sound. no lights.;1981-10-15 16:00:00;10 sec;DAYTIME SIGHTING long, black, no features, like a pencil, no sound. no lights. I only decided to report this because of a program I watched on T.V. a few minutes ago. I was just getting of work in the late afternoon. My co-worker was also off, I was on my way to my car in the parking lot. It was a very clear evening and I had just glanced up. The building where we work is situated on a hill so the view is beautiful, anyway I looked up and I saw it. It was moving steadily but low above trees. It had no lights, no wings, just like a long black pencil but rounded on each end. It was a long ways away so I couldn`t see any detail. The wierd thing was it made no sound at all, that`s what really spooked me. When I saw the T.V. show a police officer also reported the light he saw made no sound, and I remembered what I had seen that day back in 1981.  I remembered asking my co worker to look at it, and he was amazed too. It moved so quickly from horizon to horizon and was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Multiple cigar shaped objects flying around each other then shooting across the sky.;2007-03-22 19:00:00;2-3 mins;Multiple cigar shaped objects flying around each other then shooting across the sky. At around 7:00 pst, my girlfriend and I were outside looking at a rainbow here in Beaverton, Or (Near Portland). We witnessed about 7-8 what I thought were white birds flying around each other at one of the ends of the rainbow.  They were flying pretty low, it is very cloudy here. I looked closer and thought, wow they are flying around each other fast, and moving very strange to me.  Then 2 of them just shot to the other side of the sky.  Didn’t see where the others went, it happened so fast. They appeared to be cigar shaped and metallic.  No sound whatsoever was heard.  I watch planes fly every single night out here, and have never seen anything fly this fast. We were so dumbfounded.   I don’t know if it’s related, but 10 minutes later a very loud jet flow over.  We were inside when we heard it.  I went out to see if it was a military jet but it was too cloudy to see.;45.4811194871795;-122.839346923077
