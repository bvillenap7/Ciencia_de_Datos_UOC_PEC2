saw  a couple of strange air craft;2003-01-28 23:07:00;2min;saw  a couple of strange air craft While in my back yard  my brother in law and myself noticed some strange looking air craft off in the distance ,as  we looked closer they both came closer to our location upon looking further we noticed that they where both lit up, and spherical in shape. At first we thought them to be helicopters, but as they got closer you could not here the usual helicopter noise.  It sounded mechancal but not like a machine that you could reconize nor  did they appear to look like a  craft that I nor my brother in law has ever saw before. And no they wernt planes. I called my wife just as they where leaving and she got a short glimpse of them.;45.4811194871795;-122.839346923077
Shiny Silver Half Sphere with bright light reflecting underneath floating around Beaverton Mall, Oregon;2008-11-23 14:45:00;1 minute;Shiny Silver Half Sphere with bright light reflecting underneath floating around Beaverton Mall, Oregon Clear blue sky driving to work.   In front of me was one shiny silver half circle object floating in the sky.  Like a half circle but more pointy at the top.  It appeared to have lights underneath but looked more like the sun reflecting off of it very brightly on the left and underneath.  It just hoverred there.  It was way too big to be airplane.   I had trees on both sides of the street but the object was very visable and large in the blue sky.  It was at horizon level.   I took a left and the tree went in front of my view.  I pulled over and then could not find it anywhere in the sky.  It was gone.   It was so clear and so large.  It is unexplainable.  It was a UFO.;45.4811194871795;-122.839346923077
The images were not seen till photos were looked at.  ((NUFORC Note:  We see what we believe are lens flares.  PD));2018-03-25 12:55:00;Photo;The images were not seen till photos were looked at. My wife and I were taking pictures of the sun's halo with our cell phones.  After we were done we went into the house.  While relaxing later I reviewed mine as the sun was sort of in my eyes so I was snapping photos blindly and wasn't sure how they turned out.  I see a blue planet like spot on two of my photos.   The first  photo shows no object, the second photo shows the object just outside the halo, the third photo shows the object much further away from the halo.  I understand this could be something from the sun as we were looking towards the sun as see by the photos.  You will note as per the photo, info I sent all three were sent within a 60 second time frame. ((NUFORC Note:  We see in the photos what we believe are lens flares.

Bright white round object flying in an easterly direction.;2018-07-21 21:40:00;20-30 seconds;Bright white round object flying in an easterly direction We have witnessed this object fly over our house for several years.  It does not appear every night and does not appear at the same time each sighting.  When it does appear, it is usually shortly after sunset to no later than 2 hours after sunset.  We had not seen it for several months. It generally moves east though it may be moving slightly northeast or southeast. The intensity of the white light does not change even after it passes over and goes out of sight so it is not a landing light or spot light.  The light does not light up anything below it or around it.  It does not pulse at all.  The light is perfectly round.  There are no other lights visible such as the red and green directional lights on the side an aircraft or a beacon light 1that would be on the tail of an aircraft.  There are no strobe lights.  It leaves no trail. It is completely silent.  We have never heard the sound of an engine, rotor, prop, or buzz like from commercially available drones. We have no size reference for it other than it is much larger and brighter than a star such as Sirius.  We have watched satellites and the International Space Station go over and this makes them look like tiny little pale pinpricks in the sky. We have no real speed reference though we think it is moving at about the speed of a passenger jet, possibly faster.  It does not change direction, stop, hover, etc., but flies in a straight line.  We have no idea what altitude it is flying at which makes it harder to try to determine a speed or a size. We are both pilots and are stumped at what this is.;45.4811194871795;-122.839346923077
