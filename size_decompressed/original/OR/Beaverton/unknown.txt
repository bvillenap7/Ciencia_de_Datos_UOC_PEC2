UFO looking like a star flew overhead.  Only one sighted.;2006-09-06 21:00:00;30 seconds;UFO looking like a star flew overhead.  Only one sighted. UFO was seen shooting across the sky faster than an airplane, but took 30 seconds to get across my line of sight.  Knew it wasn't an airplane because there weren't any flashing lights, and it was too fast for an airplane.  It seemed to be at least 1000 feet higher than an airplane would usually fly at, and there was no sounds.  Complete silence.  Little white dot in the sky.  Looked like a star, but it was moving.  Only one ufo sighted.;45.4811194871795;-122.839346923077
Large object with hot pink glowing light in front and turquoise blue light in back descending with no trail and disappeared at dusk.;2007-03-31 19:45:00;10 seconds;Large object with hot pink glowing light in front and turquoise blue light in back descending with no trail and disappeared at dusk. I was on my 2nd story deck, which is about 3 stories high, and it was not quite dark when I looked to the North East and saw an object that appeared to be falling out of the sky.  What was odd, was that it seemed to be a long enough object that it had quite a space between it's lights. A very bright hot pink burning light at the front of it, and a bright turquoise blue light burning at the back of it with a decent sized space in between the lights which gave it the appearance of being a long object.  I thought for sure it was a plane going down, but there was no smoke and no trail like a meteor.  It was low on the horizon and didn't travel a great distance, but I had no idea how far away it was.  It seemed large in proportion to the normal air traffic I see in my horizon.  I yelled to my guest...____, Come here quick! and it was still visible while I said that after I spotted it, so I know it had to be visible for at least 6-8 seconds before it just disappeared.  I've seen lots of meteors in the daylight, and the colors of this object and the distance between the bright colors made me think for sure it was an aircraft going down. However, it just disappeared with no smoke and no sound.  About a half an hour later, a large helicopter hovered in the sky for over 30 minutes in the general direction I had seen the object, and then the helicopter just took off to the West, almost over me.  By then it was dark.  There was no sound that I heard from the object, and it did not leave a trail at all even as it flew through the sky and appeared to be going down right before it disappeared in a clear sky.;45.4811194871795;-122.839346923077

2 Bright lights flying in formation, or maybe ONE craft. Got them on Video.  ((NUFORC Note:  ISS orbiting with Space Shuttle.  PD));2007-06-19 22:00:00;1 min. 2 secs;((NUFORC Note:  ISS orbiting with Space Shuttle.  PD)) 2 Bright lights flying in formation, or maybe ONE craft. Got them on Video Two very bright white lights traveling in unison as if flying in formation, but not changing distance from each other at all. We believe it was two lights on one craft. The lights came from the West and traveled SE before they just disappeared.  I went to MUFON and reported it, and learned within 24 hours the same objects were seen in Nevada, Ohio, Missouri, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Colorado, California, Wyoming and by us here in Oregon.  The time zone we are in, pacific and the times the other sightings were reported indicates that there were more than one of these crafts.  It has to be huge...to us, we were assuming it was 2 objects, but we did entertain the notion that it was ONE big craft with two lights by the way it moved and the lights stayed so steady and perfectly spaced.  No sound, no blinking lights.;45.4811194871795;-122.839346923077

low flying objects over beaverton OR.;2008-07-20 05:30:00;30to45min;low flying objects over beaverton OR. I was on my way home from work exiting highway 205 and walker rd. when at the stop light turning west I see was clearly a strange object to the southwest.I immediately pull off and exit the car. Opon exiting  I noticed a second object that was stationery just a white dot. The main object was redish oringe with two lights on each end but would chang to a sold white line that was the same length. It moved around the stationery dot andclimbed in altitude while movin to the north. Note every  time a airplane was in the area it held its position. I watched this for about 30to45min . at about 20 minutes after first seeing the white dot  it just disappeared but the main object  kept moving north.Note The Wind was blowing south. After it was to far to really see well I got back into the car to go home. When I get home i'm still watching the skys excited by what Ijust saw. Looking up on my way inside I see the white dot above and RUN into my apartment to get the camera. I go back outside as fast as I can and snap two pictures of the white dot above .Just after I take the second picture my neaghber comes outside.I looked to her and told her what I was doing an the white dot was gone.But I did get two pictures of the white dot ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

Daylight UFO Sighting ove Beaverton - White light flickering and fading in and out of visibility;2012-07-30 17:40:00;10 minutes;Daylight UFO Sighting ove Beaverton - White light flickering and fading in and out of visibility I was relaxing on my back porch on a reclining chair and looking up at the sky.  It was a clear day with just a few small clouds in the sky.  I noticed a white dot on the sky that appeared to change brightness from fairly dull to very bright.  The object was floating in the sky and appeared to drift slowly away from my position (I first noticed the object approx. 3 - 5 miles away and it appeared to be at least 2-4000 feet in altitude.)   I initially thought it was a mylar balloon reflecting sunlight except it began to exhibit strange behavior.  The object was moving away from mt location towards the NW.   After about 2 minutes it appeared to stop moving and got very bright.  It then would change brightness from very bright to almost invisible. The next thing that happened was probably the most interesting.  After about 2 minutes the object changed direction and started to move back towards me.  It continued to vary in brightness but also started to dissapear for about a second and then it would re-appear in a slightly different position, moving across the sky now parallel to my position (moving from North to South). As the object got the closest to my position, I could see a silver round shape with what looked like a black shadow on the bottom (only visible as the light dimmed).  The object was still several thousand feet up in the sky. I continued to watch it for about another 45 seconds and then it just vanished, not to be seen again.   I walked around my backyard continuing to look for it but was unable to see it again.;45.4811194871795;-122.839346923077
Multi color lights pulsing and flashing on object.  ((NUFORC Not:  Sirius??  PD));2014-12-14 04:45:00;27 minutes;Multi-color lights pulsing and flashing on object. I went outside to smoke it was quiet no sounds.  I noticed a flashing light that would change color.  Blue, red, Amber, white.  Then pulse those colors.  It was hovering I would guess couple thousand feet up difficult to tell it seemed close enough to film. I have several video clips of it and pictures.  I have no idea what it was.  I have seen something similar in March of this year.  The best description would be it looked like a police car with all the lights on. It moved very slowly as to mistake it for a star or perhaps camouflage to look like a star.  It was not a star.  The pulsing and flashing was constant.  Changing colors.  I have high powered binoculars that I used to see it closer.  It hurt my eyes to focus very bright lights changing colors fast.  No semetirical shape I was able to see due to strong lights.  I have no clue what it was but I hope others have seen it as well. ((NUFORC Not:  Sirius??  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
