After work (two AM in the morning) I left walking home from the fast food restraunt I worked at on Hillsdale Highway.  Walking home I take the usual route Hillsdale Highway then SW Scholl’s Ferry Rd. then home a few more turns afterward.  But that walk home, I stumbled to an extraordinary amazement in the night sky.  Sometime between 2 AM and 3 AM in the morning I was standing on the side walk next to Raleigh’s Elementary school staring at an awesome site above me.  In the sky above me I saw a fleet of UfOs coming from the moon into our airspace miles above me it was extraordinary.  These lights were all in a coroneted formation heading north.  Aircrafts looked bright and cylinder in shape and there were perhaps 1000 that I was seeing.  They all looked as if they were going fast maybe 65 mph or 70. They all disappeared behind.  The artificial clouds that were scattered far apart in the sky. It happened on December 7th 2009th.  Event Lasted less than 25 minutes.;45.4811194871795;-122.839346923077
Several stationary flashing lights were observed hovering over Hillsboro near the airport, Hillsboro Stadium area. ((anonymous report));2017-12-21 17:57:00;10 minutes;Several stationary flashing lights were observed hovering over Hillsboro near the airport, Hillsboro Stadium area.  Three of the lights were larger and brighter and more constant than the others, all flashing lights were on the same lateral level (distance from the ground).  The other stationary lights would come and go with a cluster over Hillsboro, there were two on each end of the cluster and about the same distance from the cluster one which would have been over the Beaverton Tigard area.  There were approximately 8 stationary flashing lights in the cluster.  Video was taken with a time date stamp, the duration was 10 minutes.  The lights stayed in formation, in that they did not change places.;45.4811194871795;-122.839346923077
