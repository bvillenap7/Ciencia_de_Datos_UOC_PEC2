Triangle shaped, 3 lights, at night, gliding over the city, seemed transluscent in a way;2000-12-04 19:00:00;20 seconds;Triangle shaped, 3 lights, at night, gliding over the city, seemed transluscent in a way Date/time is approximate..since I only wrote this down later from memory... I never have considered myself as destined to sight a UFO, but did I? The other night I heard a jet passing overhead.  I looked up.  It was low but...the distance wing to wing of it's lights was small.  I can't guess how high it was but it answered a question I had been considering for a few weeks now.  This craft was not super high up and not low...and I could hear it clearly over the road noise.  And the distance, wing to wing of its lights was quite small.  Why is this important? A couple weeks ago I was about to enter my home.  I live in the suburbs. It was a very clear night.  Stars could be seen.  The city lights obscured the horizon though.  I looked up.  At about 45 degrees I saw something. I say something because I stared at it and could not figure out what it was.  I ran every explanation and captured as much detail about the experience in my head as I could because I knew I would be trying to recognize what I saw for some time. Hold your arm out at 45 degrees.  Spread your index finger and thumb apart.  This is the approximate distance tip to tip of two of the lights on this thing.  The front light, making a triangle, was not way out in front.  It made the shape of a  hangglider, not a jet.  There were 3 lights in this triangle shape.  The lights moved synchronous with each other so I assumed that they were attached to the same object.  Given it's wingspan I figured it was either very low...or if high...it was very big... If it was very high then it was larger than any aircraft I could even conceive. If it was very low then I should hear the noise of whatever was powering it. It was totally silent...not a bit of noise...it simply floated by.  It could have been a hangglider but it's movement didn't suggest that and there was no hill and again no sound from a motor so it would be governed by the wind...it did not suggest this...besides what idiot would do this in the dark? The thing simply cruised across the sky at a steady speed..not fast..not slow.  Making absolutely no noise.  It took a matter of about 20 seconds for it to move from me spotting it above me until it just vanished into the horizon lit by the city lights....it just sort of faded into the lights. I had an idea that between the 3 lights there was a craft yet it seemed like I could see thru that part to the dark sky behind it.  Since I was in the city and the stars...although visible, did not fill the sky...I had no means to determine if I could see the stars thru the craft or that there was a solid mass between the lights which would block out the stars. That's about it.  I keep replaying this happening for me in my mind. Over and over.  Trying to determine what known flying object that could have been.  I never dreamed that I would ever be destined to see a craft from another world...but now I'm reconsidering that.;45.4811194871795;-122.839346923077
Triangle craft motionless in sky  with three bright lights and one strobe seen in Beaverton, Oregon 9:00 PM May 5 2007;2007-05-05 21:00:00;10 minutes;Triangle craft motionless in sky  with three bright lights and one strobe seen in Beaverton, Oregon 9:00 PM May 5 2007 I was driving north on Highway 217. Saw the object in a large patch of blue (most of the sky was dark except for the patch I was looking at).  It was not terribly high in the sky.  First saw the object a short distance after entering the freeway from the Walker Boulevard on ramp, southbound.  The object seemed to be just sitting there, seemingly not moving.   I slowed down as I drove, to determine whether it might be moving, or whether it appeared to be standing still simply because I was in motion.  Slowing the car down didn’t make a difference.  The object continued to maintain its position. The object looked like a triangle, seen head on (that is, a triangle flat on its belly, with the tip facing front). Very bright lights:  brighter than I’ve seen on any jet. One very bright light in the front, two others forming a V-formation on either side, but rather closer to each other than far apart. Also, another bright light strobing, but I could not tell its exact location. It occurred to me that it could be a delta wing flyer I’ve heard about from time-to-time. As I took the exit ramp onto Denny Blvd., I lost sight of the object. I tried to exit to a high place to keep observing it, but I was no longer facing in the proper direction to see it.;45.4811194871795;-122.839346923077
Black Triangle Fly-Over (Beaverton, OR);2008-12-29 18:05:00;10 seconds;Black Triangle Fly-Over (Beaverton, OR) General Description of the Event:  I was heading to my brother's house on the evening of Monday December 29th, 2008.  At 6:05pm I was driving west on SW Taylors Ferry Rd. toward SW Washington Drive when I saw a strange set of lights fly overhead.  These lights fit almost perfectly the description of a Black Triangle, three white lights creating an equilateral triangle with a single red light in the middle of the other three.  I could not make out any structures on the object. I slowed down and almost stopped my car as I watched it go behind the trees.  I felt the urge to follow it but the speed was too great to match in a residential area and it was traveling in a direction I could not easily follow.  In all I saw the object for about 10 seconds before it went out of view.  I immediately drove to my brother's house a few blocks away and told him what happened.  We went outside to look but did not see anything else. My Thought Process:  At first I thought it was a low flying plane and thought nothing of it.  Then as it flew overhead I thought, Hey, that looks like the general description of a black-triangle UFO,  I should figure out what type of plane has those light patterns so I can debunk it, and began consciously trying to make out a conventional aircraft shape and patterns.  As I failed to make out any familiar aircraft to go with this light pattern I began to realize I might be looking at something much more unique. Object Description:  Four lights total three white lights creating an equilateral triangle and a fourth red light at the center of all three.  All the lights were steady with no flashes or pulsation, constant brightness.  They did not move in relation to another.  These lights were pointed down toward the ground, they were not pointed forward (as might be typical of an aircraft flying at night). The white lights appeared around the same color temperature and appearance of a typical halogen bulb.  The red light appeared to be white light that had been filtered to red.  Although vivid, it was not monochromatic (such as a red LED or laser light), it looked more like a red-filtered stage light.  There were no strobe or marker lights. I cannot say for certain what the body/structure of the object looked like.  It was dark with little ambient light surrounding it and none of the light emitted was self-illuminating.  I would like to say I saw a black triangular structure but I cannot be certain.  However, I was consciously trying to match a airplane shapes and patterns to what I saw and failed. Size was approximately 30 ft between each white light. Object Flight: 10-15 degrees West of North traveling with constant speed, direction, and elevation. Approximately double the tree height, so around 200 ft above ground.  I would estimate speed between 60-80 MPH. It seemed to keep perfect alignment with the horizon with no visible rolling.  Object was leading with an edge of the equilateral triangle created by the white lights, while the final point of the triangle was pointing in the direction opposite of travel. Other Notes: I was in the car with the music on and windows up.  I did not hear anything unusual as it went overhead.  I have a Camaro with T-Tops, so I could watch it fly overhead through the t-tops. There were no electrical or any other disturbances as it flew overhead. My Background: I am a 23 year old male. Graduate of Mechanical Engineering.  Native of the Beaverton area in which the sighting occurred.;45.4811194871795;-122.839346923077
Equilateral triangle with 6 lights on underside;2018-08-13 03:40:00;10-12 seconds;Equilateral triangle with 6 lights on underside This is the first time I have had a UFO sighting.  What I saw was not my normal.  This occurred in the early morning hours of 8/13/2018 at about 3:40 a.m.  I had awoken about 3:00 a.m. and decided to go out on my deck in the backyard to see if I could observe the Perseid meteor showers, even though I was in the brighter city limits. Constantly looking straight up to the sky, I had been outside about 40 minutes when I had the pleasure of seeing two meteors.  I was about to call it good and go inside when I glimpsed a very intense bright white light coming over the roof line to my south.  My first thought was jokingly Oh, this ought to be a great meteor, and then my mind instantly realized, of course, it better not be a meteor!   In the seconds I had this thought and was still looking up at the white brightness increasing and moving over the roof line, I saw an equilateral triangle shape of 6 round-shaped white lights arranged in 3 rows (one in leading front, two in next row and three in last row) - no pulsating or different colors.  It appeared to be a set of 6 lights moving in perfect formation and unity I could not see an outline of a structure or frame that contained the lights but I had the sense the ‘edges’ were rounded and not sharp. I could not see the top of the craft, I only saw it from underneath so I don't know if there was a dome or viewing window(s).  I guesstimated the size around 9-10 feet. It moved slowly over the space above me at a level and steady pace, making no noise, and moving from the south to the north near the tree line - which I later estimated to be about 100 feet high. It did not light up the ground area which remained dark.  The entire event took about 10-12 seconds before I could no longer track it due to it disappearing through the trees in the yard.  My thought was what the heck was that?  I stayed outside for about 5 more minutes before going inside as I started feeling a little uneasy.  A couple of days later I reported it to the Oregon Mufon Group.;45.4811194871795;-122.839346923077

Quiet morning of August.  While passing under a short tree, I noticed a noise.  Like a fan.  Soon I noticed there was a triangular hover craft type of drone flying about 500 feet in the air.  I ran after it but it soon disappeared and headed SW.

Triangle UFO moving west;2020-12-28 17:35:00;10 minutes;Triangle UFO moving west At approximately 17:35 on December 28th, 2020, I was heading home from work on Tile Flat Rd between SW Scholls Ferry Rd and SW Farmington Rd.  After passing the intersection with SW Clark Hill Rd I noticed what appeared to be three white lights appearing to mark the outside corners of a solid object at about 25 degrees above the horizon.  I was unable to stop on that road to get any pictures. I turned onto SW Scholls Ferry Rd heading west.  I went through the intersection at SW Road Bridge Rd and could again see the object.  By this time, it had lowered to about 18 degrees above the horizon and was quite noticeably further from me and continuing to move slowly away. I turned onto Highway 219 northbound and drove for about 1 ¼ miles and was able to find a safe place to pull off the road.  The time was 17:48.  The object was visible about 8 degrees off the horizon just above the coast range mountains.  I was able to get a little over three minutes of video of the object.  The camera I used was unable to get a clear image, but it appears to clearly show at least the three corner lights.  The one closest to me was the brightest with the other two being visible, but dimmer.  I tried pointing to it for people driving by, but apparently I was unable to catch their attention to stop and view it.  After I stopped the camera, I tried to reach it with a 5 mA blue laser with no reaction.  I was able to see it periodically for about the next ten minutes, but then it disappeared below the horizon.  The sighting lasted from 17:35 to about 17:55.;45.4811194871795;-122.839346923077
