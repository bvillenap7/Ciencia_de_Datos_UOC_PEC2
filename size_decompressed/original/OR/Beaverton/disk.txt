Will never forget.;1970-06-22 14:00:00;10 minutes;After exiting a Fred Meyers store.  I noticed a disk shape with slightly slanted sides that had rectangular shapes that changed colors.  I believe reddish, orange and a bright greenish yellow mix color.  It was hovering approximately 1500 feet away from me over homes in our suburban area and was approximately 600 feet above.  I remember it having a low pulsing hum sound.  I ran home and told my mother whom didn't believe me but my insistent begging made her leave and walk down 2 blocks to see for herself.  I seemed like she was gone for 2 hours as I waited at home as she instructed me to do.  When she returned she simply said it was nothing!  Coincidence or not but around the same time she was diagnosed with schizophrenia caused by hormonal changes.  As I think back to that 2 hour time frame, I remember looking out the front door and all I recall is seeing a haze that was sunlit I guess you would say and no vision of even seeing the neighbors homes or the street!   Though I was younger I know what I saw and will never forget it.  And though it may sound odd, I have awoken and sat straight up in bed many many times to the humming sound? I have tried searching sightings in that area but not knowing exact dates, I haven't found anything!  Well, that's my experience.

Craft above power Lines;1996-08-01 00:00:00;90 Sec;Craft above power Lines I have thought about reporting this sighting for years, started to report it many times then decided not to.   Late Summer in 1995 or 1996.  My wife and I were laying in bed watching television.  Our bedroom was located on the second floor of the house with a sliding glass door leading to a second floor sun deck looking over our back yard.  At our fence line there is another back yard a home then a street and then a green way with power lines running down the middle.  Around midnight I got up to turn the television off and close the sliding glass door.  I turned off the TV which darkned the room.  I turned to close the door and about 150 yards away there was a huge object with colored lights just sitting above the power lines.  The lights were not extremely bright but the object was clearly visible.   I said to my wife come here fast.  The best way to describe the object is oval shaped.  Smooth on top and bottom with an area in between.   On both sides the top and bottom came together and were rounded downward. The object began a slow 360 degree turn.   We could clearly make out windows, and what looked like tubes and barrels stuck to the sides of the craft in the area between windows and the top and bottom.  I guess you could describe it as plumbing.  The window were lit soft white but I could not see in.   This thing was probably three football fields across.  I remember thinking I wish I had a video camera this thing was there and right in front of us.   We could see it perfectly.   It finished it's 360 degree turn about 50 feet above the power lines and then just shot away at about a 2:00 angle and was gone.   The green way is located on SW Johnson Street between 209th Ave and Cornelius Pass rd. in Aloha Oregon.  This object made no sound.

Object appeared in the west, moving very fast in a south easterly direction. it was a dish shaped object, did not appear to have lights;1999-08-03 22:00:00;30 seconds;Object appeared in the west, moving very fast in a south easterly direction. it was a dish shaped object, did not appear to have lights on it,a white glow in a clear sky,  there was no sound ,object was very easy to see could not have been a satelite, no visible edges, just a smooth surface On Tuesday night, August 3rd, 1999, my husband, a friend and I were watching for satelites about 10:45 PM.  We noticed an object appear in the west moving very fast in a south easterly direction. It was not a satelite, as we watch them nightly.  It was dish shaped object, and did not appear to have lights on it, just somewhat of a white glow in the clear sky.  We watched it go as far south as we could see.  It was a very clear night and the object was very easy to see. This could not have been a plane as it was traveling too fast ....and we do not believe it was a satelite as it was lower than any satelite we have seen and there was no reflection like you see with satelites. There was no sound at all, just a vaporlike glow to an otherwise solid object.;45.4811194871795;-122.839346923077
Bright white discoid at high velocity seen passing behind a commercial jetliner during ascent;2000-03-24 13:35:00;1.5 min?;Bright white discoid at high velocity seen passing behind a commercial jetliner during ascent I was standing on the loading dock where I work smoking, and was observing a commercial jetliner (I believe a Super-80) flying west to east, still ascending from takeoff (approx 15000 feet and climbing). I noticed a bright white object approaching the rear of the jet from the west, at about 5 times the speed of the aircraft. At first I thought this to be a seagull at a much lower altitude and viewed from the side. Within seconds, I observed the object pass behind and above the jet, indicating that it was at a much greater altitude than I had first assumed it to be. As I watched it closely, it came to a sudden stop with no apparent deceleration, and hovered for less than a second. It then reversed its course and flew west at an outrageous speed. For a brief moment, I saw it dip slightly to one side, revealing it to be a circular shaped object. It accelerated out of sight in less than 1 second. The object may have had a reflective surface appearing to glow white because of the bright sunshine today.;45.4811194871795;-122.839346923077
SILVER SAUCER;2009-03-08 19:00:00;ten minutes;SILVER SAUCER i WAS IN MY YARD LOOKING AT THE CLOUDS WHEN i NOTICED ABOUT AN OBJECT THAT LOOKED TO BE FLOATING. i OBSERVED THAT IT WAS ONLY ABOUT A MILE UP. BUT , i COULD NOT FOCUS ON THIS OBJECT. i THOUGHT IT WAS DEBRIS OF PAPER OR A KITE. i WALK AWAY, TO GET MY BINOCULARS. AND, i FOUND OUT WHY THIS OBJECT WAS HARD TO FOCUS IT WAS ROTATING AND FLIPPING. THROUGH THE BINOCULARS i COULD CLEARLY SEE A SAUCER. ABOUT FIFTY FEET IN LENGTH. IT, WAS SILVER IN COLOR AND HAD A SINGLE RED LIGHT. i CALLED MY WIFE MY SON AND OUR HOUSE GUEST OUT SIDE TO SEE THIS SAME OBJECT IT WAS JUST FLOATING TRAVELING SOUTHWEST. BUT, GRADUALLY UP . AFTER, ABOUT TEN MINUTES OR SO THE OBJECT WAS VISIBLE ABOUT TEN MILES OUT OR FURTHER. IT, BLINKED A WHITE LIGHT AND WAS GONE. the object was about 50/60 feet wide;45.4811194871795;-122.839346923077
Near invisible saucer cruising through the night sky;2012-08-12 01:58:00;10 seconds;near invisible saucer cruising through the night sky The craft was saucer in shape with a clear exterior that seemed to almost completely fade with the color of the sky. The craft was traveling at a constant speed and completely straight due south/southwest. I noticed the craft while scanning the sky for meteors, and when I pointed the craft out to my friend he immediately saw it and tracked it with me the remainder of its path. The craft took between 8 to 10 seconds to travel about ½ ways across the sky before it faded into the southern sky.  Being a complete rookie, I am estimating that the craft was cruising at about 15,000 feet. I know for sure that the craft was inside our atmosphere. I am a 21 year old just getting my life together and my friend is still in high school. No one believes our story. Our location was in the exact center of the elementary school field just up the hill from where i live. Errol Hassle Elementary;45.4811194871795;-122.839346923077

At dusk, after work, I saw a golden, metallic saucer-shaped object in the sky.  It came from the south and was probably at 1,000 feet.  It was silent.  I thought it was a floating mylar balloon until it stopped in mid air above the Sklyline mountain range (Portland Zoo area).   I got a very good look at it.  It looked like two drum cymbals welded together, and may have had a blue glow beneath.  Incredible.   It hovered for about a minute.  I struggled to get my cell phone powered up, looked up and it was gone.  I'm still shaking.  I don't intend to tell anyone.

Silver disk flies through sky making zigzagging motions at 2:30;2015-04-16 02:30:00;5-8 minutes;Silver disk flies through sky making zigzagging motions at 2:30 I was sleeping over at my friends house, and we were going to try to pull an all nighter.  We were all just sitting on the beds talking to each other.  My friends bedroom was really big, and had a huge widow about half the size of her wall.  That night we kept the curtains open. Just about everybody had Fallen asleep, except for me and another one of my friends.  We were just sitting there, and I glanced out of the window.  I remember seeing something flying around out there.  At first I thought it was an airplane because of the light flashing on it. But it couldn’t have been because it wasn’t flying in a strait line like a airplane normally would. It would fly in a zig zaggy motion and loop around.  I just kept looking at it, trying to focuse on it.  I told my friend what I was seeing and told her to check it out.  When she looked out the window she saw it too.  We weren’t sure what to do, so we just kept watching it.  After maby a minute or two of watching it, it quickly flew away.  The shape of the ufo was a disk shape, and we couldn’t really make out a color besides silver because it was dark out.  One of the observers has always been interested in space and what it out there.  They have never seen a ufo before, and wasn’t really into it before the sighting of it.  The other observer moved here from japan, they didn’t even believe in paranormal activity until now. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It seemed to split into two pieces, with a smaller circular piece falling toward the ground.

I tell my husband to pull over, grab my phone and just as I start to taking pictures, it drops these 2 fireball looking things from it.  The fire-looking light on the objects dropped, extinguished within a couple of seconds of dropping.  The aircraft never stopped flying and continued South until out of our view.  I caught several pictures on my phone.;45.4811194871795;-122.839346923077

When it flew over Sexton Mountain Park it dropped 2 fireball looking things from it that burned out within a couple of seconds. It continued to fly South until it was out of our view.  I caught it all on my cell phone camera and once the objects fell, you can clearly see a hole in the center of the object.  Never seen anything like this before.;45.4811194871795;-122.839346923077
Massive green rotating disc-shaped lights over Portland;2016-11-23 22:30:00;60 seconds;Massive green rotating disc-shaped lights over Portland. Looking eastward over the lake/reservoir at Progress Ridge near the Beaverton/Tigard border, two male adult friends and I observed in the distance three radio towers situated in the West Hills that separate downtown Portland from its Western suburbs.  It is important to note that the cloud cover was low, but not low enough to obscure any portion of the radio towers in the distance.  I'll take this opportunity to say I don't believe what we saw was fireworks exploding within the clouds. In the clouds that appeared to be over the West hills and said radio towers we observed first a massive green light that rotated counter-clockwise.  It was orientated as though it was parallel to the ground, and made perhaps only a 90 degree rotation until it disappeared but was replaced (within one second or so) by the exact same shape, only this time in an incredibly quick burst of yellow, then orange, then red colors acting in the same manner. Some 20 seconds later, the exact same reen shape and light occurred again, rotating in the same direction and for roughly the same short amount of time, perhaps a few tenths of a second shorter. Next, only the yellow-colored shape appeared, not the red nor the orange. The object certainly appeared to be concealed precisely within the clouds that were illuminated by the city lights of downtown Portland, but they were absolutely distinct from those city lights. It reminded me of the handheld game Simon Says the way the colors changed from one to another, and the nature of the colors was reminiscent of the the taillight of a car, as if there was a membrane containing an inner light-producing object. There were also a larger number of aircrafts in that apparent area of the sky just before the lights occurred. Perhaps this could be explained by the vicinity of PDX airport, but the aircraft seemed to remain in the affected area for a far longer time than one would expect of any aircraft approaching the airport.  They also seemed to be physically closer to one another than is seemingly typical for civilian aircrafts.  I am no expert in aviation by any means, but it seemed as if they were flying in formation, sort of like you'd see whenever those F16 (or various fighter jets) fly overhead every so often (they didn't sound like fighter jets, I might add.)  The object appeared to be massive, but seemed to be deliberately concealed by the cloud cover of the late evening. Finally, I believe it is important to note that my two friends and I instantaneously grabbed one another by the sleeves of our jackets and stepped backwards, and all of us admitted to immediately feeling a sense of fear and dread, like you sometimes experience when in the woods and you feel like an animal or another person is nearby but you can't see them.  (I don't say this for dramatic effect, and I don't want to appear sensationalist, I just think it's important to note the immediate sensory reactions we experienced when we saw these lights.)  They did not return after their second episodic light show, but the cloud cover over downtown Portland did seem noticeably brighter than before.;45.4811194871795;-122.839346923077
Hat-shaped tan object caught on cell phone camera by accident.;2017-05-04 15:00:00;Not sure;Hat-shaped tan object caught on cell phone camera by accident. I was coming out of my doctor's office, and I knew it was going to storm when I went in at 2pm.  It was 87 degrees and uncomfortably humid.  I had been watching the sky for lightning on my way to the doc. As I was coming out of the parking lot, a huge raindrop hit my windshield.  It was so big I tried to get a picture of it with my phone.  I glanced up in the sky to see if there was a big storm coming.  I saw an odd circular area in the fluffy clouds in a clearing.  I saw only a circular swish of a white cloud and nothing else but blue sky behind it.  I always call those sucker holes for pilots, but this one had a swirly cloud inside it. It wasn't until I was in bed that night looking at my photos to see if I captured tge big raindrop on my windshield.  My daughter was in Hawaii and I was going to show her she was missing giant rain here at home in the Portland area, and a stormy muggy day. When I looked at my photo, the raindrop is there, but much to my surprise, so is somethibg odd in with the swirly swish cloud!  It looks to me like the shape of the Trent UFO in McMinnville, and this is not far from that area mileage-wise. I thought maybe it was a dirty spot on my window, but my window is clean and I can clearly see this object is blurry like it is moving fast.  There is even some light reflecting on the left side of it in the photo like it is reflecting off an object.   I have no clue what appeared in my photo, but here it is!;45.4811194871795;-122.839346923077
