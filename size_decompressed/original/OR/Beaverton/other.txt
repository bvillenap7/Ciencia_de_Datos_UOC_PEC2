Four Silver Objects;2005-09-09 11:35:00;5-10 sec.;Myself and a co-worker were driving west on Tualitin Valley highway about 11:35AM, about 200 yards before the turn to 141st street I saw four silver objects motionless in the sky. As we drove closer I could see that they were not balloons. There were low clouds so I had a good background to judge distance and size, maybe 400-500 feet in altitude, about 25-35 feet long. The wind was blowing pretty good but the objects were completely motionless against the moving cloud background. They had a strange shape, almost looked like silver acorns! They had what looked like a seam where the bottom of it connects to the top but were rotated 90 degrees so they that were laying on their side. I got a good look at them for about 8-10 seconds before we had to turn. We came back the other way about 20 minutes later and they were gone. I drive this route everyday. Not very dramatic, just some odd things hanging in the sky.;45.4811194871795;-122.839346923077
Brilliant with varied shape, blinks out and moves to another part of the sky in one second before blinking out again.;2006-08-26 00:54:00;Seconds;Brilliant with varied shape, blinks out and moves to another part of the sky in one second before blinking out again. Only saw for about 3 or 4 seconds. I was driving east facing Portland on Canyon Lane.  The object was above Portland's West Hills close to Sylvan. It caught my eye as I cleared some trees. Whatever it was looked brilliant, a silver white light.  The shape varied in it's dimensions.  At that point I was trying to figure out what I was looking at, when it just blinked out!  Then came back in about a second, a good distance from where I first saw it.  I was amazed at how fast it had moved! I'd never seen anything like this in the 25 years driving on weekend nights after work. Then it blinked out again and I lost it. I continued to look as I drove but never saw it again.;45.4811194871795;-122.839346923077

Two objects seen over Portland;2007-08-18 19:40:00;10 minutes;Two objects seen over Portland A friend called me to look to the NE about 45 degrees. I observed an object that looked like a two rounded cubes connected and slowly rotating while rising very slowly. I could only see it with binoculars. There was a second object farther away at 11 o'clock to the closest object. Definitely not kids balloons. The reason my friend called was that he saw 3 jets from the Portland airbase flying around a couple of dots in the sky. I didn't see the planes but I heard them. At the distance I saw the closest object, I would say it was about the size of helicopter, but I have no reference point to be certain.;45.4811194871795;-122.839346923077
