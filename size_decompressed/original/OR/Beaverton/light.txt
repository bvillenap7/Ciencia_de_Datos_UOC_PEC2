3 people saw 3 flickering orange lights moving slowly away from each other.;2001-03-10 23:30:00;5 min;3 people saw 3 flickering orange lights moving slowly away from each other. About an hour ago I was leaving my friends' house and as I walked outside, two orange, flickering, fire-colored lights in the sky to the south immediately caught my attention. They were too small to discern any detail. They were about as bright as a typical airplane, but seemed a little bigger. I called my two friends outside to look, but they didn't get outside in time to see anything. I watched the lights for about 30 seconds total. They were about 40 degrees above the horizon, about 1 handspan at arms length apart from each other. I believe the one on the left was stationary when I first saw it, then it started moving slowly to the left away from the other one. (It was moving w.r.t. the clouds behind it.) It moved a total distance of about one handspan. The one on the right was stationary the whole time. Both lights faded out about 30 seconds after I first saw them. I saw nothing remaining after they faded out, and I never heard any sounds. I noticed that a car had stopped down the street.  After the lights faded out, the car drove over to the three of us and stopped. There was a couple in the car who had been watching the lights as well. They said they had seen them from the nearby freeway, and had pulled off to watch. They said they had watched for about 5 minutes total, and that there were three lights initially. Apparently this third light had started out stationary and then slowly moved to the right, away from the other two lights and disappeared before I had come outside. We all agreed that they were much more orange than the red broadcast tower lights visible to the east, and too orange to have been red airplane lights. The couple speculated that the flickering orange color looked like fire and may have been candles tied to balloons, except that all three were moving in different directions, which seemed strange. There's a very slight, variable breeze outside at ground level, and the clouds aren't moving noticeably w.r.t stationary objects. The weather is cloudy--no stars visible--and the lights were below the clouds. When they disappeared I couldn't tell if it was because they entered the clouds or because they faded out. There's a lake about a quarter mile to the south. I didn't think to ask the couple how far away they thought the lights might have been. Maybe it was just a prank, but I figured I'd report it in case anyone else saw anything unusual. I would guess that others probably saw it too since it was visible from the freeway. Background of the observer: I'm a 32 year old software engineer with a computer science / electrical engineering bachelor's degree.;45.4811194871795;-122.839346923077
3 Red nocturnal visitors seen in Washington County Skies.;2001-03-12 21:00:00;10 minutes;3 Red nocturnal visitors seen in Washington County Skies. Upon leaving work in Beaverton, Oregon, about 9:00pm or so  (Murray and Mullikan), I noticed three red lights high to the northwest.  They looked like red flares, yet were moving independantly, so it was not the wind.  They were in sort of a taper Isoceles triangle with a single light separated from the other two by an order of 4 of the separation of the others.  I observed them for about 8 minutes when I pulled into a service station just next to US26 on Murray.  When I mentioned the lights to the attendant, he said he had been watching them for over a half our and they had started out in the Southeast & had moved to their current location over a span of about 10 minutes.  The objects appeared to extremely high up so no sound was eveident.  As we watched two of the objects came towards one another and became one, or one went out.  The others just seemed to fadse away after a few moments, though there was a hint of rapid motion just before disappearing.;45.4811194871795;-122.839346923077
I saw three, big yellow lights in the south that didn't move.;2001-03-13 21:15:00;ten minutes;I saw three, big yellow lights in the south that didn't move. On monday night, 3/12, I was driving home from work about 9:15 pm. I was driving west along Cornell Rd when I noticed 3 bright lights up in the sky to the south.   The lights were almost overhead. It was very clear that night and these lwere very noticable.  They were close together with two next to each other and one to the side.   They had a distinct yellow color to them and were unlike stars.  I thought they must be planes, although flying awfully close together.   As I watched for about ten minutes, the didn't appear to be moving. I have nevr before seen such big and bright stars in that section of the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and she was provided a very credible description of the event.  We at first thought she was describing the three orange/yellow objects witnessed over Puget Sound on the next night, but she now believes that the sighting she experienced occurred on the prior night.  However, please see other report from Oregon for 13MR01.  We have amended the date here, but it is only a guess.  PD));45.4811194871795;-122.839346923077
3 ligkts seen floating up Hwy 26 at aprox. 9:30 PM, looked kinda orange and connected to each other!;2001-03-13 21:30:00;5 min;3 lights seen floating up Hwy 26 at aprox. 9:30 PM, looked kinda orange and connected to each other! They were sort of hanging in the sky and didn't look like the rest of the sky!  Then as we slowed way down on the freeway, as did the car putting on their brakes in front of us to watch as these strange lights came closer.  They were I would say traveling at a speed of say 60-120 mph about 200-500 feet above the freeway and appeared to be following the freeway!  As they went directly over our car I rolled down the window and looked up at what seemed to be 2 lights about say 4-6 feet apart making up each of the three lights which were traveling in a line with the first one lower then the second higher and the last one being the highest.  They just kind of floated of down the freeway.  They didn't seem to move away from each other at all as if all part of a much larger unseen craft.  I called the Hillsboro Airport and they said they had no reports of any strange lights that night and acted disinterested.  I was going to let it go until I saw the other posting in Beaverton.;45.4811194871795;-122.839346923077
I was observing a very bright Star or planet , it  began  moving!;2005-06-30 04:00:00;1 -2 min;I was observing a very bright Star or planet , it  began  moving! I was standing in my back yard doing some early morning star gazing and playing with my new binoculars. It was just about 4 am when i fixed my sight on, what i thought to be, a very bright star or planet. My binocs were not focused so i took a second to adjust, then looked back at the object. I just had my binoculars focused when i noticed the object started to move. My heart started beating real fast as i watched it pass directly over my house. The object was a brilliant white point in the sky larger and brighter than any sattalite or planet I have ever watched in the sky. The object moved on a straight path from West/N.W. to East/S.E. It made no sound and, from my best quess was at an elevation   equal to or slightly higher than airliners at their maximun cruzing altitude. The object had no other lights blinking or otherwise that i could see, it was traveling at a very high speed. As soon as it passed over me i ran to the back door of my house and started to pound on it, my body tingling from my adrenaline rush, i had to get a second opinion or maybe just have someone else see it too.  The door opened and i pointed to the sky and said so, tell me what you think of that, I was wathing it through my binocs , i could of swore it was stationary, they all of the sudden it was moving!! The other person said I dunno, Ive never seen anything like that before. I continued to watch it as it dissapeard into the sky it didnt go over the mountains and disappear, it sort of faded in the distance then abruptly disappeard. I then jumped on-line and tried to find a website that could tell me about sattalites and their course they fly. I found a few that sould have been in the area at the time but none with the heading i observed, but i am an amature when it comes to  interpereting the information on the websites. What did I see?;45.4811194871795;-122.839346923077
Bright white light traveling from west to east that suddenly disappeared.;2013-08-20 21:05:00;1 minute;bright white light traveling from west to east that suddenly disappeared. Right as we were stepping out of the restaurant in Progress Ridge mall, one of the kids noticed a big bright light traveling from west to east that was directly over us. He called it out as a UFO.  As we looked up, I agreed with him that we weren't looking at an airplane. There was a plane flying south that was near it.  It gave us an idea of how large the object was and how fast it was moving.  A bit larger than the small passenger jet that was flying south.  I estimate it at about 3000 feet.  Looked to be flying at about the same speed as the jet.  We noticed that it was moving away from us and that it had no sound and the bright light was completely white.  Like the north star. In fact, it resembled a bright star in many ways. A friend made the comment that the light could probably be seen from 365 degrees.  It wasn't a directional light.  We compared it to the small jet and it was clear that it was flying slightly higher but was much brighter.  It also d! idn't have any flashing lights.  As we commented on the differences between the plane and the object, the object disappeared completely!  It was insane and proved to us that we weren't seeing an airplane or helicopter fly by.  The light went dim for about a second and then was gone. We were all very impressed and excited with what we had just seen.  There were 12 people in our group and all witnessed it.;45.4811194871795;-122.839346923077
4 vertical aligned red lights in south/southwest sky.;2014-02-22 20:20:00;4 minutes;4 vertical aligned red lights in south/southwest sky. I was driving to the store, when in the south southwest sky I saw 4 lights a good distance from the horizon line that were in a vertical alignment.   they drifted slowly up from the horizon, with no sound, 2 seemed to combine or get very close together and one by one they disappeared as if traveling in the opposite direction.   i searched on youtube and found that the same ligths had been captured a month ago.;45.4811194871795;-122.839346923077
Red and Green non strobe light travel at altitude and then suddenly drop beyond sight.;2014-07-27 23:45:00;5-8 seconds;Red and Green non strobe light travel at altitude and then suddenly drop beyond sight. I saw solid red and green lights (non-blinking)traveling south with the appearance of high altitude.   The craft dropped verticle at a rapid rate at 80 degrees beyond the tree/roofline.  No sound made whatsoever.;45.4811194871795;-122.839346923077
Bright airplane-esque light, slow moving, no blinking, fade out.;2015-08-17 21:20:00;2 minutes;Bright airplane-esque light, slow moving, no blinking, fade out So, weird sighting twice now in the sky, want some opinions and to see if anyone else has seen anything similar.  First sighting was by my mom, I wrote it off as a comet.  This was last week sometime.  Second sighting was just a few mins ago, and we both saw it.  It's low enough in the atmosphere that I thought it was a plane. No blinking lights, plus the entire thing emitted a glow.  It was traveling rather slowly, no trail, and it was witnessed for about one minute.  It was a giant ball of light moving from west to east.   At the end of the sighting it got to be very bright, then dimmed to red, and then faded out of sight completely.  I've seen comets and shooting stars, logically I cannot connect those dots.  It wasn't a commercial craft or drone, and it was silent.  Any other guesses I'm not considering?   Oh, also, it wasn't one of those Asian candle paper lamp thingies either.  I've seen those released numerous times and they move all about, flicker, and glow and are nowhere as large as what this was.  This was really bright, like the incoming lights of a plane, but traveling much more slowly, without noise, without blinking.  I am stumped.  Any guesses??;45.4811194871795;-122.839346923077

The other 2 were flying at the same height as the bottom two on he trianle just south.   I saw them for almost 5 minutes, went inside for about 30 seconds and they were gone when I came back out.;45.4811194871795;-122.839346923077
Pulsating lights in SW sky over Beaveton/Farmington area.;2015-12-18 05:00:00;15 minutes;Pulsating lights in SW sky over Beaveton/Farmington area. I opened my front door which faces west and a pulsating light in the southwestern sky caught my attention.  It changed from white to orange to green to blue at the same time I know that sounds weird.   I stood and watched it for about ten minutes when a second one appeared above the first one, both pulsating the same colors.   It drifted about 5 degrees in the sky towards the horizon and I lost sight of it at 15 minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Bright unidentifiable flying object that faded to blend in with the sky.;2016-08-16 19:00:00;2 minutes;Bright unidentifiable flying object that faded to blend in with the sky Seen a bright light at the corner of my eye.  I looked up and there was a bright star like object moving in the sky.  It was visible for more then a minute then it started to blend in with the sky and totally disappeared.   There was still daylight, so I don't believe it to be a star, and the way it fade to blend in with the sky was weird.  After the object disappeared, I seen what seem to be a fighter jet headed in the same direction.;45.4811194871795;-122.839346923077
Star moving in all different directions near Beaverton, Oregon;2020-07-25 03:15:00;>25 minutes;Star moving in all different directions near Beaverton, Oregon On July 25th 2020 at 0315 my fiance and I were in Beaverton, OR looking NE into the sky.  We witnessed for at least 20 minutes a UFO slightly above the horizon.  It would move from left to right and up and down very slowly.  Then it would disappear and reappear.  It disappeared about 3 times just to reappear again in a different spot above the horizon.  We also witnessed very fast streaks of light moving side to side near the UFO.  I am 100% positive that it was NOT an airplane.  Airplanes can't move in the manner that this craft was moving.  It just looked like a star...  A star that moved in weird directions, disappeared and reappeared several times.  It was still there when we went inside. My fiance was cold so we went indoors.  I saw my roommate a few minutes after being inside, I then told him about what we had seen.  My roommate and I then went outside to see it.  As soon as we stepped outside, I pointed it out to him and it just looked like a star.  Ho! wever, it started to move to the right and then disappeared again.  I'm not sure if it came back or not, we both went inside after seeing it.;45.4811194871795;-122.839346923077
