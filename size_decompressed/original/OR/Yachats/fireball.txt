A 'fiery ball' motionless over the Pacific Ocean.;2015-02-24 06:00:00;15 minutes;A 'fiery ball' motionless over the Pacific Ocean At 6:07 am, I was looking over the Pacific Ocean, to the northwest, and noticed far in the distance a fiery ball in the sky.  Too low to be a star or plan, too high for a boat light.  I notice it was in one spot then would move very slowly to the left, stop, move slowly more left, stop.  I even saw it go up in a circle and to the right a little.  I watched it for almost 15 minutes (till 6:22 am), and it faintly disappeared in the west.  Again, this object was motionless- Wasn't moving (hardly) at all. The ISS was suppose to be flying over our area (fit the sunlit description), but not until 6:40 am, viewing in the south and I am sure it wouldn't just 'stop' and hang out.  I was thinking maybe coast guard, but it seemed to be too high to search and rescue No jet or airplanes fly over that early and wouldn't stop mid-flight?!  What else,  A falling star?-  wasn't moving fast enough!;44.3277;-124.0824
Large bright object moving very fast toward the ocean.;2019-06-28 10:12:00;30 second;Large bright object moving very fast toward the ocean. We saw a bright light.  Moving at an extreme speed, it was large in size and flew until It vanished above the ocean.  It appeared to be a distance away but I am unsure.;44.3277;-124.0824
