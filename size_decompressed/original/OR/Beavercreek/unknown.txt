On October 6, 2020 around 8pm pst, my husband and I saw an unusually bright white, fast moving object very high in the sky.  As we were observing, there was what what appeared to be a meteor falling, that looked like a shooting star except is was moving up instead of falling down.  This object was “shooting” in the exact direction of where the moving white light had been, which was no longer visible.  Then a few seconds later there was an extremely intense, blue white light “explosion” for lack of a better word. It was concentrated right in the area where the two previous events took place and did not light up a large area of the sky. It looked like what I would think of an exploding star would look like here on Earth.  We live in a rural area that is very dark and quiet. There were absolutely no sounds that we heard associated with this event. I made note of the constellation Pegasus as reference to where we saw this take place.;45.2576;-122.4725
