A basketball size from our distance. Spinning clockwise and gonig in s straight line for miles.  Than  started upward at a 90 degree angle towards the moon for as far as we could see and than disappeared.  Dark gun-metal in color.  Nothing seemed to interfer with the direction it was going, wind or anything, always on straight course. Basketball size, moving foreward motion, spinning clockwise, moving straight ahead.  Seem to know as if it knew where it was headed. My daughter, age 11 called me mother, age 44 to the window stating that she was looking at a UFO.  I came over to the window seeing the same object.  At first thinking it was a baloon floating in the sky and them noticing that there isnt a baloon on earth that could travel like this object. Moving in a straight line. Wind or anyting could not change its course.  We watch it for arounf 10 minutes, couldnt tell you how fast it was traveling.  Then it took a 90 degree angle path upward towards the moon.  It was still daylight outside but the moon was visiable in the sky.  The day was in the mid 70 degree temp. and the sky was as clear as it could get.;45.492615730337;-122.415958426966
Bright circular object  seen moving in a South to North direction fading in and out of sight, and difficult to pick up by binoculars.;2001-07-01 16:30:00;5-10 minutes;Bright circular object  seen moving in a South to North direction fading in and out of sight, and difficult to pick up by binoculars. One object was seen moving slowly (more slowly than a plane would move) from South to North in a straight line.  It was small and bright and seemed to be at a high altitute.  It went in and out of sight either due to the reflection of the sun, or rotated out of sight.  We obseved with our natural eye, then tried to pick it up with binoculars.  That was difficult but one of us was able to see it briefly through the binoculars.  It appeared to be a bright circular (unenclosed on one side), and seemed to move faster when observed through the binocular and hard to keep in vision.  It disappeared when it got almost straight overhead, and we could not pick it up again.  We observed it for 5-10 minutes (estimate, starting about 16:30-16:35 and lasting  until about 16:45.  We are in our early 60's, post graduate educated. ((NUFORC Note:  Please see report from Marysville, WA, for same date.  PD));45.492615730337;-122.415958426966
Below cloud line circular bright red glowing object possible small white middle rotating- AMAZINGLY CHILLING!;2005-06-11 23:30:00;7 minutes;Below cloud line circular bright red glowing object possible small white middle rotating- AMAZINGLY CHILLING! I am from Portland, Oregon and my nephew video taped a sighting at approx 11:30 Saturday night 6/11 along with nearby neighborhood witnessing of a bright red glowing circular shaped object that might possibly have a small white spiraling center and near the end of the siting which lasted approx 7 minutes  it protracted and retracted like a sea urchin (unsure if cell phone disturbance or what) and then shot back up into the sky.   Every one was freaking out, called 911, a neighbor policeman called dispatch.  The object was below the cloudline.  It was about the size of a dime visual from the ground and with his video camera zooming in you could see actual shape and graphics about 1/2 dollar size.   What I don't understand is why - when this happened two nights ago- has this not been aired on the news.  There were reportings outside this neighborhood of the same sight from Washougal WA etc.  How could this not be news worthy.   NBC (our channel 8 will be getting his video tape today).  It looks like a planet that someone taped from a high powered telescope not a home video camera locally.  After seeing it on video I can't get the image out of my mind and my wondering why this kind of thing does not explode all over the news.   It has indeed shaken up my reality. Could you reply or forward this to someone who can answer this for me?   Sincerely,  ((name deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  One of three reports of apparently the same object.  Please see other reports.

6 amber circles forming a diamond shape moving fast in the sky.;2013-07-31 21:40:00;15;6 amber circles forming a diamond shape moving fast in the sky. TherE were 6 circular amber colored circles.  They formed a diamond out of four of the lights, and two were behind the diamond cluster, almost like a tail.  It moved toward the hill behind us quickly.  Maybe 10 minutes after three more amber circles passed by swiftly.;45.492615730337;-122.415958426966
Seemed like invasion.   ((Starlink satellites?));2020-10-28 05:30:00;30 minutes;Seemed like invasion Was throwing out garbage then looked up, I thought the stars were moving and then I caught myself stars don't move like that!!!  I looked closely and saw a formation of circled shaped objects all in one very long line following a path, all moving and shinning, these were not orbes and definitely not stars. I counted 60 when I finally reacted and ran to get my cell phone to record!!! This event was very scary, I thought if an invasion exists this looks like it, I have to report it! I called Sherriffs office and 311 but no one answered! I left a message no responce. So here I am making this report online.;45.492615730337;-122.415958426966
2 circular aerial objects observed over Gresham Oregon 4/23/21;2021-04-23 20:30:00;5 minutes;2 circular aerial objects observed over Gresham Oregon 4/23/21 Friday night 8:30 while in Gresham, OR. Winco parking lot we observed 2 of these objects 2 minutes apart moving on same path at relatively low altitude approaching from the west and casually turning Northeast. When approaching we could see yellow orange colored light NOT flashing. When they turned the lights disappeared and we saw a perfectly circular totally black object. It was dusk so there still was some background lighting but this did not resemble a helicopter or plane I've seen. There was no noise from them we could hear. At about 8:35 an airliner was coming in low for approach to PDX to the west. The second object like the first continued NE in a straight line and appeared to fly underneath crossing the plane. I first wondered if this was a balloon but it moved too fast and precisely and considered maybe an ultralight but too fast and they're very noisy but the totally black circular shape was something I have never seen and I follow aviation. My wif! e did capture a still image of one of the objects approaching from the West which is not an approach pattern for planes flying to Portland international airport. That still image shows the lighted object. There's also a video taken after the 2nd object made a turn Northeast though it was easy to see with the naked eye the video may be difficult to see the black circular objects without enhancing because of parking lot lights obscuring the image at dusk. Still pick and video can be submitted if requested. I will note there is a municipal airport in Troutdale Oregon which was in the general direction these objects were moving by the time we lost sight of them moving past the shopping center. The proximity of the second object apparently flying underneath the approaching airliner at low altitude was particularly concerning and they appeared quite close to the point where the FAA should take notice. I would be curious if Portland international or Troutdale airport or the airlin! e reported the object approaching.;45.492615730337;-122.415958426966
