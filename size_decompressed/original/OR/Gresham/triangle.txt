Am trucker, kept catching glimpse of lights thru trees as driving east. Not much traffic.  Looked over toward trees just as the bottom of the aircraft turned down to face me with one corner, just across the lanes of the westbound freeway.  Huge, silent w/laser type red rays emitted from opening that went deep inside craft. I could have parked my truck in that opening with a 2-3 others. Never heard anyone discribe one this close, nor the lasers from nose before. This is not my first UFO - but it was definately of the Closest Kind and felt ominous, not friendly as if trying to intimidate - following my movement in a slow turn (I was almost at a crawl by then)No other traffic. Then it slowly turned to the west and I could only make out the big dark triangular shape - no lights, or sound but it was out west of Portland's PDX in no time. More/next night and one month later. I couldn't get your number from the Seattle operator at the time - I tried when I got home.  They are out there often, but have lights in the shape of an airplane turned on underneath so you can barely make out the triangle shape against the sky, for the brightness of those lights. They always are headed West,NW.;45.492615730337;-122.415958426966
Red triangle shaped object with red lights sighted over Gresham ,Oregon.;2005-06-11 23:00:00;30 min;Red triangle shaped object with red lights sighted over Gresham ,Oregon. What we saw was an object with about 12 large red lights which made the shape of a triangle or tear drop, it hovered about 1000 feet up in the sky, our nieghbor reported it was over the houses once first spotted, putting out sparks and sootlike material. he reported he saw it there for 10 min then it gradually drifted to the east about a mile from our culdesac, this is were I first spotted this object. It hovered in this spot, absolutely silent at this time I had my family come out to witness this object. Then it moves a little more to the east. and could no longer be seen from the back yard. We moved to the front of the house into the culdesac where it was spotted again, severial neighbors were already in the culdesac watching, another was just returning home and was flaged down by this writer to witness this. the U.F.O hovered in this area about 1 to two miles to the east,then very slowly appeared to go straight down and could no longer be seen.;45.492615730337;-122.415958426966
UFO's recorded from my RC airplane.  Debunk this!;2014-03-18 15:00:00;Seconds;UFO's recorded from my RC airplane.  Debunk this! Recorded from my remote controlled airplane.  At least 2 small orbs & 1 larger triangular craft filmed descending and ascending at incredibly fast speed.  Noticed a strange glimmer in the sky when I was flying my plane, got home and remviewed my footage and this is what I recorded.;45.492615730337;-122.415958426966
Three neon green lights turned on and shot down to the water faster than anything I've ever seen;2017-12-14 03:45:00;1 second;I was driving west on Marine Drive at 3:45 am.  The Columbia River is to the right and very close to the road when heading west.  About 100 feet ahead of me and off to the right over the river is where I saw what I saw.  About 50 to 100 feet above the water, three neon green lights turned on and shot down to the water faster than anything I've ever seen move in my life.  Honestly it scared the crap out of me.  I thought an explosion was coming. I even remember bracing for impact.  Instead of any kind of explosion (or a splash which I wouldn't be able to see because the river was dark at the time) the three neon green lights that formed a perfect triangle quickly faded out.  The entire incident only lasted for maybe a second or so.  The green color reminded me of the color electricity makes when it arcs. At least in my mind anyway. My after thought was that it was maybe a asteroid or shooting star, because of how it moved towards the water.  I quickly ruled that out by the way it just turned on right above the river, instead of falling from the sky downwards towards the water.  Also the three neon green lights formed a perfect triangle.;45.492615730337;-122.415958426966
