I saw what I thought was a very low, slow plane. It was hot, my window was open in my truck. I saw what I thought was a very low, slow plane.  I heard no noise at all and watched while I was stopped for a traffic light. It was a large ink black X with five steady sort of dim looking white lights. It was moving with the V part of the X forward, or leading. There was one light in the center of the X where the Is meet, and one at each end. The distance to the craft was about 120 feet above and to my left. I saw it clearly. It was approx. 90 feet across. I could not see for certian how thick it was. It was not any type aircraft I have ever seen. I didn't hang around. I don't wish to be known. I had not been drinking, or other.;45.492615730337;-122.415958426966
