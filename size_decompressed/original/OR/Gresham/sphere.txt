White orb like object heading west towards portland from gresham;1980-07-29 23:15:00;5 secsonds;White orb like object heading west towards portland from gresham Flew across the sky heading in westward direction.  It was white in color and moving 3 times the speed of an airplane.  It lasted for about 5 to seven seconds before I lost sight of it.  It was about the size of a nickel in the sky and was at a low altitude about 500 ft.;45.492615730337;-122.415958426966
Noticed a marble sized (from my viewpoint) black object just hanging in the air.;2007-07-21 05:40:00;10 minutes;Noticed a marble sized (from my viewpoint) black object just hanging in the air. It was roughly 5:40 in the morning, and I was on a day off from working the night shift.  I went out onto my front porch to have a cigarette when I noticed a marble sized (from my viewpoint) black object just hanging in the air to my upper-right.  I watched the object while I smoked, and noticed the sun shimmer off of it's right side.  I then realized (from the sun shimmer) that the right side had a flat angle.  I continued to watch the object as it just hovered in the sky motionless.  I then decided to grab my Sony Handycam to get a zoomed look, and to record it.  However, my camera was out of battery power after time-coding a tape for a video editing class I took about 6 months earlier.  I then watched as the object very slowly moved out of my eyesight, and into the distant clouds.;45.492615730337;-122.415958426966
UFO seen over Gresham, OR.  It was a black orb that  was tumbling through the air at a high rate of speed.;2009-09-11 19:32:00;4 solid minutes;UFO seen over Gresham, OR.  It was a black orb that  was tumbling through the air at a high rate of speed. I was standing in my street playing football with my two sons, 13 and 10.  My 13 year old and I were standing next to each other talking and it was abnormally quiet outside.  As a matter of fact, it was so quiet, I could hear the high school band playing at the Friday night game which is over a mile away.  I need to preface this email and state that I am a professional at trade and without giving up my occupation, let's just say my credibility is very high.  Anyway, I was standing next to my older son and I happen to look up and coming from the east was an object.  What I couldn't understand is why this object was moving so fast.  As it drew closer, the process of elimination in my mind quickly narrowed it down to a UFO.  By no means am I a believer in the whole alien conspiracy thing but I have NEVER seen anything like this before.  I quickly yelled at my son and told him to look.  My son quickly looked up and said, dad, what its that.  At this point, I w! ent into defense mode because I could not explain away what I was seeing.  This object was sort of like an orb.  Based on the altitude, I was say it was about 8-10 thousand feet up.  It was black however it TUMBLED through the air.  I could see this thing rolling and the sun was going down and at one point, the object reflected light and it illuminated the object better.  I have NEVER seen anythings like this before.  What was even more strange was the object was not emitting ANY sound.  It was dead silent and at that point, you could hear anything.  We live within 15 miles of PDX airport in Portland, Oregon and I know the flight paths of airplanes that come and go.  This thing was moving at a VERY HIGH RATE OF SPEED and in a flat east to west direction.  I have never believed in UFO's in the past but I will now argue with any skeptic till I'm blue in the face.  We were able to watch the object as it maintained the same altitude and speed until it many miles away.  My son a! nd I are changed people.  We have not stopped talking about it! .  The o bject is scared in my mind and again the strangest thing besides its speed, and shape, was the fact it did not emit any sound whatsoever.  It literally tumbled through the air and was basically rotating around itself.;45.492615730337;-122.415958426966
