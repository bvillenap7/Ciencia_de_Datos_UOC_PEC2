Three bright flashes appeared in the north sky within a 10 second period;2003-01-27 19:00:00;10 seconds;Three bright flashes appeared in the north sky within a 10 second period Standing outside and the entire sky to the north lit up bright green, then darkness, another flash appeared light colored with some pink and purple.  Then the sky went dark again and another flash appeared, mainly all white.  The clouds were still, no wind was lowing.  The clouds were sparse, not enough for lightning nor was there any sounds of thunder.  It was completely silent, the air was still.  We could not have been the only ones to witness this. ((NUFORC Note:  Exploding power transformer.  We spoke with several witnesses, one of whom reported back that a transformer had exploded.  PD));45.492615730337;-122.415958426966
Super bright flash of light a week after a wave of UFO sightings;2016-02-20 19:30:00;2 seconds;Super bright flash of light a week after a wave of UFO sightings. With a friend in front yard having a cigarette.  The sky was partly cloudy with a pretty consistent mass of light cloud directly overhead when a very bright noiseless flash occurred directly over us. It was from straight overhead and lit up my neighborhood evenly.   Like a massive flashbulb going off. There was no thunder before or after.  No sound at all.  And there was no lighting either before or after.  The big flash did not look like any lightening I’ve ever seen and I have experienced a lot of lightning. The only reason I am writing about what MIGHT be assumed to be lightening is that it occurred a little over a week after a major wave of UFO sightings that myself and many others along the West Coast witnessed and as illustrated on the home page of NUFORC’s site. Has any other witness of the major wave on 02/10/16 seen anything like what I describe above since that big sighting?  Seen a big flash of light or anything else?;45.492615730337;-122.415958426966
