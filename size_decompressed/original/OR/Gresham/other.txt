Two drone like objects chasing or observing a star like craft or object that was faster and more silent then any other craft or object;2011-08-04 22:10:00;2 min-5min;Two drone like objects chasing or observing a star like craft or object that was faster and more silent then any other craft or object PLEASE READ CAREFULLY, I WAS AS BREIF AS I COULD BE BUT JUST PLEASE LISTEN THAT I WOULD NEVER LIE ABOUT SUCH A THING BECAUSE I TAKE THESE THINGS VERY SERIOUSLY!!!   It was just after sundown and my brother and I were smoking by the poolhouse in our backyard which we have a very clear and brief veiw of the sky from.Just for plot and setting of this sighting I live right next to the only airport in portland and i know planes and military and helicopters, jets etc. I noticed my stepfather staring in the sky and i had a very weird feeling in my gut that just hit me when i saw my stepfater. I asked him what he was doing and he stated that he heard on the radio that a man has spotted several strange lights and activity goin on and that he saw something strange a night before and that he has a weird feeling which was similiar to mine. First we saw a strange and solid, small but fast object with no light and it circled the region of the sky and disappeared. Two more objects just like the first object came from the same direction and in my own perspective they (floated) but flew the same direction and vanished as well. As my stepfather and brother were trying to make out what they were or are which in their words were (drone) like objects, I spotted a flash in the corner of my left eye and a star like object with a bright light not blinking came from the direction the (drones) were last seen and the star object was moving rapidly in a curve like direction going south and cleared the sky from were it was spotted to the southside in a matter of seconds and then and i pointed it out to my stepfather sayinghey what is that look it is moving so fast what is it. The light made the object look like a star but no star can move so fast and out of place.It was so far but so close that we should have heard a sound like planes make or jets but it was dead silent. A flash of light came from the star like object and it vanished in the opposite direction from the (drones). As we were baffled at what we just saw and somewhat speechless, the (drone) objects came back from the direction they left and were moving not as fast but rapidly towards the direction of the star like object but the star was nowhere to be seen again. I waited for 30 mins to try and see something again but nomore activity came besides the normal of living next to the airport. I believe in ufos and aliens or beings or what have you but i would never think of seeing something as strange as i saw and having the feeling that my stepfather and i felt when it happened. I watch alot of history and tv and am a huge fan of ancient aliens and shows of that sort but really just the theory of existence in our galaxy but i think the hoaxes and fake reports are stupid because i thought i would never live to see something unusual but i have and i know for a fact that it was real and was getting away from whatever was chasing it and succeeded substentaly. It was the fastest thing i have ever seen in the sky and i know planes and military jets planes etc. The star object was not from this world and i have strange feeling something is happening or is goin to happen soon i dont know what or when but i hope someone listens to me because there is too much activity going on in my city. I have lived in the same city for twenty two years and have never seen anything like what i say and i am trying to peice together what was going on or happened and what i saw but i know 100% that it was a ufo sighting. I may not have photo or video evidence but i know what i saw was real and i would never lie about these things because it is very important to me im a fan not a player. THANK YOU AND MAY GOD BE WITH US.;45.492615730337;-122.415958426966
Bright purple light over a busy intersection.;2013-12-09 19:50:00;1 minute;Bright purple light over a busy intersection I was driving in a busy part of town when I saw a strange, bright purple light moving around the sky in an erratic manner.  People all around me were watching the sky.  It disappeared as fast as it appeared.;45.492615730337;-122.415958426966
Rocket-like UFO.;2014-08-19 16:00:00;10 minutes;Rocket-like UFO Early evening, I noticed a cloud formation shaped like a angled rip suddenly appear.  Within 20-30 seconds the top of the rip stretched until it was nearly double.   I couldn't stop staring and I'm glad I didn't because out of nowhere a rocket-shaped object without any visable propulsion system appeared beneath the cloud rip.   It was smooth and round on the head of the ship and elongated and tapered off at the bottom in a rounded point.  Strange wings were located on either side (which looked almost like upside-down versions of the ship itself) and were strangely detached but moving with the ship regardless.   The UFO was completely silent.   The ship speedily moved up and through the rip and then proceeded beyond it but seemed to be dissolving once it had cleared the cloud, and was gone in 2-3 seconds.   No more than half a minute later, 2 government jets passed nearly over the rip and proceeded on. 10 minutes later a strong wind started blowing (Not even a breeze beforehand) and blew for maybe 15 minutes before dying down completely.;45.492615730337;-122.415958426966
