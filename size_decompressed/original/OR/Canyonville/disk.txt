Disk-shaped craft spotted hovering in the sky;1996-11-09 02:00:00;5 minutes;Disk-shaped craft spotted hovering in the sky I was sleeping on top of my VW Bus in the woods near Canyonville, OR, when I woke up suddenly for no apparent reason. I looked up at the sky and became aware of a grey or silver craft hovering off to my left, approximately a half mile away. The craft was saucer shaped and had light panels on the bottom half of the saucer. The craft was spinning back and forth, and the only way I knew this was because I could see the light panels moving slowly back and forth. There was an inaudible hum or vibration in the air, like a subtle electric crackle. At first I thought in my mind, 'Oh wow, a UFO! So it's true...' but then I became very frightened. I jumped down off of the top of the bus and hurried inside to tell my friends, who were sleeping inside. I urged them to go outside and look, but they were too frightened to. I attempted to start the bus, but it wouldn't start, so I just kept trying over and over and let the starter attempt to pull us up a short hill. Finally, I just gave up and let the bus roll back down the hill, where we logded against a gate. I climbed into my sleeping bag and tried to calm myself (I was frantic throuhout the entire encounter!) In the morning, the bus started with no problems.;42.9321;-123.2728
