5 total strange reddish-orange lights dancing around above West-linn Tualatin area;2015-01-16 19:45:00;4 minutes;5 total strange reddish-orange lights dancing around above West-linn Tualatin area. Got out of my rig getting home tonight and looked across river and observed some strange reddish-orange lights dancing around above West-linn Tualatin area.  Started as 3, larger than stars.  Then 5 total appeared and continued to start stop and move in varying directions at varying velocities, until all but one disappeared.   I get planes going in this area every 10 mins or so and after 5 & 1/2 years of living here have NEVER EVER seen anything remotely similar.   The way they moved it had to have been multiple heavy duty RC helicoptors or ET?????   Of course by the time I ran inside and got my big lens on they were GONE!

Very bright yellow light high in the sky blinked out, came back on moved around and went out, 3 witnesses.;2017-10-24 21:08:00;4 minutes;Very bright yellow light high in the sky blinked out, came back on moved around and went out, 3 witnesses. 21:08, October 24th, 2017.   While in my backyard on October 24th, on a clear night, my wife and I observed a very bright yellow light in the N.W. sky.  The object was at approximately 45-50 degrees above the horizon and it was the brightest object in the night sky.  We both witnessed the object blink out.  The light then came back on within a few seconds and moved around the area, changing direction abruptly, yet moving in a linear fashion, before going out again. My wife went inside to retrieve her phone to record the object, and our 15 year old son joined us in the backyard at this time. The light came back on, but very dimly, moving out of the area to the northeast.  This time the movements were not abrupt, only linear and as it moved across the sky, it blinked.  It appeared that there may have been more objects following it. Two minutes and four seconds of video footage were taken during the encounter.;45.3894;-122.586
