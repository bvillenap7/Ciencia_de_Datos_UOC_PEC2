Three were in a triangle formation and one to the right was seperated from the others but with the group.  This was S.E. in the sky.  The were not moving they were seditary, seeming to just sit in the sky .... then they just disappeard. ????   This was an odd sighting.  And the fact that is was very low in the sky and flikered like red stars. ((NUFORC Note:  We assume an evening sighting.  We have changed the time above to reflect that fact.

Oregon City Sighting on 5/29/2010 - Approximatley 12 red-orange lights ascending in the east.;2010-05-29 22:00:00;5 minutes;Oregon City Sighting on 5/29/2010 - Approximatley 12 red-orange lights ascending in the east. May 29th, 2010. At approximately 10:30pm I was leaving my office in downtown Oregon City.  I was walking to the place I normally park under the bridge when I remembered it was Saturday and I had parked right in front of the office where the meters donâ€™t run on weekends.  As I was heading back, facing east, I noticed four (4) lights over the cliff where the big Oregon City elevator is - Which coincidentally is shaped like a UFO. They looked fairly high up, about as high as a plane would be coming in for landing at PDX from that distance - Ten thousand feet, (10,000) maybe? They ascended slowly upwards, appearing over the cliff. Although they were shaped like a triangle, it was apparent they were separate objects in a triangle formation. As they rose the formation began to break up and they criss-crossed each other.  They gradually faded the higher they climbed, eventually disappearing altogether. As one formation began to fade another rose up over the cliff a! nd as similar pattern was repeated. They moved slow and consistent, like balloons being released on a calm day. There was no mistaking them for balloons, however, it was very dark and they were lit up by their own light sources, not the sun or moon.  There appeared to be 12 total but I could be wrong.  I was frantically trying to call my workmate who was still up in the office to get him to come down and see. He made it down in time to see about 4 of the remaining lights before they faded. The lights were red-orange in color and they did not blink, flare up or change shape.  They were simply very bright as the rose over the cliff and faded the higher they climbed. We waited about 10 minutes to see if anymore appeared, but that was it.  End of show.  On a personal note, I am 34 and have never seen a UFO before, of any kind, except on film.   The behavior of these lights reminded me very much of some films I have seen of UFO clusters in the day time. Silver orbs floating arou! nd like balloons, eventually ascending and fading out.  Only t! his time they were at night and emitted a bright, red-orange light.;45.3636652173912;-122.619526086957
Bright white light and small red light in sky 8-28-2011 Oregon city oregon;2011-08-28 21:00:00;5 minutes;Bright white light and small red light in sky 8-28-2011 Oregon city oregon Last night around 9-9:05 pm my husband and i were on the front porch and saw a very bright white light flying in the sky. We knew it was not a plane because it was not flashing!  As we follow it we see a smaller red light fly to it and flash, then they both vanish. Now this was odd right?   Well, last month we saw the same thing from our porch along with our children and there friend, but this time the small red light went underneath the bright white one and made a flash, then the bright white one shot up in the sky and both vanished. Tonight we will be watching the skies around 845 pm to see if we can see it again.... I am now a believer.. I was before but this just really made our mouth drop! Anyone else that saw this please write about it.. Thank you Oh one more thing, down below these crafts were a jet liner and wow was it slower and smaller in comparison....;45.3636652173912;-122.619526086957
5 objects in the horizon sky rising.;2013-07-04 21:45:00;10 minutes;5 objects in the horizon sky rising. Me and my wife were looking over a hill in Oregon City looking West watching the July 4th fireworks. When we saw 4 bright objects in the horizon slowly rising.  With a 5th one joining it. They were very very far, so not possible fireworks, also they rose at a insane speed.  After a few minutes they all vanished.

What we witnessed has changed our entire way of thinking!;2016-11-19 20:40:00;10 minutes;What we witnessed has changed our entire way of thinking! First noticed what looked like a bright constellation of stars with ten to twelve objects.  We were instantly shocked at what we saw!!  It was extremely out of the ordinary.  We stopped and got out of our car to try and figure out what it was??  They were close enough that if it were jet planes we should of heard their engines, but we heard nothing.  They began accelerating and decelerating at speeds impossible for any known aircraft.  Our guess was going from speeds of 200mph to 2,500 mph back to 200 mph in one second.  Another smaller formation followed, this time one of the crafts did a quick circles around another at a speed again at a speed impossible for any known man made craft.  My wife, my son, and myself witnessed this event.  We are life long star watchers and air show attenders, this was unlike any shooting star, any jet, plane, helicopter, laser pointer, or night lights we have ever seen!!  It shook all of us up and none of us are shaken up easily. 5 minu! tes later my son went back outside again and saw another craft fly across the entire sky at approximately 3,000 mph!!  There is no doubt in any of our minds we witnessed something top secret or something from another planet!  No one could convince us otherwise!!;45.3636652173912;-122.619526086957
East to West dozens,one after a other, lined up and at times multiples side to side, grid pattern.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-12 05:33:00;at least 15 minutes;East to West dozens, one after a other, lined up and at times multiples side to side, grid pattern, lights moving through the air.  No sound.  During COVID19 when flights are grounded, except military.  I've got video showing part of this.;45.3636652173912;-122.619526086957
String of lights in the night sky but not exactly like star link.;2020-05-05 04:40:00;1:30;String of lights in the night sky but not exactly like star link I was walking my dog in the morning before heading to work. We crossed a busy street and I looked back behind me and noticed how big the moon looked. In my peripheral I noticed movement, changing focus I realize it's not just anything but a string of lights moving in unison. After many lights go by a formation of 4 lights in a diamond shape go by. Many more lights go by and what looks like the end, a light from below comes in fast and joins but cutting in fourth from the rear. The four back off creating what looks like equal distances. Then two more join at the back, not at the same time. These come from above and actually don't illuminate until nearly coming into the back of the line.  I tried to record with my cellphone but was unable to capture anything except audio of myself in disbelief. I actually flagged down a car who happened to be driving by but as soon as I mentioned UFOs they quickly accelerated away.;45.3636652173912;-122.619526086957
