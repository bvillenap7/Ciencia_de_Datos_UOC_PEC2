Eve;2017-10-22 21:00:00;5 minutes;There was a strange very slow blinking white light heading east at a snail's pace.  It was moving so slow that it looked stationary.  Every few seconds it would flash a very bright white light and it would stay lit for a second or two.   A few planes were moving near the object as well, so I know compared to the planes that I saw, this object was not a plane.  The planes that were also in the sky came into view and left like an ordinary plane, but during the timespan of those planes moving, this object had barely moved.  These planes were also very close in proximity to each other, and seemed to either pass over or pass by the object.  There were also no other planes that passed by once the object had disappeared.  It was too close to be a satellite and too high to be a drone.   I had taken a video on Snapchat and sent it to a friend but I unfortunately completely forgot to save the video.  About 5-10 minutes after first seeing it, it slowly faded away.;45.3636652173912;-122.619526086957
