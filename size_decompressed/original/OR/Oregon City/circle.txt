I was coming up over a small hill to approach the highway.  Saw a round solid edged greyish white light in sky.  The sky was grey and barley lit.  The white round light/object hovered for a short moment then moved quickly across sky at an arched angle, then disappeared.  The object was brighter in the middle of the circle and faded outward giving it the appearance of an aura or haze.  Just as I saw it the car in front of me had its break lights come on when traffic was not stopped or slowing they could have seen it too.;45.3636652173912;-122.619526086957
Bright ball of yellow light flying past window;2014-10-11 22:00:00;Seconds;Bright ball of yellow light flying past window I was sitting in my house on my phone being sleept on by my dad near a window, all of a sudden in the window I see the brightest ball of light I have ever seen, I knew it wasn't a plane for sure! It kept going past the trees in my neighbors yard, so I couldn't see it well, I was so excited and frightened I tried to get up, but failed since my dad was laying on me, once it leaved my sight I didn't see it again, on another note, this is the third ufo I have seen in this area the past year, and mounths.

Big, bright, circular object in sky, then disappears out of no where.;2020-11-03 19:05:00;3 minutes;Big, bright, circular object in sky, then disappears out of no where. I was driving through my neighborhood on November 3, 2020 at 7pm. I happened to see a bright light in the sky that just didn’t look normal, and it was large. I watched it while continuing to drive to see if maybe it was a plane, but it was in the same spot, so I knew it couldn’t have been a plane. I then parked and took a video. In my video you can see how big it was, even though it was far, from the comparison of the street light next to me. I zoomed in, it was a circular shape, reminded me of what ringworm looks like, a circular spot with a circle around it .  The brightness dimmed down in seconds, then it disappears out of no where, all captured on camera!;45.3636652173912;-122.619526086957

Instead I saw small orbs of light in a row, about 10 the first group flying by following each other, west to east. No apparent sound. A little while later another group, larger the the first, probably 20-30 flew over. All in a row, except for 3 that formed a triangle as the flew by. Not sure if satellites travel like this in a sort of beaded string and I thought meteors looked like they were falling and emitted a trail of light  These definitely looked like they were going somewhere and there was no light trail.I wanted to take a video but didn't think my phone camera could pick it up well. They were very small orbs of light in the sky.;45.3636652173912;-122.619526086957
