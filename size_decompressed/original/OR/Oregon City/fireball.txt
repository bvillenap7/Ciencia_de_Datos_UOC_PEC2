I was walking home from the store and was looking up at the sky.  Towards the hills of west linn coming towards Oregon City was a fire ball.   I proceeded to follow it, it left my sight so i climbed a few stairs up a road a few blocks from my house.  I saw thirteen redish orange fireballs.  Some were in formation and others were sporadic.  i ran home got my mother and my uncle to come outside to see the fireballs.   They proceeded out and saw what i saw.  They went at a slow but fast pace.  Seemed to speed up and slow down untill eventually they disappeared over my house.;45.3636652173912;-122.619526086957
