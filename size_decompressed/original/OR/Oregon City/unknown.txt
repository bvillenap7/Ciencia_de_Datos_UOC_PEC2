The objects made no sound.  They came in separately, following the same path. At a certain point the lights/objects vanished.  They could have been gliders but I don't think gliders can travel that fast (about the same speed or more than a jet).  It could also be that I simply didn't hear the engines.

My husband and I have spotted what appears to be a UFO. It is towards the East from our location and it at first glance looks like a star.  However, it flashes red and blue as well as white, and it moves irratically up , then down, then zigs and zags, yet it stays in the same vicinity of the sky.  We have been watching it for about 10-15 minutes so far.;45.3636652173912;-122.619526086957
