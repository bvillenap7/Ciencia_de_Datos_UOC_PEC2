Saw a craft that was moving in a direction that almost seemed like it was searching. It was flashing red, green, blue and white.   At times it seemed to be wobbling and was at first moving west.   This was about 11:30 pm and then it traveled south over Oregon City, OR.   About 10 minutes later it was headed north.    It made no sound but continued north until it was out of sight.;45.3636652173912;-122.619526086957

I thought it too big to be Mars. I hadn't  seen that light in at part of the sky before and it was bigger and higher than the tv or cell tower lights in the same area. It then disappeared. A few minutes later, I saw what I presume to be a saucer like craft, too dark to know for sure,  with lights, blinking and circling the sides of yellow, orange and another color, I can't remember whether blue or white. I listened for a sound to identify it as perhaps a small airplane, but didn't hear any noise. It flew from west to east. I have never seen flight paths near my home fly that direction. They normally fly from south to north. I watched until it flew behind a tree line.;45.3636652173912;-122.619526086957
