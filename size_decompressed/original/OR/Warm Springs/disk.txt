Craft with green beam over Warm Springs, Oregon;1973-07-22 09:00:00;30-60 secs.;Craft with green beam over Warm Springs, Oregon  500 Lights On Object0: Yes My mom, sister, brother and I were traveling to California.  We stopped at a roadside cafe in Warm Springs, Oregon for breakfast, about 9 am.  Shortly after seating, my brother  noticed a metallic, disk-shaped craft hovering approximately 200 yards away and about 75 to 100 yards above the ground.  A green beam of light shone down to the ground.  The sighting lasted for about 30 seconds to 1 minute.  I was watching the waitress as she went to alert other customers of the craft, when it vanished, along with everyones' memory of it except mine.   Later that day the craft was following us along highway 97, keeping itself partially hidden within the tree-line.   Our trip home, which religiously took 12 hours, took 13.   I am the only one in my family with any memories of these incidents.  Locals of the area say everything I saw was common back in the early seventies.
