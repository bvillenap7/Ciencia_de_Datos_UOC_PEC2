a shining metallic sphere moved swiftly  from  ground level to high altitudes;2005-06-19 18:00:00;1 minute;a shining metallic sphere moved swiftly  from  ground level to high altitudes There was a group of us sitting on the front porch during a thunder/lightening storm. Suddenly there was a dramatic wind shift . I looked for a funnel cloud thinking maybe a a small tornado. I thought it was a tornado data ball. Our house is elevated above a valley. From the lowest tree line we saw a very bright, metallic shining sphere go quickly into the sky . It reached jet altitude in such a quick time. We (3 ) saw the object in and out of the clouds moving swiftly. It was far away in no time then gone.;45.4145;-122.4616
Huge ball of light seen in eastern sky at 6 am Sept 25, 2007 east of Gresham, Oregon.;2007-09-25 06:00:00;1 + hours;Huge ball of light seen in eastern sky at 6 am Sept 25, 2007 east of Gresham, Oregon. Huge circle with arms of lights criss crossing bottom of object.  Surrounded by very small lights scattered like glitter all around the outer perimeter of object.  It was still dark outside and viewed through  a spotting scope all I could see were the lights.  I lined it up with some trees to see if it was moving across the sky and the object seemed to remain stationery for a long period of time.  When daylight started it got smaller and smaller  and finally faided out of sight.  I will check again at 6am in the morning to see if it may have been a satellite,  but it just seemed way too big and close for that.  A satellite travels and this was stationery.  It was east of Gresham/Damascus looking toward Mt Hood at 6am.;45.4145;-122.4616
