Two fast moving lights.;2020-06-17 23:00:00;1-2 minutes;Two fast moving lights There were two lights, one following the other perfectly like it was on the nose and tail of a plane. They were moving very fast and I watched them fly under a star but the star didn't blink like it would if there was a solid object connecting the two lights. They passed under another star, which also didn't blink and there also was no noise whatsoever.;45.4145;-122.4616
