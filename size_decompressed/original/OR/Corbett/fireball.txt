High altitude orange light;2021-08-11 23:30:00;1 minute or so;High altitude orange light Sighting occurred at the Vista House Observatory. A friend and I were watching the Perseids when I spotted what I thought at first was a meteor. It was a small orange light almost directly overhead that flashed orange.  I pointed it out to my friend who spotted it too. Instead of vanishing like normal meteor, it dimmed a little and kept moving across the sky. As we watched, it changed direction and seemed to occasionally move in small serpentine patterns in a manner that could not have been a satellite despite clearly being high altitude. We could also see large helicopters working on a forest fire in the region, but this was clearly much higher and only orange. It continued to move at a steady speed and switch directions before vanishing, though it may have been obscured by the smoke. I believe others may have seen this as well because we heard people close to us mention it too.  I’d like to stress that we saw a number of meteors, satellites, planes, etc. This couldn’t have been any of those. None of them could move the way this light did.;45.5221;-122.2417
