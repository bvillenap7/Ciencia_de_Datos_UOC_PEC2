Oval shaped object streaks across sky in Southern Oregon.;2008-11-18 17:35:00;3-4 seconds;Oval shaped object streaks across sky in Southern Oregon. I was watching the news, when I noticed a bright light streak from the east across outside the living room window towards the west. The object was bright enough to illuminate the tops of the Ponderosa's along my driveway. The object was seen through the trees. I was looking south out the window. Of course, I jumped up, ran to the window just to see it disappear behind a clump of trees and the mountains beyond my ranch. The object was oval shaped, and was first seen about 45 degrees off the horizon at 160 degrees on the compass in the south, and  it came in from the east and was heading west, at a 45 degree slope. Lost sighting at about 200 degrees compass heading. My ranch is 6 miles out of Sprague River North, and 18 miles out of Chiloquin, Or. south. The object emmitted a bright white light, no tail, and actually illuminated the treetops on my place. Duration of sighting about 3-4 seconds, this was enough time to make out shape. Time was about 5:35 pm. Size, if I was to hold a nickel coin at arms length, that was the size of this object. I ran to the end of my drive which is over 1000 feet long with binoculars, and no other obects or aircraft were seen. Clear skies, temp about 48 degrees. Estimated distance of object, undetermined at this time. The area we live is very remote and rural, horse and cattle ranches. Little or no commercial aircraft traffic flies in this area. Only an occasional helicopter during fire season. What this object was NOT. It was not a helicopter or private or commercial aircraft, as I did run out on my deck within a split second of seeing the object... no sound, or any collision lights red or green, or flashing lights. Could this had been space debris? Possibly. Could it have been the space station? No. Could it have been the Space Shuttle? No. Could it have been a meteor or fireball? NO, it had no tail, was a solid white very bright oval shaped object with a aura/halo around it. I have witnessed hundreds of not thousands of falling stars, meteors, watched comets, ect. It did not meet the characteristics of a meteor or falling star. Could it have been space junk? Yes, possibly. My background is the USAF, and I am familiar with many aircraft. It is undetermined at this time what this may have been. Summery Reason for posting this report is to see if there were any other witnesses from this Southern Oregon location. Someone may have had a better viewing of the object from a better location and can fill in some more details on this.;42.5463;-121.745
Object seen over Chiloquin, OR,  At 9:59am on 11 August 2018.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a high altitude balloon.  PD));2018-08-11 06:30:00;4-6 hours;Object seen over Chiloquin, Oregon   At 9:59 am on 11 August 2018 I received a call from a former police officer friend who lives a couple miles from me.  He stated he is looking at a strange white round object in the sky. He first spotted it at 6:30am. After reaching his home, I observed this object in the southern sky at about 179 degrees south at an 65 degrees off the horizon.  It was round, with which looked like 'hands of a clock at 6:10, and white in color.  The longer we looked at it and tried getting photos, more details came out. Several photos were taken and drawing in more detail.  There was a wind blowing from the north at about 10-15 mph, so the object was traveling from the southern direction to the north. (See attached photo & drawing)   By 1:30pm the object was at 347 degrees north from my resident at 85 degrees off horizon.  By 2:20pm it was out of my sight due to trees and a butte.   Altitude was hard to determine, as we are at 4300 feet, I would suspect the object was 10,000 or higher.  Size, hard to say without a point of reference. Both Kingsley Field in Klamath Falls and the weather center in  Medford, OR, have been called and message left. It has been noted that an object like this has been reported by numerous states recently. Observation balloon, weather instruments or something else?  At this time unknown.

3 glowing lights above my house for 5-6 minutes. Low to the ground.;2020-05-07 00:03:00;6 minutes;3 glowing lights above my house for 5-6 minutes. Low to the ground. When this happened, I was outside listening to music with friends.  There was a light breeze, and flashing lights above my house.  It went on for about 5-6 minutes.  3 lights appeared.  The lights were a green/white color.  It moved very slowly by my house.  And, it was probably around 500 feet in the air.  I figured it might be a plane or something.  But it would be too close to the ground.;42.5463;-121.745
