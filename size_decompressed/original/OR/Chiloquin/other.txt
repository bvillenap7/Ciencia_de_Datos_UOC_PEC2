Large boomerang shaped aircraft;2000-11-17 19:30:00;2 minutes;Large boomerang shaped aircraft 11/17/00 7:30 p.m., a large boomerang shaped aircraft with white lights.There was no sound.It moved very slowly in a northern direction.Five people(all family members) observed this craft for about two minutes after it was first sighted.Then it just disappeared. I don't see how something this big can fly at a snails pace and stay airborne. Although it was very dark outside, the lights illuminated the object well enough that you could see it's shape real well.I would not be at all surprised if this aircraft had a wing span of 300 feet or more.If my mom had not gone outside when she did, and draw this aircraft to our attention, it would have flown by and we wouldn't have even known it.;42.5463;-121.745

1st object looked like a Christmas tree red/green solid lights.  2nd object looked like a drone all white lights. ((anonymous));2020-03-01 21:30:00;3 hours;First object looked like a Christmas tree red/green solid lights.   Second object looked like a drone all white lights. Still to the naked eye, when looked at through the glass, they both danced around in the sky very fast.  They do not appear always at the same time.  We observed them from our back door over the wilderness area.;42.5463;-121.745
