3 flashing lights at exact distances crossed entire sky over a field and ducked behind a hill in less than 2 minutes.;2006-10-03 21:00:00;2 minutes;3 flashing lights at exact distances crossed entire sky over a field and ducked behind a hill in less than 2 minutes. From my porch i saw what at first i figured were 3 helicopters on the horizon at 9 pm. Looking out over a field in rural oregon every night i am well aware of the distance of landmarks  in sight and how fast and far planes, helicopters, and satellites etc. move in relation to them. these 3lights moved way too fast to be any of the aforementioned in my opinion and stayed at perfect equal distances from each other while moving rapidly across the sky at about 45 degrees from the horizon. it appeared to me they were holding together a massive disc shaped object. sort of like the way you can see the dark side of the moon just a bit because you know it is there.  by the tiome i grabbed my girlfriend and dad, about one minute had passed and the lights were just beginning to duck behind a hill. gone a few seconds later. by this point they had traveled one quarter of the horizon in less than two minutes . this takes jets more than ten several times a day. all while remaining perfectly equal distances in relation to each other. i am a 26 year old male who plays music and doesnt care one way or another about what is in the sky, except that this REALLY freaked me out. On a side note my dad expressed a in intense felling of DE JA VU.;45.3944;-121.1395
