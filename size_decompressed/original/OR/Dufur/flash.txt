Faint Yellow darting light zig zagged hight in night sky above Mt Hood Oregon;2005-08-05 22:30:00;15 minute;Faint Yellow darting light zig zagged hight in night sky above Mt Hood Oregon While up at a boy scout camp called camp baldwin on the East side of Mt Hood in Oregon, 3 boy scouts ages 13 ~ 14 and an audult leader went to go star gaze and watch shooting stars on a clear night(Aug 5th 2005). Around 22:30 for about about 15 minutes we all noticed a faint glowing pulsing yellow lights real high in the sky. We could not make out any shape.  The yellow light would zig zag and often show up in another part of the night sky. With all of us having star gaizing experience we knew that this was something that any of us have never seen.  Soon after loosing the yellow light in the sky we where told to go back to camp because we where out after curfu.  All of us went back in amazement relizing what we might have seen.  We had no camera at the time to take a pictural account. This acount has been recorded by the Adult leader and his son that was one of the boys.  What ever caused this all four of us just want to know.;45.3944;-121.1395
