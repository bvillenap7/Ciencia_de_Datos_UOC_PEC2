Light Object.;2016-09-19 22:00:00;7 minutes;Light Object A strong single bright white anomaly, out shining the surrounding porch and shop lights, hovered anywhere from 20 ft above the tree line, and what seemed to be around a quarter mile away.  From where it was placed the object hovered and slowly swayed from side to side not moving in any certain direction.  It didn't make a single noise.  The trees and small bushes it was near didn't seem to cast any sign of shadows.  Cars passed by and it seemed to almost look or follow their direction of travel.  Before leaving to travel towards the object, it faded to a deep red colored upside down L, then vanished to nothing.  The nights sky was quickly filled with the moons glow and strange cloud formations like layered disks appeared above where it once sat.  It didn't give off any emotions such as fear or excitement, but only the curiosity of what it actually was.;44.8313;-122.858
