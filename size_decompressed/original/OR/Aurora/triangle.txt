Three lights forming an equalateral triangle appeared and then disappeared while never changing position.;2013-05-04 21:10:00;2 minutes;Three lights forming an equalateral triangle appeared and then disappeared while never changing position. My wife and I were sitting out in the yard as darkness was approaching watching the stars appear.   Only a few stars were visible.  Then a light appeared off to the southeast that I first thought was a star, but it started to get brighter.   Then another light appeared off to its right, and it too began to get brighter.   Then a third light appeared above them forming a perfect equalateral triangle.  Then triangle never moved and appeared to be way up in the sky.  They brightened until they were the brightest lights in the sky. Then they began to dim. Then the last to appear slowly disappeared, followed by the next to last. Finally the first to appeared disappeared. Their positions in the sky never changed throughout the event.;45.2244;-122.8029
