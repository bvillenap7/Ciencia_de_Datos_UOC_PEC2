I looked to the left (southeast) above and between the trees and saw a very bright chrome looking object. It was in the shape of a square pillow. I could not tell how far away it was but I knew it wasn’t close by the way the trees were passing between it and I. I drove to the other side of the bridge and turned around to get a better look but the object was not there. I drove to the other side of the bridge and turned around again and when I came to the same location to look for the object again it was not there but there was another object farther away and at a higher elevation. I pulled over and looked through my binoculars and it appeared to be shaped similar to a dark cigar but with a distinct bulge towards one end. As I was trying to fine focus on the object it “disappeared” or faded out.  It did not move in any direction, or go behind clouds (there weren’t any), it just faded out. I immediately called my supervisor and he said I should call the FAA. I called and they said there was no one or dept. to report it to.  I called the Marion Co. Sheriff’s office and reported it and they gave me the number for the UFO Center.;45.2244;-122.8029
