Green object traveling west to east over Pilot Rock, Oregon;2018-04-30 22:00:00;1 minute;Green object traveling west to east over Pilot Rock, Oregon My Husband and I had went into the backyard and my Husband asked me to look at an object in the sky.  I saw a green sphere racing across the sky.  Looking south the object was moving right to left approximately 40 degrees from flat plane.  Object appeared about a ten percent the size of the full moon.  Bright green sphere traveled across the sky with no change in altitude.  We both followed it out of sight.;45.4227;-118.8483
Glowing red orb with smaller blue orb trailing behind traversing sky at high rate of speed.;2018-07-14 22:30:00;3 minutes;Glowing red orb with smaller blue orb trailing behind traversing sky at high rate of speed. At 22:30, 07.15.2018 I noticed an object traversing the sky in a Northerly direction.  A red glowing orb, with a smaller blue glowing orb trailing slightly behind.  The blue orb appeared to erratically circle around the path of the larger, red orb, but both were tracking nearly due north.  As they approached the path of a high-altitude airliner, the orbs slowed substantially, and veered around behind the path of the airplane, then continued on their original northerly direction.  These objects seemed to be flying at an altitude similar to high-flying commercial aircraft, but would have been MUCH larger than a large airplane, and were travelling much faster than the airplane.  Thursday night, 07/19/2018, two single red orbs were seen, 11 minutes apart, and observed by myself and another person.  Will report separately.;45.4227;-118.8483
Two separate red glowing orbs traversing the sky in a NNE direction, seen 11 minutes apart.;2018-07-19 22:20:00;15 minutes;Two separate red glowing orbs traversing the sky in a NNE direction, seen 11 minutes apart. At 22:20, 07.19.2018 a friend and I were standing in my front yard, when I looked up and saw a single red glowing orb traversing the sky in a NNE direction.  It appeared maybe to be at 2,000 to 3,000 feet up, moving at 100 to 150 mph.   We watched this go straight for several minutes until it faded out of view.  It changed direction slightly with a right/left turn, but continued on in its original direction.  As we were discussing what we had seen, another red orb appeared 11 minutes later.  This one was much higher (30,000 to 40,000 feet) and going much faster, twice as fast as a high-altitude airliner, and going in an ENE direction.  Again, we watched this until it faded from view over the horizon.  They didn't appear to HAVE lights on them...they WERE their own lights, glowing.;45.4227;-118.8483
