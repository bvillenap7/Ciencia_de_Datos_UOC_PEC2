Black hawk chasing ufo.;2012-12-13 20:00:00;.57 seconds;Black hawk chasing ufo. Hey last night around 9:00 I heard a black hawk flying over the town and it sounded very low compared to any of the other helicopters that have gone over my house.  So, I took a look outside to see what was happening and I see the helicopter with all of its lights off exept for a little red one on the tail flying really fast.  Then I look to the left a little to catch a glimpse of this glowing disk flying behind the peak of a house out of my view.   I keep looking and on the other side of the peak comes this glowing disk again.  It kind if went up and turned away from the helicopter and the heli went right after it.;45.7636;-122.8975

They came and went and almost looked like paper lanterns.  But they size and the way they moved was not anything we all have seen.;45.7636;-122.8975
