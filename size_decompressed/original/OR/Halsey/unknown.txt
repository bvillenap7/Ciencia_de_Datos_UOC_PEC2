Traveled between mach 4 and mach 10.  Could not see object.  Could only hear it. My six year old son and I were working in the back yard when I heard a loud whooshing sound from approx. 10 miles NW of my location.  At first I thought it might be the sound of a very large fire, such as a large farm structure burning.  Then I noticed the sound was moving from NW to NNW.  The sound then appeared to calm down for a portion of a minute.  Next the sound began to move rapidly in my direction and passed almost directly overhead.  Neither my son nor I could see anything, but I judged by the level of the noise that the source of the noise was either very low in altitude (500-1000 Ft.) or the object was very large and moving air like an object larger than several barns.  The sound continued in a SSW direction for about 30-40 seconds and then appeared to travel beyond audible range.  I estimate the distance traveled to be about 40 miles in under a minute.  On a map this would have been approx. 10 miles SSW of Corvallis, OR. to the vicinity of Springfield, OR..  For the entire duration of this event, I could not see any flashes of metal, nor could I see a con-trail or any other evidence of a common aircraft.  After I thought about this event for five or ten minutes, I decided to call air traffic control at the Eugene airport to see if they had noticed anything or had phone calls about an unusual event.  Their reply was negative. I am reporting this event 3 months after the actual occurance, so the exact date and time are approximations.  I would assume that the Eugene Airport should have record of my call.;44.3825;-123.123
