Fixed bright yellow light mass, emanating multiple sharp, pointed rays all around it.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus??  PD));2012-01-15 18:40:00;39 min;Fixed bright yellow light mass, emanating multiple sharp, pointed rays all around it We saw a fixed, very bright yellow starburst shaped object in the night sky above Astoria, Oregon, watched it from 6:30pm till past 7:09.  The sky is mostly cloudy with periods of clearing that allows viewing of the object.  When viewed through binoculars, the middle portion is a bright yellow lit mass with multiple pointed, sharp rays emanating from it all the way around.   The object doesn’t seem to move but appears to pulsate at times.  It doesn’t look like any star or planet I have ever seen.  It seems much closer than stars and planets.  I have not noticed the anomaly here before now, 1/15/12.  The object is very, very bright with a yellowish sort of light.

There was no sound, and as I continued to watch the lights started to slowly move from Northwest to Southeast. I had my camera with me and I tried to take a still photo, then switched to movie mode and managed to get about a 1 ½ to two minute film.  But as after about a minute the lights started to disappear one by one.  There was still no sound, and the light were still moving slowly from NW to SE.  After about 2 minutes all lights were gone and there was no evidence of them at all.   I continued to watch search the sky for about 30 seconds but they did not reappear.
