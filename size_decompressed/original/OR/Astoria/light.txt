Point source of light making abrupt changes in direction captured on video;2000-11-17 20:18:00;2 sec;Point source of light making abrupt changes in direction captured on video I recently set up a video system using an I3 piece image intesifier, Astrovid 2000 ccd camera and a Nikon 50mm f1.4 lens. This is mounted outside my home office window so that I can gaze at the night sky while working (I am a self-employed technical illustrator).  I was experimenting with recording the image to video tape.  I have captured many meteors and satellites and airplanes. At 20:18 I noticed what looked like a slow moving meteor.  As it travelled across the monitor it made two abrupt ~15 degree turns. I did catch it on the video tape, so if you would like a copy, I will send it. After thinking about it for a day, I was pretty sure that it must have been a slow meteor that changed course because of its shape, but the following night I had another siting.  I had not set up the video system since we had gone out for the evening,  When we got home I took the I-3 peice with the Nikon lens out just to do a little star gazing.  After about 10 minutes I noticed what seemed to be a fast satellite.  I tracked it as it went East to West.  About 45 degrees above the western horizon, it abruptly may a 90 degree turn to the North and vanished behind trees.(this happened at 21:20 pst). No recording of this object. I have decided to purchase a dedicated video tape recorde for this Image intesifier and hope to catch more interesting objects.;46.1558;-123.7978
Three separate lights dart across night sky on same trajectory , as if chasing after one and another, but they turned.;2009-03-29 22:00:00;30 seconds;Three separate lights dart across night sky on same trajectory , as if chasing after one and another, but they turned. I saw what looked like a dim, blue star moving across the sky. Then another appeared on the same path, further behind. The second object caught up with the first. Then the first object went into a tight, elliptical orbit, heading back the opposite direction as the second object followed. When these objects began their elliptical turn, a third object came towards them, quickly, from much further away. When the third object was close to the other two, it slowed down. The three objects were moving slow at this point, then faded out of view.  All three objects looked the same, like dim, blue stars.  I was standing at the edge of the, Columbia River, Washington, off State Route 401, facing east, looking directly across the river towards, Astoria, Oregon, when I saw this. As it was, I was observing the sky. My line of sight was 60 degrees.  The objects came from the north and were heading to my south before they turned. At first, I thought that I found a satellite, whereas it was moving quickly. My eyes followed it from my left-north to right-south. Then I scanned my eyes over to the left again and spotted another one moving much quicker on the same trajectory until it appeared to be behind the first one. I held my hand up, and the length of my thumb was the distance . Then they made the turn, one following the other heading north. Then I looked over to my complete left and saw the third moving the fastest...in about four seconds it was in my front view, slowed-down to almost a stop. At that point, it appeared to be near the other two, which were moving slowly, also.  From there, they faded away, as if their lights dimmed out.;46.1558;-123.7978

The space station was a brilliant white light and from our perspective the orb was slightly smaller, but very distinct and clear.
