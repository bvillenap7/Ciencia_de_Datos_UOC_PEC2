Shiny metallic silver disc (no lights) sighted near Astoria, OR;1995-09-17 11:00:00;2+ minutes;Shiny metallic silver disc (no lights) sighted near Astoria, OR Went to a concert with my girlfriend and saw a UFO on this date.  The date is accurate (still have ticket stub from concert), but the time is approximate.  We were traveling through the forest on HWY202 and above the treeline of the highway was a shiny silver disc maybe 400 feet up. It was broad daylight and sunny, no clouds.  It was hard to gauge the size of the disc, as there was nothing in the sky to which to compare it, but I'm guessing 20-30 feet across.  There were no identifiable lights.  It was bright metallic, truly blinding with the sun hitting it.  It made no noise.  It was impossible to mistake it for anything else. It did not move. It just hovered.  We passed underneath it and kept driving, as there was nowhere to pull off, but the roads were crowded so others saw it too.  It was the first and only time I've seen a UFO. I'll never forget it.  It was not a known terrestrial craft for sure.;46.1558;-123.7978
