A bright orange flaming orb appeared in the sky flying silently across the water  over the mouth of the Columbia river near Astoria Oregon.  Then stopped  and grew more intense in brightness and also appeared to grow in size for a few seconds before flashing a bright blue burst of what looked like electricity that lit up most  of the night sky.   Then it silently flew out of site but saw the same double  flash of blue light two or three more times as it would light up clouds on the horizon every 5 minutes or so.   Definitely not any possible aircraft lights or anything appearing man made whatsoever.;46.1558;-123.7978
