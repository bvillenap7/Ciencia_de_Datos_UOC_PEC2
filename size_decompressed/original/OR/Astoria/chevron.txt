I was standing on my balcony, looking west towards the horizon and I witnessed a very large red crescent/chevron shaped light sort of just hovering very low in the horizon.  It was bigger than a full moon would be.   I live on the Oregon coast, and have NEVER seen anything like this, I've seen some crazy stuff before, but this takes the cake. It loomed in the sky very low on the horizon for quite some time.  It gave of a steady florescent/neon glow unlike anything I've seen before.  After a while it looked like it started to 'bleed' light downwards, or drip, and eventually turned into a glowing red orb and disappeared.;46.1558;-123.7978
