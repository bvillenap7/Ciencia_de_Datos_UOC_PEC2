THERE'S SHIPS UP THERE.;2013-12-24 21:00:00;30 minutes;THERE'S SHIPS UP THERE While standing outside with my son on xmas eve (we just came out of church) it was 9 pm, we were in Athena, Oregon, which is mostly flat wheat land.  I was looking up in the night sky it was clear no clouds just totally clear night sky.  In the northern sky in the direction of Walla Walla, Washington, there was a big ship stationed in the sky.  It was fairly high in the sky and HUGE - it kind of looked like a cross - it had supper bright whitish lights it was really big.  Then to the right of it about 2 miles or so in the night sky was this HUGE cigar shaped ship just sitting in the sky - this one had green and red lights and the lights seemed to be kind of twinkling.  The night sky was really clean no clouds and these weren't air planes and they were huge!  I dont know why but i see many odd sightings in eastern regon night sky, I've also seen orange and red fire ball in the night sky but that was in the mts 30 miles west of portland going towards sea side.;45.8273;-118.5014
