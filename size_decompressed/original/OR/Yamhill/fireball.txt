A blue/green ball of light.;1998-10-04 04:45:00;4 seconds;A blue/green ball of light. I was delivering newspapers in rural Yamhill County, OR., driving in a northerly direction. The sky was partially cloudy - you could see stars here and there throughout 1/2 of the sky. My car was heading slightly uphill - the sighting took place in the top 1/2 of my windshield. At the 11:00 position, I first saw the clouds flash blue/green, then flash again just a second later a little lower and to the right. Then the ball appeared as it passed through the clouds, and disappeared at about the 4:00 position, I think behind some trees. The flashes were clearly the ball falling through the clouds. I think they were rather low in the sky. Absolutely no way this was a falling star. It was close.;45.3337;-123.2048
