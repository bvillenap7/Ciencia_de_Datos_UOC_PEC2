We (my mother and I) had pulled off to the side of the road to check on some farm equipment we had in a field. I noticed something out of the corner of my eye,turned my head, and saw a large bright green (think glowstick) ball of fire. It looked like it was maybe 10 miles away, and from where I was, looked about the size of a small car (think yugo). It took me about a second to register what I was seeing. I watched it for about 5 seconds. It went from a green ball of fire to your run of the mill orange, and then started to dim a bit. Then it was out of sight. It was falling at a slight arch. I've seen meteors falling before, and this was nothing like it. Also, there was a cop that had a car pulled over on the main road about 30 seconds before the fireball. After the event, I looked over toward the main road, saw his lights were no longer flashing, and then he was on the sideroad moving at a rather high rate of speed, Heading in the direction of where the ball fell. Im almost certain he saw it as well. Thats pretty much all the detail I have. Im 17 and a college student.;45.2;-122.9684
