We had heard a buzzing noise so a lot of neighbors came outside to see.  There was a round disc like hovering above a two story bldg with a dome shape on top.  It had lights that changed colors, blue to red to green, then flew away.  My mother called me and I ran outside to see if I could see it from my home a block away and with my video camera i captured something hovering above my mothers home.  As i was taping it came towards my home and changed shapes from a block away it looked small and changing colors.  When it came my way it got bigger and I could see the dome shape on top then got flat and wide.  In a matter of seconds it got smaller and disappeared into the sky.  In  pictures and video you can clearly see changing shapes.;44.9947;-123.0147
