Hovering Orange-ish light over Keizer, OR.;2013-11-05 19:15:00;4 minutes;Hovering Orange-ish light over Keizer, OR. I saw a bright orange-ish red-ish glow from my window towards the west.  I thought it was a plane on fire--went to investigate.   I saw a glowing cylinder about 400 ft in the air moving slowly from W to E.   I ran to get my binoculars--when I returned--it was gone.   It stopped mid air and just hovered. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));44.9947;-123.0147
