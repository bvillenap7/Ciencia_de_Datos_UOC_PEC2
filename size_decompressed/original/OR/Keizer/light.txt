Steady white light in sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus in the western sky, we suspect.  PD));2010-08-23 20:40:00;20 minutes;Steady white light in sky I had went outside to turn the water off when I noticed a rather large, bright white light off to the west.  It was about 5 degrees above the horizon and appeared to be stationary.  The light didn't blink or pulse, it looked like an aircraft landing light.  In size, it looked to be about the size of a match head when held at arms length. There were no other lights near this, ie. red or green navigation lights.  It was quiet enough that other aircraft could be heard and spotted in different locations. This light remained steady and appeared to be drifting very slowly to the west and slightly north, judging from its change in position. I watched this through binoculars for about 20 minutes, until it was obscured by trees at 2100. ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus in the western sky, we suspect.  PD));44.9947;-123.0147
Keizer Rapids park I was looking up when a really bright blue light was flying by and disappeared shortly.;2015-02-22 19:00:00;~5 seconds;Keizer Rapids park I was looking up when a really bright blue light was flying by and disappeared shortly. I was with my friend while we were building a fire.  When something caught my eye and I looked east there was an object that looked like a meteorite but was flying very low about the altitude drones fly.   Anyways this isn't the first time I've experienced UFO related things from this park.  The energy seemed a little dark around me before this happened as in first time it happened about 2 years ago me and friend heard a loud gong (like breaking the sound barrier) over the water and something pulsated through both our body's that felt like energy but were not able to see anything.  This time I saw something flying.   It was during sunset both my experiences took place. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Yellow to red ball/northeast sky/dropped balls.;2015-10-19 00:15:00;10 minutes;Yellow to red ball/northeast sky/dropped balls. Sunday October. 19 @ approx.00:15.  I looked out the front window of the house that faces east. I was looking to see if the clouds had clearer before going to bed.  I then noticed a round object in the north east sky.  The angle of the object was about 30 deg., it was small but really bright and glowing red to yellow.  At first I thought maybe a planet or satellite. I watched , and it just did not look right.  I then went outside to get a better look.  I was thinking maybe a helicopter or aircraft.  It was some distance away so I could hear no sound.  I continued to stand and watch for what now had been maybe 5-6 min. And all of a sudden a ball of light dropped from the original ball.  a few more seconds went by and 4 more balls dropped from the object.  These balls fell straight down.  About 10 seconds after the last dropped ball the original object faded out.;44.9947;-123.0147
