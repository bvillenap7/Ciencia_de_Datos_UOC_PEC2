Thought it was a plane initially but after observing it for 30 seconds I noticed there were no blinking lights like every other plane in the sky tonight.  Even as it traversed the sky no other blinking or colored lights were seen.  Just a steady orange glow that seemed to be traveling at a speed similar to what a plane would be moving.  My wife also observed the craft.  I walked in the house and came out with my phone.  Unfortunately I wasn’t recording like I thought I was.  When I hit stop is when I started recording.  All you can hear is my wife say “it disappeared”.  Which it literally did right in front of us.  I thought for a second it went behind a cloud but it was actually perfectly clear out and you could see all the stars.;44.9947;-123.0147
This was either a formation or a single craft with many lights on the outside. It was moving very slowly across the sky above my house.;2021-05-16 22:40:00;5 minutes or longer;This was either a formation or a single craft with many lights on the outside. It was moving very slowly across the sky above my house. I tried to film but nothing showed on my camera. Though on zooming in, it looked like a single craft with lights outside. Too grainy to see anything in photos. There was a soft humming noise and it moved towards the East and out of view.;44.9947;-123.0147
