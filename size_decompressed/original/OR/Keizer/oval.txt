Very large, oval shaped craft with two steady white lights for and aft. ((NUFORC Note:  Space Shuttle w/ ISS??  PD));2007-06-20 00:00:00;3 minutes;Very large, oval shaped craft with two steady white lights for and aft. I saw two stars that I didn't recognize as part of the night sky.  The two stars began to move in unison slowly across the southwestern part of the sky, heading from north to south.  As I looked at the two moving stars I could see the faint outline of an elongated oval.  It was really large so large that If I held up my hand, that would not be enough to hide the entire craft from my view.  The position of the lights were one fore and one aft.  The lights looked exactly like the other stars small, white and steady.  The lights were not blinking. ((NUFORC Note:  Space Shuttle w/ ISS??  PD));44.9947;-123.0147
