Pink orb sighted in Orgeon 4th of July 2017.;2017-07-04 20:00:00;10 minutes;Pink orb sighted in Orgeon 4th of July 2017 I observed a bright pink orb hovering in the sky.  I was looking west as the sun was slowly setting.  The sky was clear with a couple of clouds.  Fireworks were starting to go off in the 4th of July celebration. I thought it was a drone and didn't report it at the time. After viewing the orb for a few minutes I ran into the house to grab my wife to show her.  She watched it for a minute or two then went back in to the house.  About 1 to 2 minutes later I watched the orb take off at a very fast speed heading south.  The orb quickly darkened and grew dark as it started to fly south.  The orb did not change in altitude during the sighting and was perfectly still before heading south.  I would guess it was about 6 to 7 stories up, possibly higher as I could not tell how far away it was.  There was no audible sound that I could hear.;44.9947;-123.0147

At firsr glance it looked like the brighted star in the sky.  But when you watched it, it moved around so unnatural.  Almost like a buttefly in flight.  It would move rapidly up and down and jump short distances. while it appeared bright white you could also see red sometimes,  which me and her would confuse with blue and green,  it was almost a blinding white but other colors all at the same time. I had my fiance come out and he was absolutely stunned as well.  Im not one to just say I saw something,  I dont make shit up.  We all saw this,  its still out there and I got it on video;44.9947;-123.0147
