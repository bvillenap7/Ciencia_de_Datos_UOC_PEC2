I could see a large circular shape with spokes on the bottom of it. I was driving home Sunday evening at around 9:00 pm. My two granddaughters, 5 & 8 were with me. As I crossed the McCullough Bridge heading north on hwy 101, I happened to look to the North East and spotted a low flying object which seemed to be coming from the Haynes inlet area traveling in a South westerly direction. It was brightly lit with many flashing lights. I thought it must be a low flying plane of some sort or even a helicopter but it just didn't look quite right. It was flying slow and low over an area of homes just above the tree line. I than lost site of it as I continued North. I noticed it again as I passed Marine Lane on my right, which leads up to an area of nice homes. It was coming back into view as it passed over the tree covered hill heading for the dunes and ocean. As I was passing Spruce road (approx. 400 feet North of Marine Lane on the left) it emerged and passed over the highway directly over my car. A strange shape, maybe wedge shaped? It was dark but I could see a large circular shape with spokes on the bottom of it. It wasn't a helicopter for sure, and if it was a plane, it was not like any I have seen. It was flying very slow and it was quiet, no sound. I am reluctant to talk about this because I would think many people would have seen it - it was so visible, but there have been no reports of anything strange. It was very near the North Bend Airport, yet it was not in any flight path to land, it was headed toward the ocean. If anyone else saw this, please post it. It would be comforting to know if someone else saw this.;43.4323;-124.2131
