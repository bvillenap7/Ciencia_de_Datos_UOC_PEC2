On 7-13-2014 at around 9:30 pm, I was driving north on highway 101 on the Oregon coast, just outside of North Bend, almost to the area known as Houser.    I saw a small but very bright orange sphere shaped light about a half mile north of my location.  I kept my eye on it trying to figure out exactly what it was.  As I approached it I realized that it was following HWY 101 about 200 feet above moving south.  I passed another car that looked to be recording the light.  I found the first safe place to pull over and managed to get a few seconds of video with my phone as it passed over me then disappeared in the fog.;43.4323;-124.2131
