We sat there and watched it for about 30 minutes and it appeared it was going up and down in elevation. All of a sudden the light start to appear to go further and further away. The light got dimmer then, almost straight out of a movie, the light appeared to Shrink and elongate, and shoot off into space leaving a sort of dust cloud as it took off, we sat there in absolute disbelief of what we just saw. We were both trembling and had no idea what to do or how to react.  We sat there for quite sometime and kept looking out the window, about 40 min to an hr past and we decided to get back in bed. As we were climbing into bed she looks over and sees the orange light returning. I got a terrible feeling in my stomach and tell her to stay in bed and not to go back to the window. We sit there and watch it again for about 20 minutes or so. She decided to get up and go to the window and record the light. We try to zoom in on it but the quality isn’t the best. She records it for about 15-20 minutes but it stay put and does nothing.  It’s now almost 6am. And we decide to go to bed. When we wake up we decide to look at the video she recorded and what we saw was beyond belief. The orange light appears to exploded and turn into a rubix  cube type figure. It appears to have point folding in on eachother. We didn’t know we captured it on video until we rewatched the footage.;44.5484;-123.1158
