Huge fireball seen from NE Oregon town of Umatilla.;2008-08-02 00:12:00;10 seconds;Huge fireball seen from NE Oregon town of Umatilla. I FIRST NOTICED OBJECT AT 90 DEGREES, SSW OF MCNARY AREA IN UMATILLA OR. FIREBALL APPEARED AS BIG AS A SOFTBALL HELD AT ARMS DISTANCE. FIREBALL WAS BRIGHT ENOUGH TO LIGHT UP SKY, TREES, AND HILLS FOR AS FAR AS I COULD SEE.  I WAS FACING WEST AT THE TIME AND OVERLOOKING PART OF THE COLUMBIA RIVER GORGE ONE MILE AWAY AND SLIGHTLY NW OF MY POSITION. THE GORGE WAS LIT UP BREIFLY DURING THE EVENT.  COLOR OF LIGHT WENT FROM RED TO YELLOW TO WHITE.  SHADOWS OF TREES, CARS, AND HOUSES NEAR MY 2ND STORY WINDOW, WERE PRONOUNCED AS IF CAUSED BY A SEARCHLIGHT.  I CANNOT ESTIMATE THE DISTANCE AWAY. OBJECT FELL STRAIGHT DOWN, FROM 90 DEGREES TO 50 DEGREES SSW, FOR ABOUT 10 SECONDS. AT THE END OF THE SIGHTING OBJECT EXPLODED INTO SHORT, WHITE STREAMERS WHICH LASTED NO LONGER THAN A SECOND. MY 53 YEAR OLD EYES HELD THE IMAGE, AFTER IT BURNED OUT, FOR ABOUT A MINUTE.;45.8998;-119.3553
