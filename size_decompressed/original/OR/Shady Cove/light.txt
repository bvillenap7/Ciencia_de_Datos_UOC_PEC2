Eight moving red/white lights--flying in random order from west to east over Shady Cove, OR the evening of November 16, 2016.;2016-11-16 17:30:00;5 minutes;Eight moving red/white lights--flying in random order from west to east over Shady Cove, OR the evening of November 16, 2016. I arrived home from work--17:30 and noticed several moving lights in the sky.  There were eight lights moving west to east.   I watched for a minute or so, trying to decide what I was seeing, and realized I wasn't hearing any sound like I would from an airplane.  I ran to the front door and called for my husband to come and see the lights--he stood on the from porch steps and we both watched the lights move for about 5 minutes.   The lights-red with a smaller white light--moving from the west--flew in a random order (seemingly).  The lights all moved up and through the same spot in a cloud.  We watched waiting for them to come out the other side of the cloud--but nothing.   The last of the lights moved faster from the west than the other lights and disappeared through the same hole in the cloud.;42.6132;-122.8139
