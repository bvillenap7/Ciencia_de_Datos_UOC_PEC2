Red light bouncing in the  sky.;2010-03-21 03:00:00;about 2 mins;Red light bouncing in the  sky. I woke up about 3 am to a noise, and then could not go back to sleep so I went out to the back deck to smoke and as I went out I picked up my camera to look at my days pictures. It was kinda over cast so no stars were visible.  I heard that noise again, and looked up and I saw it.  So having my camera I put it on video and got it.  It was coming towards me so I got a little scared and went back inside, and continued to watch from the sliding glass door.  It was all over the place....   Then it shot straight up and was gone.   I have seen many in my life as well. I had one years ago on VHS that I caught and sent the tape to you.  I never got my tape back or anything so I hope this helps.  Also, there is a sound of what seems to be static I did not hear it, but on the video you can hear it.  The ufo was bright red.  I could see it clearly.  Like I said I have the video. tell m where to send it. ((NUFORC Note:  We have corrected the time above, to reflect 3:00 a.m..  PD));44.8349;-124.0612
