I was standing outside on the porch  to look around and check the weather, and looked up for unknown reason(s).  I saw a bright oval shaped object traveling in an south to north declination at approximately 45 deg as I was roughly facing north.  It was a silvery bright color almost like an LED light.  I immediately grabbed my binoculars and got the object in sight.  I zoomed in and could not make out any shape other than oval. It had be traveling at relatively high speed from my vantage point and appeared larger than a satellite.  When I initially saw it with my naked eye, I  believe that I made the best sighting at that time.  The object had no red, green, or any other blinking lights.  It made no sound.;45.2929;-122.7746
