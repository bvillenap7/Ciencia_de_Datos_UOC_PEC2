Bright lights from miles away to within 150 yds and 300 ft in the air.;1995-09-16 01:00:00;3 minutes;Bright lights from miles away to within 150 yds and 300 ft in the air. Driving with wife on I-5 N bound at 1 AM.  Just leaving Woodburn area and noticed bright lights over NW and SW Portland coming my way.  Told the wife that was a strange pattern for an aircraft.  The lights on what looked like landing lights on a large aircraft continued toward us.  As I was approaching Wilsonville area it came staight at me then went out of sight within a 150 yds to the East of the freeway.  There was no explosion or anything.  if it was a helicopter or plane why would the lights go out while still 300 ft in the air. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));45.2929;-122.7746
Orange glow of light that faded away moved horizontal, glow diminished but still visible.;1999-09-01 21:30:00;1 min;Orange glow of light that faded away moved horizontal, glow diminished but still visible. Orange glow of light, first thought it to be an aircraft, but no red/green/white lights.  Remained at slightly above tree top level and then continued horizontally fading away but still moving horizontal until hidden by trees.  There were aircraft in the area but the glow seemed to disappear(outline still barely visible) when a jet went overhead;45.2929;-122.7746
Might be a UFO.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible twinkling star??  PD));2007-01-22 21:00:00;still happening as I writ;Might be a UFO I was setting an item on my deck in the back of my apartment and I noticed a bright light blinking light coming from the sky.  So I turn my head expecting to see a plane moving across the night sky but instead I see an almost motionless blinking light.  I thought well maybe it is a satellite but then I noticed a satellite to the left of the light that was pretty faint in comparison. I called my Roommate over to look at it to double check to make sure I wasn't crazy and I was seeing what I was seeing.  She came to the deck and I didn't even need to point the object out.  She noticed it right away.  She saw it move in a little circle but it was so far up in the atmosphere it was barely noticeable. The colors it is Blinking is red, blue, green and white.  It is too far up to make out an actual shape.  And who knows we could be wrong and it could just be a really low satellite.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible twinkling star??  PD));45.2929;-122.7746
