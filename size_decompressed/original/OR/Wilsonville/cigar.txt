UFO Sighting on 9/1/13... On  this date at approx. 10:15pm I witnessed a UFO directly overhead our house in Wilsonville, Or. (unknown latitude & longitude), flying from south to north in an approx. 45 degree arc in a matter of 10 seconds. It was not brightly lit, it did not appear to have a direct light source but more of a reflected light, a muted light of a brownish color. There were no flashing lights as would be seen on an airplane. The shape did not change as it would with a bird flapping its wings - and normally birds don't fly at night. About 10 seconds after it passed out of view, it came back into view flying again directly overhead, but this time flying north to south, and this time my wife saw it, so she was my witness, and I, hers. There was no sound, but the shape of it was elongated, yet flying long side forward. I would just like to know if anyone else in the area witnessed this, and of course what it was, if not an alien craft.;45.2929;-122.7746
