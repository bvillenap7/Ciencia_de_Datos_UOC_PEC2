The lights were perfectly linear and moving North-Northeast across the sky.  The formation was tiled roughly ten degrees to the right but the trajectory the object took was roughly thirty degrees (essentially a tilted line flying at an odd angle).  The sky was clear, and no sound was emitted.  The lights never broke formation and slowly worked their way across the sky, finally fading away.  Although I would like to think this was a plane, there were no visible wing lights, blinking lights or chem trails. ((NUFORC Note:  Space Link satellites, launched Thursday evening, May 23rd.
