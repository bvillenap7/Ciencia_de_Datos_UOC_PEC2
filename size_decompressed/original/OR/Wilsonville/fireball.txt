It appeared as if it went down into the trees. Personal information of observer:  mother of 2, 50 years old, professional health care provider.  First time I've ever seen anything like this.  I was totally incredulous.  It was the greenest green I have ever seen, and very beautiful. Size as I saw it was like a softball, or a little bigger.  .;45.2929;-122.7746
