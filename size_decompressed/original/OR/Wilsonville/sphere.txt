Sighting 6-19-2014  from 6:17 to 6:22  PM PST pm Wilsonville, Oregon,  small-appearing, spherical white, pearl-like object WITHIN OUR ATMOSPHERE,  very high up, I am gut-guessing  that it was at over 2o,ooo feet but difficult to say without anything to compare it to.  It was at most 5% to 10% the size of a full moon when the moon is at it highest point in the sky. Fixed, not moving at all, appeared to be NAILED TO THE SKY, impervious to any wind whatsoever.  Had it moved at all during the observation we would have assumed that it was a child's balloon. Difficult to spot in the first place,  my wife only saw it because we were on our backs sky-gazing, even when she pointed to it, it took me a good ten seconds to lock onto it myself.  Binoculars failed to reveal any detail.  No camera that we have access to would have been worthy of capturing it. While I was fumbling for a better pair of binocs, object virtually winked out of existence while my wife had her eyes locked onto it. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be a very capable, and sober-minded, individual.  We suspect that he is a very good witness.
