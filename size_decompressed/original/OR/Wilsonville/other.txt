There was an air balloon flying near Wilsonville, Oregon, on October 24, 2015, at around 5 pm, I was looking at it and the surrounding sky, when I was looking at the southern sky area I noticed a shiny object near a cloud that moved odd, it was still for a little while and then turned in a circular manner changing direction towards the north (Portland, OR), it moved for a little while going north, the object stopped and hovered near another cloud, it stay there for another while, then kept moving again towards the north until it was no longer visible.   The object was WAY up in the sky, it looked shinny, possibly metallic, and had a roundish shape, it was way up there so couldn't really make out any specific details.  I had a camcorder with me and was so excited I was watching a UFO, I thought I was recording the object, but unfortunately forgot to push the record button, only got a tiny segment and some frames, it was very difficult to see on the camcorder anyways.  A friend was walking with me, I told him to look, he got to see the object too, not just me. I'm reporting it just in case someone else might have seen the same object in the sky around the same time.;45.2929;-122.7746
