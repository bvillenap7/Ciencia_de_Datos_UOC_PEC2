I followed it because it was such a bright object.  While I watched, the fireball grew bigger, then faded to a long flat object with what looked like wings projecting from the top and bottom, like it was a very long tube like airplane on its side.  As I was watching it move from west to east, I spotted what looked like a smaller large object move in the same direction, parallel with the large object, but lower in the sky, making it seem to be a great distance away.  The first large object seemed to grow larger in size as it moved seemingly farther away.  the second object continued to track the first.  As I was standing in the middle of the street, there were trees in the area and I lost the object behind trees that were too numerous for me to track on.  By the time I got to an area where I could see more sky, all objects were gone.  This was no more than about 1/2 block and took place over about 30 seconds I believe.  I was entranced, unable to believe what I saw, I almost pooh-poohed it but continued to watch and could not believe what I saw.  I finally realized that it could not be a meteor as it was moving too slow for that.  I am an elementary teacher in the coos bay school system and have been interested in these type of sightings for many years, but this is the first one I have  personally seen.  I was amazed and absolutely thrilled to have seen something out of the ordinary.  I sent an e-mail to KVAL-tv that night and never got a reply but did hear something on the 11:00 news that stated that it was a russian space object.  I forgot about it until I heard a broadcast on KWRO-am radio at approximately 10:15 on September 16th.;43.2153629692836;-124.198437372014

I would think it was just a shooting star, but it was much brighter and much larger and the green tip threw me off.  It also was not a clear night and very dense and cloudy.  There were no other stars present.;43.2153629692836;-124.198437372014
