Her attention was drawn to an object to the east that was moving from south to north.  She looked at it with binoculars, and the object appeared to be round, and it was tan and very bright, and it was moving fast. (??)  In her words, it looked like a flaming object.  The object passed out of sight over the mountains to the north.   ((Note:  There were discrepancies in the report.  At first, the observer reported that the object was large, then she said it was visible when she looked at it with binoculars.))
