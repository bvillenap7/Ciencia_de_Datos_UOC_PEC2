Black triangle cruised above treetops right over my daughter and me!;2010-11-02 19:45:00;5 secs;Black triangle cruised above treetops right over my daughter and I! My daughter and I had found a place in town to observe the night sky stars at twilight.  This spot overlooks the ocean.  It was about 7:30 pm and very clear out.  We noticed a big flash in the sky that then glowed red traveling south to north.  We were excited to see this and when we didn't observe anything else we went home.   At home we took out the garbage and once again looked at the stars hoping to see something.  After 10 minutes I saw a black triangle with 7 dimmed orange lights in a chevron order.  I observed it traveling just above the trees right over us from north to south three stories up.  It cruised by silently in about 5 seconds.   As soon as I saw it I grabbed my daughter and yelled, Look! Do you see it! Do you see it!  She saw it and was speechless until it was gone from sight.  We watched as it headed out toward the ocean,  We still can't believe it!  I can't believe it was so close and seemed very nonthreatening to us.   My daughter feels that the flash we originally saw was the black triangle that it 'felt' our excitment and came to see us? Its a theory of hers.  We are waiting for another clear night to see if it will 'visit' us again!;43.2153629692836;-124.198437372014
