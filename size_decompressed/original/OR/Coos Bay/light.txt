I saw a steady ball of light with no sound  about 20,000 feet fly by in a northesterly direction from coos bay;2011-08-16 17:28:00;7 minutes;I saw a steady ball of light with no sound  about 20,000 feet fly by in a northesterly direction from coos bay I took the dog out to the backyard and noticed movement to the north at about 75 degrees moving in a north eastern direction.  It was a white ball of light about 20,000 feet elevation moving about the cruising speed of the coast guard helicopters.  My best guess of diameter was about 100 feet. it appeared sheperical.  There was absolutely no noise. i'm in the flight paths of our local airport and helicopters and i can tell you it was not a normal flight path.  I know what i saw because i grew up learning aeronautical information from my uncle who was an engineer for boeing for 40+ years and have always been an aircraft enthusiast. i watched it untill it was out of site. We live on the highest central hill in the area.  The brilliance of the light did not flicker or change in any way, it was steady untill out of my site.  there was trail. no color changes. no landing. no sound. no aura. no haze.  i didn't grab the camera because i didn't know how long it would last! .;43.2153629692836;-124.198437372014
Star like object moving sporadically in northwest sky night after night.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus?  PD));2013-11-03 19:00:00;Ongoing (Possibly);Star like object moving sporadically in northwest sky night after night. 11/2/13 and 11/3/13 (11/4/14 100% cloud coverage tonight for us so unable to tell if still ongoing.)  Me and my fiancee witnessed a bright object in the sky moving.  It is (was) located in the northwestern sky and at first glance looks just like a star.  Staring at it we noticed it moving slightly to the west or southwest direction, then all of a sudden it accelerated drastically and pulled a very tight 180 degree turn.   Further observation of this UFO it continued to move left to right and in circles while slowing down and speeding up randomly.  It would also dim and brighten back up at times during all this.  That was 11/2/2013 and was visible once dark.   The next night (11/3/2013) we observe the same UFO doing the same sporadic behaviors in the same area of the sky.  I'd bet its still there but can't confirm due do 100% cloud coverage tonight (11/4/2013) in my area. At first thought it was probably just a plane til it pulled that tight 180 I knew then that it wasn't. Also know it isn't a comet or such, because if so would not act in such a fashion.  Started to think it could possibly been a satellite but I was not sure.  So I have researched a lot about our satellite's such as how they work and move/orbit exactly.  After my satellite research I'm convinced this UFO is not a satellite. So what is this star looking object in the northwest sky moving sporadically night after night exactly?;43.2153629692836;-124.198437372014
Bright orange point of light travelling very fast across sky .;2014-07-04 22:05:00;5-10 seconds;Bright orange point of light travelling very fast across sky . A friend and I witnessed an orange point of light traverse the sky in approximately 5-10 seconds.  Object was similar in apparent brightness, size and color to the planet Mars. Object travelled in a straight line from the west southwest to the east northeast.  Object did not appear to change color, speed, brightness, size or direction.  No sound was heard and no train, trail or tail was visible behind the object like a bright meteor or bolide would normally leave. Sky conditions were mostly fair.;43.2153629692836;-124.198437372014
Yellowish Bright light coming off Pacific ocean  in a Northeast direction , not a aircraft taking off or landing at local airport.;2015-02-14 18:47:00;4 minutes;Yellowish Bright light coming off Pacific ocean  in a Northeast direction , not a aircraft taking off or landing at local airport. Looking north twoards local airport: North Bend,Or. (OTH) I often check the sky for sattlelite activity coming onto USA soil from western pacific area.  This object was lower than usual sattelite views.  It was quite Yellowish Bright .  I thought maybe it was the International Space Station,  But the local medias did not forewarn?  I notified the Seattle office of the FAA /unusual sightings.;43.2153629692836;-124.198437372014
6 lights in two groups moving ENE.;2020-09-16 05:30:00;2 minutes;6 lights in two groups moving ENE. I stepped out on to the deck at 5:30 AM looking north. I immediately noticed a light moving ENE. My first thought was a satellite. As I watched it for about 10 seconds, I noticed a dimmer light just ahead also moving in the same direction. They moved into the haze from the wildfires to the east and disappeared. I was just about to turn around and go back inside when I saw to the west 4 more lights moving in the same direction. They were fairly close together, though not in a straight line. They were visible long enough for me to retrieve my binoculars from the bookshelf just inside the house, and train it on one of the objects. It was bright white with no colors showing. I watched them for about 45 seconds until they faded away.;43.2153629692836;-124.198437372014
