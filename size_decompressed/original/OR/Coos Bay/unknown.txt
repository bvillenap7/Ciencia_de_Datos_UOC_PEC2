They gave the impression of being attached.   They moved almost due north but slightly east.  For a moment, the light in front flared with color change to about -1 Magnitude brightness and the trailing object seemed to dim at the same time.   Thought this might have been the ISS with trailing craft, but ISS was over Russia heading East. We are expecting thunderstorm activity in our area for the next couple days so was anticipating some movement by our 'visitor friends'.   A 'typical' movement for them is south along the coast then inland south of me, until they reach Interstate 5.  So this is a bit strange, but so is the weather right now. Total sighting lasted about 2 minutes until lost in the glare of town to my north.;43.2153629692836;-124.198437372014
