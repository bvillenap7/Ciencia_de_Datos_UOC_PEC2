I walked away from the fire to observe the stars, and saw two red objects over the ocean at about 30° off the horizon, quite far offshore.  They were stationary. They began pulsing and fading after about 30 seconds, then disappeared.  I waited about 5 minutes and saw another one by itself this time. I called my son over, and we both watched it do exactly the same thing as the first two.  I got a photo of the second occurrence, although it just looks like a small red dot on a black background. If these are planes as someone else in this forum suggested he saw by Astoria, they behaved like no planes I’ve ever seen, and if I was American I’d want to know what’s going on up there.  Actually,  I still want to know what’s going on up there.  I can email you the photo if you like.;45.7206;-123.9057

Bright white light moved frimWSW (fm ocean) toward NNE, very rapidly.  Changed direction at an extreme angle, accelerating  vertically to pinpoint in a flash.  The object was too bright and too large for any known device-and too fast to be a conventional aircraft.  Our dog Louis also watched and growled at the light..;45.7206;-123.9057
