Boring, Oregon sighted fireball heading south;2008-02-19 03:24:00;3 seconds;Boring, Oregon sighted fireball heading south I live on the top of a hill and obseved a fire ball heading south at an aproximate angle of 25 degreese down. From my vantage point I was looking due East at an angle of about 45 degreese up. Since it was very dark I could not tell distance. Although, it was large enough that I could actually see that the object appeared to be a round fire ball. And I could see the actual flames coming off of it along with a rather short fire tail. We have witnessed streaks across the night sky before but this was totally different. It was either very large or very close. If I hold a dime out in front of me at arms length that was the aproximate size.;45.4254;-122.3811
