Disk over John Day, Oregon.  And giant red flames 3 in all taking off by Lakeview, Oregon.;2013-11-10 07:40:00;2 minutes;Disk over John Day Oregon.  And giant red flames 3 in all taking off by Lakeview oregon My husband and I have traveled through john day many times.  This day it was so beautiful and sunny, I was taking pictures of the mountains and noticed this round object zipping through the ski I started snapping pictures as quick as I could and did get this one in a photo.  And while I was taking them I was yelling at my husband that I think I am looking at a UFO.  He did get a small glance.  There was another time when we were traveling from Lakeview oregon there by the salt lakes  Same thing I was taking photos.  It was just starting to get dusk.  On one part of the flat areas of the hills I saw this giant round circle red flames it looked like it was a jet taking off an air strip except no air strip and there were three of them one after the other and it shot up into the ski and disappeared.  This was a few days after the disk in john day.  I didn't get a picture I would take a lie detection test on both.  I was amased and could not believe it And still think of it quite often;44.4187;-118.9572
