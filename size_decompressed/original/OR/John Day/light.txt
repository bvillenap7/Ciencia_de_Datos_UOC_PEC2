On September 18, 1999, from the Clyde Holliday camp ground located seven miles west of John Day, Oregon, I observed several unknown lights in the sky to the east (drawing enclosed)between the times of 20:05 and 20:25. The lights appeared to be very high and moving at high speed when seen. One, however proved to be stationary until it pursued another which passed nearby. Another made a sharp thirty degree turn, with no turning radius, from its original linear path. All the lights were white in color and between magnitude 3 and 4 in brightness. The first one noticed appeared to be a low-altitude satellite since it moved somewhat faster than most satellites vith variable brightness from tumbling in its transit. I have observed several suspected UFOs over the years but have always been able to determine their cause. Those mentioned here, though I cannot explain. They were most certainly unknown as far as I am concerned.;44.4187;-118.9572
