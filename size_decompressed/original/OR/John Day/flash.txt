Eastern sky large flash star missing Super Nova?;2011-07-04 23:45:00;2 minutes;Eastern sky large flash star missing Super Nova? Camping,Star gazing our elevation 5180ft.  Eastern sky 1/2 way up off horizon.2 stars close together,1dim the other about 3times brighter. The dimmer one started flickering in brightness,which caught our eye.  Then it started to glow(like a light on the verge of burning out), Just as  bright as its neighbor,and then, A flash of light,(like an old flashbulb), Which spilled out into the sky. Temporarily drowning out, or blocking the light from its brighter neighbor.  Followed by 2 waves (Orange in color),of 1/2 Arcs (like rippling water, but not complete circles)on opposite sides of where the star was,  Which was gone from the night sky. There was no sound and did not cast a shadow.  The Milky Way was passing in front of these stars.  I know the date.  But, this was no firework.          Super Nova?  I thought this would be on the news or the Web.  But haven't found anything.;44.4187;-118.9572
