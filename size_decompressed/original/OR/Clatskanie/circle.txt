I was leaving work at about 130am and rigth after I pulled out of our parking lot, I seen a green ball come from the top of a rather tall hill, and it dissapeared about 50-100 feet over a large grassy field, on the outskirts of town. My only belief that it is a UFO, is that is was traveling rather slowly, yet still fast, but I could notice a lack in speed. A week later, I had found out that a friend of mine was staying at his grandparents, and while on the couch sleeping, he suddenly woke up due to a bright green light in the sky. When I had seen the green ball, it wasn't that bright to me.;46.0673;-123.206
