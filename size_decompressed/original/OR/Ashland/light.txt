A light drifted from west to east, roughly following the Rogue Valley corridor.;1999-07-24 22:20:00;1-2 minutes;A light drifted from west to east, roughly following the Rogue Valley corridor. I was standing in front of my home, and saw a light drifting from west to east, roughly following the Rogue Valley corridor. I was facing north, toward Grizzly Peak. There was no sound, no flashing lights as on aircraft wings, the path was not exactly straight, but somewhat wobbly it was slow, not fast like a meteor and at the east end of the valley it disappeared as if it had gone behind a cloud, however, it didn't reappear. At some points in its trajectory it looked blurry. It was too low to be a satellite it was a constant white light as it drifted from the left of my visual field to my right, as a planet's light is constant because it is reflected light. I am an acupuncturist with a masters of science in oriental medicine. My vision is 20/10, I do not have night blindness or light sensitivity, and I have been living in this location since 4/97. I have never seen a UFO before, however, I have seen satellites, meteorites, and of course aircraft at night.;42.1889000000001;-122.6908
miltiple UFO sighting over Ashland Oregon 8/28/02;2002-08-28 21:30:00;:45;miltiple UFO sighting over Ashland Oregon 8/28/02 Looking out from our house above Southern Oregon University we saw to the left of Grizzley peak about 20 miles or so a bright stationary light. I took a look with a telescope thinking a star, but all I could see was a yellow ball with a red tinge. The shape had a kaliedescope effect on the telescope with rainbow reflections. As I studied the light, a second one appeared to the lower left which was moving at a moderate pace and fading from very bright, identical to the stationary light, to nothing at all, then back to very bright. It moved smoothly around the stationary light for about 15 minutes and then moved into trees beyond our view. The stationary light stayed until I had to step away for a minute and when I came back, it was gone as well.;42.1889000000001;-122.6908
strange distant lights moving in zig zag patterns from south to north, one after another aprox. 1 minute apart. ((Satellites??));2004-06-20 23:00:00;1 hour;strange distant lights moving in zig zag patterns from south to north, one after another aprox. 1 minute apart. Very clear sky with no moon light. At aprox. 11: 00 P.M. (Pacific Time) I looked up into the southern sky and saw very small light objects moving one after another from south to north across the night sky in a slightly zig-zag pattern as if from one imaginary point to another in a northerly direction at uneven speeds. Unlike any kind of aircraft I've ever seen. They appeared to be barely visible and at an unusually high altitude for any aircraft that I am familiar with. They darted like insects across a glass window one after another about 1 minute apart, and along different paths which, in my mind, ruled out satelites. I watched for almost an hour and came back out around 12:30 am and there was no sign of them. I have no idea how long this had been going on but would like to know if anyone else witnessed this event. Thank you. I have never filed a report like this before now. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and he sounded quite credible to us.  However, when we explored his sightings, it seemed to us that he might have been witnessing satellites passing overhead.  Given that the objects were observed by the witness as they flew to the east, we suspect that at least some of them may have been satellites.  However, please see other reports from Washington State for the same time and date.  PD));42.1889000000001;-122.6908
very bright greenish blue light the size of a large star moving slowly  NW to SE and back again gaining altitude for 1/2 hour at 3:30;2007-10-13 15:30:00;1/2 hour;very bright greenish blue light the size of a large star moving slowly  NW to SE and back again gaining altitude for 1/2 hour at 3:30 I first noticed a bright greenish blue light high in the northwest sky moving very slowly in a southeast direction. I thought at first it was a helicopter but after a time I realized it was much too high for any helicopter to be flying. After nearly 10 minutes of travelling three quarters of the way across the sky it suddenly stopped. It remained stationary for a minute or two and then headed back the way it came toward the northwest. I assumed it was gaining in altitude as it did so because by the time it reached the northwest position where I first noticed it it was barely perceptable. I stood in the middle of the street and  watched it for aproximately 1/2 hour before it was too high in the sky to see.;42.1889000000001;-122.6908
What everyone sees and only few notice.;2008-06-18 23:00:00;hours upon hours;What everyone sees and only few notice. I see lights in the sky every night i want to and the only person that i have shown them to who doesn't believe me has bad vision and is missing his glasses. I have perfect vision and i see what most people call stars are not actually stars. Stars are behind the clouds and therefore w can not see them most of the time, but flying saucers are those dots we see in the sky every night when we say look no aliens, just stars. The funny thing being that those stars are actually aliens in a flying saucer if you look at it with binoculars. I dare you to look at them with binoculars. You will be suprised or i am schizophrenic, but no one seems to see anything wrong with me besides that and having an open mind. I dare you to prove me wrong. Do it.;42.1889000000001;-122.6908
Fireworks and sighting.;2015-07-04 21:45:00;1 minute;fireworks and sighting At finale of firework display in West an abrupt blue light entered while I filmed.  There was no noise, and first impression was a singular shooting star.  It preceded several orange lights and all abruptly reversed their direction.  Either in a tight formation of as one.  I thought helicopter, or drone but it was extremely fast and noiseless.;42.1889000000001;-122.6908
gf and I spotted star like obj. in the night sky that began gliding in the night sky seamlessly towards the E. ((anonymous report));2018-05-20 22:00:00;15 minutes;gf and I spotted star like object in the night sky that began gliding in the night sky seamlessly towards the east, and on gf and I spotted star, like object in the night sky that began gliding in the night sky seamlessly towards the east, and once the spacecraft passed of the mountains and out of  sight... 40-60 Seconds later, a extremelely fiery bright comet-like object shot from east to west, streaked completely from east to west until disappearing over the western mountains. The obejct appeared to be wrapping around the horizon as i chased until i lost sight.  Also noticably throughout there we no aircrafts during the entire sighting of the spacecraft, and moments after the craft streaked through the air, 2 airplanes with regular airplane jet noises and lights flew over as if the experience never happenedâ€¦ ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact  information.

Bright green glowing light came down mountain flew over i5 then dissapeared.;2019-07-20 23:24:00;10 seconds;Bright green glowing light came down mountain flew over i5 then disappeared. I was driving home from baby sitting my cousin and was driving on Main Street just about a mile or 2 outside of town. All of a sudden I saw a bright green glowing light come over and down the mountain on my right (like it was coming from Mt. Ashland). it got low and probably 300 feet over my car and then stopped descending and moved flat towards i5. wind it got to the interstate, it just disappeared.;42.1889000000001;-122.6908
Bright light moving very slowly across the sky suddenly seems to dissapear while quickly accelerating;2019-08-01 21:30:00;30 seconds;Bright light moving very slowly across the sky suddenly seems to dissapear while quickly accelerating The smoke from neighboring fires finally ceased direction and I was looking to the skies to point out satellites to a friend. While my friend went inside I noticed a very bright slow moving light,  I began to test if my phone camera would pick it up it did. After filming 12 seconds, I stopped the recording and refocused on the object with my eyes. Within 5 seconds the light almost appeared to stop living then shrank in both size and light intensity before vanishing completely. I observe aircraft and satellites daily and this is unlike anything I've seen first hand.;42.1889000000001;-122.6908
