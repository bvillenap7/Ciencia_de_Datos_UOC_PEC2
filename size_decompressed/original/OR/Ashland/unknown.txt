At first it just looked like a star untill I noticed it moving. It did not maintain its orbitol course and made what appeared to be a slow 45 degree turn.It then faded out of view on its new course.  I would have to consult an aerospace engineer as this seems to be well within our earthly technologies. The reason this is odd to me is I have been an avid star gazer and in the past have never observed an orbiting satelite change course in a couple of minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
