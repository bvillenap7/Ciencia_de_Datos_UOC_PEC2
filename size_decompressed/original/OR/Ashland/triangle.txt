At first I thought it was a big bird of some sort the way it was gliding in the sky.  It was reltively low in the sky especially compared to the jet I had been observing.  The object passed silently overhead and it was like the shape of a boomerang.  It was'nt glowing or lit but yet it was oddly illuminated like it was reflecting the light from the valley floor.  (I-5 is nearby and Ashland and Medford are well lit)  I have seen many other craft and strange lights over the past 40 years but this was very unique to my experience with UFO's.  In my judgement it was around 3,000 ft. in altitude and moving at a pace that allowed it to remain in my vision for nearly a minute as it passed over, veered right sharply and then took off rapidly due east. I can't get that eerie glow out of my mind.  If I had'nt been looking it would have been nearly invisible. Besides the 10/11/99 incident, on the morning of 10/ 14/99 at 4:15 AM a gigantic fireball was seen from my home in the southeastern sky.  It was not a shooting star but a gigantic golden fireball steaking across the sky.  We have been seeing many strange things in the sky here lately.  Southern Oregon is being chemtrailed at least once aweek for months now and it is so thick sometimes the blue sky is completely hazed over within minutes.;42.1889000000001;-122.6908

After about 2 minutes observation  the bottom left light faded out then the bottom right light faded out, and finally the top light extinguished.   We were stunned at this sighting.  I hope other observers will report this sighting.   There was a 3/4 moon rising at the time and a few scattered clouds in the sky but not in the area of the sighting. ((NUFORC Note:  Judging from the witness's background, we suspect that he is a very experienced and qualified observer.  PD));42.1889000000001;-122.6908

Constant bright point of light like an illuminated satellite at the head of a triangular less brightly lit shape much larger than any satellite I have seen.  It moved slowly and steadily through the Big Dipper in a West by Northwest direction until it disappeared behind clouds.   The triangular shape was at a slight angle to the path of movement, unlike a vapor trail.  The triangle did not change shape or size as it moved.;42.1889000000001;-122.6908
