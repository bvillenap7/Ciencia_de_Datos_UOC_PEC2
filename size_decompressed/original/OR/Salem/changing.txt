Am not sur;1999-07-08 22:21:00;8hrs;((NUFORC Note:  The report is not inconsistent with many reports of celestial bodies that we receive routinely.)) At first sight looked like star but kept moving almost in triangle upward motion.  Colors kept changing as it moved upward.  Am not sure exactly when it started but we noticed approxemitely 3-4 wks ago and was a lot further away.  It seems to be getting closer and brighter each night.  Also it seems as though there are smaller objects patroling around it as it moves.  I wish I could get a photo of it but I have tried several cameras, they seem to fade when I get camera. (See summary description)  Also 7/26/99 we were observing the object and disappeared completely.  Now it seemed to have done that the night before but it faded to look almost like a star, but there was still movement from and around the object.  Another detail was that I observed was that 7/26/99 around 23:00 hrs... there was a lot of activity around it more than usual.  At the very least there were 8 of them.  I am working mother of 2 children I am really concerned about all of this activity that is going on,  would like for someone to look into this.   Tried reporting to the proper authorities but was given the run around and directed to your website.  I called my local airport, police and journalism sources but was ignored. (ALSO IF YOUR ORG. WILL ATTEMPT TO CALL ME I AM HOME AFTER 6PM...I SURE HOPE WE CAN FIND OUT WHAT IT IS);44.9404510516251;-123.019728489483
I SAW A BRIGHT ORANGE LIGHT IN THE SKY  WHICH APPEARED TO HAVE A TAIL OF LIGHT THAT SUDDENLY SPLIT INTO TWO LIGHTS.;2000-06-20 22:25:00;4-5 min;I SAW A BRIGHT ORANGE LIGHT IN THE SKY  WHICH APPEARED TO HAVE A TAIL OF LIGHT THAT SUDDENLY SPLIT INTO TWO LIGHTS. I WAS DRIVING HOME FROM THE GROCERY STORE.  I SAW A ORANGE LIGHT IN THE SKY COMING IN THE GENERAL DIRECTION OF MY CAR.  THE OBJECT WAS HALFWAY BETWEEN CLOUD LEVEL AND THE GROUND.  AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS A FIRECRACKER RIGHT BEFORE IT GOES OFF SO I KEPT WATCHING IT, BUT IT NEVER EXPLODED.  IT KEPT IT SAME COURSE OF MOVEMENT.  THEN  I SAW THE SAME ORANGISH LIGHT STREAMING DOWN FROM THE ORIGINAL LIGHT WHILE THE OBJECT WAS STILL MOVING.  I PULLED INTO MY DRIVEWAY AND HOPPED OUT OF MY CAR TO GET A BETTER LOOK.  MY BOYFRIEND HAD COME OUT OF THE HOUSE AND SEEN WHAT I HAD BEEN LOOKING AT.  WE WERE WATCHING THE LIGHT CONTINUE TO MOVE WHEN WE SAW THE STREAM OF LIGHTS THAT HAD BEEN STREAMING DOWN WHIP ITSELF UP AND AROUND THE ORANGE LIGHT. AT THAT MOMENT THE ONE ORANGE LIGHT SPLIT INTO TO TWO AND BOTH LIGHTS STARTED SPINNING AROUND EACHOTHER.  YOU COULD NOT SEE THE SKY BETWEEN THE SPINNING LIGHTS.  THERE WAS SOMETHING OF SUBSTANCE IN BETWEEN THEM.  MOMENTS AFTER THAT THE UFO FLEW INTO LIGHT CLOUD COVER AND DISAPPEARED.  SHORTLY AFTER THAT WE NOTICED A L0T OF ACTIVITY IN THE SKY WITH HELICOPTERS AND PLANES.  WHICH WERE NOT PRESENT BEFORE THE INCIDENT WE HAD WITNESSED.;44.9404510516251;-123.019728489483

They were changing pattern quite fast, not zipping though, some were big and some smaller.  At one point I noticed that the formed a nice oval, at that point the brightest one was red and in the middle... they were traveling South.  I posted on Facebook to see if anyone else noticed but I got no response so far. By the time I was able to take a picture they were far and almost invisible, I will send it to you anyway, if you can take a look at it the cluster is in the very middle of it.;44.9404510516251;-123.019728489483

Then i noticed that it had moved a good length.   So i closed my blurry eye n this object kept moving n displaying an incredible light show.  It wuz so peaceful...  It appeared to throw off glitter like or pixie like dust to the shape it took n it would slowly dim off b4 doin it over n over...  Amazing...  I called my gf to come out n see it, so i know i wuznt the only one seeing it.  Then it slowly took itz time getting higher n further away til it wuz not visible...

I ran over to see what she was talking about and there was a large group of floating/shifting shiny objects not far from above our home. At first I thought they were birds they looked like they had wings at first but the way they were shining and moving seemed wrong. Perhaps, a large group of foil balloons tied together or drones? They kept getting further away and they would shift around together quickly, change formation shape and become invisible at times. My husband and 3 year old were also watching. Barely captured part of it on video.;44.9404510516251;-123.019728489483
