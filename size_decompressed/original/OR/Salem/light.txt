THEY WERE NOT BLINKING. WENT INTO THE BACK YARD TO CHECK ON THE CATS ABOUT 1:30 AM AND WAS DOING A LITTLE STAR GAZING WHILE I WAS AT IT.. ABOUT 1:35-1:40 I SAW WHAT APPEARED TO BE A SINGLE VERT BRIGHT' LIGHT COMING FROM ALMOST DUE NORTH, BUT IT MAY HAVE BEEN SIGHTLY NORTH-EAST.. ANYWAY IT SO BRIGHT AND NOT MAKING ANY NOISE I RAN INTO THE HOUSE AND GOT THE BINOCULARS AND WAS ABLE TO FOCUS ON THE LIGHT AND SAW IT HAD 3 SMALLER LIGHTS BEHIND IT. TWO SMALL WHITE ONES AND A SINGLE BLUISH-GREEN ONE.. NO RED OR STROBE LIGHTS LIKE AIRCRAFT THAT FLY OVER ALL THE TIME. MY FIRST THOUGHT IT WAS A SATELLITE AS IT WAS MOVING SO FAST AND QUIET BUT IT WAS NOT HIGH ENOUGH AND WAS TOO BRIGHT. IT WAS ALMOST AS BRIGHT AS THE EVENING STAR...I WATCHED IT FOR ABOUT 3 MINUTES AND IT WAS STILL BRIGHT ENOUGH TO SEE IT WITH THE NAKED EYE.. I MADE THE COMMENT TO MYSELF, AS IT WAS ABOUT GONE FROM SIGHT, IT MUST BE OVER EUGENE BY NOW NOTE, EUGENE IS ABOUT 72 MILES SOUTH OF SALEM.;44.9404510516251;-123.019728489483

My wife and I were driving East on State St. Between Lancaster Dr. Cordon Rd. When suddenly from no where appeard in front of us a bright green light. It appeared to be falling and had a tail that you would expect to see on a fast moving burning object, but was desending very slowly as if it had no wieght what so ever. It looked as if it decended into the Cascade Mountains somewhere. It was nearly Impossible to judge the distance to this thing It could have been a couple of miles away or it could have been a couple of hundred miles away.

red light in southern sky;2001-08-02 02:00:00;5 minutes;red light in southern sky was switching water around for nightly watering duties at work.  looked up into the southern sky, saw what i thought was a red star, as Mars has been in the southern sky the past month.  but then remembered that Mars was in the Southwestern sky and this red star (more of a burn Orange to Red), was directly south.  Then I noticed the star moving to the north.  I shook my head in disbelief.  Looked at it again, and it sure was moving.  If I had a ruler with me, and held it to where i first saw it until it took a 90 degree squared turn to the east, it would have traveled about 4 to 6 inches, then traveled the same distance to the east from the turn.  The light then flickered a couple times like it was loosing power and then disappeared.  Tried to make visual contact again, after moving to a darker area, and was unable too.

At the time I was observing, the area in the sky was around the big dipper.  It was a clear night and there were no clouds visible at the time.  At fist glance I thought i was observing Mars, but at second glance I observed the light in the sky pulsating several times.  I had watched this in the sky for several minutes not believing what i was seeing and trying to make a rational decision on what I was seeing.  Within the timeline I had made up my mind due to the fact that this light was blinking in and out several times at one point disapearing for several seconds.  I then lost sight of the light when I turned and headed North on hwy 99west.  I want to be sure in what I was seeing so if there are any other people around the area of Salem Oregon who also observed this light report it as well thanks.;44.9404510516251;-123.019728489483

Two red lights moving very quickly made two changes of direction in less than 20 seconds.;2003-08-15 21:30:00;2 minutes;Two red lights moving very quickly made two changes of direction in less than 20 seconds. My 11-year-old saw two red lights in the southern sky just after it got dark. He doesn't remember if they were flashing, but he is certain there were two lights and they were very close together. They moved due west very quickly, then he saw them change direction and head back due east. After passing to the east of the point where he first observed them, they headed toward the north. The lights stayed the same distance apart the whole time. Their speed was what caught his eye. The total sighting was less than a minute, about 17-20 seconds. They were very small, about the size of a grain of corn (or smaller) held at arm's length. They were about 3/4 of the way up from the horizon. No sound. An airplane was in the vicinity near the time of the sighting but he can't remember if it was before or afterward.;44.9404510516251;-123.019728489483

But as it passed over, it seemed to change direction slightly toward the East-Southeast before dimming out as it reached 30-40 degrees above the horizon. Definitely not an aircraft. Possibly a satellite. But when it dimmed to barely visible it stayed that way for several seconds before going out completely not like an object with the sun being reflected off of it, which should have dimmed out completely right away. ((ADDENDUM FROM MUFON/OREGON)) Probably satellite sighting This is in reference to the above previously reported sighting. Based on a Starry Night computer simulation of satellite orbits, a crossing of the International Space Station occurred from 18:25 to 18:31 on the night in question. This very closely coincides with the witness' observation from Salem, Oregon.  I am suggesting that this sighting is a _probable_ observation of the International Space Station. The report says the incident occurred at 18:00, but no data submitted as to how the exact time was confirmed.

Hurt my skin and eyes. Went outside to have a smoke. Was sitting looking due south. Somewhat clear night. I immediately was what I thought was Jupiter, but very bright and larger than ususal. Then I though, wait a minute, Jupiter should be in the east. The moon was out 2/3 full to the left/east of this light. A jetliner was passing to the left of the moon and the object.  Light/large star continued to just be there for a minute or so. Then all of a sudden it started to grow large, very large, about 1/3 the size of the moon. Very,very bright. The brightest white light I have ever seen.  My mind was racing looking for any other lights around it-like landing lights-or sound, no sound, it was dead silent. As this light reached its maximum.  It shrunk down to nothing very rapidly and --nothing.  Later that night my eyes were very uncomfortable and my face cream burned when I put it on.  The next morning, fog had come in, and the oncoming headlights of traffic hurt my eyes badly.  I had to wear sunglasses half the entire day. Felt weird. My nextdoor neighbors porch lights went out.

Multiple crafts sited;2007-07-04 00:15:00;30+ min.;Multiple crafts sited I was sitting outside after watching fireworks with my family, I was alone. I looked up at the sky and I focused on one star. After a while I noticed the star started moving. I thought my eyes were playing tricks wth me, so I focused on another star. To prove my point the second star didn't move. I turned toward the first star. It was still there but in a different location. I kept looking at it think it might have been a plane, but I don't know of any plane that emits a white light and hovers. So then I thought it was a helicopter. But I know helicopters can't fly that high. Then it moved in a straight line, but it wasn't no usual line. As it was moving it would shuttered. It would dip down and then back up, while keeping it's forward momentum. Then it stopped. During this time I was rushing around to find my video camera, but when I found it I couldn't focus enough on it to get a good picture. I couldn't see anything through the camera, so I put it down. And in the corner of my eye I saw more movement. I turn towards the movement and I noticed two lights moving in a cirrcular motion. They stopped and then one took off going away from me and as it was leaving it would pulse a white light. It would light up and then slowly die out. It repeated this until I lost sight of it. Then I looked at the other one. It did the same thing maybe a minute later. Then I looked back at the first star. It was in the same area but once again it moved in location. Then I saw another light leave from the star I was looking at and I followed that with my eyes. Then I would look at other lights noticing that most of them moved in the way the first one did. I kept watching them, not noticing the almost 2 hours have past. I hated to leave it but I had to go to sleep. But all day today I have been thinking about what I had seen last night. I still don't know what to make of it.;44.9404510516251;-123.019728489483

I see many airplanes in the night sky, but this had no running lights.  It was just pure white light.  Suddenly, it just stopped in place and quit moving.  Then, it got dimmer and dimmer while continuing to remain stationary.  It seemed to be ascending at a very rapid rate up into the stratosphere.  This whole incident occurred in about fifteen seconds.

Two Parallel Lights Moving At Very High Speed Along An Unusual Path;2007-12-08 21:12:00;7 seconds;Two Parallel Lights Moving At Very High Speed Along An Unusual Path It was a clear, cold evening in Salem, OR.  The temperature was about 36 degrees, perhaps two degrees above the dew point.  My wife and I were in our spa.  It is situated where two legs of our house (an “L” shape) join such that we have a clear view towards the north and east.  Some trees block a horizon view to the east, and the house blocks the view to the southwest.  There is considerable ambient light.  At 2112 (PST) I noticed two lights moving from the northeast to the southwest.  They were moving parallel to each other, being apart about the same distance as two of the stars in the Big Dipper handle, and half as bright as Mars.  [I think it was Mars I was seeing in the northeast sky.]  I said to my wife, “Look at that!”  They passed right over the top of us, just after which my wife located them.  When they disappeared two seconds later, she said, “What was that?”  They moved fast and in straight lines.  About seven seconds elapsed between the times I first saw them above the trees until they disappeared behind my roof.  All I could see were lights, and the lights never varied until they were almost gone.  No noise was heard, although the damned low-speed spa pump was on at the time.  It was too late to see satellites.  Had they been aircraft they would most certainly have been heard (a sonic boom, no doubt).  Since the light was either generated by the objects or reflected, in my mind the only “reasonable” explanation is they were birds.  However…  These two “birds” had to be low (considering their speed) and expert fliers (to perfectly maintain their wide spacing).  They must have had bright underbodies to reflect the light.  City light varies, hence reflection varies, but their brightness didn’t vary.  I sense they weren’t that low, hence the perception of significant speed.;44.9404510516251;-123.019728489483

All the sudden I saw what looked like a bright light about 1000-2000 feet above me. I had not seen where it came from.  After a minute it was joined by 2 more bright objects. I tried to look at them to see if they were gulls, or something else.  They did not move in the pattern a gull would.  I also thought about balloons, but again they do not move the way these did, no floating etc, these moved in deliberate movement. First 1 light, then being joined by another and just sitting still, no movement. After a couple of minutes of watching the 3 bright lights, all the sudden there were at least 13-15 or more of the objects. Then they began to form triangles some were standard all the same length triangles an then some were much longer and the end lights were closer together forming an elongated triangle.  I watched them come together, move apart, form patterns of triangles and then just move back and sit there. There was one light, and then it was being joined by another and just sitting still, no movement. Then they began moving to form triangles and groups of 3-7 objects in a circle pattern. I was getting ready to go back to work and one of the managers of the place I work came by, I asked him if he could see anything, he said “ no “ and I said come over to where I am standing, and he did and then he said “ Yes I can see something “ I said “ What is it?” and he said “ its not planes, and it’s not birds and I don’t know what they are, but if I had a gun, I would shoot at them”  Just what I needed a trigger happy witness.  So that was when they disappeared. I have a Canon 12x SX 200 IS camera and I did take a couple of pictures but the sun was so bright and it was hard to see anything through the lens.  I have been trying to see if I can find some photo enhancing software to look at the pictures. There is obviously something there in the pictures. So when the objects disappeared, I made a note of the time and went back to work. I did not hear of anyone else seeing them and I did not see them later when I went outside. Note: when I say bright objects, it was like looking at stars in the full daylight type of brightness.;44.9404510516251;-123.019728489483

The object began to slow down, then hovered for about three to five seconds.  Then the object quickly ascended approximately 20-30 feet then quickly descended to the original position.   The object again hovered for a few more seconds then quickly moved to the right faster than any plane I have ever seen.  It made another quick right, stopped, hovered, then made a quick descend out of our sight.   The lights were a yellowish-orange color that pulsated and changed to red.

Six yellow-orange lights with reddish halos moving from NE to SW at midnight on New Year's Eve spaced about 45 seconds apart no sounds;2014-01-01 00:01:00;5 minutes;Six yellow-orange lights with reddish halos moving from NE to SW at midnight on New Year's Eve spaced about 45 seconds apart no sounds My wife and I went out on our deck about a half minute past midnight on New Year's Eve to watch some neighbors' fireworks.  As I lookup up I saw a fairly bright yellow-orange light with a reddish halo around it moving silently from the NE to the SW.   My wife also saw it.  We could not determine how high up it was as the sky was clear and there was no frame of reference.  It did not seem to be a plane or helicopter as the light did not blink and there was no sound.  It moved moderately fast covering perhaps a 45 degree arc of sky in about a minute.  As we watched, a second light came into view over our roofline from the same direction and on the same route as the first.  It was about 45 seconds behind the first.  Watching the first light, it dimmed as it got further from us, then was not seen.  Changing to watch the second, a third light appeared, same time interval, same path.  This occurred six time six lights.  Several of them seemed to change their course slightly to the south as they moved away.  Because of our roofline, I was not able to observe where any of them originated. I thought perhaps the lights were some kind of flares suspended from balloons - but they moved too identically for that in my opinion.  Another thought was some type of crafts watching the firework displays for New Years.  However, there were very few fireworks seen our deck has a good view over the city.  The only other thing I could think of was some kind of night maneuver with our local national guard unit - but I don't think our small unit has six helicopters.  I have read some other observations of similar light sightings over the past months.;44.9404510516251;-123.019728489483

My two friends and I were in our backyard on the patio around 7:30 PM. It was pretty much daylight. We were chatting when I noticed what I can only describe as a ball of light traveling West to East (I was facing South). The object did not have a clearly defined outline--no hard edges.  It was a bright luminous mass and while I would describe it as round in shape it did not appear perfectly round or disc-like.  It was moving quickly, was completely silent and moved in a straight line. We tracked the object as it moved in and out of sight behind trees.  It was not high in the sky. Just about the time we lost sight of the object, another one appeared.  It looked like the other one and moved along the same path. Again, we tracked it until it moved out of view.  It was not shaped like a plane and none of us had ever seen anything similar moving in the way these objects did.  One might describe this as having the characteristics of a comet. It gave the impression of a gaseous ball of light, in that it did not appear solid exactly.  And while you could not see through the object, it had a translucent character.  It had soft edges and a glow or aura.  Shortly after this event we did see several planes in the sky, which only reinforced how very unique the previous objects were.;44.9404510516251;-123.019728489483
Lights above Salem Oregon.;2019-10-23 03:00:00;30 minutes or more.;Lights above Salem Oregon. Looked to be one craft that was bluish white and leaving a light trail as it moved back and forth erratically then up and down. Didn’t seem to have a pattern to its movements but kept in the general same area and bobbed all over. Lasted quite a while and was still there when I went to the bedroom. Got up an hour later and it was gone.;44.9404510516251;-123.019728489483
50+ lights perfect spaced flying over our heads, about 20min in the lights were coming in a formation.
