Just after midnight of the morning of September 5, 2007 I saw a bright orange rectangular object in the northeastern sky. At first I thought it was the moon seen through clouds, but the shape was too close to the horizon and in front of the Cascade range to have been the moon. And the shape was so unusual and so ‘unnatural’ that I was totally puzzled. As I watched for about the first 10 minutes, the object moved away back toward the northeast and disappeared.  I left my window for about five minutes but returned out of curiosity to see if the object had returned. As I looked, the object did begin to reappear but this time the shape changed to an actual triangle but retained its bright orange appearance. I decided to go quickly and get my binoculars that were in the car in the garage. I was not sure if the object would be there when I returned.  When I returned, perhaps within 30 seconds, with my binoculars, I was able to focus more clearly on the object. It was definitely a triangle and had moved closer moving toward the southwest. It stopped and stayed in one place and as I watched through the binoculars, three orb or globe-shaped spheres, all smaller in size than the object itself and seemingly ‘colorless’, emerged and moved around the object. Two of the orbs floated at the base of this triangle of light. The third remained somewhat stationary.  The now four objects remained in place for about 15 minutes and then seemed to drift back toward the northeast and finally disappeared altogether. I called our local police to see if anyone else had seen or reported what I had seen, but the police said that no other calls had been reported.  I do not know if I even believe in UFOs, but I have to say, I saw something I could not identify, it was flying and it was an object.;44.9404510516251;-123.019728489483

Object was floating and moving and circling all at once defided logic in how it moved.;2020-05-27 19:30:00;3 minutes;Object was floating and moving and circling all at once defided logic in how it moved. On a clear night on 05/27/20 at 19:30 I observed a jet flying a north/south direction probably from Portland Or. The sun was still shining and was reflecting on the silver jet. Later 5 minutes had passed and I watched the jet contrails. In the contrails or below I saw the object. It was rectangular in shape silver in color reflecting off the sun. The object was moving the same direction the jet had flown but was also turning in a circular clockwise direction. I observed this object for a full 3 minutes. It seemed to be floating and moving all at once. It then left my viewing area.;44.9404510516251;-123.019728489483
