(End of NEWS COPY) ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// On 25 Jan. 2003, I spoke with the witness via land line to get more details on the sighting that occured in Salem, Or. Here is a brief out take of the conversation Sighting Time abt. 5:05pm Duration 1 to 1 1/2 min. Direction West Object path Travelling from north to south 20 degrees off horizon. ONE object. Altitude Approx 20,000 to 30,000 feet estimated Weather Partly cloudy, temp 48 degrees. Distance Approx. 2 miles Witnesses 2//sighted from N. Portland Rd and Haysville Rd. Salem, or. (((Object Video Taped for abt 45 sec.)))) Witness description of the object was cylintrical shape, round and long, brightly lit colors of orange/yellow. Object emitted a flame out the rear of the craft unlike any normal commercial a/c would do, to the extent of 6-7 times the length of the object itself. Again witness described the object as rounded cylinder tube shape, dark grey, which was noticed through his Canon Video cam, which had a zoom of 800X power. Witness also claims that object was moving across the horizon faster than a normal commercial a/c would fly, going from the North to the South abt 20 degrees off the horizon at a very high rate of speed. Witness called several law enforcement agencies, and some news stations, KPTV Fox News aired the tape abt 6 am on the 23rd of Jan. 2003, they still have the original tape, which will be returned to witness soon. I have asked the witness for a copy of the video which will be availible soon. Witness also stated showing the video tape of this strange object to local Military Reserve troops, and their claims were that they could not identify what kind or if the object was any a/c they could identify, and they were as curious as to what it was as the witness. This investigator will follow up on this case and look at the video tape for further details as to what it may have been, thus far, it is unidentified... Ron Wright,Director, TRIAD RESEARCH Colo. Sprgs, Co. LoneWolf@codenet.net ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Ron Wright, long-time UFO investigator in Oregon, for submitting this report, and we welcome him back to the Pacific Northwest from his most recent home in Colorado.  We will withold judgment on this case, until the tape has been reviewed by the investigator.  However, we observe that a major norht-south air traffic corridor is located just west of Salem, and the time of the sighting is correct for the setting Sun to be reflected off a contrail behind a commercial or military jet.  If anyone has information about this case, we would encourage them to contact Ron Wright at the address above.  PD));44.9404510516251;-123.019728489483
Vertical cylinder w/red round objects varying in number from 2 to 4 in center mixed with intense bright lights;2007-11-04 16:00:00;7 minutes;Vertical cylinder w/red round objects varying in number from 2 to 4 in center mixed with intense bright lights Object appeared high in the N.E. sky at approximately 16 hundred hours.  Moved due south direction until it was due east of my position. It seemed to stop breifly, then changed direction and moved due east away from me until it dropped out of view.  Object was in view for about 7 minutes. Object was totally silent and moved very slowly. Clear conditions, no clouds, calm. Object appeared to me to be a verticle cylinder, very faint. I was viewing with binoculars. My wife also saw the object but didn't notice the cylinder, just the intense red center with bright lights. In its center there were bright red balls which seemed to pulsate and change in number from two to four. Around these were intense bright lights. Their appearance was like a cars bright headlights. Their color was more like a car's headlights then like what you would expect when viewing a Mylar balloon reflecting in the sun. The object was first noticed by me as I looked up to watch a V tailed Bonanza aircraft fly overhead. My father and I have restored vintage aircraft and I am very familiar with many types of aircraft. This was like nothing I have ever seen. A definite UFO to me. I'm not saying this object was an alien craft but I couldn't identify it and it was odd in nature. When it changed direction it seemed unlikely to me to be a balloon. I thought I should report it to your center.;44.9404510516251;-123.019728489483
Bright flying object spotted near downtown Salem, OR;2012-11-12 00:00:00;5 minutes +-;Bright flying object spotted near downtown Salem, OR A friend and me were heading to downtown on 12th street.  At first when I saw it, I thought it must be a street light at a distance, just a trick of positioning.   But what I saw was in the sky, and my friend saw it too. It was absolutely not a plane, helicopter, or any other sort of aircraft either of us had ever seen.  It was a very bright goldish light, fairly big in size.  I thought it was more circular but my friend said it looked like a cylinder.   Either way, we both saw it fly quickly towards the right and then out of sight.  Very unusual.
