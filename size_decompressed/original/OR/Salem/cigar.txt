Slowly moving cigar-shaped object with unusual flashing lights seen in Salem, OR in 1970's.;1977-05-15 00:00:00;15 minutes;Slowly moving cigar-shaped object with unusual flashing lights seen in Salem, OR in 1970's. I was walking with my boyfriend late at night.  We looked up and saw a cigar shaped object slowly moving overhead with a humming sound.  The lights of this object were most unusual.  There were approximately a hundred lightsof various colors around the equator of the object (parallel to the ground).  These lights would blink off and on making it appear that there was a continuous circle of light moving around the equator of the object (like might be seen with an advertising sign or a carnival ride).  We watched the object for awhile, but quite frankly we were more interested in each other, and so eventually stopped watching this slowly moving object.  Eventually it was gone, but I don't know how. The only aircraft that would be similar to this object would be a blimp, but I have heard that blimps don't travel at night.  Also, the lights were very unusual. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Very Close Encounter.;1986-10-15 02:30:00;25 minutes;Very Close Encounter. Broken fog sky, more like low clouds, approx. 100 foot ceiling in the early morning hour of 2:30am. The morning temperture was perfectly comfortable,absolutely no wind,dry and dead still silents. The object moved slowly through the edge of the fog approx. 1 block to the West going South. I could clearly see small broken glimpses of it but never saw the whole object. After the object got 6 blocks away, it made a 90 degree turn directly North. It passed directly over me at approx. 50 feet. It was moving at walking speed, 200 to 300 feet long, completly smooth surface, cigar shaped, sliver gray in color and a revolving oblong multi-colored light from within. It made absolutely no noise and was unwavering. It was truely a life experience.;44.9404510516251;-123.019728489483
