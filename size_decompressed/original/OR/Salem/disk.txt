Or that the only reason i saw these ships is that the suns brightness exposed them to the surface.;44.9404510516251;-123.019728489483
White to red constant one light, to black saucer.;2012-07-31 10:15:00;1 minute;white to red constant one light, to black saucer. At first I saw a oval shaped VERY bright light that came out of the sky.  I quickly reached in my pocket, and pulled out phone to take a video of it.  When I got the camera up,  I could not see the light anymore while filming.   After watching the film that I had taken, I realized I took this picture of the UFO in some black Stealth form.;44.9404510516251;-123.019728489483
Two disk saucer crafts witness account Salem, Oregon.;2018-11-10 18:35:00;10-12 minutes;Two disk saucer crafts witness account Salem, Oregon. Round disk craft witness account 11-10-2018  Saturday 6:35pm Salem, Oregon.  I am writing this witness account the same evening the event took place.  It is fresh in my mind.  The evening was cold  at  49 degrees and it was a waxing crescent moon large in the sky with no clouds to block the views, I could see the stars very wellâ€¦and Mars also I believe.  I look to my right while driving on Kuebler Ave., heading south, and I saw a silver (dark silver) disk hovering to my right over some large trees in the distance, about a quarter of a mile from me. The saucer type craft  was spinning while hovering mid air.  There were I believe 8 lights around the outside of the disk red, green and white.  Lights also on the bottom which were white.  I was approaching Battle Creek  Rd. and it started to go straight up then head off towards Fairview Ave. where a lot of businesses and manufacturing plants are located.  I decided to follow it, so I turned right on Battle Creek Rd. I lost sight of it for about 30 seconds then it reappeared.  I pulled to the side of the road and took a few pictures and a video.  The craft made no sound at all.  It would dip down low like it was landing, then I would look far away only to see it back up and further than I would think it could make it in just a few seconds. I felt as if I was playing a game of cat and mouse with it for 10 or so more minutes before  thinking about heading home, my two daughters are in the car with me and I needed to get them home.  It was strange there seemed to be no other cars around just us and this UFO.  I then noticed a second disk shaped hovering craft, identical to the one I saw at first, and it was hovering over a large business.  It was truly an awesome sight.   I was able to get several pictures and a couple short videos before leaving which I will email to you.;44.9404510516251;-123.019728489483
