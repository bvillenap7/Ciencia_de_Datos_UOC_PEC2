Orange orb;2000-02-13 02:00:00;10 minutes;Orange orb I was taking a bag of garbage to the dumpester at the back of our house which faces East when I noticed a bright orange light over the mountians.  It was a clear night with a bright moon so I could make out the crests of the Cascades. As I looked at this light it seemed to wobble in it's posion. As I continued to observe itit seemed to move toward me. I continued to watch it inch toward me for another 30 secounds or so when I decided to go inside and tell my wife about this. I went inside, and told her, were upon she said I'll be right out as she was not dressed. I returned to the back of the house where upon I saw that the orange orb was still present and still appeared to be slowly closing in. After a few more moments of watching this my wife came out in her bath rob and saw it immediatly where upon she blurted out call my sister.  I had forgotten that I had our Cell Phone in my coat pocket as we had only had this device for a couple of months. I handed my wife the phone and as soon as she started dialling her sisters number the object gradually diverted its direction away from us and toward the south. As the phone conection was made the orange orb began to move in to a cloud bank that was South and East of us. Unforunatly, her sister was notat home, and her niece ansewred the phone who was not willing to look out the window and was only mildly amused. Eventually the orb disappeared after moving in and out of the clouds as it slowly moved sout.;44.9404510516251;-123.019728489483
Oregon UFO Review Case:  Baseball sized pink object over head.;2002-07-14 22:25:00;5 minutes;Baseball sized pink object over head. As reported to Oregon UFO Research... This witness reports getting off his computer and going outside for a moment. Standing out in the summer evening he looked strait up and noticed a slightly glowing pink object about the size of a baseball but could see no form to it. He then stepped out back to see if his dogs were fed and when he returned he looked up again. The object had now began to move from a hover exactly straight overhead to more of a southern position. He reports that the object moved in a fluttery manner without sound. He then ran in and grabbed his son to view the object as it moved slowly to the south out of view. The witness writes...Another object way higher and about the size of a pee went over head in exactly the same direction...this one had a white look to it and a small red light. It wasn't an airplane. I have seen too many airplanes now to know this wasn't it. It flew in the same odd manner as the first object.;44.9404510516251;-123.019728489483

Fast Moving Bright Light;2003-12-29 21:15:00;5 seconds;Fast Moving Bright Light Temperature was 29 degrees F., sky clear.  My wife and I were outside in the spa.  I spotted an object moving from the NE to the SW.  First appearance was at about 1030 (with 0900 being the east horizon, 1500 the west).  It was round and about as bright as the brightest star visible in the southeastern sky.  My wife saw it immediately, as I said something like meteor when I first saw it.  But it moved slower than a meteor and didn't disintegrate.  I followed it until it disappeared behind the roof of the house (I stood up to extend my viewing time).  Its highest point was just to the south of us.  I then asked my wife about what she saw.  How large?  About six times as large as the brightest star (which was the EXACT figure I had in mind).  Color?  Slightly orange (I agreed).  Nature of the light?  A bit diffuse, as though an intense light was shined on a cloud.  Agreement again.  The track never varied.  There was no noise.  There was nothing visible around the light.  Its intensity never changed.  A satellite?  No, it was too late in the evening to see satellites, and the track would be quite unusual for it to be either a satellite or space debris.  A meteor?  Possibly, but given its speed, constancy and duration, unlikely.  It was definitely not an airplane (no sound, no flashing lights).;44.9404510516251;-123.019728489483
Object changed directions several times.;2004-05-03 15:09:00;six minutes;Object changed directions several times. UFO Incident   Monday, May 3rd, 2004,  time 3:09 to 3:16 PM while on a work break outside in SE Salem not far from the Salem airport observed an object in the sky at  cloud level. It was silver color and the sun reflected from its metalic appearance. It appeared to be round but when turning it had a slightly different look.  There were three of us who observed this and one co-worker spotted it first.  It appeared to be rather stationary at first and our thoughts were that it might be a weather balloon but as it started to move West it seem to defy prevailing wind currents and began to dismiss that therory. It appeared about the size of a pea at that altitude. Then it started back in an Easterly direction for abit and then turned south and sayed on that course for a couple minutes not moving to fast, finally it turned east again and went into the clouds and break was over.;44.9404510516251;-123.019728489483
Thought it was a Satellite until witnessing a very bright flash of light come from the object.;2009-08-10 22:23:00;20 sec;Thought it was a Satellite until witnessing a very bright flash of light come from the object. While looking at the western sky noticed a small dot in the sky traveling from north to south. Thought it was a satellite at first as it was very small and seemed to be traveling at the speed I am use to seeing from a satellite. The odd thing was as we were watching the small dot it suddenly started to glow with a very high intensity light so much so that I thought it was a helicopter spotlight. The light only lasted for a few seconds then went back to normal and the craft continued on a southerly course at the same speed before fading out. I have an aviation background and do not think it was an aircraft given the small size, the speed of the object and the brightness of the flash.;44.9404510516251;-123.019728489483

Red flashing light over downtown salem oregon, then hovers over bush park.;2015-03-07 19:30:00;4 minutes;red flashing light over downtown salem oregon, then hovers over bush park. This was in the middle of downtown Salem.  I can't be the only one.   I was at Mission Mill Museum, taking trash out the back. It flew right over me, semi big, no sound, primarily redish orange.  It was pulsing white and red.  It was low enough where the building would have blocked it out if I was standing on the other side.  Flew quickly (faster than an airplane) over 12th St. and Willamette University soccer field.  Then stopped 5 blocks further over Bush Park area and just hovered for about 2 mins.   I grabbed the only person around (an older laidy) she agreed it was hovering and looked abnormal.  It stayed for about 2 mins.  Moved further slowly, then blinked in and out a few times, the disappeared, like someone turned off the light switch.   I took a video.;44.9404510516251;-123.019728489483

UFO sighted in Salem, OR, over park at around height of airplanes and is white and shiny with translucent halo blinks out & comes back.;2015-07-14 17:10:00;4 minutes;UFO sighted in Salem, OR, over park at around height of airplanes and is white and shiny with translucent halo blinks out & comes back. My two young daughters and I were at Clark Creek park in Salem, Oregon, 07/14/15 at around 5:10 pm.  The sky was clear and blue with a few clouds and it was a warm nice day.   I looked up near the southeastern part of the sky and noticed a stationary white object that was round, and had a sort of white or metallic look to it.  It might have very slowly moved while we observed it, but I can't be sure.   I had my Canon camera with me at the park, so I started to film it, and it was hard to keep it steady because my kid started crying, as most toddlers do when the stroller stops moving.   My 5 year old was talking about it as we have talked about ufos in the past and she was very interested in it.   It disappeared right before our eyes after only being there for a few short minutes, and we continued walking in the park picking berries.  I looked up again to see and it showed up again in around the same area of the sky.  It sort of had a translucent halo around it that was very! hard to see but I noticed it nonetheless.   It disappeared again and we were pretty excited.   A regular big white airplane showed up and flew past the area we had sighted the ufo, maybe the same height in the sky as well, and according to the size of the plane I'll guess that ufo was maybe half the size of the plane and a much brighter shiny white color.  I have witnessed and filmed some other objects before, and my husband and I are very interested ufo researchers.  He has college background I have graduated high school and we're intelligent and read a lot.  This type of sighting only has me feeling they will be back again.  I have submitted a report to MUFON and uploaded the video I shot today as well.;44.9404510516251;-123.019728489483

Two balls;2015-09-24 21:00:00;~10 seconds;I was walking down the street in West Salem, OR, and it was completely black outside.  The sky was cloudy and full of trails.   Two balls of light appeared  suddenly from the South and traveling North.  They were a distance apart, but simultaniously on the same path and appearing to be going the same speed.   Suddenly, one ball appeared to speed up and merge with the second ball and it became brighter and then they quickly separated never leaving the path.  Immediately after the separation, one vanished and the other faded out.   These lights were very bright like a star, but too low to be a star and WAY too fast to be an aircraft.   Dogs were barking in the neighborhood I can only assume it was from the strange sight, but I couldn't say for sure.

So I quickly snapped the pictures and sent them then I reviewed the pictures later and noticed the object. The object is a blue spherical shape that appears just above the trees.   I am sending two images that show the clouds behind the object moving but the object stays stationary.  As I looked at the picture closer and zoomed in the object appears to have texture of some sort. ((NUFORC Note:  The blue-green object appears to us to be a lens flare.

Lights seen over Salem same week as obj. witnessed in skies over Independence, OR.   ((NUFORC Note:  Submitted by Mr. Ron Wright.  PD));2017-06-12 19:30:00;10;Lights seen over Salem, Oregon same week as object witnessed in skies over Independence, Oregon! 15 Dec. 2017 6:48pm. On this date and time, this investigator spoke with the witness (who is also a relative of mine)  This was in regards to a sighting of strange lights seen from his father's back yard in the area of East Salem, cross streets 45th and State Street on Wednesday 6 Dec. 2017. (witness says it may have been the day before, Tuesday 5 Dec. 2017). How this sighting came to the attention of this investigator, I had posted a photo only with no details of a sighting that took place in Independence, Oregon on my Facebook.  My cousin contacted me through a post that he had seen the same object as he was looking west of Salem the same week of the Independence incident. Witness was out with his dog in the back yard, looked up at about 60-70 degrees off the horizon to the west, saw an object with multiple lights (yellowish at some point) stationary- then seemed to be rotating.  Square lights could be seen, 7 of them in a row, a perfect line. Witness said if he held out this thumb, object was larger than the end of his thumb.  Distant estimated 1/2 to 1 mile west of his location. Witness stated the object was hovering, lights rotating then it blinked out.  It is this investigator's belief that this witness may have seen the same object and lights that were seen by 2 or more witnesses in the Independence/Buena Vista area of Polk County.  Witness sent a drawing of what he saw.  From the drawing showing the 'square' lights/windows it is consistant with the previous report and sighting in Independence, Or.  (See drawing) ((NUFORC Note:  We express our sincere gratitude to Mr. Ron Wright, a skilled and experienced UFO investigator in Sprague River, Oregon, for preparing this report, and submitting it to our Center.
