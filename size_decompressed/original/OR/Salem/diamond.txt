Shaped as a diamond and flashing red, white, green and blue lights.  It was stationary. Standing in my kitchen, facing Southeast about 3 or 4 miles up, was a diamond shaped object flashing red, white, green and blue lights.  It was stationary for 2 or 3 hours.  5 people watched off and on for about 3 hours.  Another neighbor also watched this object.  1 person who stayed up and kept checking on it said later there were more objects and that they formed a pattern in the sky.  I went on the web to check Dr. Sky and see what was in the SE area and Jupiter seemed to be the only object.  Could it have been Jupiter I thought?  But flashing colored lights?  Very strange.  We believe we saw a UFO, however I wish it would have been closer.;44.9404510516251;-123.019728489483
Sighting over downtown Salem, Oregon.;2015-08-20 14:16:00;~30 seconds;Sighting over downtown Salem Oregon While driving East over the Center Street Bridge I looked up over the skyline of downtown and saw the craft in the sky.  It was flat and square with silver and black.  It was high enough up above the buildings that it was alone in the sky.   At first I thought it was a small plane but it didnâ€™t have wings.  It was shaped more like a personal drone but upon closer inspection it would have had to be HUGE to be so far away.  It was traveling too fast to be a plane or jet, at an angle that would be impossible.   I watched it for a few seconds trying to figure out what it was, then I blinked and it was gone.  It was too high up in the sky to go behind a building or a tree and if it had fallen, I would have seen it.  This is my first sighting.;44.9404510516251;-123.019728489483
