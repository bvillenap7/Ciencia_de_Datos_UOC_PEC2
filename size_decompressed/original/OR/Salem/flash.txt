Four stationary bright flashes in the constellation of the Swan;2001-09-08 21:30:00;1 minute;Four stationary bright flashes in the constellation of the Swan Saturday night we were observing the constellation of the Swan [Cygnus] when we witnessed four distinct flashes that appeared not far from the tip of the eastern wing.  Each flash lasted about four seconds, with the first being the brightest, and then progressively getting fainter.  When the flashes occurred they were stationary in the sky, and not moving like a meteor, satellite, or plane.  We have observed many planes and meteors for years and this was nothing like any of those occasions.  Each flash flared and then faded without moving, and then reappeared in a slightly different location still within the swan. We have no idea what we saw and are truly at a loss to explain it.  Further, we would appreciate any explanation you might give us.          Thank you;44.9404510516251;-123.019728489483

Brilliant colorful flashing lights moving in a very unconventional way @ 1:30am on January 25, 2014 in Salem Oregon.;2014-01-25 01:30:00;1.5 hours;Brilliant colorful flashing lights moving in a very unconventional way @ 1:30am on January 25, 2014 in Salem, Oregon. At approximately 1:30 AM on January 25, 2014 I was getting into bed and noticed a very bright shining/flickering light in the South-East sky in Salem Oregon.  At first I thought it was an aircraft, but the light emanating from the object didn’t flash in any recognizable pattern as one would expect from an airplane my next thought was that it was a satellite because the flashes it was emitting were full spectrum, it seemed to be emanating all the colors one might expect to see in a rainbow, but this is where it started getting weird, the object started moving in a back and forth pattern very rapidly for a few moments something I've never seen conventional aircraft or satellite do.  It would remain in place for a few minutes, moving in a whiplash back-and-forth movement, then it started to wander lazily in random directions, moving in a westerly direction over the span of about one-and-a-half hours before it disappeared from view.  I reported the lights to a ne! ighbor who also confirmed the lights and the same movement patterns I described.  We could not discern any shape, we could only see the flashing/flickering lights we both described the light as brilliant, agreeing it was far too bright to be a star or a satellite.  As an end-note: I’ve never seen anything remotely like this in my life, and I’m in my 30s.;44.9404510516251;-123.019728489483
06/10/2015, Salem, Oregon, Flash, 2-3 minutes at the most, bright flashes in the sky, 06/10/2015;2015-06-10 02:52:00;3 minutes;06/10/2015, Salem, Oregon, Flash, 2-3 minutes at the most, bright flashes in the sky, 06/10/2015 I saw a bright flash to the North.  I called my son out to see it and within a minute we saw another bright flash, it had moved quite far in that time, and was seen in the northeast sky.  Within 10 seconds another bright flash which would make one to believe it was heading in a northeast direction, again, a great distance from the previous flash.  After that we didn't see it anymore. These are large flashes of light and I have been seeing them for a number of years now and I have never seen anyone reporting in them.  The bright flash does not always stay on course, I've seen many nights that it wifi start in the north, appear next to the east, then back to the northwest. Also, based on the timing of the flashes, this light is moving much faster than an airplane or satellite, or the space station.  In fact, I've seen the light on nights when the space station is not flying over our state. I marked 1-3 crafts due to the fact of distance moved between each flash.  Maybe I'm not seeing one flash flashing 3 times but maybe 3 flashes slashing 1time.  (Does that make sense?;44.9404510516251;-123.019728489483
Silent, explosive lights traveling away from Salem.;2015-08-11 03:10:00;30 minutes;Silent, explosive lights traveling away from Salem. In bed next to girlfriend and woke up because thirsty.  Southwest of the city, flashes/explosive lights filling the sky.   No sounds, just silent, near blinding lights.  Duration was ~1.5s every 2-4 minutes.   As I type, it is continuing to move on a westward trajectory toward the coastal hills.   When closest to this location, streetlights, fans and AC units would dim when flashes occurred.;44.9404510516251;-123.019728489483

While observing the moon tonight at about 9:20 pm PST my daughter said, Look, I saw a flash in the sky over there three times.  I looked where she was pointing, low in the western sky, and then I also saw a bright white Flash.   She then said it was moving.   As we both watched it would randomly flare at intermittent intervals with random duration and intensity.  It climbed to South of overhead and continued to a point South of Jupiter before it was no longer seen by us.  We observed this for 5-6 minutes.  It was bright white in color and would flare intensely and then the next flare may be dim.   The duration of each flare was also random in its length of duration.  It moved through the sky slower than most satellites.;44.9404510516251;-123.019728489483
