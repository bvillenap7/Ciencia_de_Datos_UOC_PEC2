I was a camp counsellor at the time. We were doing some stargazing, when I noticed a speck of light weaving between the stars. I asked a few other people if they saw it too, to make sure I wasn't imagining things. All of the people I asked noticed it immediately as I pointed it out to them. The objects were too high and fast to be any kind of military aircraft, not to mention that it turned sharper and faster than any aircraft I've ever seen. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Subject: RE: Missing Time Mid August 1991    Don't have the date of this event, but suppose I could find it if I were to look for it in;1999-08-15 23:00:00;215;Subject: RE: Missing Time Mid August 1991     Don't have the date of this event, but suppose I could find it if I were to look for it in notes etc., at this time I was in the habit of going outside every evening about 11-11:30 and check out the skies, sometimes I would stay out till midnight if it was really warm.  I would lay down on the picnic table on the patio with a tube pillow under my head,(to keep from getting a kink in my neck) and binoculars on my chest.. I was watching the local ABC 11 o'clock news, my husband was already asleep, having gone to bed several hours before, (his illness forces him to get a-lot of sleep) anyway I know I looked at the clock at 11:15 PM when I opened the patio glass sliding doors and went outside... I laid on the table for what seemed like about 10 minutes, checking out the stars and planets etc, and then I got up and walked around the patio to get a different perspective of the sky.. all the sudden I looked down the back side of the house (NE SIDE) back of house was facing North, and said out-loud but to myself, I need to go make sure my bedroom window is closed it might rain, keep in mind this was August our hottest month of the year, and there was not a chance in Hell of getting any rain.. I came into the house and walked down the hall to my bedroom, to go in and check the windows, the door to the room was almost closed so I reached for the door handle to push it open and the door SLAMMED in my face with a loud noise, I thought  it was a draft from the open window I put my hand on the door to open it and could not turn the knob, I pushed against it, and pulled on it, yelled at it and kicked it, the door was locked, then I remembered that we do not have any room locks on the bedroom doors.... I remember yelling for my husband who is a light sleeper to come and help me, nothing... then I called him again, again nothing so finally I walked away from the door across the hall and went in and bodily shook him awake and he seemed that he was drugged I explained to him what was happening and finally got up and he too tried to open the bedroom door, pulling and pushing.. finally it opened..and one of the cats slipped into the room and came running out growling with a full bottlebrush tail, I went into the room and I felt a bit of vertigo but that’s all... I looked at my bedroom clock and it was 2:15 AM, it had been over 3 hours since I went outside, but it seemed like only about 20-30 minutes. I checked the window and it was closed (no surprise) and then I noticed there was a box on the floor, it had been sitting under the window on the window-seat and it was about 1-2 feet away from the window-seat upside down on the floor, but the contents were not on the floor, nothing was spilled, I am not sure how that was done.. (all that was in the box was ET reports and information)  Finally I got the cats calmed down, husband went back to bed and I shut and locked the patio doors and laid down on the couch, I was barely dozing when my husband yelled from the bedroom... I ran in to see what was the problem and he said Something is touching me, I asked him what it was, cats were not in the room, he said I don't know but I could hear a buzzing sound and when I closed my eyes I could see blue and red lights moving around the room through the crack in my eyes. He said they were not totally closed. He also said I could not move I said Why didn't you open your eyes? and I think he thought I had lost my mind, he said he did not want to see them,he lay back down and about 10 minutes later he was in the living room standing by the couch.. I said  what do you want? he said  I do not want to sleep in there tonight, they keep coming back and touching me  The next morning except for the episode with the door he didn't seem to remember any of the happenings.. he had multiple small scoop ( bb size) marks on his arms. On several occasions my husband as I said who is a light sleeper did not respond to my calls for help or assistance, and he did not get up in the night and find me missing when I was not there..  I personally believe that is the intention of the Et's to keep him sleeping when they are busy with me.

looked like satalight's but they were not,,;2001-04-02 20:45:00;20;looked like satalight's but they were not,, Ok here is what i saw.i am not sure of the date because i am now reporting this and it happend about 1 1/2 months ago. I was walking to meet my friend from her work when i was walking down a dark street with no street light's,i was walking down that street so i can get a clear look at the stars because oregon is usualy cloudy.Anyways i looked up to see three things,one of which was a plane going normal speed,the other two thing were way farther up in the sky moving very fast.It was interesting because the plane was very high and the other objects were way higher but moving way faster.They were both going the same direction keeping the same distance from eachother but flying side by side.I used to watch the sky when i was younger and i saw a lot of satalights,these looked like satalights but you can tell they obviouly were not because satalights do not fly side by side.They also looked like they were in the atmosphere .I watched them go all the way accross the sky untill the were out of sight.I also saw them change course and fly off into the horison. I was looking at them for at least 30 seconds. They were not a jet or anythng like that because jets dont manouver like that and they dont move that fast either.They must have been some kind of new technology.The first feeling i got was that it was some kind of secret government technology.Either that or it was E.T.;44.9404510516251;-123.019728489483
3 Extraordinary close Ufo encounters!!!!!!!!!!!!;2001-06-14 22:00:00;25 mins;3 Extraordinary close Ufo encounters!!!!!!!!!!!! 2 Friends and i were driving home from a 7 day stay at a resort in oregon.  We were driving north bound on the highway.  Heading towards Washington State.  When The driver and i noticed 2 Extremly bright lights from a distance.  I pointed it out to my friend in the back seat.  We started to discuss what it could be.  The driver suggested 2 cruise missles of some sort.  The lights appeared to be hovering up and down and a steady rate going the opposite way down on the north bound highway.  Almost as if observing us in vehicles, poosible taking scans of some sort. As we got closer we noticed the lights were comeing from 2 ufo's going south in the north bound lane.  There was other traffic on the highway at the time, so im sure there were other witnesses other then ourselves.  Even the car infront of us stop abruplty.  I also noticed a semi truck pulled over to the left side of the highway going northbound. The driver of our vehicle slowed down alot so i stuck my head out the window while the car was in motion so i got a good look at the crafts.  The vessicles were about 20 feet from the concrete of the highway.  There was an extremly bright light in the front of the vessicle, then what appeared to be contrete with 3 columns of hieroglyphical writing.  With another brighlight at the end of the vessicle.  We got off the highway about 2 exits up and went into a church parking lot that was write off the freeway to smoke a ciggerate and talk about what we seen before we left the area.  When we noticed a 3rd craft going east passing over the highway.  This vessicle was triangle shaped, dark green with red and yellow tubing that was intergrated into the bottom of the vesslicle.  Possibly some type of piping with fuel being fed to the engines. This triangle shaped ship was moving a bit faster and was noiser then the other 2 seen previously.  After the triangle shaped vessicle passed over us and was no longer in sight we got back in the car about 5 mintues later and left.  As we approached the onra! p to continue driving home to washington we noticed a army truck with 2 soldiers standing on the side of the onrap looking up at the sky ignoring any other distractions.  Diddnt even look at us as we drove by.  We were gonna stop and ask what they were looking at but then we changed our minds and got on the highway and went home.  Were these 3 vessicles some type of new secret military aircrafts or did the army respond to ufo's intrusion into our airspace. We might never know.  But i enjoyed the once in a life time experince if they were extraterrestrials from a advanced race outside of our solar system. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

V shaped, Tilted and  rotating pale white craft. No noise.;2003-07-06 00:04:00;45-65 seconds;V shaped, Tilted and  rotating pale white craft. No noise. Hello and thank you for your services. It is 3am on Sunday the 6th of July. At between 12:03am and 12:05am the 6th of July, i was sitting on my balcony of my appartment and looking up at the night sky. The sky is quite clear tonight and there are a dozen stars visable.  I noticed a pale colored object moving slowly due south across the sky above me.  I stood and squinted(ive lost my glasses)and noticed it was not lit with strobes or anything that most aircraft are required to have.  Then i ran in and grabbed my binoculars and came out for a better look. At the same time i yelled at my girl friend to come look, because she has better vision. I was not completely alarmed when i first saw it, because i thought it was much higher and possibly a sattelite.  When i put the bino's on it, i then freaked out, because what i saw was definately not a known aircraft.  My heart was racing. The craft appeared to be a V shaped thing, or a boomerang shape.  It was tilted roughly 45-65 degrees from the horizon and from my perspective seemed to be between 1500-3000 ft altitude.  It was a pale color, possibly white, and seemed to only be lit by the city lights. I was a bit shakey with the bino's at first but could make out some rough details.  It had some kind of dark/black trim work, but i dont believe it was a silver colored object, because there was not glean or glint from the city lights off of the surface.  Its rotation was counter clockwise and probably no more than 1 revolution per second, but its spin changed slightly from half of that, more or less during its path.  Its path was steady, and in a south direction.   I live just north of the capitol building in Salem, and this craft was just north of being above that building.  Just further south is our airport, and it looked as though the craft got to the vicinity of being above the airport and then it stopped its flight path and hovered, while still spinning.  I climbed my railing for a better look because it was just about to go behind some trees in my line of sight.  When i got up the railing 2 seconds later, and put the bino's on it again it was simply gone.  I immediately called 911 and reported it, if nothing else, there's a record of it if you call them i believe.  I asked if they had any other reports and he said no. I asked if he had a number for the airport. I wanted to contact someone at the radar station, but he said Salems airport(traffic control) was closed at this time of night.  I had about 25-30 seconds of nice veiwing of the craft through my binoculars and have made detailed sketches.  The craft made no noise. It filled my view in the binoculars.  It was roughly 1/2 to 3/4 the size of a full moon from my vantage point.  If i were to make an amature guess, i would say it was possibly close to the size of a chinook helicopter.  It seemed to be traveling at the rate of a helocoptor moving at a fairly slow cruise. But it certainly wasnt any kind of craft ive seen before.  Temperature 65-68 F Clear skys, some slight haze.  Some light polution No other oddities to report, expept a strange encounter with a homeless fellow in a near by park by me and my girl friend 3 hours earlier. (some odd coincidences)  There was one other small plane in the vicinity, but to the south west about 1-2 miles. It was just cruising around. And it DID have the proper lights and strobes.;44.9404510516251;-123.019728489483

Yet there was a dim flashing light that was red. Moving to quickly to be a satelite, and wasn't a meteor because the lights looked like they could have been off a plain..only it was moving to fast.;44.9404510516251;-123.019728489483

I saw a flying craft that was unlike anything I've ever seen.;2007-10-05 20:00:00;2 to 3 minutes;I saw a flying craft that was unlike anything I've ever seen. Approximately three weeks ago, my mother, my 3-year-old son, and I were returning home from shopping at about 8:30 at night. We were on our back porch and we saw a red and orange, roundish mystery objest flying up above about a half mile away. We were all instantly enthralled with the object beacuse it had virtually no form, it was glowing, it was silent, it would stop in mid flight (float would be more like it), and then it would change direction and go in reverse. After about twenty seconds of watching it, the thing started dropping a few burning embers that would burn out before hitting the ground or trees. That was when it started getting really weirs. We thought whatever it was was going to crash but it keep hovering over head, moving very slowly. It continued to do so fo almost another minute and a half and then it started to drop quite a lot of burning embers to the ground (the object itself did not look like it was on fire at all) nad then it just disappeared. It was the strangest thing I've ever seen in my life and I am writing this because I saw an article in the local paper a couple weeks ago about different people witnessing the same thing.

Large Orange Oblong Light Travelling Slowing Across The Sky.;2014-05-01 21:30:00;2 minutes;Large Orange Oblong Light Travelling Slowing Across The Sky. At approximately 9:30 pm on Thursday, May 1st, my husband and I were sitting in our living room with our front door open.  It was a clear night, and our living room was dimly lit.   I just happened to glance out the front door from where I was sitting and saw a large, deep orange oblong light slowly traveling across the sky from the South.  It had no trail and there was no sound.  It was quiet outside.   My husband looked out and we just watched it. We turned our living room light off.   The large, oblong light was at least 3 times the size of a street lamp.  The oblong shape did not change in shape nor size.  It was travelling North.  It seemed to hover so slowly and at one point we were looking directly up.   Then, it started to move further upward and higher at a steep angle above our home.  It travel North East until it just disappeared.   From the time we were looking at it up until the time it disappeared took approximately 2 minutes.

Balloon like clusters over Salem daylight sighting.;2014-09-28 18:10:00;15 minutes;Balloon like clusters over Salem daylight sighting 1.  Where were you and what were you doing at the time? - We were taking a walk in a suburban neighborhood near our apartment, up Cottage St. to Clark Creek Park with our 4 year old & 7 month old daughters around 6:00 PM. It was twilight but still very light out. 2.  What made you first notice the object? - I don't know, I just looked up into the sky and saw the 1st one of the balloon-like clusters. 3.  What did you think the object was when you first noticed it? - The objects looked like balloon clusters at first, descending down from the many wisps of clouds high overhead. Then it became apparent that instead they were some balloon-like cluster UFOs that we'd studied about before. 4.  Describe the object and its actions and motions in detail. - These were the infamous balloon-like clusters, as well as some single spheres that seemed to slowly move in paths. The 1st group had 3 separate sphere clusters, the 2nd group had 2 separate sphere clusters. Some groups had a red sphere within a cluster of apparently white spheres. We've seen many photos, videos and have read about these balloon-like clusters before this event today. They would move along on slowly and then seem to stay in the same area for awhile at times.  5. Describe your feelings, reactions and actions, during and after sighting the object. - We had no strange feelings, just excitement. We've had different types of encounters numerous times, but have never witnessed these balloon-like clusters in person. We've also never gotten any photos or video of any other incidents before this.  6. How did you lose sight of the object? - We never really lost sight of the objects except when they eventually would rise above and beyond certain wisps of high clouds after awhile. We continued on to the public park.  I am emailing photos and a short video clip of the objects;44.9404510516251;-123.019728489483
