ENCOUNTER AT HAYSVILLE CORNFIELD;1971-06-01 00:00:00;5 minute;&quotENCOUNTER AT HAYSVILLE CORNFIELD&quot In early 1999, I re-united with an old high school buddy who had been in contact with my younger brother.  I had not seen RH for about 19 years.  My last time seeing him was 1980.  We picked berries in the fields in early 1970's, hung out at the local skating rink, fun times. RH and I also decided to enlist in the military in 1974 together.  I did so in the USAF, and he went US Army.  After my initial contact made by phone early 1999,  I met up with RH at my home in Tigard, Oregon. His first comment to me was Remember the light in the sky over the cornfield?  That drove me to drink all these years!  Like a rush of memories flooding my mind... it took me back to the summer of 1971 where RH and I were riding late at night on our bikes on Cordon Road, cross road of Haysville in East Salem which was rural farming.   The image of a cornfield, a large oak tree and a bright oval light hovering over the tree.  I was looking SSE direction as the tree was at a slight uphill direction in the middle of the field.  The scene is all I remember, I don't recall any sounds, any other aircraft or individuals, and don't have any memory of what happened after that event.  What transpired that night so many years ago?   RH stood there after making that comment holding a flask, which I presumed was alcohol.  We sat on the deck and talked about that night... neither of us could really make out what happened, but it was evident, it had a severe affect on my friend. For me, seeing this light is all I remember. RH and I kept in touch until his death in 2001. In the spring of 2019 I was in Salem and went out to the crossroads of Cordon Road and Haysville Rd. trying to pin point the area where we had the sighting... a flash back in time as the land, buildings have changed.  There was no longer a cornfield, but the barn was still there to the right and the oak tree was gone.  What happened that evening to scare my friend as bad as it did I don't know... As for me, I was not affected, but my journey into finding answers started in that cornfield in 1971! I hope here sometime in the future to make another trip to the area and talk to some of the residents living there to see if they have had any sightings like mine during the early 1970's. To analyze what we saw, from my experience in the USAF, it was not a conventional aircraft, nor the moon, or a street light, or vehicle headlights because it was in the air at about 30-35 degrees hovering over that oak tree. So at this time, its an unknown.;44.9404510516251;-123.019728489483
EXPLOSION OF CRAFT 1998;1998-05-30 21:00:00;2105;EXPLOSION OF CRAFT 1998 It was May 30th, 1998,  9 PM Sunday night.  Had just finished watching  “Touched By An Angel “ It was warm and a soft breeze had been blowing.  It was twilight, not light, but not dark, the stores had just closed and people were still out, most likely heading home. One of my cats, Patches, now deceased,  was acting strangely and wanted out, so I went to the door and followed her out and glanced at the sky in front of the house. Then I saw it.. a large craft kind of oval in shape, about the size of a car, could not make out the shape, it was diffused light, off in the distance, moving very slowly and seemingly very low altitude towards me.  My husband came out to see what I was looking at and I pulled him down the sidewalk, away from the artificial lights of the house, we were standing by the edge of the house, near the garage. We both noticed that the light in the craft was golden in color, and was flickering like a candle.  All the sudden, the entire craft, ship, blew up, I screamed. Pieces of it blew up, down, and sideways, we could watch the metal burning, and dripping, as I watched the pieces fall, still burning to below the tree line and out of sight. There was no sound.. I ran for the phone and called 911 and reported a “ plane “ might have blown up.  Then I heard sirens and said ‘ Oh someone already had reported this to you? The 911 operator said  “ No, it was an accident on the bridge, “ I said, they probably saw what we did and ran into the wall of the bridge.  So I did report the explosion. Then I called our local airport tower, and no planes were reported in trouble.  I called the military in Portland Oregon because they have a helicopter wing NG in Salem , again no planes or choppers missing or in trouble.  I called PDX and reported it to the tower in Portland , and  then I called SeaTac in Seattle area and again reported the incident. Nothing, but they did take my name in case something or someone ended up not arriving at their destination. I even called Evergreen Helicopters which is located about 28 miles from Salem and again, nothing was reported out of the ordinary. Early the 2nd day / morning sometime after midnight, I was so frustrated that I decided to take a chance and called for the number of Cheyenne Mountain in CO.NORAD might be able to tell me something I called and was very fortunate to have a Air Force man take the call, and explained my reason for the call and he promised to look into it and call me back, I thought I would not hear from him again.  I said, it could be a asteroid or something, but I really needed to know what it was I saw.  So as promised, he called back several hours later. He said “ according to their reports/records, nothing man made entered the Earth's  atmosphere at that time.” I said “ You mean it was a asteroid or something ? “ He said “ You are not listening to me,  NOTHING MAN MADE and he accented the words MAN MADE,  ENTERED THE EARTHS ATMOSPHERE AT THE TIME OF YOUR SIGHTING.” Then it dawned on me he was telling me what I needed to know.  He asked if there was anything further he could do, I said no and thanked him and we hung up.  What was this sighting.. Was it a small craft? Did it blow up or was it shot down?  We watched the molten metal falling, where was it from?   Why didn’t we hear anything?  It seemed a few mere miles away.. how far away was it?  Why didn’t someone else report this?  5/30/1998;44.9404510516251;-123.019728489483
