Walk to bus stop appromixtley 75yds from house.  Had a cigarette as always, then a smint(breath mint).  Was crystal clear night facing southeast I belive. viewed an object stalled in the sky no movement what so ever an thought geeese that's a huge star about the size of the tip of my pinky (ringsize 6) held close to my face nail towards me just breaking around the edge of my finger.  Then as I'm gazing in awe it takes an downward dive toward the sun sets from where it had been witch is just above a 75 to 80ft tall tree on the hill where i wait for my bus.  It had a curved blue tail made hum almost like when your turn up your record player to max volume an you here hum kinda sound.  an continued at same speed did not gain speed like meterors do it seemed to have a whiteish-blue tinge with a foggie haze around the sphere like when you hold a white shirt to a black lite.

Four large orange spherical objects with a diamond shape haloin long arc overhead.;2009-09-11 21:30:00;5 minutes;Four large orange spherical objects with a diamond shape halo in long arc overhead. Four objects were spotted overhead in sequence.  They faded as they moved from NW to SE and SW.  The objects were large and orange, larger than the space station appears.  They looked like large meteors, but did not follow typical trajectory.  One was followed by a small object that did look like a meteor.  The last object was particularly strange as we saw it through the tree line near the horizon and it then traveled overhead.  We have video of the fourth one, but it is shaky due to the zoom.  The entire event took about 5 minutes. The event occurred during a back yard gathering.  The witnesses (about a dozen) were mostly college professors and school teachers.  The object appeared to be a sphere surrounded by diamond.  Oddly, the sphere is clearly brighter on the back edge of its directions, contrary to what one would expect from atmospheric entry.  This was also the north side of the sphere two hours after sunset and was clear even at the western horizon, ruling out solar reflection. I am not suggesting that this is extraterrestrial, we simply cannot determine what it is.;44.9404510516251;-123.019728489483

Red pulsating sphere in OR- UFO?;2012-07-17 00:20:00;30 minutes;Red pulsating sphere in OR- UFO? As I was driving North-bound on I-5 from Salem to Portland, Oregon, I saw one red sphere object in the NWW sky around 12:20a 7/17/12.  It was pulsating red in moderate frequency.  It was too close to be a satelite but too far to be a telephone signal pole device- it was silimar to a plane but slightly larger and did not move. It did not have white or green lights on it. It was fairly high in the sky for most of the sighting (about 30 mins duration).  Towards the end of the sighting, it seemed to have lowered in altitude and gone slightly more westward.  The night was clear and the object appeared below the big dipper constellation.  It did not have noise to it nor did it have a trail.;44.9404510516251;-123.019728489483

5 orange glowing objects cruise by swimming pool in densely populated neighborhood of NE Salem.;2012-08-12 22:30:00;minute...minute and a hal;5 orange glowing objects cruise by swimming pool in densely populated neighborhood of NE Salem. At 10:30 PM Sunday evening the 12th of August my wife ((name deleted)) (48 yrs old) and myself (49)were in the 16 foot illuminated (underwater light) pool surrounded by darkness and stars in the back yard for a half hour or so when I noticed a glowing round orange object flying north to south just west of our property, less than quarter mile away at about 500 feet up (fairly low altitude in the densely populated neighborhood we live in North East Salem).   5 minutes later, from the north, 5 orange balls of silent traveling light could be seen traversing over the neighborhood between my street (Siesta) and the street to the west of ours (Bonanza) at about 20 to 30 miles per hour, traveling against a 5 to 10 mile per hour wind and rapidly approaching the airspace directly across from our pool.  During the approach my wife suddenly came to the realization this was not conventional aircraft, got spooked and insisted I get my glasses as she quickly got out of the pool.  I d! ashed to the kitchen door and retrieved by glasses and ran back to the edge of the pool, propping my arms up on the wood pile that lined the property line.  My wife was now standing behind me watching as the objects now slowly cruised by together, reminiscent Japanese lanterns but at a close enough vantage point to eliminate that possibility.  They also were clearly traveling together and independent of the wind so I quickly dismissed the possibility of such a man-made object.  The glowing balls of orange light, less than a quarter mile away and at about 500 feet briefly continued away from the pool to the left and each orange ball, one by one, imploded on itself disappearing one by one till all has disappeared from the sky. A couple of observations. I have been a student of the UFO phenomenon for over 25 years, spending the late 80’s and 90’s as a field investigator and assistant state director for MUFON and eventually helping establish Oregon UFO Research in 2000.  At the time of this event, the wife and I HAD JUST been discussing the subject of unidentified flying objects, and in particular I was in the middle of telling her about an incident in 1988 when I saw a low flying orange ball of light in my back yard in West Salem.  Almost immediately on the heels of telling her that story these balls of light appeared coming in over the homes along our street and heading our way and looking exactly like the object I had seen 23 years before.   I caught myself saying, You gotta be kidding me,  to my wife in light of just recalling to her the incident 23 years before. My gut feeling as I watched the orange glowing orbs or balls was that the flight was intentional, that they slowed as they passed us next to the pool and that we were being watched as we watched them, strong feeling.

Red lights floating east to west.;2013-06-15 22:30:00;~10 minutes;Red lights floating east to west There were eight red sphere like lights tracking west to east.  One seemed to have separated into multiple lights and fade out.  Only two of the lights made it out of city limits before fading out.  No zipping. Just floating, almost sailing across the sky. No boom from fireworks being launched, burning, or popping sounds.  They were completely silent. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Metallic sphere moving and changing directions.;2014-07-04 16:42:00;~24 minutes;metallic sphere moving and changing directions It looked like a white metallic ball to the north and it was heading to the south-east at a fairly good rate of speed.  After about 8 minutes it stopped and and moved in a jagged serpentine manner in that location for a few minutes. Then it continued on to the south-east until it was close to the area of the sky where the moon was located.  At that time it appeared to split into 2 separate spheres for maybe 20 seconds.  Then it began moving back to the north as one sphere. During the movement to the north, 2 separate jets went by heading to the south.  Both times the sphere disappeared for a second or two then reappeared on its same trajectory. When it got to about the same area that it was in when we first noticed it, it disappeared.;44.9404510516251;-123.019728489483

ORBS OVER SALEM OREGON MAY 2021;2021-05-19 21:45:00;ALL NIGHT;ORBS OVER SALEM OREGON MAY 2021 I have lived in Salem Oregon for the last five years almost exactly on the 45th parallel near Portland Rd & Lancaster Dr NE. On several occasions I witnessed various types of Unidentified Areal Phenomenon but never had a camera with me to document such sights. Often, I see these things after 9pm and later. On December 4, 2017 I saw a white sphere moving silently & slowly a couple hundred feet above me in a Southern Direction and as it moved higher into the atmosphere disappeared. I was awestruck because it was so close. On Wednesday evening, April 14, 2021, I stepped out onto my back porch so the dog could go out and was looking up at the stars in a Southern Direction from my home and saw some type of craft drop 3-4 orange spheres (one at a time) and as each one dropped it flew off & disappeared. I had never seen anything like that before and did not believe them to be flares as they vanished almost immediately. On Tuesday & Wednesday night, May 18 & 19, 2021, I was outside at various times both nights witnessing small white orbs dancing about in a playful manner, swirling around & racing each other back and forth through the clouds. Just when you would look at one, a slight flash of light would occur in another location flying about in the same manner. It did not matter which direction I looked toward East, West, South or North - there were I estimate hundreds (not clustered) of orbs at various heights and distances all over the sky. That Wednesday night (05/19/2021) around 9:30 I was standing in front of my house and saw a plane flying from North to South along the normal flight path over my home and saw another “craft” with just one solid light under it. It almost looked like a helicopter with a search beacon of some sort. The plane was much higher above this other craft with the very bright light headed just over my head and as they passed I couldn’t quite make out the type of a! irplane but thought it appears similar to the Stealth Bomber a triangular dark color but it went so fast I wasn’t clear what I was seeing. I saw my neighbor sitting in his car and rushed over to bang on his window to see what I was viewing. The airplane continued on its normal route and the craft with the light appeared to be speeding faster in an effort to catch up or pace the other plane when suddenly it veered on at an abnormal angle and disappeared. My neighbor thought both were airplanes, but I have never seen a plane fly at an angle such as this one did. To my amazement during the day on Thursday May 20, 2021 I saw the same orbs darting in & out of the clouds. It was shocking and somewhat difficult to see them with daylight present, but they were there. We had brief blue sky, some thunder/hail clouds, and some rain. I was able to document (as best I could) these orbs at various heights and directions around my home location. I did contact the National UFO Hotline and ! spoke briefly to Director Peter Davenport about what I thought! could b e ball lightning or some highly strange unidentified flying orbs. At his suggestion I make this report and have emailed him the videos I took. I am somewhat frightened now that the Men in Black might come visit me, lol. I believe these strange events witnessed are happening more and more frequently and an advocate of FULL Disclosure. CONFIDENTIAL NAME-SalemOR;44.9404510516251;-123.019728489483

I have attempted to catch them on video but not as successful as I would like. I am farsighted and can see these orbs flashing at times throughout the night in the clouds and definitely under cloud cover at lower altitude. I tried to call the hotline and my call dropped. Some of the spheres/orbs are brighter than others and I would estimate hundreds of them if not thousands flying about the entire sky.;44.9404510516251;-123.019728489483
Orbs over Salem OR;2021-05-27 23:00:00;All night;Orbs over Salem OR I live in NE Salem OR near the 45th parallel and for the last few weeks have observed orbs in the sky mostly after 9-9:30 pm and even in daylight if there are clouds present. I witness tem in every direction of the sky someimes flashing a light here and there and zig zagging in and out of the clouds individually and in groups. It is currently 12:30 am PST and to the West I see a larger orb lighted steadily releasing many tiny orbs that fly off in various directions and others flying with or around the larger orb which is mostly stationary or moving slowly. Mostly I see the smaller orbs each night. As mentioned I witness them in every direction and all hours of the night. I have attempted to video these sightings and not as successful as I would like. I have only reported these experiences on your website but thinking I should perhaps report to a news agency or law enforcement. I don’t want to be thought of as goofy and absolutely 100% certain what I am seeing is abnormal, unidentified aerial phenomenon and uncertain if these spherical beings/objects are friendly or threatening. I believe they are intelligent. They can appear and vanish suddenly. They often camouflage in the clouds and act as if they are harvesting energy from them as I witness them more ofyen when it is somewhat stormy. This larger orb releasing multiples is out in the open sky at this time. I have witnessed them moving about quite slowly and also with remarkable speed. I am amazed by these experiences and also somewhat frightened. I live alone and so I witness these events by myself. Every time I ask a neighbor to share the experience they behave as if I am losing my mind. I indeed am not. I will continue to report my sightings and this is my third report. I would like an investigator to contact me and in the mean time I will continue to obtain other witnesses and/or proof. Thank you.;44.9404510516251;-123.019728489483
