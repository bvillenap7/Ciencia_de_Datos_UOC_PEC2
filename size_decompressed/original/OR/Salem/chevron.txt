We were watching the thunderstorms on 8/21 when we spotted a boomerang shaped craft moving about three times the speed of other aircraft in the area flying right at the base of the clouds from the north to the south. It manuevered when it was overhead.the best way to describe the manuever was to say it appeared to 'slip sideways'off of its path then immediately resumed its original flight pattern.It glowed with a faint silver pink color,and was totally silent in operation. It appeared to loosely follow the I-5 freeway. we are located just to the east of the I-5. There is also an airport 3-4 miles southwest of our location. this was definitely not a conventional aircraft.;44.9404510516251;-123.019728489483

At 2205 I saw a bright flash of light to the NW of me and a few moments later I noticed I couldnt hear the I-5 freeway....I also noticed sounds much closer to me were muffled...Im not sure how long this lasted.after sounds returned at 2305 coming from the North I noticed a diffuse pink glow. As it got closer I noticed what appeared to be a wing shaped object with four cylindrical attachments on it that ran the length of the object..and a little longer...these were odd looking as they didnt seem to fit in with the object I was seeing..the object was smooth lined and rounded the cylinders were wrinkly in appearance. The object was lit really softly..it was very hard to see until it was right overhead..it sounded like wind rustling through the leaves. It moved from due north to south..and was approx.300-500 ft above ground...or it was way bigger than I thought..I was about the width of a quarter held at arms length.At 2315 a formation of three military helicopters came from due south moving north approximating this objects attitude..these were really low to the ground..about 200 ft altitude;44.9404510516251;-123.019728489483

I am not familar with the exact height/Locations of things>  According to the actual flight standerds>, but it was traveling at a fast pace.  It was an orange cheveron shape flying East to west at a fast rate... Meaning faster than any normal craft. I'm certainly not sure if it was a new technoligy or not, But yet again I have a hard time understanding just how an craft from this planet could could go so very fast without gravity damage.

Vague chevron object with strange colored lights and erratic movement seen, with smaller lights/objects emitted from it as it traveled.;2009-06-17 22:00:00;10 minutes;Vague chevron object with strange colored lights and erratic movement seen, with smaller lights/objects emitted from it as it traveled. I was looking up at the stars, which I could see clearly (this tends to be unusual with our normally cloudy skies), and I suddenly saw a bright starlike light (white with reddish around edges)which faded quickly as it moved slow about 2 inches toward the north. I thought this was a shooting star or something. Then another bright starlike light shone to just the east of it, but this one started shooting around wildly like a binball machine, erratic and quickly with no discernable pattern and at extreme angles, but completely unlike a plane possibly could, within about a 5 in radius (from my perspective). Then this light headed southward at a more steady pace, and as it went I could see several lights blinking quickly in different colors - red, white, blue, green - but these lights blinked randomly and all around a two inch-long object that I could just vaguely see (It seemed very high up). At one point they almost seemed to light up rapidly in a 'band' across the width of the object. It looked slightly grey against the deep blue sky, and it appeared to have an elongated point at it's head and possibly two shorter points at its end with a concave bottom - possibly chevron shaped (it may have had more points to it, but it was very unclear). All the blinking lights were no bigger than most of the stars around the sky. As it headed south overhead it traveled about the speed of a plane way high up, but it kept blinking these colored lights in a random effect all over the face of it. Then smaller white lights began shooting away from it one & two at a time in all directions, going away up to about 5-6 inches. It still had a main white light, brighter than the rest, which continued to blink at erratic but consistent intervals. We watched it do this until it was very far south, to the distant tree line. Small lights continually came off from it, although they were very hard to see once it had reached that far away. About 10 minutes later, the lights of what looked to be a regular airplane, with one white light & one red flashing at regular & consistent intervals, crossed the sky in the same path and disappeared at the same point beyond the trees.;44.9404510516251;-123.019728489483

Craft was north east of my location. It seemed to be illuminated white or pale yellow however the light was faint, possibly obstructed by clouds.  Craft was moving in the direction of the point of the chevron. Craft faded quickly after being visible for about 10 seconds;44.9404510516251;-123.019728489483
