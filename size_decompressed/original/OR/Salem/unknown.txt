Missing Time July 31, 1997;1997-07-31 02:45:00;unknown;Missing Time July 31, 1997  It happened on July 31, 1997  I had seen something a few days earlier when I was in the backyard and called mom and told her about it, sometime the next morning several others saw the same UFO I did but they made a official report and were talking about it on Art Bell and it made the papers.. I had seen the UFO heading south toward California and it was seen by the others over Medford near the California border, later that same morning. After this sighting when I heard others talking about it on the radio and read about it in the paper, I decided to call Peter Davenport,at the National UFO Reporting Center in Seattle, Peter had been up most all night taking reports with all the sightings in Medford and was very tired and did not have time to take the report, or at least this is what I believe that he said.  I took it personally and thought I would never call Peter again (not Peters’ fault, just my own judgment of the situation. I was helping out a friend in a small store here and told her about it and was still smarting at how Peter had treated me, or I thought he had treated me, and told her about that too. Anyway I was home watching TV, my husband was about to go to bed, he is needs lots of sleep.. he reminded me to lock the back door and put the stick in it.. that way if the cats get ancy we can open the patio door, put a stick in it and let them go in and out at will... anyway I said I would, and did, and he went to bed and I lay down on the couch and was out like a light, fully dressed/shoes too The next thing I remember was waking up and seeing it was time to feed the cats, it was about 7AM.. my husband was in his computer room and the back door was open, the stick had been removed, I got up, fed cats and my husband and was relaxing watching TV news with my second cup of coffee, when the phone rang and it was <former boss>, she was calling me to see if I was alright, and to ask me about the lights, I said you mean the ones I saw the other night? She said NO the ones you saw this morning.. I said I did not see any lights this morning and she said Yes you did, she again said are you OK?   I said YES I was fine, why wouldn't I be.. she said after your call this morning about the lights, I said what call, she said the one you made to me early this morning, she said you left me a message.. I wanted to hear it but she had erased it not thinking about it, but had listened to the message numerous times and had written it down verbatim' and signed the paper.. this is what she said the message said... (my remarks)  <name>, this is CK, I'm really sorry to call you at this time, it is 2:40 AM, in the morning, I am out by North Salem High School ( this is about 3 miles from my home) and I have been watching a bright light in the sky for about 45 minutes. If you know Peter Davenports number or one who does that sort of thing down here (In Salem) they need to be called. I am looking south and a little east and the large light is very bright, too big to be a star. There are 3 smaller lights in a line down one side and I can see two in a line down the other side, but there may be a third one, I can't see from here. It hasn't moved. If you know who investigates these please call them and tell them the information because there is no way this is stars.. End of recording/message.. I told <name> that she was kidding, right? she said No I swear its true  I asked her where I called from, she said she did not know, but that when I was done I did not say goodbye or anything, the line just went totally blank/dead, and it had a empty tinny sound. I called my husband into the living room and asked him when he took the stick out of the patio door? He said I thought you did, the door was open when I got up about 6:00 AM.. I ran to the front door, and it was closed but unlocked, it had been locked and a separate latch used, that was also open.. then I went into the driveway, scared of what I would find, and there was my car, parked on the opposite side of the driveway than I usually park.. I was terrified.. Where had I been, what had I done?  I asked my husband did you get up to go to the bathroom last night? He is usually up 2-3 times a night, NO he said for some reason he had not awakened till just before he got up.. I grabbed my purse and drove over to the high school, I got out of the car near the football field and walked over to the fence surrounding the field, trying to remember what I might have seen, did anything trigger a memory, and all that happened was that I got very dizzy, but walked around looking for some clue as to what had happened.. I remember looking for a tan shingled roof I had been standing near and wanted to check that out on the letter from <name>and was very surprised to see she/I had not mentioned any such roof or color of shingles in the message so it must have been a memory of the event..the only one I have had of that night. I am fortunate to know a lot of UFO researchers and I immediately called my old friend Dr Leo Sprinkle who works with abductees, some researchers or psychologists make the event scary, but if Dr Sprinkle does the same interview the abduction becomes a positive experience not a negative one, a learning experience. I was terrified about what could have happened... what if I would have had a car accident? a flat tire? How would I explain being out driving alone at 2:40 AM?   Dr Sprinkle pointed out that I was likely totally alert and in control till I got home and that is when they took remove any  memory of what happened.. This still haunts me and I still check the doors several times during the evening hours to be sure they are locked. For over a year I had slept fully dressed in a sweat suit complete with shoes etc. Note: Peter is always open and willing to listen to urgent reports. I just took his being tired personally and that was my problem, not Peters’ short coming.  CK 7/31/97;44.9404510516251;-123.019728489483

Slow moving, horizontally flying object.;2000-07-11 00:30:00;5-8 sec.;Slow moving, horizontally flying object. While driving North on Interstate-5, I saw what looked at first like an airplaine or helicopter flying horizontally at a somewhat slow speed and very low altitude, but when I looked direcly at it I saw what looked more like a meteor flying horizontally no more than 200-300 feet off the ground and much too slow to have been a meteor.  I shouted to my brother who was in the front passenger seat of my car to look and he saw the object as well. It appeared to loose altitude then suddenly vanished.  The object was visible by me for about 5-8 seconds, but could have been there for longer, since I only noticed it after having passed a tall,dense group of trees.  If anyone has any information, please contact me.  Thank You.;44.9404510516251;-123.019728489483
Salem OR, slow moving lights at midnight and 2 hours later heard noise but nothing spotted;2003-08-31 02:00:00;30 MIN?;Salem OR, slow moving lights at midnight and 2 hours later heard noise but nothing spotted I woke up at 2:00am because I heard what sounded like a type of soft odd music - varios notes without relation to each other and not really notes that I could identify.  It came from outside my bedroom window which overlooks the driveway the window was open.  It lasted for just a couple of seconds once I awoke and seemed to fade out but at the same time a long drawn out buzzing started.  It was more similar to a musical note than a mechanical buzzing - the buzzing tone you hear from a tuning fork as it rings in your ears.  It was moving around outside and I thought perhaps a street sweeper was out there but there were no other noises, just the buzzing hum.  No engines, no radio, nothing else.  My dog was under the covers shivering which is very unlike her.  She is a terrier and usually has no fear just growls or barks at all night noises.  I got up to look out the window but saw nothing on the ground or in the sky.  I still heard the odd humming noise that was moving around in the distance.  It would fade out and become louder.  It stopped for a couple of minutes and then started again and finally quit altogether.  When I told my parents about it the next morning, my mother (a no-nonsense midwesterner) said she had seen some odd lights that night.  It was about midnight and she couldn't sleep so she went into the darkened living room.  She looked out the window which faces north and saw some lights in the far distance in the Northeast that were just over the horizon.  She went to get a glass of water and came back and they had not moved.  As she watched the lights, they moved a slight bit to the east and then back.  They moved very slowly and she thought she saw red & green lights like the landing gear of a plane but when she got the binoculars, she noticed more colors of lights.  The object seemed to be moving farther away but very slowly.  She watched the object for about 10-15minutes before it was gone.;44.9404510516251;-123.019728489483
Lights moving from south to north, low to ground and slow without any sound.;2007-01-01 19:30:00;15-20 seconds;Lights moving from south to north, low to ground and slow without any sound. The event happened on January 1st, 2007.  It was an exceptionally dark night usually there is some minimal light pollution out in all directions from my house, but it seemed much lesser that night in retrospect.  I was doing work as I generally do at that time of night with my window blinds up, as I like to see the sky.  It happened to be a very nice, clear night out without any clouds.  While working away, I noticed out of the corner of my right eye, to the south, something with lights in the sky.  I glanced at it and realized that it wasn't either an airplane or helicopter.  As it was so dark that night, I was unable to make out any shape of the object.  It was emitting absolutely no sound, which is the first thing that struck me as strange.  The object was very low to the ground, far too low for a fixed-wing or rotary-wing aircraft by my best estimation, somewhere between 100-150 feet from the ground.  The object had four lights that I could see two in the front and the other two swept out to the sides and back a bit.  All four of the lights seemed to be emitting a light that looked color-wise to a warm flourescent light, but emitted light as strong and as clear as an industrial bulb would.  I would also like to note that these lights did not seem to shine any light down onto the ground, even from the low altitude.  The object was moving at a quite slow, steady pace, estimated at about 20-30 MPH.  It moved from south to north without stopping, changing course or speed as far as I watched.  Had I been in my senses, I would have jumped up and ran to the front door I was, however, stunned at what I had just witnessed, wondering if it could have been something ordinary.  I believe it was not, however, due to the facts that a) I saw no landing lights or blinking lights on the craft, and b) There is no landing strip and/or airport north of my house the nearest one is about three miles south-east.;44.9404510516251;-123.019728489483
Formation of glowing red objects;2014-01-31 18:36:00;35 seconds;Formation of glowing red objects I was approaching Front Street coming from the north east, coming up to the stop sign and prepare to turn right I had spotted something odd in the sky to the south.  I take my right turn and grab my phone while keeping an eye on what these objects could be.  Front St runs parallel with the Willamette river and along waterfront Park and Marion Street bridge spanning across the river to West Salem.  I started up my video recorder on my phone and was approaching the overhang of the bridge so I discounted the idea that these objects weren't attached to the bridge.  After coming from under the bridge that was when I was able to get a clear and unobstructed view.  These objects were solid red in color and never changed to any other color, just a constant red, I counted at least 10 of these objects all within a loose cluster, they weren't too far from one another and they appeared to be in what I can remember was a zig zag formation, like the letter Z.  At that time I ! was approaching a stop light and was basically right under the formation of these objects.  I was stopped in my vehicle and studying these objects and as I was looking directly at them the upper part of these objects broke formation and slowly started towards the south with the bottom half heading in all different directions, so five broke south and the other five went in random directions.  What shocked me the most was when I witnessed these things break formation none of them made any sounds whatsoever.  I went back to the video I had recorded after I got back to my place of employment and watched it frame by frame and  was able to capture a few screenshots of my siting.;44.9404510516251;-123.019728489483
Multiple objects with blinking lights moving around in a strange way for the past hour and half;2014-09-05 23:00:00;90 minutes;multiple objects with blinking lights moving around in a strange way for the past hour and half For the past hour and a half we have witnessed multiple objects in different directions of the sky. They had bright flashing lights and seemed to be moving in very odd sequence. They kinda swayed back and forth and slowly moved farther away. We witnessed one that moved from the west to the northwest and in the past hour has moved back to the west but the entire time it was kinda swaying and dipping down for a bit and then a little while later it went back up. Did this same kinda movement all the way to the north  sky and back. We witnessed  two more to the south and one to the northeast. These objects are all moving the same way and are still in the sky at the time of this report;44.9404510516251;-123.019728489483
An object was spotted hovering far to the SE of Salem with multicolored star-like lights that flashed randomly in a triangular shape.;2014-09-28 02:38:00;67 minutes;An object was spotted hovering far to the SE of Salem with multicolored star-like lights that flashed randomly in a triangular shape. Object was viewed and captured on camera phone SE of witness' location hovering above trees south of  Downtown Salem, Oregon, at approximately 2:40 AM, lasting until about 3:45. The object appeared to be  large and far away, but the witness is unsure just how big and how far away the craft was.  The witness  observes that it could be a few football fields in size about 10 miles away or could be 20 miles across, the witness had no way to tell for sure as the visibility was slightly hazy with city light pollution, no stars  were visible, it was not cloudy.  The object hovered, but moved about a central area, bobbing and wobbling. The object appeared  triangle in shape due to flickering and flashing, multicolored star-like lights that followed no noticeable  timed intervals or which star-like light would flicker or flash.  There were also multicolored star-like  lights flashing around the object that did not appear to be attached to it..  The witness describes that  this looks very similar in behavior to one the witness had spotted multiple times but facing north,  intermittently over the previous six to eight months and much farther away from the observer.;44.9404510516251;-123.019728489483
3 bright dots Salem.;2014-10-10 22:50:00;3 minutes;3 bright dots Salem To the West of downtown Salem, OR. Noted two red dots in the sky, traveling Northeast at a constant rate of speed.  Both maintained a consistent path and velocity, based upon distance between.   Approx 1min into observation, a third dot appeared roughly halfway between two red dots, but further west.  Assumed same path and trajectory, quickly falling into parallel line.   All 3 lights increased brightness, then vanished.

Swarm of bees sound.;2017-11-18 16:30:00;5 seconds;swarm of bees sound I heard a buzzing sound like a swarm of bees and was looking up into the sky.  I caught a glimpse of the craft moving sideways and tail lights that were red and aqua blue set into the craft just like an automobile.  It was heading west and disappeared into the clouds.;44.9404510516251;-123.019728489483

(Silent, Slow moving, High-Altitude Aircraft: flashing Red/Green Marker Lights). Aircraft (to the South-West) at High Altitude, in Southern Sky, slowly moving Northbound. Silent --No Sound/Noise. Extreme, Very Bright, High-Intensity White light(s).  Extreme Bright Lights,  Way out of the Ordinary.  (Many times brighter than Moon, Planets, Star, or any ordinary Commercial Aircraft).  Multiple lights formed a short vertical line (length or aircraft?) for 30 min. or more.  I have never seen anything so incredibly Intense, like it before (especially from so great a distance/altitude).  Aircraft changed direction/Altitude? causing White line of Lights to merge into a single bright Spot (approx. 5 min).  Then Aircraft turned to the South (180 degrees), causing bright White light to disappear.  Bright white light was replaced with Flashing Red/Green Marker lights of an Aircraft.  Aircraft went south for 10 min. then turned 180 Degrees and headed North again.  Bright white Spot light re-appeared again, but not as intense (approx. 10 min.).  Then, Turned South Again, showing Red/Green Marker Lights. Aircraft continued Traveling further South, disappearing into Southern Sky.;44.9404510516251;-123.019728489483

I was walking and out of the corner of my eye I see these 3 red dots in the air. They were slow moving and no sound. They just disappeared.

We were at the Oregon State Fair and noticed some shapes to the north. We thought they may be balloons or sky divers. As we watched the objects move to the west, they changed formations. They were random formations at first and then moved into lines, a circle, and then into an arrow (two connecting lines) before disappearing in the west.;44.9404510516251;-123.019728489483
