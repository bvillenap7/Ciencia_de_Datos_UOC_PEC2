10 orange orbs 1/2-1 mile above on Morningside Dr SE/13th Street SE Salem, OR 9:00 pm - 9:07pm in a file, banked to right, slow vanish;2015-03-21 21:00:00;7 minutes;10 orange orbs 1/2-1 mile above on Morningside Dr SE/13th Street SE Salem, OR 9:00 pm - 9:07pm in a file, banked to right, slow vanish I went to the top of a street 1313 Morningside Dr SE, Salem, OR, 97302, and as I  turned right onto a short drive called 13th Street SE going towards Hillendale, I pulled over to observe an orange illuminated orb about 1/2 - mile in slow movement, over the trees coming from the west to east in a straight line.  It was incredibly close.   Then it took a right angle turn going south just about in front of me and began to get dimmer and dimmer with the glow turning more into embers or slight flares and then I could see its outline continuing southward and upward but without light of any kind, just fading into the night sky, but could see the outline for many seconds, without the orange, and the outline did not appear to be round, like the orb was.  Then this exact thing happened again, and again, and again, up to 10 times.  The 3rd one seemed to try to catch up to the 2 in front and sped up a bit, it also seemed larger, and it slightly veered further straight before it took its right angle turn.  Each one had the basic same protocols.  I could not see where they came from because they would come over a tree top to the west of this small tiny street about the size of 3 houses.  In all it was 7 minutes.  I waited about 10 minutes to see if any more came, and none did.  One seemed to stop a short while, or slowed way down before it banked right.   I am not technical, I have an old fashioned cell, and I don't know how to take pics.  Now I should learn.  And did not have your ph # with me, but now I will.;44.9404510516251;-123.019728489483
Something huge just fell towards Earth.;2015-09-21 00:30:00;1 second;Something huge just fell towards Earth. I was sitting outside on my back porch.  I caught a light out of the corner of my eye.  It was huge.  I thought it was a shooting star.  But it was huge, and got closer to earth than anything I've seen before of that nature.  And it wasn't as fast like I have seen them before.   It was bright pale yellow at first then turned a light blue as it got closer to the ground, it had a smoke trail behind it.  I thought it would have burned up but it didn't and I could continue to see it until it was out of sight and behind the trees in my line of vision.   I've never seen anything like it.  I'm actually scared right now.  It lit up the sky and I thought I was going to feel it hit.  But I felt nothing.  I'm shaking right now.  I've never seen anything like it before.;44.9404510516251;-123.019728489483
4 identical reddish orange orbs moving silently NE to SW across the sky before slowly disappearing.;2015-11-25 22:30:00;5 minutes;4 identical reddish orange orbs moving silently NE to SW across the sky before slowly disappearing. I was walking the dog and noticed one reddish orange orb moving at a steady pace, but not fast.  At first it appeared to be a plane on fire however it continued to travel across the sky going northeast to southwest. There were no flashing lights or tail, which may indicate a plane or meteor. As It moved across the sky it appeared as if it were a Chinese lantern but it was too big for that and higher in the sky, yet lower than a jet that was also flying in the area. Because I was walking the dog, and wanted a witness, I started to jog home to alert my wife and son.  Before I reached the house it had slowly disappeared.  By the time I got to the driveway there were three more following the same path. My son came outside and we observed them as they flew by.  They seemed close enough that we should have been able to hear engine noise, but they were completely silent. Each object slowly disappeared into the night sky.  It took ~45 seconds to 1 minute for each object to cross the sky from the northeast and disappear while travelling in a southwesterly direction.

Break away size-shifting balls of light dance around trees.;2017-11-19 20:33:00;90 seconds;Break away size-shifting balls of light dance around trees. What first appeared as two orange/amber street lights, two objects started to increase in height up to about 50 ft pulsating in brightness and changing in shape from what appeared to be similar to softball size all the way up to 6 foot in diameter.  They we're dancing around a tree like neurons or protons do so around a nucleus of an atom.  Movements didn't appear to follow wind patterns, there was no sound and appeared to move with intelligence changing direction and speed gracefully and swiftly.  They increased speed very rapidly heading North towards Portland at the same time as they dimmed down and disappeared as fast as they showed.;44.9404510516251;-123.019728489483
