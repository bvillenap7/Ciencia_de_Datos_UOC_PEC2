Red and white light flying erratically and very fast;2015-09-22 22:55:00;5 minutes;Red and white light flying erratically and very fast Saw a sphere of light which randomly oscillated between red and white with no apparent pattern or timing.  It was difficult to tell whether it was small and close to me (1/4 mile) or large and very far away.   It hovered in place for 10 to 15 seconds, then descended in a very rapid spiral pattern almost to the horizon.  It then immediately zoomed back up to its original altitude, where it proceeded to move in random figure-eight patterns, gaining and losing altitude rapidly.  It moved very quickly - approximately the same speed as someone playing with a laser pointer (except I saw no beam and it was larger than the point of a laser).   It continued its dance for about 4 to 5 minutes until it disappeared behind some trees in the distance. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length via telephone with the witness, and we found him to be exceptionally eloquent and objective, in his description of the sighting.  We suspect that he is a very good witness.  PD));43.097;-124.4049
