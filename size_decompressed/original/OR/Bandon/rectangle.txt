oregon coast rectangle football field sized white square lights;1984-06-01 21:00:00;5;oregon coast rectangle football field sized white square lights Me and a freind where looking out our parked car window at about 9 PM. We both noticed what seemed to be a star moving from north to south.We got out to look it approached very quickly and then slowed to what seemed like a few mph.We saw 2 vertical square white lights approx. 100 feet above us.As the obect passed over us the vertical lights went out of view and we could see a set of horizontal white lights.Then a set of blue square lights swept back at not quite a 45 degree angle.Then another set of white lights.All of the lights where non radiant but bright and solid.As far as i could tell the object was about the size of a football field.It moved from then north to south southeast.As soon as it had passed over us it appeared as a star and quickly moved over the horizon.It made a slight humming noise.The night was very clear and dark stars where extremely visible. I recently talked to someone who gave the same description of an object during the same time period but in broad daylight within a mile of my sighting.The only difference was that he and the person with him heard the obejct.I had never told anyone of my sighting so i was shocked to hear another account.
