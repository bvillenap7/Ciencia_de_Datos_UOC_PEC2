Isn't a planet because of the shape and spires and time of night and year.  Not a plane because it doesn't move, and there are no airplane routes over Bandon going east to west. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) I'm looking east.  I don't know angle or height.  Maybe over 14k feet up.  It disappeared around 10:30 pm last night. ((END ADDENDUM));43.097;-124.4049
