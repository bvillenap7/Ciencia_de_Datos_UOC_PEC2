I ran for the camera in the kitchen and came out onto the back porch. I managed to film it for a minute or so before the neighbor and his dog came out downstairs and I was only wearing a night shirt so I ended the video and ran inside. I peeked out the front door to see if it was still flying away and it was getting dimmer and headed NE. It was sighted around 9:35 pm.  I videoed the object and the moon was coming up behind the small patch of forest next to the field, which I have under the object for size reference. ! Lots of dogs are barking in the neighborhood.  Around 9:44pm we heard another noise like the one earlier, and at around ten minutes later noticed a cop car driving down the little dirt road next to the big empty field behind our apt complex.  The cop had his spotlight on looking around and I'm guessing he was called to find out what that sound was. Feeling spooked and want to keep my eye out for anything else. I'm not sure what it was but I would love to see that video super close up and figure out what it was!;43.097;-124.4049
