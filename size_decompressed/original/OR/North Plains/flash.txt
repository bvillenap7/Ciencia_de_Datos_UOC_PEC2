Flash in the sky;2020-07-03 20:30:00;3-4 seconds;Flash in the sky We were driving across highways around north plains OR and 3 of us saw a medium sized flash above the trees slightly in the sky. It lit up the sky for a second and flew away in an instant as if it was going hyperspace from a movie and we couldnâ€™t see it after a split second.;45.6699;-123.0303
