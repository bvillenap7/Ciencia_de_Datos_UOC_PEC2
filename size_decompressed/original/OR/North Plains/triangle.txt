Uplit triangular craft displaying spectrum of color over Hwy 26.;2014-08-23 21:40:00;30 seconds;Uplit triangular craft displaying spectrum of color over Hwy 26. I was traveling west on Highway 26 at 9:40 PST.  The sighting occurred between the Jackson School Road exit and North Plains exit.  I saw a bright golden light on horizon to the NW, over Pumpkin Ridge.  I thought it was a planet due to position and quality of light, maybe Venus.  As I continued to watch, the light began to move and then change color from gold to Orange to red through the spectrum very smoothly, like a gradient.   The object moved unlike any aircraft I've seen, very fast and smooth with no blinking lights.  It moved South very quickly, close enough to the highway that I could see it was an uplit, triangular object.  As I tried to comprehend what I was seeing, as well as keep the car on the road, it disappeared.  The entire episode lasted less than a minute.   I am a woman in her early 20s, working in the service industry.;45.6699;-123.0303
