I watched it thinking it was a very slow moving plane at first, then I noticed the wobble, moving north to south, or away from me to towards me.it was then that I realised that it was moving very slow, because of the distance bieng so close I guessed the speed to be about 5 MPH.I started looking real close at this time and I saw no wings no tail and no windows, it moved from left to right very slowly wabeling the intire time, it then moved behind some tree's and I walked over to get a better view and when I got to a place where I should have seen it, it was gone.I then went to work (my workplace bieng only across the street and talked with a co-worker, he has lived in north plains for 20+ years and is a pilet that owns his own plane. I asked bill if anyone ownes any blimps or such an aircraft that fit the discription that I have previosly given by any strech of his imagination.he said no, and I asked him where the local airports are and they are south from our location. I am a machinist and have been for the last three and one half years.;45.6699;-123.0303
