Daylight disc enters valley behind my rural home.;2015-06-14 12:30:00;2 minutes;Daylight disc enters valley behind my rural home. This last Saturday (sic.  Sunday), my roommate started frantically yelling for me to come outside and look up in the sky..  That's when I saw the the flying saucer..  It had moved into the valley right behind my house!   I called for the others to come out and we all watched as it hovered for a while, wobbling on it's axis..  Then it banked hard at 40 deg's and dropped altitudeâ€¦  If I had to guess, I'd say it reduced it's altitude from 150 ft to maybe 65 ft before I lost it behind some tall tree's..   We only got 1 pic of it before the camera decided to turn off..  We live in a very rural area on Pumpkin Ridge, in North Plains..   It looked like it was heading up the Ridge so I jumped in the car and decided to try to chase it down.. but I never got it back into view..;45.6699;-123.0303

My roommate ran in the house and told me to come outside quick and look at this object in the sky.   I came running out and I seen a disk shaped object, looking grey, it was slowly moving crossed the horizon, much slower then a plane would move.  It did not have any lights on it or any other noticeable features.  I could not see any wings or propulsion device.  It kept moving until it went behind some tree's and I could not see it any more.   My girlfriend and two other roommates saw this and one of my roommates got a picture of it.  My son also saw it.;45.6699;-123.0303
