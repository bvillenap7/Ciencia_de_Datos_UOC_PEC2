Bright lights at night in the desert that hovered over the road, then sped away.;1996-05-01 01:30:00;15 minutes;Summary : Bright lights at night in the desert that hovered over the road, then sped away. We were visiting at a ranch in Catlow Valley, OR approx. 45 north of the Nevada border.  I woke up and found that my fiance was sitting at the table in our travel trailer. I called out to him and he told me to come here, quickly.  When I got to where he was, I saw bright lights out by the road, coming towards the meadow.  They were approx. 1/4 mile away.  We watched as they hovered about 20' above the road and moved back and forth across the road.  This is desert area and the nearest house is about 4 miles to the north. This object was coming from the north east direction, moving somewhat south west.  When it reached the bottom of the meadow, it turned, raised in the air slightly and headed due west straight across the desert.  It was very bright and moving quickly.  In a matter of minutes, it covered at least 10 miles and then just disappeared.  The object appeared to be very large in size -- maybe 30' tall or more and about 20' across.  It was almost triangle shaped, with lights along the bottom, on the sides and on the top.  Where the object was spotted, there is nothing but sagebrush and there is no chance that it was any type of vehicle known to us.  There is no road out that way, no people, no houses, etc.  After the object was gone, my finace confessed to me that he saw something similar to that the previous year when he was at this same ranch helping with the haying, but he didn't tell me because he was the only one to see it and didn't think I would believe him. straight across the desert.  I watched until it was about a mile out in the desert and I could still see it clearly, then, all of a sudden, it tilted upward slightly and was gone.;43.5146;-119.0524
