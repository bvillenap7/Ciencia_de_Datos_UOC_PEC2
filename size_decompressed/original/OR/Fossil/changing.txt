The lights were on the outer perimeter of the sometimes round saucer shaped object.  The lights were rotating from left to right for a while, and then started seeming to tilt on to its edge u passenger agreed it looked as if it were the same as my observation.   We were in the farm land where wheat is grown nowhere where any cities ore towns were located.  due to the strangeness of what were seek were swing, I told my passenger that I wanted to go down a old farm road where we both figured it was, and my pasenger got freaked out an told me he didn't want to go there.  The night was completely clear, with only the stars shining brightly.   We arrived at our campground approximately five hours later than we should have.  I don't know where the time went.  It was opening day hunting season and since we were so late getting there, we decided to go ahead and do some hunting and I got a four point buck by 12 o'clock noon this day.   We went back to camp, skinks the buck, ate early dinner and went to bed.  We got up and hunted until 12 noon, packed up camp and left for home since we both had to go to work on Monday.  We stopped in the town of Fossil to get snacks is when we found out at the store it was in fact Tuesday.   When arriving at home the entire family had called the police and were to file a missing persons report.  They cancelled the search.
