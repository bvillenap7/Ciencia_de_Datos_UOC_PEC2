Orange light in night sky dropping smaller light.;2014-03-10 20:15:00;5-10 minutes;Orange light in night sky dropping smaller light Single orangish light traveling south east. appeared to be moving no faster than airplanes seen flying over.  At one point a smaller orangish light fell from the bottom.  Looked like an ember falling from a flame (this is for descriptive purposes to describe the falling smaller light. the original orangish light was not on fire that I could tell).   It continued its course until it either disappeared or simply moved too far outside my visual range. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

VERY LOUD ROARING SOUND I WAS OUTSIDE IN MY DRIVEWAY WATCHING A LIGHTNING STORM.  I HAPPENED TO NOTICE TWO GLOWING RED OBJECTS COMING FROM THE NORTH TRAVLING SOUTH AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED OVER THE TOP OF MY HOUSE.  ONE OF THE OBJECTS DISAPPEARED AND THE OTHER VEARED OFF TOWARDS THE SOUTH EAST.   AS THE OBJECT PASSED OVER IT APPEARED TO BE A FUZZY RED GLOW AND MADE A VERY LOUD ROARING SOUND.   LIGHTING WAS FLASHING AT THE TIME BUT NO THUNDER.  I WAS STILL ABLE TO HEAR THE ROARING SOUND FOR APPROX. 6 SECONDS AFTER  THE OBJECT WENT OUT OF MY VIEW. I AM A 56 YEAR OLD HOUSEWIFE.  MY HUSBAND LISTENS TO COAST RADIO AND TOLD ME ABOUT THE REPORT FROM COOS BAY ON JULY 31, 2014 AT APPROX. THE SAME TIME I HAD MY SIGHTING, SO I THOUGHT IT WAS WORTH GIVING MY REPORT.
