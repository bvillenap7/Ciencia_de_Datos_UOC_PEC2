White lights.;2015-11-17 05:27:00;1 hour;White lights I went  outside to smoke a cigarette with my friend, when I noticed the stars seemed to be  coming out.  The first individual star I noticed that seem to be different at first, looked like a normal star, it seemed to be getting bigger and bigger, with what seemed to be moving a bit side to side, then slowly disappeared as the blinking began getting smaller.   We took like 15 minutes and decided to walk to his house.  As we walked towards his house we looked up and saw what seemed to be a line of about four of these same lights.  They were desicised in the stars, but we're larger more vibrent lights that within the next 8 minutes did the same odd flashing and disappearing activity.;43.3902;-123.2947
