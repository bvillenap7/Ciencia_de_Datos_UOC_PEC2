Orange satillite enlarges 5 times its size as it flairs to white-blue, then back to original size and color .;2001-08-02 23:21:00;3min;Orange satillite enlarges 5 times its size as it flairs to white-blue, then back to original size and color . I was out side looking at the new full moon with binoculars when I saw an orange light moving above me.At arms lenght it was the size of a pin head or just larger than a star.Moving south to north on the 10 degree radial.I wathced it for a moment cause it was orange and not white like other satillites.As it came dierectly over my head it changed.It started to flair white-blue color and increase 5 times in size.This only lasted for 3 seconds (appox.) and then whent back to its previous size and color.Never stopping or chanig course I followed it till it dissapeared  beneath the Northern horizen.Checked my watch again,the whole event lasted appox.3 min. . ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness means a date of August 02, 2001, and we have changed it here.  Also, he may have been witness to the characteristic flare, caused by an Iridium satellite.  Please see other report for the same date and approximate time.  We believe the location is Hillsboro, OR we are not aware of a Hillboro.  We have amended the name of the city.

Daytime High speed orb caugt on video;2004-06-24 14:00:00;1 second;Daytime High speed orb caugt on video On June 26, 2004 while observing some persistant contrails me and my wife observed some high altitude stationary orbs which I photographed with my sony mavica 300. While I tried to snap some stills I ran in to grab my video camera which I put on a tripod and just filmed in the direction that we spotted the orbs. In reviewing the video there is two very visable white orbs that appear from the trail and then accelerate at an unbelievable rate of speed. The video has trees in the background, has birds that fly in the blurfo and one lense refraction. The orbs are none of these and the video is amazing as it shows it pop up out of the trail and then make a right angle exit that defies belief.;45.5248370535713;-122.961403125001
