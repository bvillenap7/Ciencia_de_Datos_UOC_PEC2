triangular object(s) coasted through Oregon and Washington.;2001-09-30 17:26:00;17:56;triangular object(s) coasted through Oregon and Washington. I was on my back deck with my 2 daughters in Hillsboro, Oregon when I viewed what looked like a bundle of balloons floating from the Southeast sky.  I told my daughters and wife to come look at the large balloons floating away.  Upon closer inspection,  I noticed that they didn't look like balloons but rather a bright triangular shaped object with rounded areas on each angle rotating on an axis.  I watched the object for half an hour before it was out of my view.  The course it took was from my East to what appeared to be above the oregon coast at West where it separated into 2 objects and then the 2 objects turned North then Northeast and kept getting a little higher and farther as they disappeared from my view probably above central Washington state.;45.5248370535713;-122.961403125001
fire in the sky;2002-07-12 22:00:00;10 minutes;fire in the sky it was pretty much just a bright star-looking light shining right above some trees.  it slowly got dimmer and dimmer until you couldn't see it any more until it suddenly grew brighter and bigger very quickly.  it turned a sort of reddish-yellow.  basically like a big flame in the sky.  it initially took on the shape of a cylindar, but then became more like a cresent moon, as if implying a sphere.  After a few minutes at this intesity, it again grew dimmer until it was lost from sight.  And like before, it returned, growing both brighter and bigger once again.  it repeated this for about ten minutes before finally growing dim and disappearing for good.  my whole family saw it.  it wasn't a plane.  nor anything else i've ever seen.  it wasn't a surprise to me that seconds after it had vanished, a single jet flew directly over where it had been, turned around, and flew away.  hmm....;45.5248370535713;-122.961403125001
colorful pulsating ufo over Hillsboro Oregon [jellyfish like!];2009-02-21 00:30:00;3-4 hours;colorful pulsating ufo over Hillsboro Oregon [jellyfish like!] I let my dog out at about 12:30 am and looked up to the sky at the stars.  I live in Oregon, so this time of year, you don't get to see the stars very often-It was a beautiful clear night.  This star was just too strange-It seemed too close to the earth, and I could plainly see it pulsating with vibrant colors.  I ran into the house to grab my digital camera, and began filming.  It did some amazing rotating, and moved several times over the next two hours.  All in all, I saw five of these in the night sky, but none as close as this one, and then this one bacame a pinprick pretty fast. This was the best footage I got.  What do you think?  I see that I'm not the only one out there seeing these in the sky.  I don't know if it's an actual extraterrestrial vehicle, or a government vehicle, or even an entity but all I can say is that is NOT a planet, that is NOT a helicopter, and if you've watched this full screen, you will see it rotate into three distinct parts.  Please [politely] let me know what you think of this.  My husband and I have been fighting ever since, because he insists it's a planet whose light is refracting thru the cosmos. Phooey.  That's no planet!  Like I said, it came closer and then became a pinprick, and then came closer, and moved left and right over several hours.  A UHO unidentified hovering object, if you will! =);45.5248370535713;-122.961403125001
