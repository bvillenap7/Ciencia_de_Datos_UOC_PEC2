I was riding a bike in a hurry to get somewhere when I noticed my shoelace was untied.  I stopped bent tied my shoe and right as i was about to rush off again I noticed something from the left corner of my eye I looked up and over to the left their it was. Hovering  no higher then a 3 story apartment building.  I didn't know what I was looking at the shape was teardrop-ish dark colored at first.  Next it started its engine like a car only instead of engine noise the objects sides lite up just like a car starting its engine without the noise once started it stayed lit.  Then I could see the whole bottom very clearly.  It was like a see though radio or something  how you can see all the wiring and the circuit board.  It took of with speed and like a flash of lightning it lite the sky and it was gone.;45.5248370535713;-122.961403125001
