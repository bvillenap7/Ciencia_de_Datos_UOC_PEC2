Never seen a solid green fireball before. I didn't see no other colors. Pretty amazing sight.;45.5248370535713;-122.961403125001
A bright flash of white light shot across the sky in an instant with no sound;2002-07-04 22:45:00;1/2 second;A bright flash of white light shot across the sky in an instant with no sound It was like a flash through the sky.  I didn't really have time to make out the exact shape of the object because it moved so fast.  I have never in my life seen something move that fast and it was bright too.  It left a bright streak in my vision, so that when I closed my eyes I could still see it.  The other two witnesses saw something similiar, though there is some disagreement on the color of the light.  I felt that it was a white light, and one of the other witnesses claims it was more yellowish.  But we are all agreed on the fact that it flew from one end of the sky to another in half a second or even just a flash.  It was like a bolt of lightning was shot horizontally across the sky.  One other thing is that it made no sound.  It is hard to say how far away it was from us, but it was definitely close enough to where if it was an airplane, we would have been able to hear the engine, but this thing made no sound whatsoever.  Both of my witnesses are  credible, reliable people with good jobs and nice families.  This is ((NUFORC Note:  We presume that the witness implies an evening sighting.  We have changed the time to 22:45 hrs..  PD));45.5248370535713;-122.961403125001

We got out and saw three “fireballs” (orange - seemed to be radiating slightly - not just a light dot) moving from north to south at medium speed.  Not planes, not meteors.  One disappeared, then the next, then the next. Each one slowly dimmed until they were no longer visible.  There was one plane in the vicinity which seemed to be moving in the same direction.  We got at least two videos, but they don't do them justice.  They look like plain, small dots in the videos.  In real life, they weren't so abruptly shaped.  You might say there was an aura or haze..  There was no trail. I've seen youtube videos showing three dots in this very same formation (closest is lowest, second is highest, third is in between).  Running car may have started revving a little harder/rougher.;45.5248370535713;-122.961403125001
