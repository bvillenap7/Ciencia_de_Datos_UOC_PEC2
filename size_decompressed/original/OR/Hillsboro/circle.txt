Green ball with a pink/red tail entering our atmosphere , then flying of over the horizon.;2003-09-05 23:30:00;3sec;Green ball with a pink/red tail entering our atmosphere , then flying of over the horizon. Me and my friend were driving on this dark mountain road by our house when all of the sudden we saw a glowing,bright green ball, with a reddish/pink tail come down like it was entering our atmosphere.The ball began to shoot of (in our atmosphere)over the hills about 20-30 miles away, it was almost as if it was circling our atmosphere to check it out.The object came in pretty slow then very quickly left.i cant really explain what it was when i saw it i wasn't sure if my friend did or not but his and my reaction answered that question.I used to not believe in life out there, now i sure  do!    ( unfortunately i had no camera at hand );45.5248370535713;-122.961403125001
Five round orange lights over Hillsboro, Oregon;2013-02-02 20:00:00;3-5 minutes;Five round orange lights over Hillsboro, Oregon Saw two orange round lights moving slowly across the sky one after the other.  No sound that we could hear.  They were flying east to west and the light seemed to look like a flame as the light was not completely steady, but not blinking, either. About 30 minutes later, we saw three more lights behaving the same as the first two, one after another in the same area as the first sighting.;45.5248370535713;-122.961403125001
Airshow 2014.;2014-09-20 19:00:00;15+;Airshow 2014. I saw five smaller white circular lights slowly moving vertical.  They were about 200 ft when I noticed them.  They then started moving around slowly like as if it was observing something.  Could be a drone watching the airshow that weekend, but when the would hold perfectly still and then take off I was a little curious.;45.5248370535713;-122.961403125001
