Red stationary lights in sky.;2014-01-24 21:20:00;2 minutes;Red stationary lights in sky. 5 to 6 red dots.  Did not appear to have flashing strobe or rotating red beacon light found on aircraft.   Lights remained stationary in a random pattern top to bottom.  No sound detected.   Gradually began to move apart and then fade away until only one was left.   No explanation for what was witnessed.;45.5248370535713;-122.961403125001
10 silent, red craft traveling in a line, shifting precisely to avoid something.;2014-10-02 21:00:00;15 seconds;10 silent, red craft traveling in a line, shifting precisely to avoid something Traveling from east to west, 10 craft traveled at high speed equally spaced.   They passed in front of Cassiopeia, glowing red with a pink radiant center.  At one point, they shifted position, one by one, much like in the 1980's video game Centipede when it was avoiding an obstacle.   The look of the individual 'craft' was reminiscent of what was recorded during the Phoenix Lights.;45.5248370535713;-122.961403125001
Hovering, Slow-Blinking Light Object Behind Clouds Studying Us From WAY Up.;2019-04-29 22:10:00;hours;Hovering, Slow-Blinking Light Object Behind Clouds Studying Us From WAY Up I was helping a friend move his car from my parking lot.  As I walked out into the night air, I suddenly stopped in my tracks and looked up (I still don’t know why or what reason I did that) as my friend continued walking.  It was that strong sense you get when someone is looking at you that drew me to look up, I think. (I don’t know which direction, like NW, SE, etc. …sorry, I’m a girl) – but I can tell you I was in Hillsboro, OR, in the Orenco Platform District.  Though its light(s) were very dim at first, my eyes locked on it immediately.  It was way too high up to be a plane (and a few did cross underneath as I stared).  It blinked at me slowly, as if acknowledging that it was seeing me (or watching the area).  The light strobed from soft white to yellow to blue and red, in random order.  It was stationary, hovering, but it would jerk to its left or right in a millisecond, then up or down, but for the most part, remained in its general spot high up in the clouds. Then I started noticing other lights just like it in the clouds, in the periphery.  Together the lights formed a gigantic circle, outlining some kind of enormous craft half-hidden behind the clouds, and just…surveying.  I sat out there for a good 45 minutes and it continued to blink and slightly jolt and return to its position.  And it was clear there were many others with him…or it.  It was eerie but absolutely mesmerizing.  I did take pics and videos with my iPhone but they aren't great.;45.5248370535713;-122.961403125001
