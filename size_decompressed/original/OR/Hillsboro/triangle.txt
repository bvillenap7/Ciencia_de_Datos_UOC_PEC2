Not moving..No sound....Lights went out & object sped away NNW Was driving home fom a friends place late in evening.  Noticed lights over the field nearby.  Looked strange enough to warrant me getting out of my car.  Looked up, expecting it to be a helicopter as it was so close to AIRPORT.  No sound...Noted the Triangular shape.  Roughly 150 feet per side.  Dual Red light bands Horizontal on side facing me.  Did not have any means to record it...And road had not traffic while I was observing.  After about 10 mins..Lights went out & object sped away rapidly to the NNW towards the mouth of the Columbia River.  Lost sight of it almost immeadiately as it was jet black.;45.5248370535713;-122.961403125001
Quiet triangular craft, bright white lights, reduced to rapidly flashing blue & red lights, disappeared like a twinkling star;2007-07-01 22:10:00;3 minutes;Quiet triangular craft, bright white lights, reduced to rapidly flashing blue & red lights, disappeared like a twinkling star Quiet triangular craft, bright white lights, seemed to reduced to rapidly flashing blue & red lights, almost as if shutting down, but then flew farther up and pretty much out of sight until it looked like a twinkling star - (flew in front of noisy twin engine craft which seemed to promptly turn around to take a second look at the object which had just flown past it);45.5248370535713;-122.961403125001
Dull black triangle with 4 lights moved quickly overhead from horizon to horizon;2013-09-11 23:00:00;15 seconds;Dull black triangle with 4 lights moved quickly overhead from horizon to horizon While sitting on the back porch of a friends house i saw a large, dull-black triangular object move very quickly overhead from the southern horizon to the north.  It caught my attention because of the odd shape with 4 lights and how quickly it moved.  I observed it for a total of maybe 15 seconds.  The first few seconds i was trying to determine if it was a plane after i realized it was triangular with no wings i tried to determine if it was maybe a cluster of shooting stars or some other explanation, but it became very obvious just as it was moving directly above me that it was at a low elevation and a solid object.   As it flew directly over the top of me i was amazed to hear no sound at all.  My friend was unable to see it as well as i was because of trees blocking his view, but he agrees that he has never seen anything (satellite or plane) move that fast from horizon to horizon without making any sound at all. Since he was only able to see 1 of the 4 redish l! ights he though it was a satellite, however he quickly realized it was moving far too fast for that to be the case.   I probably would have convinced myself that i was seeing things if i hadn't actually watched it from horizon to horizon without taking my eyes off of it once.;45.5248370535713;-122.961403125001
Cluster of glowing orange triangular crafts slowly move together in silence above the city rooftops;2015-02-15 19:00:00;2 minutes;Cluster of glowing orange triangular crafts slowly move together in silence above the city rooftops. I stepped outside on the way to my car in the 7pm darkness on 2/15/15 in Hillsboro, Oregon.  My eyes caught a glimpse of some lights up in the sky as I faced south. I was quickly amazed to observe a cluster of 9–10 glowing orange triangular (isosceles) shaped objects that I would describe as having a burning quality of glowing orange.   The orange glow turned to red glowing at the back end of the object.  I first thought they might be some type of burning debris falling towards the earth.  However, I quickly ruled that out as they were all uniform in shape, size and consistent in their orange glow intensity. Although the size of these crafts could be compared to a private airplane from my viewpoint, they did not look like planes or helicopters as they had no head or tail lights and were absolutely silent as they sailed fairly low above the city rooftops.  I am not a person who goes around looking for UFO’s by any means, but I must admit I was a bit mesmerized by these very unusual glowing objects.   I got in my car quickly and decided I would attempt to follow them, but as I got in and backed up to turn out of the driveway I looked up again and just like that they had all completely vanished.  They truly were unlike anything I have ever seen and I am certain others had to have seen them as well!;45.5248370535713;-122.961403125001
Truangle tracked for 20 minutes headed west;2020-12-28 17:35:00;20 minutes;Truangle tracked for 20 minutes headed west At approximately 17:35 on December 28th, 2020, I was heading home from Ham Radio Outlet on SW Pacific Ave in Portland OR on Tile Flat Rd westbound between SW Scholls Ferry Rd and SW Farmington Rd to my home in Forest Grove OR.  After passing the intersection with SW Clark Hill Rd I noticed what appeared to be three bright white lights appearing to mark the outside corners of a solid object at about 25 degrees above the horizon.  I would estimate the object to have had about 100 feet between each light on the bottom side.  There were more lights along one edge of the object.  I was unable to stop on that road to get any pictures. I turned onto SW Farmington Rd heading west.  I went through the intersection at SW Road Bridge Rd and could again see the object.  By this time, it had lowered to about 18 degrees above the horizon and was quite noticeably further from me and continuing to move slowly away. I turned onto Highway 219 northbound towards Hillsboro and drove for about 1 ¼ miles and was able to find a safe place to pull off the road.  The time was 17:48.  The object was visible about 8 degrees off the horizon just above the coast range mountains.  I was able to get a little over three minutes of video of the object.  The camera I used was unable to get a consistent clear image, but it appears to clearly show at least two of the three corner lights and a couple of the back edge lights.  The one closest to me was the brightest with the rest being visible, but dimmer.  I tried pointing to it for people driving by, but apparently I was unable to catch their attention to stop and view it.  After I stopped the camera, I tried to reach it with a 5 mA blue laser with no reaction.  I was able to see it periodically for about the next ten minutes as I continued on my way home, but then it disappeared below the horizon.  The sighting lasted from 17:35 to about 17:55. Below is as close a rendition as I could recollect.  Reflection on the incident reminded me that there were lights along one edge, but I cannot clearly remember the exact configuration of those lights. I believe they were round as well.;45.5248370535713;-122.961403125001
