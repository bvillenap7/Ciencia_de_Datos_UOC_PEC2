Last night as the Sapranos came on HBO, ((name deleted)) my wifes son said look at that light out our second floor living room window. It looked like a small airplane was in the sky with landing lights on. Location South of Famington Road by like 5-20 Miles and South of the hills in the back ground before hillsboro metro. (Say go left for 10 mi. from Farmington at 210th) As I saw it I told him I thought it was a plane and went back to watching the show. THEN, he said oh my god look at that, THAT IS NOT A PLANE! I looked and saw the light suddenly get wider in the sky like 10 airplane landing lights side by side and it was at like a 25 degree angle in the sky! It was flashing as bright as an arc welder and looking like a giant crack in the sky with an arc welder showing through from behind! Then it got small and dim once again. Then it faded out and came on in an area that was across the sky and this time had a dim red light that pulsed dim then bright. It was moving very slowly towards the original spot and then it kinda started to glow brighter and the red light faded and it kept repeating this dimming out of site on a clear starry night and then appearing in another spot and then flashing very brightly not like any thing you have ever seen in the air. Like sparks in an arc welder at say maybe 2000 feet. I ran for my video cam and started to film what this light was doing as it seemed to have a kinda revolving black circle or spot that went around it and the whole thing started to change colors like a lava lamp of rainbow colors very bright. At sdome points the lights were almost to bright to look directly at. This whole color thing lasted for only a short few seconds, but made us all gasp as did the bright welding flashes. I said enough and ran for the van with my cam. I went out to Farmington at about 206th and started West. I stopped after turning left onto a side road. I could see it about 5 miles away between me and the hillside. It was not just blinking kinda red and looked a lot like a helicopters lights but made no sound on this very quiet country road. Suddenly as I pulled over up the road (I thought I still had the cam on stand bye but I later found I was too shocked to hit start button.) I stopped to see a better cam shot and it pointed a direct red light more in my direction that looked sort of directional. Then it let got dim white and let out a very bright! white b urst of light that made me gasp! I went on but couldn't get closer and finally lost it among the skyline. PLEASE ANYONE THAT SAW THIS TELL WHAT YOU SAW! WE HAVE THE VIDEO IF YOU WANNA SEE IT, email me at ((e-mail address deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Second report from same area, same witness.  We will request a copy of the video tape and look at the object.  PD));45.5248370535713;-122.961403125001
Strange light in Hillsboro, OR  (1 week after same type of sighting reported in Hillsboro by other witnesses.);2001-05-26 01:15:00;20 minutes;Strange light in Hillsboro, OR  (1 week after same type of sighting reported in Hillsboro by other witnesses.) Early Saturday morning of May 26th around 0100, I went outside for some fresh air and gaze at some stars. It was very nice outside so I went back in to tell my girlfriend to come out and see a very beautiful nightsky, since we're both avid stargazers. She came out and I went back inside for a few minutes, as I watching TV, she ran in the house to grab the binoculars, saying she's seeing strange lights flying around. She ran in again and told me to hurry up and come out. OK, OK I said to myself, probably a airplane or something. I waited for a commercial to come on and went outside. She excitedly gave me the binoculars and pointed to the direction of these lights. Before raising the binocs to my eyes, I saw a couple of flashes in the distance, low on the horizon maybe 20 to 30 degrees up. As I looked in the glasses, sure enough, a flashing & dancing light, blinking reds, whites and blues. The direction we were looking was a SSE direction from our patio. It was flashing on & off changing colors and moving so erraticly, I knew right away I was seeing something strange, not an airplane, a star, or planet. We're both amature astronomers and look at the nightsky alot, we both never seen anything close to this! My girlfriend had been watching this object for about 10 minutes before me, and I observed this for about 10 minutes myself. The way this light was moving around was so strange, blinking and showing up in a different direction, but staying in 1 general area the whole time we watched it. I strated getting dimmer towards the end and slowly sank below a distant tree and disappeared. We both are clueless on what this was, a definante UFO dancing under a very beautiful Mars and flashing in and around a rising Sagittarius constellation. Just Incredible! I thought about this websight right away since I reported a fireball a few months earlier. Low and behold! Checked the May 2001 reports and saw a report of a light seen in Hillsboro, OR by 3 witnesses on May 20th, word for word described exactly like what we'd seen (on May 26th) We could'nt believe it. They reported having a videotape of their sighting. We don't have any photographic evidence, but sure would like to see their video! Other witnesses said they seen the object in the vicinity of Farmington Road and 210th Ave. Thats the exact area we were seeing our sighting, we're loacted by the area of Minter Bridge and River roads, a couple of miles from Farmington Road.  Again, really need to see this video! Thanks;45.5248370535713;-122.961403125001

Upon turning my eyes skyward, a very bright, white light caught my attention. It looked like a star, but very bright, brighter that anything I've ever seen in the sky other than the sun and moon. It was west from my position, at an azimuth of about 50-60 degrees. It shone for about 10 seconds in the same position, then faded away, shrinking in size and diminishing in intensity until it was no longer visible, as if it were either simply disappearing or traveling away in a straight line at a speed great enough to leave the atmosphere within seconds. I observed the area for another 10 to 15 minutes, but no further activity was noted.;45.5248370535713;-122.961403125001
Big, bright, white, light receding quickly from view.;2001-07-22 00:31:00;5 seconds;Big, bright, white, light receding quickly from view. Brilliant white light 5 times as bright as Mars and 3 times as big in appearance.  Mars was in view at the time.  Heading generally west, by NW.  Quickly flew away, dimming to nothing.  Other witness saw it roll into view growing in brightness before receding from view.  That witness is a student pilot and states that is not a charachteristic of standard flight patterns.;45.5248370535713;-122.961403125001

After a series of turns in my car I looked again and saw that the lights hadn't moved and was amazed to see them suddenly blink out.  Therefore - whatever it was had been stationary for 3 mins. at least - and wasn't an aircraft coming into land.  All I saw were extremely bright white lights.;45.5248370535713;-122.961403125001

We saw three amber balls of light appear at four minute intervals and move south/southwest then fade and disappear;2011-07-04 22:48:00;8 minutes;We saw three amber balls of light appear at four minute intervals and move south/southwest then fade and disappear Last night on the 4th of July my husband and I were laying in bed watching the fireworks out our window, which faces east.   At 1046pm we saw a bright glowing ball of amber colored light appear high in the air.   At first we thought it was a firework, but then it didnâ€™t descend, rather it started moving towards the south/south east.   We thought it strange, but possibly just an odd angle on an aircraft, but there were no blinking lights, just a solid amber color and VERY bright.  Too bright to be a star.  As it moved to the south/ south east at a very good clip it faded and disappeared.   Four minutes later another one appeared in the same spot of the sky moved in the exact same direction and disappeared.   At this point we jumped out of bed and started to watch to see if another would arrive.  Precisely four minutes after the previous one another one appeared and moved the exact same way.  All in all three shapes that all appeared in the east, moved south/ southwest of Hillsboro, Oregon at 1048pm, 1052pm and 1056pm.;45.5248370535713;-122.961403125001
Observed what appeared to be a fast satellite stop move in controlled impossible maneuvers then assume original trajectory;2011-08-19 21:30:00;2-3 min;Observed what appeared to be a fast satellite stop move in controlled impossible maneuvers then assume original trajectory My sister and I were looking at stars in a clear dark sky 30-40 minutes after an airshow at Hillsboro Oregon Airport.  Someone noticed what appeared to be a fast moving satellite traveling almost straight overhead from south west to north east.  I was explaining how objects remain in orbit when the object appeared to stop then move in obviously controlled maneuvers.   We continued to watch for what seemed like one or two minutes as the object made seemingly impossible changes in direction. It made 90 degree corners, tight S turns, circles and at one point seemed to brighten in color just for a second like a spark from an arc welder.  The object then returned to its original trajectory until it was out of sight.   I am an amature astronomer, a pilot and I have seen many satellites and aircraft. What we saw was very clear, too high to have been an airplane and appeared to do things that if manned would not have been survivable.;45.5248370535713;-122.961403125001

Bright light above coastal range observed for 20 mins;2013-07-10 22:00:00;20 minutes;Bright light above coastal range observed for 20 mins Driving west on US26 from exit 65 (185th) immediately noticed very bright light in western sky over coastal range. Sun had set fully and sky was purplish but no stars were visible (not even faintly).  This was 10 times brighter than a single star and seemingly 5 times larger (tho it was clear we were viewing it at a great distance).   The light was stationary or moving very slowly.  At the beginning of our viewing I would estimate it at 45Â° above horizon by the end of our sighting 20 mins later it seemed more like 20Â° above horizon after which we drove into trees and lost it.   It was not a plane as we saw a small engine pass by (3-5 miles away). Later in sighting, stars did come out so we could compare both light sources (they were not the same).  It was too large for helicopter.  We took photo and video with iphone 4 but they only show a speck of light.   This may be unrelated but upon arriving at the coast an hour later we saw and heard the last three loops (15 mi! n intervals) of a lone military jet circling out over the ocean with our small northern beach town as the eastern edge of that loop.;45.5248370535713;-122.961403125001
7 red lights.;2014-07-04 23:00:00;30 minutes;7 red lights This occurred on 4th of July, coming home from watching fireworks. I know because of this, what we witnessed could be easily dismissed.  But the sightings were spread over the Hillsboro area, and uniform in appearance. We saw red lights stationary in the sky.  There was no distinguishable form other than the lights.  I first saw three of these lights in the north, each at different altitudes from our perspective.   They faded from view, only to have two more float up from above the horizon (tree line and surrounding rooftops) into the sky.   These lights quickly blinked out. I thought these probably were lanterns, the kind with little candles in them.  But then I observed two more lights in the south, already very high in the sky.   The color was a vibrant ruby color, not likely candle lit.  They had a slow pulsating light that very in intensity.  These lights were only visible for a few minutes before they faded out. There were no noise.  The moved like they were floating.  If it were two or three objects like these I would dismiss them.  But there were seven that I witnessed in two different directions, roughly five miles from where I viewed them.  Really unusual.   I have never seen anything like it before.;45.5248370535713;-122.961403125001
