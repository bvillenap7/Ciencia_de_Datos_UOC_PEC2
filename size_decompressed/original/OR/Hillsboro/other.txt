This sighting was detected  on photos I took of a sunset.;2015-10-10 18:46:00;?;This sighting was detected  on photos I took of a sunset. I was just revising some sunset pictures that I took with my camera. When I downloaded the pictures tonight, I found this strange object on 2 of the photos only.  These were taken last Oct. 10, 2015, and at 6:46 pm  if the time was right on my camera,  did not check.  I called my husband in to see if he also saw what I was seeing,  we were shocked.  I checked the dozen of photos I took several nights in a row, and only 2 photos had this stange sighting. I have saved these photos if needed.  This was over Hillsboro, Or. seems like coming from West to East.  Sending photos to the email address provided below.;45.5248370535713;-122.961403125001
Metallic Orange Ring Shaped Object Over Hillsboro Oregon;2017-04-21 12:11:00;5 minutes;Metallic Orange Ring Shaped Object Over Hillsboro Oregon I was working in the backyard and looked up and noticed an object in the Western sky above the roof of my garage.  It was shaped like a ring or a doughnut, with a large hole in the middle.  It was a metallic orange color that reflected light as it moved in the sky.  It was completely silent and slowly moved horizontally against the wind from North to Southwest across the field of view. It did not change elevation as it was flying and made very strange movements.  For most of the time I saw it, it was flat, but then suddenly it would flip up so you could really see the ‘O’ shape of it and I could see right through it.  As it headed further Southwest out of my view, I ran and got my husband so we could both go out in the front yard and watch it from there.  He also saw it and we stood there watching it for another minute or so.  It got smaller as it went further West and just disappeared. Here is the link to the video I posted on YouTube of part of what I saw.   https://youtu.be/oaAf3teZrvg;45.5248370535713;-122.961403125001
Metallic object hovering over Hillsboro Oregon for an hour;2017-05-19 10:36:00;1 hour;Metallic object hovering over Hillsboro Oregon for an hour Was outside in the backyard, and noticed a metallic highly reflective object in the sky to the south of my neighborhood.  It really didn't move much, it just hung there in the sky, no sound at all.   Through the binoculars I could see it was an irregular shape, but definitely some kind of metal reflective object.  We live near a small airport and there were airplanes flying around the area at the same time.  They must have seen this thing?   I took a video of the object and some photos.  After almost an hour in that one spot, it just disappeared.  I didn't see it leave, it literally just disappeared before my eyes.;45.5248370535713;-122.961403125001
