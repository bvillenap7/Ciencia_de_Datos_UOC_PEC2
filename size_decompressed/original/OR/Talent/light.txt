Green and White Falling Object, Near Ashland, Or;2006-10-17 22:02:00;5 Second;Green and White Falling Object, Near Ashland, Or I was stopped at a stop sign and looked to the East. East of Talent (near Ashland), I saw a large light travel towards the ground. It was a large object White and Green in color. From my point of view I could not see if the object hit the ground or not. I watched the object for almost 2 seconds before it went down behind the hills to the East. This object was too big to be a shooting star, and the green color was nothing I have seen before in the night sky. The object traveled from West to East covering nearly half the night sky in 2 seconds.;42.2372;-122.7779
Red/Yellow orb West of Medford, Oregon, Christmas Eve.;2012-12-24 19:30:00;5-7 minutes;Red/Yellow orb West of Medford, Oregon, Christmas Eve. On Christmas eve around 7:15, In the sky northwest of Medford Oregon, we saw some kind of flying object.  The object was on a west to east track at approximately 6-10K feet.  It had a bright red light and glow that would slowly change to yellow then back to red.  It did not have running lights or wing  beacons. From our observation place, the light was the size and brightness that one would see on top of a cell tower mast about .5 mile away.  In the Christmas spirit, we remarked that it could be Rodolph the red nosed reindeer. In reality it was bright enough to hold our attention due to its unique glow.  Given its location, in the Medford airspace, we thought it was a private plane at first, or a small remote.  We heard no motor or jet.  At one point its east bound track paused and then it reversed direction it did not turn around like an aircraft, it just changed directions and appeared to go up in altitude until it faded away into the heavens.;42.2372;-122.7779

It then jolted right and diagonal left, then again hovered and blinked out.   As two more people arrived and we told them our experience and they began to discredit us, another light came up over the horizon at an astonishing speed.  It then copied the patterns of the first and again blinked a couple times and faded into nothing.;42.2372;-122.7779
Bright white light moving up & away rapidly to the SE, near the star Arcturus, becoming smaller as it traveled East, turned red & gone.;2015-04-18 21:31:00;5-8 seconds;Bright white light moving up & away rapidly to the SE, near the star Arcturus, becoming smaller as it traveled East, turned red & gone. On this relatively clear evening I viewed a steady bright light, like the evening 'star' Venus, about the size of Venus, white in color, in the Eastern sky to the right and below the star Arcturus,  It was noticibly brighter than any other stars in the sky, and appeared to be at a great distance from me.  It was moving rapidly to the East and upward.  I used the star Arcturs to judge the object's movement up and away from me.   As it moved, the light grew smaller and smaller and just before disappearing appeared to change to a red color.  There was no sound associated with it.;42.2372;-122.7779
