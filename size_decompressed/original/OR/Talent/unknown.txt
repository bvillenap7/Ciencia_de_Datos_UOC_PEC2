I live in Southern Oregon along Interstate 5.;2013-12-03 21:45:00;1 minute;I live in Southern Oregon along Interstate 5. I was out throwing a ball for my dog tonight, it was super dark and very cold, so perfect star viewing.  As I was looking up at the stars between throws, I glimpsed what I thought was a shooting star, I gazed back and found it again and realized it was actually an aircraft. I noticed right away that it did not have the typical green and red lights, and nothing was blinking.  I have flown planes so am very familiar with their patterns, speeds, sounds, etc.  This was truly strange because of only the very dim red lights on each side of the aircraft, because of its high rate of speed and because it was absolutely silent. There was no way to tell the size or speed, because I couldn’t really tell what I was looking at, there was absolutely no sound at all.  I can only approximate what I saw. I would estimate that it was traveling above Interstate 5 in a Southern direction at an altitude of approximately 2,000 feet above the ground and at a speed of roughly 700 mph.  I would approximate the aircraft to be about 75’ wide, no idea of length…very dark sky. I am a completely sane individual and am just very interested in finding out what the heck it was that I saw.  I am guessing that maybe it is an electric drone practice run..?  but again, nor typical navigation lights. Hope someone out there saw it also, and maybe has an answer for me.
