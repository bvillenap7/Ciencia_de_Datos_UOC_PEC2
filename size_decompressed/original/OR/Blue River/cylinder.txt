I then saw that the object had two lights. I retreived my binoculars. The two lights were at the ends of a cylinder. I watched the object until my view was obstructed by trees. At 20:45 (PST) on 04-September-1998 I observed an object in the sky travelling in a northwestern direction. At first I believed the object was a satellite. As I watched the object I noticed that it had two lights and not one. I quickly obtained my binoculars so that I could observe the object more clearly. Upon doing so, I noticed that the two lights were at the ends of a cylinder-shaped object. It was difficult to make any other details of the craft out as the magnification of my binoculars are not that high. The lights on the object were about the color of a star and did not blink as you would find with aviation lights. I observed the object flying in a straight line with no sound. the object appeared to be travelling at a slow pace then seemed to gain in speed. I watched the object until my view was obstructed by trees in the area. It is difficult to say what color the cylinder was, it appeared almost transparent, yet it appeared solid. This is not the first time I have had a sighting in this area, to date this is my fourth.;44.173;-122.1209
