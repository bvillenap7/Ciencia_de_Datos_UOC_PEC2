I looked out the door and saw it bright as could be hoovering, I first thought it was a star then realized that the lights were flashing and moving ever so slightly.  It was amazing, I was in awe.  Bright lights, hoovering in one spot about 1 mile south of Columbia River.  See lights, different shapes as if expanding, moved far up in altitude very quickly. We could see white, green, yellow lights. It moved as if it was scanning.  It was very still for a minute then did some moving to the right then in altitude then lower, after a couple more minutes it went even further in altitude til we could no longer see it.;45.8891;-119.4986
