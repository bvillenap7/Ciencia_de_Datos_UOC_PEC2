3 satelite-like objects flying in tight formation over Oregon.;1999-09-08 21:00:00;less than 5 min;3 satelite-like objects flying in tight formation over Oregon. I finally just got around to checking the files of your site against an experience I had at the date given above.  I was happy to see three other reports from my region, event times given only minutes apart.  I'm referring to the collection of three satellite-like objects which behaved in the usual satellite-like way, the only freaky thing about it being the fact that there were THREE of these things flying in formation, it would seem.  I can add little else to the descriptions from Bellingham WA, Albany, OR, save that I asked a friend of mine in the Air force about it and he said I should definietly regard it as highly peculiar.  We observed these things for nearly 3-4 minutes.;44.3701;-123.6053
