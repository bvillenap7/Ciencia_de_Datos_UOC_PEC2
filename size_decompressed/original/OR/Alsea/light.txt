Report(s) explained as NOSS satellite array;1999-09-08 20:00:00;3-4 minutes;Report(s) explained as NOSS satellite array I gave this report on the date indicated and have since learned that the event has a mundane explanation, which you can read more about at this link: http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A2265815   My reporting this as a UFO pretty much hinges on the perceived unusual nature of the sighting.  I have since learned that we were all probably seeing an NOSS array, which is something my Air Force buddy didn't know about, probably because it's part of a Naval operation.  Apparently, at least one array of satellites does travel in formation. That report:   Occurred : 9/8/1999 21:00 (Entered as : 09/08/99 9-10pm)  Reported: 7/2/2000 01:55 Posted: 2/5/2003  Location: Alsea, OR  Shape: Formation Duration:less than 5 min 3 satelite-like objects flying in tight formation over Oregon. I finally just got around to checking the files of your site against an experience I had at the date given above.  I was happy to see three other reports from my region, event times given only minutes apart. I'm referring to the collection of three satellite-like objects which behaved in the usual satellite-like way, the only freaky thing about it being the fact that there were THREE of these things flying in formation, it would seem.  I can add little else to the descriptions from Bellingham WA, Albany, OR, save that I asked a friend of mine in the Air force about it and he said I should definitely regard it as highly peculiar.   We observed these things for nearly 3-4 minutes.;44.3701;-123.6053
Two bright balls of light ascending over forested area.;2012-06-20 19:00:00;1 minute;Two bright balls of light ascending over forested area While on an evening hike, my friend and I witnessed two bright balls of light quickly ascending into the sky a few miles away from us. They were over a forested area that has minimal air traffic.  They ascended at a steep angle, going from approximately 2,000 feet to 8,000 feet in about a minute and a half, with a slight wavering motion at times. Both of the lights went into a thin layer of clouds and disappeared. The cloud layer was thin enough that the lights should have been easily visible a couple seconds after passing through, but both disappeared in the same manner.  The lights stayed a continous bright shade of white during the entire incident and didn't appear to be reflecting light from the sun, but were rather self-illuminated.
