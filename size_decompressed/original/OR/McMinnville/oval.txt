Glowing oval and flying triangle observed in McMinnville Oregon;2002-04-17 21:45:00;5 seconds;Glowing oval and flying triangle observed in McMinnville Oregon My 9 year old son witnessed this from his bedroom window.  I am reporting what he reported, mainly to see if anyone else reports a similar sighting near the same location and time. He saw a glowing yellow oval or egg shaped object fly past his bedroom window from west to east. It originally was flying slowly, but he had the impression it saw him watching and then quickly accelerated.  This was followed about 3 seconds later by a triangular shaped object with a row of lights on it, following the same path. If you have any independent sightings of this phenomenon near this location and time, could you please inform me by email?  Thanks. ((NUFORC Note:  I met with the 9-yr. old witness, and his parents, in McMinnville, OR, on the evening of Friday, May 10, 2002, and I found them to be unusually credible witnesses.  I saw the illustration, drawn by the son, who is apparently quite familiar with all types of military and civilian aircraft, and the objects he illustrates are quite unusual in appearance.
