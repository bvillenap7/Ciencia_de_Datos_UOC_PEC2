(One side of the road was forest and the other side was a wheat field.)  As we were walking talking about the fact that it was strangely bright out I see out of the corner of my eye something that looked like a shooting star.  When I actually looked at it I realized that it was not a shooting star I yelled out to my friend what is that and it was gone.  My friend was a little behind me and he says that he saw a bright light through the trees. The object kinda looked like a comet or I guess a shooting star but the thing that threw me off is that the light was blueish and it stayed visible longer then a shooting star. Also I checked live UFO maps and in all the town's near McMinnville there were sightings a lot like mine in the past week.  That's really it that I can think of right now if you wanna talk about this email me;45.21;-123.2003
