Immediately, I knew it could not be a star because it was cloudy that night. I stood up and walked to the glass trying to see what it was. I was looking to the North.  The light was bright white and appeared to be 2 lights on the same craft. The upper light was almost the full length of the craft, the lower light was square and connected by something black or dark, about the same size. I only saw lights and the dark connecting piece. It was so bright I believe it would be visible in daylight. The lights moved completely in tandem. They were each the same color and brightness as Venus. Both lights had a twinkle effect like stars.  The object was about 1/2” tall at arm’s length, a narrow vertical rectangular light moving erratically within about a 1” x 1” area: north, south, east and west, gradually moving to the West. If the object was 1/2” tall overall, it would be about 3/32” wide. The bottom light would be about 3/32” square. The black area between the 2 lit areas was also about 3/32” square.  I moved around making sure of what I was seeing. It was not a reflection on the glass or on the clouds. I heard no sound, my cat did not react, I didn’t open the window. The object gradually, still erratically, moved west behind a tree in my backyard. At arm’s length it moved about 1” to the West before it was no longer visible. This took about 1-1/2 minutes. It was about as high as two, 2-story houses from my 2nd-floor vantage point.  My Background: 77 years old retired artist mom & grandmother live with a cat;45.21;-123.2003
