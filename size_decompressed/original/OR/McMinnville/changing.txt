I looked out my bathroom window and saw what I at first believed to be a bright star that was low in the sky. On further inspection the star-like object while stationary hovered just below the tops of the hills. It continued to hover but appeared to change shape like from a circle to a v like shape to a line and it was bright but was a soft white in color and changed to an amberish-orange color. I watched it morph shape and change color without moving for approximately 5 minutes before returning to bedroom and I haven't been able to go back to sleep. I've seen other lights out here but they didn't seem so close. I just found this website as well. I have had a few experiences I can't explain.;45.21;-123.2003
