All 3 of us are trying to figure out what this could have been.;2015-04-25 20:30:00;5+ minutes;All 3 of us are trying to figure out what this could have been. We were driving north on Hill Road, just west of McMinnville, Ore., just after sunset.   We noticed a strange sphere type object due east of us.  It was oscillatiing red and orange, and looked to be just a couple of hundred feet over the rooftops.  At that time it looked as bright as Venus but a little larger and was pulsing red to orange.   We stopped the car and observed it as it headed due east away and up at a high rate of speed for 10 or so seconds.  It got dimmer and dimmer, and then it vanished.   The total time we observed the object was about 5 minutes.  There was no noticeable noise, but we were pretty excited, the truck was running and we were talking all at once.
