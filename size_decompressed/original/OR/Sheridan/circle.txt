3 round white lighted objects,hovering then moving quickly across sky,then hovered then went quickly up into space.;2002-05-01 23:30:00;10 minutes;3 round white lighted objects,hovering then moving quickly across sky,then hovered then went quickly up into space. started as 2 round white objects hovering in sky above house on the ridge. 1 smaller than the other,size difference i think because 1 was back farther from the other. got out video camera after about 5 minutes because they were so perfectly round i figured they had to be ufo's of something of the sort. started video taping for about 1 minute and they started moving across the sky toward the north or from left to right. took off down the road trying to keep them in sight. they stopped again and then as i was video taping 1 more came up from over the ridge, it was huge,a lot closer than the others. i zoomed in on it with the night vision and it took up almost the whole screen of the camera,perfect circle with circlular rings going in different directions,had some small indents in the sides. on the big screen t.v. it almost looks like it has several oblong doors in it and maybe even some odd type of lettering on it. i have it on tape for 2-3 minutes it seemed to get closer ,i got kinda worried and took off. all three shot off at about a 45 degree angle upward until they disappeared into space. i just found the tape again it was misplaced at my house for about a year. the footage is good enough that i would like to make some money off it,everyone that i've shown it too, can't believe what they are seeing.
