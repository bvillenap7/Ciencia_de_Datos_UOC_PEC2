shooting star ZIG ZAGS Seaside, Oregon.;2012-07-04 03:00:00;3 seconds;shooting star ZIG ZAGS seaside oregon at all nighter beach bonfire in seaside oregon 4 years ago or so. while facing west towards the ocean, a SHOOTING STAR makes  Z from north to south. before i could say 'holy crap' it Zs back to the original position, backtracking south to north. i never saw the craft, just the atmosphere/plasma light.  brightness intensity was like a faint shooting star. i have seen a space shuttle re-enter the atmosphere in Texas.  that looked like magnesium burning.  this was faint. went across about 20 degrees of sky. i have heard meteors can 'bounce' off the atmosphere. this looked like pinball.;45.9937;-123.9243
