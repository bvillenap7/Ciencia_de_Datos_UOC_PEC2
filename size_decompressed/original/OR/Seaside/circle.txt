3 blue horizontal lights off the coast of Seaside (Gearhart);2011-03-23 22:00:00;1-2 mins;3 blue horizontal lights off the coast of Seaside (Gearhart) Since we do not have many clear nights during this time of year on the coast, I took my time to walk up my driveway.  As I approached my home I noticed 3 blue circles off the horizon (west).  They were faint but you could see them.  They were lined up (in my opinion) perfectly horizontal.   At first I could've sworn they were just stars, but they were too big and too close.  Then I didn't see any aircraft strobe lights blinking on them either.   I asked my friend if she could see what I was seeing, and she replied yes and that's really scary.  We stood there looking at them for a moment, and they just seemed to hover.  My view was somewhat obstructed by treetops, but could still see them.   I don't know what I saw, but I do know that it was not normal.  They were off the Pacific Ocean, I am 3/4 of mile inland from the beach.   After reading a recent report in the Yakima Herald (4/13/11) with a similar sighting, I felt I needed to report this.   I am a 33 year old male, I'v! e worked in the airline industry so I have some idea of what's out there at night and what to look for.

Red/Orange bright lights off Seaside Oregon Beach.;2012-07-15 22:00:00;15 minutes;Red/Orange bright lights off Seaside Oregon Beach. On the evening of July 15, 2012 at approx 10:30p I noticed a bright red/orange object out in the Pacific Ocean off the beach in Seaside Oregon.  I observed this from my home which is in the hills approx 3 miles east of the beach. I mentioned to my friend that it must be a planet as it is too big & bright to be a star.  It remained stationary for a few minutes then disappeared.  About 5 mins later I looked again and there were now two of the objects.  They seemed to appear and disappear without movement. I looked again after 5 mins and saw 4 of these objects in a perfect diagonal line which stayed stationary.  I then called the police dept to see if anyone else had reported the same sightings (no one had), and they put me through to the Coast Guard who took my information.  They seemed to move at this point before disappearing.;45.9937;-123.9243

I spot the very faint dark orange circular object moving at a good speed from North to South along Seaside Beach.;2015-08-07 10:00:00;<1 minute;A group of us were enjoying our bonfire at Seaside Beach, after our 2nd day of the annual beach volleyball tournament.   We were sitting in our chairs, I was playing with my green laser light to point to stars at the clear sky,  Then I spot the very faint dark orange circular object moving at a good speed from North to South along the beach, I pointed my green laser light at it to show people around me and others at the beach... It moved faster than a regular plane but very silent.  Within 30 seconds it was too far to follow with my green laser light.;45.9937;-123.9243
UFO leaves Earth through black hole portal.;2018-07-05 21:00:00;5 minutes;UFO leaves earth through black hole portal. Seaside Oregon July 5 2018, just before sunset I was at the Holiday Inn on the balcony taking pictures, it was a very photogenic day.   I noticed the sun was getting low in the sky and started getting my camera ready for a sunset.  As I looked through my camera, I saw a strange cloud low in the sky.   I had a mid-range zoom on the camera and zoomed in to look at the cloud.  I couldn’t believe my eyes!  In this cloud was a craft, clearly.   I took 2 photos of it and my settings were not getting the picture, see photo 1187.  Next to me on a table was my 300mm zoom.  I made the decision to go for the swap.  As I took the lens off, while keeping my eye on the cloud, the craft move out and away, up and right slightly.  Its movement was direct and smooth, it quietly and gracefully moved faster as it went, as it was getting smaller, due to moving away, suddenly it appeared to loop straight back on itself,  so for a moment I thought is was coming back and now had a very strange bright light on it.  Then I realized it had opened a portal- black hole and it was leaving.  The size of the portal was not much bigger than the craft.  This all took only seconds.   I reached for the 300mm lens, snapped it on and started shooting.  The first pics are of the UFO shaped cloud left by the craft and the black hole.  The black hole only shows up as a small strange cloud, although it was black in reality.  I was just amazed and disappointed in the photos and accidently deleted the second shot I took before changing lenses. Since then, I have poured over the photos and now realize, I really have something!  I may be the first and or only one to see this and photograph it.  Some of the photos are very high quality.  Nikon DX 5300 camera.  The UFO shaped cloud left by the craft dissipated in about 40 seconds and that is shown in the photo sequence.   I continued to shoot until it was gone.  On 11-14-18, I was looking at the time of the photos.  The time is not correct but it shows the rate I was shooting.  The photos numbered 1190, 1191 have a 4 minute 20 second gap.  I am positive I never stopped taking pictures for more than 20 seconds or so.     Then it occurred to me that the strange clouds that appeared next  (photo 1191) are part of the black hole and are measurable ( the distance stays the same from the gate to the clouds), consistent (there seems to be and energy making a twist) that stays  and then go away at the closing of the gate. 1.	  I have photos of a black hole, from a known fixed position with possible measurable data, which could locate the position of the gate.  The photos also show an effect from the gate starting with photo 1191, that affect seems to cause me too loose over 4 minutes.  The distance between the gate and weird cloud remains exactly the same distance until it closes.  It is my opinion that the ship was waiting for the gate.   Otherwise why would they risk this exposure?  2.	  What I witnessed in the gate is fairly interesting.  The light was like no other light I have seen, it is hard to describe.  But it was long and spikey, like a photo of star light but the spikes were bending and coming back to the gate.  Very bright and long spikes!  Photo 1188, when zoomed in shows the spikes.  The gate seemed straight at first and then after a while it curved left and the craft went left in the tube.  How I could see all of this is mysterious in itself.  How my camera didn’t get what I was seeing is disappointing. 3.	  The size of the craft was large, I am only guessing at 300 ft. in diameter.  Shiny and glistened in the sun.  But of a dark color, not bright and shiny like aluminum.   Deep enough for at least 2 decks.  Ironically no good photos of the craft.  Had I captured all of what I saw, this would have been one of the biggest UFO events in history. 4.	  I have forensically looked through all photos taken before the event.  All those being to the left of the place where I spotted the craft.  There are 2 possible UFO’s in photos 1138 and 1144 and I have a sequence of 5 photos showing 2 clouds dropping out of a larger cloud and moving right in the pictures, photos 1147 through 1154 on the right side above the tree and left.   Those might be clouds but they are going the right way and the craft was in a cloud so I included them. 5.	  There must have been a lot of people with cameras that day and many of those people may not know they have photos of this event. 6.	  Below is the basic shape, it was ugly enough to make me wonder if it was one of ours. Picture 1136 shows three black flying objects, on the far left above the mountain.;45.9937;-123.9243
