Brown crescent shaped lights seen flying over a Seaside Beach in Oregon.;2010-08-13 23:43:00;25 Seconds;Brown crescent shaped lights seen flying over a Seaside beach in Oregon. My boyfriend and I were going to watch the meteor shower that was supposedly taking place at midnight on Friday the 13th of August 2010.  We saw a few shooting stars and watched a couple of satellites go by and the both of us spotted this floating ball thing in the sky at exactly the same time.   We looked at it and realized there a ton more surrounding it. There had to have been at least 15 of these ball shaped lights all gathered in a crescent shape.  They were brown in color and there was no noise to be heard, so they weren't birds.  It wasn't a plane or a helicopter either.  It remained at a constant speed and it lasted for about 25 seconds.;45.9937;-123.9243
