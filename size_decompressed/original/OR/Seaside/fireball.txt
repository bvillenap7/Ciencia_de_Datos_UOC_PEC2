3 Fireball Looking Objects Seen Over Seaside, Oregon on the Evening of August 6th, 2011;2011-08-06 21:30:00;15 minutes;3 Fireball Looking Objects Seen Over Seaside, Oregon on the Evening of August 6th, 2011 At approximately 9:30pm Pacific time on August 6th, 2011, I was walking my dogs on the beach in Seaside, Oregon.  The temperature was in the low 60â€™s, the sky was relatively clear, with a patchy, thin layer of haze forming over the beach & town.  The wind was calm.  I had been looking at the sky because I was aware of the possibility of seeing the Northern Lights.  The sun had set & I was walking back towards my house.  When I got to the promenade at 12th street, I saw a man I had seen earlier.  I mentioned that the Northern Lights might be seen here tonight.  He was looking up at the sky & when I looked up I saw an object directly above us in the sky.  It was quite high.  There was a patchy thin layer of haze at approximately 3,000 feet & the object appeared to be much higher than that.  He asked me if I had seen the others & I said no.  I immediately thought it was something other than an aircraft, as I am a pilot & am familiar with the movement of various ! aircraft.  The object was quite bright with an orange glow.  It reminded me of a fireball.  It moved around almost like it was hovering & then the light began to fade.  It seemed as if it went straight up into the atmosphere.  There was no noise at all coming from the object that could be heard from the ground.  We were both in awe. As we were standing there talking about it, a couple & their son walked up from the beach.  We were still looking up at the sky & they asked us if we had seen anything.  When we said yes, they mentioned they had seen 2 other objects that had been flying in close proximity together.  The man I had been talking with had also seen the other 2.  I did not see them.  They had noticed them approximately 10-15 minutes prior while they were still on the beach watching the sunset.  The woman said she had seen them come up from the north over the Gearhart area at a rather high altitude & they emitted an orange glow.  They watched them head south & up to the same area as the 3rd one, which was directly overhead.  We joked around that they went to the mothership. I have always believed that other life forms existed.  Now I am even more confident in my belief.  It was truly an amazing opportunity.  I have no doubt that many other people on the beach tonight witnessed what we did.  I hope they will take the time to report what they saw.;45.9937;-123.9243
2 orange fireballs over Seaside, Oregon.;2015-04-22 21:30:00;2 minutes;2 orange fireballs over Seaside, Oregon. Sitting outside hotel room, when I saw 1 orange light in the sky hovering.  Another orange light seemed to have came up from behind the buildings.  It went up in the sky and hovered with the other one.  It seems that the first light was waiting for the second light.   The lights also seemed to dim and get brighter but in no certain pattern.  When the 2nd light met up with the 1st light, they went straight up and faded into the clouds.   The sky this night was partly cloudy, but they went into the clouds.  Earlier this day we also noticed jets flying in odd patterns which made me instantly question it.  They were making circles in the sky, 3 different contrails from commercial jets.;45.9937;-123.9243
Fast moving flame balls, heading SxSW at a clip faster than helicopters.;2016-04-16 21:43:00;3 minutes;Fast moving flame balls, heading SxSW at a clip faster than helicopters. Noticed a bright Orange flickering light HIGH in the sky above Seaside, OR.  Recorded a minute or so when I spun around to track it and noticed a second one over the ocean.  Looked identical and both were moving South by SW.  Faster clip than a helicopter or most planes.  Looked like flying fire:  flickering from Orange to Orange/White.;45.9937;-123.9243
