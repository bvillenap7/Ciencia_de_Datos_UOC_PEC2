Twin objects race across the sky in an unusal criss-cross pattern in an exciting sighting at the Oregon coast!;2003-08-16 23:00:00;approximate: 5 seconds;Twin objects race across the sky in an unusal criss-cross pattern in an exciting sighting at the Oregon coast! Saturday August 16th we were on the beach in Seaside Oregon star gazing. We had stayed out after watching a beautiful sunset and sitting in our sand chairs with perfect weather and an enjoyable evening. Sometime after 10:00 PM we both spotted what I would call a Fast-Walker, moving from south to north in a rapid long hopping or pulsing movement. Possibly with a reddish glow to it, brightening and dimming as it pulses forward through the sky. These are very fast and you can count four or five pulses as they skip across the sky in a matter of seconds and the they are gone from view. We actually saw two of these within an hour moving in a northernly direction.  Those were exciting and I had seen one once before but what we saw at approximately 11:00 PM really excited me! I pointed and yelled out UFO, UFO, as these two objects raced across the sky in a very unusal pattern. There was no doubt that these were very annomalus. There were two objects which my wife says were gray lights. I have trouble with colors and take her word for the color. All I can say is that there were two lights and that they were speeding north paralell to each other and appeared two come together and criss-cross each others path four to five times in a steady rythm as they rapiddly sped north from the south along the Oregon coast. Kind of hard to explain a sighting that only lasted about 5 seconds and I probably wouldn't have reported just a fast moving light in the sky like a pulsing Fast-Walker that allmost seems to be common, but these twin objects or lights were extraordinary. They appeared to be lower than the other objects we had seen. Yet very high with no known noise or visible trail associated with them and what struck me as almost a playful flight pattern, zipping in and out of each others path as they streaked along. It is possible that they were not criss-crossing but mearly appeared to come together and then part in a repeated pattern as they raced across the sky, but it was my impression that they were criss-crossing and traveling extremely fast in a very exciting, annomalous sighting. There were over 50 people on the beach and about seven campfires as we did a rough head count of the activities around us as we stayed out untill about midnight on this perfect summer evening on the beach. I don't believe anyone else heard me or looked up soon enough when I shouted UFO, UFO, probably muffled by the ocean surf and distance on the wide beach.;45.9937;-123.9243
Slow moving, multi-colored and unexplainable by me, a longtime resident. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible star?  PD));2009-09-15 20:00:00;1.5 hrs.;Slow moving, multi-colored and unexplainable by me, a longtime resident. At about 8:00 P.M.,my wife called me out on the porch to witness strange lights in the Northern sky.  To the naked eye, I noted it was about 30 degrees above the horizon,flickering in three distinct colors, and moving very slowly to the East.  We went inside, but returned to the porch about 30 minutes later, to find it not visible.  As we continued to sit on the porch, my wife noticed it was again visible.  We saw that it had moved horizontally only about 5 degrees in maybe 38 to 40 minutes.  I retrieved my digital camera and zoomed in on it.  What I saw were 8 to 10 lights of various sizes, some round, some irregular in shape.  I snapped a picture and the resulting image showed 2 lights, one above the other, the top one being larger than the bottom one. By this time, it was 9:30, and the lights became obscured by trees.  That was the end of my sighting, but I think I'll go down to the beach to see what else I can see.  If so, I'll get back to you. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible star?  PD));45.9937;-123.9243
White lights over Pacific Ocean.;2013-10-05 20:30:00;15 minutes;White lights over Pacific Ocean. While sitting outside on a clear night star gazing on Oct 5, 2013, at approx 8:30 pm, my fiance and I noticed a bright white light moving just above the horizon of the Pacific Ocean off of Seaside Oregon.  It was bigger & brighter than a star, planet, or satelite.  It disappeared.   We immediately noticed another white bright light to the south of the first light, however this one stayed stationary for some time.  We continued watching it until it lowered slowly, and was then behind Tillamook Head and out of our view.  I live about 2 mi from the beach at about 600ft and have seen lights in the same location a number of times.;45.9937;-123.9243

It looked like a very bright star except for time of day.;45.9937;-123.9243
Orange lights on coast.;2015-07-04 21:30:00;5 minutes;Orange lights on coast Two orange balls of light traveling south to north over land along the coast line.  No noise was heard and when observed with binoculars I could not make out any details other than the round shape.  Objects traveled identical paths but were a great distance apart.  Each object became faint and disappeared upon reaching same point directly east of my location.;45.9937;-123.9243
Two golden orange flashing lights hovering silently, moving slowly around.  ((anonymous));2016-04-17 21:20:00;10 minutes;Two golden orange flashing lights hovering silently, moving slowly around. A pair of sparkling orange lights, silently hovered and slowly moved over us.  As I walked around the corner, I lost visibility for 10 seconds.  When I saw them again, I saw one vanish in superspeed away in the night sky.  The other, still hovering and moving slowly above the area stayed around.  Got in my car and the light was still hovering the neighborhood as I drove off. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));45.9937;-123.9243
