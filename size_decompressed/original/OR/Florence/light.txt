Sighting of two brilliant orbs of light over ocean in Florence Oregon, August 2000;2000-08-06 23:00:00;2 hrs;Sighting of two brilliant orbs of light over ocean in Florence Oregon, August 2000 Just found this site as I was surfing the 'net (which was a fluke as I am not into UFO research or sightings as a hobby or anything.) Upon finding this I became curious, so I checked something out...and I was amazed to find a sighting similar to ours (in exact same location!) Therefore, I thought I should report this even though it happened almost four years ago. I didn't know what to with this information at the time but I'm thrilled to have found this site now and think such events should definitely be reported. While vacationing with my mate in Florence Oregon, August of 2000 (can't recall the exact day but I'm sure it was the first week of Aug) from our resort window - which was a perfect unobstructed view - we watched two extremely large, bright orbs hovering over the pacific ocean (very far out, probably thousands of miles, in the middle of the pacific.) They were too high to be ship lights and too active to be stars...they moved up and down, sometimes going quite high, sometimes hovering just above the water. We watched them through high powered binoculars as they shifted left, then right, then up and down. They would come closer and suddenly move a great distant away again at an extremely fast pace (in almost a flash.) I forgot to mention, one was a reddish orb, the other a green one and both approx. same size - although the green one seemed slightly smaller at times (maybe farther away?) Out of the brighter, reddish orb a smaller white glowing orb appeared to come out of it and circle around it, then float beside it for a time, then go back inside. We watched this happen for almost two hours when below on the beach, a man was walking alone and we watched him stop and observe the moving lights. (Maybe he saw them from his window also and went down to get a closer look.) Suddenly both of the massive lights went very high and just as quickly appeared to descend, then vanished - poof! (They appeared to have gone under the water.) We have never seen anything like this before nor sinc! e and are not UFO watchers. Needless to say this was quite unexpected! We assume it was probably some type of Gov. experiment/aircraft. Thanks! ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));43.991;-124.093
Strange Light in Coastal Sky;2006-08-17 22:30:00;8 to 9 minutes;Strange Light in Coastal Sky We observed a very bright light approach us from the SW.  The light did not waver as to intensity the entire time.  What was of concern was the manner of movement, it would move to the left and right, up and down.  At one point we saw the light come to a complete stop, move up and down then it proceeded on its orignal flight path.  This is the first time I have ever seen anything like this.  I am ex Military and Law Enforcement, I am pretty up on anything that flies.  This was moving like NOTHING I or the others present had ever seen.;43.991;-124.093
Red lights over Florence, Oregon;2011-09-25 21:00:00;2 minutes;Red lights over Florence Oregon Three bright red lights came in off the ocean and proceeded inland at a very fast speed.  Each light appeared about 30 seconds apart.  They proceeded inland until out of sight.  Went outside and objects did not make any sound.  Their flight was smooth and fast.

Two bright orange lights at the Oregon coast;2013-05-04 23:30:00;1;Two bright orange lights at the Oregon coast We were camping at the Oregon coast just south of Florence then we saw a bright orange light moving along the coast line from south to north.  At first we thought that it might be a plane, but then the light turned 45 degrees and started heading into the ocean.   What amazed me, that the light stayed very bright even though it was at least 20 miles from the coast. Just as soon as the light disappeared, there was a second light that looked exactly the same and followed the same path.

Until a distant light slowly with no sound made its way across the sky to ascend into the outer limits.  Not in a straight liner pattern like a satellite.   Another of the same loocking lights came from the other side of the sky.  Coming into view fading in as if it had entered the atmospher.  Traveling a much shorter distance than the last.   We witnessed a couple more short intervals, one even flashing or guiving off a quick burst of light. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible satellites.  PD));43.991;-124.093
Orange light silently passes overhead.;2019-10-01 01:00:00;5 seconds;Orange light silently passes overhead. Stepped outside to look at stars as I'm  a amuture astronomer. Unblinking soft orange light slowly passed overhead about 100 feet over my roofline. Went north to south till out of sight. No noise. Not plane or satellite.;43.991;-124.093
18 brite white lights traveling in a straight line east northeast.  ((NUFORC Note:  Starlink satellites?  PD));2019-11-25 06:00:00;2 minutes;18 brite white lights traveling in a straight line east northeast off the west coast of central Oregon At 6:00 AM I was taking out the garbage. When I looked up at the sky I saw two lights similar in appearance to stars moving east northeast across the handle of the big dipper. It was partly cloudy, with a large break of clear sky. When the two object disappeared from view to the east, I looked back to the west and saw more moving lights irregularly spaced but all in a straight line on the same heading east northeast. Two of the lights were side-by-side and one light had a much dimmer light traveling at itâ€™s side. The points of light were bright white at varying distances from each other and occasionally one or more would increase in speed momentarily. There were 18 to 20 of them all on the same heading, eventually traveling through the handle of the Big Dipper and then disappearing from view in the eastern sky. They were traveling much faster than a satellite, and much slower than a meteorite. The whole viewing event took appx. 2-3 minutes.;43.991;-124.093
