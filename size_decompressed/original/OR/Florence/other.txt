Dark dome shaped object over house.;2015-03-09 20:35:00;10 seconds;Dark dome shaped object over house. March 11, 2015 2035 pm Florence, Or 97439      We had just arrived home and were getting out of the vehicle when we spotted an object overhead. It was 40 degrees overhead moving on a south to north steady path.  Altitude was approximately 100-200' above us and it was the size of 4 full moons. The object was black in color, dome shaped on top with a flat bottom.  The dome area had what appeared to be louvers evenly spaced throughout and an antenna with a very bright white light at the top. The object made no noise and the light from the antenna left a small trail as it moved. We watched it for about 10 seconds and it dropped over the tree line out of sight. ((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken via telephone with the source of the report, and she seemed to us to be quite serious- and sober-minded.  We suspect that she and her grandson are quite reliable witnesses.;43.991;-124.093
