Pulsating light follows car 9 miles in Oregon;2001-11-15 23:30:00;9 Miles;Pulsating light follows car 9 miles in Oregon This is entered as reported to me from my girlfriend.  She was driving in my car along HWY 101 near Coos Bay Oregon at around 1130pm, this is her normal work commute.  She noticed a Bright pulsate white light above the car.  She looked a head of her and saw the object.  She then was under the object and directly beneath it. It was high in the sky but she had to close the moon roof due to the distracting light.  The object followed her for about 9 miles.  She could see the reflection of the pulsating light in the black paint of the car.  Then before she entered the outskirts of Coos Bay it disappeared, not flying off, but vanished.  No missing time was found just this odd sighting. ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witness observed that night, but our first suspicion is the planet, Jupiter.  It would be been very bright in the sky, and almost due south of the driver, I.e. directly ahead of and above her vehicle.  If there were not TWO bright objects in the sky, our guess would be she was being followed by Jupiter.  Many people have reported Jupiter and Venus to the National UFO Reporting Center.
