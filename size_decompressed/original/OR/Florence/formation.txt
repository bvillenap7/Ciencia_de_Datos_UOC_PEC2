I heard a big jet in the sky close by, so I looked up to see.  As I was watching the jet fly North, I saw a row of lights, 5 total,in a line, flying south.  It was either one long craft with 5 lights, or it was 5 different flying crafts flying in formation.  The object was not very high in the sky, and the lights were not bright, they were somewhat dim, like trying to he camouflaged.  The only sound I heard was from the jet plane flying North. I saw this same object, flying the same direction and flying this height about 4 weeks ago at 3:30am.;43.991;-124.093
