Continued burning until obscured by trees. We live 3 miles from Pacific Ocean.  Objects?, were moving at consistent speed entire time.  I can't  really quess the altitude, but was able to see a second object both times I focused on it.  Now sure the shape of second object but it was faintly illuminated, following closely below and slightly behind.  I initially thought this was a meteor slowly burning up, but it continued across the sky.;43.991;-124.093
Large fireball traveling from east to west at approximately 2:00, 0.5 mi from Florence, OR coast;2019-11-20 02:00:00;0.5 sec;Large fireball traveling from east to west at approximately 2:00, 0.5 mi from Florence, OR coast Unexpectedly awoke at approximately 1:50 and stayed in bed looking out west-facing window. Home approx 0.5 miles from the beach in a fairly dark neighborhood with no street lights. The milky way is visable on clear nights. Observed large fireball traveling from east to west at approximately 2:00, seemingly directly over the house. First instinct was to get up, put glasses on to see if it was a plane in flames (object likely moving to fast) or a meteor (very large) that had crashed. Unable to get out of bed for several minutes while attempting to rationalize sighting, perhaps due to fear. Once able to go to window, no further activity was observed (e.g., lights, fire). Nobody else in home, no reaction from dogs sleeping on upper level.;43.991;-124.093
