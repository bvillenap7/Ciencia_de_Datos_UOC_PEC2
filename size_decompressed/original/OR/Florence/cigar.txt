cigar shaped craft;1998-03-13 17:30:00;2 mins;I observed a cigar shaped craft sitting in the south-west sky about 40 degrees up. It didn't appear to be moving. I had the feeling it was a tourist craft. I went home to look at it closer with binoculars and seek other possible witnesses, but by the time I got home I forgot to look again.

Went on vacation in Florence Or. Driftwood II park. Bright cigar shape craft.  Looked like it was going to land on the beach. This was ;1999-07-01 15:00:00;5 seconds;Went on vacation in Florence Or. Driftwood II park. Bright cigar shape craft.  Looked like it was going to land on the beach. This was on July 1st. Around 15:00. Looked away for a second and it was gone. Went on vacation in Florence, Or.  My son and I were going down to the beach when I looked up and saw a bright cigar shape craft.  I thought that it was going to land on the beach.  It had contrails zig zagging behind it.  I looked up and it was the brightest looking craft.  I knew it was'nt a airplane right away.  In fact I thought that they were going to land and talk to people.  I have never seen one that close up.  I swear I only looked away for a second and it was just gone.  I thought when we got to the beach that people would be flipping out, but no one seemed to even have seen it.  Once again, I look like the crazy one.;43.991;-124.093
