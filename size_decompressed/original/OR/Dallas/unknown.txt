I had taken my dog outside to go to the bathroom and I looked up to the sky with it being a clear night and you can see lots of stars up there. I noticed one star in particular was zigzagging left to right and then right to left again at quick speed until it disappeared out of my sight. I think in all it was about 10 seconds or so. I was knocking on the back door to try to get my mom's attention to come out but she missed it.;44.9241000000001;-123.3248
