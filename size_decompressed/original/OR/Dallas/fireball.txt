Once We noticed it we focused in more trying to videotape and noticed what seemed to be multiple crafts blinking in different color sequences.  Blue/Red x2 and the Yellow/red one looked to be the biggest one and the others were blinking to the large one.  The large one spits out another small orb at high speed and it disappeared.  Came inside to find somewhere to report to see if anyone else is seeing this.  It is not 23:21 and te Large Red/Yellow is still there pulsating.;44.9241000000001;-123.3248
