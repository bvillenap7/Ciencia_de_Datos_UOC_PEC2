Buring orange sphere burning out over Salem Oregon;2005-01-04 19:15:00;10 min;Buring orange sphere burning out over Salem Oregon Myself and friends outside when we saw a bright orange in color sphere moving alround. Looked like the craft was in trouble unable to keep stable. It then looked like sparks where falling from it. Then it just vanished! Helicopters are now in the area.. and we have called the authorities and noone seems to know whats going on.;44.9241000000001;-123.3248
Large glowing orb that looks like a star from a distance but hovers 300 feet or so above tree line.;2014-12-03 21:45:00;3 minutes;Large glowing orb that looks like a star from a distance but hovers 300 feet or so above tree line. On our way driving to Dallas on Kings Valley Highway before the S-curves a mile before entering town, my buddy and I noticed a glowing orb 300 ft or so above the tree line.   When I first glanced at it I thought it was a star until I realized it was too big and too low to be one.  My next thought was a radio tower but the light was glowing yellowish gold and not red and there is no radio tower on top of that hill.   As my friend and I drove closer, the light went from 300 feet to to 75 feet or so above the ground in less than a second.  That's when we realized this was no ordinary object.   The light then instantly went to the ground and stopped moving.  The light moved too fast to be a helicopter and was too big to be a firework or flare.  After 4 or five seconds, the light moved to the left of the hilltop then shut off.   My friend and I drove home later that night and the light was no where to be seen.   During daylight you can see everything on that hill top where we spotted the light, and there is no tower or object that emits that color of light or moves that fast.;44.9241000000001;-123.3248
