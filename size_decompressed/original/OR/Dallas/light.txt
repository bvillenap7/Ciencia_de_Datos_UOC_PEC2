Very intense light, shone through covered windows, absolutely no sound, felt presence before observing.;2004-10-11 03:40:00;20 seconds;Very intense light, shone through covered windows, absolutely no sound, felt presence before observing. This was a bright light shining through the bedroom window, which changed in intensity, as if hovering, and moving back and forth.  There was no sound, and it is impossible for vehicle lights to shine through the window.  The light appeared to come from above the roofline, and shine in a downward motion.  It was very intense, penetrating the double fabric window covering. We woke up feeling a presence, then the light shone through, it was very penetrating.  In the morning, my husband commented he dreamt he had been poked with needles, and was moved from location to location before the incident.;44.9241000000001;-123.3248
