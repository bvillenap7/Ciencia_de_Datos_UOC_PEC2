Bright light seen near Mars, descended rapidly.;2003-11-26 18:31:00;30 seconds;Bright light seen near Mars, descended rapidly. At 6:31 pm local time in the clear SW night sky I was looking at the ascention of Mars, when I noticed a white light in the proximity of Mars.  It was 1/3 the size of Mars and was below it.  The color was bluish white, and could have been a star at this point.  However, the light began to descend at a controlled rate, too fast for aircraft and too slow for a meteor.  There was no vapor trail or comet tail.  I could not discern if the object was in Earth atmosphere or not.  It became obscured by some trees after it had descended for several seconds.  It never changed size or color while I observed it for 30 seconds or so.;45.8551;-123.1922
