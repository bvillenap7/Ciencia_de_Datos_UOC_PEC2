Early morning traveling to work entering Hwy 211 from Trubel Rd to head south/west.  I could see 2 red orbs traveling very slowly towards Sandy (east) towards Mt Hood.  They were under a low cloud ceiling.   There were other vehicles traveling around the area that had to see them also.  They were traveling the opposite way of me.  I should have turned around to follow but headed into work.  It just another ufo sighting!  :);45.3788;-122.2215
