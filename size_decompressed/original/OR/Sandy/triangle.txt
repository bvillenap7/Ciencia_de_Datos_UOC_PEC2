Huge flashing lights hovering overhead of the city every night;2020-07-16 22:10:00;All night;Huge flashing lights hovering overhead of the city every night These V-shaped lit up along edges of the v shape are in a constant hovering over all of night sky directly over Sandy Oregon from all directions. They have been up in night sky for many months now since before the GOVERNOR BROWNâ€™S ATTEMY TO LOCK US ALL DOWN!!!  These objects seem to acknowledge your presence and will come down over the top of you and or your Home and fly over at very low elevation overhead!  They are very loud when passing over and yet very slow when passing overhead!!! I can video tape and take photos of these objects and when O have lightning outside changing colors as they do constantly it seems to make them REACT In a very curious manner like when my HOTTUB lights are changing colors that brings them right down from high elevation to cruise right overhead!!!  Incredible and there is a bunch of bright flashing lights as well during this orbit hovering they do and a small round ORB like objects that come ahead of the HUGE triangle flying OBJEC! TS that are in a constant watch over all neighborhoods. Not sure what they are but they can be very aggressive toward us.;45.3788;-122.2215
