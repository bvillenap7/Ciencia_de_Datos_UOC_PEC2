One large object not emitting any light action was also what they were going to and fro as well all within the skies toward East skies over Sandy Oregon near the right of the Big Dipper handle constellation. These objects can be seen in all parts of the skies over town as soon as you can see them when sun has set and skies are dark you can see them every night. Last few weeks they are thick since the heavens are so quiet with the airplanes decrease due to the FEAR‚Äù!!! Of COVID 19! Incredible how our skies are so active with these busy working objects above all o! f this territory.;45.3788;-122.2215
