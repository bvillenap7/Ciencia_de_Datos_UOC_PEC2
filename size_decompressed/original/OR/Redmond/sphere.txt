Then it moved from point A to point B in the blink of a eye. From our perspective it was about 20 feet, which must have been allot of miles. It stayed in that spot for a few second and was gone. To me it looked more like a shinning dot than a sphere. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and he sounded quite credible to us.  PD));44.2762;-121.1847
Small, white, lumenescent sphere observed drifting through chemtrail activity from High Desert, Central Oregon.;2012-09-29 12:00:00;30 minutes;Small, white, lumenescent sphere observed drifting through chemtrail activity from High Desert, Central Oregon. small (estimating the altitude @ a few thousand feet HIGHER than normal chem-trail activity and this sphere was presenting aproximately 1-2cm diameter), white on a blue field sky - hazy orangish lumenescence when it played through a fair sized and expanding chem-trail emission feathery dot. Noticed as I sat on the deck this day, it traversed a path E-S maybe 2-3 miles (slow easy lazy hover with steady drift).  Pointed this out to 2 other adults to make sure it wasn't just my eyes. Both confirmed the presence and neither had an explanation.  This is the 2nd time this month I have observed this craft.  Other time was on a late afternoon early in September or late August.;44.2762;-121.1847
Glowing orange spheres over Redmond, Oregon.;2013-11-22 01:00:00;10 minutes;Glowing orange spheres over Redmond, Oregon. Approximately 1:00 am:   3 orange glowing spheres.  Thought at first they were seasonal decorations, floating approximately 20' above a house.   As we approached in our vehicle, it started to float slowly up like a balloon, then propelled northbound at incredible speeds.   We immediately saw another sphere up the road that was also hovering about 20' above another home.  A smaller orange glowing light was dropped onto the house before the sphere departed in a similar matter.   Third craft was seen on our way home when we decided to go inside.;44.2762;-121.1847
