4 red/orange circle/sphere/orb like coloured lights in the sky on a very clear night;2015-03-08 20:45:00;1-3 minutes;4 red/orange circle/sphere/orb like coloured lights in the sky on a very clear night Approximately at 8:45pm I stepped outside to shut our back door and make sure none of our dogs were outside before closing down the house for the night, I looked up in the sky noticing 4 red/orange round orbs/circles (regular balloon size) from where I was on my back porch (Redmond, Oregon, heading West towards Sisters, Oregon).   I yelled for my mother and aunt that were there in the living room to come out to see if they saw what I was looking at.  We all confirmed the exact same sighting.  By the time my mother stepped outside she saw three then by the time my aunt stepped outside she saw two they took off into the night sky and were gone completely with a blink of an eye and then nothing. We immediately called 911 to see if anyone had reported the sighting, they said NO, we asked if any military operations were going on they said NO (we asked these questions because we live near the Redmond Airport) they did asked what direction the orbs traveled to, where I continued to explained exactly what I mentioned in the first paragraph (coming from the north heading east toward Sisters, Oregon, area.  They asked if we wish to send a police unit out to our home but we told them no need to due to the fact that we no longer saw the red orb/circle lights in the sky at the time of talking with the police department.   The police department suggest we call the UFO Government hotline number (206-722-3000).  I spoke with Mr. Peter Davenport who asked me to put down everything I saw in writing and to contact the radio, press, television, newspaper and to go the website UFOCENTER.COM to report everything that we saw this evening.  Date Sunday March 8, 2015, (Mr. Peter Davenport  asked that we document everything I saw this evening before going to the website). The entire incident was over within 1-2 minutes. We contacted our local newspaper 03/09/15 the next morning to see if anyone had reported what we saw.  They sent us over to a gentlemen that takes reports for sightings in the night sky and we left a voice message and are waiting to hear back.;44.2762;-121.1847
UFO Redmond, Oregon, August 2, 2020. West of Forked Horn Butte;2020-08-02 09:57:00;Unknown;UFO Redmond, Oregon, August 2, 2020. West of Forked Horn Butte Husband and I were working on front of home when I noticed fabulous looking linear clouds to west so I took a bunch of pictures.  We live on top of Forked Horn Butte and clouds or vapor trails were directly west of Butte.  I got some great pictures and two of the pictures you can clearly see a round, metallic looking craft with dark underside.  They are pictures so I didnâ€™t observe craft moving.  My main interest was the clouds and I got lucky and photographed what appears to be a ufo.;44.2762;-121.1847
