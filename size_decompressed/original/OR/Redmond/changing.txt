It slowley moved down in the sky and then away from us till out of sight.  Looking through binoculars you could make out a cluster of shimmering lights, we think four.  We also watched this the night before.  I talked to Mr Davenport on the hotline.  The night before there was a cloud cover at 4,000ft.  This night it was clear.;44.2762;-121.1847
