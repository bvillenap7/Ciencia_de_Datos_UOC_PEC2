My husband and I were traveling from Sisters to Redmond on Mckenzie HWY / HWY 126.  My husband caught the UFO on video at 8:46 PM. It was dusk and there were no stars visible, yet.  We noticed a bright white glowing light over the hill ahead of us .  It began to fluctuate, yet appearing stationary.  It then dropped in altitude horizontally behind a huge hill. We lost sight of it for a few minutes while going around trees and buildings.  As we entered town it was much lower in the sky, not far over the buildings . It seemingly sat at a steady altitude moving slightly from side to side.  We lost sight again, heading through town. We looked all over for it and after we got to the East side of Redmond where we would surely be able to see, there was nothing.  After reviewing the videos my husband took it appears to be an oval shape emitting light.;44.2762;-121.1847
