Shimmering brilliant light darting and hovering in horizon above butte in Redmond, OR.;2007-03-14 21:00:00;hour;Shimmering brilliant light darting and hovering in horizon above butte in Redmond, OR. While on our back deck this evening, my daughter and her boyfriend saw a light in the horizon that was very bright and shimmering different colors.  They saw it move about quickly then hover...they called me out to see it. They said it appeared to be shooting off lights.  My younges daughter and I also witnessed this brillant light dart`to the right then sit still. We could see several aircraft pass directly above and below the light. It continued to move about in the same approximate place but slowly seemed to fade and became difficult to see due to trees--it seemed to be moving toward Sisters, OR.  An hour later we couldn't see it anymore nor the top of the butte we live on that had seemed to be illuminated by it.  I did call the local police and reported it....they said they will check it out.;44.2762;-121.1847

Orangish red pulsating light over Sisters/Redmond, Oregon.;2014-08-11 23:00:00;5 minutes;Orangish red pulsating light over Sisters/Redmond, Oregon. Myself and 3 other neighbors saw a strange pulsating orangish red light to the west of us as it moved slowly across the sky, looked to be above sisters oregon,  watched it for about 5 minutes and then it disappeared,  i assume it went into the clouds, but then about an hour later at around 11 pm pst it appeared again ,  i called my neighbors out and we watched it again but this time as it went slowly across the sky looked like it emitted 2 white orb looking balls of light from the top and bottom of the orangish red pulsating light and these orbs shot up and down from top and bottom and then disappeared , strangest thing i have ever seen but afterwards, the orange/red light continued north and the it too disappeared about the same spot the first time seeing it.  i tried to get a video of it but camera wouldnt work in the dark and there was no noticeable noise like from a heli or plane, completely quiet;44.2762;-121.1847
Unusual bright object, visible during mid-day bright blue sky.;2015-07-27 13:00:00;1 hour;Unusual bright object, visible during mid-day bright blue sky. At about 13:00 on July 27, 2015, I observed a very bright light through 10 power binoculars.  It was about 20 degrees east of the sun.   Sky conditions were cloudless with a brilliant blue sky.   I discovered it while following an airliner flying overhead from North to South trailing a contrail.  The object was not visible with the naked eye.   The object was stationary and visible for over an hour.  It had a shape like a small quarter moon.  I initially thought it might be Venus but could find no Internet reference stating that Venus would be visible during daylight.  Nor could I find any Internet reference to any object visible during daylight.   My wife observed and confirmed my observation.;44.2762;-121.1847
Hovering flashing light over Sister's Mountains.;2016-03-31 00:21:00;15 minutes;Hovering flashing light over Sister's Mountains. Woke up feeling agitated and was drawn to look outside.  When I looked west I saw a flashing red light very low on the horizon.  It appeared to hover between the north and south Sister's mountains.  It was too low to be a plane and it was stationary.   I began to pray and ask for protection from Jesus.  The flashing lights stopped and it became a steady white light, that grew dimmer and dimmer.  The next two nights I have looked in the same area and have not seen anything similar.;44.2762;-121.1847
