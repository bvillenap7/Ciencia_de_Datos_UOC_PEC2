small disc shape object with dark orange glow underneath;2004-03-12 21:30:00;2 minutes;small disc shape object with dark orange glow underneath I was outside on my back deck relaxing in my hottub when I noticed something moving across the sky about 500 feet above ground. Expecting this object to turn out to be a plane (since a small airport is nearby)did not..I got out of my hottub to get a better look since my field of vision was going to be blocked..there was no sound of an engine, and a strange dark orange glow underneath the object..passing above ground I would say about 500 feet..traveling in a west to east and not going very fast, Either there was enough light coming from aboveground to light its underbelly, or the object itself was eminating the glow,..There were no flashing lights or any airplane or jet sound, just what seemed to be circular in nature, this object was flying close enough that if it were a plane, I would have heard an engine sound or the sound of the wind had it been a plane gliding into land. \ Something was very different about this, enough so to make me get out of my hot tub and stand in my backyard in my birthday suit to check it out!!  I watched the object until it was out of my field of vision from where I was in my backyard (about 2 minutes.) It was not headed toward our airport in any normal flight pattern that I have observed (& flown myself) for a landing at the airport (redmond airport).;44.2762;-121.1847
