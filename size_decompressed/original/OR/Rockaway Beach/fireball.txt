Erratic flight patterns. We were staying up late to ring in the new year.  While looking at the stars, we all saw a few tiny orange lights in the sky.  They flew erratically and were bright orange in color.  Two flew south and disappeared immediately, while one took some time before getting smaller and vanishing.  Two more could be seen in the distance.;45.6135;-123.9486
