Weird lights over Oregon Coast;2001-03-21 19:50:00;3-4 min.;Weird lights over Oregon Coast We witnessed one craft in front of the other 3 that was very large with white lights it seemed to be leading the other 3. They where bright red constant lights. They had no formation, as we watched they sped up and slowed down passing each other. However they all seemed to be going the same speed. They never caught up to or passed the large craft in front. They traveled full view from the southeast sky and traveled to the north. After they had traveled about 15 miles they where still in view till they went behind a mountain. Weirdest thing I have ever seen... never experience something this weird before.;45.6135;-123.9486
