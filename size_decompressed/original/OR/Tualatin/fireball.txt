Fireball sighting on Halloween night;2006-10-31 19:10:00;30 seconds;Fireball sighting on Halloween night Walking home while trick-or-treating a few houses from ours, we were in the street.  I, my son and his friend, saw a spherical object (about the size of a basketball) coming down from the sky over the trees (which are over 100 feet tall).  It was twirling and on fire.   After putting the kids in the house with a friend, I went into the golf course to see if I could see any fire in the field behind the neighborhood. There was no fire, but this is wetlands.  Another trick-or-treater saw the ball from a different spot in the neighborhood.  It seemed like it would have hit the ground behind the houses with this direction.  Too high to have been thrown.  Could've been a comet fragment.;45.3716;-122.7656
