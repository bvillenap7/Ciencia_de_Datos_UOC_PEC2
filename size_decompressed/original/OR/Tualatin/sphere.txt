Looked up, as spouse and I were returning to our house after a walk in the late dusk (9:40pm), to see a reddish sphere in the southeastern sky, nearest to Altair in the Summer Triangle.   It was still, not moving for a few seconds (which caught my eye, because usually planes with red lights move, and the lights flash), then it moved ever slightly, then held still for a few seconds, then went dark suddenly. We watched for several minutes and never saw it reappear.  No sounds, no other lights or movement detected.  Because it was dusk, we only saw a reddish light.  It didn't appear to our naked eye that there was more than one light.;45.3716;-122.7656
