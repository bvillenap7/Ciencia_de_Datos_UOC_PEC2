Oregon UFO sighting;2002-06-15 00:45:00;4 seconds;Oregon UFO sighting I was leaning against my car, talking to my friend when behind him I saw an oblong lookin shape surrounded by a bright red light travelling at a very high velocity parallel with the horizon.  The object passed behind some trees then continued from behind the trees for about two seconds then vanished.  It left no trail, made no noise, and moved extremely quickly.  By the time my friend turned around the object had vanished, but he saw that I was visibly shaken.  I really hope someone else saw this one, cause it really freaked me out.;45.3716;-122.7656

2 Star looking objects observed in Tualatin, OR;2008-05-17 15:00:00;10 - 15 min;2 Star looking objects observed in Tualatin, OR UFO sighting in Tualatin OR on 5/17/08, in the afternoon sometime…3:00 ish or so?  After exiting a store in the Tualatin area, I was walking to my car in the parking lot and a very bright light in the northern sky caught my eye.  It was a warm sunny day with only a few vapor trails in the sky – no real clouds.  I then noticed two bright star-like lights in the sky, to the north of the parking lot area.  They appeared to be high in the sky, but slightly lower than jets would normally fly.  They were moving very strangely at right angles and seemingly together.  The lights were bright white and very bright.  I observed their movements for what seemed like 5 minutes or so and I then noticed an older couple leaning over their SUV and the man was looking through binoculars in the direction of the UFO’s.  I went over to the couple and we watched the lights for about 10 minutes or so more.  He said he could see fluorescent green lights on the lower half of the oval object.  He stated that it appeared to have a metal appearance.  He said “those are NOT airplanes!”  Then one of the lights went behind the large vapor trail and we lost sight of it, while one of the lights proceeded to move to the right side of the vapor trail.  Then we lost sight of that one too.  We then noticed about 5 jets heading from different directions all going in the same direction/location and at about the same height in the sky of where we saw the lighted objects. Strange….;45.3716;-122.7656
