It was a pretty big, much bigger than a star.  It was circular shape and was completely white with faint colors trailing after it.  (The colors were a mix of purple, pink, blue, and green.  Maybe a little bit of yellow or orange.)  It appeared out of thin air and was moving in a straight line for around 2-3 seconds.  Maybe 4 seconds but I doubt it.  It disappeared after a few moments.;45.3716;-122.7656
