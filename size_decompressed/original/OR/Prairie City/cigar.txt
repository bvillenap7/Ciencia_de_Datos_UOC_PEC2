My husband I were traveling down a grade on U.S. 26, in a S.W. direction above the John Day Valley at about 3800 ft.and about 5 miles above Prairie City. The Strawberry Mountains(9038 ft.) were in front of us. It was just past sunset and the sky was still blue and we could see what appeared to be a jet with a short vapor trail, about 5 - 10 degrees above and to the southwest of the mountain.  We exclaimed about the jet, but decided it was not a jet as it looked more like a comet with large amounts of vapor coming off in a fan shape from what appeared to be the front of it.  We pulled over and remarked again about WHAT IS THAT!  Then got our binoculars out from behind the seat but before we could get the lens caps off...it disappeared!  The time was 7:08 (was this connected to the missle launch from California?) ((NUFORC Note:  The time is the same as the launch of a Minuteman II from Vandenberg AFB, but that missile flew to the west.  We received another report from an engineer in Tracy, CA, who reported that he and his son witnessed an object, with a prominent ablation cone, flying due north.  We do not know what that object was.  See report for this date.));44.4592;-118.6952
