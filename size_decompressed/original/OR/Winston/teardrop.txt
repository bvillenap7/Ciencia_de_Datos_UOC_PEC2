Large, green fireball like object;1998-09-23 21:00:00;2 seconds;Large, green fireball like object. Around 9:00 p.m., I saw the strange green fireball streak down and west just below Polaris.  Object appeared to have possible whiter color twards center, also appeared to completely fade out at least two times.  Object was about half the apparent size of a full moon, maybe slightly larger.  I have witnessed many meteors and seen my share of large fireballs.  This object's light was 'sharp' around the edges.  Seem to recall a short trail, not like a meteors' train, however.  One again, object was sighted about 10 degrees below Polaris and slightly east, and moved down and west twards the 7 O'clock position.  Seemed to continue beyond horizon.  Clear sky, visibility >10 miles;43.1037;-123.4373
