Bright, green fireball;1998-09-23 21:00:00;2 seconds;Bright, green fireball Object fell like a  typical meteor, but was bright and sharp like a welding arc.  Moved down and left looking north, just below Polaris.  Object blinked perfectly in and out at least 3 times.  Seemed almost like another color twards center, maybe whitish. Possible short train behind object.   Also, would like to add, just over one year ago, a friend and myself watched a diamond-shaped object in a valley near here for 2.5 hours, during intense thunderstorm.;43.1037;-123.4373
It was a very bright glowing white light traveling from east to west at a high rate of speed.  ((NUFORC Note:  Overflight of ISS.  PD));2015-06-14 22:00:00;5 minutes;My girlfriend and I were sitting on the porch.  It was a clear night with no clouds or haze in the sky.  She pointed to a bright light way out on the west horizon that seemed to be moving.   I grabbed my binoculars to get a better look at it.  I continued to watch it thru my binoculars, as it traveled across the sky. It was a very bright glowing white light traveling from east to west at a high rate of speed. It maintained it's speed, elevation, and direction.  It appeared to be traveling at a lower elevation then what commercial aircraft travel at.  About 1 minute after it passed overhead, it changed into an orange color and then faded out. I have been in the Air Force for 18 years.  I have spent a lot of years working on aircraft.  I have been around many different aircraft, from cargo to fighters.  I can distinguish between an airplane, satellite, and meteor.  It was none of these.
