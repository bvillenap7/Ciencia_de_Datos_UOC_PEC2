On my way to Lewiston Idaho on Wednesday the 26th of November, I was driving along the Columbia River and saw a bright yellow light move past me going Eastward.  I was about 21 miles East of The Dalles, Oregon and I was going about 85 or 90 mph. A light passed above me and was going at least twice my speed. I could see the reflection of the light on the river. I thought it was just a plane, but I rolled down the window and couldn't hear anything.  All of a sudden it seemed to just stop and went North, towards Washington. It was really spooky.;45.5998999999999;-121.187100000001
