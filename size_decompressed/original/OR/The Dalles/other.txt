Looking and moving like flying saucer right out of science fiction. Mid afternoon, sunny day.  Smallish craft, maybe the size of a mid-to full sized RV?  Bright reflective silvery shimmering surface, wedge shaped.  About 200 feet from shore, maybe only 500-1000 feet above the Columbia River.  It suddenly arrived, hovered briefly, then flew off extremely quickly.  Looked as if there was another one high up in the sky, hovering for a while above.  I have operated small drones.  This did not look like, nor move like any drone I have ever seen.  No apparent sound, silent running.;45.5998999999999;-121.187100000001
