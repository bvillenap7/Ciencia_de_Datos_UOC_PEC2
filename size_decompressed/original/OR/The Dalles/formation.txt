Formation of 5 ufos sighted over The Dalles, Oregon.;2014-04-30 21:50:00;10 minutes;Formation of 5 ufos sighted over The Dalles, Oregon. We were outside on the patio when my daughter alerted me to a formation of stationary lights to the southeast.  They were in a zigzag pattern all equally distant from each other.    The one at the bottom of the formation was much larger with a flashing red light in the center and flashing white lights on each side.  The smaller ones had red flashing lights only.  At first they were flashing in a pattern to each other then the large one began to move to a higher altitude and toward the Northwest.  The smaller lights lined up and seemed to escort the larger one.   One sped up to the front, one went to the side with the last two tightly following.  They moved very fast, staying in the same formation until they were out of our sight.;45.5998999999999;-121.187100000001
Straight line of white blinking lights headed N, such as a scrolling led sign. ((NUFORC Note:  Space Link satellites.  PD));2019-05-25 23:00:00;20 minutes;Straight line of white blinking lights headed north, such as a scrolling led sign. Was like nothing I have ever seen before. The lights continued to 'roll' through the sky in a straight line for nearly 20 minutes before ending. It was easily 40 miles long. Not a small or insignificant event.
