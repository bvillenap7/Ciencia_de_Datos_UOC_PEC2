spherical shaped object that appeared to be white with a grey shadow flying north to south;2005-03-30 14:00:00;approx 2 minutes;I observed a spherical shaped object that appeared to be white with a grey shadow flying north to south between the Columbia River and Eagles Caves over The Dalles. It flew from the Caves towards Sorosis Park.   It was a very windy day but this object flew perfectly straight without ever moving up or down or changing speed.  I watched it until it went out of sight.  I was not sure if it dissappeared, landed or where it went.   At first I thought it was a balloon but after watching it for a few minutes I realized that a balloon would be all over the place in that high of wind, the object appeared to stay perfectly in mid air with the wind not having any effect on it.
