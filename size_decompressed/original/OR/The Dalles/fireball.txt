I watched it for approximately 90 seconds when it left my line of sight through the window. At that time I went to wake my father for him to see it, but he would not wake. Orange fireball with a streaming tail approximately 4 times the length of the body. It moved slowly through the sky from west to east.;45.5998999999999;-121.187100000001
2 witnesses to a large orange fireball object flying upwards into the atmosphere;2011-09-11 00:00:00;30 seconds;2 witnesses to a large orange fireball object flying upwards into the atmosphere Late last night when I was driving around with my boyfriend, we witnessed a fireball looking thing fly above us. It seemed to of been flying at a very fast speed, upwards into the atmosphere.  It was orange and when compared to the almost full moon last night, it looked like it was about 1/4 the size of the moon.  We weren't drinking or anything, we did not have any drugs in our system, never have. We both were freaked out by what we had both witnessed.  My sister believes that it was a shooting star from my description, but to me that sounds nothing like what it looked like..  It was too large and orange to be a shooting star.  And it was traveling upwards.. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));45.5998999999999;-121.187100000001
Yellow and greenish fireball streaking to the west over north central Oregon.;2013-07-25 00:26:00;3-4 seconds;Yellow and greenish fireball streaking to the west over north central Oregon On Thursday morning, 25 July 2013, at approximately 00:26 PDT, I witnessed a fireball travelling west and slightly south from my location on the east side of The Dalles, Oregon. It began in the east-south-east, to the east of the moon, near the lowest star in Pegasus and streaked mainly to the west, disappearing just west of due south.  It went under the moon about three quarters of the distance above the horizon as compared to the moon.  I could not tell if it was heading due west and just losing altitude, or if it was actually moving somewhat to the south. The streak itself appeared to have a yellow/gold center with trailing sparks, but the outsides or borders of the streak above and below had a green tint to them.  The streak terminated without any discernable report, either visual or aural.  It just disappeared at a point estimated at an elevation about one half the distance from the horizon to the moon, but well west of the moon, between Sagittarius and Aquila. The entire streak lasted an estimated 3-4 seconds. The length of the streak was considerable, probably consisting of as much as a quarter or even a third of the total length that it travelled in the sky. My best guess is that this was a meteor, not any type of craft.;45.5998999999999;-121.187100000001
A bright ball to the right of mt hood (south west of here) coming closer and becoming brighter, 0.2 inches at arms length.  ((re-entry);2021-03-25 21:15:00;1 minute;A bright ball to the right of mt hood (south west of here) coming closer and becoming brighter, 0.2 inches at arms length.  We saw a cloud forming behind it as it traveled from sw to ne.  Directly west it was at 10 o'clock in the sky, about a foot long, many large, bright chunks and smaller bright pieces like many sparklers.  Looked like ATV-1 re-entry on Youtube.  Was still buring up when it reached the far horizon.;45.5998999999999;-121.187100000001
