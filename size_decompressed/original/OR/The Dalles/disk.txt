Large disk above town moving slowly away;2020-02-06 17:30:00;10 seconds;Large disk above town moving slowly away My twelve year old son was in our backyard when he looked out over our town to the North (we live on a hill) and saw a disk on edge that was about 4 inches across at arms length and seemed to be 2-3 miles away, 500 to 1000 feet above the town, silently moving slowly away to the North.  The side he saw was light in shade but had dark vertical stripes narrower than his fingers.  He ran excitedly inside after looking at it to tell my wife but she was on the phone with me â€“ I was at a hardware store and I knew what time it was from that.  At the time it was fairly dark and cloudy.  The object was gone when he went back to look at it.;45.5998999999999;-121.187100000001
