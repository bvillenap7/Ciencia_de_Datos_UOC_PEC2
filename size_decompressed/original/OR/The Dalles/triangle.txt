Then it started moving toward our house and it passed over moving very slow, slower than a small plane. It was triangle in shape with lights and it was without sound, it went right over the top of me. I watched it until it disappeared over the hill behind my house. The man from Kirkland, WA saw the same thing I did only I saw it years ago. I have seen about five sightings, each one different and they weren't balloons.;45.5998999999999;-121.187100000001
Triangle shaped with lights moving slowly, no sound;1990-06-01 21:00:00;20 minutes;Triangle shaped with lights moving slowly, no sound I was watching what I thought was a helicopter hovering over an electrical substation above one mile or less from my front yard. I watched and watched and it didn't move but stayed where it was for approximately 20 minutes, then moved very slowly to the northwest. It was triangle shaped with lights all around, white, red and green lights, it was not a helicopter nor was it an airplane. It went straight over the top of me standing in my front yard, thee was zero sound. It moved slowly until it disappeared over the hills. I had heard before of aircraft-like visitors hovering above the substations but that was first one I had seen. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is uncertain.));45.5998999999999;-121.187100000001
Stationary grounded object north of Dallesport, Wash. Bright silver in sunlight.;2001-08-30 19:00:00;20 minutes;Stationary grounded object north of Dallesport, Wash. Bright silver in sunlight. Not a flying object, but grounded stationary on top of mountain range immediately north of Dallesport, Wash., southern Klickitat County, visible as bright sunlit reflection from The Dalles, Ore. (to south across Columbia River). I noticed object because of the glint of sunlight, and viewed it through binoculars because I am familar with terrain and did not know of any road reaching that point. Object located on summit of range in very rugged terrain. I have since checked on maps and can find no road to location. Object was still very distant even with binoculars, but looked like a large silver, triangular structure, much too big for a tent. I attempted to set up a spotting telescope, but by the time this was in place the object was no longer visible. I'm curious whether any other sightings of anything unusual this time and location. ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION)) ...I've been familiar with your organization for a long time. I haven't reported this earlier because I've been trying to decide where to go with it: I planned to hike to the site initially, but Sept. 11 came soon after and I had my hands full getting my job done.  But the sighting has been nagging at me, and I still plan to hike up there to see if I can find any imprints before the spring grass starts to grow.  (The area is upland pasture -- very few trees). When I checked the site through my spotting scope after whatever had been there was no longer there, I noticed a small plane crossing east to west close to the hillside -- the plane was closer to my vantage point than the object had been, but even so the plane was very, very tiny through the spotting scope. Yet the object had been relatively larger, even though farther away.  This means it had to have been at least as large as a trailer or small house. Yet no roads up there to bring in a trailer, and houses don't vanish within the space of an hour. If I do hike into the area, I'll let you know what I find out. Ditto if there's anything in the ((deleted)). Best regards,  ((name deleted));45.5998999999999;-121.187100000001
