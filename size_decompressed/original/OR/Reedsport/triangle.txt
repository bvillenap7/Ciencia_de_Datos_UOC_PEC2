Hovering object above the trees, with strobe like lights;2007-05-09 04:25:00;5 min;Hovering object above the trees, with strobe like lights I was taking my boyfriend to work about 25miles away I do this every morning at 4:20am. I drive this road every morning…every morning.  	This morning we happened to see something we have never seen before. I was driving so I didn’t get as good of a look as he did. But it was definitely weird. The road we take is Highway 101 its trough a really wooded area. We happened to be he only car on the road this time. When I cam around the corner I saw this strobe light looking thing. I was just kidding and I said, “Ooh look it’s a space ship” totally just kidding. When we got closer we got more freaked out.  	My boyfriend isn’t a very gullible guy and he was more freaked out then I was. Like I said we have drove this road a million time I know there are no electrical towers or anything, like that around. It looked like a triangle shaped something hovering right over the tips of the trees. And it had like 3 halogen colored lights that were flashing really slow like a strobe light. You couldn’t take your eyes off of it. We didn’t stop though for one we were scared and two he couldn’t be late for work.  	On my way home though nothing was there. I’m not an alien freak or anything, honestly I never really believed in that kind of stuff. But really there is no other explanation. We haven’t event told anyone cause no one we would know would believe us. I don’t know it’s going to be one of those things that we will always remember, wishing we had stopped.;43.7055;-124.0935
