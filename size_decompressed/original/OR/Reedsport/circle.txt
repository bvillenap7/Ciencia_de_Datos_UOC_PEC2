I was driving up a hill and noticed a semi truck on the right with his flashers on.  Then, coming down the hill was a car blinking his/her brights at me when at the exact time I looked up and saw a HUGE blue light blinking and circling in the sky.  It was at tree level and then disappeared into the trees.  I know it was not a plane because it could not fly that low, and have that huge of light.  It really was odd and scary at the same time!  But, I'm positive the other cars saw this otherwise they would not of been blinking there lights at me. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.
