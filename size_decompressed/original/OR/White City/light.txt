Red light that seemed to drop falling embers over White City, Oregon;2008-12-22 21:00:00;6 minutes;Red light that seemed to drop falling embers over White City, Oregon I saw a bright red light in the Eastern sky, about 1 mile from my home.  I thought, at first, that it was a plane coming in, but the light remained in the same position while I watched it and did not blink.  I don't know how long it was there before I noticed it. The unusual thing was that smaller red lights seemed to fall from it - rather like burning cinders - that seemed to burn out about half way to the ground.  I saw several of these fall.  Then the red light just went out - instantly.  I have no idea what it was, but have never seen anything like it before. Just thought I'd let you know.;42.4306;-122.8322
