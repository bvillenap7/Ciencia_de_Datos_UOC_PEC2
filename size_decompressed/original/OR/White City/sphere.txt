Saw a bright round orange light in the sky driving home (similar to large glowing embers but in formation). Got home and got out and saw two large orange objects moving south in a line, one passed the other at high rate of speed and then a third one came a 1 min or so behind. They all seemed to dim and brighten as they disappeared from sight.;42.4306;-122.8322
