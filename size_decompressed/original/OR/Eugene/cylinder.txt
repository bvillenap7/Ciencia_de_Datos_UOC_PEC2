It moved in a circular turn across my wind shield then moved away frontwards at a very fast pace, when I first noticed the craft it was moving to slow to keep its altitude with the very short front wings it had, and the turn ratio was a floating type 180 degree turn ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.
