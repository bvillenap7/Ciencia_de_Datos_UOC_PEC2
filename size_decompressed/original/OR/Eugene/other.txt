Clearly outlined, but fading very quickly. It was further south from me, rapidly heading west. It was silent, and faded much like an iridium flare fades, only faster. I originally thought it was very close and the size of a large model remote-control aircraft (the large kind, with a real motor), but I now think it was a somewhat larger craft that was further away. My friend was with me on our apartment balcony, but the thing faded before he saw it.;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981
Late Fall, 2000:  Eugene OR Bowl / Cone Two-Part UFO Sighted in Broad Daylight;2000-09-15 14:00:00;20 seconds;Late Fall, 2000:  Eugene OR Bowl / Cone Two-Part UFO Sighted in Broad Daylight I was outside smoking a cigarette on the back patio in my apartment complex.  It was a cool autumn day, with clear blue skies and no clouds, and lots of sunshine.  There was a bit of wind, as I recall.  I looked up and saw a white puff of cloud appear, like a firework...but there was no sound.   Then, a white hemispherical shape came out of the smoke, with a white/metallic cone underneath it, pointing down, and seemingly separate.   I thought to myself, This looks like a model rocket nose-cone with a parachute, I remember making those.  However, I saw no indication that a model rocket had been launched (they leave smoke trails.)   I slowly realized that this object was actually much larger and further away.   My estimates are that the bowl shape was 100ft across, at a height of 750ft to 1000ft above ground.  I puzzled over why it was hovering in the air.   Then, to my surprize, the cone began to rotate around underneath the bowl shape, clockwise if you were looking up at it from the ground.  It acted as if it were connected to the rim and remained pointing down.  There was a hazy dark cloudy spot between the cone and the bowl shape, like a field of some kind.  The cone spun around at a rate of 3 to 4 times per second. Then, the whole unit turned on its side at right angles to the ground, and proceeded due south at an estimated acceleration of 1000km/s (100 Gs!!!).  The cone continued to rotate around the rim as if attached to the bottom of the bowl the whole time it did this.  It was on the horizon and out of sight in less than 4 seconds.  Then, mysteriously, there was a second puff of smoke where the first had been, as if something closed behind it.  This happened in broad daylight!

The birds flew off, then the operator noticed what looked like another bird but at a very high altitude.  The supervisor spotted it as well. It was a craft of some kind. It was translucent white in color surrounded by a misty teardrop shaped aura.  It looked similar to a plane with swept back wings but neither of us felt is was a plane.  It was going north to south at a very high altitude.  It was so high it was barely visible it seemed to blend into the blue sky.  A passenger jet was also traveling in the same direction at a lower altitude the normal cruising altitude for commercial jets in our area.  The white craft overtook the jet like it was standing still.  It streaked to the south and then switched direction and shot straight up and disappeared from sight in a matter of seconds.  We continued to watch the sky as the jetliner disappeared from our view.  A minute or so later, we then spotted another craft flying along the same trajectory as the first UFO.  It streaked across the sky and then shot straight up and disappeared in exactly the same manner as the first one did. The sky was clear at the time, except for some contrails overhead. The craft were very hard to detect: they were very well camouflaged. If we hadn't been looking up already we never would have seen them.  Both the supervisor and the operator had seen a UFO previously one in 1989 and the other in the 70's.  We didn't report the sighting to any civil authority.;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981

Round red, yellow and blue flashing ball seen by myself and my friend 5 miles away.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible twinkling star??  PD));2013-03-06 19:55:00;3 hours;round red, yellow and blue flashing ball seen by myself and my friend 5 miles away I heard a very very loud jet of some sort go over my house about 19:55 hrs. This doesn't happen very often at all! I walked out the door to see what I could see, noticed the plane with red flashing lights.  It was going northwest and disappeared. As I was looking at the stars, I noticed an unusually bright object in the sky. At first I thought it was a plane because you could see it moving and appreared to be coming my way. Then it stopped. Red, yellow and blue lights were flashing from it as though it was a balled up rainbow. It would fade in and out of view. I ran to get binoculars and focusing in on it discovered there were two objects side by side. There was no moon shining at that time. I kept watching it by naked eye, then binoculars for approx. 5 minutes. I could barely make out the outline of a large fir tree so kept that in focus, as trees do not move. These objects kept moving.First  up and down then back and forth. They would also move away from ea! ch other, but always came back close again, Always colorful and flashing. They were very close together, but focusing on another star and keeping the binoculars very still, you could see them distance themselves then come back again closer to each other. At first they were to the left of the little dipper and the tree I had in focus. Then they gradually moved to the right of the little dipper and of the tree. I watched for over an hour till I called the local TV station. They recommended I videotape what I saw. My camcorder is broken so was not able to. They told me they would check it out. In the meantime, I got on FaceBook and found a friend that lives 5 miles from me. I explained what I seen, told her what area to look in and she seen the same things. I watched these objects for over 2 hours slowly going back and forth across the sky.All the while the lights kept flashing. Every couple of minutes they would fade away a tad, but then would be bright again. This was a very! clear sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible twinkling star??  PD));44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981
Bright orange light, flying low, moving slowly & was silent;2013-10-24 20:15:00;5 minutes;Bright orange light, flying low, moving slowly & was silent Pitch-black, clear skies, out in the country.  We saw a large bright orangish light, what looked like sitting on top of a large hill/mountain.  As we drove down the road closer to it, it remained still in the same spot.  When we got to the base of hill area, we stopped the car, rolled down all the windows & tried to figure out what it was.  It then slowly started moving across the sky.  Low enough that we could definitely see that it had a airplane shape with wing, and the bright orange light.  It made absolutely no sound at all, was completely silent.  It was low enough that we would have absolutely been able to hear it, if it was any type of normal aircraft.  No sound.  Moved pretty slowly over us and out of sight.;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981

As we got dressed to go check it out, I witnessed the light dim, re-emerge, and vanish.   Its movement was unlike any vehicle I have seen.;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981
My wife and I saw what appeared to be a commercial jetliner hovering over a field in Eugene, Oregon.;2017-07-17 19:00:00;20 seconds;My wife and I saw what appeared to be a commercial jetliner hovering over a field in Eugene, Oregon. On July 17, 2017, at approximately 7:00 PM Pacific Time, my wife and I were driving South on Lorane Hwy in Eugene, OR.  As we passed the Andrew Reasoner Wildlife Preserve, we observed to the North what appeared to be a commercial jetliner hovering over the hill, approximately one quarter mile from our position on the road, and maybe 500 feet off the ground.  My wife noticed it first and exclaimed, “Look at that.  That’s not moving at all.”  My wife was convinced it was tethered to the ground, like a dirigible.   As the driver, I was initially focused on the road, but was able to turn my head left and see the plane for about 15 seconds and it did not appear to be moving.  I tried to convince myself that it was, just flying very slowly, but I saw nothing to indicate it was changing position.   The plane was extremely low from our vantage point, we could almost see the tops of the wing surface and we could easily see the color scheme on the side of the plane (a flash of orange writing on a white fuselage).  Considering the Eugene airport is miles away to the North, and the plane was traveling, or hanging, East to West, I find no rational explanation as to why a giant commercial jetliner would be frozen, or possibly moving at a speed slower than our car.   Although I’m relaying this as if we cognized everything immediately, it wasn’t until we rounded the next corner and the “plane” left our sight that we realized how incredibly odd what we had just witnessed was.   We immediately turned the car around and were back where we first saw the plane in less than 30 seconds.  It was gone and although we had a clear view all the way to the horizon--West, North and South--we could find no trace of the “plane” in our view.   We couldn’t see clearly to the East, but it would have been impossible for the plane to head in that direction from the position it was in when it left our view and no chance we wouldn’t have seen it if it was even possible for it to instantaneously turn around.   Considering the proximity of the “plane” to our car, we should have heard the sounds of the plane's engines, but there was only the noise of our tires on the road.  The plane made no sound and didn’t show any exhaust gases.   We both are well- familiar with the area and have never seen a commercial airliner flying so low, let alone at walking speed, if not completely frozen.  It was one of the oddest things either one of us has ever experienced.;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981
