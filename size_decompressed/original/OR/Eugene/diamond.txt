3 strange objects on New Years Eve.;2016-12-31 11:10:00;10 minutes;3 strange objects on New Years Eve While outside on New Years eve in Eugene, Oregon, I noticed a reddish light moving slowly in a perfectly straight line at low altitude.  It appeared to be fairly close, but there was no sound whatsoever (as would be from a drone).  When I got my video camera and zoomed in on it, it was diamond shaped in appearance, and changed color from white to red.  It also seemed to have a strange phase in and out quality.  After a short time the light simply vanished.  In all we saw three, one immediately following the other, in the same exact straight line.  There was no elevation variance whatsoever that you would expect from some sort of balloon, and no drift pattern.;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981
