Bright Light/Metor.;1998-09-22 21:06:00;2 seconds;Bright Light/Metor I was at the Eugene Airport and was facing north at about 21:06 in the evening, when I saw a very bright white object in the sky.  At first I thought it was an airplane landing light, but it was far too bright.  The object was about a quarter the size of the full moon.  It appeared at about 45 degrees above the horizon and disappeared at about 10 degrees above the horizon.   When I first saw it it looked like the tail was coming from the front end of it, and then it formed into a ball, then it formed a tail out of the back end like a normal metor.  This all took place in just a few seconds.  The object was a very very bright white.  It looked like it was going toward the Northwest, it looked like it was about 10 degrees West of due North.  I heard a caller on Art Bell's show describe the object as green, but he also said that was through his visor, I am assuming this was the same object I saw.  The object appeared to me as if it punched throught the atmosphere or something, that's why I saw the tail at the front first then turn to a ball then form a tail out the back.;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981
Extraordinary set of 2 long lasting flashes light up the entire sky.;2003-12-14 03:38:00;2 min;Extraordinary set of 2 long lasting flashes light up the entire sky. While watching a movie early in the AM, I was distracted by two separate extraordinary flashes of light in the sky.  The Color of the flashes as viewed from inside my house was a blue/green to purple.  Each flash lasted for about 2 seconds.  (one one-thousand, two one-thousand)  This was a cold, lightly clouded evening.  The color, duration, and circumstances were not like lightening, and typicaly fireballs and meteors don't seem to come in pairs.  Each flash was about 1 minute apart.  About 5 minutes after the flashes, my roomate came home from work and described seeing the same thing as he was driving home.  The intensity, duration and color of the flashes were suprising to my roomate as well.  The flash lit up the entire sky in our area.;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981
Unidentified government craft over Eugene?;2005-02-22 21:30:00;3 minutes;Unidentified government craft over Eugene? I was driving home at about 9:30 PM on 22 February 2005, and I was only a minute or two away from being home. I saw in the medium distance, maybe a mile away at most, what looked like two streetlights in the northeast, only higher up in the air. Two amber-ish/off white colored lights. They didn't seem to be moving very fast, and I was trying to keep my eye on them off and on while I was driving. I didn't think much of it, because they could be helicopters or some kind of normal aircraft, so I was just mildly curious. I drove into my driveway and got out of the car and waited to see if I could see the lights again. At this point they were obscured by some taller trees in our neighborhood. Eventually one came over our neighborhood- not directly overhead but nearly- and I got a pretty decent look at it. Let me say first that there was not anything other-worldly about this, it followed the rules and physics a normal kind of aircraft would, but at the same time it didn't match up with anything I've seen or heard before. It flew at the approximate altitude and speed I would expect a helicopter to fly at, not very fast, but not unusually slow either. In any case, it was not at the altitude of a commercial airliner. The prominent, constant bright light on the craft obscured my vision of the actual shape/texture of the craft, being that it was night. If it had wings, there were no lights on them. On what I interpreted to be the side of the craft, there were small lights with a repeating pattern, very similar to what I've seen before on registered aircraft. I believe one was red, the others might have been white or blue. I don't remember how many of these smaller lights there were. No more than three. I believe the pattern was two-step in that one pattern flashed followed by a slightly different pattern, and then the entire sequence repeated. The entire sequence didn't take longer than two seconds to complete. Again, it was much like the patterns I've seen before.  Now, the only thing that did not cause me to dismiss this as a helicopter was the sound. There was no loud, rotary sound. It sounded very much like the sound of a distant commercial airliner, the kind of low-frequency-air-jet kind of sound, only very subdued. It wasn't nearly as loud as I would expect for an aircraft flying at the altitude of this craft. Hearing this kind of sound with a low-flying, slow-flying craft did not make any sense in my mind. Again, the sound itself was not particularly unusual, but in the context of what I was seeing, it seemed very unusual. The craft progressed toward the southwest, toward our downtown. And the second craft followed in a similar direction about 20-30 seconds later. As far as I could tell, the craft were identical, and they flew at the same altitude and speed. The entire sighting from the time I first saw the two lights in the medium distance to the time they were out of my sight was probably no more than four minutes. Possibly a little less.  To follow-up the sighting I called one of our local TV stations about an hour later, and they had received no calls about odd aircraft. The next day, Wednesday, I called the air traffic controller tower at the Eugene Airport, and the representative there said she was not aware of any government or military aircraft flying over Eugene the night before. My best guess is that these were military craft, but they resembled nothing I have seen in the past.;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981
UFO flashing color changing lights over Eugene OR;2005-06-28 22:15:00;15-20 min;UFO flashing color changing lights over Eugene OR The object would hover in one spot for a few seconds, and move in cirlces unlike any known aircraft, the whole time flashing combinations of light patterns ranging from blue green red yellow, it even made a triangle of very bright white lights, the lights would change color rapidly, and sometimes the reds would get dim, and then suddenly shift to a very bright green, it was spectacular. It fell out of sight into the horizon a couple times, and I saw the light turn yellow as it streaked away faster than any aircraft could move. This object would appear one one side of the horizon to another very fast, the most amazing thing was the lights, this object was TRYING to put on a light show for us, towards the beggining I did see two airplanes flying near it, not sure if they were just flying by or trying to observe it. This object was definately not fireworks helicopter, or anything explainable by my current knowledge.;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981

First time in a while. Walking in dark area of west eugene this night. Sun had set but horizon to east still some green and blue. I noticed a very bright high altitude object that looked to be a satallite at first, however, much brighter than I have seen satillites before and moving slower. I still thought nothing of it but watched it for the beauty of it. It then slowed in the sky and made a turn to the northeast. This caused me to give more attention. After about 10 secs more I noticed another smaller object following it at some distance. The smaller object tunrned to follow the same trajectory as the very bright object. Ive seen many satillites in my life and even saw the emrgency space shuttle re-entry landing that took place in California years ago. all I can say is that this was somewhat unusual due to size and 2 ufos with direction change. I have never reported any sighting before. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous  provides little contact information.  PD));44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981

Bright white moving in circles, left then right, forward then back.;2011-11-30 19:00:00;10 minutes;bright white moving in circles, left then right, forward then back. My friend and I were leaving work, when I looked in the sky I saw what looked like a crescent moon, but tiny and far up in the sky.  As I looked again I couldn't tell the shape, it was bright white.   It moved slowly forward, then appeared to move backwards.  Then it looked like it was going in tiny circle, then moving left and jerking back right.  We saw occasionally a bright red light attached to it.   My friend thought it was an airplane, but as I told her, planes to not move forward and back, in circles and then left and then right.  We then saw a plane fly over and she realized that indeed what we were looking at was NO plane.  I thought maybe a Satellite? but they don't move that way either as far as I know.;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981

Hovering lights, like an airplane, wavering back and forth across the night sky - very slowly moving west to north at tree line level;2012-09-10 22:00:00;ongoing;hovering lights, like an airplane, wavering back and forth across the night sky - very slowly moving west to north at tree line level I have been watching, on and off, for about an hour now, what looks like like the white and red flickering lights of an airplane, but which has been hovering at the tree line level in the northwestern sky all this time.  It's not a star or satellite, apparently, because every few minutes it seems to randomly move about, sideways, back, up and down, in an erratic manner.  But essentially it is staying in the same location in the sky.  About a half hour before I noticed this, one of my dogs seemed highly agitated (unusual for her).  She's settled down now. I do live near an airport, but this object has been in the air for a long time now -- essentially hovering in place.... I just went back outside to check, and initially couldn't see the lights, then realized that it had traveled further north, and was now below the tree line from where we are.

Moving light slowed, then stopped, then slowly faded to darkness.;2014-11-16 17:40:00;1 minutes;Moving light slowed, then stopped, then slowly faded to darkness. I was in my driveway, facing East, over my neighbors house.  As I got out of my car, I noticed a light moving relatively slowly, moving west or west southwest.  It caught my eye because the color was more orange than typical plane lights.  The speed seemed too slow for how low it appeared.   Then I began to notice the speed was slowing.  It didn't appear to turn, it just slowed until it came to a stop.  It remained stationary for 10 seconds or so, the began to fade until it just became dark.   I got a video of it on my phone, but it's just a small light that then turns off, no real detail visible.  At least it's proof that there was something there.  The night was very clear so I don't believe there was a cloud or something.  It is the only light in my video so it was the brightest light up there at the time.  I've never seen a flying object stop like that...then go dark?  Cool!;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981
Unknown aircraft in the sky.;2018-01-03 18:00:00;2 minutes;unknown aircraft in the sky My mom and I went outside for a cigarette and she said do you want to see a low flying plane, so I looked and what I saw didn't look like an airplane.  It was hovering in the sky and it looked like it was coming towards our apartment complex.  I walked to the right, and when I looked back up to the sky, it was gone.   I decided to walk back to the point in the sky that I saw the aircraft at and it was gone.  If that was an airplane, where did it go?   A minute later there was a meteorite that flashed across the sky.  Both of us are freaked out and want to know where it went.  There was a bright red light in front of the aircraft and the wing span was enormous.  It looked like it was hovering in the sky.
