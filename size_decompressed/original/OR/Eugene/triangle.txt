Large Black colored triangle shaped ship. Eugene, OR 1984;1984-03-01 22:00:00;10 minutes;Large Black colored triangle shaped ship. Eugene, OR 1984 A large trianglar craft was hovering silently about 30 in the air, along side the road. About 50 feet from the road. The craft was about 40 feet across. It had flat sides that were about 4 feet thick.. and looked to be made of metal, a dark none-metalic looking in color, with a lot of tubes and stuff all over it. There were three bright white lights, one on each corner, with a bright silver metalic colored ring around each light that was spinning. The rings had slits in them. There was a small red light in the middle that floated down to the ground and back up. There was a strong blowing wind or breeze.. but no sound at all. Other people were pulling off the side of the road to watch it. We left as soon as we discovered that it wasn't anything we'd ever seen before. I was only 17 years old, and my boyfriend at the time was 20, it scared as to death. The next day it was on the local radio. ((NUFORC Note:  Date in March 1984 is approximate.

Diamond broach shape over Eugene, OR.;1996-06-01 20:00:00;2 minutes;Diamond broach shape over Eugene, OR. I was returning from taking my kids to ballet class.  It must have been winter, because it seems to me it was dark early.  As I pulled into my driveway in the north of town, I saw a huge diamond broach shape in the sky, south-southwest.  It was humungous.  If I had put my hand up, my palm would have just covered it.  It was a triangle, point up, with lights in rows inside the triangle, like diamonds.  I don't recall how many.  It could have been 6 (1 at the point, 2 in the next row, then 3 on the bottom row), or there was another row, making 10.  It wasn't moving and didn't make a sound.  I could see lights from helicopters and small planes heading towards it from every direction.  I jumped out of the car to see it better, but my kids freaked.  They ran to the house, begging me to open the door and come in.  They didn't want it to come get us.  My kids were very young at the time, the oldest about 7, the youngest at the time 4.  I don't know why they thought this thing would take us away, and I wasn't showing fear, but rather fascination, so I'm not sure whey they reacted with such terror.  For them I went inside.  Later that night, or possibly the next night, I chatted with someone on Prodigy (remember that!?) who claimed to work out at the airport in Eugene (the airport was north of the object, behind me while I was watching the triangle).  She said there was some sort of sighting, a report made even, and no official announcement of what it was, but supposedly it was noticed by the airport, or perhaps reported by them.  Again, I can't be sure of the date, but it must have been Fall or winter of 1996, or perhaps late winter of 1997, although I don't remember it being cold, just dark early. It could even have been the year before. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981

MY HUSBAND & I OBSERVED ONE DELTA SHAPED OBJECT IN THE EARLY MORNING SKY.  IT HAD LIGHTS ON THE WING PART OF THE OBJECT THAT RAN THE LENGTH OF BOTH SIDES.  IT HAD A RED LIGHT THAT ROTATED UP & DOWN SO THAT YOU COULD SEE IT ON THE TOP AND THE BOTTOM OF THE OBJECT.  THERE WAS A BRIGHT REDDISH ORANGE LIGHT IN THE BACK OF THE OBJECT THAT STAYED STEADY.  THE ONLY FLASHING LIGHT WAS THE RED ONE ON THE TIP OF THE OBJECT.  THE LIGHTS ON THE WINGS LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE RINGED IN A DIMMER LIGHT AROUND EACH ONE.  THE OBJECT WAS APPROX. 300 TO 400 FEET OFF THE GROUND.  THERE WAS A SOUND JUST BEFORE MY HUSBAND AND I SAW THE OBJECT IT WAS LIKE A JET KICKING IN ITS AFTERBURNERS.  THE SOUND LASTED FOR APPROX. 1/2 MINUTE.  YOU COULD SEE AN OUTLINE OF THE OBJECT AS IT TRAVELED TOWARD THE CITY.;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981

Triangular boomerang shape, dark gray/shadowy color, low altitude, silent,;2002-10-07 21:03:00;7-10 seconds;Triangular boomerang shape, dark gray/shadowy color, low altitude, silent, I was standing on the back porch as I often do, facing north, waiting for the dog to finish his business for the evening. It was just after 9pm. As I stood there, I looked up into the night sky as I often do, admiring the stars. It was a clear sky, and off to the far north-northeast, something caught my eye. It looked like a distant shooting star, but that soon became unlikely to me, as it was moving horizontally in what seemed then to be from north to south, and it did not burn up and disappear as would be expected. About two to three seconds elapsed, and I found my eyes focusing in on a silent, shadowy, blur approaching my location overhead. It was in the shape of what resembled a boomerang, about the size of a hang glider, or even slightly smaller. I was surprised to realize that it was actually at a very low altitude. I felt myself grasping to identify it, and trying hard to decide that it was simply a flock of travelling birds. I believe that what I was trying to call birds were actually 5 or 7 small, dull white lights, and as the object came nearly directly overhead, I could easily see that these lights were on the V-shaped outer edge of a dark gray colored craft. In fact, the craft appeared to be made of a similar material to a B-1 stealth bomber, although it definitely was not a B-1. It was traveling north-northeast to south-southwest, at perhaps 75 feet above the treetops. The craft was moving too quickly for a flock of birds, and yet considerably slower than what would ordinarily be the stall speed of an aircraft, perhaps 45-50 mph. Again, the object was completely silent as it passed nearly directly overhead, very stable and steady in course, at an altitude which I later realized would have been below normal radar detection. My experience was of an object that was only perhaps 8 feet across at best, and this was most puzzling of all. I would not say it was large enough to carry people. I live in a suburban area, and watched it disappear over the neighbors' treetops soon after passing over my! head. T he lights may have changed color, but I am not certain of this. Curiously, I've only had one other UFO sighting in my life, when I was an older child laying in the yard looking up at the stars, maybe fifteen or twenty years ago. That object was almost exactly the same as the one I saw recently, and I finally feel vindicated that the sighting I had then was indeed not a flock of birds.;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981

Witnessed triangle shaped object w/ lights at altitude 25deg and azimuth 320 hover, then move rapidly L-R, hover again, Yaw right;2004-08-15 01:35:00;35min;Witnessed triangle shaped object w/ lights at altitude 25deg and azimuth 320 hover, then move rapidly L-R, hover again, Yaw right Object alt: 25-30deg Object Az: 320deg Mag: 0 to -1     I'm an amateur astronomer and nearly lifelong aviation buff and at approximately 1:35am Sunday, 15th Aug 2004, I had stepped out front of my house to check the cloud cover, seeing conditions and possibly some meteors. I also like attempting to track satellites and orbiting booster rockets using my scopes' electronic drive. The atmospheric conditions had steadily been getting worse all night and because my scope is somewhat labor intensive to set up, I decided not to bring it out after glancing Northwest and noticing a star flickering more than usual, typically a sure sign of turbulence in the air and generally poor seeing, also the scattered cloud cover was quickly changing to broken while moving from WSW to ENE. At that point, I noticed the star had some distinct red flashes mixed with some green and was quickly looking like one of the many commercial jets that overfly the area heading either N-S or S-N. I then began looking at the object closer and could clearly see multiple red lights and one green light and also that it looked to be at fairly high altitude but curiously, the object appeared to be motionless and looked to be between magnitude 0 and -1. Intrigued, I stood still and stared at it, comparing the distance of the lights laterally(about the width of my fist held out at arms length) to a nearby tree for approximatley 5 minutes during which time the object never moved. At that point, the object began to slowly move ENE, decreasing the distance to the edge of the tree by about 30% over a period of 20-25 seconds before stopping again. My thinking at that time was that this was most likely a helicopter but possibly a U.S Marine AV-8 Harrier in hover mode. However, what happened next left me absolutley stunned. The lights began slowly moving ENE(left to right) again but VERY rapidly increased to roughly 5 times the speed that I've observed the International Space Station cross the sky and in about 2 seconds it disappeared behind the tree causing me to verbally exclaim Whoaaa..Ho Ho!! and blink several times. I then walked West out to the sidewalk and reaquired the object which had stopped again. I was extremely tempted by now to go inside and make an attempt to assemble my telescope, drag it out and get a good look at it but was worried that by the time I got it up and running the lights would have moved off or more likely be covered by the now increasing clouds but I had to get SOME sort of closer view besides the naked eye and after watching the lights in the new position for about 2min I decided to compromise and run into the house and grab binoculars, leaving my slippers where I had last been standing to aid in reaquirment. What I saw thru the binoculars was very clear even while holding them freehand. There were 3 very red lights in an arrowhead triangle V pattern, the point appeared to be facing ESE, directly between the 2 red lights on the short side of the triangle was a distinctly greenish-white light and in the center of the object was an orange light that was flashing on and off irratically. I then began walking North on the sidewalk about 25ft to two cars parked parallel in front of my house stepping between them and sitting on the bumper of one and resting my elbows on the trunk of the other to steady the image. I then noticed the area between the red lights was slightly but noticably darker than the surrounding sky and after about 8 min I witnessed the object yaw to my left and now point to about 170 deg. The yaw manuever took between 1-2sec. About a minute later, the orange light ceased flashing and stayed on solidly but then the red light on what I describe as the objects' right(starboard) side(my left)began flashing rapidly at a rate of about 3 times per second for 7-10 seconds then up to nearly strobe light speed for 3-4 seconds then back to solid red for about 50sec and back to flashing. This went on for about 12min then all the lights stayed on solidly until clouds began obscuring them but just as the lights were about 70% obstructed, I again noticed they appeared to be flashing again, even thru the clouds until they were completely obscured. I'm 39 and I have been seriously involved with astronomy for 7 years and am used to feilding questions about what someone saw from the public at starpartys and explaining what it was and why it appeared the way it did. I also have been heavily interested in all forms of aviation since the age of 9. I put this object thru every trial I could think of during the event, moving position to make sure it wasn't a reflection off telephone wires etc. This object was not, from my perspective, ANY kind of celestial body I know of or have ever witnessed before, including satellite de-orbits, Bolides or fireballs. This object was MOST DEFINATLEY inside the atmosphere and appeared to be solid. I would describe this event as having the highest Wow factor of my entire career looking skyward. I will most certainly be looking again! ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and we found him to be quite objective in his description of the object, and most credible.  We do not know what he saw.  PD));44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981
White lights in a triangular formation over a ridgeline drifting slowly and fading out ten seconds after I spotted them;2005-02-21 22:00:00;10 seconds;White lights in a triangular formation over a ridgeline drifting slowly and fading out ten seconds after I spotted them It was a perfectly clear night. I looked NNW, standing at a bus stop in South Eugene, and I saw three white, slightly blurry lights drifting slowly to the right directly above the ridge line. They were apparently fixed together, or perhaps flying in perfect formation.  The lights looked to have size to them, not merely points of light like the stars in the background. It looked like a triangle seen nearly edge-on. It was relativelly flat. It looked to be as wide as a thumb's width at arm's length. It drifted at the speed of a bird flying for about ten seconds, fading out slowly, until it was gone.;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981
huge triangle with 3 lights;2011-01-06 18:30:00;3-4 minutes;huge triangle with 3 lights first i saw what i saw what i thought was a star then realized it was actually moving. so i pointed it out to my daughter and told her it must be an airplane super high up. she says, but daddy their are 3 and are in a big triangle.  sure enough thats what i saw also.  the lights were so far up they looked like distant stars. they moved across the sky in this pattern. it could maybe fit in the big dipper. it was headed NW. and was not visible after just a few minutes. it held this pattern and the distance between the objects did not change. when looked at as a whole it looked like a single huge object moving.  would have been hard to see without someone pointing it out.;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981

Bright triangle shape with iridescent panel type tail.;2016-09-02 23:40:00;10 seconds;Bright triangle shape with iridescent panel type tail. I went outside before retiring for the night as I usually do to look at the stars. It was clear, no moon, no wind. Out of the corner of my eye I saw a bright object.  When I looked at it, it was something I had never seen before.  At first I thought it was a big meteor entering the atmosphere, but as I looked, it appeared to be about 500 feet up, and about 1/2 mile away, and about the size of a small business jet.  It had a brilliant white ball of light at the front, and a 3 or 4 panel-like tail sections attached to it.  The sections were distinct from each other, they were iridescent radiant colors in red, green, and blue and were roughly 6 times the length of the head.  It traveled smoothly from south to north, silent, and very steady.  It looked very similar in shape to the Teston (Kent), UK/England, sighting of Saturday, August 13, 2016.  I am an amateur astronomer, can identify most aircraft, and can tell the difference between n! atural occurring phenomena and a solid object.   It was truly something like I have never seen before.  It was awesome!;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981
Saw triangle shaped craft with some kind of cloaking.;2016-09-25 20:15:00;~15 seconds;Saw triangle shaped craft with some kind of cloaking. I am a veteran of the military and an amateur astronomer so I am pretty good at aircraft identifications and where lights should be in the sky.  Last night, 09/25/2016, at approximately 20:15 I saw what looked to be a triangle shaped craft over the city of Eugene, Oregon. I had just stepped out on my balcony for a smoke and sat down in my chair facing East overlooking most of NE Eugene and N Springfield.  Looking in the sky above and well beyond the neighbor's house at the sight line of the power lines I saw 3 orange lights equidistant apart and in a triangle.  It occurred to me that there shouldn't be bright stars in the sky in that area that time of night and time of year so I  looked closer. As I  looked closer, I saw the bottom most of the lights moving and then I thought to myself:  that makes sense it is commercial aviation.  So I looked back at the other 2 lights and saw they were moving together too and that it was one triangle shaped craft rotating on its center axis.  All the while I noticed the bright orange lights were shining through what looked like heat shimmer coming off the desert floor. Very much like a scene from the movie, Predator, the cloaking around it wavered for just a brief second and when it did I saw a large triangle shaped craft with smooth sides and a smooth metallic bottom with a smaller circular abutment in the center with a light bluish glow.  The craft stopped rotating and it looked like a harrier jet pulling up its nose on a vertical takeoff and then it disappeared.  It did leave but as it was leaving the cloaking kicked back in and it disappeared from sight. Like something out of the X files 2 helicopters showed up within 30 seconds of the object disappearing.  Eugene is a small city and helicopters are fairly rare here with just a couple of overflights a day but these stayed on station for the better part of an hour circling over the Eugene/Springfield area.;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981
3 lights in a triangular formation, disappeared after getting out of car;2019-11-16 18:30:00;2 minutes;3 lights in a triangular formation, disappeared after getting out of car There was 1 UFO, seemingly above Spencer's butte, a local hiking spot. I was driving and noticed it, it was brighter than the brightest star/planet would be at that time of day, and moving slower than a satellite. It was also not blinking like an airplane. I was driving home, and the object seemed to continue to rise from the butte and come closer to me.  As I kept driving, I could see more of it.  I slowed down and squinted, and saw that it was 3 bright white lights in a triangular shape.  I was close to home so I sped up into my driveway, got out, and it was gone.  I scanned the entire sky, nothing to be seen.;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981
