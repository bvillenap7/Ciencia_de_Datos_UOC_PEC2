Green light comes falling down.;2016-07-30 10:53:00;5 seconds;Green light comes falling down I saw a green flight coming down from the sky, it seemed to paused while entering an invisible or unknown atmosphere change.  It came down gathering speed.   It was a very bright lime green.  It had a ball with the main part and a lighter green fading into a tail.   It fell behind the trees.  I was waiting for a sound of either a crash, or people shouting, but none came.  That seemed to be the whole event.   It was very clear that it happened, but I do not know on what it is or could be.;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981
