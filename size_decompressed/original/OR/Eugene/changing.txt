I saw erratic, colored lights in the sky last night;2000-08-27 23:00:00;one hour;I saw erratic, colored lights in the sky last night I am a UFO sceptic with a Ph.D. But last night something very odd happened. I was sitting watching TV when I suddenly noticed a bright light in the sky  that oscillated back and forth. It was way up there (30,000 feet?) and very luminous like a star, but it moved noticeably left and right while the other stars stayed put. When I put my scope (8 inch) on it, it became clear that this object was something strange. It consisted of orange globes of light that formed lines between themselves and connected themselves to each other by these lights.  The lines of light  moved around erratically as the globes themselves changed colors. The object was slowly moving and changing shape over and over again as it just moved around up there in the sky.  At one point it definitely looked like a saucer, with a puslating light underneath and a series of colored lights running acorss its middle. At another point it looked like the bottom of a guitar with yellow, glowing lines running acrosss its bottom. The whole experience left me feelig extremely worried: it literally seemed out of this world to me, that is, like nothing I have ever seen before and like nothing that I currently have the resources to understand. I am very eager to know if anyone else has seen this object last night in the Oregon skies. Please leave a posting if you have. I want to know that this thing was.;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981
large yellowish orange ball hovering in sky with lights bouncing around inside, slowly moving east then north;2004-01-17 22:40:00;5-7 MINUTES;large yellowish orange ball hovering in sky with lights bouncing around inside, slowly moving east then north We we're in a residential neighborhood, leaving my parent's house on 1/17/04 @ 10:40 pm. I was opening the trunk to my car when it caught my eye.  I asked my mom what is that  she turned and looked and said I don't know.  I went and knocked on the front window of the house to get my dad & husband.  They came out and my husband immediatley said that's a UFO.  I ran in the house and got my mom's camera, we took a couple of pictures, my dad got out his binoculars and the video camera.  We took about two minutes on film.  It started out in one place for a few minutes then slowly moved to the east, then slowly to the north.  It was a yellowish amber in color and very big and bright.  Through the binoculars it bounced around inside the bright outer light and changing shapes inside, going from cigar shaped to bouncing circles ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length with the husband, who described the sighting in detail.  The sky was completely overcast, and the object appeared to be below the overcast.  The witness is attempting to determine how high the overcast was on this night.  The object was distinctly orange and yellow, he reported, and there appeared to be something projecting out beyond the colored portion of the object.  In addition, there may have been detail that was visible with binoculars inside the bright portion of the object.  We are awaiting the video, or still frames from it.

I observed what seemed to be an object with a haze of lights moving in from the west. The closer the lights came the more it became brighter and more hazey. Once the object was at it's closest point my wife mentioned that she thought it was egg shaped, and made the comment, It is strange, isn't it!. The object appeared to shift off to the NW and headed off at an even speed, not too fast but with no sound and moving a bit faster than planes I've witnessed at night. I managed to shoot about 6 digital shots seeming we were headed to a Xmas gathering and I had my digital camera. After I took the shots the object continued to the NW. Not sure what I saw. I can't really trust a digital camera in lowlight with no flash, but, I'll submit a few pics anyway. The pictures are interesting.;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981
Plum red flash gets my attention;2005-09-16 20:45:00;3m:40sec.;Plum red flash gets my attention I was just about to go back indoors when a plum,red flash caught my attention. Had my video camera w/ me so i started filming in that direction just in case something came back. I saw w/ my eyes a red,orange orb in the distance so i focused in on that. The orb changed color from white to red, orange. The orb also changed shape, the orb split in two, top of it, just before it dissapeard looked to me like it formed a disk counter clock wise.  I followed it for about 49 sec.s, then lost sight of it. Kept videoing out that way when i saw with my eyes a spiraling object. It was white and looked like a sparkerler on a wheel. Focused in on that sighting and followed it for about 50 sec. The spiralling object changed shape also, and seemed to have windows on it when i put my video player in slow motion, and it looked like a disk also. Sent copy of video to ufo center, waiting for a reply. Thank you.;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981

First one appeared to be a hang-glider, but too high never descended.  A silver-gray Stealth fighter jet shape, but fluid.  One cloud looked like a huge flock of birds, a spotty wall.  It slightly brightened a large area of cloud before going out of sight behind the clouds.  Then something circular and black, but cloudy, then streamed away rapidly, leaving a black jet stream, not linear.  Two, small, black smoke-like clouds streamed down, then ascended back into the clouds.  All of this was difficult to visualize with the heavy clouds.  I have NEVER witnessed anything like this and I grew up in the midwest.;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981
Giant snowflake with pulsing lights seen over Eugene, Oregon.;2014-08-30 22:00:00;1 minute;Giant snowflake with pulsing lights seen over Eugene, Oregon. On Sat. Aug. 30th, 2014, at about 10 p.m. I saw strange lights over the sky of Veneta, Oregon, and Eugene, Oregon.  What I saw looked like a giant snowflake (for lack of better way of describing it) and it had pulsing lights all over the front of it!  The pulsing lights were in vertical sections, with one section coming on really bright and then fading, while the section next to it came on very bright.  The sections alternated like that all across the front of it. This thing was traveling through the sky at a slow speed and I think it was near the Eugene airport.   After I watch it for about 30 seconds, it suddenly divided and became two rounds things of pulsing lights.  They kept traveling through the sky at a slow speed, keeping a uniform distance between them.  After about another 30 seconds, they went behind some trees and I lost sight of them.   Two vehicles were pulled off the road in strange places and no doubt the drivers had seen this also.   I did not have a camera with me and that taught me to always have one with me in the future, as I never know what I may see! ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and she seemed to us to be quite sincere and sober-minded.  We suspect that she is a quite reliable witness.
