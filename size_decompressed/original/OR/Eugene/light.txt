three vertical red lights in the sky;1990-05-24 23:00:00;3minutes;three vertical red lights in the sky I was sitting down on a chair breastfeedingmy 10 month old baby, I saw three red lights on the sky above the tree line. I had lived in that house for 10 years and there were never any lights such as these there.  They were the size of car lights, but in the sky.and in vertical row.  I got up to see better and they dissapeared.  I sat agiain, then they appeareed again. I felt that they were watching me, so I close the curtains.  Next day, my friend told me that someone in the area had seen the red light also. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elect to remain totally anonymous.  PD));44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981
Father and son saw a light at high altitude perform zig-zags, abrupt starts and stops, and 90 degree turns.;1996-12-18 04:30:00;1 hour;SUMMARY:  Father and son saw a light at high altitude perform zig-zags, abrupt starts and stops, and 90 degree turns. I am 18. I was going to bed at 0430 when I looked out the window at the sky. I saw what I tought to be a satellite or the space shutle slowly and steadily track across the sky from the south-east twards the north-west. I watched this object for a minute and than it stoped. I thought it was strage, but I sthat it might be a satellite that had moved itself into a geosynchronous orbit or possibly the space shutle that had done the same. Than it started to move strangely. It started to do little zig-zag patterns and move very slowly and rock back and forth. It also did a couple of 90 degree turns. I watched it for about 10 minutes, than I went and woke up my dad. He came and we watched it zig-zag and turn and start and stop and do spirals. The spirals seemed strange, to me, because it would start out with a big, slow circle and than the circle would began to tighten and it would speed up untill it had come to rest where it started. I think I can best desc!ribe the spirals as looking like a planet falling into the sun. All this time the sum of its movemets were bringing it twards the west (twards us). My window faces East. At one point I thought I saw a small light seperate from it and head South-West. It was so faint that I wouldent have thought anything of it except that my dad asked me if I saw it. My dad went back to bed about 0515 and by 0530 it was out of sight over my roof. I thought about going outside to watch it some more, but I thought it was too cold and I had watched it for an hour anyway, though I hope I didn't miss any big exit.);44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981
White fuzzy circle, red streak, fireball, acceleting at a very fast rate, gone...;1999-09-01 21:30:00;5 seconds;White fuzzy circle, red streak, fireball, acceleting at a very fast rate, gone... I work at a ware-house in West Eugene, OR. At approximately 9:45, I overheard two employees talking about, the strangest thing I have ever seen. They related the story to me. Looking due west, towards the eugene airport, they saw a white light travelling in the sky, at the pace of a usual airliner, traveling from northwest to southeast. While it was the same speed of usuall aircraft,it just looked like a fuzzy light object. It continued to travel south, then developed a red streak behind it (did not mention if it was fire or anything) traveled for a few seconds, then burst into a large fireball. (I asked him if he was exagerating, and he said no, A real fireball.) THen the white object took off at an incredible rate, Southeast, then dissapeared. We talked about it around 9:45 to 9:50. This is my first time reporting anything like UFO's or stuff, but my buddies saw it, was amazed, and was confirmed by another forklift loader on a seperate end of the building.;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981
Observed an approaching light traveling from the east.  The light was below the clouds, and contiunued to approach until at a 75 degree;2000-04-12 20:58:00;3:00-3:30;Observed an approaching light traveling from the east.  The light was below the clouds, and contiunued to approach until at a 75 degree angle off the horizon.  Made no sound, looked like a small flame in the sky. Movements appeared slow, then it stopped for a short time.  It then changed direction, and traveled back to the northeast.  A ball of light followed by short streamers was then emitted from the bottom of the light.  It then proceeded to disapear. The sighting occured in eastern Eugene, almost above the city of Springfield.  I was returning home from eating dinner at a restraunt with a date when we observed a light about 30 degrees above the horizon.  It was initially at too far a distance to see clearly, but as it approached I realized it didn't have the usual aircraft lighting.  I proceeded to pull the car into a parking lot and stopped to look at the light, now almost above us, at a 75 degree off the horizon. The light's intensity seemed to flux as it faded in and out.  Note: This effect was clearly NOT due to haze difracting the light.  The light made no sound at all.  The sky was cloudy that night, and the craft was definately below these clouds.  The moon was behind us, allowing the craft to shine clearly against the cloudy sky.  The light is best described as a small flame, similar to a lit candle.  No clear shape was observed.  I was in the parking lot for about 30-45 seconds.  Another car had pulled in and seemed to observing the same light.  It then began to travel in the Northeast direction and I got back into the car and attempted to get a different view of the light.  My passenger kept an eye on the light when she could for the breif drive to a stop light in which we again had a clear view of the light.  There were at least 3 students in the street yelling and pointing at the same light.  Suddenly, the light emmitted a glowing fireball that shot down towards earth.  The glowing ball emitted had short red fire like streamers.  However, the ball emitted seemed to disapear before it came in contact with the ground.  Trees and structures blocked my view of the ground in relation to the now seemingly distant object.  Everyone starting yelling as others witnessed the event.  I immediatly tried to drive a short distance into a parking lot very close nearby.  As we were driving, the light seemed to disapear.  I had not been drinking at dinner that night, and others were present that witnessed the same strange light. I am a student at the University of Oregon.  I consider myself a scientist, with a fairly good knowledge of physics, astronomy and general science.  I grew up here and know the area well.  This craft was definately not any type of convential aircraft and defies any reasonable explanation that I can give it. I would like to know if radar reports from the airport can be obtained.  Are these public records?  Any direction you can point me in as to which steps I should take next?  I contacted a newstation but I don't think they took my reports seriously, and dismissed it as a helicpoter in the clouds.  It was NOT a helicopter, unless the military has perfect sound-dampening technology.  Again, it defies any explanation I can give it. Did anyone else report anything that night?;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981
Lights over the Oregon Coastal Mountains.;2000-10-13 20:00:00;3-5 min.;Lights over the Oregon Coastal Mountains. It was just after 8pm on Friday night, the 13th of October, 2000.  I was out in the Elsea Unit of Oregon settling in for dinner in my vehicle after a day of hunting.  The area I was in is west of Eugene.  I parked at the very top of one of the highest mountains in the area, right at the edge of a clear-cut. I could see for miles over the tops of many surrounding mountains.  The sunset was at 6:33pm that night.  There was a bank of clouds flowing filling the valleys and another wave of clouds floating over the mountain tops.  I looked up at the horizon and saw some small lights in the distance.  I figure that they are maybe 5 miles away.  The lights are white for the most part and changed in intensity. The color would sometimes be yellow or red.  The group consisted of four lights that would dance or play around in a relatively tight grouping.  About the area of a dime at arms length. My first thought was that they were other hunters traversing the mountains. From my vantage point however, I could see they were above the other mountains and moving much too fast for a car or truck viewed from this distance.  A couple times one of the lights would dip down into a valley, but never low enough to go out of sight.  The light dipping into the valley meant that it couldn't be lights of a distant town flickering through the clouds.  After a couple minutes, I noticed another group to the right of the first. It was more of a line of 5-6 light closer together.  The way they flickered made me believe that they were flames of a large fire.  That was until one from the first group moved over to join the line. A few seconds later, it or another one returned to the first group.  Roughly five minutes had elapsed before I realized I had the digital camcorder.  I climbed outside to get a better shot.  It took several tries to get anything to show up on tape due to the distance in the dark. I switched it to infrared.  Nothing. I turned up the gain. It worked.  The lights and tree tops were present although fairly grainy.  I managed to get one minute recorded to tape before the clouds became too thick. In the morning, I cammed the same direction for sake of comparison and took nine gps readings to comfirm exactly where I was standing.;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981
What appeared to be a falling star , changed it's mind and made a hairpin u-turn and shot back up the way it came.;2000-11-08 22:30:00;8sec.;What appeared to be a falling star , changed it's mind and made a hairpin u-turn and shot back up the way it came. Standing along the side of my house away from lights where I usually look at the stars , I was egerly awaiting the usual shooting star before turning in for the night . I didn't have to wait long and what I saw was not the ordinary track of a falling star . It began burning as normal falling at the right speed , angle about 45 degrees above the Eastern horizon . It appeared to come towards my location at the usual altitude but as the last w of wow left my lips - it had made a u-turn and shot back up at the same rate of speed and kept it's brightness till it vanished . If you were to open one end of a paper clip 45 degrees away from itself , that would pretty much match the escape trajectory . I chuckeled to myself and said aloud woops wrong address  . If it had bounched off somthing in the atmosephere it should have broken up . Next time I'll bring my video camera ! ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  PD));44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981

A zipzag light in the night sky hovering and flying with supersonic speeds.;2003-02-01 02:00:00;20 seconds;A zipzag light in the night sky hovering and flying with supersonic speeds. This is an old report, but I have thought about it for a long time and I decided to share what I saw. In Eugene, Oregon in 2003, somewhere between January and March (I can’t recall now), I woke up in the middle of the night to feed my baby. After I put him back to sleep, I left his bedroom and walked down the hallway to my room. We had large sky lights on the ceiling. I looked up and at that moment, I saw what I thought was a falling star it the night sky. It looked exactly like a falling star as I watched it trend downward across the sky. It was a white light like a star, small and far away. Then as it flew downward it stopped. It seemed to hover. That caught my attention. Then it shot upward the opposite direction at lightning speed. A speed ten time faster than it had been going before.;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981
Video on infrared records something;2005-09-05 13:30:00;1m. 10sec.;Video on infrared records something I had my Sony ccd trv 318 video cam recording on a tripod pointing west.  Was using a M&K 1000 infrared filter w/ nightshot in the afternoon, clear sunny day.  I was talking with my friend and just letting the video cam record pointing up in the sky.  Like i said it was on infrared so i would have to be looking thru the view finder to see what the camera could see.  I hooked it up to my tv and saw where the camera picked up a siver spot that floated in from the west to south east.  You can see a black distortion, front and back of the object, on a larger tv is better. I'm sending copy of video to UFO Center.  Thank you I don't remember seeing any aircraft in the from the west like that.  Thank you ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  We are awaiting the tape.

Blinking, bright white light seen travelling at high altitude;2008-03-02 20:30:00;2 mins;Blinking, bright white light seen travelling at high altitude We stepped outside into the backyard in West Eugene and saw a bright white light that was steadily blinking. It was odd... aircraft generally have one solid white light with a red and green on each side. There was no noise... just a white light that blinked steadily. It moved steadily across the sky, directly overhead, and moved behind some high, very thin clouds. At this point, it disappeared.  I stepped out into the front yard to scan the sky in the direction it was travelling.  It never reappeared! It travelled about the speed of a low-altitude plane, but was as high in the sky as a jetliner.   The light was brighter than a jet would be. Strange!   I have been a field investigator for 18 years. I've spent much of this time investigating Bigfoot reports for Oregonbigfoot.com, of which I am the director.  However, I've spent many years following up on UFO reports as well. I'm very aware of the appearance of planes and jets at all altitudes.  This did NOT have the appearance of those. I would add that there have been two occasions in the last few months that my research partner and I have been up near Oakridge, Oregon and have seen steady, bright white, soundless craft moving across the sky.  I captured these on film on one occasion.;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981
Orange light ascending at a 75 degree angle on a straight trajectory.;2008-07-04 21:45:00;15 seconds;Orange light ascending at a 75 degree angle on a straight trajectory. @ approximately 9:45 P.M (twilight) on July 4 I was standing in front of my house (facing north) watching the neighborhood firework displays in the distance when I noticed a orange light ascending at a 75 degree angle from the WNW to the NW. At first I thought it was an ember from the mortar shells but its trajectory was as straight as an arrow and was unaffected by the winds aloft. It continued from my first notice for at least 10 to 15 seconds into the high atmosphere and then the light went out. I know this could be dismissed as an ember but it didn't behave like any ember I have witnessed in the past. Being the 4th it could easily be dismissed as a firework related event but after thinking about it for 2 days I thought it worthy of reporting.;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981
Something is going on in Eugene, Oregon.  Many sighting from many people across many months.;2009-07-20 22:15:00;5 Minutes;Something is going on in Eugene, Oregon.  Many sighting from many people across many months. Something is going on in Eugene Oregon. If you read the reports for Eugene/Springfield, Oregon, many people are reporting the same type of sighting.  These reports are spread across many months/years. I saw the UFO last night on a walk in west Eugene.   Was a bright light moving across the sky from west to east.  This was about 5 miles south of the Eugene airport and directly in the landing/takeoff path of aircraft from the airport.  If you look at a map of the airport you will see the main runway runs north to south, so this UFO crossed directly across the path of normal air traffic.  I haven't see an airplane ever move in an west to east pattern this close to the airport. Craft details.  I have no idea how to judge the height or speed of the UFO.  It was much too bright and moving to slow to be a satellite.  We did see satellite about 10 minutes after the UFO was gone for comparison.  The craft flew directly over head and was completely silent.  As it moved east, it finally sped up and was not visible any longer. About 30 minutes, we either saw the same UFO or one that looked exactly like it.  It was moving south to north at a rapid pace, but was far to the east of us.  An airplane with blinking light was moving in the opposite direction at the same time, but the UFO was much quicker and appeared to be at a much lower altitude. I also believe we saw this UFO on July 4th.  We were north of the Eugene Airport by 10 miles.  The light appeared to be south of the Airport and stopped hovered for about 10 minutes.  Then disappeared. I would assume this UFO is some sort of manmade device, but it is very hard to speculate on its speed and height as there is nothing to use as a reference.  It also does not follow the normal traffic pattern of aircraft that frequent the airport.;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981

lights in the night sky near Mount Piscah, Oregon;2011-06-17 23:30:00;30 seconds;lights in the night sky near Mount Piscah, Oregon On the evening of June 17th, 2011 around 23:30 as I was at an outdoor festival at Mount Pisgah, Oregon, near Eugene, I noticed what appeared to be a very large, bright, white object in the western sky.   When I first noticed it, it was stationary and I thought it might be a planet, though it appeared to me larger than I have ever known a planet to appear.  I observed this object in a stationary position for about 10 seconds.  As I watched, this object suddenly grew slightly larger with a flash of white light then immediately shrank down to the size of the surrounding stars.   As I kept my eye on it the small shape slowly begin moving upwards toward the zenith of the star field, faded away and was gone about 5 seconds after it started moving. About 10 minutes later I noticed two very large, bright white objects in the southern sky.  They appeared exactly as the first object did in brightness and size and they appeared to be about a hands width distance apart if I stretched my arm out in front of me.  They were positioned vertically to one another.   I watched them in this stationary position for about 10 seconds.  At that time they shrank down to the size of stars and then begin moving together toward the west very slowly.  They appeared to move together as one unit, keeping an equal distance apart as they moved.   They grew dimmer and disappeared about 5 seconds after they started moving.;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981

I was walking and she was riding my bike ahead of me about 50 yards when I noticed a flame-like light below the clouds approaching from the West.  On 8/30/2010 I had seen the exact same type of light above Veneta about 15 miles away.   As before I stopped to watch it approach.  Its speed was relatively slow and its altitude left it below the clouds. It then slowed gradually to a stop at which time I called for my girlfriend to come see.   By the time she reached me the flickering orange-yellow light had come to a stop where it remained as we watched for about a minute before it moved away in the opposite direction.  This was exactly the same behavior I had witnessed the year before. It was as if it had noticed me, stopped for a bit and then moved off.

They were about the size of Jupiter maybe slightly larger. I didn't automatically think UFO, I actually thought huh, a new street light?  It was hard to really stare and get a good look while driving but I tried and I realized that whatever it was, was not a street light.  I couldn't make out many details but this is what I observed: 5 or 6 bright white lights that were round, looked like stars and were about the size of jupiter maybe slightly larger.  There was one in the middle and I believe 5 that surrounded it. All the same size.  They reminded me of fireflies, they were not completely stationary but fluttering.  The ones on the outside were almost dancing around the middle one which stayed relatively still.  The other thing I noticed was that I couldn't really tell if they were close or far away.  Definitely closer than s! tars but much farther away than the trees but where exactly in-between those two was really hard to tell. Just a side note...i was skeptical to believe it was a ufo...i hear about these things all the time but to actually see one...  I drove the same streets the next night to see if there was in fact a new street light or any lights in the same spot and nothing.  Did anyone else see it?

Star looking lights with flashing red, green, and purple lights that just hover around ! NOT GOING ANYWHERE!  ((Star?));2012-10-01 20:00:00;hours;Star looking lights with flashing red,green,and purple lights that just hover around ! NOT GOING ANYWHERE! My girlfriend had been telling me ,a couple days before this ,that she had seen a UFO in the sky ,to the east of our house ,above the tree line.I did not pay too much attention to her ,until monday October 1st,2012 when i was watching tv and randomly looked out the window . I saw a light that caught my attention because it looked like an airplane but was not moving. I went outside on my deck and looked closer at this . It was a light that looked like a star ,but brighter,and seemed to have flickering red and green lights on it that told me it was a plane, but it was not moving anywhere.  I had a view of this between 2 trees and could tell it was not going anywhere,this light was west of my house above the treeline. As I am watching this light with my son ( 16 yrs .old ) ,  my girlfriend yelled at me that she can see another one on the other side of the house , to the east.We live outside Eugene, Oregon ,on a mountain, where there are no lights from the city ,m! aking the stars stand out with great brightness. We watched both of these lights for a while and only saw them move slightly up and down ,and side to side once in a while .  I got out my binoculars and could definately see flashing green and red lights and once in a while there was a dark ,almost purple blue light that was not constant, seemed to be random...... When I was watching the on to the west, I saw a bright flash of light close to the others that looked like maybe if you shined a realy bright light at something chrome or a mirror or something . This light never flashed again , that I saw . Ya know ,it was more like a flash of a camera, times 1000 !!!So that kinda weirded me out , but then last night Oct.2nd , we were at King Estates Winery for my birthday dinner,15 miles from our house and again on a mountain with no city lights, and there they were , in the same place as the night before !!!!!!!  This is realy tripping me out !!!! tonight my brother is bringing over! a camcorder to see if we can capture this on film, if they ar! e still there, wich i am sure they will be since they have been there for a week almost!  Somebody REALY NEEDS TO GET AHOLD OF ME !!!!!!!!! ((NUFORC Note:  We strongly suspect a sighting of a twinkling star.  PD));44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981
Bright star in the horizon during sundown fades away.;2012-12-11 16:30:00;5 minutes;Bright Star in the horizon during sundown fades away. Right during sun down i was watching T.V.  I noticed a light that caught my attention in the sky.  It caught my attention because there was still light out in the sky and you could still make out the clouds. The light was a very bright white.  It seemed odd because it was not high in the sky from my point of view and because it was a very clear bright light and there were no other stars visible in the sky.  I sort of figured it was just a very bright star. I was facing South in the direction of the light. In front of my home there is a 3 story building across the street.  The light was in the distance but just above the horizon of the building from my point of view. I don't believe it was close at all since it just appeared like a very bright star in the sky at sundown. The light remained stationary, I asked the person next to me to look at the light.  They first thought it was a light from a building very far away since it was a very bright white light, sort of the type you would see on Tall building Radios. I told them that it was not because we don't have those types of tall buildings in our city. They then just said at it in confusion. There were no sounds of helicopters around and there were no other lights around it, something a helicopter might have. ( red and white )  It did not move and stayed in the same position.  After a few minutes, It suddenly began to dim. and then the light was gone just before the sun completely went down.  The Dim of the light lasted about 10 seconds before it completely went out. Could of it been a drone?  Why would a drone need such a powerful light when there was still light out? and Don't most LED lights go off suddenly?  rather than a 10 second fade away?  the light did not seem near, appeared to be very far away like a star.;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981
I saw several orange lights traveling east and then turning south as I was driving west from Springfield to Eugene, OR right by I-5.;2013-02-14 12:20:00;10 minutes;I saw several orange lights traveling east and then turning south as I was driving west from Springfield to Eugene, OR right by I-5. I was driving on Centennial in Springfield going back to Eugene when i saw some orange lights in the sky coming from the direction of Autzen Stadium.   I was driving a pizza delivery truck and I pulled over on a side street to get a picture and to see if I could hear noise, but I5 was between me and the lights, so I drove over I5 and pulled over again to see 2 more go over.   I got pictures of those with my cell phone.   They are like 3 I saw on June 4, 2011, in the same area.  They turned before they crossed over I-5 and went south.;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981
Six blinking lights in formation, glide up and then down again over Eugene Or.;2013-04-01 20:40:00;20-30 minutes;Six blinking lights in formation, glide up and then down again over Eugene Or. My Grandson called me to come look at the lights at appox. 8:40 PM.  By the time I went outside, there were six flashing lights that seemed to both rise further off the horizon and closer to us.  When they started he only saw 3, but that was because they were coming up over the horizon.  They were blinking lights in a perfect order and distance apart.  They came up and hovered and slowly went back down below the horizon. While they were up, I did call a local news station to see if there had been any sightings and some other family members.  It was a cloudly night and they didnot see them.  My compass said it was 63 degrees N.E.  They were much bigger then stars. They flashed and glided slowly, never losing formation.  I had 6 teenagers who watched for 20-30 minutes. We could not get pictures. They turned out too dark.;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981

Saw the usual aerial fireworks but then saw 2 bright red lights traveling from the west and then turning in a wide arc to the south.  At first I thought they were fireworks gone awry and waited for them to explode.  Neither of them did.  That attracted my attention as being odd.  One was above the other.  After about 3 minutes first one then the other faded and disappeared several miles southward.   Went out an hour later (at 0:54) to have a smoke and saw a red light come from the west from the direction of Florence, Oregon followed by 6 others.  As they traveled in my direction, they all appeared to be moving very fast. They appeared to be traveling high above the oregon coast mountain range.  I have always watched the weather coming in from the coast ( we live 60 miles inland) and have a pretty good idea of what the weather is going to do here in the Willamette valley based on my observations of cloud activity wes! t of us.  I've seen a lot of jets in the area but none of them flies from that direction or that fast.  All of the red lights disappeared at the same point several miles toward the south.  All of them followed the exact same trajectory and faded quickly and disappeared at the same point in the sky. I have lived less than 2 miles from the Eugene airport for the past 23 years.  I have seen private airplanes, private jets, commercial jets, cargo jets, navy sub killer aircraft conducting touch and go training flights, and a wide variety of military jets taking off after re-fueling on north to south trajectories.  I know all of the trajectories for all of the aircraft that fly over or around my home and, at times, what time of day I can expect to see particular airlines.  I am can distinguish the difference between night time aircraft lights and landing lights between fixed wing and jet aircraft.  I also know the sound that all of them make.   Tonight I neither heard nor saw anything I have ever experienced.  There were none of the usual stro! bing lig hts, throbbing engine sounds, or jet sounds.  I have also seen military jets climbing at night.  Their after burners have never looked red.  What I saw and heard were bright red lights that fluctuated minimally and felt, but did not hear, a slight bass hum.    Conditions were clear, 23 degrees F, no clouds, and a bright half moon in the sky.  I have never seen any thing like this in my 55 years on the planet.;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981

Enjoying a Hot Tub in the evening noticed a distant white light traveling from south to north watched as it turned into a orange glow continually traveling at a good speed.  Than i noticed what appeared to be a parachute and object dropped down into the Valley of Eugene.  Went inside house to share sighting with Friend than came out to notice a bright orange Glow descending down from the sky seemed to be different than the first object than lost sight as it went behind some trees.

Those stars were definitely not stars.;2017-08-29 21:45:00;5 minutes;Those stars were definitely not stars. Sitting outside at about 9:45pm and we see what looks like a night sky full of stars, start moving about in little zips and pauses.    Then one seemed to drop down into our atmosphere and a bright flash went off towards our direction, almost like they knew we were watching and then the brightest one went back to what    I'm assuming was its position playing possum and was just a star again.   This is not a hoax or a joke on our part... FACT.. amazing..;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981

Symetrical line of lights moving southwest to northeast.  ((Starlink satellites??));2020-02-18 05:25:00;15;Symetrical line of lights moving southwest to northeast I was looking to the east at 5:25am.  I saw 3 stars, similar to Orion's Belt.  At first I thought 1 star appeared to be moving south to north but then it was all 3 appearing to move in the same direction.  As I watched I realized there was a line of about 30+ stars stretched from the northeast horizon to the southwest (just over and behind my head), equidistant from each other, and moving from southwest to northeast.  I realized I needed someone else to see these things and got a coworker to get out of her car and witness the last 10-12 of them as they moved out of sight to the northeast.  These appeared to be stars or satellites but they were symmetrically spaced and moving at the same speed in the same direction and they stretched across half the sky (30-40+).  I'm a Certified Nursing Assistant and the other witness is a cook in the facility where I work.  I've seen other unusual things in the sky but never more than one or two and never long e! nough  for another person to witness them.  Honestly, this was amazing!;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981

Orange Star-Shaped UFO Flying Over Amazon Park;2020-08-19 21:10:00;15-30 seconds;Orange Star-Shaped UFO Flying Over Amazon Park At around 9:10 PM while out on a walk I witnessed a silent, orange colored orb-shaped UFO fly over Amazon Park. I was out taking a walk like I usually do in the evenings in the area of south university neighborhood in Eugene a few blocks away from the University of Oregon when I just happened to look up to see what I thought was maybe an airplane or satellite flying southwestward.  What made me realize that this craft was not either an airplane or satellite was when the orange-colored, star-shaped orb stopped in mid-air, started flying southward, then stopped again, only to then start to move down towards the ground. The UFO seemed to first start heading in my direction, being eastward, but then suddenly stopped and began heading southwestward.  When it started moving towards the ground I knew for certain that this was a UFO.  The entire incident lasted about 15-30 seconds. The road I was walking down was a steep hill, which gave me somewhat of a range to see around the area which would be Amazon Park.  This orange-colored orb-shaped UFO seemed to be flying almost directly above the area of Amazon Park.  The aircraft looked like a very orange star.  If the aircraft hadn’t been moving I would most certainly have mistaken it for a star in the evening sky and kept walking. This aircraft also did not make any noise.  If this had been a helicopter or airplane I would have heard it. And man-made aircraft cannot stop mid-air and suddenly change directions.  This was something completely out of this world (maybe even literally).;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981
