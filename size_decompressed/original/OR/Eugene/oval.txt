Oval object seen racing from west to east over Eugene, Oregon.;2003-07-19 19:20:00;2 minutes;Oval object seen racing from west to east over Eugene, Oregon. I was sitting out in our backyard after dinner when I noticed what I thought was a balloon (like a child's balloon that someone had let go of) crossing the sky from west to east. I asked my wife to come out and see what I was looking at and we both watched the object together for about 2 minutes. The object was moving too fast for a plane, had no sound, and seemed rounded and had a silvery/white look to it. It was still light out and clear, the sun seemed to illuminate this object as it got further away. Eventually the object went out of sight.;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981
The Great Northwestern Christmas UFO 2010;2010-12-31 07:00:00;Many Hours;The Great Northwestern Christmas UFO 2010 On Dec 31st, 2010, i awoke same as I did every day and went outside first thing and lit up a cigarette.  Upon looking up at the sky, i saw a large oval shaped object hovering in the distance.  It was the only light in the sky other than our moon, and it was much bigger in size than a star. This ufo was first seen in the skies of the great northwest.  It has been scaring me as to not knowing what it could be, and I am again clueless as to what it is.   I have included photos and videos of it.  Careful inspection of the photos revealed a large object with a black center illuminating white light. I have been seeing this ufo in the sky countless times over a month long.  You look at the evidence and tell me what you think it could be.  Be warned, it is scary.  Also, it is only visible late at night and the early mornings.;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981

Multiple Bright orange object above Santa Clara/Eugene;2016-06-18 20:45:00;10-15 minutes;Multiple Bright orange object above Santa Clara Eugene. 6/18/2016 Time: 8:45PM PST. An orange solid very bright oval object crossed through the window just to the right of my TV view screen.  The window is located in my vaulted area of me ceiling above my front door. When I saw it I was awe struck with the size and orange brightness as it progressed to the right side of my window.  A few moments later, another Bright orange same size solid object came into view in line.  I jumped up went outside.  There they were.  Suddenly, a third was in view from the East coming in my direction.   I ran back inside and grabbed my wife out of bed.  We both saw the third and then a fourth.  They seemed to be in formation.  As they got closer they began to go towards the right or South.  As they moved silently, I noticed there was no sound.  I also looked for wind.  It was a perfect dusk night.  No wind.  No sound.  Just more lights.   I told my wife to go back inside and grab her cell.  At first she could not see anything on the cell display.  She handed me the phone and I held it up into the sky at the objects regardless and pushed the button in hope it might see something. The photo is included with this report.  Unfortunately, the image does not show a very clear shot.  The good news is there is a tree, house, low small cloud in the image for comparison. I went back in the house as the objects disappeared towards the right into the trees. A put on my pants and went back out just in case.  Who knows, perhaps they would circle around?  My neighbor was coming around the corner in his car.  He asked if I saw some -thing?  Told him hell ya.  He said he say them also and his daughter also saw them from the house.;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981
