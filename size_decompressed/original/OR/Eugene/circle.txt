Circular object that looked like star in blue sky moved slowly south, stopped, changed directions and went north.;2010-05-13 16:00:00;8-10 min;Circular object that looked like star in blue sky moved slowly south, stopped, changed directions and went north. Viewed from backyard while watching chem trails in blue sky.  Object looks like star when sunshine relects from it, and like a ring when not.  Object moved very slowly on same path as chem trail only seemed much higher.  It moved unlike any airplane going south at first, then stopping completely for several minutes, then changed directions and began moving north on the same track it seemed to come from.  It showed no trails or exhaust of its own.  Object then got further away until we could no longer see it.  We did capture digital images and video.;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981
Five fiery lights/dark circular objects seen by young couple in Eugene, OR.;2011-09-27 21:00:00;10 minutes;Five fiery lights/dark circular objects seen by young couple in Eugene, OR. It was about 8:50 p.m. on a Tuesday night, Tuesday the 27th of September 2011, when my fiancé and I saw what looked like a ball of fire coming from the north, moving across the sky.  The night was mostly overcast with slightly orange tinted clouds, the wind was gently blowing from the north, and the temperature was about 60-65 degrees.  We were on our way to the store, walking up and around a nearby hill, in a mostly residential neighborhood, when it appeared. I at first thought it was just a brightly lighted plain or helicopter, but then noticed that the light seemed fire-like, red-orange-yellow, and slightly flickering.  There was no sound coming from it.  The next thing we noticed, for both my fiancé and I were watching at this point, was that the fire/light seemed to be focusing towards the back of the craft, and then went out completely, about the time it passed over-head, though a little to the right from where we were standing.  And because the clouds were somewhat bright from the light pollution of the city, we both saw that, after the light had faded, there remained a small, dark, circular object.  At a distance it looked as small as a pupil, between an eighth and a quarter inch.  But there was no mistaking its flawless shape and its smooth edges. It was a perfect circle, black to my eyes, at least in the darkness.  Still silent, it continued on southward until we lost sight of it in the distance. Amazed, and a little frightened, we asked each other some typical questions, just to make sure we were both seeing the same thing as it was happening. “Could you see it?   Did you see its shape?  I can’t believe this!”  Then, about 30 seconds later, from the same direction, another one appeared, as silent as the first.  It looked the same fiery, moving southward, and its light also slowly receded towards the rear of the craft, and then went out, again, revealing a dark, round object beneath the clouds.   We both observed that the light went out about the same moment as the first, almost directly overhead of us, but to the right.  But unlike the first craft, which held a seemingly straight course, and remained dark, this one turned left and right in small, quick and smooth movements, and relit just a flicker in the rear, fiery like before, only faint and small.  Then, the small light that reappeared seemed to move around the edge of the craft, in either direction, but never in a ful! l circle.  (I found this particularly strange, because I assume that a round craft would most likely spin to stay in flight, but the small light that reappeared did not.)  The light then seemed to go out again as the ship went further away into the distance. Almost as soon as we lost sight of the second craft, a third appeared.  Again, it came from the north and made its way south, looking just like the first two, and making no sound.  This one acted more like the second craft though, turning slightly, this way and that, and relighting after about 5-10 seconds of darkness, during which it was revealed as another round, dark object beneath the clouds.  The light that reappeared on this craft was small like the other, and also seemed to move around the edge of the dark circle it was attached to, but not in full circles. Before the third was even out of sight, the fourth appeared, just as the others had, and acted much like the second and third.   Each one was completely silent, all moving at what looked like the same speed, and in the same direction, taking about 25 seconds to cross from one edge of the sky to the other. Then, there was no more to be seen for what felt like 2-3 minutes, and we continued on to the store, watching the sky behind us. We were heading west.  After about 2 or 3 more minutes, we reached the store and went in.  The clock in the store said that it was almost 9:00 p.m. Coming out, we looked again towards the direction of the sighting, and saw the fifth and final craft. At this point we were surrounded by a bit more tree growth, and further away, so we didn’t get a good look.  But we saw that it was plainly another light of the same color, moving in the same direction, and its light also seemed to extinguish, though we couldn’t see if it came back or not. It was the first time either of us had seen anything like this, and as soon as we got home we start searching for the right people to talk to.;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981
UFO's all over the night skies of eugene, oregon.;2012-09-01 23:00:00;2 hours;UFO's all over the night skies of eugene, oregon. Me and a friend were walking to a grocery store near coburg rd. We saw an illuminating light in the sky that was flying towards the Northwest.  We watched it fly all the way across the skyline and dissapear. After making our purchase at the store we noticed another ufo on the other side of town that was also illuminating.  Employees of the grocery store and other pedestrians also observed this flying object.  On our walk home we noticed triangulations of illuminating lights and packs of them all over the sky.   There had to be 15-20 of them at least.  There were also low flying small airplanes underneath these ufo's that looked like they were either keeping tabs on them or surveying them. Never getting too close to these objects ofcourse. This has been going on alot recently in the skies of eugene and nobody seems to want to talk about it.;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981
Strange object in northwest sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a sighting of Venus.  PD));2015-04-26 23:07:00;20 minutes;Strange object in northwest sky. At 11:07pm, I and one other person saw a bright glowing circle light yellow with a red center in the northwest sky in west Eugene.  It got brighter and then would dim repeatedly.    We checked online to see if it was a large star or perhaps a planet.   It disappeared about twenty minutes after we noticed it.;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981

I thought it was a satellite, at first, but then I noticed it was moving way too fast.  More like the speed of an airplane, but it was flying low enough I should of heard its engine if it was an airplane.  It was also flying in a zig zag pattern.   At first the color of the object looked yellow, then as it went by blue or red, I can't remember.   It could of been an airplane, but I've never seen one move like that ever, and it was quite.;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981
Colorful Object hover over house before flying south.;2015-09-19 20:50:00;8 minutes;Colorful Object hover over house before flying south. I saw a really bright colorful object hover over a house across the freeway from me.  It hovered there for about 4-5 mins until it flew south (normal speed of an airplane).  It was probably 500 - 1000 feet up.  I saw the same thing in July (I reported it on this website).  I did take a video with my ipad (so the quality is crap) that I will email.;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981
What at first appeared to be a satellite shoots straight towards me at high speed, then reverses direction back to where it had been.;2016-09-13 20:40:00;2 minutes;What at first appeared to be a satellite shoots straight towards me at high speed, then reverses direction back to where it had been. I was sitting in a lawn chair looking up in the night sky not long after dark, when I spotted what I thought was a satellite to the east of me.  I noted that it was about the same brightness as the surrounding stars except that it was moving across the sky at the speed of the usual satellite in a SW direction. When it was aligned in front of and above me, at about 95-100 degrees, it appeared to suddenly shoot straight down towards me at a high rate of speed growing larger and brighter (bright white) the closer it came, maybe to about 10x the size it had been, not any larger than a dime.  I thought to myself that if it continued in that direction it might hit me.  Then about ½ way down it suddenly reversed direction and went back up to the approximate altitude that it had been, continuing on its course in approximately the same SW direction.  The up and down trajectory lasted not more than a second or two.  A friend of mine was walking towards me, from behind, whe! n I exclaimed, Whoa! in regard to the object coming towards me.  He did not see the object until I pointed it out after the fact. So what he saw looked like a normal satellite traveling across the night sky.  We watched the object as it continued SW with no more unusual activity.  So what was the object: a military hologram, an ET spacecraft, something going on with my eyes (doubtful), or what?
