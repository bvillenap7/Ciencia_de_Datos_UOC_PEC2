Chevron shaped craft over Eugene dunno what it was;2004-08-05 22:00:00;4 seconds;Chevron shaped craft over Eugene dunno what it was Like a hangglider in shape, it was hard to detect depth as I'd been staring at satellites and looking for meteorites during the shower, but maybe a mile up.  It had 3 white lights on it.  It was so fast, it made no noise. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We spoke with the witness via telephone, and he seemed quite credible to us.  PD));44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981
Chevron with multiple rows of dim lights, moved in a perfect straight line across night sky, from south to north, for 15 seconds.;2020-08-10 01:03:00;15 seconds;Chevron with multiple rows of dim lights, moved in a perfect straight line across night sky, from south to north, for 15 seconds. At about 1:03 a.m., in the early morning hours of August 10, 2020, I saw something out of the corner of my eye coming over the distant trees to the south. It was faint but very distinctive.  The sky was completely clear and dark but this object resembled something as it might be traveling through clouds because it was very hazy and muted. Yet, I was able to make it out clearly. It was shaped like a very wide V but the point was a bit more curvilinear-kind of like a boomerang. Each side of the V was made up of about three rows of thin, parallel striations of light that crossed the V lines. Think of train tracks, or a flock of geese flying in formation. That is what it reminded me of, with the outstretched wings representing the lights. Only you would have about three rows of geese side-by-side. The color of the lights was a golden yellow to orange.  This object was about 5 times the size of an airplane that you would see way up in the sky, where sound from the plane can no longer be heard—from where I sat it appeared as about a ½” to ¾” object. There was no sound whatsoever--it was completely silent.  I saw the UFO come into view as it passed over the trees to the south of me. It moved faster than a plane that passes overhead, but it didn’t streak across the sky either. It moved at a consistent rate in a completely straight line from the south to north, and my gaze followed it until it passed over rooftops and trees in the distance.  I would say I watched it for about 10-15 seconds. I came inside and drew a picture of it, then took a photo of the drawing, altering it a bit to make it look similar to what I saw if anyone is interested in seeing it. It is the strangest thing I’ve ever seen and I can’t get it out of my mind.;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981
