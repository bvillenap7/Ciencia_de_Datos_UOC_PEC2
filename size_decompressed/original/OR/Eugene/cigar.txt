The object appeared to be a very large jet flying very low. There was no sound or trail coming from it. It would have to have been taking off from the local airport but the airport is a small one located far from where we saw the object. It had what appeared to be very small wings at midpoint on the fuselage colored red and black. The rest of the craft was silver. It was huge and noiseless. As we watched it move up towards a cloud I told my friend that it would not come out the other side of the cloud because too many people would see it at the slow rate it was moving. It did not come out of the cloud which is impossible for any aircraft we are aware of.;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981
blimp like shaped object moving across the sky at sunset. Absolutely silent. Let us have a good look, but got  no pic.  ((Contrail??);2004-06-04 20:40:00;2-3 minutes;blimp like shaped object moving across the sky at sunset. Absolutely silent. Let us have a good look, but got  no pic. I am ((age deleted)) and my daughter is ((deleted--20's)), her husband is ((20's)). I am an MA in ((language)), and a BA in ((art field)), and in ((languages)). My daughter is ((executive))r for the ((store name deleted)) here in Eugene. Her husband is a ((finance)). I am currently babysitting my grandchild fulltime.     My daughter and I were on their deck at about 8:30 or a little after because I was telling her about the curious jet/chem trails I had seen earlier in the day. We noticed a jet in the distance going straight up, and I mentioned how odd that seemed to me... I see them every so often and wonder where they came from... anyhow, we watched it for a minute or two, and then it just disappeared, the trail ending abruptly. We remarked that that was odd, because we could no longer see the jet either.   A few seconds later, we noticed an object moving in a south easterly direction which meant it was horizontally moving right out where we were looking... which was to the north.  As it came closer, we could see that it was actually more of a stunted blimp shape, but cigar shape is the closest to it that you have for me to choose from here. I was, I believe either silver or gold... the sunset seemed to make it look slightly reddish, but I could tell it was not red. It moved slowly overhead..we could both see it clearly. We waited to hear a sound, so we could be sure whether we were looking a plane or not. One can hear the sound of a jet that is so high you can barely see it. This object was not that high at all. NO sound. Nothing. We both watched it until my daughter suddenly asked her husband to get the camera. He ran to get it, and she tried to get a shot of it, but said it didn't appear in her sights. It didn't register. It was pretty much gone by then anyhow. Just wish we had thought of the camera right off. Would have been a great photo opportunity. Her husband saw it too, but didn't seem interested. It was her birthday, so I just looked at her and said Happy birthday. You have seen your first UFO. The only reason I feel so is that this object definitely did not have wings, was certainly metallic (not a blimp) And was absolutely silent in its passage. I have obbserved this type of object before, and always, they are silent. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witnesses may have seen a contrail, being illuminated by the setting Sun.

I saw an object, flying, that I could not identify.;2005-07-23 13:10:00;5 minutes;I saw an object, flying, that I could not identify. I was driving North on the NW expressway, paralell to HWY 99(W), on my way to Belt Line Eastbound.  About 35 degrees up from the horizion, directly in front of me was a object, seemingly not moving in any direction I could tell.  It stayed there for about 5 minutes until I turned to head east.  I tried to keep sight of it out of the driver's side window, but was unable to.  At first I thought it was a plane, but it didn't have a visible vertical stabilizer or wings that I could see.  Also it was not moving across the sky in any direction.  It was silver, (or white?) much thinner than it was long and high in the sky.  The weather was clear, with no haze and the sun was behind me.  As far as background, I am a former ESL educator with a BA in East Asian History from the Universtiy of Oregon.;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981
Translucent object observed flying in the clear, blue afternoon sky.;2016-07-23 14:00:00;3-4 minutes;Translucent object observed flying in the clear, blue afternoon sky. We were traveling north on Beltline, when we first noticed an object flying in the cloudless, blue sky from west to east.  It appeared to be translucent and made me think of how an agate would look if it was held up to the sky.  It was quite small, longer than it was tall, but it definitely had a hump top & bottom about the middle of the craft.  We could see no wings,tail, or anything extending from the craft.  The speed was not too much faster than a commercial airliner, and we were able to watch it clearly.  The strangest thing about it was that it was completely invisible to our eyes when we tried to observe it after removing our sunglasses.  When we replaced our sunglasses it was clearly visible again.;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981
Cigar shaped craft seen northwest of Eugene at 9:30pm on May 14th;2021-05-14 21:30:00;10 min;Cigar shaped craft seen northwest of Eugene at 9:30pm on May 14th Sorry for not following the directions and using a word processor......                            While walking we observed a long cigar shaped craft to the northwest of Eugene. We watched it slowly move in a manner unlike any plane or balloon. It was grayish yet illuminated in such a way that seemed translucent We watched it for 10 minutes . We agreed that it was not a balloon and had no wings and it was silent .We tried to use our phones to record it but the lighting made it unviewable except for a blurry long light.I have always been a skeptic of UFOs but now im seeking more data to understand what it was we all saw. There was no propulsion system as it seemed to be using some other type of flight capability beside the conventional type...;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981
