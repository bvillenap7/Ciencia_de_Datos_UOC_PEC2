silent, black and X shaped;2007-09-03 07:45:00;15 minutes;My wife spotted something in the North East sky and ran in and got the binoculars while I kept track of it. It was silent, black and X shaped. It was too far off to get any real details but it was not a plane or balloon. It was moving very slow, almost stationary, just kinda hovering slowly away from us.;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981
