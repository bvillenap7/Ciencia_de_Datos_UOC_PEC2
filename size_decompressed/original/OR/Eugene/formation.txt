formation of lights 4 white 1 red with amazing sign-wave pattern over entire craft.;2006-10-08 18:30:00;2-3 min;formation of lights 4 white 1 red with amazing sign-wave pattern over entire craft. I viewed a formation of lights that came in from the north east and traveled south, four white lights and one red, they hovered in the sky briefly then flew directly over head, there was no sound and no contrail, these craft had no visible navigation or anti-colision lights.  I was amazed as they passed over head the craft were brightly lit, and the light seemed to move around them in a sign-wave pattern like you might see on a oscilloscope or frequency generator, and they were all at the same frequency.  I am a pilot and licensed mechanic with a strong background in engineering and design, I have been viewing aircraft for thirty years  I have never seen anything quite like this I had my camera and was able to get a couple of photos, these craft were faster than normal aircraft I only had time to point and shoot,  I think it is very notable that this sighting had taken place on a day with heavy (chem-trail) spraying?

Multiple lights in formation moving east to west and slightly upward ~ static video 5 min.;2016-11-09 01:00:00;5 minutes;Multiple lights in formation moving east to west and slightly upward ~ static video 5 min. I have a five-minute video, taken around 1am from approximately 18th & Chambers, looking north.  There were multiple lights, orange, traveling from west to east with a slightly upward arch.  They seemed to just disappear as they moved upward one by one in relative formation. I do NOT believe in the idea of aliens visiting our planet, but I am not able to identify what I saw or filmed on my android phone. I kept the image static, did not zoom in, and did not vocalize during the video.  You are able to see the lights and surrounding buildings in the frame.  Since I stopped in the middle of 18th street, occasionally a westbound vehicle is viewable as it passes by. I have not uploaded the image anywhere and have only shown it to a few friends to get their reactions and interpretations.  No one to this point seems to have come up with a plausible explanation. I've been unable to find any other reports of any celestial lights of this kind online.  I am not comfortable uploading the video but am willing to have anyone who's not a quack interested in viewing it to do so.  I am worried about uploading the video as I am NOT interested in having it show up on some TV idiotic show. Contact me via email or phone if interested. I would like someone to possibly tell me what these might have been.;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981
