Fireball of bright white light traveling from South to North.;2001-03-21 23:10:00;2.5 seconds;Fireball of bright white light traveling from South to North. My friend and I were outside , it was night time and a clear night. Plenty of stars visable when from the south came a streaking bright light and traveled north for about 2.5 seconds. At the end of this 2.5 seconds it became very bright white light , like a light bulb just before it burns out, and suddenly went dark. At first my friend and I thought it was a meteor. After thinking about what I saw I am not sure. The meteors I have seen in the past fizzle out. This thing became very bright and large. I can't really say how large but from the size of the light it was too big to have just went out. I would think that if it was a meteor it would have continued to move through the air and fizzled out.;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981
A glowing orange light moves swiftly and clean, then dissapears.;2009-07-15 23:28:00;35 seconds;A glowing orange light moves swiftly and clean, then dissapears. It was 11:28 pm on a Wednesday night. I was coming outside of my house to tell my sister she had to come inside, since it was getting late. When I walked toward her out of my front door, she asked “What is that light flying in the air”? As my sister, her friend, and I watched this light is started to move in a zigzag line. I told my sister to try to record it on video on her cell phone. As she started recording I ran inside the house to grab my mother’s video camera. When I ran out side the orange light had not moved much. As I tried to get a good shot of it on the camera, it kept moving. I then zoomed in on the object and it looked like it had markings on it. As I pressed the record button the orange glowing light disappeared. I have no clue what it could have been ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981
fireball over Eugene July 3rd;2011-03-07 22:00:00;2 minutes;fireball over Eugene July 3rd I actually did not see it, but I talked to two separate people who did. I think something weird passed over Eugene Or, at 11:00 pm on July 3rd.  My friend knows I am into UFO's (but does not believe himself)  called me on the 4th of July to tell me he and his girlfriend saw a silent fireball slowly moving across the sky from north to south around 11:00.  Not an airplane, firework, rocket , etc. It was flaming and it faded out he said.  About 2 weeks later I was having lunch with my brother and he said he, his wife and his whole neighborhood who was out shooting off fireworks saw the same thing fly over around 11:00 on the 3rd of July.  They all said the same thing, it looked like a silent, slow moving fireball and just crossed the sky, definitely was not a plane, fireworks, or Chinese lantern.

One orange glow traveling west at a steady speed;2011-12-31 22:50:00;30 seconds;My husband and I witnessed one orange glow traveling west at a steady speed similar to a plane. No sound was heard and it traveled in a fairly straight line.  There were no blinking lights as are typical to an airplane, instead it was a steady orange glow.  After approximately 30 seconds, it disappeared into the incoming fog. F or more clarification, it was not too foggy in our actual proximity, however, there was some light fog way overhead but mostly the fog was on the horizon.

They didn’t change direction or speed. traveled relatively slowly.  They were slightly bigger than average stars, obviously not stars.   Orange lightly twinkling but never fading or disappearing.

Viewed 4 slow moving orange-ish orbs on new years eve moving from E to W until they disappeared on the horizon.;2015-12-31 23:59:00;7 minutes;Viewed 4 slow moving orange-ish orbs on new years eve moving from E to W until they disappeared on the horizon Went outside with my boyfriend on New Year's Eve at around 12:55PM to light some fireworks to celebrate the new year.  While picking up the firework remnants, I noticed my boyfriend was staring up at the sky.  There were fireworks, but when they stopped, four slow moving orange-ish orbs moving from east to west traveled across the sky.  There were no flashing lights like a normal plane, and seeing fireworks just moments before, it was VERY clear these were not fireworks of any kind.   We watched them for quite a while and they did not dissipate-- they simply traveled until they were out of view.  For the most part they seemed spherical in nature, but if you focused closely they did appear to have some elongated part on the front.  A man down the path we were on also noticed them. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) My name is ((deleted)).  I submitted a sighting about 10 minutes ago.  I made an error in the submission--the number of witnesses was 3, and the duration of time was 7 minutes--not the other way around. Sorry for the error! Just wanted to mail to make sure all the information is accurate! Thanks again! ((END ADDENDUM)) ((NUFORC Note:  We have amended the report, as requested.  PD));44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981

February 12, 2018   We are a retired couple who live in Eugene, Oregon.   Today at approximately 18:45 hrs., we witnessed what appeared to be a fireball type object traveling from West to East in the Northern sky.   The wind was 16 mph from North, visibility was 10 miles, humidity 46%, clear skies with many stars visible.   We observed this object for about 3 to 5  seconds.   The object had the appearance of a clump of fire traveling horizontally across the sky.  The color was white with yellow orange and it left a short lived trail in its wake.  The object appeared to be about the size of Venus in the morning sky.  It moved quickly, but seemingly slower than a meteor.;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981
