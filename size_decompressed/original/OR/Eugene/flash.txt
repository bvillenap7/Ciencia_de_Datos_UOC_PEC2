Bright glowing orb, moving slowly then fading into the night.;2013-07-03 21:45:00;5 minutes;Bright glowing orb, moving slowly then fading into the night. Riding home on my bicycle this evening I saw a bright orange light in the sky that that grew brighter and moved slowly in the sky.  It was situated above West Eugene and moved too slowly and was up too high to have been a firework, nor could it have been a airplane because it moved too slowly and was moving vertically when it finally faded away. The UFO was looked like an orb and was a shining, bright orange.  It seemed to be quite small, maybe a few feet in diameter.  It stood out because it was much too big to be a planet or a star and did not move like a plane or a helicopter would.  When it when away, it faded very slowly and appeared to ascend further up into the sky.;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981
It looked like combat at near satellite altitude.;2018-01-23 02:00:00;10 minutes;It looked like combat at near satellite altitude.  There were several white flashes of different intensity.  First traveling west to east, then turning north. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.  PD));44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981
60deg up WNW, noticed a bright white flash about -4.0mag.;2018-03-31 22:45:00;12 minutes;My neighbor and I were standing in front of my garage talking, about 10:45pm, Saturday night, March 31st, when I looked up about 60deg up WNW above the trees across the street and noticed a bright white flash about -4.0mag.  Thinking it was possibly the ISS coming over, I told my neighbor to look also, but about 4 seconds later, we saw a much smaller flash about 2.0mag followed 6 seconds later by another brighter flash as the object moved very slowly from WNW toward the E. I went inside and grabbed binoculars while my neighbor tried to capture it on his Android phone. When I looked at it through the binoculars I realized it was actually two objects!  One following the other and both flashing at irregular intervals.  After watching them move slowly across the sky, the brighter one suddenly TURNED SOUTH, continuing to flash every 6-12 seconds for about 30 secs before disappearing. Never seen anything like that happen before. The dimmer object continued E also flashing at odd intervals until it moved past 90deg above us and began quickly fading as if it was going into the earths shadow. First thought was it might have been the Tiangong-1 space station, but a quick check online showed it nowhere near our latitude. A check of the satellite databases showed no objects matching the magnitude, altitude or azimuth observed for the time frame. Whatever they were they appeared to be very high altitude, possibly tumbling and moving very, very slowly compared to satellites or aircraft. Observer #1 has been an astro-imager and satellite tracker for 15yrs+, an aviation enthusiast for over 40 yrs, and has seen a lot of strange looking, but easily explainable, things in the sky.  These were VERY odd objects indeed!!   Observer #2 has had one other observation of different unknown objects 3 1/2 years ago about 2 miles from this location. ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly tumbling space debris, giving off intermittent reflections of the Sun??  PD));44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981

The object was probably flying overhead around 6:30pm or later but not after 7pm. I saw a flash of light that remained consistent for about 2 seconds then disappeared flying in 1 direction headed into some clouds and disappeared. It did not come out the other end of clouds. It was as if the craft sped up and shot some fire/light out and looked almost like it could have been a close falling star or meteor. I heard a very quiet rumble and it was almost silent. I said “What is that?” And my student then looked up and saw it too. She would not have noticed unless I said something. The reason I saw it was because I saw it out of my peripheral vision above as it shot very fast into the clouds. It came from an area of no clouds heading west and flew in a dart of light into some dark clouds and disappeared. I did not see it come out anywhere else. The entire event could not have lasted more than 2 seconds. I think I may have seen a stream of smoke or a trail out like a comet or a jet stream that only started from when I saw the flash until it went into the clouds. I was not sure if the shape was a ball or a dart shape. It may have been a military jet that was silent and doing night flying. I am not sure what it was. It was very fast and before it flash! ed it was completely silent and undetectable by sound or even sight. Like it appeared in the sky and flew fast like a comet and went into a cloud and disappeared. And yes it was way lower than any meteorite but way higher than a typical airplane flies and way faster than any commercial jet flying. I am 37 years old and college educated and a martial arts teacher.  My student is 45 years old and a mother and grandmother and married.  She works as a phlebotomist at a local hospital and is also educated.;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981

These bright flashes kept happening every few minutes. Then that 'star' disappeared. The flashes kept happening. That star reappeared. The flashes still kept happening.  Don't know what's lighting up a small portion of the night sky tonight.;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981
