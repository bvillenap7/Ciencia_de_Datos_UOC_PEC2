We have not way to verify authenticity of report, or witness.)) Yellow to Golden Orange object moving over central Eugene, appeared just smaller than a lentil at arms length, moving slowly west to east across partly cloudy sky.  I watched the object pass between the moon and myself and saw no physical body just the glowing globe and a slight residual light trailing upward. I ran to a nearby friends house and she saw it as well, then the object pulsated between bright and dim four times and streaked out of sight EastNE with amazing speed! I was in route to a friends house about ten blocks from downtown Eugene and noticed what I first thought to be a star or planet that was an interesting yellow/orange color, upon closer observation, the object appeared to be moving from west to east across the night sky, but made no sound.  I crossed the street to situate myself where I could watch the object pass the moon.  As it passed, I saw that there was no physical body to the object outside of the glowing ball and a slight residual light (same color) trailing upward.  I ran the remainder of the way to my friends house and got her to come outside as well.  The object was now some distance across town to the east, but still visable.  After aproximately five seconds, the object began to pulsate between a brillant light and fading out four times and then took off in a flash EastNE with amazing speed, leaving a meteorite like streak trailing behind it.;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981
Round, changed color, swerved, reversed direction without turning or stopping.;2001-09-09 23:00:00;1 minute;Round, changed color, swerved, reversed direction without turning or stopping. Two planes, one traveling North to South, one South to North. In between two planes, and closer to plane traveling North to South, and traveling North from the South,  was a light easily twice as large as any plane light, twice as bright, and traveling twice as fast.Light was roundish inshape, and chaning color every couple of seconds or so from a bright white with blue tinge to a orange-red. At one point I as the object was very close to the plane I thought That's awfully close and it swerved. Swerved quickly to the right, then swerved back again. A couple of seconds later it suddenly had reversed direction. It did not stop, then back up or turn...it just was going South to North one minute, then as it was stillmoving going bacwards, to the South, the next. I watched it until it traveled out of sight. My husband saw it at the end as it was moving South he said he did not think it was any brighter or different than anything else, which surprised me. It was hard for me to understand how he could say that. He did not observe it swerving or reversing direction.;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981
Brilliant, erratically zig-zagging,  fast-moving object in 4th of July sky at Eugene,Oregon;2004-07-04 23:00:00;2 minutes;Brilliant, erratically zig-zagging,  fast-moving object in 4th of July sky at Eugene,Oregon While watching neighborhood fireworks at my son's home in Eugene, Oregon, on July 4, 2004, between 10:30pm and 11:30pm I noticed a very bright spherical shaped light high in the sky to the slightly to the North.  I pointed it out to three others, my son, daughter-in-law, and friend.  We watched it for about two minutes as it continued North.  It was travelling at about 4 to 5 times the speed of a jetliner and zig-zagged erratically from side to side.  It was brilliant, brighter than the stars and any other object in the sky.  It was not an aircraft. After it moved from view we saw a satellite pass overhead.  The satellite was a small fraction of the brightness of this object.  I have practiced law for 24 years.  The others with me were all between 30 and 50 years of age.  This was definitely not an illusion or anything we've seen before.;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981
Sperical glowing craft over eugene oregon;2005-07-08 22:00:00;15-20 min;Sperical glowing craft over eugene oregon I was walking in westmorland park with my girlfriend and noticed a bright object in the sky. It was dusk but still light enough out to not see any stars yet and also rather cloudy. What caught my attention was that this bright light(brighter than any normal star) was really blue and moving.  Upon stopping and watching, it proceded to move about into and out of a large cloud and change color from blues to reds and whites. There was no way it was a plane or helicopter from its flight pattern. It stopped and moved in erratic directions in a way no human made craft could. Also it seemed to traverse vast distances across the city quickly but move like a butterfly with soft motion.  At one point it seemed very red and got long like a straight line with a hook on one end. There seemed to be 3 bright points, one at each end and one in the middle. Im interested if anyone else saw this.  My best guess is that it was over gateway/coburg area, possibly closer to downtown eugene. At one point it almost landed.  There were no noticable lights on the object, rather it seemed to completely glow and be made of light itself.;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981

Object was white changing to red then green then back to white.  Object was seen moving  and then hovering for a few seconds. It was not any type of aircraft and it made no sound.  I thought it looked like a giant laser pointer in the sky.  When it went across the sky, it went from the southern most horizon to the northern horizon in no more than 2 seconds.  I have never seen anything like this before.  After about 10 seconds object came out of the northern horizon back to its original position, all the while changing colors, again object made no sound.  Object then rose up to zenith above my head, pulsated colors for a few seconds and then disappeared.  The object was there one second and gone the next and did not return.;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981
2 lights in the night sky;2013-02-25 22:30:00;2 minutes;2 lights in the night sky When I first saw the two lights they were to the SW of my location, very close together, traveling in an Easterly direction. By the time I got my Flip camera they were moving in  a NE direction.  One started moving in a NW direction, it went behind a cloud and I didn't see it again.   The second light I caught on video. It went NE and came directly overhead of my location.  There was no sound associated with the lights. I am near an airport and see and hear airplanes, helicopters all the time but this was very unusual. Note:  The video appears as though the object is moving around in circles.  That movement is my unsteady hand.  Both objects were moving slow and steady with no jerky motion.;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981

3 very large red balls flying in a row about 1000 ft high,approx 500 ft apart from north to south west of Eugene;2015-04-18 21:30:00;60 seconds;3 very large red balls flying in a row about 1000 ft high,approx 500 ft apart from north to south west of Eugene I saw on 4-18-15 about 9:00pm, 3 very large red balls flying in a row about 1000 ft high, approx 500 ft apart from north to south west of Eugene.  The light went out in the middle one, I could see through binoculars that it was a black sphere of some kind as there was still a little light glow from sundown.  They were moving very fast, NO NOISE at all.  They disappeared just a little to the south west of Eugene, Oregon.   I have 20 hours training in a helicopter.  I've never reported before' I'm not a nut case!!!;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981

It caught the attention of myself and three kids, age 12 to 15, immediately as it lit up the sky as it flew by at speeds faster than any man made aircraft could do.  Possibly a meteor or space junk?

This was a twilight time-lapse video shot in Eugene, OR, on 2/25/2020.  The GoPro was set on night-lapse mode with automatic shutter and timing enabled.  Judging by the way the clouds were moving, it was taking a photo every 5-10 seconds. S o, the orbs were hovering very slowly in the sky and moving deliberately.;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981
