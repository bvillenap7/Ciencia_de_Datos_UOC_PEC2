Eugene, Oregon--On July 31st, 2005 at about 12:15,  I was sitting out by my mailbox reading and talking on the phone, when suddenly I saw something out of the corner of my eye...something bright.  I looked at it closely and thought, Oh, it’s just a plane maybe a shooting star?  Then I took a closer look, and there were green and yellow flashing lights on it.  It was moving at an incredible speed, I’d say around 1,500-2,000mph (literally).  The object appeared to be going in circles and blinking its lights rapidly.  I was literally shocked from what I saw. I said to my friend I gotta go bye and hung up.  I ran into my parents room, woke them up and had my mom run out to see it by the time we both got out there, it was gone.  She went right back to bed, and about five minutes later I saw another one (possibly the same one coming from a different direction).  I didn’t know what to think this time.  I ran inside again, except this time to get my camera. When I came back out with it, it was gone. So... I was hanging out in my backyard after that trying to spot another one (I had my camera at that time).  I spotted another for the third time!  I saw this one about 1:45a.m. It looked just the same. I got a picture of it this time. The picture is kind of hard to see, but if you zoom in, it’s a little easier to see. It didn’t look like the typical circular UFO shape, it looks to me like it’s more rectangular or platform-shaped.  The next day the news came to interview me  It was shown on the news that day (August 1st, 2005). That night, the newscaster called me up and said there were 30 other people that also saw it last night, they called the police and the police came!  They didn’t know what to think, they were just shocked.  The next day (August 2nd, 2005) a friend from church called my house and left a message saying that she saw th UFO as well around the same time of night too. Now... nobody knows what’s going on. ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what it was that this student may have witnessed, but it seems odd that none of the other alleged 30 witnesses has not submitted a report, as well.  We have received no other reports of the alleged incident.  PD));44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981

My neighbor and I saw a rectangle with bright blue and red lights traveling away and turning around at unexplainable speeds.;2015-06-30 21:15:00;4 seconds;My neighbor and I saw a rectangle with bright blue and red lights traveling away and turning around at unexplainable speeds. I live in Eugene, Oregon.  I live with my grown son in a trailer park, and I am very religious.  On June 30th, 2015, a little after 9pm,  I was standing outside my trailer to see the bright star of Jupiter and Venus together, which many have called the star of Bethlehem.  I waved for my neighbor to come off her porch and see.  We looked together for a minute toward the west, talking about how it has not happened in 2000 years since Jesus was born. I turned to go back to my home and she said, What is that?  I looked above my trailer in the sky and saw what seemed to be an invisible rectangular object with four sets of blue and red paired lights beneath it.  The bright blue and red lights were paired together in four places like where the wheels would be under a car.  We did not see the rectangle object, only the lights.  These were large lights, not tiny pin-sized lights. They did not blink, only glowed cobalt blue and bright red very vividly.  At first it was just hovering, then it went up, away south, around and back again and that is when I realized it was not a helicopter.  Nothing could travel or turn that fast that I have ever seen before. We watched until it went up and disappeared into the east. I had a strange feeling while watching that it had been looking at the stars as well, knew we were looking at it, and was trying to get away from us.  I don't know if that is true, it is just a sense I had.  I did not feel afraid, just calm and curious.  I brushed it off, since someone I later spoke with said it was probably a drone.  But after thinking about it, this was too big to be a drone, and much too fast.;44.0592636893205;-123.097035533981
