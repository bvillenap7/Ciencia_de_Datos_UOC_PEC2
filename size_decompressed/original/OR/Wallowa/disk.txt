Flying saucer type object not large and alone soft white light and incredibly fast.;2003-07-25 01:30:00;20 seconds;Flying saucer type object not large and alone soft white light and incredibly fast. Driving from Lewis air base in Washington to Wallowa lake in Oregon I was thirteen sitting in the back of our motor home when off to the left I saw an almost almond shaped soft white light about 300 feet up about a half mile away it was approximately 70 feet long and 20 feet tall it moved straight down about 150 feet then left to right and back 3 times in a zigzag pattern up to about 400 feet hovered at that height for 5 seconds and then flew up and to the right faster than I've seen anything ever move including super sonic air craft and for about 600 feet and then vanished.  my dog was agitated during the event.  This is first time reporting for fear of persecution and ridicule.;45.5694;-117.5391
