Sphere cluster release's smaller object's.;2004-05-08 13:45:00;20 min.;Sphere cluster release's smaller object's. With basically clear sky and a few scattered cumulus clouds, I spotted an object overhead that looked like usual balloon  at 5-10,000 feet? I Brought out my 8x42 binoculars and saw a sphere cluster (about 5 sphere's) with a cord hanging down and a small object at the bottom. This could still be  balloon's? Went to get 18x50 Image stabilized binoculars and noticed the cord and attached object had separated and was falling away. Size of sphere's about 5-10' diameter. Moving with upper level wind -west to east at about 10knots? Sphere's were not rotating or tumbling like balloon's would. Off-white in color. At about 10 min. duration , I noticed 3 smaller sized  object's (sphere's?) near but moving away from cluster. No  planes or confirmed balloons were in the area. 2min. later, noticed 3 more small object's closer to cluster and moving away at a slightly faster speed. After some distance away from cluster , smaller object's disapeared. Size difference between cluster and small object's would be like: pea to a golf ball. Then, focussing on cluster, I actually saw 3 more small object's being released by the cluster. Saw this repeat 2 more times. I have had similar sighting's in Lake Oswego, Oregon and much closer. As a long time skywatcher and up close daytime UFO witness, I believe this is not a balloon event and not ordinary. No photos or video taken. I am a pilot.
