As I was closing my door, I happened to look West in the sky and noticed what at first I thought was a meteor because of how bright orange the light was.  But I then noticed that there was not a tail of light or smoke at all.  The sky for the most part was clear with a few high thin clouds nothing really to block my view.   The light was traveling at some what of a slow pace, slow enough for me to pull my phone out of my pocket and contemplate filming the light.  But I ended up keeping my eye on it.  It flew from West to East in a straight line.  As it flew over my head, I tried to listen to see if it made a noise like some type of aircraft, but it was completely silent.  As it flew over my head the fireball started to dim, until it went completely black.  The strange thing was as the orange light disappeared I could see a fuzzy grey silhouette of what used to be glowing orange still heading east at! the same speed with no sound what so ever.  I know a plane tends to have white, green or red lights flashing but this was silent and bright orange and faded to a fuzzy grey.;45.35;-122.8559
