Disc.;2016-07-31 16:00:00;3 hours;Disc. Object was a saucer shape, white in color to half of it, and transparent to the other half.  It was tilted  at 45 degrees not rotating, but still and moving so slow as to appear motionless,  but took 3 hours to move from my Sherwood location to East to over Tualatin, OR, area.   Wind direction was from North to South blowing on the object, but no effect.   Appeared to be  as big as an airliner and about 10 to 20,000 feet high.  With my close up binoculars, I could see  evenly spaced ridges all around the rim perimeter.   I have video and still images.;45.35;-122.8559
