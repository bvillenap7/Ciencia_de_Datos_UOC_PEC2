I originally told Peter 5 secs duration, but it was more like 1-2 secs. the object was a large flaming (white) fireball with a tail and the flames seemed to be flickering even at a distance. Object descended and disappeared from view rapidly at an approximate 45 degree angle to the horizon, although since it was moving directly away from me, it was difficult to assess the angle of descent. I was surprised at the intensity of the light, since it was so close to the earth. I am a 64 year old male - former musician, and language scholar. I am returning to college for the first time in 20 years. I have seen one UFO in my life in 1954 while I was at Harvard. There was no question about that one.;45.3332;-118.0854
object looked like shooting star it turned green and glowing as it came closer to the ground increasing in size.;2003-02-09 20:55:00;about 5 seconds;object looked like shooting star it turned green and glowing as it came closer to the ground increasing in size. I seen what at first appeared to be a shooting star falling in the east vering to north slightly in a streight line. Usually they fade out pretty high  up in the sky. But this one kept coming closer and closer. The bright light I at first seen suddenly turned a bright green and increased in size to say about the size of a full moon at the highest point in the sky. It continued to fall until it was almost to the ground where I couldn't see it anymore it appeared to be about 18 feet from the ground. The height of a train car that was in front of me. From my line of vision it appeared to have gone down very close by. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at length, and she sounded quite serious minded and credible.  PD));45.3332;-118.0854

Located 1/4 mile from Morgan lake, a large, spark shooting green glowing fire ball was descending from East to West of the lake.;2008-09-12 20:15:00;10 seconds;Located 1/4 mile from Morgan lake, a large, spark shooting green glowing fire ball was descending from East to West of the lake. I was located about 1/4 mile west of Morgan lake just outside of La Grande Oregon watching tv at a friends.  He has very large windows that faces the hill on the other side of the lake.  In my periferal vision, I saw what I first thought was a firework, the object was far too large to be a form of firework, and as it decended it was shooting off sparks and glowed green.  The fireball was very large. I have no way to judge distance though on this object. I found it odd that there have been no reports that I can find in the local newspaper this the following day or on the internet.;45.3332;-118.0854
