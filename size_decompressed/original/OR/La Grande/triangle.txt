While star gazing, I spotted a black triangle overhead flying from East to West.;2015-09-17 10:22:00;5 minutes;On September 17, 2015 I was star gazing atop a local mountain range in Northeast Oregon.  The time was 10:22 P.M.  The sky was clear.  While star gazing I spotted a black triangle overhead flying from East to West.  This craft had  six bright white lights evenly spaced on the bottom of the craft.  In the center bottom of the craft was a rotating red flashing light.  However, my observation had only begun.   After watching the black triangle craft for a couple of minutes I noticed A SECOND TRIANGLE incoming from the North.  Shortly thereafter, the two black triangles joined at the hip and began flying side by side until out of sight, a short time later.  Both craft appeared to be of the same make and design. FINAL NOTE:  During the summer of 2014 I spotted two more of these black triangle craft.  The first craft I saw flying overhead in Pateros, Washington.  A few weeks later I saw another one of these craft flying over near Hanford, Washingtion.  Each black triangle craft have matched in size, lighting and performance.  These craft move very slowly as you may already know.  I ATTEST THESE STATEMENTS ARE TRUE AND ACCURATE TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY.  Thank You....;45.3332;-118.0854
