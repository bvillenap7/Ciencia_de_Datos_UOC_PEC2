5-9 tightly grouped objects in a line;2021-05-13 01:30:00;2-4 minutes;5-9 tightly grouped objects in a line I was hanging out smoking a cigarette in my car with my wife. I started looking at the stars because I noticed that they were alot more vivid then usuall. I then noticed what looked like 5-9 smaller yet distinctly brighter what I thought were stars all in a straight line. I watched for a moment and noticed that they were moving in a diagonal yet straight line all at once. At which point I asked my wife if she noticed It to and she laughed but said she had. It started getting a little brighter and started shrinking and the was gone. I've seen plenty of satellites and government and civilian aircraft and nothing can bend the laws of physics and move like that.
