Nightly aircraft seen over my town.;2013-07-22 02:00:00;every night almost;Nightly aircraft seen over my town. These things just float around  most of the time in the same direction until 2 days ago.  They look like silver balls from what I could tell and against the stars you can see them pretty well.  That's all I used to see until the 22nd when one streaked by very low around 3 to 4 am with a bright light.  I thought damn I barely got to see anything then looked in the other direction I usually look at then it came right in front of my view. these things don't usually have light but this one put on a quick show.  When a shark attacks you see its lid roll over its eye well that's what the light did over this ball.  It was more of a yellow then poof gone.  The weird thing is It was a full moon and clear sky but I don't remember seeing the big dipper which is plain as day tonight.   My internet was really screwed up the next day but sometimes charter isn't all that reliable.  I just wish I had a high powered telescope just to see them close up.;45.3332;-118.0854

Very clear night.  ((NUFORC Note:  Re-entering Chinese 3rd-stage rocket casing.  PD));2015-02-23 21:55:00;1 minutes;Very clear night. Stepped outside to check on cats and caught movement in the sky approx. 500ft. in altitude to the east, traveling south to north up the middle of the Grande Rhonde Valley.   Appeared to be a long tapered light approx. 100ft. long with a dark center with 2 bright dots in the middle, dim light as passing through a cloud on the top and bottom... although the sky was clear.  No sound whatsoever.   I watched the object fly straight and level for approx. 30 sec., and ran in to get my glasses, only to run back outside and see it fade away to the north behind some foothills.
