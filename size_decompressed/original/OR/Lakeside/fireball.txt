Orange orb (fireball) over Ten Mile Lake, in Lakeside, OR moving toward the coast, then south.;2015-07-03 22:18:00;4-5 minutes;Orange orb (fireball) over Ten Mile Lake, in Lakeside, OR moving toward the coast, then south. I was outside looking at the night sky to the west, deciding to go inside.  I then turned east and spotted a large orange orb in the sky.  It was very bright with points, as a star appears, but appeared to be an orange fireball.   Initially, I thought it was a fire work, then realized the size and direction and speed of travel ruled out the possibility of fireworks.  It was perhaps 100 ft. up, just above the trees, coming from Ten Mile Lake.   As it moved closer, the fire dimmed some and it appeared as an orange orb.  It was moving at a fair speed WSW flying adjacent to Hilltop Drive.  It then began to turn south and continued, moving out of sight beyond the treeline.   My daughter had come outside and witnessed the final moments, as it moved beyond our line of sight.  It was amazing.   Within 2-3 minutes, you could hear helicopters coming toward us heading in the same general direction that the orb went in.;43.584;-124.1573
