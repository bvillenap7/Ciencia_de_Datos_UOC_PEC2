I stepped outside on my front porch to have a cigarette at approx. 9:18 pm pacific time. When I looked up I saw a bright light in the southern sky, roughly 50° - 60° off the horizon l have no reference or estimate for distance, but the light was similar to that of seeing a planet like Jupiter on a clear night.   As I watched it, the light faded until it could no longer be seen.  The whole event was very short (about 6 seconds) yet certainly grasped my attention.;45.2897;-122.3219

They were orange in color, traveled at what a satellite would cross the sky, they were in a perfect line, all appearing in the same spot and disappearing in the same spot 2/3 the way across the sky towards the east.   I called for my wife to come see what I was seeing and she saw at least 7 or 8 and went back inside because it was cold.  As I continued to watch I started noticing that it appeared that random stars would start moving in all different directions to many to count.  Went back out half hour later, gave it 10 minutes and didn't see anything further.  I didn't bother trying to video, it was dark and my phone takes terrible videos.;45.2897;-122.3219
