Red orb over Clackamas County, Oregon;2007-03-08 23:00:00;5-8 seconds;Red orb over Clackamas County, Oregon I was lying in my bed trying to go to sleep. It was around 11:00 PM. I repositioned my body to face the window. I was having trouble sleeping so I got out of bed to close the window because the coyotes were outside howling. As I closed the window I looked outside and saw a solid red orb shaped object coming from the west.  It was moving very fast. I am pretty sure that the object I saw was the one that was seen in Port Orchard, Washington. It came from the west and kept going east. It was not blinking or leaving a trail. It made no sound that I heard. It was much lower in elevation than the picture that was taken in port orchard. It stayed in my sight for about 5-8 seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));45.2897;-122.3219
