I was looking at the moon above the horizon.  Maybe 10 degrees south or to the right of the moon almost the same horizontal elevation as the moon.  Something tubular or cigar shaped, looked almost stationary with no lateral movement.  But maybe rotating was light in shading, color blind, so can’t tell, but if to guess a tan color.  Like flares on satellites it got brighter and at one point looked like a light shining like a spotlight.  Then dimmed and disappeared.  Scanning the sky’s I lost sight of it and then it caught my eye again.  Didn’t appear to move, but I was driving.   Drove the rest of the way to my house and looked up and saw the flash which seemed to last for several seconds.  Then lost sight of it, not to see it again.  Also, there were four jets flying at high altitude, one was flying to the east of the craft flying north to south.  Another was to t! he west and flying about east to west.  The third, was first and it appeared to alter its path around the objust, it was south of the object flying south to north and if not altering course, may have intercepted the object.  A fourth, was a couple minutes behind the third and followed the same path but according to the condensation trail which faded quickly, altered path at a earlier space.  Could have been a radiation detection balloon, but never saw one of those before.;45.2897;-122.3219
