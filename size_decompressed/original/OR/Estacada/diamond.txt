There’s two moons!”  As my eye was drawn to where he was pointing I noticed the shimmering shape hovering in the sky.  It was a small diamond shaped craft covered in bright bands of light that seemed to brighten and then dim as it wavered in the air, preventing me from being able to determine what size the craft truly was.  The craft appeared to be an entire rainbow of colors which could only be seen when it turned tail and flew off about a minute later.  Instinctively, I grabbed my phone and took a short video of the craft before ducking for cover so it could not spot me. In practice, I am a Healthcare Professional, but ever since I watched “Close Encounters of the Third Kind” as a child I have had a profound interest in Extraterrestrial activity on Earth.   My boyfriend is generally supportive of my interests and is also intrigued by the Paranormal.  Together we have taken a few trips to famous UFO sighting hotspots with no luck until now.  We both hope that this video can aid its viewers in the search for the truth.;45.2897;-122.3219
