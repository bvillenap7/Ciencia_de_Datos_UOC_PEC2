The light came shooting over real fast, then turned, and flew at a 90' angle, then stopped again, and did a loop, and flew back over the mountain out of sight then it flew back over again really fast then stopped. It then just flew around. It definately was not the planet I thought it was.We have seen it many times since, and my friend has seen it many times before. It seems to be in the same area every night doing something.;45.2897;-122.3219
