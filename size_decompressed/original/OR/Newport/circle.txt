At about 1:00 am i witnessed a large ball of light fall out of the sky. it happened pretty fast. It was like something i've never seen before. My friend saw it at the last second before it went over the horizon. About five minutes later my friend saw one northbound. ( the previous one was east) It was pretty bright. it had had a slight green glow around it. after these sightings we spent a little over an hour watching the sky, there was no more activity so we went home.;44.6479;-124.0507
