Orange oval floating light on ocean unaffected by waves speeds up and slows down on the water.;2014-04-09 23:00:00;~1 hour;Orange oval floating light on ocean unaffected by waves speeds up and slows down on the water. Two friends and I were having a bonfire on the beach at seal rock in Newport.  There was a bright orange light (the same color orange as our fire) out behind this rock in the ocean. You could see the brightness of the light just beyond the top of the rock.  The light then moved on top of the rock at which point we assumed it was someone that had built a fire just like us.   Slowly the light moved off the rock and made its way across the ocean.  It did NOT bob in the waves, waves did not crash over it but yet it seemed to be floating right there on the ocean.  The light would speed up and slow down randomly.  It was a constant orange glow unaffected by the waves of the ocean and it eventually went around the bend of a giant rock and disappeared.;44.6479;-124.0507
