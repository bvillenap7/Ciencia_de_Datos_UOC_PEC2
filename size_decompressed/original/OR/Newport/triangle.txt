newport,oregon  ufo;2008-02-12 01:00:00;3hrs;newport,oregon  ufo   started around midnight on feb 12 2008, I thought i was seeing an airplane, around 1am I then witnessed the same object had moved from south to south west keeping the same height in the night sky, got curious when i noticed red green purple blue lights flashing, I grabbed my telescope and saw a craft, I saw a space ship not a light, i saw a craft surrounded by lights blinking, it was gray metal looking with balls of lights on the outer edge of the craft, i was also able to zoom in to see outlines or designs, hard to explain looked like it was a seem on the ship or something outlining the edge of lights it was more arrow shaped bottom was indented like an arrowhead.( the bottom part),it was floating facing if that is the front towards outer space floating clockwise in a circle. I lost it in the sky my neighbor also saw it with me, i later around 2:20am notice it again but was too far, I only could make out the lights it was due west over the ocean, got my telescope again and saw it fly away into space.;44.6479;-124.0507
