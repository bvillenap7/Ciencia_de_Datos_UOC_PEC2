I am not sure of an exact time as I didn't even know I had photographed this object, until I uploaded pictures from my camera.  I was taking a picture of a helicopter that flew over.  I carefully checked the picture I actually got of the helicopter and there is nothing else in the frame.  The UFO picture was a total miss of the helicopter as I tried for a 2nd shot.  I saw this white speck in that frame and enlarged it has more of an elliptical shape which drew me away from my initial assumption that it might be a balloon (it's way too early for one of the eclipse balloons).  So I decided to keep the shot and send it to you.   It was not the moon as that came up in a different quadrant of the sky, later that evening.  It was difficult, at this distance to give many descriptors, including aura.  There was no sound but the helicopter.;44.9929;-122.7659
