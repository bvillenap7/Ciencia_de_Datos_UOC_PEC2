3 orange orbs flying over silverton oregon;2010-02-19 09:00:00;4 minutes;3 orange orbs flying over silverton oregon 2 of my friends noticed 3 orange orb looking lights flying slow not making any sound with no blinking lights flying from east to west in triangle formation about 500 feet above their house. My friends then told me and my other friends to come outside. When I got out side I noticed right away 3 different orbs flying in a triangle the orbs then moved out of formation circled around each other and then made a perfect horizontal line and started flying in formation again. Then all at the same time they sort of just dimed out. This all happened within 4 or 5 minutes they most have traveled across the sky 6 or 7 miles. These lights were like nothing I have ever seen before. They were so intelligent and magical. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.

Bright white light in night sky flashed, moved to the right, then faded out.;2016-08-21 23:00:00;2 minutes?;Bright white light in night sky flashed, moved to the right, then faded out. We was with a group of four people. We were in our backyard in Silverton, Oregon.  We were camping outside at around 11:00 pm looking up at the stars, when suddenly, there was a really really bright light that at first we thought was a star.  It was the same size and color as a star but it was super bright.  We thought it might be a planet but we used an iPhone app to look at the planets and the light didn't show up on the app even though a star right next to it, called Deneb, did.  All of a sudden, the light flashed.  We watched it start to move to the right but suddenly the light faded into the dark night sky.   We waited for it to come back but it never returned.;44.9929;-122.7659

Four of us were outside camping in Silverton, Oregon, looking at the stars.  We suddenly saw a very bright light, about the same size, shape and color as a star but way brighter.  It moved to the right all of a sudden, flashed once, then faded out.  We kept watching for it but it never came back.;44.9929;-122.7659
White, trailing light observed by multiple witnesses in Oregon;2019-04-03 22:30:00;10 minutes;White, trailing light observed by multiple witnesses in Oregon On the night of July 3rd, 2019, I attended a 4th of July fireworks display at The Oregon Gardens with my date, 3 of her sisters, and one of their boyfriends.  After the fireworks we were walking back to our vehicles when we decided to stop at the Community Skate Park and hang out and talk etc.   We were lying on our backs in the skate bowl looking up at the sky.  The sky was patchy with clouds with the stars visible clearly between the clouds.  There was no moon and we were far away from strong sources of light pollution.   After a few minutes my date and I noticed a small speck of white light with what appeared to be a tail trailing behind moving against the background of the stars.  We both commented that it looked like a single sperm “swimming” among the background of the stars and going behind the clouds seemingly in a random, “searching” pattern zig-zagging around seemingly aimless.  We observed the light for several minutes, not less than 5 and not more than 10 perhaps.  There were no flashing lights, and the “object” itself was very faint and difficult to make out and several times we lost it behind a passing cloud only to pick it back up when it emerged on the other side.  My date and I and at least one of her sisters witnessed the same phenomena we did but the light was very faint and I am unsure if everyone present was able to positively see the object.  Several times we saw definite and easily identifiable airplanes and we were certain that it wasn’t one of them, it appeared to be much “higher” and had no flashing or blinking lights and made no sound that we could make out.  At first I took it to possibly be a satellite but I am unaware of any that changed direction like this object did.  At some point it went behind a particularly large cloud and we were unable to see it afterward.  We were all 100% sober and ranged in age between 16-35.;44.9929;-122.7659

One following the other until they both disappeared into the clouds. I thought, could've been two military jets? I doubt it, they moved faster than any military jet. Both objects had a brilliant white light not flashing, moving northeast towards Pendleton, Oregon. Duration of sighting was no less than 10 seconds and no more than 15 seconds.;44.9929;-122.7659
