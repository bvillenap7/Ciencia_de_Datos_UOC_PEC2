2 fireballs and a cylinder shaped craft spotted in Eastern Oregon.;2012-10-20 06:00:00;5-10 minutes;2 fireballs and a cylinder shaped craft spotted in Eastern Oregon. Just reviewed the tapes of that night and I am ready to go into detail about our sighting. This happened on 10/20 at 6:45 at the end of Walls Rd. in Hermiston, OR.   We stopped to take pics of the feedlot and my husband saw the UFO's.  There were 2 in the sky.  They looked like fireballs to me. Positioned low on the horizon to the East.  They did not appear to move back, forth, up or down but were floating and definitely headed away from us. They slowly faded from sight.   What I caught on video matches my description but the still shots I got were completely different.  Once I zoomed in and got an up close look these UFO's looked like the number 7.  Perfectly printed # 7.  Also cloud like in color and consistency.   We jumped in the truck to chase these things, hoping to see more and saw something totally different but just as strange.  We headed east down Holdman Road towards Pendleton. When my husband spotted something and said to pull over.  What I saw was what look to be a cylinder shaped cloud.  My husband had a powerful spotting scope and said the UFO had exhaust or smoke coming out of it.  This UFO was flying very fast from the left along the horizon into the rising sun in the East.  I did get some video that shows nothing and some pics that you can see it in the far distance. What I thought was strange was a military jet passed over us, flying towards the UFO.  I also got pics of the jet.  The sun rose that morning at 7:22 which ended our sightings for that day because the UFO disappeared into it.;45.8486;-119.2848
