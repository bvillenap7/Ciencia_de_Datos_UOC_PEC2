I first observed this object directly overhead moving from 90 degrees toward the South and East until it faded out like a shooting star does.  This object was very bright, maybe twice as bright as what I think Venus is in the Western sky.  This object moved from directly overhead to 20-30 degrees over the horizon before it faded out.  It took about 1minute maybe slightly longer for this to take place.  I never saw it appear, I just stepped out the door and looked up when I observed it.  Later that night, maybe half an hour later I observed another thing very similar to this only it appeared and dissappeareed in a matter of 5 or 6 seconds.  Both moved far too slow to be shooting stars, and they seemed to be moving far too fast to be conventional aircraft.;45.8486;-119.2848
