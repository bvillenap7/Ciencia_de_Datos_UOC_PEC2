V Light Formation;2009-04-16 02:00:00;8 seconds;V Light Formation April 16 2009 around 1:30 am on a very clear night,the stars were all visible.   After taking the garbage out I decide to take a look into the night sky as I normally do in hopes to see something unusual or out of the ordinary.  As I look up something caught my eye and at first glance it appeared to be geese flying in a V formation but as I watched I noticed no movement of individual wings or sound.  There were 7 white oval objects/lights that were slightly illuminated and in a V formation. It also moved faster than a flock of birds would travel never altering the V formation.  As it began to move from my sight it turned slightly up and out of view.   Not sure what it was and was wondering if anyone else may have seen this? It flew from the south/west to the north/east.;45.8486;-119.2848
