We looked up and there was three bright flashes of blue light, then 3 rhombidodecahedron-shaped crafts flew not 100 feet overhead. they flew off, for what must of been a mile, all the while doing odd-shaped cirles, and disapeared off in the night sky. Then we found that our flashlights and watched had stopped working. We were terrified, so we called the police, but they weren't any help and just said we imagined it all. We couldn't sleep for days.
