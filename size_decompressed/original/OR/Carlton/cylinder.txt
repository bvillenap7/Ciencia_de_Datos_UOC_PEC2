My twenty year old daughter and I were driving about fifty miles per hour when I looked up to my left into the sky and saw something hanging there motionless.  It was about one-hundred feet in the sky.  It was totally still, and as we got closer I told my daughter to look.  What is that, I said?  She goes, I don't know..that's weird.  As we got closer to what was just hanging there in the sky, it almost looked like a bird's nest or a bunch of branches together kind of in the shape of a cigar.  Nothing was around it, nothing could have been holding it up in the sky.  I had never seen anything like it before.  This was halfway between Mcminnville Oregon and Carlton out in the country.  There was no wind at the time.;45.2855;-123.153
