Triangle shaped craft with no noise. Very low.;2012-12-13 15:50:00;1 minute;Triangle shaped craft with no noise. Very low. A friend saw this craft as he was coming to my house and was able to get a photo of it.  I saw the photo and it resembled a Stealh fighter, but the rear configuration was rounded, not trianguler like the stealth fighter.  It also had two white spots near the front and greenish color on the bottom.  And he said it very fast.  I was in my shop at the time, which faces the of the sighting location and did not hear any jet sounds and he did not hear any sounds either.  I have seen stealth fighters and this was not one.  Also the cloud cover was very low, less than 1000 ft.  It was going south to north.  And left no jet trail.;45.2855;-123.153
