Saw a 2 tailed chevron shaped object, head like a snowball flying over Cascades, possible Vandenberg missile?;2002-10-14 19:05:00;15-30 seconds;Saw a 2 tailed chevron shaped object, head like a snowball flying over Cascades, possible Vandenberg missile? This evening just past 19:00, I saw an unusual white cloudy object over the Cascade Range SW of my location (6 miles N. of Madras).  The object appeared to be traveling N to NW at high altitude.  It was chevron shaped, with two tails and a snowball shaped head.  My grandson, who lives 7 miles S of my location, called and said he saw it, but saw a red glow that I could not see from my location.  The object looked similar to a Minuteman Missile Launch that we saw on 10/2/99 at 19:08, when we were 5 miles above Prairie City, Oregon (see NUFORC).  I checked the Vandenberg AFB Launch Schedule website which indicated a launch was planned for this evening at 19:00.  I called the Redmond Airport, but they were closed.  The Madras sheriff said they had gotten several calls and the Bend TV station KPTV said they had gotten calls. ((Vandenberg rocket launch.  PD));44.6389;-121.1397
