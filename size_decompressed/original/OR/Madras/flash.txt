Blue flashing light (Basket ball) sized.  Fast Mover.;2009-05-03 04:30:00;30 sec +\-;Blue flashing light (Basket ball) sized.  Fast Mover. I was traveling north on hwy 97 approximately 5-6 mile north of Madras, Oregon 4:30 AM.  In the distance I could see a blue flashing light in the road ahead.  It appeared to be about a half a mile (I guess) ahead of me and not moving.  The weather was high overcast and dry.  My first reaction was, it was a police car.  I began to slow down and as I approached, the light began to move away from me at a speed about double of my speed.  I was moving about 65 mph.  It was moving so fast I was trying to figure out how it could be a car.  The light still flashing at the same rate turned +/- 90 degrees and moved west into a very large irrigated field.  My guess it was 5 -10 feet off the ground and did not move up or down.  It looked to be about the size of a basketball.  Again it was dark and I did not have any references to compare it to.  It traveled out what appeared to be about a 1/8 - 1/4 mile and turned south now going the opposite direction I was moving.  I followed it visually the best I could.  After it passed my sideways field of view I began to watch it in my mirror.  It went past me a little further (hard to tell how far in the dark and I was still moving fairly fast).  It looked like it turned 90 degrees again and came back to the road.  The light looked as thought it came up behind me and I lost sight of it.  I did not see any residual light flashing around my vehicle.  Again it happened very fast (30 seconds +/-) and I was watching the road at the same time this was all going on.  I was driving a 2005 Ford pickup.  The exterior mirrors are large and it also has an interior mirror.;44.6389;-121.1397
