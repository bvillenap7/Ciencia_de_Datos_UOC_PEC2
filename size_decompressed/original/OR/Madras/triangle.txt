Everone else was sleeping.  I was relaxing before bed  .I could view most of town.  I heard a small private plane passing overhead.  I was just observing it.  When a streak, like a lightning bolt, yet straight and curving, came into view. It seemed to want to intercept the small craft and flipped under it.  That is when I could see it shape. Maybe 2000 feet above me.  When it flipped underneath the airplane it briefly slowed. It had an arrowhead shape.  And it had white small starlike camo pattern. As if it could simply hover and not be seen.  Anyway I could make out everything but the tail section. It at this time sped like an arrow across the sky due north.  Funny thing, it made no noise. All I could here was the small plane travelling north by northwest.  I thought it shape to be like a stealth fighter.  It did not frighten me, and that surprised me.  The next day I told my wife and she believed me.  She had a story of her own.  The in-laws ribbed me . But the next night, The Phoenix Lights were on the headline news.The in-laws looked at me in amazement. After that night, I believed it could hover as well. I listen to talk radio at night. And listen to Mr. D. , and felt it was time to share this event, after some 33 years. Then I told my sister. She and my nephews had seen the same shaped object just months apart. This is a true story. Thanks;44.6389;-121.1397
