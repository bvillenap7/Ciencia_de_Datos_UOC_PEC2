Line of 27 or more white lights traveling across sky.    ((Starlink satellites??));2020-03-02 05:45:00;5 minutes;Line of 27 or more white lights traveling across sky. I saw the strangest thing, was outside at 5:45am it was still dark and I noticed what looked like a satellite passing quickly overhead, I didn't give it much thought till I saw another behind it then another.  Counted at least 27 solid white lights moving quickly in line some closer to each other but most spaced evenly.  No colored lights no flashing, all were just solid white. Travelled from west by southwest to east by north east above madras oregon. May have been more then 27 because I only stared counting after I realised there was several.  Out of the 27 counted, one was flying parallel but slightly north of main line, and aproximatly two were travelling directly behing another one which was in the evenly spaced line.  I Watched for about 5 minutes till I didn't see any more.;44.6389;-121.1397
