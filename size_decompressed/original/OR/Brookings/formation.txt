I was photgraphing another object at the time. I think it was chasing the dark one. Tonight I was just transferring pictures from my old camera to my laptop.  After transferring the photoes I opened the file with microsoft picture viewer.  Two of the pictures I took were of the night sky. as my fiance and I were On vacation.  In Brookings Oregon at Harris beach look out Parking lot on top overlooking the entire ocean  The sky was clear as a bell. I took a picture of what I thought was a bright star or rogue satellite.  It was pretty so I took a total of 6 pictures, 4 that I deleted at the time because I thought they were just bad pictures.  Tonight I noticed in the two remaining pictures. a Long, square, cigar shaped thing. its not really cigar its kinda boxed but in irregular not so perfectly even on all sides.  The thing covered the bright object I was aiming at to take a picture of in the first place. Anyway I dont know what to think of the pictures I am not an expert photographer, nor a ufo buff. maybe its something, maybe its not.  The odd t! hing that I noticed their were no lights, flashes, glowing etc.  The norm by ufo sighting of all sorts shapes and sizes. But the creepy thing that disturbs me. just What if aliens are smarter than to use lights but absolute darkness.;42.055;-124.2803
