I was road tripping from San Fran to Port Angeles, Wahington. I took the 101 as far north as route 42s in oregon. I was in no rush and camped at several places for several days while on the road. One of the places I camped was Harris beach state park north of Brookings Oregon, on the south coast. It was about 1.45 am and i had all my gear set up and had just fed the dog. I layed down on the picknic table to watch the stars, the night was very clear and the stars were beautiful. Then as i was looking strait up I saw an interesting object that was moving slowly in the sky i thought it was a satelite. During my trips across the counrty i have seen many satelites and have even tracked them through websites. This object that i thought was a satelite was that high up, just a dot,it had a red tint and was definatly not in our atmoshere. After The object had caught my eye for about 5 seconds it did an amazingly fast j turn. Moved in the different direction for another few seconds and then dissapeared. The j turn is the best i can explain it. The turn was not a sharp angle but kind of like a loop. I didnt see anything else like it the rest of the night. It definatly sped up for the loop, during the loop and then slowed down again before it dissapeared. what did i see? sattelites dont do that. do they??;42.055;-124.2803

As I went to see what the fuss was about, my dad had said LOOK AT THE LIGHT!!! I saw it up in the sky a werid light that was flashing blue and red! I thought to my self WHAT THE F.... but then it would moved REALLY FAST to left and then the right then move up and down then judt sit there. My family watched it for about an hour. After we had awaken we looked out to see if it was still there...it wasn't. I looked online to see if anyone else had seen the same thing and NASA had an article about it and I guess all it was..was a LONG-PERIOD METEOR how cool was that. They have a article that it's:On Sept. 1, 2007, bright and oddly-colored meteors might come from the constellation Auriga. ... Aug. 13. Plus, a popular planet shows up in the night sky. ...

Glowing Orange light seen in Sky over Brookings Oregon;2012-01-17 05:36:00;5 minutes;Glowing Orange light seen in Sky over Brookings Oregon I was standing outside my porch investigating the storm we are having with 70 mile and hour winds.  Our House is roughly 5 blocks inland from the Ocean.  I looked to the ocean and above the waterline in the midst of the overcast was a bright light fading in and out but getting bigger as the the minute went by.  I called my kids outside to see the light and they witnessed it too.  They ran and got the binoculars and we could clearly see it was an orangish colored light.  It then moved North and disappeared. I called the coastguard to see if they were crazy enough to have any rescue helicopters out and they confirmed the winds were too strong and did not have any flying in the area.  The hole incident lasted about 5 minutes.;42.055;-124.2803
