Bright red lights seen in Curry County.;2010-10-19 20:30:00;30 minutes;Bright red lights seen in Curry County. It was about 8:30 pm when I went to take the trash out, as I look up at the stars facing east is when I see two bright red balls of light. I only had about two seconds to look at them before they vanish, these lights were stationary when I observed them. I ran to my neighbors house to get them, and we stand out there for no more than a minute before I look to the south east and there the bright red lights were again this time the lights were pulsing the highest ball of light first then the second, third, and fourth all lit up in an arch shape before vanishing, these lights were also stationary at the time. No activity was seen again for about 30 seconds until I look south again, I see two bright white/orange colored lights flying across the sky headed north at a very high speed. I observe the two objects for approximately one minute before the lead light vanishes and the one that was trailing it goes out on my line of sight behind the mountainside. It was a clear night, and the moon was very bright.;42.055;-124.2803
