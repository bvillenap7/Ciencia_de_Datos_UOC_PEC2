My wife and I noticed spheres moving in alignment moving faster than aircraft.  ((Starlink satellites??);2019-12-23 18:23:00;7-8 minutes;My wife and I stepped out to patio at Smith river facing west, and noticed spheres moving in alignment moving faster than aircraft or satellite, at a high atmospheric level.  Our best estimate is over 30 craft moved in a westward direction, but disappeared before leaving line of sight.;42.055;-124.2803
