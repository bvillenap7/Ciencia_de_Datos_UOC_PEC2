My wife and I both watched a very bright, white-blue diamond shaped object cross the sky from west to east, it stayed at the same speed and brightness the whole time. I looked at it through binoculars and could see that both front and back ends were  pointed, though the front end was not as sharply angled. The light seemed to come from inside the object, it made no sound.;42.055;-124.2803
