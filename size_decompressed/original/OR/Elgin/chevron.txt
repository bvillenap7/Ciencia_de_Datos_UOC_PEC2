It was V shaped with five orange lights on the perimeter and one white ligh in the center of craft. Altitude: aprox. 2000'.speed: guess- 1100mph. It traveled in straight line over the mountains out of sight. At 10:30pm on 10/10/99, my husband went outside to lock the car he looked up to a cloudless sky to see an craft traveling north northwest directly over our house.  He immediately ran into the house and yelled at me to hurry outside.  I ran out to the front yard in time to see a craft in the aparent shape of a V lined with orange steady glowing lights.(two on each angle and one in the front) as well as a bright white (search light style) light directly in the center of the V.  It is dificult the estiimate the altitude, but I would guess it to be aprox. 2000 feet traveling at a speed of 1100 mph.  It traveled in a direct line over the mountains and disappeared behind them.  We are in the direct flight path of commercial aircraft traveling to Seattle and Portland or Kennewick, WA.  We have ovserved them many times.  This craft did not follow the normal flightpath of these flights.   This is the second craft of this type that we have observed in a two year period both traveling in the same direction.;45.5931;-117.9056
