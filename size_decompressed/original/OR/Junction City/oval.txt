My wife took video of a orangish / pink object eratically moving in the sky above Eugene Oregon.;2020-04-08 22:30:00;5 minutes;My wife took video of a orangish / pink object eratically moving in the sky above Eugene Oregon. My wife was taking pictures of the full moon on the night of April 8th around 10:30 pm when she notices a orangish pink object moving erratically in the sky.  She started to video the object.  She got 1 minute and 45 seconds of the object flying around.  Then the object disappears twice and at the 12 second mark it lets out a flash of light, similar to sheet lightening.( looks like it was hit by something)  At about 1 minute and 38 seconds it disappears two more times and another bright light flashes across the sky.  This time it leaves a trail and disappears.( looks like it was shot down by something).  My wives phone battery instantly discharges to zero charge and shut off. We had no cloud cover that night and no planes were flying in or out of the airport at that time. I will send the video to back this up.  Thanks;44.1988;-123.23
