Looked metallic gray and was tilted at about a 45 degree angle, bottom visible.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly Sirius??  PD));2020-04-11 20:00:00;45 minutes;Looked metallic gray and was tilted at about a 45 degree angle, bottom visible. My daughter and her friend, my granddaughter and I were on our porch this evening at 8:00 p.m. The weather was clear and warm.  My daughter said to look at an object in the sky that seemed to be flashing colors of white, red and blue.  It seemed to be about 20 percent larger and closer than stars or maybe even the moon.   I went into the house and got my binoculars, and we each had a turn or three looking at this object.  It looked to me like it was at least the size of two of the largest passenger planes wide, and was of circular shape.  There was one large light in the center of the bottom that was brighter than the other lights that were surrounding that center light.  All of the lights were white, but would change to either blue or red.  The craft was quite clear in my binoculars.  It seemed like it was in our atmosphere, and maybe lower to earth.  We four discussed the possibility of a weather station or a large satellite.  Just the history of reports of! UFO’s describing the disc like or saucer shape, prompted me to report this siting.  I went back into the house about 8:30 p.m., after our social distance visit,  and got my camera and tried to capture the image, but couldn’t find it again.  I took pictures, anyway, thinking it might show up on digital, but it did not show.;44.1988;-123.23
