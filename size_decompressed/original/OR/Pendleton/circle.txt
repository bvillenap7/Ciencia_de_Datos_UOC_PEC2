Smoke break ufo sighting.;2020-03-20 21:00:00;Night;Smoke break ufo sighting. I was outside of my tribal housing residence with a friend of mine smoking a cigarette. I was looking up at the clear sky looking towards the venus planet SE of my hounding unit. N I have seen many UFOs since 1982  ,so I know how to identify them.  The ufo was high in the sky, a golden light without any normal flashing plane lights.  It was moving faster than any planes, in which I've noticed a lot fewer in the last 3 weeks of the Corinavirus.  I asked my friend if he had his phone, n he said no but did see what I was looking at.  I went inside to get my phone n it was less than 30 seconds I returned it had already passed by. No planes ever flew over my area so I know that it wasn't on a normal flight plan.  I would estimate this to be a golden glowing orb approximately 3k' in the air.  No sound, n faster than normal planes.  We're located by a airforce/Airport of the famous Doolittle Raiders, n the Renounced Black airforce group.  So I've seen 5 here since 1998.  One I seen in 2010 over I-84 east bound I call the SILVER SURFER.  This caused cars n semi trucks to slow down on the highway from 60 mph to 50ish so they can see the approximate 100' long surf board shaped vessel with5a with a silver white tail/trail that extended approximately 200 yards. I watched it follow the highway east bound n disappear over the hill CALLED CABBAGE HILL, part of the the cascade mountain range. One last year or before as well. I've seen a lot of cryptoids, aliens, paranormal stuff since I was 9 years old. Under oath on a stack of Bibles I'm telling you the truth. Thank you, n I enjoyed you in Everett WA last year I wanted to tell you my stories but due to time constraints,n my mom's birthday. Which also seen the things I've seen too.;45.6634;-118.7791
