Unkown light in sky over Pendleton, OR.;2015-05-17 22:18:00;10 minutes+;Unkown light in sky over Pendleton OR I am a truck driver. I was heading westbound on interstate 84.  Around 22:00 as I rounded a curve close to the 228 milepost I saw a very bright white light in the sky about 35 degrees in the sky.  I was on the phone with my wife when I first spotted the light. I pulled off into the west bound truck scale and proceeded to look at the light through 7x50 binoculars.  I couldn't make out much detail as I was unable to hold the binoculars steady.  To the naked eye it appeared to be diamond shape.  I took a video of it with my phone and in the video it appears circular. At one point after I stopped taping I did see and airplane with its navigation lights flashing fly almost in straight line of sight with object.;45.6634;-118.7791
