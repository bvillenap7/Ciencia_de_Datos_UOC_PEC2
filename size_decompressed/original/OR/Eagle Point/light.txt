My friend was there to hear my reaction but wasn’t able to see it himself because he was on his phone. I wouldn’t consider my self crazy and I believe in logical explanations but I’m failing to see the logic in this. The visual reminded me of a video I once saw of a tracer fire light but appearing to have come from the sky. I suppose there was a little bit of a light trail but not like one you would see from a shooting star. Was definitely not a shooting star.;42.4953;-122.8052
