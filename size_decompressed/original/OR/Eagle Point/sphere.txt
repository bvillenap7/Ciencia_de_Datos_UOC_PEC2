Disappeard and reappeared in nonsequential order.;2001-07-23 14:30:00;5 Minutes;Disappeard and reappeared in nonsequential order. I was on my way home with my mother when she pointed out an airplane. I commented on how it was strange to see airplane lights in the middle of the day. All of a sudden it dissappeared. We sat there looking for it. all of a sudden it reappeared much farther than any airplane can travel in that time period. It kept dissappearing and reappearing for five minutes. It finally dissapeared for a final time and we were on our way. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));42.4953;-122.8052
