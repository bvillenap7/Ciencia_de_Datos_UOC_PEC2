Traveling east on hwy 140 just outside of Eagle Point, three men, ages 23, 35 and 62 (whome is retired air force and currently still flys civilian small aircraft) all witnessed a large bright metallic oval traveling south to north at an incredible speed.   The object then zig zagged up at 45 degree angles, hovered for roughly 1 full minute, before disappearing like someone turned off a light switch.;42.4953;-122.8052
