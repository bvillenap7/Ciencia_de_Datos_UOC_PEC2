I was out running thinking about how much I hate Chemtrails, when I notice what I first thought was a airplane.  Then after looking closer realized there were five craft flying in formation.  2 in front flying parallel to each other perfectly.  Then 3 in the back which were changing formation but occasionally taking a v-shape formation, also constantly changing their formation at one time they were even all lined up straight but flying so close that I think it would be considered exstreamly dangerous.   I saw them fly for about a whole minute they were very light and coloration almost White.   They flew east to west. They flew lower that the clouds.  The 2 in front did not change formation  the whole time.  The strangest part about the whole experience were the three crafts in such close proximity to each other changing formation I just don't know of any craft that could do that.;42.4953;-122.8052
