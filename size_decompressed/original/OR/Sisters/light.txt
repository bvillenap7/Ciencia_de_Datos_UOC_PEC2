2 identical objects seen at high altitude.;2001-08-17 22:00:00;2 minutes;2 identical objects seen at high altitude. Me and my friend while camping observed what at first apperaed to be a satelite. I traveld in a straight North to South direction and at the approximate speed that a satelite would appear to be traveling. Moments after spotting this the inteity of the light increased 20 fold. The object faded from view a few seconds later. This was fallowed by an identical object that did the exact thing. The second object trailed by perhpas 30 seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  Ignoring the events that reportedly had occurred over Wyoming and Colorado just minutes before this sighting, we believe this report describes an event that is indistinguishable from the flare of an Iridium satellite.  We will check to see if an Iridium could have been visible at this time.  PD));44.3156;-121.5175
Very unusual, 11 bright non-blinking objects observed east of Sister, OR, trailing one another.  ((Starlink satellites));2020-04-16 21:10:00;3 minutes;Very unusual, 11 bright non-blinking objects observed east of Sister, OR, trailing one another from southwest to northeast at 9:10 pm. Very unusual, 11 bright non-blinking objects similar to usual satellites were observed trailing one another from southwest to northeast at 9:10 p.m. just east of Sisters, Oregon. Was sitting in my hot tub observing the night sky as I usually do. All objects passed by within 3 minutes, some closer to one another, others more separated, and two pairs side by side. Atypical trajectory, as most satellites here pass south to north or visa versa. In the past I have seen two such objects and then rushed inside to get online and discover that the space station and the trailing Space Shuttle had just passed over, but this was something else!;44.3156;-121.5175
