Around 10:36pm (22:36). my son spotted the very long, illuminated  craft (Um guys, WHAT IS THAT!?), in the northern sky, heading west to east.  From our location, it was maybe 30 degrees up from the horizon.  We left the campfire and quickly got our phones out to record it the pics are poor unfortunately.  It was moving slowly, and wasn't bright.  Knowing that it wasn't an airplane, I flashed it a few times with a green laser, just in case it might react.  It did not.  I believe the craft was moving at a very high altitude.  It reminded me of the SpaceX rocket re-entry, but wasn't breaking apart.  I'm very familiar with stargazing, and we had just watched the ISS fly by (which had a -4.0 brightness = very bright!) and we had also watched starlink satellites fly over as well.  It was very exciting!;44.3156;-121.5175
