3 bright pulsating lights growing brighter along mountainside;2020-07-22 03:00:00;2 minutes;3 bright pulsating lights growing brighter along mountainside 3 large pulsating lights on side of cliff/mountain, which began spreading out and growing brighter. Lights were very unusual and Iâ€™ve never seen anything like this in that specific spot. Seemed to be emitting light from the bottom of something as the lights were not facing forward, but down beneath the objects. Too far away to see shapes of objects. Could not stay and observe because a truck driving 85mph or so barreled towards us and forced us to drive away;45.2972;-121.739
