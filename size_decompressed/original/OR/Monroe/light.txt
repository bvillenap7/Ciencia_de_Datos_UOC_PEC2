I was outside of my house crying due to a argument with my boyfriend.  I thought maybe I could wish upon a star to make things better and when I looked up to the sky I saw a large, yellow/orange glowing orb of light.  It hovered above the treeline for only maybe 4 seconds and then it seemed to beam behind the treeline.  Of all my years I have seen nothing like this ever.  I told one of my close friends of the occurrence and she too said she had seen a similar sighting the night before.  I am not saying I believe in extraterrestrials, but it is definitely I'm not saying isn't possible now.;44.3208;-123.3229
