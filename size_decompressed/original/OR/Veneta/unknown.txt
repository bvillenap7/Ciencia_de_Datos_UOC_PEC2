Orange flickering orb of light flying low and slow in Oregon;2010-08-30 23:00:00;3-4 mins;Orange flickering orb of light flying low and slow in Oregon I was walking back from a nearby convenience store at right around 11:00pm on August 30, 2010.  The moon was about three quarters full but close to the eastern horizon so the stars were very clear.  Veneta is very small town so there is not much in the way of lights to block out the sky so I was checking it out as I walked. To the south I saw an orange slightly flickering light moving north toward my position very slowly.  The object was moving parallel to Territorial Highway and just barely east of it.  The color seemed strange but I assumed whatever it was would become more easily identifiable, once it got closer, in the form of clearly blinking lights or lights other than the flickering orange.  This however was not the case.  Its appearance did not change in any way.  I could not make out any definite shape or see anything other than just an orange slightly flickering light.  Judging by my perception of its altitude it was not a very large object. I remained in place in the parking lot of the Veneta public library watching as it moved at a speed of about 15 mph or less at an altitude of approximately 150 to 200 feet.  I could hear no sound coming from its direction.  When it had reached my position it slowed to a stop.  It was now just east of me as I stood in the library parking lot along Territorial Hway.  The object or orb remained stationary for about 45 seconds then began to move east and directly away from my position.  At first I wasn't sure if it was actually moving or just getting smaller.  I kept watching as it became clear that it was moving east and slowly gaining altitude. After about a minute I could no longer see it. Itâ€™s direction of movement would have taken it over Eugene, OR, which is much bigger so there is the possibility that it was seen there.;44.0407;-123.3553
