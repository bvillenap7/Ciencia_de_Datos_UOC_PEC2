The object was traveling too fast for known aircraft, yet too slowly for a meteorite. It had a bluish hue around the object. I fully expected the object to crash land past the ridge near my residence.  I did not hear any sound emitting from the object, nor did I hear the sound of an impact.;43.0744;-124.1207
