It is a remote area with no houses or lights. I was traveling west. I saw a big bright white flash that lit up the whole area to the south then something flew by from south to north across in front of me on a 45 degree up angle. It was traveling  at about a 15 degree downward angle. It was shaped like a missile with a cockpit and the whole thing was shimmering a blue green color. I was in a canyon that was fairly steep. It was very dark. It all happened within about five seconds or less. I had no way of judging size or distance or speed. Later I thought that it may have been a transformer blowing and shooting a charge of electricity through an overhead power line. I called the power company and they had no record of trouble out that way. Neither did the Sheriffs office.;43.0744;-124.1207
