Blinking light near Lyra that doesn't move.;2019-08-30 21:30:00;15 minutes;Blinking light near Lyra that doesn't move. Around 9:30 p.m., my wife had stepped out for some fresh air,  she came back in a couple minutes later and said she saw what she thought was a small shooting star or a beam of light.  She went back outside and a few minutes later I followed.   She says there is a blinking light up there.  I look directly overhead and see between the constellations Lyra and Cygnus (closer to Lyra) what appears to be about a 3.5 magnitude star completely blinking on and off.  The light was blueish-white in color with possible hints of orange and thru binoculars is just a pinpoint of light not moving in relation to the numerous background stars and is clearly blinking 'on and off'.   After about 10-15 minutes of watching, it faded out but never appeared to move at least not any perceivable amount.  Never saw any more beams of light or other anomalies.;43.0744;-124.1207
