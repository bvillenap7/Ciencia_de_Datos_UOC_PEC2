Bottom edge has a blue glow,  right and left middle small amounts of red.  Changes slightly in intensity,  but does not blink. The bottom edge had a more intense light. Object appears to be west southwest of Molalla Oregon and I would guess somewhere west southwest of Woodburn,  but distances are impossible to tell. A southbound commercial aircraft passed high above it....leading me to believe it was no more than 1000 feet above ground. Now 25 minutes into the sighting,  it has slowly moved west southwest, and seems to be lower, although this appearance may be a factor of increasing distance.  Intensity is less.
