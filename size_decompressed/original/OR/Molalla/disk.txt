Object was seen decending into a valley. Neighbor friend was informed several minutes after the sighting by his friend who witnessed the object. Wind was blowing to from the SW 15-25 Kts, gusts to 30 on the hill. It was not raining at the time of the observation. Cloud bases approx. 2000 overcast. Approach corridor into PDX about 10-15 miles west of area. I will try to get more details this evening.;45.1223;-122.5756

It was approx 2500-3500 ft above. I slowed my car down to get a better look, it stayed there for approx 7 seconds.  I looked away, to make sure I wasn't going to hit anyone with my car. I looked back at the craft, it was speeding away (towards the east) at an excessive speed-I barely got a last glimpse of it!;45.1223;-122.5756

I was looking almost directly up trying to track the sound of a very highe light plane.  I saw a disk like light greyish/white object hovering.  The object was somewhat hazy or fuzzy appearing because of the altitude and the vapor and smke haze in the sky.  As I was watching this object trying to rationalize why it was their the jump plane apperd from my right side entering my circle of vision traveling North to South.  I passed beneeth the disc and the tail of the light aircraft obscured the disk momentarilly.  The disc continued to hover for another secondor two, the jumpers were exiting when the disc accelerated from the position obove me towards the NE.  From Molalla towards the Mount Hood area, approximately 140degrees of sky, in about 3seconds.  Some rudimentary calcs placed the disc above 45000 feet. I am a retired Air Force Officer, with 20000 flight hours, I hold a Ph.D. in Physics and I carry a current flight rating and physical. Correction as to the arc of travel of the sighting.  Using a Spi-TRONIC Pro360 Digital track device.  The object traveled from - 11 degrees of vertical to + 82.9 degrees of vertical, and arc of 93.9 degrees in just under 3 seconds.
