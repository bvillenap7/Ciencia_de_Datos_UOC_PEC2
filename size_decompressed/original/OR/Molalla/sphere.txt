Orange orb seen in Molalla OR on 01/15/2012.  Lasted 45 seconds.;2012-01-15 22:18:00;45 seconds;Orange orb seen in Molalla OR on 01/15/2012.  Lasted 45 seconds. At 22:18 on 01/15/2012 my family and I were travelling home from having dinner at my parents.  As we approached our home we noticed a bright orange orb moving from the southeast to the northwest.  We first thought it was a fireball.  I pulled the car over and we continued to observe its movement.  We agreed that it wasnâ€™t a fireball as it did not have a tail and it seemed to be turning towards the north.  My wife then suggested it might be a commercial airplane on fire.  I opened the door and exited the car and could not hear any sounds from the object as it was now getting farther away and accelerating as a commercial airplane now approached from the south.  In a matter of a few seconds it accelerated up and away very quickly and out of sight.  The glow of the object made it appear to be very large and even though it came somewhat close, I could not determine a definite body to the object.  The color was orange and there were no flashing lights or other lig! hts of any color.  The weather was mostly clear with a few clouds out.   Temp was 32 degrees.  I have never witnessed anything as strange as this.;45.1223;-122.5756
A lone F-15 attempting to intercept an unknown aircraft.;2020-04-05 20:45:00;2-3 minutes;A lone F-15 attempting to intercept an unknown aircraft. At 20:45 on April 6th, 2020, my father and I saw what looked like a star in the Western sky.  It then became apparent that it wasn't a star or a satellite.  It was omitting a glowing, steady, white light.  What made us pay more attention was the fact that it was flying fast at a low elevation.  It was traveling from Northwest to Southeast.  We then heard the sound of an F-15, which is a common occurrence around where we live.  It's a common trail that the Oregon Air National Guard flies their F-15s.  It appeared as if the F-15 was attempting to intercept the craft.  The craft did not change its speed, and headed South/ Southeast.  The F-15 seemingly paced the craft until out of sight, below the horizon.  The whole event lasted maybe two to three minutes.  We didn't see either the F-15 or the craft again.  My dad knew the sound of the F-15 and that is what alerted us to look for it.  What was also odd was the fact that the F-15 was flying alone, because we almost always s! ee them flying in pairs.;45.1223;-122.5756
