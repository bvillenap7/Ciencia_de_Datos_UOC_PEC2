i could tell you this: IT WAS NOT AN AIRPLANE!;2003-06-15 00:17:00;10-15 min;i could tell you this: IT WAS NOT AN AIRPLANE! me and my friend were outside playing basketball in front of her house and i was looking at the stars and noticed 2 bright lights blinking at a very rapid speed. it was moving extremly fast through the sky. one minute it was in one spot and the next it was on the other side of the sky. we watched it for about 4-5 minutes as it zigzagged left and right and also up and down. it also kept dissapearing. we noticed it dropped something small and red. then it kept trailing off into the sky and then it finally dissapeared.after we had been watching it for about 6-7 mnutes we went in and got her mom. she also thought that it was odd. for a minute i thought it was an airplane, but it was moving way to fast and it was way to coordinated. it seemed to have a pattern: left, up, dropped down fast, then it went up really fast, then it went right, then all of a sudden it went left then dissapeared. What we both thought was very odd was how the object sailed all the way across the sky in about 30-45 seconds and than dissapeared and ended up turning around while repeating the pattern 5 or 6 times. then all of a sudden it came really close to the ground and paused for a couple of seconds. when it came down close enough to see, it for a minute looked like a plane  but then i noticed running lights: red and orange. COULD YOU PLEASE TELL ME WHAT THE HELL THIS THING WAS!!!!!! i know i'm not going phsyco, so please figure this out. me and my friend were really freaked out by this.
