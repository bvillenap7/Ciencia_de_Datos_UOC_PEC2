At first I thought they were stars but I looked around and there was zero stars in the sky.  And they were in a perfect triangle.  When the clouds passed in front of the lights the lights moved together very slowly out of the way.  I woke up my son and he saw them as well.  Then in a second they took off very fast almost looking like they went straight up.  The most unusual thing was they kept moving out from behind the clouds.  Very interesting;43.907;-123.0273
