Bright white sphere Creswell, OR.;2012-09-29 21:45:00;1 second;Bright white sphere Creswell, OR. For the past couple of days, I have been doing research on ufo sightings and abductions. I have never witnessed anything personally, but all the reports of sightings everywhere has had me intrigued. My husband, my two daughters and I went to Springfield today, and on our trip in, I was telling them what interesting things I had learned in my recent research.  Again, on our way home our conversation again led to the topic of my research. Jokingly, my daughter pointed out the window of our truck, and said she had spotted a ufo. I made a joke also, and then we agreed that we wouldn’t make any more jokes, and that if we really ever see one, we would be able to know if the other was truthful or not? No sooner had we said that,  a very bright white sphere appeared on the north side.  Not in the sky, but next to us, about 100 feet away. It was gone almost as soon as it had appeared.  My husband yelled out “What the hell was that?”   None of us had an answer. We were st! unned. We certainly had not expected to see anything at all, and certainly not so close or low! We agreed that we had all seen the same thing, but had no explanation of what it could have been other than what we had been talking about. It looked to be about the size of a basketball from our view. It also appeared to leave a trail, like it was moving very fast.  What we saw, was not like what I have been reading about. The experience was very eerie.  This event happened while traveling west on Lynx Hollow Road, about 3 miles up Lynx Hollow Road, which is about 7 miles south of the town of Creswell.  It happened at approximately 9:45 pm. It was dark outside, and the area is very much a country setting.;43.907;-123.0273
