I WAS DRIVING AT 65 MILES AN HOUR. IT TOOK ME BY SURPRISE AND THE FIVE OR SO SECONDS IT TOOK TO REGISTER IN MY MIND IT WAS VERY CLEAR AND AND THE SKY WAS AZURE IN APPEARANCE. THE OBJECT WAS VERY EASY TO SEE. I STOPPED THE VEHICLE ON I-5 AND FISHED OUT MY BINOCS TO GET A BETTER LOOK. IT WAS STILL IN THE SKY! I GOT OUT OF THE VEHICLE, FOCUSED THE LENS AND IT WAS STILL PRESENT TO OBSERVE! AS I WAS LOOKING AT IT I SAW IT DISINCRATE. THIS TOOK ABOUT THREE TO FOUR SECONDS. IT WAS NO LONGER THERE TO OBSERVE.

Light blue colored light moves  and zig zags in the sky then disapears in  Creswell Oregon.;2009-10-14 22:00:00;45 seconds;Light blue colored light moves  and zig zags in the sky then disapears in  Creswell Oregon. 10/14/09, 10:00 PM I went outside to let the dog out when I caught a bright light blue colored light in the eastern sky.  It was motionless for about 30 seconds, then shot through the sky twords the west at a high rate of speed.  The light traveled across the sky and then stopped just as suddenly.  The object remained still for about 5 seconds before making a zig zag pattern then disapearing into thin air.  After checking this site for any other related sightings in the area, found that the exact same discription of what I saw was reported 10/14/02.  Whats the odds on the seeing the exact same thing on the exact same day 7 years apart.  People thimk Im crazy, but I know what I saw.;43.907;-123.0273
