It happened just as a fireworks event was about to kick off at the Creswell High School.  My wife and I were in the back of my pickup facing east on Nieblock Lane, when I noticed a bright red-orange object, drifting silently towards the south.  It moved extremely slowly towards the south, then turned away towards the east and eventually disappeared.   It was just a large round bright object, not a Chinese lantern, not a firework, not a drone, not a flare, not a helicopter, not a plane, not a balloon, and I’m not crazy.   From the distance it was at, it was too big to be a simple Chinese lantern.  And it never drifted up, it just appeared out of nowhere and flew along a level altitude, not gaining or losing altitude for the entire 2-3 minutes we all watched it.   I spent several years in the Army as a Combat Medic and I’ve seen all sorts of aircraft, weaponry, flares and such to know that what my wife and I saw, along with another couple nearby, was by definition an unidentified flying object.  The object we all saw can be found at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pH3UIrN7sTQ;43.907;-123.0273
