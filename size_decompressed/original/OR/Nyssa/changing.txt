Strobe type objects that vary in shape.;2002-08-31 23:00:00;90 minutes taped;Strobe type objects that vary in shape. I have recorded strobe type lights during the night as seen.  The lights change colors red, blue,green, yellow and white.  The lights pulse then disappear.  My camcorder shows a craft that changes shapes.  I have watched these lights for many nights.  They are in the east, south, northeast and southeast from where we live.  Some nights, the lights in the southeast have numbered three in a row and one on either side. The sizes I have seen vary.  One night, Sept. 7, I saw a solid looking one that changed from a lemon looking thing to separate, then separate again, three in all.  All of these craft were different sizes of the same craft. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that twinkling stars are one possible explanation for the sighting.  PD));43.8589;-117.0208
