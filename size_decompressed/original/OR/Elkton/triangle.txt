Two triangluar-shaped craft filmed near Elkton, OR;2009-09-09 20:45:00;5 minutes;Two triangluar-shaped craft filmed near Elkton, OR I filmed two objects.  One of them was visibly a solid, triangular-shaped object.  There were three white lights on the back, a light on the front tip of the triangle, red and green flashers on each back corner, as well as a VERY bright white strobe on the bottom.  They moved slowly from south to north at an approximate altitude of 10,000 feet or less.  A vague engine noise was heard only when objects were directly overhead. A complete description of events, including the full video and still photo enhancements, is available on my blog at http://www.oregonbigfoot.com/blog/bigfoot/i-think-i-may-have-filmed-a-ufo-last-night-or-two/  (Note: One of my blog readers in Southern Oregon apparently saw similar objects just before I did. His comments are posted to the blog. I prefer to maintain the images and video on my blog only and do not wish to have them published elsewhere. You are welcome to refer visitors to the blog to view the stills and video.);43.64;-123.5905
