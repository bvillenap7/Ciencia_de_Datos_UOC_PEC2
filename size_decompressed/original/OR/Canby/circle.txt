Glowing, pulsing orb seen on a rural road in early evening.  Alternated colors.

Rose into the air and flew away, leaving a trail. I was driving home on a rural road in the early evening and noticed a glowing orb floating roughly 150 feet in the air.  When I drove nearer, my radio cut out. It was hard to tell the exact size of the object, but I would say it was between 30 and 50 feet in diameter.  It alternated between orange, yellow, and white. It appeared to be pulsing. I pulled over and continued to watch.  As I did so, it began moving lazily from side-to-side. Then, it rose slowly higher into the air until it was about 300 feet above the ground.  It flew away and disappeared beyond the treeline, leaving a short, hazy trail behind it.   The entire incident took place in roughly a minute and a half.  I did not see it anymore after that.;45.2525;-122.6824
Large white ball of light moving silently over Clackamas County, OR.;2017-03-29 19:00:00;5 minutes;Large white ball of light moving silently over Clackamas County, OR. I live in the outskirts of town in the country.   Last night, while taking out the garbage at around 9 pm, I was looking at the constellation Triangulum, when I noticed a bright white light right above me (my zenith).  It proceeded to move across the sky silently.  But was larger than a planet or plane.  No blinking lights.  I filmed it on my cell phone.   As I was filming it a plane comes into view so you can clearly see what a plane looks like and then there is this giant white ball of light just slowly moving across the night sky.  It was larger than the plane when the plane finally flew in front of it, blocking out the light for a split second.   Before the large object was noticed above me, I saw several little tiny balls of light (think similar to a satellites) moving in different directions, all coming from the constellation of Triangulum.  The white ball of light only started moving, once I noticed it above me.  This is not the first sighting I have had, but the first! one that I have been able to film.  I am unable to upload the video as the file size is too large.;45.2525;-122.6824
