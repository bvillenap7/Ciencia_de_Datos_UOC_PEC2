Day was cloudy but dry. I saw an extremly bright light drop out of the clouds. The object had no shape, but the light was extremly brite. The object flew from from the southwest to the northeast and moved at a fairly nornal speed. The object flew below the clouds for approx 5 seconds, when two aircraft came out of the clouds and took up a position about 1 mile behind the light. They flew along for about 3 seconds when what appeared to be a missle came off the wing of one of the aircraft and came toward the light. The missle covered about half the distance betwen the light and the aircraft, when the light picked up speed and flew back into the clouds. The missle followed the light into the clouds, the aircraft split up, one went right, one left and both flew back into the clouds and out of sight.;45.2525;-122.6824

2 amber lights over field outside of Canby, Oregon.;2016-09-15 22:05:00;2-3 minutes;2 amber lights over field outside of Canby, Oregon. 9-15-16   On the evening of September 15th, 2016, at around 10:05 P.M., I was driving east on Arndt Rd. towards Canby, Oregon, through a stretch of open farmland, where I noticed two glowing yellowish amber colored balls of light hovering over a field to the right hand side of the  road. Both of them where close to one another with no flashing lights as a normal aircraft would have and they were mostly stationary.  I could not make out a specific object just the round balls of glowing light.  Each of them where larger and much closer than stars yet not nearly as large as the moon and very low on the horizon just over the field in the distance.  They appeared to be moving slightly from side to side to side irregularly not in sync with one another. I observed the balls of light as I drove past the field for approximately two minutes and proceeded on to Canby.  The sky was mostly clear with few clouds. About myself.  	Iâ€™m a male, 23 years old, single.  I spend a decent amount of time outdoors, fishing and camping.  I worked as a flagger and during grounds keeping and landscape maintenance.  I have never seen anything like this before.;45.2525;-122.6824
