His has disappeared, but mine is still obvious, although the skin is peeling. In the middle of July, 1998, I noticed a small circular mark on my husband's right shoulder. He had no idea what it was or where it came from. I joked that it must've been the aliens! He said it didn't itch, burn, or hurt, and it went away in about a week. On August 10, 1998, I awoke with a mark exactly like his on my left breast. I remember waking up after feeling a pinch at 2 a.m. I was not wearing anything that could make such a perfect mark, nor was there anything in our bed that could've made it. Before we had gone to bed that night, I joked to my husband that we should be on the lookout for aliens! I still have the mark (doesn't itch, spread, burn or hurt) but it is now peeling like a sunburn. I have had many encounters in my life, but this is one that I have no remembrance of!;45.2525;-122.6824
