Triangular formation, pinpoints of white light, sighted in the western sky.;1999-09-27 19:57:00;3 minutes;Triangular formation, pinpoints of white light, sighted in the western sky. I was outside my home, looking at the stars emerging from twilight, when as I focussed on the evening star to the west at about twenty degrees above the horizon, I noticed movement from just below it.  I was able to make out three pinpoints of light in a triangle formation about the size of a quarter held at arm's length. This formation seemed to be dimming out at times, as though covered by a fuzzy darkness that would occlude up to two of the lights in the triangle.  I followed the object with my eyes while it moved left, then diagonally upward to the right, then left again, continueing toward Orion's belt, where I stopped watching to go and get my roommate, when we returned to the front yard, I could no longer spot the object(s). This observation took about 2 1/2 to 3 minutes, beginning at about 7:55 pm PDT, 09/27/99.;45.2525;-122.6824
Fleet of 39+ Flying White Dot's.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-12 05:00:00;05:57;Fleet of 39+ Flying White Dot's I Woke up at 4:45 am, grabbed my coffee then went outside to smoke. I look at the stars in the sky. Tonight I saw a Fleet of Flying White Dot's traveling East. I wasn't prepared to stay out in the Morning Cold. I watched quite a few passing overhead before I thought about Counting them. I counted 39 of them before I got too Cold to stay out any longer. This is not the First time I've seen these Flying over my house in the Early AM Hour's.;45.2525;-122.6824
