A light flashes down with rainbows in a video my mom took of a bird.  After a second or two of this, next in the video a small rectangular or double cigar haled object goes across the screen in three frames.  The video captures at 16fps so the object blurs across the screen.  I made stills to capture the object as it is too difficult to see if you watch the whole video.
