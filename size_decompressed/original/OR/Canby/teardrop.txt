Stars;2011-12-13 16:00:00;Through out the nights;i was peering into the sunset and right after sun was setting and the day sky started going away i would look into the southern eastern parts of the sky right befor the sky goes dark i would see these ligths in the air and then would see them fly irratic and will see them go on some type of uniform formation every night they follow the stars but wobble horrible and this will scare people when i show them these lights in the sky and can rule out sattelitles planets ect. only explsntion is the govt., not humans of this earth.  I have seen these anomolies since the end of summer 2011 and the moon went sideways and red .  i have seen these star people on this day forward every clear night the brightest stars in the sky are what i see and the light does not interact like a star more like a craft. these events are happening to the closer of 12-21-2012;45.2525;-122.6824
