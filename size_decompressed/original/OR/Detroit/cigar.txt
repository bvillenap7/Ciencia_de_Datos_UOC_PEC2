Then from the East it flew around Forked Butte and came at us less than ten ft. off the snow covered ground.The vehicle then rapidly (popped) approached us from the East and landed ten ft. in front of us, turned out its bright white light and turned on an interior light revealing the semi-transparent red, green & blue lens. The vehicle then exited rapidly and climbed into space and disappeared behinfd Mt. Jefferson. The vehicle emitted sparks from the stern much like a 1930's Buck Rogers space vehicle. On Sunday evening at approx. 10 pm Dec. 22, 1981 myself, my 11 yr. old son and another person were buzzed by over 12 of these same vehicles. We witnessed them flying up to a larger cigar shaped vehicle and started orbiting around it. The whole system then rose up into the night sky and disappeared. I interviwed Police catain Ellidge ! and Lt. Horton who recieved over a thousand phone calls concerning individuals from Eugene in February 1982. I reported the incident to the FBI. Since then we have studyed in depth the technology we were shown and hence got a U.S. patent ont the technology in 1989. We intend to build and test prototypes soon. Please visit our website to review this technology at http://www.unitelnw.com. The Medford incident may be the same vehicles. I believe they are our own vehicles that we are about to build attempting to return to the correct spacetime departure point. Thank you, Sincerely,;44.735;-122.145
