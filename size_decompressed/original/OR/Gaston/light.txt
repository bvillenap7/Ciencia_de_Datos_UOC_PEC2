I don’t remember the date exactly.  I think it was November 18, 2004 but could have been a day or two early that week.  It was around 10 p.m. PST in Gaston, Oregon. We were sitting on her bed looking out her window to the East hills when just above the hills we saw 3 lights.  They seemed hover for a bit in a triangular form but then they started moving randomly.  One dropped vertically quickly then moved to the South on the horizontal like a right angle.  This really surprised me.  I have never seen anything move this smoothly or quickly. The lights changed colors as well.  We saw them become red, blue, green and whitish/yellow. I must say my behavior changed dramatically for a couple days following the event.  I don’t know if this has anything to do with what we saw or not but thought I would note it.;45.4438;-123.1622
