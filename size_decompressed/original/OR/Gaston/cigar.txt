Bright light, cigar shape.;2015-01-30 07:00:00;15 minutes;Bright light, cigar shape I noticed a very large light in the S.W. sky.  It did not move the whole time I was watching it.   The light had no color and changed from very bright, to dull, and bright again.   I took a picture of it and when you zoom in on it.  You can see a cigar shape.   The fog came in and covered it up.;45.4438;-123.1622
Bright light in the morning.;2015-01-30 07:00:00;15 minutes;Bright light in the morning. When I saw this, it was in the morning.  Very bright light that would go dim and bright again.   I took a picture of it and after I went in side the house I looked at the photo and saw it was cigar shaped.   I first stated it was in the S.W. but it was really in the N. W. 	 I hope this helps.;45.4438;-123.1622
