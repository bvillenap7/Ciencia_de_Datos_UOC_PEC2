Glowing orange orb in sky;2010-07-07 23:00:00;2-3 minutes;Glowing orange orb in sky My family and I walked outside to say goodbye to my dad.  As we were saying goodbye we looked over to our orchards.  There was a orange orb in the sky we watched it for about two minutes as it was coming near us.  Our first instincts was it was a plane without it's flashers on but as it came closer we heard no sound and the object was far to big to be a plane.   As it came over our heads and passed it shot off into the distance (approx) 15 seconds and it glowed red and dissapeared.  There was no sound and it was a orb the sky.  There was no way it could be a fire work or a plane, to low to be a sattilte.   I have never seen anything move so fast.;45.4438;-123.1622
