Bright white light, round in shape.  In space, but too large to be satellite.  Moving from both west to east and north to south. usually in pairs.  moving very fast at times and completely stopping at times.  they were mostly flying in a straight line, but they would do 90 degree turn's or shoot straight up at times too.   at one point my son shown a flashlight at one it seemed to come back toward us and shown a dim white beam of light down quite away's away from us. we told him not to do that anymore and we just spent the night watching the show untell we were asleep.   the next night we witnessed close to the same activity.;42.8771;-124.0748
