Red ember-like object on barn roof.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor.  PD));2007-08-31 22:30:00;5 seconds;Red ember-like object on barn roof. 9/1/2007  Last night I was driving up my driveway toward my barn which just got a new metal roof installed. As I was driving up about 5 mph, I saw a red ember like item with a trailing red tale rise up from my roof and then extinguish about 10’ above the barn. I thought this is impossible: a fire?  I checked around and couldn’t find anything wrong. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor.  PD));45.2856;-123.8391
