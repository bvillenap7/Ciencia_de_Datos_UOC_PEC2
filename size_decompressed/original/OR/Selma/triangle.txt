Sighting over Selma Oregon;1996-01-13 21:00:00;5 MINUTES;Sighting over Selma Oregon The weather was bad. I went outside to check the level of the creek that ran right next to our deck.  It was a very dark night with the stars very visible.  I looked up and I saw a very large triangle shaped moving black void in the sky heading south east along hwy 199. I called my wife out and she saw it also. I was about a mile north of the Selma post office along 199. The object made no noise but just moved kind of slowly, almost hovering to the southeast.  Haven't a clue as to what this was, unless it was a stealth bomber or something.  It had three points of light. one at the tip, and two to the sides and rear.  This is how I could tell its shape.;42.2665;-123.5549
