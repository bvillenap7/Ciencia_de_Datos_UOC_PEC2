My cousin and I were out side looking at the stars and he saw a red circle object in the sky.  We watched it for about two minutes and then we finally went to get our family, they came out side and looked at it for about three more minutes.  After we all had looked at it there of our family members went inside which left my aunt cousin and me out side.  All of a sudden, I looked at it and it diaper slowly.  I said, And it's gone.  My aunt never saw it disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));44.3041;-120.8364
I can't explain well.;2015-09-26 06:00:00;10 seconds;I can't explain well. The UFO I saw was not the normal circle type, it was a bit more flat with a skinny dome on top.  The sight was about 10 to 15 sec. long, and it glowed red-ish orange.  It wasn't alone (a small craft entered it).   The image I have in my mind is still freshly imprinted, but I know we're not alone and I know something weirder than usual will happen but when would be my question.
