I was in the high school parking lot heading out to my car when something caught my eye towards the rimrock.  It was a light that was moving very fast, I could tell that it wasn't on the ground because of how fast it was moving.  At first it was a bright white light but after about five seconds it dipped off the rimrock and turned a pale green color. As it hovered off of the rimrock I could tell that it was a sphere shape.  After that it was gone in an instant. It made no noise and I was alone, I was quite afraid of what I'd seen.;44.3041;-120.8364
UFO or Basket Ball in the middle of nothing?;2007-08-26 18:00:00;7 seconds;UFO or Basket Ball in the middle of nothing? Sunday 8-26-07 I was driving from Prineville Oregon towards Madras Oregon on Hwy 26 west bound and I saw a round object about 100 yards away on the right of the road.  It was falling from the sky slowly in a very straight vertical line. It was windy out but that made no difference in moving this object.  From about 100 yards away it looked about the size of a basket ball. It fell into the canyon. Anyone ever see something like this?;44.3041;-120.8364
