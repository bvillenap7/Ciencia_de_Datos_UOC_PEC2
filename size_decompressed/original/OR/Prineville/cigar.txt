Bright red glowing object in Prineville, Or.;2011-10-09 18:00:00;1 min;Bright red glowing object in Prineville, Or. I saw a cigar shaped (squared off, like a square rectangle) glowing extremely bright red come up and over a ridge in Prineville, Or.   It hovered for a second or two then slowly looked like it fell to the ground. Never losing it's brightness or shape. I am talking like 45 minutes away from me.   I told my husband what I saw, he kind of looked like I was crazyâ€¦.   And there it came again, this time it came from the ground up, hovered for a couple of seconds then went back down to the ground.;44.3041;-120.8364
