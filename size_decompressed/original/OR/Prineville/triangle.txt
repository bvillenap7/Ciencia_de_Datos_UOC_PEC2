I pointed out what I believed to just be a slow moving plane.  ((anonymous report));2018-04-25 21:35:00;3 minutes;Was looking at the stars since it's finally warm enough and clear skies, I started showing my girlfriend what constellations where visable and light differences in stars as well as planets when I pointed out what I believed to just be a slow moving plane.  (first seeing it come from where Orion is tonight to the right of the grade view point where the data center is.)  It was heading south east about so its trajectory put it coming overhead then past in a slow pace.  As it came closer it had different lights than any planes I've seen.  Two white lights and a flashing light in the middle at first, but as it got closer to the moons light and to me crossing above 3 white lights were visable as well as the shape of a triangle.  Very sleek and black not perfect lined triangle but exotic angles making a low hum like a distant airliner noise slightly different and no visable propulsion or engine.  Continued off in the same direction out of sight.  Also was quite big! for how close it was from the ground.;44.3041;-120.8364
