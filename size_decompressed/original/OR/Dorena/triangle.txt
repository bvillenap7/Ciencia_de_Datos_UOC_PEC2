Forth of July holiday, my brother had a party at his house. Was actually pretty mellow. Kids were all in the house,asleep or watching a movie. About 7 of us adults were sitting in lawnchairs in the back yard, enjoying the quiet.Midnight or a few minutes after, not music or outside lights. A warm night and the stars were VERY bright. I was scooted down in my chair, so I could rest my head back so I could observe the sky. (I have had anouther experience in Drain a few years ago, so I always keep my eyes peeled for further activity. At one point I was staring at the area directly overhead, when a few of the stars started to move! In a triangle formation- one white light that was just like a star at all 3 corners. Inside of the 'triangle' was very dark. I got everyone's attention and said, Did I drink more than I thought? Or are those stars moving? Everyone pretty much freaked out and said yes, they were moving! I was facing toward the north. They moved as one and kept the same formation- moved from overhead at an arch toward the east. Than one by one they just vanished. When it pass over a star, it would not show in the middle.Made no sound, at all. If I hold my hand up, the 'triangle'would of at least been as big as my palm. (Sorry, can't think of better way to tell howbig/far away it was.) ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  May have been a formation of U. S. Navy NOSS satellites.  PD));43.7361;-122.8946
