My wife and I were out on our front deck and noticed a bright light in the sky towards the west.  It was too early for any stars to been seen and at first it didn't look like it was moving.  As we watched, we noticed it moved slightly to the west. I used a branch on one of the 80' Fir trees to fix a location because it stopped moving again.  It stayed still for several minutes and then started to move very slowly to the west and then it was gone. I look into the sky a lot because we have a beautiful view seeing eagles, osprey, Clackamas river but have never seen anything like this before.  I would guess the altitude to be very high since it looked like a bright star. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.   PD));45.3583;-122.3494
