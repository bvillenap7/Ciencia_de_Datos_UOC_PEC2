Extremely bright triangular shaped object sighted in the sky in Eagle Creek, Oregon.;2002-08-26 23:45:00;15 minutes;Extremely bright triangular shaped object sighted in the sky in Eagle Creek, Oregon. At about 11:45pm in Eagle Creek, Oregon my husband and I spotted a bright white light standing still in the sky. At first it appeared to be an airplane, but it was about 200 feet in the sky and it was not moving at all. It was triangular shaped and very bright. We rolled the windows down and pulled over to the side of the road. There were lights around the bottom of the object. We also noticed how quiet it was. There was complete silence we then dialed the police to report what we were looking at and the object suddenly took off rather quickly. When it took off it made the sound of an airplane taking off and it had several flashing lights. It was out of sight rather quickly. The police then transfered us to the UFO center.;45.3583;-122.3494
