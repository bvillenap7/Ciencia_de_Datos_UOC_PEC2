Observed 8 bright lights heading NE/E with one changing direction.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-16 22:00:00;10 minutes;Observed 8 bright lights heading NE/E with one changing direction Watching for satellites I noticed two lights flying in a fixed formation, heading NE, followed by a third in the same direction, and a few seconds later a fourth.  The fifth light that had been stationary and I had thought was a star and it began to head SE then slightly changing direction eventually disappearing.  A few minutes later I watched two more in a fixed formation heading E and the eighth heading NE a minute after that.  There was no noise associated with any of the lights and compared to satellites I have seen in the past and those last night, these lights were much brighter and moving very quickly.;45.3583;-122.3494
