Went from southwest to northeast horizon in about 6 sec. I observed a flashing light that was moving from the southwest to the northeast at a incredible high rate of speed.  Did not hear any noise what so ever, I live in a rural area where there is no background noises.   The white light was going so fast that the flashes of light appeared to stretch or become a dashed line but was not solid.  Flash seem to be consistent timing flashing every Â½ to a second or so.  Was up in the air approximately 20,000-40,000 ft, went from one end of the horizon to the other end in about 6 seconds.;45.3583;-122.3494
