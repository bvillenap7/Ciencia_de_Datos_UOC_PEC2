Ball of light seen over Prospect, Oregon;2006-09-18 18:02:00;20 Minutes;Ball of light seen over Prospect, Oregon My daughter and I saw a ball of light looking East from Prospect, we called out the other members of the family so they could see it. It was very bright white and appeared to be twinkling. It moved up through the clouds and to the South very slowly. We took lots of pictures and got 3 video clips. The kids went inside after about 15 minutes and my husband and I were still outside watching. My Husband handed me the binoculars to look at it and when we looked back up it was gone. The event lasted about 20 minutes. The first picture was taken at 6:02 pm and the last at 6:21. I took a few more pictures of the sky afterwards and a dark ball about the same size as the ball of light was in it. Not sure if it was the same thing or just an anomaly in the photo. I will send in a cd copy of all of the picture and video files to the address listed.;42.7574;-122.5065
