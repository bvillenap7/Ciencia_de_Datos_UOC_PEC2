Two flashing white lights with a stationary red light in the middle.  As I drove further it had not moved and there were three more above it. I started driving slowly so I could watch the lights.  I was coming up towards the brigde and the rock slide area and had to pay attention to the road. After I passed the rock slide area and the gorge I spotted the lights again.  I could see two more to the north and 8-10 towards the south. I found a clear area to pull over and try to take photos and video with my cell phone, but could not see anything with it.  It is a galaxy s7. I tried to call my husband to go outside and look too but later learned his phone had died and was unable to answer. I heard a noise from across the road and became spooked so I drove home. I again lost sight of the lights as I turned onto the Prospect access road. When I arrived home I brought my husband outside but we could not see anything, we could see the big dipper and to the north clearly but trees blocked our south view. It is a possibility that these may have been drones or a military exercise as there are often exercises performed up in our mountains and we have the air force base just over the mountains in Klamath Falls.;42.7574;-122.5065
