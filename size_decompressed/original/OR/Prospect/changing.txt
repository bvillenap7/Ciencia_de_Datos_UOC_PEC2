Red, white, green bright flashing lights above timber line at Prospect, Oregon;2012-02-02 21:00:00;20 minutes;Red, white, green bright flashing lights above timber line at Prospect, Oregon A object of intense bright red, white and green light all flashing at the same time white light being dominate, descended from above the timber line down into the forest NW on highway 62 at Prospect Oregon. As each light blinks the object changes shaped similar to three pieces of cottage cheese curds blinking on and off moving around each other. Ten minutes later, the object reappears in the NE within the region of Crater Lake:  similar in shape, color and intense blinking.   Yet, the object is  stationary in the sky not descending or ascending. There have been three of these objects we have noticed since November 2011.  Always in the NE area above the timber close to Buck Mountain and Crater Lake and stationary yet staggered in the night sky. Tonight, is the first time we noticed only one object slowly lowering into the timber located on Highway 62 and then reappearing in a different area, NE, in the area of Crater Lake.;42.7574;-122.5065
