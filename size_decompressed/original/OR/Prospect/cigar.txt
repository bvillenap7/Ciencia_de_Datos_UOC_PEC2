Object near jet in Prospect, Oregon.;2006-10-20 14:01:00;a few seconds;Object near jet in Prospect, Oregon. On October 20 about 2 pm looking East from Prospect, Oregon I saw a shape near a jet I was taking a picture of. I only got one picture of it and saw it for a few seconds. Not even long enough to tell my Husband or Son, who were working on our car, to Look. It just disappeared. So I told them they will have to wait see this thing I took a picture of on the computer. It was dark and like a cigar shape. I will send the photo through email and postal mail.;42.7574;-122.5065
