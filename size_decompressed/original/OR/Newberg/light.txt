Does unearthly maneuve;1997-08-31 21:00:00;approx. 5 min.;Summary : A woman and her sun witness 5 strange lights, white in the center, yellow between the center and edge, and blue. Does unearthly maneuvers, then vanishes from sight. My mom and I had just finished watching King of the Hill, when she went to the patio door to let Pixie and Desi, our cats, out. I noticed a strange group of lights, flying in direct patterns (they would go up, then stop, and go straight left or right. Their patern was like this: o ----- white 0   0   0 ----- yellow, white, yellow 0  0  0  0  0 ----- blue, yellow, white, yellow, blue 0 ----- white ,etc. I'm a Trekkie, and X-Files fan, who would do nothing to harm any alien theories. Every week or so, I wake with strange marks, and an ugly metallic feeling in my nasal area. This began approximately one month ago, and each of these mornings I have flashbacks of alien encounters.;45.3101999999999;-122.967

object over newberg oregon, 2 witnessed, white light with three red lights attached.;2008-08-08 09:00:00;2 minutes;object over newberg oregon, 2 witnessed, white light with three red lights attached. Me and my friend where driving back to our home town of Newberg on 08/08/08. I work in a town southwest of Newberg called st.paul, about eight miles away. In st. paul, I saw what at first I thought was a low flying plane over Newberg. When it stopped moving I pointed it out to my friend, at the time it dropped or lowered three smaller red lights, all attached to some sort of line that was lit as well. When it had all of its weird red ball shaped lights( three of them) lowered, it was in the line shape of a banana. Then all at once it dropped curving like a feather does when dropped. We where driving and lost sight of it behind some trees as it descended, about five seconds later we where able to see the area it was hovering at, but it was nowhere to be seen.  I’ve always believed in ufo’s but was always a bit skeptical about them. But this put the icing on the cake for me. Please, if you have anymore reports of a similar object description seen , post them.;45.3101999999999;-122.967

Object with two whitish lights and blue glow flying over Chehalem mountains;2020-04-27 20:40:00;15 minutes;Object with two whitish lights and blue glow flying over Chehalem mountains Initially saw object with two whitish/blue lights peeking in and out of clouds moving in different directions.  Object appeared to be high in atmosphere moving at high speeds and changing direction suddenly.  Object then moved slowly westward and flashed 4 times, then 7, then 5, changed direction erratically and quickly, then disappeared behind the chehalem mountains to the north.   About two minutes later the object was low to the ground and in front of the mountains about 1 mile away with a deep blue glow.  It appeared to move slowly until it disappeared behind the trees.  Object appeared to be able to turn its lights on and off at will and change direction, speed, and elevation easily.  No audible noise detected.;45.3101999999999;-122.967
Satellite shining spotlight on airliner and dissapearing.;2020-08-24 09:30:00;2 minutes;Satellite shining spotlight on airliner and dissapearing. I was watching an Airliner fly over my house when I saw what looked like a satellite in the sky(small dot like a star.) It was moving twice as fast as a satellite and faster than regular aircraft in comparison to the airliner.  When the dot came close to the airliner it turned on a spotlight that swept from downward(earth) to towards the airliner, which it radiated in the sparse clouds and turbed off.  I watched it pass over the roof and eventually the Satellite could no longer be seen.  It traveled the same consistant speed across the sky.;45.3101999999999;-122.967
there was a spherical light emitting a green laser, pointing diagonally towards the surface of the ground. from the lazer were smaller;2021-05-16 04:00:00;Aprox: 2 minutes;there was a spherical light emitting a green laser, pointing diagonally towards the surface of the ground. from the lazer were smaller orbs of white light traveling along the green laser towards the ground in tandem. The green laser then began to dissappear in quartered segments starting at the ground and ending at the sphere the sphere then began  ascending and completely disappeared as if it passed through a barrier of some sort. I then glanced at the area through my nvgs to attempt to see of there was anything not visible to the eye alone, and in the background there were several orbs of light that appeared much farther up traveling in a straight diagonal line all appearing to be equally spaced, they also appeared to pass through some sort of barrier becoming no longer visible at the exact same spot. Very strange I have never been interested in this type of extraterrestrial stuff or any of the sort,  but I have to admit! I have been consumed by curiosity. I've googled everything and have not come across anything similar to what my wife and I witnessed. P.s in the time box I put aprox 2 minutes however we did not see the event begin as it was currently happening in the sky as we walked to the car, on my way to work .;45.3101999999999;-122.967
