Myself and a friend were out talking and watching the stars when my eye caught movement from the northwest.  It had no lights at all, but as it moved it blacked out the stars  it came directly over head  you could see that it was very large but made no sound. we watched it until we lost track.  There were other aircraft in the sky you could see there lights and faintly hear their engines, but were much higher in altitude and were not on an intercept course. we live between (less then 40 miles) two regional airports, and one international airport so no aircraft would be traveling without markers at night, that low.    I couldn't tell elevation  to well but it was no where near the norm.  It traveled in a sraight line extremeley fast. It was shaped more like a delta wing than a boom-a-rang.   If this was a secret military aircraft they weren't trying to hide it and were being completely careless by flying it in such a manner!;45.3101999999999;-122.967
