Orange Orbs over Newberg, OR clouded sky;2014-12-25 19:10:00;5 minutes;Orange Orbs over Newberg, OR clouded sky I witnessed along with my husband, my sister-n-law, and my two sons 8-10 bright orange orbs moving very slowly in a SW formation.  I say formation because they seemed to move in an orderly fashion.   They were methodically spaced apart from South to North then slightly Eastern.   As the orbs moved as they approached East they disappeared.  Almost as if they were being blocked by something or entering something.   This is the third strange sighting I have noticed since living over three years in Newberg, OR.   I have always shoved them off as to my eyes playing tricks on me.  I am not a believer in aliens or any such thing.  However, this was an incredibly strange event that I cannot (or anyone else with me) can explain, so I thought it noteworthy enough to post.   Thank you.;45.3101999999999;-122.967
