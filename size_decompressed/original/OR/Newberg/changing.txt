Object flying north to south suddenly brightens and after emitting a halo burst around it, turns sharply east to quickly disappear.;2015-09-10 03:15:00;2-3 minutes;Object flying north to south suddenly brightens and after emitting a halo burst around it, turns sharply east to quickly disappear. While outside with our dog in our yard sometime around 3:10am to 3:20am early Thursday morning, September 10th, I looked up into the northeast sky seeing a light colored object. It was flying from the north to the south similar to a satellite, which at first I thought it was.  Suddenly though the object became very bright, emitted a brief burst that created a halo around it lasting for a few seconds, then within another 2 seconds it turned sharply left (east) quickly getting smaller and smaller and disappeared.  There was no sound.  That night, the sky was especially clear, with more stars visible than most often.;45.3101999999999;-122.967
