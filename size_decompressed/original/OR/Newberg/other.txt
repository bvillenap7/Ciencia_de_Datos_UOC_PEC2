It would come to sudden stops and sit for a while and then move again.  There was no pattern to the movement or speed.  First saw the (star) at Bold Peak state park on top of Chehalem Mountain, the (star) moved behind the tree's so we drove down the road until we could see it again and watched the (star) for about a half hour before comming to no conclusion on what it was and going home.  No idea how long it was there before we saw it and how long it stayed after we left. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));45.3101999999999;-122.967

We are not aware that other reports were submitted for this apparent event.  PD));45.3101999999999;-122.967

Unusual bright light seen over N.W. Oregon.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus, which is in the NW sky, currently.  PD));2012-03-18 21:55:00;1 minute;Unusual bright light seen over N.W. Oregon Unusual bright and steady light first white then red and then blue.  Object changing colors as it moved positions. But showing a very bright red and blue for periods of time.  Was first seen traveling due west and bright white.  Completely silent. Suddenly and sharply diving down in a deliberate S shape of travel in the sky.  Then traveled up about half way and traveled back east.  Object was in the N.N.W. sky over mountain.  Object disappeared for 20 seconds due to view blocked by trees.  Object reappeared for 10 more seconds and traveled in a extremely fast and deliberate circular pattern, while remaining completely silent before finally traveling east again and out of view.;45.3101999999999;-122.967

Driving home, my daughter and I witness a very strange form trying to replicate a cloud in an almost triangular shape but with a tail pointing down to earth.  The shape changed color for a florescent yellowish green to fluorescent red, then back to yellow.  It was stationary and looked like it even had the clouds stopped from moving. the tail grew, and as we reached our destination we got out of the car and watched it change to almost camouflage it's color to look like a cloud only a little darker.  the tail began to retract, the form slowly began to dissipate but not like the clouds. the wisps were nothing like the clouds around it.  I have video footage of it as it was like nothing I have ever seen before.  I did in 2000 ish see another sighting but NOTHING like this..  The colors of what it was stood out like a storm in a clear sky with a few cirrus clouds.;45.3101999999999;-122.967
