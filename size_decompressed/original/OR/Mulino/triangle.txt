Triangle of white lights heading north at high altitude over Portland.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of NOSS satellites.  PD));2003-08-31 23:30:00;1 minute;Triangle of white lights heading north at high altitude over Portland Mulino is approx. halfway between Salem and Portland, about 15 miles east of I-5, my brother in law and I standing in front of my house when he says what the hell is that. I look and we see a triangle of lights. These were single lights matching adjascent stars light output moving slowly north by northeast. Being in a heavily wooded area they were only visible for about a minute before being obscured by the trees. No sound, appeared to be very high altitude. Seen dozens of satilites but never three so close and moving in same direction. They also were blocking out local stars light when going between earth and stars so must have something solid between the points of light of the triangle. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witnesses might have observed the three satellites, which are thought to be part of the U. S. Navy NOSS satellite surveillance system.  PD));45.2131;-122.5294
