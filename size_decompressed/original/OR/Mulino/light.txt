Watching meteor shower when K mentioned he'd seen the space lab streak across the sky a week or so before. K goes Hey, there it is, pointing to a very bright light just starting to cross the horizen from west to east. As K is telling us how much different the space station is from a satelite, the light, which we expect to continue across the horizen, comes to a stop and appears to shoot straight up, disappearing. We all look at each other (3 of us) and go what was that?. The witnesses are males in their 40's, all self employed.;45.2131;-122.5294
