I called my husband out and we watched as the higher one started moving towards us.  The next one started moving after, they moved very slowly almost no sound, as they got closer and moved directly overhead, the light configuration and shape was very unusual.  Both has lots of lights, different colors, in a pattern on what looked to be the main body and had 2 smaller sections below and off to each side that had lights moving along the length of the sections.  They were extremely low still almost no sound, and were large, C-130-sized, or larger, it appeared to us.  They moved slowly overhead to the north and over our forest, we lost sight of them over our tree lines quickly because they were so low.  Saw 2 similar lighted craft hovering in the sky afterwards right after those 2.  Cell phone video photos would not work on any phone during the event, worked fine prior and after.;45.2131;-122.5294
