Solid radar return with no visual;2004-05-27 15:10:00;5 min;Solid radar return with no visual Something strange is happening with aircraft radars.  We had the radar on to navigate around some weather.  Later in the flight when we were clear of all weather, I got a strong  round 2 to 3 mile return.  But when I looked outside the aircraft there was no weather in that area. The radar beam is only 3 degrees wide and we had it set to cover the level of our flight path to slightly above. If I moved the radar beam up or down 10 degrees or so the return would decrease to zero. When I would tune back to center it was back. But only sky could be seen outside. There was no distortion in the sky. The return was not moving. Our flight path had us pass the return by 5 miles to the east.  If there is something there what kind of camera could capture an image of it?;42.2727946921444;-121.799603184713
