Light flew as wingman to commercial flight.;2000-07-25 21:57:00;5 minutes +;Light flew as wingman to commercial flight. Klamath Falls is a navagation point of a North/South Commercial Air traffic corridor. As such there is a large degree of air traffic regularly seen in this vicinity. There is a wide Military North/South military corridor begining about 45 miles to the east of here. Another N/S commercial flight path traverses Medford, Oregon to the west, approximately 55 air miles. Commercial aircraft was first noted directly over head at approximately 21:57 headed south at 180', with a bright light approximating the appearance of a satellite, with out any navigational lights, directly to the starboard side matching it's speed. If it is assumed that the commercial traffic was at 30,000 feet, than the object was approximately less than one mile from the aircraft. In lay terms, it was the distance of the width of your thumb held at arms length. It matched the flight path of the commercial until lost in the haze due to a forest fire to the south, at approximately 4 to 5 degrees in elevation, still on a 180' path, at 22:02. Magnitude of the object did not diminish, except once, for less than a second, in which it did dim. It is difficult to imagine that this was a coincidence of a polar orbit satellite appearing to match the flight path of a commercial aircraft. The other witness was called out to view the object, but she is not trained in aerial observations.;42.2727946921444;-121.799603184713
Bright blue fireball, no train, then odd , slow movement in opposite direction of multi-lit object;2001-10-25 21:00:00;5 minutes;Bright blue fireball, no train, then odd , slow movement in opposite direction of multi-lit object Was driving home from work about 9 pm local time  briefly saw what appeared to be a bright blue fireball, only no train (tail) was visible. Object fell  to my east from south to north at about 35 degree angle.  Less than 2 minutes later an oddly lit object traveled from north to south from roughly the same area changing brightness and moving slowly.  I live a few miles from an Air Reserve Station (Kingsley Field) and have been watching and listening to much activity lately.  This does not conform, no sounds heard, object less than 3 miles away at closest point;42.2727946921444;-121.799603184713
7/9/02. Klamath Falls , OR 03:55, object travelling from SSE towards NNW accelerates at high speed and does 180 still accelerating;2002-07-09 03:55:00;90 seconds;7/9/02. Klamath Falls , OR 03:55, object travelling from SSE towards NNW accelerates at high speed and does 180 still accelerating I was reporting to work at the Klamath Falls Post Office when I noticed two of my co-werkers at the SW corner of the postal property. I came  up to them and asked why they were looking up in the night sky. They told me that they had heard that there would be a passing of the ISS at 03:55 that AM. I was to clock on at 04:00 so I thought I would whatch the event myself. My understanding was that the ISS would be passing from the SW. We whatched awile and then one of my co-workers said There it is! It was passing from the SE. It was slightly orange. My friend said that he had seen the ISS pass before and it had been a bright white light and slowly moving. We watched it move from the SSE towards the NNW we saw that it started to accelerate, maintained its accelaration and shortly after it passed over us it made a radical 180 degree turn of very tight trajectory almost back on its previous course and continued to accelerate back to the SSE and speed out of sight. The object did not change color coming or going. I was a Naval aircraft mechanic from 1968-1971 and do not believe that this was an aircraft presently in our inventory nor do I believe that we have vehicles that could demonstrate the technology necessary to achieve the air display that I witnessed. There was no sound. The object did not leave any sort of trail. I had the impression that the object was at a great altitude. There were no blinking lights on the object and it looked the same as it advanced, turned and then spead away.;42.2727946921444;-121.799603184713
Hwy 140 bright glowing light that followed for 45 minutes stopping abruptly and creating patterns.;2009-12-01 18:00:00;45 minutes;Hwy 140 bright glowing light that followed for 45 minutes stopping abruptly and creating patterns. When traveling towards Klamath Falls Oregon on hwy 140, from White City, Oregon, my fiance and I witnessed a bright glowing light that looked like a star, hovering very close to the tree line.   As we focused on it the light seemed to follow us.  When we became  were aware that  it really was following us we pulled over.  It stopped as we did.  At that time it would dart up and down and back and forth.  Stopping abruptly unlike any other flying object could.   As we continued to travel south on 140, we kept track of it following us.  Whenever we would stop, it would do the same thing as when we first stopped.   Finally reaching Lake of the Woods, which is 45 minutes from where we started, it stopped once again.  This time it was dipping in the sky, skipping as it decended.  Almost a smile pattern.   After it once again darted in the same plus pattern, it then started to come very close to my vehicle.  I got frightened and took off very quickly.  It seemed then to just disappear and fade into the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date may be approximate.
