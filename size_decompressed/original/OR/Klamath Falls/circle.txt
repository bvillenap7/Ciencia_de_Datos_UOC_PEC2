MY FRIEND (WITH ME AT THE TIME) WENT INTO OUR HOME AND CALLED POLICE TO REPORT.  SHE CAME BACK OUTSIDE TO WATCH WITH ME.  I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT I COULD NOT HELP BUT FEEL IT KNEW WE WERE WATCHING.  I DON'T KNOW WHY I DID THIS BUT I SAID OUT LOUD I KNOW YOU CAN SEE US.  JUST THEN THE OBJECT SEEMED TO SPEED ACROSS THE SKY AND HOVERED OVER OUR HOME.  ABOUT THREE MINUTES LATER IT SEEMED TO EXPLODE.  THE EXPLOSION WAS IN A PERFECT CIRCLE - AND VANASHED.  SEVERAL HOURS LATER THE KLAMATH FALL POLICE DEPARTMENT CALLED US BACK TO LET US KNOW ONE OF THEIR OFFICERS HAD ALSO SEEN THE OBJECT.  A FEW YEARS LATER I WAS WATCHING THE SIGHTINGS TV SHOW.  THEY SHOWED A VIDEO OF A GROUP OF PEOPLE WATCHING AN OBJECT JUST LIKE THE ONE MY FRIEND AND I SAW.  THE MAN FILMING THE OBJECT ALSO SEEMED TO BE TALKING TO IT!  BY THE WAY, THE POLICE DEPARTMENT RECOMENDED WE CALL THE AIRBASE.  WE DID THAT, WE WERE TRANSFERED TO THE ??TOWER COMMANDER?? WHO SAID THEY HAD NOT SEEN AN OBJECT.  THIS TOWER COMMANDER GAVE ME A PHONE NUMBER (SOMEWHERE IN NORTHER CA).  I CALLED THE NUMBER AND TALKED TO SOMEONE WHO TOLD ME WE GET CALLS FROM YOUR AREA ALL THE TIME.  I MAY HAVE REPORTED THIS TO YOU BEFORE - BUT NEVER HEARD BACK.  WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF YOU HAVE HEARD OF OBJECTS LIKE THIS ONE BEFORE?  IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THE EXPLOSION WAS JUST THE OBJECT LEAVING MY SIGHT AT A VERY HIGH RATE OF SPEED? ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));42.2727946921444;-121.799603184713
