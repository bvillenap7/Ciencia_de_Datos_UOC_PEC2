Descended 15 degrees in approximately 3 seconds. Object was observed in the city limits, however, I do not believe there was enough light to diminish an ionization trail. It was exceptionally bright, and lacking a standard color format, it was the color of a BLUE Christmas tree light. I am an aviation historian, and amateur radio operator, and I specialize in bouncing signals off of Meteor trails. I know of no substance that burns in this color, so will discount a Leonids meteor, which was prevalant at this time. Object was quite large, and no signs of diminshment in size, such as a meteor would display.;42.2727946921444;-121.799603184713
