At 1:35AM I heard what sounded like a helicopter flying above my neighbor’s house across the street.  My area usually does not have very many helicopters, so I peeked outside of my window to check it out. When I looked out, I instead saw a saucer flying at a slight angle (bottom facing me) directly above the street I live on. Usually you’d expect an aircraft to be flying quite a bit above the ground, but this UFO was about as high up as a 3-4 story building or a tall tree. I’m not very good at describing things, but the sound of the craft was akin to what a faraway helicopter sounds like. Not like when you are close to it and you can hear the blades, but just the general rumble of the helicopter. I’m not sure if the UFO had a bump on the bottom like stereotypical depictions, but I don’t recall seeing one. I was not able to see the top of the craft either. The UFO had small lights on the bottom, but not like you’d see on traditional UFO depictions. The lights were all over the place (more towards the middle than the outside of the saucer) and were colored red and blue. The lights were like looking at a distant street light, they were small and circular. I’d say the saucer was about the size of a jet, and it was very fast too. It was heading towards the nearby military airport as well. It got from where I lived on the outskirts of the city to the other side of the city in about 10-15 seconds. I personally believe that it was a military engineered aircraft, due to the fact it was flying so low, and heading towards the military airport with its lights on while flying straight over the city.;42.2727946921444;-121.799603184713
