My wife and I were in the back yard. I heard an prop driven aircraft and began to look for it (as I am an aviation buff). I spotted the plane heading south to north at about 3000 feet above ground level. We are about 4100 feet above sea level. As the aircraft passed overhead, I noticed another object moving north to south. I called my wife's attention to the object as well. The object looked metalic (silver and reflective)and resembled the shape of the early flying wings. My best estimation is that the object was 30 - 40 ft across and traveling at an altitude of 15,000 - 20,000 feet. There were no visible lights or strobes. It was higher than the aircraft we spotted, But lower than a jet that left a contrail a few moments before. The object was moving much faster than the jet and made no sound. It continued in a staight line until out of sight (about 30 seconds). We continued looking up while discussing what the object may have been. After about one and a half minutes we noticed two more objects of the same shape and configuration flying in the same direction as the first. They were at about the same altitude and speed. They flew parallel to each other about 800 ft apart. Again no sound and were visible for the same duration. We continued to look in the direction that the objects came from. After about another minute or so another object was spotted. It continued overhead as the others had done. However, at about 30 degrees past directly overhead the object appeared to perform a single roll or steep bank which showed a distict reflective property. The object continued on for a short distance then veered off to the left then veered back to it's original path until out of sight. The prevailing wind at the surface was from the south west. The clouds and contrails were drifiting in a north easterly direction. ((NUFORC Note:  We have invited the witnesses to submit illustrations of what they observed.

Translucent or Cloaked V shaped totally silent craft with 5 very dim lights underneath.;2020-07-15 22:30:00;7 seconds;Translucent or Cloaked V shaped totally silent craft with 5 very dim lights underneath. I was looking in the sky for the comet Neowise, and before I went into the house I looked to the southern sky and saw a V shaped translucent or cloaked craft approximately 40ft wide 50ft long with 5 round very dim lights (1 light at the front or nose and 3 on each side underneath the craft) moving about 100mph,500 feet above the ground and totally silent. It came from the southeast and kept heading northwest.  It was almost unnoticeable but the distortion of the sky and stars as it passed over gave it away.  It was thrilling to see but gave me a spooky feeling as well. This is my first UFO sighting and I felt I needed to report a craft with this capability flying through our airspace undetected.;42.2727946921444;-121.799603184713
