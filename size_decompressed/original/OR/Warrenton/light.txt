Non-Moving flashing light dissapears suddenly into the sky;2012-08-20 22:10:00;20 minutes;Non-Moving flashing light disappears suddenly into the sky Living on the coast of Oregon my family and I saw from a distance a non moving flashing light of Red Green/Yellow and White.  We considerd it not to be a UFO untill we realized it had'nt moved for over twenty minutes and as we watched longer it suddenly dissoved away in the same position. it was to far away to be described as a certain shape but it wasnt too far above the grounds/ocean. it was similar to a close star with obvious different features.;46.1447000000005;-123.9249
