Men In Black Encounter in Oregon;1980-06-25 10:00:00;5 minutes;Men In Black Encounter in Oregon   In aprox. 1980, on a late spring day, I was driving up to Oregon when I somehow got off on a logging road which was winding along a steep mountain. After a while, I noticed that the road was narrowing, and I was afraid to follow it any further. I decided to try and turn my car around, and drive back to Cave Junction, Oregon which was about 30 minutes away. As I was backing up the car, it went off of the road, and the rear end of the car was off the road and the car was tottering. I slowly got out, and was trying to figure out how to get my dogs out, which were in their kennel in the back of the car. If I tried to reach them, the car could tumble down the cliff. While I was trying to decide what to do, a big car pulled up, and 4 tall oriental men, with a strange skin tone, ( too orange ) got out of the car. In spite of the 100+ degree heat of the day, they were all wearing black trench coats.  I said Hello, and they did not reply. Without a word, they went to the front of my car, and picked it up, and sat it back in the road, facing the direction back to home.  I do not think that even twice that number of humans could have lifted my car from the front end only and place it on the road. I do not remember how I got past their car, or they passed mine, as they were headed up the fire break road as I was originally as well. The after thought of the encounter left me really scared, and as soon as I was back in town, I rented a hotel room and slept for a couple of days. This experience is also written about in Dongoâ€™s The Alien Tide (pg 16) I apologize for reporting this some 40 years later. Those weird men on the mountain saved our lives, but they still scared me. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));42.1325;-123.6252
