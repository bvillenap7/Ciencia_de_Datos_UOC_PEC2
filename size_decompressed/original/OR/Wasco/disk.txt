It was on a Sundaythe town was quit like most sundays mornings. I was out feeding my brothers dog. Looked up and there it was.  It made no noise.  It was between our back fence and the state highway . The highway was less than 100 yards. I guess it to be 75 yards out and 75 up .  What it look like:It was round like a frisby .Take take the outer edge of a frisby it is inch to inch and one half wide. The craft outer edge was 3 to 4 feet wide.  Also the outer edge must have been paneled offthere was a light moveing around the craft frome one panel to the next.  Take a frisby put a bowl on top then put one small one on the bottom .  I watch it for about one minute made arun to the house to get a camera. By the time mom came out with it it moved off to the east at the same hight.  The camea was old time she got it ready it was gone.   The weather was clearand sunny like it is most days in the summer in eastern Oregon.  Now it could have been U.S. Air Force air craft or something from Russia. Or a UFO because there is no swamp gas in Easter Oregon;45.5974;-120.7304
