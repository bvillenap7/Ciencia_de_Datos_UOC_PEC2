Fast moving object high altitude no wings the classic cigar shape.  ((anonymous report));2019-06-19 10:00:00;15 seconds;Fast moving object high altitude no wings the classic cigar shape. It was around 10:00 am.  I was facing West with the sun at my back.  I could see what appeared to be an airplane at a very high altitude moving fast.  There was no vapor trail.  The unusual part was you could not see any wings.  The aircraft UFO was moving fast but at such a high altitude, it had the classic “cigar” shape.  The color of the object was white.   Occasionally it would seem to be greyer.  It was so high there was no indication of flames, lights, windows, just a smooth cigar shape, no detail.  I am used to seeing the satellites at night such as the ISS and I am very familiar with military aircraft and commercial airliners they fly over our house all the time.  This time it was different it raced across the sky traveling from the North heading in a South (Southwest) direction.   The sky was mostly clear with a few clouds but this vehicle was different. Its path never varied and eventually I could not see it.  My daughter said she could still see it after I sai! d I could not.  I was hoping to see if anyone else happen to see it.
