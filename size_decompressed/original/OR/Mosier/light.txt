Blue/White Light Gives Calm Feeling In Mosier, Oregon;1999-07-15 01:00:00;20 Seconds;Blue/White Light Gives Calm Feeling In Mosier, Oregon I woke up from sleeping one summer night, and made my way to the master bathroom adjacent to my bedroom. I was still a bit groggy and not fully awake. The bathroom had a window just above the water closet and I could see out to the back yard of the house as I was urinating. I noticed a very bright blueish/white light on, shining down from above the house, and in seeing it, said to myself, someone must have left the floodlight on out back. Then it occured to me, wait a minute, we don't have a floodlight in the back yard. As soon as this thought came to me, I was fully awake and in a flash I was, I guess I would call it, consumed or flushed by this very very calm and peaceful feeling and the blue/white light (LEDish in color) then slowly moved down from over the top of the house to the backyard. I watched it without any fear whatsoever. It came between a 200 year oak and the house. It did not pass behind the tree which was about 30 feet from the house. The win! dow had a type of vision glass (not frosted) that made it impossible for me to see the exact shape of this light. It slowly moved to the left and was about to go out of view when I ran into the bedroom to get a better view of what the heck it was, but it was gone.  It only took me, maybe 2 seconds, to go from the bathroom to the bedroom. There was no noise at all. That's it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
