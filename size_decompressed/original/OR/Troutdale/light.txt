Fast Moving Light;2005-04-26 21:45:00;5 seconds;Fast Moving Light Traveling west on I-5, 18 miles before Troutdale, Oregon 21:45 PM Tuesday April 26th. A round white light crossed my field of vision (south to north), in about five seconds. It seemed to be going too fast for a jet.  I leaned across the seat and looked out the rolled down passenger side window to make sure it was not a reflection. I saw it as it disappeared behind the hills. It maintained a consistent altitude. The light was too big to be a light from an airplane. Maybe the size of an eraser on a #2 pencil held at arms length. A slight haze around it. It covered a lot of distance quickly.;45.5254;-122.3739
