Giant triangle in the western sky.  Red lights.  Missing time!;2014-10-06 22:30:00;2-3 minutes;Giant triangle in the wetern sky.  Red lights.  Missing time! I live under a busy flightpath that goes east to west into PDX International Airport.  I am also an aviation enthusiast, and know about specific types of aircraft. It was about 10:30 at night, and it was pretty clear.  I could see the stars.  I heard a commercial passenger plane flying overhead on approach to PDX.  Which isn't unusual.  I couldnt sleep that night so I went to my window to take a look.  I watched it until it passed over the trees and out of sight.  Then I started looking at the stars that were visible that night, then I saw three red pinpoints of light, that were arranged in a triangle formation. They did not flicker or twinkle and stayed locked in that rigid triangle formation. Then i noticed that it seemed like one solid object, because it blocked out the stars as it moved from dead south to dead north. After a few seconds, i thought I heard a low hum as it passed overhead.  I watched the object for what felt like a solid 2-3 minutes, but when I looked at the clock, the time just turned to 1:30 in the morning... I started watching the object at 10:30.  I lost three hours of time.  I didnt get any sleep that night, I just sat in bed scared to close my eyes until the sun came up over Mt. Hood.;45.5254;-122.3739
