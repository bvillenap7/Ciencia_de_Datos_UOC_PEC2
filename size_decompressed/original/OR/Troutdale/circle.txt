Two objects seen passing together over Troutdale, Oregon, at 9:17 pm;2007-08-30 21:17:00;2 minutes;Two objects seen passing together over Troutdale, Oregon, at 9:17 pm I just wanted to put this in the record somewhere:   Last night, at 21:17 to 21:18 hrs we (four of us) were standing on my back deck looking at the night sky.  It was 75 degrees outside, clear, and no wind.  At the same time, we saw two objects pass together moving in a straight path from NNW to SSE. They were easy to see as they passed overhead. They were not points of light, but rather two round 'balls' about 1/4 the apparent diameter of the moon, they were bright, but not as bright as the moon.  No lights were visible on these objects, yet they were bright and easy to see.  Anyone looking up at the sky at that time couldn't have missed this.  It was really spectacular.  They were visible until they faded from view as they approached the southern horizon.  The two objects appeared to quickly move back and forth very close to each other every second or so in near synchrony during the two minutes it took for them to cross the sky. Two of us thought they may have been quickly circling each other as they passed over.  It was very, very strange. It was impossible to determine their altitude or speed, but together they passed over us at about the same speed as a passing satellite.;45.5254;-122.3739
