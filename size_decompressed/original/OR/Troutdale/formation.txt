Looking south 2 white star lights were noticed as unfamiliar stars at roughly 40 degrees above the horizon spread vertically roughly 5-8 degrees.  Upon closer inspection, they were moving as one with a very faint white glow between the two.  It appeared to increase speed and departure angle leaving our perceivable vision at roughly 65-70 degrees above the horizon.  At this point we discussed and believe what we saw began in our atmosphere.  Its movement was steady, stable, and smooth.  At first spot it appeared as 2 stars that should not be there quickly changed to low orbit satellites and quickly to those are connected, that is huge, and that is moving extremely fast.  Whatever it was, to us it was pretty awesome to see and to wonder about.;45.5254;-122.3739
