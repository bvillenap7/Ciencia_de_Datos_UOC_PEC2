Fireball floating in sky;2012-08-18 21:30:00;5 minutes;Fireball floating in sky My husband and I were in our back yard at 9:30 this evening when I noticed a large orange sphere in the sky. It was moving slowly from north to south.  Then took a slight turn southeast. It looked like a glowing fireball.  We called our son and his girlfriend out to see it also.  It eventually flickered out. It moved very slowly and seemed low.;45.5254;-122.3739
