Extremely bright and fast UFO over Troutdale, OR;2007-04-13 20:50:00;15 Seconds;Extremely bright and fast UFO over Troutdale, OR UFO traveling (generally) from Southeast to Northwest, then changing directions over Troutdale to East to West, to Portland, OR. (in slow motion, it’s movement would have seemed like that of a hummingbird)  Object traveling at extremely high rate of speed and traveling at approximately 1000 ft. altitude. Object traveled distance from Troutdale and out of sight past Portland in less than 5 seconds (over 26 miles- 18000mph?). Light emanating from object extremely bright (like a steady camera flash), white, but sort of wiggling and flashing- as if object was tumbling through the air. Object was completely silent. Object was erratic- sort of changing directions, but traveling in a general Westerly direction. Passenger jet flew across object’s flight path South to North on the way to PDX. I am curious to know if any of the passengers witnessed this object!;45.5254;-122.3739
