Aug, 5, 2013  9:59 pm  Huge bright white light moving slowly heading almost magnetic north.  It moved so slow that it almost seemed to stop. I watched it for almost 6 minutes, until it disappeared behind some trees.                        Compared to commercial jets flying over the object is really low and a 100 x bigger when comparing it to jet lights.                                                                                                                                             I have seen this before and it is only in the summer and it usually comes from the west heading in about  same direction as magnetic north.  This time it a lot further SW then the previous times, and seemed to be following a straight path.                                            My location is N 44*36’59.9” W 123*26’9” Benton County, Oregon.;44.5528;-123.3928
NW Sky West to East 3min of individual bright lights, Traveling 1.5X sattelite speed BRIGHTEST THINGS in Sky.;2020-10-14 06:05:00;3 minutes;NW Sky West to East 3min of individual bright lights, Traveling 1.5X sattelite speed BRIGHTEST THINGS in Sky. As bright as the moon, moving west to east passing over the last star in the handle of the big dipper, so maybe 35deg above the horizon. All matched Speed and random distancing however, seemed to be somewhat evenly spaced. Some small grouping (3) per group. Appeared out of west, fading up into full brightness from the same spot, running in a fairly straight line to the east, covering aprox 1/3 of the center of the sky.  From fade in to fade out, aprox 60sec.  Speed would be the same as an cessna 182 @ 1000ft AGL at level flight speed. I have been involved with Aviation since 1969, and this is my first reporting of this type of event.  I have experienced others in the past, but usually way out to sea and off the standard jetway.  Somebody else HAD TO HAVE ALSO got this show.  This was way way to obvious.;44.5528;-123.3928
