As my husband and I drove East on 34 shortly before the turn-off for Mary's Peak, I spotted a bright non-moving rectangle it the sky.  I watched it long enough to realize it was odd and pointed it out to my husband.  We pulled the car over after watching it a bit longer but by the time we got out the car to get a better look (within less than 10 seconds) it had disappeared.;44.5528;-123.3928
