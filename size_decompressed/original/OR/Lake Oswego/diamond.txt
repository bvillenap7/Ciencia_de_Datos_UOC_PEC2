Diamond shaped, black, large, flat craft with 3 or 4 white lights and 1 red blinking light hovering in Lake Oswego, OR.;2013-11-25 19:30:00;3-4 minutes;Diamond shaped, black, large, flat craft with 3 or 4 white lights and 1 red blinking light hovering in Lake Oswego, OR Occurred:  11/25/13 7:30 p.m. Location:  Lake Oswego, OR  Shape:  Diamond or triangle and it seemed to be double decked and had 3 or 4 white lights on it and one blinking red light. Duration:  3â€“4 minutes  Witnesses:  2   My teen daughter and I were driving home last night at around 7:30 p.m. in the Bryant Woods neighborhood.  As we traveled south (towards the fire station) and took a left onto Deerbrush, we both noticed a large, bright white light low in the sky on our left.  It was too large, low in the sky and bright to be a star or planet.  And it wasn't moving so we knew it wasn't a plane.   As we drove closer to the light it became apparent it was a large, diamond shaped black object hovering over an area to our left (maybe as far off as over Childs street or closer over the Bryant Woods nature park area).   I pulled the car over right behind Lakeridge Jr. High and we turned around in our seats and watched the craft for about 3 minutes as it just floated/hovered in the same spot.  Then it started moving and flew over Lakeridge Jr. High.  It went behind a tree line and we couldn't see it anymore. My daughter doesn't want to talk about this and is scared which is why I'm even following up on this.  I'm not scared but I want to know if anyone else saw the craft.  Strangely no one else was out walking in our neighborhood (which is usually busy with foot traffic and people jogging or walking their dogs--even on dark, winter night).  I remarked to my daughter that great, no other cars are driving now and no one else is out so we didn't see anyone else that saw what we saw.   The whole thing was weird.  We both wondered at first if it was a drone but as it became more clear to us it was too large (we thought) to be a drone.;45.4118507246376;-122.70694057971
