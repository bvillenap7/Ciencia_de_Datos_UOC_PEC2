Oregon UFO Review Case:  Football shaped UFO with purple glow and lights seen from inside tent during camping.;2003-06-07 02:00:00;5 seconds;Football shaped UFO with purple glow and lights seen from inside tent during camping. The 15 year old witness had not quite gone to sleep yet as he lay looking out at the stars through the mesh of the tent at his friends yard. Two shooting stars had been spotted already when an object about the size of the moon came into view at a rapid rate of speed.  The witness writes...I saw what looked to be a football shaped object with a neon-purple shield fly across the sky. In the center of the craft there were 5 or 6 lights that looked like they weren't set up in any order. From the distance that I was, it looked like the lights probably had a diameter of 6-10 feet.  The first contact was made by the mother through the OUFOR hotline the following night. Investigator Bill Coones was contacted and visited with the witness and his mother at their home picking up a few more details. Bill noted that the craft had a black body surrounded by a purple glow. The light was not reflected light in the witness estimation but glowing on its own. There were lights randomly spaced within the surrounding purple glow. The object went right overhead. It did not turn or change direction. There was no sound. Bills compass said the initial view was to the north and it went in a straight line and behind the trees to the south. The object was first sighted approximately 35 degrees (as by his angle finder) above level. It crossed directly overhead and was last seen at about 30 degrees to the south before the trees hid the view which was shown to him by the witness on the street.  Investigator Coones had some conversation about the UFO phenomenon with the witness and his mother and got the impression that the field was almost brand new to them as they were amazed at some matter of fact things he told them about things in this field of study. Below is a picture taken by Coones of where in the sky the object was seen and a drawing by the witness.
