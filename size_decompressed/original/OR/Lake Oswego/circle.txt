I awoke at 3:20 am for no apparent reason.  I then turned to look over my shoulder where I could see the window.  I noticed a flash of light, then looked up and saw a round bright white-yellow disk of light hovering up in the sky.  It appeared to have a beam of light coming out of it.;45.4118507246376;-122.70694057971

About 3 or 4 times a week, I hear the airforce flying over. On January 5 around 1430 I heard that roar from a jet and I looked up to see two F-15 fighter jets. I grabbed my phone from my pocket to take a couple pictures and I saw something else up there with them. This object was much larger than the two jets and looked to be kind of blurry almost. It was like something I have never seen ever! Actually, it was almost like a picture trying to come through on an old 1950s television set. I was able to get three pictures of this thing. In picture 1, looks like the object is not moving or moving very slowly. In picture 2, looks like the object starts to speed up as the jets are passing by. Then in picture 3, very much looks like the object is moving at a much higher rate of speed. I looked down at my phone to see if I was able to actually capture this on camera and I did. But then I looked back up to see if it was still there and it was gone. Honestly, I didn't think too much into it until my girlfriend came home and I told her about what I saw. Then she told me about her coworker. Her coworker's husband was hiking on Mt. Hood and saw the same strange object in the sky at the same time I did and he also got some pictures and possibly a short video. He did not see or hear the F-15 jets though.;45.4118507246376;-122.70694057971
