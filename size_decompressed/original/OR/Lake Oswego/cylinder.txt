Brilliant blue oblong object zooms horizontally across southern sky at 2 in the morning.;2005-11-10 02:00:00;a few very long seconds;Brilliant blue oblong object zooms horizontally across southern sky at 2 in the morning. I awoke suddenly because of the silence.  Rain had been thundering on the glass ceiling, but suddenly I woke up realizing the rain had stopped and there was complete silence (I sleep with windows open.)   I looked at the clock ... 2 AM ... and I looked at the sky through the glass ceiling. (I live on a lake so have a clear view of the southern sky with no interference from trees, lights or houses.)  Every star in the universe was shining and suddenly, across the horizon, zoomed a brilliant blue something ... from west to east. Horizontal, no arc. Fast. Huge. I described it to a friend who said it was a Blue Fireball.  It was a beautiful experience.;45.4118507246376;-122.70694057971
