My boyfriend and I saw 3 peach colored lights (spheres) hovering for about 20 minutes over the south sky.;1999-07-12 22:15:00;20 mins.;My boyfriend and I saw 3 peach colored lights (spheres) hovering for about 20 minutes over the south sky. My boyfriend and I decided to go for a walk about 9:30 p.m.  We are 28 and 30 I am a college writing instructor, and he is an electrician. Neither of us have sighted a UFO before. We were returning from our walk, about 5 minutes from our home, when my boyfriend pointed to the south sky and said look, twins, jokingly. As I turned to look, I at first assumed they were planes, but as my boyfriend and I continued to look, the two lights stayed in exactly the same spot, parallel to each other and about two inches apart if you were to measure the distance with your fingers.  The objects were about twice the size an brightness of Venus, which at the time was off in the west sky. We were dumbfounded, and even though I kept repeating They must be planes, we both clearly saw and stated that they were not acting like planes.  They stayed in exactly the same place, pulsating but not flashing. Then, to our amazement, a third appeared, seemingly out of nowhere, to form a triangle to the other two. The third was not as bright at first, but then grew in brightness to look just like the other two.  They remained in this inverted triangle formation for some time, a few minutes or so.  At this point, a car with 4 young men in it, all aged between about 18 and 22, drove up beside us, also having seen the sight. They said they'd seen it down on the road, and were looking for a clearer view of it.  At the time, we were up on a hill. We all agreed that these did not appear to be planes, and my boyfriend and myself expressed that we were glad not to be the only ones to see it.  The men drove off, and said goodbye pleasantly. Then, the light in the upper left corner of the triangle began to leave.  It moved slowly to the east, decreasing in brightness rather quickly.  Still the other two remained in the same spot. Then the bottom sphere began to follow the first one, heading in the same path.  The last one remained in the same spot for about 5 more minutes, an we watched, not moving.  Then, it too began to head east.  We followed it, as our apartment is in that direction.  We thought we might be able to run in the house, grab the binocs, come back out and catch it...but by the time we came out it was gone. My boyfriend and I stayed out there, watching the sky for about another 15 minutes, but saw nothing.  We both agreed that neither of us had ever seen any objects in the sky behave that way in our lives. We're both familiar with planes, because we see them in the sky all the time, and saw many tonight.  Portland airport is not far from here. But I know in my gut these were not planes.  They felt different.;45.4118507246376;-122.70694057971

After about 2 minutes of observation I spotted a 3 light formation directly overhead moving slowly from N.W. to S.E. Estimated altitude was minimum 40,000ft. to orbit altitude. The formation was  that of a triangle if you connected them together but not a perfect triangle (all three sides would be different lengths) I do not believe this was one object but 3 separate objects since stars could be seen between them. Each object was not larger than a star or satelite. Each one of the lights were moving in sync with each other as if connected. After about 5minutes of travel across the sky (observed through binoculars) each light separately went out with the last light to go out being the brightest. I am a Private pilot (glider rating) and have 100's of UFO sighting's (90%) daytime -one as close as 50 feet!;45.4118507246376;-122.70694057971
A white Ord light that keeps passing over;2006-06-17 10:02:00;5 seconds;A white Ord light that keeps passing over Ok for the pass 10 months I been seeing this strange object, its always looks like its a star if stand still, but it moves slow or medium speed. usaliy I see this object during twlight times from day to night, by the way I seen it in the winter and summer so those times change from within five hours of each other. I just saw it again, moving slow, slower then a plane, but you know its a craft and I been seeing it do many different moves over the pass months. I seen it blink multpy times from place to place, heading over in different parts of the sky, but mostly it just does a slow control course through the sky. Now its always white object, like a star and there is no other light colors that would suggest this was a plane. I think its some type of govonment plane, since I keep seeing the same type of object or same craft over my street and house. No where else in the town but where I live I see it. It is with out thought a UFO and not like a normal plane. I know it doesn't sound much like a great UFO story, but its constant coming over my street and everytime I try to film, or grab camara, it always disappers when I come back out(where it is slowly moving across the middle of the sky), So thats all I can report, I just hope someone else has been seening it and not just me.;45.4118507246376;-122.70694057971
Three large yellow/red lights travelling northeast at a rapid consistent rate.;2012-01-25 19:05:00;5 min;Three large yellow/red lights travelling northeast at a rapid consistent rate. 3 large yellow/red lights moving rapidly at same rate below cloud cover travelling in northeast direction, appearing to be gaining altitude until they either burnt out or went above cloud cover. Observers are a family of 4, mother, father and two sons.  The father of the family thinks that the final light appeared to be triangular in shape.  The mother did not notice this. bright flash in bellingham area. A flash of light lit my whole house. My dog freaked out.  At the same time a friend who lives 15 miles away witnessed this same light and his dog freaked out aswell.  I was wondering if anyone else noticed this.  I have never seen a UFO and don't nessasarly beleive in them, but I can not think of another explaination.  My girlfriend has witnessed a similar occurance.  Winter lighting???

Four distinct Orangish /red lights in sky in an arc over Lake Oswego, Oregon at just at dusk, moving west east then slowly fading away;2013-04-26 20:00:00;3-5 minutes;Four distinct Orangish /red lights in sky in an arc over Lake Oswego, Oregon, at just at dusk, moving west east then slowly fading away Entering Blue Heron Easement on the south side of Lake Oswego just after sunset Friday evening, we saw three orangish red dots in the sky spaced apart in an arc (a fourth was lagging behind and lower in the sky slightly to the west).  The dots (lights) were moving across the sky, not dropping, we sat and watched wondering what the heck they were and slowly each one faded, starting with the light furthest east. There was an early evening star in the sky and also an airplane ... for reference.  It was obvious these objects were not a star, not an airplane, not a satellite. These appeared to be four distinct objects.;45.4118507246376;-122.70694057971
2 orange/red lights seen over Lake Oswego at night;2013-06-09 22:30:00;3 minutes;2 orange/red lights seen over Lake Oswego at night On Sunday, 06/09/2013 a friend and I were sitting outside on my porch in Lake Oswego, just talking, when my friend pointed out 2 orange/red-ish lights in the sky.  We thought they were just meteors  until we noticed they began to change speeds and started juking left and right.  At this point, my friend and I called out my girlfriend to come witness it, but she thought nothing of it and went back inside once the lights proceeded to fade.  A few seconds after the 2 red orange lights faded, 2 faint white lights (almost appeared to look like a far-away star) appeared where they had disappeared and began to move rapidly in an upwards direction.  These lights where now moving against gravity at a speed that was too fast to be any aircraft or star. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.
