Standing in my back yard I saw a object in the sky that looked like a star.  It was to early for stars and that got my attention.  It slowly moved in from the north.   As it got closer it appeared to be sphirical.  It didnt appear to change altitudes as it moved.   It hovered above for around five minutes and then moved of to the south west.  At times the light appeared to pulsate. It gave me goosebumps.  Two other people witnessed this with me.  They were weirded out as well.;45.4118507246376;-122.70694057971
