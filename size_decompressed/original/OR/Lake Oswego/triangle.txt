OREGON UFO REVIEW REPORT:  Slow moving silent black triangle craft observed over Nansen Park Lake Oswego Oregon;2010-07-24 23:45:00;2 minutes;Slow moving silent black triangle craft observed over Nansen Park Lake Oswego Oregon Occurred :  7/24/2010 11:45pm  Submitted to NUFORC By:  Cameron Johnson, Director of the Oregon UFO Review 2 (OUFOR2)  Reported:  7/28/2010 10:35 am  Posted:  8/4/2010  Location:  Portland, OR ( Mountain Park area )  Shape:  Triangle Duration: 2 minutes Large silent black triangle coming from the west and traveling towards the northeast. I received this report through the online report form on this site.  I have met with the witness who wishes to remain anonymous due to his position as a doctor in the community.  The witness was very adamant that he saw what he described and seemed like a very level headed man.  This is a preliminary report on this sighting and there will be follow ups posted as more information becomes available to the OUFOR2.  Below is the information from the online sighting report. Date of sighting: 7/24/2010   Event time: 11:45pm   Event duration: 2 minutes   Altitude of craft: 500 to 1000 feet   Approximate size of craft: 100 to 200 feet across the flat sides ( Equilateral triangle)    (Weather conditions added by OUFOR2 after researching)  Weather conditions: Clear skies, moon lit night. State: Oregon  Country: USA   Zip Code: 97219 (Mountain Park area of Portland )    Number of witnesses to the event: 1   Shape of craft if any: Triangular   Number of craft seen: 1  F Full sighting description from witness statement:   I was walking my dog out to do his nightly business in the park near my home (Nansen Park ) and while I was waiting for him to finish up I caught sight of something out of the corner of my left eye to the west of me and turned to look.  I saw 3 whitish lights moving towards me ( to the east ) at what I thought was about 500 to 1000 feet in the air. As it drew closer I was able to make out the crafts shape as triangular in fashion. It drifted slowly over head and away to the northeast and seemed to speed up the further it got from me until it was gone. There was no sound that I could hear and my dog did not react to it at all. I would like to know what this may have been, but, due to my being a doctor I request to be kept anonymous in the public eye. Contact info withheld by request of the witness. Initial findings:  I met with the witness on 7/28/2010 in the park and asked him a barrage of the usual questions and from first impressions I found him to be a stable intelligent man without an agenda or any obvious deceptive statements.  He seemed truly perplexed and concerned about the sighting and was not making any rash statements about it being an alien craft or a craft of known origins. He seemed fairly savvy on the local ( usual ) air traffic in his neighborhood too.  He did repeat several times that â€œ It was like nothing I have every seen before.  The OUFOR2 will be conducting further checks with the FAA at the PDX tower and also by contacting the Oregon Air National Guard at PDX as well. OUFOR2 has already checked the weather conditions for the sighting date and has confirmed that the witnesses statement and the official weather conditions match. Shown below are views of the location via map and also forensic models built to illustrate the witnesses sighting.  The witness has viewed the forensic reconstruction models and has agreed that they closely represent what he viewed that night. There has been added detail to the forensic model from information that the witness expounded upon during our interview.  These models are NOT 100% accurate as to what may have been witnessed since there was only one witness and no photographs or videos taken.;45.4118507246376;-122.70694057971

The very last one I had taken was accidental and I realized there was something different about it, something that had appeared in the sky.  When I looked up it was clear as day, three white circular lights... I thought maybe I was not seeing correctly,  and when I looked to take another photo it was gone.;45.4118507246376;-122.70694057971
