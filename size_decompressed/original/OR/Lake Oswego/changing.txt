Dark, squarish non-aerodynamic object floating at high altitude from south to north.;2005-04-02 16:20:00;2 minutes;Dark, squarish non-aerodynamic object floating at high altitude from south to north. I initially saw the object from the driver's side of my car as I approached my house. After parking my car, I went immediately to our south facing outside deck.  The object was dark in apparent color and in my initial view of it seemed to be squarish in shape. It had caught my attention because it definitely was not a powered airplane or helicopter and made no noise. I've lived in our house for 17 yrs. and am used to seeing and hearing aircraft flying over from the south towards PDX.  There was cloud cover (elevation of which I have not yet been able to confirm) and the object appeared to be at least 2,500 ft. in altitude.  As for it being an ultra-light or a powered or unpowered hang-glider, it did not to my naked eye appear to have any sort of aerodynamic shape. It was slowly moving from south to north and it seemed to almost be tumbling or rotating through the air and in so doing presenting different shape and outline profiles.  I will supply some sketches as a supplement to this text.;45.4118507246376;-122.70694057971
Large silver object appears in clear sky, then vanishes as though suddenly sucked away;2007-07-31 15:00:00;15 seconds;Large silver object appears in clear sky, then vanishes as though suddenly sucked away I am a grade school librarian with no background in science.  I was driving North from the Stafford Basin, when a full view of sky suddenly revealed an object straight in front of me which appeared to be spinning.  It was flat, metallic, circular, full of light. It almost seemed transluscent, like those sailor of the wind jellyfish that appear on the Oregon Coast from time to time.  As I drove my car out onto the road from a wooded area, the image assumed a pencil shape, still silvery.  I might have thought for just a moment that it was a plane, that I had misinterpreted somehow what I first saw, but within perhaps 15 seconds (?) of my first sighting, it was suddenly sucked away at enormous speed and vanished utterly --UTTERLY-- from the horizon.  The sky was clear and wide open to my view, and there was nothing in it to see. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and she sounded to us to be quite serious-minded and credible.
