It overlooks a large area of forest and some private neighborhoods.  We were smoking a cigarette, when I suddenly spotted what I thought was the glow of a car headlight, but then realized it was slowly sailing over the very top of the treeline in the forest.  We were higher in elevation than the craft so we were looking down upon it, which was approx a quarter mile away from us.   It was very clearly seen upon focusing and it was just an orange ball of light.  It was really slow and hovered over the treeline in a somewhat straight line that headed kind of towards us.  We could eventually see that it may of had a searchlight or something like that and it was shining it down into the forest like it was looking for something.   It was really strange and we have both never seen something like this.  It was so obviously clear and absolutely couldn't have been anything else, we were certain of what we saw.  It sort of vanished from view after moving behind taller trees but it seemed that it should've still been visible, although it never re-appeared.  We both felt like we had lost ourselves in the sighting and had to collect our senses afterwards.;45.4118507246376;-122.70694057971
