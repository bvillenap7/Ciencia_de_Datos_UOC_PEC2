Noon sighting of multiple fast moving objects;2019-08-31 12:20:00;30 seconds;Noon siting of multiple fast moving objects I witnessed a large group (15-20) - quick approximate) of grayish egg shaped objects moving very fast at what appears to be high altitude.  No discernible sounds was heard but that may not be surprising given its high altitude. Many change position as they moved.  You can see this in the video.;45.4118507246376;-122.70694057971
