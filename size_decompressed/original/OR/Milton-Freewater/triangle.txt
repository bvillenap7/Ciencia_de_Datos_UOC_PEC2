I was about to enter my trailer after feeding my dog, and heard ambulances and sirens outside, but didn't think much about it until I looked up and seen three lights in a triangular formation nearly out of site. The thing seemed huge maybe a mile across.  It traveled in pretty much a straight line until it disapeared beihind some trees. I ran inside to try and get my wife to come out, but she wouldn't.  SO, I went back outside and could only make it out going behind some trees. Not usre if the sirens I heard were related or not didn't see it again or hear anything more on it all night. I seen a video on before it's news and the lights they showed on their seemed very much the same as what I seen.;45.9493;-118.3864

Girlfriend was outside and yelled for me to come look I seen a large triangular flying object at first Dark no lights then red lights started flashing  Then noticed another coming red lights flashing It was not far off ground silent no noise slowly  Moving then it appeared to hover and the one following  Was catching up these seem to be coming from east Moving northeast so quietly...  I captured video On my phone best i can made several short videos  The length of 1st one looked like 3 lengths of a 747 The 2nd maybe 2 lengths of a 747 hard to tell depth And perception of them being so dark.
