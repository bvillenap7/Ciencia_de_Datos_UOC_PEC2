Friday October 5th, 2007, at approximately 10:00 pm, “dancing balls of light” were seen from the North end of Milton-Freewater, Oregon, for over an hour by two neighbors. 	The display was first seen from the west side of a neighborhood in North MIlton-Freewater, and slowly moved East on top of a cloud formation. Three light balls were counted, but only two of which interacted with each other in a playful dancing motion, while the third spent most of the time hovering to the left. 	No light trail from any angle was visible, nor did the balls of light move in any uniformed pattern. They resembled the shape of Saturn, with a horizontal plane piercing through the center of their somewhat oval shape. The size of these light balls were relatively close to the size of a full moon but had no defined lines or color. 	The balls of light moved above a cloud formation heading East. When the spectators stopped at the East end of Raspberry Loop to watch them, a dancing display captured their attention till nearly 11:00 pm. Mostly viewed where chasing motions from each direction, spiral patterns, and the occasionally collisions resulting in a spark of extra light. 	When the two spectators headed back to the West side of the street, the balls of light shifted in the direction they were walking. Finding this a fascinating turn of events, the viewers waved goodbye to the balls of light, to be replied to with a quick up and down motion from both lights and then a disappearance. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length via telephone with this witness.  She seemed to us to be unusually sober-minded, and we suspect that she is an excellent witness.  If anyone else witnessed the lights, or knows what their cause was, we would welcome additional information about the event.  PD));45.9493;-118.3864

It did not move, and appeared to be distant. I witnessed a hovering yellow-ish light.  It was too high to be a tower and was behind the hills that hold many wind turbines that use red flashing lights.  The light was too strong to be a star, and did not flash or move.  It stayed exactly in one spot for several minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));45.9493;-118.3864

They circled around the cloud bank for about 5 minutes then took off across the sky at a high rate of speed towards the southeast. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to provide no contact information.
