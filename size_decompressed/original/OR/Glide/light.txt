Slow flashing light over ridge. Three of us watched for an hour. Stopped flashing after we all noticed. Looks like plasma on video.;2020-08-08 04:02:00;1 hour;Slow flashing light over ridge. Three of us watched for an hour. Stopped flashing after we all noticed. Looks like plasma on video. Unstable light. Moved slowly higher over the course of the hour. Flashed slowly over the first ten or so minutes. Then was solid light after that. Over the ridge Deep in BLM land. Zoomed in on camera and recorded the flashing for almost six minutes. Looks as if plasma in video spinning. When the light flashed out and it went completely back we all saw a black hole behind where the light had been. After we saw the thing the moon changed as well. I saw two red crescent moons connected yet warped out of the moon. The two others with me saw almost the same but not red.;43.3046;-123.1019
