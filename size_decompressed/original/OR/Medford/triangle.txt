Bright flickering light in southwestern sky.;2001-02-12 00:00:00;at least 40 mins. I went ;Bright flickering light in southwestern sky. There was a single bright light that was in the area to the southwest. To the naked eye, it had no shape, and appeared to be a flickering white. However, after looking at it with binoculars, it appeared to be triangular in shape and clearly change colors (quickly enough to make it appear white). I first noticed it around midnight, and watched it move all over the southwestern sky until I went to bed around twelve fourty. The observation occured on the northeastern end of the city, almost to the foothills of Roxy Ann. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness observed a celestial body, a star or a planet, but we are not certain.  The object could not have been Venus, which sets earlier in the evening, and it could not have been the star, Sirius, which would be in the southern sky at the hour, and on the date, indicated.  The witness might have been looking at Jupiter or Saturn, but that is a guess.  PD));42.2893859767878;-122.896319148942
A triangular set of three dim or orange lights were seen moving very fast and silently across the night sky over Medford, Oregon.;2007-09-11 21:40:00;5 to 6 seconds;A triangular set of three dim or orange lights were seen moving very fast and silently across the night sky over Medford, Oregon. On the night of Sept. 11, 2007 myself, my son and his girlfriend were looking in the sky. At approximately 9:40 pm a triangular shape of three lights appeared directly overhead going from north to south traveling very fast and without a sound. It seemed to come into view not quite over head like a satellite does when it come out of the shadow of the Earth from the sun, but then continued consistent until it went behind the neighborâ€™s tree line. It lasted about a five to six second count. The lights were not bright. They were dim or orange in color.;42.2893859767878;-122.896319148942
I saw a triangle shaped object in the sky above my back yard in Oregon.;2009-07-01 15:30:00;est. 2 seconds;I saw a triangle shaped object in the sky above my back yard in Oregon. I was in my back yard playing with my dogs around the beginning of July of 2009, it was roughly 15:30 hours. All of a sudden out of the corner of my view something irregular caught my eye. I turned to look at it, and saw what appeared to be a triangle of white dots. The sky was clear, with few clouds around. I scanned the sky for just a second or two, and by the time I returned my focus to where the object had just been, it was gone. This incident has stuck with me ever since, and even though I saw the object for just a second or two, I can still picture it perfectly in my mind. The object as stated before was in the shape of a triangle. The three white dots were connected by faint white smoky/whispy lines which converged at the center of the object. In the short moment that I saw the object, I didn't see it fly or move at all. It was stationary when it caught my attention, and seconds later it was just gone. After it had disappeared, I could see no smoke trails indicating where it had gone, nor did I hear any sounds indicative of a fast moving aircraft. I recently saw a television program where I saw a filmed sighting of a remarkably similar object, which was filmed in California. After seeing this, I decided that I should document my sighting. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));42.2893859767878;-122.896319148942
looking North we saw a triangle shaped object in the sky, rapidly changing colors from blue, red, green and white, almost looked like i;2010-08-11 23:00:00;15 minutes;looking North we saw a triangle shaped object in the sky, rapidly changing colors from blue, red, green and white, almost looked like it was spinning, at first thought it was some aircraft, but I have never seen a plane that big and bright before.  Then it started moving to the left (west) just a little, stop, move some more to the left.  It wasn't a type of movement that any aircraft would make.  It kept moving left in weird jerky movement, until it had moved behind a tree and we could no longer see.  Later farther west we saw something similar, but it was smaller, and this time it was moving right, but slower.;42.2893859767878;-122.896319148942
