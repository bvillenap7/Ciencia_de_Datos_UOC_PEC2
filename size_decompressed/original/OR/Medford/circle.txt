Huge, round, white light hovering over freeway overpass;1998-07-15 21:00:00;30 seconds;Huge, round, white light hovering over freeway overpass I was traveling south on an I-5 freeway overpass through the downtown area of Medford.  There was a huge circular white light above me to the left, not too high above the treetops which lined the side of the freeway.  It appeared to be the round, flat, glowing white bottom of an object, and I could not see the shape of it above the bottom surface.  It was just sitting in the sky, unmoving, unblinking.  I estimated it to be the size of a football field, large enough to hold a neighborhood of houses.  There weren't many cars on the freeway, and they, like I, were continuing down the freeway, unable to stop.  I don't know if anyone else saw it, and because of my rate of speed, it disappeared out of my view quickly.  It certainly could have been there longer than 30 seconds, but I could not look back because of traveling on the freeway, and could not stop because there is no shoulder on the overpass.

While looking East/South East out of our window, my wife and I saw a strobing round light in the sky.  It appeared to be changing colors so I retreived a pair of binoculars and again looked towards the object. Once in view it was clearly changing colors from red to blue to yellow to green and then repeating very fast.  We we're both (my wife and I) able to witness this happen.  It then begain strobing in the pattern of what appeared to be a cross consisting of five (5) round dots.  This went on for awhile and then it returned to the multi-color flashing pattern.  It appeared to move in a Southernly direction very slowly and at one point we lost sight of it for approximately 3 minutes and then it reappeared approximately 5 degrees to the North.   The entire incident lasted approximatly 30-45 minute. ((NUFORC Note:  Probable sighting of star, Sirius.

Circular craft 600-1000' off the ground and would shoot up to the elev. of most high flying planes within seconds. ((no contact info.));2017-03-20 22:10:00;45;Circular craft, 600-1000 ft off the ground, and would shoot up to the elevation of most high flying planes within a few seconds.   At the closest it was only about 3 blocks away.  Alternating colors of blue and red and would occasionally turn ultra violet of maybe had camouflage.  It was twice the size of a jet and could accelerate at inconceivable rates and stop on a dime and hover for several minutes.   It finally left by shooting off into the distance in just an instant, disappearing on the horizon. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of the report provides no contact information.

Orange pulsating lights in a square formation to a straight line formation;2021-05-15 21:00:00;35 minutes;Orange pulsating lights in a square formation to a straight line formation I have video of the objects.  I was in the living room watching TV with my grandsons when my cat came running into my living room from the outside dog door. She kept looking around the corner to see if something followed her inside.  I went to see what she was scared of thinking it was another cat. I turned on my porch light and scanned my backyard.  I saw a plane coming in from the southeast which is not their normal flight for landing at our airport. For some reason I looked in the southeast and saw orange pulsating lights in a square formation. I yelled at my grandsons to bring me my phone he was standing next to me with his. I then saw them go into a triangle formation then into a straight line. I then Started recording all the while trying to get my roommate outside to see what was going on. One by one they changed formation and then seemed to disappear, then when they had all but gone a larger red pulsating object came up over the trees.  It kept ascen! ding up until it disappeared.;42.2893859767878;-122.896319148942
