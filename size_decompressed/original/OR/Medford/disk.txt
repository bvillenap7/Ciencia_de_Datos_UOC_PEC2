Inflight formation with two disk;1978-03-21 04:00:00;7 or 8 mins;Inflight formation with two disk I'm currently a 25,000 hour pilot (2009), but on March 21, 1978 I only had around 5,000 hours.  I have reported this incident to Dr Haines and Dr. Friedman, no one else. I was flying an Aero Commander 680, on a the last leg of the day on a freight run from Klamath Falls, OR to Medford, OR at about 4am.  I had climbed to an altitude of 15,000 feet on this night in order to top icing conditions resulting from a fast moving cold front that was at that time about half way between the two cities.  I had a passenger with me sitting in the copilots seat. About 15 miles from the Medford VOR, I broke out the side of clouds into a perfectly clear rain washed sky, with full moon setting on the horizon ahead.  This of course, left me very high for landing at Medford...so I canceled my IFR flight plan and headed directly to the airport, arriving there at an altitude above 8,000 feet where I began circling to descend for the traffic pattern. As I was passing about 7,000 feet, I was circling to the left over the airport on a southeasterly heading when I noticed what looked to me like the landing light of a relatively slow moving aircraft flying in the opposite direction.  I called the tower and asked if they had other traffic in the area, they said they did not, I was not too surprised to hear that in as much as we were both above the towers airspace so contact was not required.  As we passed abeam each other at about the same altitude and within about one mile, the craft silhouetted against the full moon on the western horizon, when I could see that the craft had no tail and a light on the back as bright as the one on the front that I originally thought was a landing light.  Thinking this was unusual, I turned toward the craft, to the right.  As I turned the craft, also turned to the right and accelerated.  When I started the turn, I was southeast bound, as I turned steeper and steeper to keep the craft in sight, it continued to accelerate in a turning arc about 2 miles out side my turn until I lost sight of it over the top of the aircraft, then in about a 60 degree banked turn then headed to the northeast.  I continued the turn all the way around to a northwesterly heading when I rolled out, not having caught sight of the craft again in the turn. Shortly after rolling out of the turn heading to the northwest....two flying disc pulled up on my left wing, no more than ten feet off my wing tip and perhaps 5 feet higher, where we flew together in formation for perhaps 15 to 20 seconds.  The furthest one was lit slightly ahead of the nearest one which was not lit.  The lights of the city were shining up from the ground in the rain washed air.  I could not see much detail on the lighted craft due to the bright lights on the front and back, but I could see good detail on the nearer one, both craft appeared to be the same.  They were disc shaped, white or light gray in color and I could see what looked like scotch marks on the bottom. The were about the same diameter as the wing span of the Aero Commander or about 55 to 60 feet across.  I could not see any openings of any kind in either of the craft and could not hear any sounds from the craft over the sound of the planes engines. At the time I was flying at about 160 knots, after the 15 or 20 seconds of formation flying the two craft accelerated to about 190 knots and pulled out in front of us about 2 miles when they instantaneously accelerated to a streak of light heading into space.  I looked over to my passenger, who was a little white in color....I'm not sure if he was sick from the high G turn or stunned at what we has just witnessed.  After we landed it took a couple of minutes to get him out of the plane.  I saw him about 5 years later, he still did not wish to talk about it.  As this was occurring I was telling the tower these events as they happened, who never did see the craft....I can not understand why.;42.2893859767878;-122.896319148942
A metallic disc  with a brilliant amber colored light passed directly overhead at incredible speed at low altitude.;1995-06-30 15:00:00;3-4 seconds;A metallic disc  with a brilliant amber colored light passed directly overhead at incredible speed at low altitude. It was mid-afternoon on a clear, sunny day in the mid 1990s. My kids were in the front yard talking to my in-laws who had stopped by to visit.  I walked to the curb to bring the trash cans back up to the house and noticed a brilliant amber colored light low on the horizon over Mt. Ashland coming directly toward me at an incredible rate of speed.  It looked like a huge fireball in the sky and I was scared that it was a meteor about to hit.  It only took a couple of seconds to reach us and I was shocked when I looked up to see a round metallic object streaking by directly overhead at a low altitude. (It was about the size of a tennis ball held at arms length from my perspective) There was no contrail or fiery tail and it made absolutely no sound at all.  The light source must have come from the top of the craft because there was no light coming from underneath. I watched as it streaked by and disappeared from view within a second or two. It went from one horizon to the other in the span of about 3 to 4 seconds. I asked my in-laws if they had seen it and they said they hadn’t been looking at the sky and hadn’t noticed anything.  I had never believed in UFOs and was a bit shaken by the encounter. I listened to the news that night hoping for a logical explanation to what I had seen, but there was no mention of anything at all. Out of fear of sounding like a kook, I’ve kept the incident pretty much to myself all these years, but I’ve never been able to get it out of my mind.

Object seen over Medford, Oregon;2006-03-02 09:00:00;2 minutes +\-;Object seen over Medford, Oregon Witnessed a darl colored, round object at roughly 50,000 feet altitude, traveling south at a speed of approximately 500-600 Knots. Object was headed south when first observedbut, performed a high speed, high G turn and altered heading to south-southwest and continued flying in that direction until obscured by a buildings roofline. Around 2 minutes later a commercial airliner passed through same area as the UFO (route is well traveled from Portland to San Francisco. I have over five years experience in the navy as a radar operator and 20 years experience as a merchant marine captain and can state that this object did not perform like a jet aircraft would. UFO's turn would have been impossible for any aircraft currently in US inventory. It was a rounded, 90 degree turn at a speed of 500 knots plus that took perhaps 4 seconds total. It left no vapor trail, even though the aircraft that went through same area moments later did leave one.Object appeared much smaller than any aircraft normally flying at that height, roughly 1/10th the size of the airliner that was nearby.;42.2893859767878;-122.896319148942
Large multicolored disk radiating many colors w/ long hanging arms hovering over an hour above Griffin/Sterling Creek area.;2014-03-18 23:44:00;1 hour, 11 minutes;Large multicolored disk radiating many colors w/ long hanging arms hovering over an hour above Griffin/Sterling Creek area. ~150'+ wide x 30' tall disk w/ dome in center, top and bottom.  The glowing/flashing colors seemed to originate from the bottom dome, radiating out from the center to the rim of the disk and around its circumference.  Along the disks edge it only showed as blue/green were as the center blurred all colors of the rainbow.  Long 100' arms hung below and in front, curling and extending, moving like long worms and coiling like a snake, only visible by the radiating lights from the bottom of the disk. It mostly sat over the Griffin/Sterling Creek area and no higher than Anderson Butte (~1/2 mile+ elevation above valley floor). When it moved, it didn't seem like it was moving, but would suddenly appear closer/farther.  Would occasionally wobble on its axis, giving a better view of the disk's full shape.  Eventually drifted low and closer to the mountains, out of my view. Woke up my mother to witness.  When both of our eyes had adjust well to the lighting, we both could clearly make out the legs/arms extending out from the bottom/center of the disk.   Also, awoke two friends by phone who both watched from their houses.  Confirming location, movement, size, color, duration.  But angles, light, fatigue and eye sight caused my mother and I to have the best view. The legs are still freaking me out.;42.2893859767878;-122.896319148942

It also made a sound like a trumpet type sound with weird eerie effects to the sound.  My witnesses are me and 2 other dutch bros employees.;42.2893859767878;-122.896319148942
