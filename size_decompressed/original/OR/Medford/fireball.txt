My two boys and I were camping up on Anderson Butte,   just outside of Medford Oregon.    My boys and I were setting up camp.    All of us had gone inside to get our beds ready.     All of  a sudden the inside of the camper started to light up.    It was a white almost blinding light.    We all  jumped out of the camper to see what was going on.     While getting out of the camper  we could see something in the sky.   It was coming out of the northeast.   A large bright ball of light was coming towards us  high in the sky.    It seemed as if small part  were falling off as it passed overhead.    In addition,   as it passed over us,    it lit up the whole mountain side just  as if it was daylight.    After it had passed overhead,    going southwest,  it disappeared over the mountain top.   We did not hear any kind of noise when it passing overhead.  It  seemed as if it had ( landed / crashed) on the other side of the mountains from us,   or at least part of it did.    We did try and look for it,    but could not find anything. We called down into town on our CB radio and had people say that they had seen it to.  They told us the the news had said it was just a meteor and that it had landed off the coast of Calif.   We also heard people say it was suppost to be a rocket that had taken off from southern Calif. and crashed in the sea.  However ,  approx. one week later,    at about 10pm, we spotted lights on the mountain side.     The lights were white and appeared to float around as if they were looking for something.    We thought it might be a car/truck at first,    but we could see car lights in other parts of the mountains.    The car lights shifted around as they drove on the dirt roads.    They had two headlights that move togather.    These lights were three seperate lights that did not move togather.     They moved in random order,     in straight lines.    They were flying in the same location we saw the meteor / rocket go down.     We watched the three lights fly around for approx. 20 to25 min.  after that,     they flew up above the mountains and straight away from us until they disappeared.;42.2893859767878;-122.896319148942
Fire ball inferno on opposing valley wall.  Then vanished.;2015-08-15 23:30:00;2 minutes;Fire ball inferno on opposing valley wall.  Then vanished. I live in a town that sits in the middle of a valley Rogue Valley.  As I was driving to work along a outskirt road that looks over the valley, on the opposite side of the valley I saw huge flames looking like they where approx. 50-75 feet high, and about 50 feet long, along the ridge line of the opposing valley wall.  I watched this inferno looking/fire ball/flames, for about a minute while driving until I turned off the road and the tree line obstructed my view from the fire. I was extremely puzzled by what I saw, here in Oregon we had a few forest fires at that time around the area but none that could be seen from inside the rogue valleyfloor.  I kept driving for a couple minutes and decided to make a u-turn, head back to try and see this again. Turning back onto the road foothills rd. where I witnessed the flames, proceeding back the same way I came from, looking for the flames, which I can best describe as looking like a raging forest fire that was lighting up the night sky with an orange aura, like a fire does.  It was completely gone with not a trace or evidence that anything out of the normal was there only a few minutes a ago.   I parked my car, pulled off onto the side of the road where I believed I had the best vantage point when I witnessing the flames and got out, turned my car off and sat on the roof for 10 minutes hoping I could get a clue as to what I saw.  Nothing.  It had vanished.   What I witnessed was enormous, and has baffled me if it was a forest fire, as raging of an inferno it looked like it was.  50-75 feet tall.  Could of just disappeared in a matter of minutes?  It was not a forest fire but something else.;42.2893859767878;-122.896319148942
