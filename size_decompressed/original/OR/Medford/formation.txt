20 lights in formation across sky.  ((Starlink satellites??));2020-02-24 06:00:00;5 minutes;20 lights in formation across sky What I thought was the space station (very slow bright light across sky) turned out to be about 20 evenly-spaced lights, travelling in formation, faster than an aircraft but not as fast as a shooting star (as a shooting star passed in the other direction as I was looking up).  Looking at other comments, this may be Starlink satellites?;42.2893859767878;-122.896319148942
A line of about 100 small lights traversed the sky in a single line and headed east.  ((Starlink satellites??));2021-05-27 21:00:00;10 sec;A line of about 100 small lights traversed the sky in a single line and headed east Saw a line of multiple small lights in a line following eachother....going east directly over the town of medford oregon. Moving faster than a plane slower than a jet. They traversed the sky and continued east over the cascade mt range.;42.2893859767878;-122.896319148942
