While in flight landing at Medford from Klammath Falls, I spoted what appeared to be another aircraft flying the opposite direction.  S;1979-03-01 04:00:00;5 min;Summary : While in flight landing at Medford from Klammath Falls, I spoted what appeared to be another aircraft flying the opposite direction.  Since the moon was setting, when this craft siluetted againt the moon, I could see it had no tail.  I turned toward the craft, it turned toward me.  The encounter ended with the craft flying formation with me for about 30 seconds, where I could see much detail of two craft. This encounter may be too old to be of interest to you.  I did report it to a Universite the day after, but I do not remember which University.  I got the phone number from the Medford Police for the University.  About 4 years ago I reported the encounter to Dr. Haynes.  I only mention it to you now, because I still have relatives in Medford, who sent me a newspaper clipping of a recent sighting there, that mentions the name of your organization.  If you have an interest in more detail, let me know, I will email you a full description. Russ Smith;42.2893859767878;-122.896319148942
Fast moving object disappears into night sky;2004-02-03 03:05:00;3 minutes;Fast moving object disappears into night sky I am a Commercial pilot and was on the ground at the Medford (MFR) Oreogn airport at 3:00 am waiting for transportation.  I looked into the clear sky to the north over towards the Rogue Valley VOR (navigation facility)and saw an aircraft, estimated at 10,000 feet, manuvering at very different angles of turns, circles, and other zig-zag patterns.  The aircraft had a red/orange tint with no flashing lights or strobe lights.  This seemed very odd.  I thought for sure it was an F-16 from the K.Falls base doing some fooling around.  I looked for another plane in trail(most travel in pairs), but their was nothing else.  All of the sudden, the aircraft started climbing straight up and disappeared into the night sky.  I watched it as long as my eyes could see it.  It never returned as I stood on the ramp looking for about an additional ten minutes.  There was no noise.  I have never seen an aircraft move as quickly as this one.  I departed the airport and contacted Seattle Center for my clearance.  I asked them if they had any traffic on radar over the last 15-20 minutes in the vicinity of MFR.  They said no.  I asked him if there had been any military traffic.  Again the answer was no.  I think I may of seen my first UFO.;42.2893859767878;-122.896319148942
Changing color, rotating lights with a hazy, v-shaped short light beam beneath.;2007-10-23 20:30:00;5 minutes;Changing color, rotating lights with a hazy, v-shaped short light beam beneath. Around 8:30pm last night I was sitting on my back patio with my dogs.  What immediately caught my eye was a completely still, lighted object in the sky.  I went through the usual eliminations star, airplane, helicopter, weather balloon.  None of these fit what I was seeing. I started focusing on the object not as a whole, but in parts-trying to make sense of what I was seeing.  First were lights going from left to right.  There had been some red when I thought it was a plane.  The lights I was now seeing were white.  I couldn’t make out the shape of the object these lights were coming from.  Then within the sequence of white lights, a red one was included.  I almost missed that one as I had started my focus on the beam below. The beam below was as wide as the lights that were going from left to right, narrowing down to a point in a “v” shape and ended not far below the lighted object.  This light was a foggy white color. When I looked back at the lights to make sure my eyes weren’t playing tricks on me, I green light was included in the white ones going from left to right.  It was then that I knew I was seeing something I had never  seen before and I needed to report this to someone.;42.2893859767878;-122.896319148942
Orange-red ball of light with jerky movements going North, then South, then West and vanishing over the skies of Medford, OR.;2011-12-31 19:30:00;5 minutes;Orange-red ball of light with jerky movements going North, then South, then West and vanishing over the skies of Medford, OR. Orangish ball of light. Moved North, then South, then West. Lasted about 5 minutes and maybe less. After it moved about, it just disappeared. I've never seen anything like it.  Definitely was not an airplane or a helicopter or a satellite or even a meteor or an asteroid  I know because it's movements were too jerky and random to be anything like that.  After the jerky movements, it just vanished. There was no explosion or anything like that.  Just vanished.  The sighting was not extremely close to earth.  It was relatively high in the sky, however was not so small to be a star or planet but it was not close enough for me to distinctly make out its features and there was a sort of haze around it.;42.2893859767878;-122.896319148942
Sighting that seemed to be red balloons but was clearly not due to the spacing of the orbs? and behavior.;2013-01-09 18:00:00;2 minutes;a siting that seemed to be red balloons but was clearly not due to the spacing of the orbs? and behavior we observed prox 15 orbs?  they were red in color,they were at a elevation angle of prox 30 degrees. they were traveling north to south, they maintained  equal spacing to each other except when they faded from view at which time they seperated and changed to a ninety degree angle with respect to the ground. ( A SORT OF SWOOPING UPSHIFT)  An estimate is that they were at a distance of 2 miles from the viewers.  At this distance they appeared to be prox two times the size of a star of medium brightness.  They were at an altitude of approx 500 to 1000ft.  they were headed due south ,when they separated from the prior regular distancing pattern,they seemed to converge on a common spot in the cloud cover.  the weather conditions were heavy clouds at prox 1000ft.no est secured as of yet of the prevailing winds speed or direction.   the siting was made with a large hill in the background which has a height of prox 1000ft.;42.2893859767878;-122.896319148942
Large bright object coming in fast, then vanishes.;2014-12-18 23:11:00;1 second;Large bright object coming in fast, then vanishes. It was a flash of white light, that's all, that lasted only a moment.  I believe it was quite large because my first thought was that it was a meteor, the biggest I've ever seen, and that it was coming in all the way.  Frankly my main thought was, Oh, ((deleted))!  But then it blinked out, vanished, with no trace.  No fragments, no explosion, nothing.  This may have been something natural, unnatural, who knows?  I only wanted a record of it in case it was significant in some way, to somebody else.  Thank You. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
