I was driving down a rural road in Medford, Oregon when I noticed 2 lights in the sky ahead of me.  It is a very clear night. I pulled over to see what they were.   One was obviously a plane with a blinking light on it.  The other one however was a what seemed to be a sort of cone shaped thing with one white light on the bottom and a strip of lights on the top part of it that would change colors from red, blue, green, and yellow. The plane flew near it and then the object changed direction and flew over me (west to east) until it was out of sight. The plane then flew in the opposite direction and then away from me (north). The strange object seemed to be much bigger than the plane.;42.2893859767878;-122.896319148942
((HOAX??))  UFO's in Medford Oregon on April 9th 2014.;2014-04-09 22:35:00;1 hour;UFO's in Medford Oregon on April 9th, 2014. Saw multiple cone shaped objects flying, hovering and moving in strange and horizontal ways I've never seen before.  Very sudden and jerky movements!   Saw 2 different objects not much later that were extremely bright in color and flying extremely fast in strange patterns and then disappear.   Last thing we saw was about an hour later where the sky lit up a very bright blue almost like a lightning strike.;42.2893859767878;-122.896319148942
