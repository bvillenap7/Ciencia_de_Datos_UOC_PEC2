Cigar shaped object viewed through binoculars over Medford;2008-09-09 18:35:00;4 minutes;Cigar shaped object viewed through binoculars over Medford At about 6:35 pm on Tuesday September 9, 2008, I was on the back balcony of my apartment when I noticed an object flying up high in the sky, traveling from south to north. My first thought was that the object was a airliner, however the speed of the object seemed slower than usual and there was no visible vapor trail, even though there were a few light clouds in the upper atmosphere.  I ran inside and grabbed a pair of binoculars and continued to observe the object. The binoculars are 10x50 and through them the object appeared to a little over 1/4 of an inch in size. The object was reflecting light from the setting sun, which highlighted certain details. It was cigar shaped and displayed no wings, tail or visible lights. The object appeared to be metallic and was bright white in color along most of its surface with a hint of red towards the rear. There seemed to be three large circular impressions that ran along the length of object. There was no discernible propulsion that could be seen.  I watched it though the binoculars for about two and half minutes before it flew out of my field of vision.;42.2893859767878;-122.896319148942
