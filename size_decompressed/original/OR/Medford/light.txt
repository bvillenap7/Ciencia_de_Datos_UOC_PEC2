Projecting-retracting-light beam from no visible source;1972-07-15 22:00:00;ten minutes;Projecting-retracting-light beam from no visible source Traveling south towards the foothills to see my Girlfriend when I noticed a light against the silouetted mountain. At first I thought it was someones spotlight, but suddenly realized that it was much larger as it broke into a beam of light projecting down into the city. I pulled over and got out to see what the heck this was all about and it was absolutely silent. No sound from the City, no barking dogs, not any noise. It was wierd, so quiet. I thought what can that be? Is it a large light that the carnivals used to use to shine a light beam up into the sky to attract people? As I studied this light, it rose above the horizon of the mountain top and I could see stars below it, so I know it was not a land based object. After a few minutes, it receded back to itself and vanished. All that remained in that location of the nite sky was a bit of fog looking stuff which slowly disipated. At that moment, all sound returned. The sounds of the city and freeway traffic far off, and closer was dog barking, lots of dogs barking all around at all the homesites in the foothills. The hair on my arms stood up and I chilled all over. After thinking more about what I saw, I realized that the size of that object was huge and the beam of light did not simply turn on and off, but projected (visually extended and retracted like a telescope ). Certainly not the speed of light. I am reporting this because I just ran across your site for the first time and never knew there was a place to report the incidence. I am having chill bumps just reliving the experience. What ever that thing was, it controlled sound and was silent itself.The light beam that it projected was a different light than I have ever seen, it was thick and intensly luminous even though it source had to have been at least two or more miles away. I observed it from a side view, it never shone on me, but I could see what it was illuminating at a great distance. Thanks for a place to finally tell of my encounter after 30 years.

The hovering spotlight simply went out and disappeared completely;2002-10-14 19:05:00;5 min.;The hovering spotlight simply went out and disappeared completely My roommate and I were exiting off I-5 onto Crater Lake Hwy at dusk when we saw a bright spotlight hovering slightly up and down just a few hundred feet off the ground with no sound. Medford is in a valley and the light was below the hilltop line. We've both been in the military and we know it wasn't a helicopter or balloon or fireworks. After a few minutes, the very bright spotlight went out extremely suddently and there was nothing left in the sky. It was simply gone.;42.2893859767878;-122.896319148942

Green/Blue Colored Lights fall from the sky in same location nearly twice a week around same time.;2007-03-15 21:30:00;5 sec;Green/Blue Colored Lights fall from the sky in same location nearly twice a week around same time. Me and my wife go for cruises everynight around 9-10 o'clock at night. Lately, we have been seeing this strange orb of light that falls from the same compass direction around the same time of day once or twice a week. The object starts its appearance at about a 45* angle from the NE horizon, and goes verticly down and passes the mountains out of site. The object leaves a trail and a haze, plus it changes from the color blue to green. We have noticed this since Feb. This year, 2007.

Bright white-blue light in the sky, the light moved, no sound, no other light. Object changed color, speed, and course quickly.;2008-05-05 05:00:00;3 minutes;Bright white-blue light in the sky, the light moved, no sound, no other light.  Object changed color, speed, and course quickly. I was leaving my front porch for a walk this morning, it was dark, and I noticed a bright light behind me. This light was not usual for the time of morning.   At first I thought it was the moon because of the purity of the light, but the moon is not in the west at 5 in the morning. I turned and saw what looked like an extremely bright star however, this star was moving from the southwest at a steady pace no faster than a jet-plane.  I watched the object move overhead and checked for running lights, flashing lights, and sounds. There were no colored lights besides the white-blue light, and no sound at any time.   When the object passed over me it light seemed to rotate from front to back and spin. As it spun it became brighter and cleaner to me.  Following the moving light, the object changed course.  It also changed from the white color to an orangish-pink color.  I realized what the object was once it passed over head, having seen one many years ago.  The shape, however, was different. The tear-shape was not exaggerated.  There was only one (I searched for others).  As far as my background, I and my father have had previous contact with a craft like this.  My father (who died last winter) has notes on his experiences on the Ore. Calif. border in the seventies, and my own occured near the same region. The same kind of light moved very fast from Mt. Shasta.  I have also seen one being chased by Military aircraft while on a hunting trip.  Do people who see UFOs often have more than one experience?   My father claimed he had a stand off with the light and took it very serious that is why I'm reporting this to you now.;42.2893859767878;-122.896319148942
Strange flashing whitish light that moved like a plane but then stopped and stood still for five minutes.;2009-08-24 14:30:00;7 minutes;Strange flashing whitish light that moved like a plane but then stopped and stood still for five minutes. My brother, mother and I were driving along North Phoenix Road North towards Medford.  We were in between Medford and Phoenix, perhaps the outskirts of Medford, around Campbell road, when I noticed a light flashing in the sky in front of us and a little to the right (East).  It was flashing in a strange way, so I pulled to the side of the road.  We got out and watched a UFO move steadily in our direction but somewhat to the East over the mountains.  At first I thought it might be a plane, but the entire craft was flashing, as I said, in a strange way. It was about 2:30 pm, so it was broad daylight, and the light needed to be fairly bright in order to flash that way.  The way that it was flashing gave me the impression that various parts of the craft were rotating.  The whitish light was continuously emanating from it, but in different intensities and from different parts of the craft.  So, the craft continued along and passed us, continuing South and a little East,! when it suddenly just stopped. I then knew definitely that it wasn't a plane.  It sat there stationary, and still flashing, for about five minutes.  We watched it for those five minutes until we had to go (we were late for something), so I have no idea how long it stayed in that position.;42.2893859767878;-122.896319148942

The stars we;2011-08-08 23:00:00;twenty five seconds;Me and my friend were laying in a grassy hill in Medford, Oregon.  We were on vacation, just counting bats and star-gazing.  The stars were almost all visible, and the warm summer breeze swireled below them.  As a third bat flittered close by, we were both completely calm and relaxed.  Then we saw it. I say it because I am still not positive what it was that we saw. Just a single light, much like the satelites that you some times see.  Or a plane, or helicopter.  But it was no satelite, was no plane or helicopter.  It was for sure a UFO (unidentified flying object), and possibly and extraterresterial flying space craft. All it was was a single light, and if looked just like a star.  But it was very faint, then grew brighter and brighter, until it was as bright as the clearest stars.  Then it started traveling around the sky, just a bit faster then a plane.  Much faster than a satelite.  It looped around the sky for roughly twenty five seconds, then eventually flew out of our sight.  It was no shooting star, for it moved around the sky much longer than one would.  It kept the same speed through out the whole time we watched it. I have provided as many details as I can think of.

Red light traveling at extreme speed.;2014-03-21 04:37:00;3 seconds;Red light traveling at extreme speed. I was sitting in my backyard in my hot tub with my headphones on, i was watching the sky to the north, at the right time i saw a point of red light, it was traveling in a straight line from east to west about 2/3 above the horizon,it looked like it could have three red points like a triangle, but it was hard to tell, as it was traveling about 4000 miles an hour, i am only estimating the speed because it took only 3 seconds to cross the sky, it did not skip on the atmosphere, it did not flicker, it stayed the same brightness and it was red, i believe it was a flying object, definately not a meteor.;42.2893859767878;-122.896319148942

Bright white light moving over Medford, OR moving east accelerated out of site and disappeared as it approached a plane.;2014-12-23 18:00:00;2 minutes;Bright white light moving over Medford, OR moving east accelerated out of site and disappeared as it approached a plane. Looking north from Medford at 6:00pm I saw a bright white light moving east at about 5000 feet in altitude with no visible navigation lights.  As I watched it, a plane heading in a westerly direction at about the same altitude appeared to be getting close to the object.   The white light slightly changed course and accelerated up at about a 20 degree angle from its previous trajectory as it changed color from white to orange and very quickly faded away in intensity as it disappeared.;42.2893859767878;-122.896319148942
About 40 star-like lights traveling in a fixed trajectory.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-17 21:30:00;30 minutes;About 40 star-like lights traveling in a fixed trajectory My eight and twelve year old girls were camping out in the backyard and saw multiple lights all headed in the same direction. They called me outside and I observed probably fifteen or twenty of these lights traveling all in the same direction. They were headed slightly NorthEast from Medford, Oregon toward Klamath Falls area. They could have been planes but they weren’t blinking. They were traveling too slowly and steadily to be shooting stars. Once one shone a bright light twice in our direction, causing two large blinks. Most were traveling in the same path, but occasionally one would be going across the main path for a while. My husband and fifteen year old son also came out and observed for a while.;42.2893859767878;-122.896319148942
