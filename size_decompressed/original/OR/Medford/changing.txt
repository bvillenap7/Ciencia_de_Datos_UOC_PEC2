The ball traveled south over Medford and broke up into 3 and then 6 separate balls of orange/light and continued south toward Ashland. He said they were as high as the planes usually fly and did not appear to be coming down but kept flying at the same altitude the whole time he could see them.;42.2893859767878;-122.896319148942
Hovering multicolored object over Medford;2017-04-29 22:00:00;30 seconds;Hovering multicolored object over Medford Watching the meteor shower, I noticed an extremely, twinkly object in the Eastern sky.  I grabbed my binoculars to get a closer look and saw an object that I thought was stationary until it moved.  It was changing colors red, blue, green, purple, yellow and orange but in no pattern that I noticed.  I went to get my kids so they could view it but they were asleep.  As I watched it, it took off northbound.;42.2893859767878;-122.896319148942

I saw a blue glowing object as I was photographing the moon in zoom mode on my Iphone camera.  The object appeared as different shapes at different times.  I took 9 photos of it.  Initially, it appeared to have a cloudy shape - appearing to look like a sea turtle with a tail.   Then, when the cloudiness disappeared, it looked similar to a bat-shape with a large body.  In the next photo it appears U shaped.   In the next photo it looks like a rocket.  Next it looks like a small fish shape.  Then as an airplane comes in for a landing at our airport, it looks T-shaped and as it suddenly reduces elevation, it looks like a flying saucer.  In the final photo as it came way down in elevation, it stopped seemingly nearby and it appears as a frog with only back legs.  In every photo it is the same glowing blue color.;42.2893859767878;-122.896319148942
