An extremely fast object of hazy chevron shape from one horizon to the other in a minute's time.  ((NUFORC Note:  Satellite??  PD));2006-10-30 19:10:00;1 minute;An extremely fast object of hazy chevron shape from one horizon to the other in a minute's time. I took my dog out to do her business, and I looked up and saw what I thought at first was a satellite flying across the sky, but then realized I had never seen one go from one horizon to the other in a minute's time.  As I watched it, it had a central dim lightsource with luminous fog-like emanations possibly smaller lights in a web like pattern coming from the center outward in the shape of a chevron.
