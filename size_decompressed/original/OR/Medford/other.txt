UFO Landing in Medford, OR.;2012-09-15 02:15:00;30 minutes;UFO Landing in Medford, OR. At 2:15 AM, 3 objects seen above a field across from an apartment complex on Hwy 99. First object at first a large white orb of light emitting two light blue colored beams of light.  Other objects dirigible in shape with lights changing from red and green to blue and magenta in a pulsating fashion. 5 minutes later, first object begins landing process, as it gets closer to the ground, true shape is revealed to be a disk 25 feet in diameter, jet black in color, with cube shaped constructs on top of it. 3 minutes later, alien craft lands on the ground, with the 2 other objects orbiting above it. 2 minutes later, at 2:25 AM, I rushed across the highway to observe the craft up close.  At 2:30 AM, began to slowly move towards the craft, and one minute later, came into physical contact with the craft. Surface of the craft is smooth and metallic to the touch with no scratch marks or indentations on it.  No hieroglyphics or symbols on the surface as well. White light se! en beneath the craft. 2 other craft still seen orbiting above the main craft. After 12 minutes of studying the landed craft, the craft began making a humming noise, possibly signaling the start of the launch.  Craft lifts up 20 feet into the air, shining the two beams of light, operating them somewhat like searchlights.  Light beams move around in sweeping motion until one of the lights converges on me followed by the other.  Lights focused on me for 30 seconds, then turned off.  The main craft floats up to the 2 other craft and at 2:45 AM, all 3 craft fly off to the Northeast at a fast speed. Later returned to my apartment.;42.2893859767878;-122.896319148942
2 UFO’s flying in southern Oregon.;2019-08-31 09:20:00;20 minutes;2 UFO’s flying in southern Oregon. I was letting my dogs out in my backyard when I looked up and saw two things in the sky.  One looked blue and another look like a star.  I thought they were stars, but I then saw them move.  The blue one moved a little, then the star one moved to the other side of the blue one.  The star one moved farther and farther away from the blue one toward the sun.  They moved in all directions, so I knew it couldn’t have been a plane.   I thought I also saw a red dog in the sky as well, which the star UFO looked like it went to it.  They were pretty high up in the sky.  There were two planes that passed in between them, so they must have not been low enough for them to see.  I tried to show my wife, but she couldn’t see them.  They were not right over Medford, but closer to Mt. McLoughlin/Crater Lake National Park area, maybe farther, but in that direction.  They probably looked like stars because the sun was out.;42.2893859767878;-122.896319148942
