Sitting in my living room something caught my attention outside, when I looked out into the night sky I saw a large very sphere of bright white light in the Southwestern sky.   IT was coming down at a moderate rate of speed.   No tail or fire ball following the object.  It was moving south to north and eventually went behind the coastal mountain range.;42.2893859767878;-122.896319148942
Ball of light crosses Southern Ore sky;2012-06-28 05:57:00;45 sec;Ball of light crosses Southern Ore sky i was sitting in my hot tub in my backyard at approx 0557am on 6/28 in medford,or.the sky was still very dark even those it was early am,traveling from the sw corner of the sky going in a diagonal direction going to the ne,I see s very bright round object in the sky,i was looking for the usual plane running lights or listening for a sound,i heard none.the light didn't seem to blink at all,but it seemed to flicker slightly with its brightness The object traveled at a slow plane speed like a cesna.,not the speed of a commercial jet,and it didn't appear to be high enough to be in orbit like a satalite and the fact that i picked up the light with my ipod touch 4th generation,proofs it was quite bright,because that cameras doesn't have the best resolution.i caught 45 seconds of video of this object,and then i stopped it,so i could walk across my yard because it was about to go over my house,and i didn't want the video to look awkward while i was walking,but when ! i walked around it was gone,and their was plenty of sky for miles that i can see,it was no where.;42.2893859767878;-122.896319148942
