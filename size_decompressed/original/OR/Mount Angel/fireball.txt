6 reddish orange lights moving slowly over Mount Angel Oregon;2013-07-04 22:15:00;15 minutes;6 reddish orange lights moving slowly over Mount Angel Oregon After the town fireworks display, my fiancé and I made our way home.  I had just walked inside when she called in and said there is something unusual outside that I should see.  I quickly made my way out and we both beheld two small, fiery looking, reddish orange lights in the sky, progressing slowly from the north to the south.  As they traveled in the sky at about a 2 o’clock position toward the east from our position, their speed did not noticeably vary, nor did their distance from one another.  From our vantage point they appeared about 4-6 times the size of a large star.  There was no noise associated with their movement, and their lights did not flicker, blink, or change color.  As they progressed south, both lights rather swiftly and almost simultaneously faded out.  They did not visibly travel beyond the horizon or behind some object. Almost immediately after the first two disappeared, two more arose or appeared from the same spot toward the northern horizon, and began drifting at the same speed and route as the first two.  They looked nearly identical to the first two and traveled at about the same speed, and were otherwise indistinguishable from the first pair.  Once these disappeared as the first two, two new objects appeared just as the first two sets and proceeded in all manners as those first two sets until they too disappeared in the same way. Given the duration of the events, the clear view we had, and that we were naturally looking into the sky because the town’s 4th of July fireworks display had just ended, we presumed that many other people had seen this sight too.
