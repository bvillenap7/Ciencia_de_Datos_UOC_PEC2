Hovering craft with flashing red, green, and blue lights.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Sirius, or one of the planets??  PD));2012-02-03 19:00:00;2 hr 30 min;Hovering craft with flashing red, green, and blue lights I was outside walking my dog at about 7:00 PM when I noticed something in the sky.  At first glance I thought it was an airplane, but I realized it wasnâ€™t moving, or making any noise.   I watched it for a few minutes and it stayed in the same spot.  It had blinking lights that flashed red, green, and blue.  It was moving very slightly up and down, but it did not change directions or move from the area.  Later that night at about 9:30 I went back outside only to see that it was gone, and there was a huge luminescent, glowing ring around the moon.

2 craft spotted, one with blinking red, green, and blue lights,  the other a reddish color;2012-02-04 19:00:00;4 hr 30 min;2 craft spotted, one with blinking red, green, and blue lights,  the other a reddish color I had just gotten home at about 7:00 and I noticed there was the same craft I had seen the night before in the sky.  It was in a slightly different area in the sky, but it still had the same flashing red, green, and blue lights as the night before.  It was still doing the same slow, hovering motion too.  I went back out about 4 hours later at about 11:00 and I saw that it had moved to the right to a different part of the sky.  I also noticed what looked like another craft in the opposite direction.  It did not have any blinking lights, but was a light reddish color.It was moving up and down slowly, just like the other craft.
