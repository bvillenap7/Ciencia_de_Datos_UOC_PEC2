I realized that it wasn't a flock but a grayish transparent chevron shape. In a matter of 5 seconds it flattened out into a cigar shape that was no wider than the original chevron shape. As it was flattening, 6 bright but tiny green lights appeared in a somewhat circular shape where the chevron shape had been (see drawing). They stayed this way for about 2 seconds before they began to converge into 1 green light. This single light was stationary and slowly dimmed for about 6 seconds. Then the green light flared up to a very bright green light, but did not change in size. I can only describe it like sunlight shining on greenish chrome. At this point the bright green light slowly began to move south. It picked up speed rapidly and continued south and had a thin green trail following it. I watched it speed away for about 3 seconds until I lost it in the distance.;44.7809000000001;-117.8267
