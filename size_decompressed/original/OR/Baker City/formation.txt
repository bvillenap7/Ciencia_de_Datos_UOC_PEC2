3 objects in triangular pattern traverse sky with pattern change occuring.;2002-08-12 02:43:00;8 minutes;3 objects in triangular pattern traverse sky with pattern change occuring. Saw 3 golden lights approaching from the SW. Were in a pattern with 2 up front and 1 in the rear ( a long triangle). As they flew past Cygnus they cut across the wing tip. All during the time they were approaching Cygnus, the right front object was gradually decelerating, it did this until it was even with the rear object. The triangle pattern had now reversed. The reversal took the entire time that it took these 3 objects to cover the sky.  They proceeded in the reversed pattern until I could no longer see them. I watched them with 7x50 binoculars, where they looked pretty bright. Without the binoculars they were very visible because of their brightness they apperaed to be as bright as gamma Aquila. They had no flashing lights, even in the binoculars, and did not wobble as satellights sometimes do. They also never appeared to drop in the sky, even as they travelled beyond the binocular range. It took nearly 9 minutes for them to traverse the sky from horizon to horizon! .  I was watching from a small city 10k population site with street lights...;44.7809000000001;-117.8267
I have never seen any thing like this and I use my binoculars several times a week.;2020-04-28 16:00:00;45 minutes;I have never seen any thing like this and I use my binoculars several times a week. Northeast of Baker City, Oregon and towards the Eagle Cap mountains (Wallowa Mountains) I was looking through my 10/50 binoculars at the mountains and spotted two objects in the sky.  One was long and horizontal and the second one was round. Both appeared to be stationary in a fixed position.  Also the distance between them never varied.  Occasionally the sun would reflect off of them.  After about a half hour cloud cover obscured them.  After about 5 minutes the clouds moved on and they were in the same position and the distance between them still remained constant.  When I first saw them I thought maybe a weather balloon but the shape was different and their position remained constant.  I have 20/20 vision and could not see them without the binoculars.  Finally after about 45 minutes high thin clouds obscured them again.  After the clouds moved on they had disappeared.;44.7809000000001;-117.8267
