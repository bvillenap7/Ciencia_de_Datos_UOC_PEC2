Lessons learned;2005-01-15 12:00:00;everyday;Lessons learned I am your 9/28/03 eastern oregon submitter. I Just wanted to drop a few thoughts on the subject after honestly having faced the fact that there are no rules or limits. I have spent a great deal of time looking up over the past year and will continue to sleep under the stars every once in a while but I refuse to let what I have seen absorb so much of my life. I have since had a cowardly object look my way on two seperate occassions. My opinion is that these objects move in a friction-less pathway(vacuum?)that is somehow created in an open environment. I can't help but feel like however and whatever is going on up there gives me a feeling of trouble on the horizon and short of grabbing a .50cal or whatever I can get my hands on and trying my best to get some or have my effect on their lives. I have decided to have faith and keep on keepin on. You really do get what you look for.-G.W.;44.7809000000001;-117.8267
