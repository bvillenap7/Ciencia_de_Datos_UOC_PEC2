12 V Shaped Lights in Sky;2006-08-19 21:26:00;10-15 seconds;12 V Shaped Lights in Sky I saw 12 lights in a perfect V shape, then two of the lights on the right side veered off to right leaving a light trail and disappeared, and that quickly all the rest of the lights disappeared without leaving a trail.  They just vanished.  I heard no sound from the lights.;44.7809000000001;-117.8267
