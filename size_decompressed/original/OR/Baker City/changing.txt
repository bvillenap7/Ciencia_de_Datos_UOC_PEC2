Flying orb over southwestern mountain range nightly in eastern Oregon.;2020-02-08 20:00:00;2 - 5 hours;Flying orb over southwestern mountain range nightly in eastern Oregon. From about 8:00pm untill around 11:00pm-1:00am, since early April 2019 through last night 2/8/20. Almost every night a very bright orb, that changes size and colors. Travels around the sky over our southwestern mountain range. At times it looks like a big light rotating or spinning in circles like a CD. And other times it glows likes a magnetic sphere, showing a variety of colors. It travels extremely fast, sometimes the size is enormous. Sometimes it gets as small as a basketball. I have multiple photos and videos from many different nights and times of year. It truly is magnificent!;44.7809000000001;-117.8267
