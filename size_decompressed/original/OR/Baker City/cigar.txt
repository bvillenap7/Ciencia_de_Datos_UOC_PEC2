Large, cigar-shaped craft w / windows travelling south to NNE near Baker, Oregon @ appx. 22:00 on March 24th, 1979.;1979-03-24 22:00:00;12 seconds;Large, cigar-shaped craft w / windows travelling south to NNE near Baker, Oregon @ appx. 22:00 on March 24th, 1979. Apparently very large,cigar-shaped craft w / large, rectangular observation windows. Looked like an airplane without wings , travelling south to NNE over Baker ( City ), Oregon the night of March 24th, 1979. After it passed north of town, seemed to slow down, make a 90*turn , and zoomed east at what seemed to be warp speed . A day or so later , the Oregonian newspaper ran an AP article out of San Francisco about a UFO seen over a bunch of western states by airline pilots. I am a forestry technician with the Bureau of Land Management with nearly 20 years of experience, and have lived in Baker City for the better part of 24 years .

Large wingless crafts are practicing for T-bone accident with passenger jet... or maybe just having a good time.;2005-06-02 12:00:00;5-10 seconds;Large wingless crafts are practicing for T-bone accident with passenger jet... or maybe just having a good time. Have witnessed this on two seperate occasions.  Both events took place around the same airspace and directly after commercial flight flies overhead southeast headed for Boise, ID.  Nothing out of the ordinary as far as the jetliners were concerned. (witnesses both using high quality optics)   After jet flys overhead  I would guess about a 1/2 mile behind there is what most certainly appears to be wingless cigar shaped (with pointed nose)aircraft dropping down to similiar altitude and flying at a 90 degree angle into the jets flight path.  These aircraft have larger than jets body size and a considerable amount of more speed (2-3 times). also leave a very heavy thick contrail when leveling out.  I would'nt put these craft in the same category as some other happenings I've witnessed but pretty cool nonetheless.My guess is man-made on these babys.   P.S.not sure whether or not flight was audible because of commercial jets racket. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD));44.7809000000001;-117.8267
