I was 18 year's old.  I and my girlfriend were at a friend's house.  It was about 11:00 PM when we noticed about 8 lights in the Northwest sky.  The lights were moving Southeast.  So my girlfriend and I proceeded to go to my Grandmother's house which was a few blocks away. The lights ended up stopping in The Southeastern sky.  We stood in the front yard of my Grandmother's house for awhile.  Where I began to try and speak to the lights using my mind.  I asked them saying I just want to know if you are really aliens?  My girlfriend and I then proceeded to move to the back yard.  I had a 35mm camera and 3 role's of film.  I shot pictures until the batteries went dead in the camera.  About 2:00 AM I started to see the sky get dark above us and I mean pitch black.  I remember looking up noticing the blackness. And then the next thing I remember it was about 5:00 AM just turning daylight.  And I was standing there with my eyes following a silver disc leaving the atmosphere.  There was about 3 hour's of missing time. That day we took the role's of film to be developed.  We picked them up and most of the pictures were just pure black. But we found a couple that had lights.  My girlfriend put them away. And we forgot about the encounter.  Somehow we were made to forget. Our memories had been tampered with. It was now the year 2013' sixteen year's later. And I stumbled upon the photograph's.  I took the 35mm print to our local drugstore. I used their Kodak picture maker machine.  Where I sized up the 35mm print to an 8×10.  I took the 8×10 and then scanned it into my computer. Where I was able to zoom in on the image. I have since then misplaced the Original 35mm print. Fortunately, I had the images saved on my computer.  The images that are attached are 100% authentic Extraterrestrial U.F.O. It is now 23 year's later and I have decided to share my story and the photographs. It has been quite an ordeal over the many year's. I just thought that I should share this information. Because people deserve to know the truth. Alien's are real.;44.7809000000001;-117.8267
Three lights in triangular formation.;2005-06-22 22:30:00;7 minutes;Three lights in triangular formation. While stargazing I noticed what appeared to be a fairly bright satelite moving against the stars. Then I realized that there were actually 3 lights moving in a triangular formation, with the brightest in the rear, and 2 dimmer lights leading. They were headed in a southeasterly direction, towards the rising Moon. I watched them, in total, for at least 7 minutes. When I first noticed them, they were moving at a typical satelight speed, and after returning from grabbing the binoculars from my car, they had slowed to the point where they hung almost stationary in the sky. I was very surprised that they hadn't moved out of my range while getting the binoculars. They slowed so much that there was only minimal movement against the stars. I watched them, with the binoculars until I lost them in the Moon's glow. They did not appear to drop in altitude with the distance and never appeared more than points of solid golden light throughout the sighting.;44.7809000000001;-117.8267

It reflected so much light that I assumed it was the ISP. After about 10 seconds of observation, the light slightly increased in brightness as it snapped West for a 5 seconds followed  by requisition of original course, emitted a blueish beam of light tha angled down toward the West then the light immediately disappeared. Nothing more.;44.7809000000001;-117.8267
