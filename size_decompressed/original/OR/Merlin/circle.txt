I just thought it was my eyes so i went in to get my wife she saw the same thing that i saw . so iwent in to the house and got my cam corder and filmed about 20 min. of it. While watching it on the TV you could see it get large and small to a solid white light and get big again . It kind of looked like the planet earth spinning out of control at one piont . You could also see little lights coming in from the west and exiting the picter .It was in the south part of the sky at about 45 degrees. I have never seen any thing like it before .

Bright White,Green and Red lights over Merlin Area;2012-02-03 20:00:00;15-20 min.;Bright White,Green and Red lights over Merlin Area At approx. 8pm on Friday night, My inlaws were traveling north on I-5 in the Merlin area.  They noticed a bright light to the west, and thought it to be an incomming aircraft.  The light remained steady in brightness, but changed from Red to Green, and at that point, they realized the object was actually moving away from them.  The object seemed to continue floating to the west. They continued to observe it for aprox. 10 to 15 minutes.  My father in law called me and I observed the object far on the horizon for about 2 minutes before it disappeared.  It did not appear to be an airplane or satellite.  It travelled quite far to the western horizon before it softly flared out.;42.5293;-123.438
