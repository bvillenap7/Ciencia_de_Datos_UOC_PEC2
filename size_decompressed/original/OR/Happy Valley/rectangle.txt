It was flying over one of the buildings in my community.  I couldn’t really make out what shape it was because of the lights that it had, but it wasn’t quite round maybe close to a wide rectangle.  The whole bottom of the object was glowing an Amber/orange color and on the left and the right side each side had one red glowing light.  The way the lights looked was so strange because it was like looking at lights glowing through a fog.  You couldn’t distinctly see the light but it was glowing and you could see the color.  There was no fog or clouds this night it was clear so I thought that was odd.  The object was moving slowly and silently as it moved.  It move north over the building and I started walking very fast because I wanted to get around the building to not loose my line of sight.  I did lose sight for about 5 seconds as I rounded the! corner of the building and in those 5 seconds it was gone.  I remember thinking I wanted to record it, but didn’t want to look away from it because I didn’t want to miss it.  I wanted to keep looking at this because it is something I have never seen before.  This was the first real ufo I have ever seen.  This blew my mind;45.4451;-122.5397
