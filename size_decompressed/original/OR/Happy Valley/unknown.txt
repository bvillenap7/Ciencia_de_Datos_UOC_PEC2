PD));2009-07-18 22:55:00;2-5 minutes;bright neon object moves from west to east, then darts to the unknown. with the blink of an eye. i witnessed a bright light moving from west to east at about 20000 ft or higher i estimate..  it moved without no sound and it was extrememly bright like a neon white light..  it wasnt blinking, i also know it wasnt a plane becasue there was a plane on the opposite horizon and looked nothing alike...  with blinking lights.   it was almost a star shaped light...   i saw the same light/object a couple nights before on the oppsite horizon, but it wasnt moving...  i kinda thought it was the north star but it was way to big to be a star...     and it was moving last night and in a different location.
