Bright pulsing light moving at fast speeds over Milwaukie, Oregon;2007-01-22 22:30:00;7 min.;Bright pulsing light moving at fast speeds over Milwaukie, Oregon I noticed the object when it was at a distance of about 5 miles away and probably several thousand feet high. I was on my third floor balcony having a smoke at about 10:30pm on the evening of 1/22/07.   At first I thought it was a star because it just appeared to be a weak white light in the sky.  Then I realized it was moving slowly in a straight horizontal line, and so I assumed it was a private aircraft. After I watched it for maybe 10 seconds, it suddenly dropped straight down in a vertical line about a thousand feet or so in just a few seconds, so I knew immediately it was not a conventional aircraft.  I called my friend to join me outside and take a look, because I didn't know if I could trust my own eyes with what I was seeing.  He witnessed the same thing I did.   Next, the light began to shine brilliantly, pulsing between red, blue, green, purple and white while flying again in a perfect horizontal line - only now it had dropped below the tree line.  But because it was winter and many of the trees had lost their leaves, it was still fairly easy to track.  The light would extinguish sometimes and then reappear in seconds a mile or so away - and at different heights.  And after watching it for about 7 minutes, it finally disappeared.  It was a perfectly clear night sky, so I know it could not have been a spotlight reflecting off of a cloud.  Additionally the craft generated no sound, and no other aircraft were observed during the sighting. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous.  PD));45.4451;-122.5397

The green light appeared to be the brightest part of it.  As it turned, a dimmer white light was visible. I have no idea what it was.  I've never seen a meteor, satellite, plane, or other aircraft behave this way.;45.4451;-122.5397
