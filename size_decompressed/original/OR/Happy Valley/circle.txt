Very large slow moving orb over Portland Area.;2016-11-29 06:45:00;20 minutes;Very large slow moving orb over Portland Area. My property sits at 1000 feet on Mt Scott, facing West.  Approximately 6:45 we observed a very bright orb emanating colors of green, red, blue, but mostly bright white.  The object moved very slowly south-west.  From Happy Valley, the object appeared first from the direction of Wilsonville.  We observed the object for about 20 minutes as small aircraft in the area apparently saw it as well.  The smaller planes over Portland started flying in circles over the area and towards the object.  It was far bigger than any landing lights as there is a flight pattern over Portland that goes from South to North.  I verified the sighting with a Meade Telescope using a 22mm lens, and binoculars of very high quality.  I captured some pictures and video, but quality isn't much to share.;45.4451;-122.5397
