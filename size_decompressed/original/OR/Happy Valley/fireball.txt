Observed Meteir/Fireball;2008-12-10 19:25:00;5-9 seconds;Observed Meteir/Fireball I was driving southbound (near Happy Valley, Oregon) on I-205 & noticed the meteor traveling East to West.   It was located high in  the sky-I would compare it to the a degree as Venus (when you can see Venus @ 18:00 here in OR)  It was blueish/white in color.  To my knowledge media hasn't covered it. (I don't see how anyone else traveling in the same direction wouldn't have noticed;45.4451;-122.5397
Two separate fireballs descending slowly, in different parts of sky,one touching ground very near us, the far one vanishing at horizon;2011-09-23 19:50:00;3 0r 4 seconds;Two separate fireballs descending slowly, in different parts of sky,one touching ground very near us, the far one vanishing at horizon Thought we should report this since news this morning about the satellite plunging into the Pacific and that scientists may never know if any debris from it landed in North America compels us,,,last evening (Friday) we spotted two descending balls of fire, one descending straight down and landing in a small field and not causing a fire, the other moving diagonally near earth and near our location.  Both were firey and both were descending at a speed best described as leisurely, not meteoric.  We are returning to the first site and will report back if we find any remains.;45.4451;-122.5397
