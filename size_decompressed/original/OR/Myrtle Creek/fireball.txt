Bright orange orb moving through the sky.;2012-08-07 22:50:00;1-2 minutes;Bright orange orb moving through the sky. Single bright orange orb came over the hill and continued southwest at a fairly slow rate of speed. It disappeared into the trees about 3/4 of the way down the west side of the hill. It didn't seem to burn out, but seemed to land in the trees.  No sound. Didn't change shape or color. This is the second time we have seen a very similar orange orb acting this way. The first time was in the begining of July. We thought it was some sort of fireworks but there was no sound and seemed to be moving too slowly for fireworks.;43.0165;-123.2959
Orange fireball observed in sky over Southern Oregon.;2014-06-26 22:15:00;20 minutes;Orange fireball observed in sky over Southern Oregon. At about 10:15 pm, June 26, 2014, we observed a single yellowish/orange fireball in the northern sky.  We had light cloud cover yet we were able to see the round fireball.  Had the fireball been higher in the sky I believe the fireball would have been more visible only as light coming through the clouds.  Yet, it was either below the cloud layer or just barely into it as we were able to see the glow and a small dot in the center.  It stayed stationary as we continued to watch.  As we watched in disbelief and were equally curious as to what this object was, it began to burn out.  Though as we watched it we were not sure if it actually did burn out or moved away from us.   We do know that this object did not move laterally at any high rate of speed.;43.0165;-123.2959
