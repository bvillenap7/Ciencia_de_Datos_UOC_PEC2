orange-yellow fire dribbled  stright down from the object;2007-04-12 20:30:00;2 to 3 minutes;orange-yellow fire dribbled  stright down from the object raApproximately, 8:30 PM April, 12 2007 looking Southeast 25 to 30 degrees from the horizon, I saw a bright orange-yellow light at an elevation of 2000 to 3000 ft. I first thought it to be a general aviation aircraft landing light because of the size of the light and the speed of the object. The object moving to the Northwest over the town of Stayton Oregon, I observed a rotating red anti-collision light behind and above the orange-yellow light which was about a half of degree in width. Then something strange happened, dribbles of fire shot straight down from the object and burned out 200 to 300 feet blow the object. {similar to tracers being fired from a automatic weapon except the burning objects where different sizes and not even spacing like what would happen with tracer, and only burn for a few hundred feet } this occurred three times before the object went behind a cloud and was out of view. I called the Salem Police they had no information on any stricken aircraft.  I called the Stayton Police they had gotten a 911 call about 8:30 PM of a similar sighting and directed them to call the McMinnville FAA.  I called the McMinnville FAA and was told they did not know of any aircraft reporting any malfunction in the area.;44.8032;-122.7605
