I saw a green triangular shaped object fly from horizon to horizon as i was coming home from work.  If you knew the area, it would have been from the mill towards Siletz, OR.  If I were to wave my arm from side to side, that is how quickly it moved from horizon to horizon.  Distictively, green and a definite triangular shape.  Green as in the acrylic paint  green.  I was travelling approximately 50 mph. with no visible near traffic.;44.628;-123.9256
