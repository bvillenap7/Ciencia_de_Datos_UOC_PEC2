At approx. 11:11 pm  I, the mother, saw three white lights in triangular  formation moving slowly and silently above us.  I pointed it out to my son and he pointed up then his friend saw it, too.  I wanted to go into the house and get binoculars but my son grabbed hold of me and said, No, something might happen.  We watched as this very large triangle moved from north to south.  To my surprise , after about 5 min. it stopped its movement looked as if the lights were pulsing then it disappeared just like a switch had turned them off.   All three of us were still gaping at the sky for a moment or two then I went into the house and saw the time was 11:17pm.;44.5319;-122.8865
