Saw a hovering silvery cylinder object sticking out from behind group of trees.;1999-01-11 09:30:00;2 min;Saw a hovering silvery cylinder object sticking out from behind group of trees. I was driving my car from Albany to Sweet Home with my 2 year old grandson with me. I stopped at a stop sign at the cross roads of Grand Prairie Rd.and Hwy-20 facing east.  Across the road in front (east) of me was a stand of trees in a field (like maybe oak trees). Up in the air 30 ft or so and sticking out from behind the trees was a silver cylinder object just hovering there perfectly still.It was smooth and silvery with no markings or lights or anything.  It made no sound.It reminded me of a water tower or something because it had no movement.  It seemed so solidly held there in the air but I could not see any visible means of support. I wanted to go see what it was for sure but I was concerned for the safety of my grandson.  So I went ahead and turned right (south) but kept my eye on the object for as long as I could.  I drove about a minute down the road and it was out of sight now.  I decided I had to go back and check it out.I turned around and went back.  It was gone,  I drove down the road and looked behind those trees and all around in the field etc.  It was not in the air, not on the ground, not anywhere that I could see.  It had disappeared.;44.5319;-122.8865
