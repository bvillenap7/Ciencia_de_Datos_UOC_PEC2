Clear sky. No evidence of any flaring out like a rocket reentering the atmosphere and the lights did not separate out. The lights appeared to be all connected in a straight line. Two witnesses watched for about 3 minutes from the time we first saw them until they passed out of sight. In our many years of sky watching my Coast Guard veteran husband and I have never seen anything like it! I am a retired College employee with a longtime interest in astronomy.;44.5319;-122.8865
