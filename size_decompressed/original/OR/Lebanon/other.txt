Observed a large grey illuminated dog-bone shaped object to right of moon.;1999-07-28 04:30:00;30 seconds;Observed a large grey illuminated dog-bone shaped object to right of moon. I am a 32 year old female, with a B.S. Degree in Psychology and I am currently working for the State of Oregon on the Y2K Project. My husband was outside at 04:15 taking pictures of the partial lunar eclipse when he excitedly called for me stating that he was seeing a UFO.  I rushed out to the open window and looked south toward the moon to where he indicated he saw the object. My husband handed me the binoculars. To the right of the moon I could detect a faint, illuminated light grey object in the shape of a dog bone, about half the diameter of the moon. The two ends were easier to see, but I could see a connecting center. I observed it traveling very slowly and by this time it was about 2:00 by the moon.  There were no indicator lights on it (such as on a plane, and there was no sound).  As it continued heading right, and away from the moon, it was less visible, until it competely disappeared from my sight.;44.5319;-122.8865
ALL IT MY STATEMENT;2011-07-15 22:00:00;5 - 6 min.;ALL IT MY STATEMENT MY WIFE AND HER FRIEND CALLED ME TO THE BACK YARD TO SEE SOMETHING MOVING IN THE SKY.  IT WAS DARK IN THE SKY NO SUN SET LEFT. I WAS LOOKING WEST AS THEY POINTED.  WHAT I FIRST SAW WAS A BRIGHT, BRIGHT LIGHT IN THE FAR WEST MOVING EAST. (IT WAS A LILLE FARTHER NORTH THAN US MAYBE 1/2 MILE)  AS IT MOVE ACROSS THE SKY IT LOOKED THE SAME. LIKE SOMETHING IN THE CENTER(TO HAZY & BRIGHT TO SEE)  WITH BRIGHT RAYS STICKING OUT A LITTLE. I COUNTED AT LEAST EIGHT. AS IT MOVE IT STOPPED AND WEAVED BACK AND FORTH A LITTLE.  IT MOVED SLOWER THAN A AIRPLANE AND NO SOUND.  WE ARE OVER HALF WAY A CROSS THE VALLEY WE LIVE IN. AS WE WATCH IT GO THE LIGHT DID NOT CHANGE IN SIZE OR SHAPE.IT WAS NOW NORTH OF US AND I THOUGHT IT WOULD CHANGE,AS IT STARTED MOVING A WAY FROM US TO THE EAST.BUT IT LOOKED THE SAME, NO CHANGE ON A DIFFERENT ANGLE. I RAN IT THE HOUSE AND GRABBED MY BINOCULARS AS I RAN OUT THE GIRLS WERE YELLING FOR ME TO COME OUT. THE OBJECT WAS GROWING LARGER ( X3 ) AND QU! ITE BRIGHTER. I THREW THE BINOCULARS UP WHAT I SAW WAS THE SAME BUT LARGER, A BRIGHT WHITE CENTER WITH THE EIGHT OR SO RAYS COMING OUT. IT HAD STOP FOR A FEW SECONDS WHEN IT WENT BRIGHTER. NOW IT DIMMED   BACK TO HOW IT WAS BEFORE. AS IT MOVED NE ( NOW AWAY FROM ME ) IT STAYED THE SAME SIZE. AND AS IT WENT IT SWAYED BACK A FORTH SLOWLY.  THE HOLE TIME IT WAS ABOUT THE SAME HEIGHT.  ( ABOUT HALF AS HIGH AS SMALL AIRPLANES FLY )  WAS LARGER THAN A PLANE AND SO BRIGHT.  LOOKED LIKE A STAR. TO SLOW FOR A PLANE. NOT A HELICOPTER NO SOUND.  WAS THE STRANGEST THING I'VE SEEN IN MY 51 YEARS. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));44.5319;-122.8865
