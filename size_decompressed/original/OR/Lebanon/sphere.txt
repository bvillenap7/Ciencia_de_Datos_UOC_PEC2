It was a clear sunny day (cold), we seen a “silver” sphere like object in the air. I thought it could have been a silver balloon falling but it slowly paused then moved fairly rapidly out of site. Don’t know what it was but figured we would report it and maybe some other people saw it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

Orb in the sky that did not move.;2017-09-24 18:30:00;10 minutes;Orb in the sky that did not move. It was an orb in the sky pretty far up.  Wife thought it was drone for personal use, but it did not move for 10 minutes, and then seemed to leave around the time some planes were flying by.   The original reason to look in the sky was the sound of a fighter jet, and in looking to the sky for the jet, seen the orb.  Light clouds did pass over it and it remained for a while.  Then dissapeared .;44.5319;-122.8865
