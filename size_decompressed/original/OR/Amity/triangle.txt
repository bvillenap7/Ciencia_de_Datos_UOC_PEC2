3 triangle shaped objects with no lights or sound flying over Amity, Oregon.;2019-10-29 03:15:00;5 seconds;3 triangle shaped objects with no lights or sound flying over Amity, Oregon. As I was getting ready for work I went outside to have a cigarette around 3:15am. I looked up at the sky like I normally do this time to see 3 white triangles flying through the sky. They were traveling North to South and had no lights or sound. At first I thought they were geese, but again there was no sound and there were only 3 objects. I was only able to watch them for 5-7 seconds before they flew out of sights behind some trees. I don't know what I saw, what flies in the sky at night with no sounds or lights and is white in color and is rectangular shaped??;45.1197;-123.175
