Pulsating pair of lights traveling SW to NW over Western Oregon.;2018-11-06 19:30:00;7 minutes;Pulsating pair of lights traveling SW to NW over Western Oregon. 2 lights traveled from SW to NW in clear evening sky, well above commercial aircraft path also visible at same time.  The lights followed each other and they would light up bright for about 1.5 seconds than fade out as they left a trail to the next flash and so on.  These lights traveled relatively slow, but since their altitude was relatively high, it's difficult to determine actual speed.  Both lights faded as they traveled off to NW.  No sound was audible.;45.1197;-123.175
