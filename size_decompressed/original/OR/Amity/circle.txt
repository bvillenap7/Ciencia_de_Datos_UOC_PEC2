Could not est. size. An orange fireball moving west and slow when compared with a meteor. Did seem to have a slight vapor trail. I watched this object for about 5 seconds. It was lateral to me and probably no more than 3 city blocks away. Looked to be no higher than 2-3 telephone poles high. I reported to the State police in Mcminnville oregon. It is my first sighting and I have always been a skeptic. I am not now. Thank you. ((personal data deleted)) Mcminnville , Ore. 97128. Ph: 503-((# deleted)). E - mail.
