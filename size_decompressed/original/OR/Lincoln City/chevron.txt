Translucent HUGE flying object with HUGE wings.;2018-09-21 02:00:00;5 seconds;Translucent HUGE flying object with HUGE wings. We were sitting on the balcony, star gazing, because we had heard that there was going to be a meteor shower....we were only out watching about 20 minutes, when a huge thing with wings flew over us.  Actually it glides over us.  Never flapped its wings.  The wings were so captivating!  Large and translucent like....we could see the stars just as clear as before, even with this giant thing flying over.  At least two car lengths long!  It was not a bird of ANY KIND.   We also had lost power almost one hour before this happened in the casino hotel.;44.9090101769911;-123.988876769911
