(1st) North Lincoln City, Lincoln County, OR.  I saw a elongated diamond shape over a motel near the beach.  It ppleared to have its underside tilted/angled toward the land.  Within the crisp outlined/edged dark diamond shape were regularly interval spaced/patterned in red and blue color.  As Inwas staring at it, trying to figure out how close or large it might be, noticed others to the right (farther north) and much, much higher in the sky... the main (closer) and others were stationary, motionless.  No sound made that I could detect of the maIn one... and other’s were far too distant to know if made sound... so small because of distance that they were barely discernable as the same diamond shape blue and red light patternon each. Eventually I got in my pickup - still pondering what I’d been watching.... five miles south (approx 8-10 mins after leaving 1st sighting) - south of Lincoln City, as approaching Siletz turn-off from hwy 101 - same scene east of 101, but appeared to be facing the ocean, closest one - same object Shape and Color (red and blue) and pattern of lights... and again, others, maybe 10, appearing much smaller because of being much, much higher in the sky.   Turned up Siletz River... drove into town of Siletz.  As I was approaching town of Siletz, as I was 1/4 to 1/2 a mile from town, again saw one of same objects closer to ground, and a scattering (maybe 8 or so) of the others positioned much higher in the sky - by then it was a little about 11:40 pm.;44.9090101769911;-123.988876769911

Looked past it and over a motel to the west, (maybe beyond - it over ocean) was a dark diamond shaped object in sky - with lighted surface facing land - a symetrical pattern of red and blue lights - I watched for a minute or several, then Realized there were others much higher in sky to the north (near a dozen) - same shape, same lights, in random scattered pattern in sky - all of similar size/distance from me.  All remained stationary the few minutes I watched them thought of taking a photo, wish I had, but also remember having a concern that if I took a photo, it (whatever it was) might not take kindly to a photo being taken.  It remained stationary as did the others high up.  I got in upickup and drove south, again at Siletz River, another/same shape and lights arrangement over lower Siletz River, lights facing west this time, and again, about same number of others like it higher up in sky and tho! se again, seemed more parallel to ground (less angled east or west)  - wrote up soon after and sent to this site, but received reply to fill out online form - and haven’t til now. I also did a drawing to illustrate.;44.9090101769911;-123.988876769911
