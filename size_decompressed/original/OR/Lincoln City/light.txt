Obj. travelling n/nw at satelite altitude. intermittent (irregular) brilliant white bursts, faded to pale yellow.  2nd obj  w/same m/o ;1997-05-02 22:45:00;6-8 minutes;Summary : Obj. travelling n/nw at satelite altitude. intermittent (irregular) brilliant white bursts, faded to pale yellow.  2nd obj  w/same m/o as 1st. .  Binocs & t-scope. While stargazing my friend Ron and I observed a brilliant white flash to the south of us.  This was two or three minutes after having sighted a satellite passing from south to north. After an interval of perhaps 15-20 seconds we both observed a second flash and were able to make out object with naked eye.  Appeared very similar to satellite that had just passed.

At first, the object was headed due north, then, at about 80 degrees (almost directly overhead) it veered about ten degrees west, then continued in a straight line n/nw.  During its traverse trained his telescope on object.  He has done this many time with aircraft and can make out the navigation lights of such.  This had no visible navigation lights.  The glow, or i!ntensity of light at dim stage, and the comparison to satellites we have observed would put this object at satellite height. No tail observed.  Both of us have seen many aircraft at night and are familiar with what a strobe looks like at great altitude.  This was far more intense and the intermittent nature was not like A/C strobes.  It appeared to accelerate at burst and slow down with dimming? Weird. As the object was about 10 degrees or less from dropping out of our view in the N/NW, a second object appeared to the west of the first at approximately the same distance and displayed the same white burst behavior.  Alternated bursts with first object.;44.9090101769911;-123.988876769911

It was about 3 or 4 times brighter than a star. Then it got dimmer and disappeared. We both witnessed this are both educated in science. There is no way a satillite could ever get that bright. There were four of us at my mothers condo in Otter Crest on June 16, 1999. At about 11 pm at night my friend and I were looking at the stars. We noticed something that was moving way too fast to be a sattilite. The light kept getting brighter and brighter. It was about 3 or 4 times the brightness of a star or planet. It then got dimmer and then disappeared. We are both highly educated in the science fields and agree that there is no way that could of been a satillite or space debris.;44.9090101769911;-123.988876769911
Sighted bright light about 35-40 degrees eastern sky that pulsed, dimming to barely visible, gradually increasing to bright again.;1999-11-17 02:00:00;1 hour;Sighted bright light about 35-40 degrees eastern sky that pulsed, dimming to barely visible, gradually increasing to bright again. My husband and I were returning home from Lincoln City to Albany, Orgon about 2 a.m. 11/17/99, when we noticed a very bright, white light in about the location Jupiter had been a few weeks ago, but about 3 to 4 times as large and pulsating very slowly from extremely bright to so dim it was barely visible. It did not seem to move at all, just to hang in the same position. It was visible throughout the 75 mile trip, and we stopped at a gas station in Monmouth, Oregon, where the attendants also commented on it. It was very curious and not like any object we have seen it the night sky before.;44.9090101769911;-123.988876769911
Orange/bronze flare of light over ocean,  not moving.;2001-09-18 22:00:00;1-2 minutes;Orange/bronze flare of light over ocean,  not moving. While vacationing in Lincoln City at the Westshore Ocean Front Motel, my wife and I were sitting near the big picture window of our hotel room on the beach looking out over the ocean. We were both staring at the same patch of sky high over the horizon when a sudden flare of light attracted our attention directly west. It suddenly grew in brilliance/size, a orange/bronze color, faded slightly, then grew again. It did not change location. Although their were military jets in the vicinity early in the day because of 9/11, being ex-military, I know what we saw was not afterburners or military style anti heat-seeking missile flares. By the time we went for our video camera the light was gone. Turning on the police scanner, there was some traffic regarding military activity in the area, but with no details.

I saw something very peculiar out over the ocean last night about 6:00 pm.  I'm watching the news on TV and I glance out my window to see a very bright star.  I say to myself, That's odd.  I've never seen a bright star there before.  Next thing I know, the star starts to meander about for about 5-10 seconds. Then, it just disappears.  A couple minutes later, the star reappears in about the same area. It meanders about for about 5 seconds and is then, joined by another bright star, right next to it. Both stars meander about slowly, as if in a dance, seeming to merge at one point. They then separate, but keep a close distance, meandering some more.  Then, they both just disappear, as if turning off a light switch.;44.9090101769911;-123.988876769911

Bright lights of unknown origins witnessed by two individuals over the Pacific Ocean.  ((NUFORC Note:  Space Shuttle w/ ISS??  PD));2007-06-19 22:30:00;90 seconds;Bright lights of unknown origins witnessed by two individuals over the Pacific Ocean I was sitting in our car with my boyfriend, we are in our mid thirties.  We were watching the evening sky grow dark.  The sun set around 9ish.  When I first started viewing the night sky a sliver of a moon and a bright star to the right were visible if you are facing the pacific ocean. As the darkness increased I became aware of two brighter objects appearing between the moon and the bright star.  At first I thought they were stars that were further away and needed more darkness to be seen.  That was until they started to move.  They took off from over the ocean headed southeast at a fairly decent pace.   By this point I have caught my boyfriends attention because I practically had my face planted in the windshield. It was at this point I asked the question to no one in particular and to myself out loud What in the hell is that?  My boyfriend noticed what I was seeing and we both started exiting the car, him to get the camcorder out of the trunk I already had my camera in hand and was ready to take pictures.  I started shooting as soon as I could but didn't think I was getting anything so I kept looking over the camera to make sure I was pointing it in the right direction.  Meanwhile my boyfriend was getting the camcorder trying to capture what we were seeing.  While I was trying to capture the still shots I witnessed a triangular shaped silver object appear 40 to 50 feet above my head going to the right or northwardly up the beach no sound accompanied any of these objects.  When I gave up in my attempts to get pictures and turned back to my boyfriend to see if he was getting it on film I witnessed them disappear into the southeastern sky.  May be a minute later we witnessed two light seemingly further away and dimmer flying a bit further apart flying from the SW to the NE.  We are not sure if they were the same two or two new ones. We watched the sky for about another half an hour and witnessed nothing else at that location.  We finally headed back to our motel room about a quarter mile from the original sigh ting.  We discussed what each had seen my boyfriend confirmed the two bright lights I had seen but he says he saw a third light I didn't see forming a triangle shape with the first two but he reports that he didn't witness the triangular silver object that I seen headed north.   We spent the rest of that evening watching the skies off the oregon coast and an orange glow of what looked to be something burning on the horizon where the sky meets the ocean.  We don't know what we saw that night. We both agree it was like nothing we have ever seen before.  However we did capture video of this event. ((NUFORC Note:  Space Shuttle w/ ISS??

array of lights over the ocean;2008-09-22 21:00:00;15 seconds;array of lights over the ocean I live on the Oregon coast and I have a view of the ocean.   It’s nighttime and I’m watching TV, when I look out my window and I see a bright light appear, following by another bright light next to it, following by another and another until 5 bright lines all appear in a row.   All 5 lights stayed on for about a couple seconds and then, they all turned off.   The whole event lasted no more than about 15 seconds. The lights appeared at about 35-40 degrees about the horizon.  The lights “turned on” in a rhythmic fashion, each coming on in 2 second intervals, from left to right (south to north).  Each light was spaced the same distance from each other.  If I were to hold my fist out in the direction of the lights (palm down), the array of lights would cover a half-fist. I saw something similar to this, in the very same location on the horizon, in January 2005.   At that time, I also made an entry to the National Reporting Center.;44.9090101769911;-123.988876769911
irratic star movement;2011-01-01 00:00:00;10 SECONDS;irratic star movement I was watching the stars & saw what looked like a star which moved from left to right across the night sky(south to north).  The light started low from the left in an arching motion, then as it finished its arch flattened out and straight lined across the sky.  It moved at a very swift rate of speed and looked like just another star.  However the trajectory and speed could be nothing like a star or anything Ive ever seen.  Two different movements.  Arching like a rainbow and then flattening out with great speed. Never a believer or witness to such unexplainable sighting, I'm set back by it.  I'm sure this was definitely a UFO.Nothing I know of could move like this.  Again it just looked like a star but moved like no star can.  And definitely not any kind of airplane.

Five people at Devil's Lake observed 15 orb shaped orangish lights, they came from the East, turned to the South East and disappeared into the sky.  At one time three were visible.  The lowest one came down towards the lake and appeared to reflect in the lake before disappearing.;44.9090101769911;-123.988876769911
Five red lights in night sky.;2012-09-16 21:10:00;3 minutes;Five red lights in night sky. Five red lights in the NW sky. At first appeared stationary in a cluster. Then as if moving toward us in a southerly direction.  Then ascended one by one and faded (or simply disappeared) out of sight.  The lowest light did not ascend but simply faded or went out of sight.  Absolutely NO sound.;44.9090101769911;-123.988876769911
Slow moving bright light in the sky.;2013-07-18 00:10:00;5 minutes;Slow moving bright light in the sky Working at a hotel on the beach in Lincoln City, I looked to the Eastern horizon and witnessed a light travelling south.  The light was orange, like the color of a street-lamp, and bright, like an airplane with its headlights on.  It travelled a slower than I am used to seeing planes fly, but at a steady pace.  It was too bright to be a satellite.  It could be an airplane with its lights on, though that seems improbable given our relation to any airports. I continued to watch this odd light fly south.  After a few minutes the light began to pulse, or change, as if the light was turning away from me then back toward me again.  This happened for a minute or two then the light just extinguished altogether.  I kept watching for approximately five minutes, but never saw the light again. This is the second time I have encountered a sighting such as this, which has prompted me to write this encounter.  The first time was in early April (I don't remember the exact date), a very similar encounter except this original encounter occurred at 9:30 pm, the light was bright white and not orange, and it was travelling West to East much more overhead, rather than near the horizon.  But everything else was the same, the time-span, the way it 'pulsed', and the way it went out altogether. Very interested if anyone has witness this here in Lincoln county or surrounding areas.

Bright Light - Moved Extremely Fast.;2016-12-25 21:30:00;1 minute;Bright Light - Moved Extremely Fast I was on a friend's front porch, at the extreme Northern edge of Lincoln City, OR, around 9:30 p.m Dec. 25th 2016.  I saw a blue-white light in the distance.  It appeared to be a couple of miles or so away.  The direction of the light from me was about Northeast.  I could see the outer most two stars in the Big Dipper above the light.  The other Big Dipper stars were hidden by some fir trees.  What caught my attention was the light looked like two lights very close together, then they seemed to be moving right and left very slowly.   Also, it seemed much too bright to be a star that low above the horizon.  I saw the light for about a minute and then it zipped off extremely fast towards the Pacific Ocean.  I was astounded at the speed that this thing moved!;44.9090101769911;-123.988876769911

It was just sitting there stationary all during the display.  When they were over about 10:20 PM, I kept watching it and it turned red and slowly began to move around, first left and then right and slowly started to move right (Northerly) when all of a sudden it zipped away super fast and kinda went by us, but high up in the air and out of sight.  I have a feeling it might have been a drone, as I have not been around them, but I didn't think they went up that high.  Anyway, I thought I would report it and see if anyone else saw it and if you could confirm that it was a drone.  It was very weird.  Thank you.;44.9090101769911;-123.988876769911
