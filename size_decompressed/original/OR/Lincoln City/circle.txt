Our group saw a single object orange in color that looked like a camp fire in the sky pass from west to east coming from the beach we then saw another two traveling in the same direction with the same appearance. This time we noted that there was absolutely no sound associated with the objects.  The night was completely silent.  At this time we retrieved a pair of high powered binoculars and we're able to thoroughly observe the next 4 objects that flew by in the same direction (2 at a time approximately 5 min appart).  The objects observed through the binoculars were just a diffuse orange light with no other lights and no sign of a visible shape.  At this time we called 911 who patched us through to the coast guard who said there were no training maneuvers or rescues occuring at this time and all of their choppers were on the ground.  We then discussed the possibility of f-15 training flights out of PDX who were lighting their afterburners but due to our close Proximity to the lights and their complete silence this seems unlikely.;44.9090101769911;-123.988876769911
Light orb over Lincoln City, Or.;2013-08-08 21:35:00;4 minutes;Light orb over Lincoln City, Or. About 9:35 PT in Lincoln City, OR, my daughter and I took the dog out for a break before bedtime.  While we were waiting for the dog to do its thing, I noticed an odd glowing orb/circle in  the sky traveling north to south almost parallel to the coastline.  The object moved at a fast pace and was much closer than the stars.   I thought at first this was a plane and patiently waited for it to pass overhead but instead it just stopped in the sky at about 75 degrees from my point of view  It flickered a lot and had an orange color but also some yellow to it. It pulsed.     I swear something dropped from it but I'm not certain.  I saw something fall but my daughter did not.  As we watched the stationary light it started to flicker abruptly then turned to the west and slowly started to fade away as if it was going up.    This was no plane. Fortunately my daughter was with me and witnessed this as well.   This all lasted about 4 minutes. I kept periodically going outside that evening looking for this light but it never returned.;44.9090101769911;-123.988876769911

Bright and wavy;2020-08-24 21:20:00;15;Bright and wavy One by one the objects came and went right above us. Some going in diagonal directions. There would be a few that would flash a brighter light then go back to its normal brightness and fly along in the sky. Some would travel fast and some slower than others. Every minutes or so another would come. It lasted about 15 minutes. There was this one particular one, it was bright and a shape of a circle, when it came closer to us it flashed its lights real bright then left. It was moving in a wavy motion as well. Zig zag like. I do have video proof of this object I am talking about.;44.9090101769911;-123.988876769911
