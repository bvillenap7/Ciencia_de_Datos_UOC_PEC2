Lights on horizon - object(s) approached, main craft  opened/smaller craft played returned to original & hover above us;1997-03-17 09:00:00;9 to 10 minutes;Lights on horizon - object(s) approached, main craft  opened/smaller craft played returned to original & hover above us Date approximate.  Very clear night.  Back deck of friend's home, appx. 3 blocks from beach.  Appx 9 pm.  I observed 2-4 very faint fuzzy lights coming from VERY VERY (NW) general area of Hale Bopp/Cascade Head area.  They got to horizon, lined up in straight line, moving slowly south.  Rubbed my eyes I had been crying & didn't know what I was seeing.   After a few seconds I called to other 3 adults in house. All of us speechless. Cam-corder right inside door but not able to take eyes off sky to get it.  SO AWESTRUCK. ALMOST RELIGIOUS.  Holding side of deck to keep from falling.  Nearly faint twice.  One man said Oh My God they know we are watching because of comet and eclipse.  They want us to see them  Getting larger... no - getting closer, high in sky.  Biggest one stood still, bright white light appears on bottom af thing, many (dozen or more) colored, lighted (mostly white) little ones appear and start spinning and chasing each other.  We laugh they're playing.  (We said Mother Ship?)  They return to white light (a couple mins. elapsed) 3 (Triangle?) shapes surrounded by light red green white, sequential blinking. Now hovering directly above enough to see triangle formation of 3 seperate crafts. Hover above for 1-2 minutes, we felt they were almost trying to communicate w/us through lights. NO SOUND or WIND AT ALL. Suddenly, still blinking, crafts split into 2 groups, one SPED OFF SO FAST (no sound) toward NE others to NW (VERY GENERAL DIRECTION). In a second or 2 they were gone as we watched them, not faded as in fireworks but gone as in car lights. Travel at unheard of speeds. TOTALLY UNBELIEVABLE! All crying, one went back in room and wouldn't talk. (Day later says he'd been in military all life and this was not military, and that he was scared.) I Called police about 10 minutes after 9 pm, who gave me # to UFO in Seattle, and I called as PD advised even tho they vehemently said it was a flare(s) and that they do not recognize/acknowledgethe presence of UFO's. We were also attempted contact by Coast Guard and Air Force, but had new ph. # and I gave them old one, which I found out when I called back to see if any other reports came in. At appx 9:30 PD called me and said flares were now being shot off Cascade Head (so I guess my question was answered!) After so many years I have only told this to family and a couple friends as it is so outrageous. We all 4 saw the exact same thing.  I'd like to talk about it as it is so imbedded in my mind...and bothers me. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));44.9090101769911;-123.988876769911
Three lights traveling south to north up the oregon coastline Friday July 13th at aprox. 1:13AM;2007-07-13 01:13:00;approx 10 sec.;Three lights traveling south to north up the oregon coastline Friday July 13th at aprox. 1:13AM  500 Lights On Object0: Yes On July 13th 2007 at approximately 1:13am I was on the Oregon beach in Lincoln City.  It was a very clear evening I was with my father and my husband having a beach fire.  They where facing inland and I was facing the water.  I was looking at my father who was standing to my left when I noticed what looked like “shooting stars” traveling northbound in the sky.  I started to watch and when I realized that it was three sharp bright lights traveling in formation swiftly I said “what the ---- is that?” my husband turned just as I watched them traveling behind his head.  We both said ‘oh my god’ and then at that moment the lights seemed to just disappear. The formation of lights in the sky where shaped like a triangle on its side.  Each of the three lights where the points of the triangle.  They stayed completely uniformed and traveled in a straight path from south to north as if following the coastline.  There where no sounds and the lights where sharp.  I watched the lights for about 10 seconds but I have never seen anything like that in my life!   I am so glad that my husband saw too but he only was watching for about half of the time I did.  It was breathtaking and scary and amazing all at the same time.  Also aprox. at 3:30am there was an orange/pink light glowing on the western horizon over the ocean that lasted for at least a few minutes.;44.9090101769911;-123.988876769911
3 orbs in triangle formation along Oregon coastline.;2016-04-17 21:30:00;45 seconds;3 orbs in triangle formation along Oregon Coastline My wife and I were sitting on a balcony of our room at the Inn at Spanish Head and were admiring the surf and the stars and how warm it was for April.  I looked up and saw three dimly lit orbs flying in a perfectly spaced, triangular formation.  It was hard to tell whether or not they were connected.  They were orbs with a dark line running through them at the halfway point of the circle, as if someone had put a band around a golf ball.  All bands were parallel to the ground.  It was dark so I could not see if they were connected or not.  I motioned to my wife to look up and she saw them, too.  It was totally silent, although any noise may have been drowned out by the sound of the surf.  These orbs flew south to north right along the coastline very quickly.;44.9090101769911;-123.988876769911
