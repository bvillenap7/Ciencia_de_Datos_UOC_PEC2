On September 16th around 9 p.m. my darling wife and I were outside on the deck of our vacation rental.  My wife spotted three individual lights in the sky well above the horizon to the North.  At first I had my back to the objects.  When I turned around I saw three bright, orange lights.  They were lined up and spaced apart in vertical order.  When my wife first spotted the objects she thought they might have been lights from an airplane.  However, they began moving around.  Up, down, side to side and the speed was very impressive.  The objects did not appear to be floating.  I went inside to retrieve our camera.  While inside my wife said two of the lights moved around and then vanished.  However, I did manage to get video footage of the last light before it too, vanished.  The footage clearly shows the object moving around.  THE MOVEMENT OF THE OBJECT WAS NOT CAUSED BY MOTION FROM THE CAMERA! .  I made sure of this by noting it while I filmed.  I'm no expert but I find it hard to believe that any aircraft we have today could do what these lights did.  Feel free to call me if you have any questions or would like to see the footage?    Thank you....;44.9090101769911;-123.988876769911

Sitting at the dinner table, my chair is the one facing the window, so I was the only one who saw it.. an orb looking white light appeared out of nowhere, traveled across the sky, then disappeared.. appeared from the east and traveled toward the west..  seemed to be traveling at a fast pace..;44.9090101769911;-123.988876769911
