12-inch long teardrop shaped hovering craft along Oregon Coast.;2013-11-12 02:48:00;25-30 seconds;12 inch long teardrop shaped hovering craft along Oregon Coast Recollection of Object Seen 11/12/13   I was at the Oregon coast two days ago vacationing with my boyfriend.  We were on the 6th floor of the 10 story hotel with all rooms facing west towards the ocean.  Outside our room was a 10 foot long balcony. We had slept most of the day, had a very late dinner and then a bath (no drinking or drugs were involved).  Both of us are veterinary professionals that work at an emergency clinic, oftentimes working long hours overnight, and are accustomed to being up late. It was about 2:45 am when we decided to get to bed.  I decided that I would take one last look at the ocean before going to sleep.  It was raining, blustery and cold.  The seaâ€™s waves were crashing.  As I stepped onto the balcony, I looked out west and saw a very elongated teardrop-looking object hovering in the air approximately 10-15 feet from the end of our balcony.  The night was dark, but the hotel had spotlights extending onto the beach.  This object appeared very dark-colored (maybe gray or black), about 12 inches long with a very rounded front end and a very sharp, long tail.  It also had a wide stripe of a faint greenish-yellow about 1/3 of the way from the tip of its nose.  There was a black circle (approximately 2 inches in diameter) in the middle of the stripe.  It made no noise, had no lights on it, nor did it have any mechanical moving parts. It hovered briefly in one spot, and then turned 90 degrees to face me.  It then turned again to its original sideways position, still hovering in one spot.  Next, the object (still in its sideways position looking like an elongated teardrop), began to move vertically in a very straight line up 10 feet, then down 20 feet, then up 5 feet, down 2 feet, and then up 20 feet, each time before moving up and down pausing at its original hover spot.  It then flew northeast over the hotel building.  All of this happened within 25-30 seconds.;44.9090101769911;-123.988876769911
