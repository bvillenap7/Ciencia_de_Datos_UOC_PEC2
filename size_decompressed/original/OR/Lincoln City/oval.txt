No idea what this object is;2003-09-23 13:23:00;See Below;No idea what this object is We took this picture while on vacation.  I never noticed it before but this evening when viewing our old pictures with a new digital monitor that is much larger than our old monitor I noticed this object in the picture.  I took a series of pics of approximately the same area and this thing only shows on one of them.  I have no idea what it is.  I have attached the pic for your viewing.
