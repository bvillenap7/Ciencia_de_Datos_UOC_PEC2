I was not wearing my watch, so the time of 11:00PM is only a guess, but I judge to have been in bed about an hour, having retired about 10:00PM. We were on the fifth (5th) floor of the hotel our room faced west, facing the ocean, and the drapes were partially open to allow a cool breeze to enter the room. The sky was clear, as it had been most of the day, because I could faintly see stars. I was lying in bed and looking out the door to the balcony. I had a clear view of the sky, though somewhat narrow because of the doorframe on one side and the edge of the sliding glass door on the other side, perhaps 4 feet in width. The room was dark. There suddenly appeared a long, bright light that appeared to be on a parallel course with the coastline and heading north, then suddenly made a sharp, 900 right-hand turn without slowing down and headed inland. I am not a good judge of altitude, but this thing was either flying low or it was very large. I am red-green color blind, but the object appeared to be a bright green in color. There was absolutely no sound whatsoever, only the faint sound of the ocean, but the object remained very bright for the short amount of time I was able to observe it. The bright color trailed behind the object, much like a long tail on a kite. I couldnâ€™t see any more than that because my field of vision was obstructed by the doorframe.  The object appeared cylindrical but with no clearly marked back end to it. I observed this object for about 3 seconds before it disappeared to the east.  I am retired from the security industry as a Field Supervisor, and during my twenty years I learned to be very observant of my surroundings, and to look for details. Prior to that I was in the U.S. Navy stationed aboard an aircraft carrier. During my years of watching jet aircraft of all types, I do not remember seeing any jet make the kind of maneuver that resembled the one I saw this object make. Nor do I recall seeing any jet aircraft of any kind travel at such an extremely high rate speed.;44.9090101769911;-123.988876769911

We went out on the deck to observe it traveling in a southerly direction.  As it disappeared another one appeared to the north and again traveled south, finally a 3rd one appeared and followed in the same southerly pattern.   There was no noise at all, they seemed to be about the size of a quarter and were maybe a mile high.   I only wish we could have taken a picture of them.;44.9090101769911;-123.988876769911

We ran out to see and there was a orange, red, faint green fire like ball that stood still for a few minutes.   Then the object started moving slowly to the left then stopped again for a few more minutes.   Then the object started moving to the right at a little more faster pace then it stopped again and shot straight up into the sky at an extreme rate.
