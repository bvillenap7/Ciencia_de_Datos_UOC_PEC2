Translucent white sphere shaped ball on with striation marks on it like that of a water.  ((NUFORC Note:  Scientific balloon??  PD));2018-07-11 19:00:00;2 hours 15 min;Viewed through a telescope, it appeared to be a translucent white sphere shaped ball on with striation marks on it like that of a water mellon.  The bottom was flat and contaned a rectangular shaped area that was centered directly below it.  It appeared to have some sort of propellers on it.  It was south east of our location at 7pm.   We traveled south about 30 miles and by 9pm it was directly above us.  The local news agency, ktvz, told me that they saw it in one of their weather cams but had no idea what it was.  A few other people reported it to ktvz as well.;44.4807;-121.2399
