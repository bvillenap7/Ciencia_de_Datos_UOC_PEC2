Giant orb object, low on the horizon flashing intermittently at exact intervals over approximately 10 miles.;2015-04-28 21:20:00;15 seconds;Giant orb object, low on the horizon flashing intermittently at exact intervals over approximately 10 miles. A buddy and I were driving home from Madras, south on US highway 97 when I (the passenger) saw a giant, bright gold/yellow colored orb flash very low in the sky/horizon.  This light flashed at exact intervals moving north, back toward Madras, about 10 miles away--this all happened in roughly 10 seconds.  My friend also saw the light flash a few times when he looked through the rear window of our truck, at its furthest point until it wasn't able to be seen. I have never seen anything like this and have absolutely no explanation what it could have been in this rural area of high desert farmland--I have driven this stretch of highway hundreds of times in early evening, during the night.  Again, this light was massive in size, like somebody turned on a giant floodlight, each flash equidistant and at exact intervals.  The amount of distance it moved in such a short span of time is unexplainable.;44.4807;-121.2399
