I was driving South on I5. This is my second sighting in Oregon. A few years a part. I later heard via the news that an identical UFO was seen on camera at Yellowstone.;42.4244;-123.0854

I love looking at the night sky and I'm pretty good at spotting satellites and shooting stars, but tonight it was a bright light in the sky just above the mountain behind me hovering back and forth slowly. It looked to be spinning in circles because it got dimmer then brighter as it appeared to turn . This continued long enough for me to run into the house and grab my girl and her nephew to come look, and they confirmed that it was definitely in the sky and strange. A few minutes go by and it looked like another light came up on it fast, they converged on each other, and headed downward at an angle towards the ground and they fell out of sight behind the mountain.  They fell from the sky FAST!  I have not seen anything since, and my eyes have been glued to the sky!;42.4244;-123.0854
