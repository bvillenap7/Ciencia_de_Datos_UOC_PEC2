This happened on 08/14/18**  I noticed what I thought was a satellite but it was not moving as a satellite should.  I observed it for a minute or so flitting in a pattern that an aircraft would not move.  It moved like I imagine an amateur drone user would.   I pointed it out to my husband who also witnessed the same pattern.  We called our girls outside, 13 & 12 years old, they also were confirming what we saw.   After about an hour, I called my parents and brother who live about 3000 feet due north of us and my brother also saw the same pattern. This was an object that looked like a bright star or satellite that moved in a pattern not consistent with a fixed wing or rotary aircraft for over an hour in the same general area.;45.3414;-121.9571
