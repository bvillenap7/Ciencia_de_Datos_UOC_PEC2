I noticed some lights out of my drivers side window, they were almost right above us. It was a little cloudy outside so all i could see was the lights, like they were right above the cloud cover.They were circles of lights and they were spining in opposite directions of each other and made up one big disk like shape. At first I thought that they were just some lights from town from an advertisement or something, but the more we drove through town we realised that the spinning lights were staying right above my car, off the the side, up in the sky.  I got scared and said that it was following us. My boyfriend said that there was nothing to worry about, but I was so scared that I  pulled over into a store parking lot, and of course there was noone else around that i could ask if they saw the same thing.  But as we sat there, I looked out my front window and it was right above us lingering in the clouds.  I got so scared I took off, and left town.  I was doing about 80mph and it was still following us.  My boyfriend said that he saw something black flying in front of it, but couldnt make out what it was.  It stopped following us as soon as there was no more cloud cover.  A lot of people ask me what kind of drugs I was on. and it hurts my feelings, because I KNOW what I saw and it WAS following my car. Hopefully someone else has had a similar experience and believes my story.;44.3904;-121.2371
