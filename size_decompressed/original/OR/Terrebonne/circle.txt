2 UFOs sighted above our back pasture...;2011-01-09 05:30:00;3 1/2 hours;2 UFOs sighted above our back pasture... At approximately 05:30am on 01/09/11 I woke up to a very bright light in the sky.  At first I thought it was a bright star then I noticed that it would move about in the sky almost shaky like, up down and side to side.  It appeared to have 3-4 lighted orange spikes off of it or orange light emitting from it. As I was watching the light, I noticed a second light in the trees near the ground. This light started to rise up out of the trees and when it got above the trees and I noticed it looked identical to the first light so I woke up my husband.  He saw both lights. I scrambled for my video camera.  As I was getting the camera my husband told me the second light “flew” up and over the house.  It was still dark at this time and I could not get my video camera to focus in on the object.  The object would also dim it’s lights when a plane would go over (we have an airport within 10 miles of our home) making it look like an ordinary star then it would brighten up again.   My husband, my mother and my father all saw the object and we video taped it for some time.  Then it was just gone.;44.3904;-121.2371
