A red, ribbon-like moving shape flying next to the butte in Terrebonne, OR.;2013-01-03 21:37:00;3 minutes;A red, ribbon-like moving shape flying next to the butte in Terrebonne, OR Driving north down a small residential road, I was the passenger and my friend was the driver.  She noticed a red light in the sky.  We stopped the car in the middle of the road and remained inside. She was immediately panicked.  I was not alarmed at first, thinking it was an airplane.  However, there was no noticeable solid shape to the craft, although a red ribbon-like shape light was spinning as the craft danced around the sky. When I say the craft danced around the sky, it looked as if it was not going in any particular direction, but just flying above us, moving in kind of a slow fashion towards the western part of the sky. As I turned to look at her in shock, and quite a bit of fear to this unknown flying light above us, she screamed as the light just vanished into thin air.  I quickly turned my head to look, the sky was clear. Whatever it was that we saw, was gone in a split second.  There were no obstructions, we looked at every direction.  It simply vanished.  I ruled out the fact that it was no typical airplane, helicopter, or any man-made flying ship because of the speed in which it disappeared, there was no evidence it was even there, not even a red light off in the distance.;44.3904;-121.2371
