Until 6 of them individually began moving in different directions.  They would move slow, then stop and remain stationary.  Then suddenly almost disappear, like a light being turned off for 10 seconds, then back on, still in it's same location.  When they would move, they'd curve: like S turns, they would stop, then hold still, move straight down slowly, then straight back up, hold still, move at angles.  I had to leave, so I'm unsure how long it continued, but we watched it for at least 15 minutes.  There were many stars in the sky that night, these half a dozen that we saw moving, blended in like all the rest, until they began moving, one by my one, unlike anything I'd ever seen. I wouldn't have believed it if I didn't see it. Witness 1- Myself: I've always thought that we're not alone- but until this night, I've never actually FELT like there was something else out there. Witness 2- A family Friend: She has always thought I was silly for thinking we were not alone. She is even more speechless about what we saw.  ** Without knowing what I had seen, my neighbor told me they saw blue lights in the sky and stars that were moving a few weeks back (which would've been on September 07, 2020- In Mill City OR- Same location as my sighting)  Neighbors-1 household Believer type-Mother 5 household members are non-believers.
