UFO OVER ONTARIO, OREGON.;2019-05-25 19:44:00;10 seconds;UFO OVER ONTARIO OREGON I had just left the state park north of Ontario, Oregon and was just crossing over I84 Highway when I noticed a cool cloud formation, I usually stop to take these kind of pics besides sunsets. I pulled off the side of the road and put my window down to take a picture of the cloud formation.  I got my window up and continued on my way into town and home.  When I got home and parked I looked at the picture and thought it looked cool.  I happen to notice a black dot on the left side in the picture.  I expanded the image and noticed it looked like a disc titled and facing my way when I had taken the picture.  I was excited to have captured this. Looks like a disc to me.  You be the judge.
