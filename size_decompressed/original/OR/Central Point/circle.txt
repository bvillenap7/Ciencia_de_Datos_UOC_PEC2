No less than 17 satellites all in a single line going from NW to SE.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-14 04:45:00;15 minutes;No less than 17 satellites all in a single line going from NW to SE. At approximately 0445 on Tuesday the 14th of April 2020 I was out having my morning coffee looking up at the moon and the Mars/Jupiter conjunction and noticed what I thought to be a satellite go from NW to SE just skimming past the handle of the big dipper.  To my surprise, there appears a second satellite shortly after following the same flight path.  I was shocked to see a 3rd and it appeared to have the same distance between each satellite.  I was astonished when I saw a 4th and then a 5th and kept watching to see no less than 17!!!!!  I'm a 60+ female who has served 20 years in the Air Force first as a Military Training Instructor, then worked for NATO, followed by Survival School at Fairchild and finished up as NCOIC of the Legal Office so I have had years of experience with watching aircraft and satellites.  I have never seen anything like this in my life.  Were these just satellites?;42.3902;-122.9177

It was moving across the night sky at a fast speed and in a straight line from east to west.  As I continued to watch it I realized that there were two thin rods slanted from the sides of the circular object.  There also seemed to be a perfect circular prism around this object and I realized that the brightness of the object seemed contained within this prism. I thought it was the International Space Station but when I checked the website it was nowhere near here.  I am certain that what I saw was not a plane, jet or helicopter. I have always lived near airports or military bases so I know what planes and jets look like. I am not sure if this was a UFO but it is definitely unlike anything I have experienced before.;42.3902;-122.9177
