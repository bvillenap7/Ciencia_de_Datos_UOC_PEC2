I saw a streak of blue/green light in night sky close to Central Point, Oregon on  9-13-2015 around 9pm.  It seemed close not like a falling star more like lighting  (but straight) and was unlike any kind of lighting I have ever seen.  There was no storm or rain just a clear starry night sky at the time. The streak was very bright in color and coming from the sky downward at a slanted angle.  I could see the straight blue/green light as a whole line at once and unlike a comet did not seem to have a larger front with a tail but uniformed in size from top to bottom.  There was no nose and was not above city lights so it was very bright and rather shocking at first site,  However, also rather pretty.  I just would like to know what it was I saw.  I believe it to be an unusual but explainable occurrence…I just don’t know what kind and I thought you might know. Thank You, J PS...when I say it was blue-green I don't mean it was mixed it was more green on the outsides and blue in the middle if that helps.;42.3902;-122.9177
