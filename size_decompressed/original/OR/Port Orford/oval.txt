Moves almost soundless (whispering sound like a distant sprinkler).  Moves very quickly horizontally at various altitudes.  Seems to orbit most of the time and randomly falls out of orbit at varying instances.   Other people report seeing strange lights in the sky but don't seem to be particularly intrigued by these phenomena.  Very peculiar.......   Wondering about cases elsewhere?;42.7568;-124.4904
