Strange incident in 1977;1977-10-25 19:30:00;5 min;Strange incident in 1977 On the night of 10/25/77 I was out side of our house sitting on a lawn chair with my husband and his friend. The kids were asleep early and we were just chatting. They went in side to get more parts for something they were working on and I saw it alone, but the next day the neighbor boy ask me if I had seen it he had also seen it and was looking for some one to validate his siting. There was a hill in between 2 other hills about 30 miles from us and I saw a bright light there on that middle hill, then the hill slowly raised into the sky and disapeared. The neighbor boy saw exactally what I did, we asked around but most people were afraid to commit even though we could tell they had seen something strange. There has never been a hill there again.  Over the years we have seen strange red lights and orbiting formations but nothing like the 77 incident. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is precise.
