We saw three silent silver colored disks which came from three different directions.  They zoomed in very fast ,at different times, instantly stopped,hovered above us (evenly spaced),  for about a minute and zoomed off together and were gone in a blink of an eye. We lost 4 to 5 hours somewhere and returned home. ((NUFORC Note:  This is one of three seemingly credible reports of overt sightings of a UFO by the same witness.  The witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  We have assigned an arbitrary date above.  PD));43.2341;-120.6363
