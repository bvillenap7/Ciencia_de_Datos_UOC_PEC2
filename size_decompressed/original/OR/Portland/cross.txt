The flying object looked like a cross, with the green lights overlapping the red lights.  The green lights on the object looked similar to the LED lights you see on car headlights.  The object was about 1.5 miles up in the sky.  The object did not make any jet or plane engine noise, and was hovering slowly.  It was completely silent.   When I noticed it I was at this position: 45.473362,-122.719876.   As a reference I could cover the flying object with my thumb which is about 0.75 cm.   There was an airplane northeast, about half a mile away from the flying object, but the airplane did not seem to be chasing the object.   The object seemed like it was hovering slowly above me so I ran to my car.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Unknown flying object sighting in Waterfront Park.;2020-02-21 19:50:00;30 minutes;Unknown flying object sighting in Waterfront Park. I was sitting on my porch with my partner when a ball of light started moving towards the right side of the sky.  At first it was slow and the light was bright white, beams of the same color seemed to come out of it through the back.  It kept moving to the right, stopped, and then started moving towards the left before disappearing from our sight.  It came back suddenly, it looked very similar to a star, but then the light suddenly faded into a blue/greenish hue - it quickly circled out, leaving a trail, and disappeared from our sight.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
