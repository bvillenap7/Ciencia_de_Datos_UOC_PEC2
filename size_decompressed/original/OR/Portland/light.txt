They appeared to be staggered about 7-10 of them low to the ground 500-1000ft.   It looked like they were moving very fast but started to disappear one after another right before my own eyes.   As I watch them leaving our dimension, I saw a  plane over head a lot higher in the sky than the objects I just witnessed.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

Their color was that of an amber colored street light but more intense. they moved slowly from my vantage point while I continued to walk home. As I stopped and watched to be sure of what I was seeing one disappeared then a miniute or so later another disappeared and so on for a couple of mins until they were gone . That same night I called the airport,the National guard, OMSI and a local news station (I don't remember which one). Heard back probably heliocopters which is total B.S. 'cause heliocopters don't fly like that.    Who knows? except that it aint just us in this chunk of space I'm pretty sure of that. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate source is anonymous.

Reminded me exactly of the 'phoenix lights' descriptions I saw on MSNBC yesterday. I saw 5 of the lights that were that orangeish streetlight colour but very bright. by the time I'd walked up the road home and showed my father there were only 3 left then they soon winked out. I called the airport and national guard base and of course they were probably weather ballons according to them. I knew it was not from this planet that is why I wrote it down that night and seeing that show I said hey I saw some of those. So this is probably a little late but what the hell, it can't hurt.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

No strobe or running light apparent. Object observed 2129-2130 hours 3 August 1998 viewing east along Washington Street from SW corner of Broadway and Washington in Portland OR.  Weather clear ca. 70 degrees F. light breeze from north.  Object was very bright blue-white light, steady illumination (no variation in luminance or color).  Object was size of small pea at the end of my arm.   When I first noticed it, I thought it was an especially bright satellite given its steady  tracking characteristics,  but the object suddenly disappeared when it reached a position straight on from my observation point, and I also am not aware of many satellites in easterly to westerly orbits!  As I could see no evidence of running lights or strobe, and I could hear no noise during the sighting or for two minutes after the object disappeared.  It also did not appear to be in usual flight approach or departure lanes for PDX.   I decided to report sighting as unknown. Track:  appeared to be very high.  About 4 degrees below a very bright star or planet (slightly less bright than the moving object), and about 80 deg. above horizon.  Went through 3--5 deg. of arc in about 40 seconds.  Sudden winkout at 90 degrees azimuth. I felt strange after seeing this.  I thought I heard a couple behind me say Oh, another sighting! but no way did I want to talk to anyone about what I saw at the moment.  Needless to say, I debated a long time before deciding to report this. I am a professional archaeologist  trained in photointerpretation and physical observation techniques.  On two other occasions I have seen odd high altitude night lights behaving in ways not characteristic of aircraft or satellites, but have not reported those.  I also witnessed one of the Blue Book daylight unknowns in summer 1954 in Alcoa, Tennessee, along with several of my friends.   I am interested professionally and personally in UFO subject.  Would like to know if there were other observations of reported event.  Or explanations!;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

Bright light hanging in sky then zig-zagging downward and disappearing.;1999-12-21 17:00:00;3min.;Bright light hanging in sky then zig-zagging downward and disappearing. My wife was driving down the highway and noticed a very bright light in the sky (near Mt.Hood, I think), that was not moving. As there were aircraft in the area, she expected it to move, but it didn't. It was a very clear afternoon, with the mountains in clear view, and no stars in sight. After watching the light for a minute or so, she decided to stop and try to figure out what it was,shortly after she stopped it zigg-zagged downward and disappeared. As she is not a UFO believer, she is hesitant to call this a UFO sighting, but she was excited and confused by what she saw.

I was driving home on Scholls Ferry Rd. traveling South West (or there abouts as this is a very twisty, winding stretch of road going down the long side of a ridge) wwhen out of no where above and directly in front of me appeared a bright green ball of light desending at a very rapid rate of speed as if it where falling. It appeared shortly then it disseapered. It did not have a tail like most space junk or comets or falling Stars.  It was just this very fast, falling ball of green light. All so in March, In Salem,Or. My Wife and I saw an Orange ball of light approach us from the East.  WE watched it for at least two or three minutes before my  wife started to call here sister on our cell phone and as she did so the orange light slowly began to change it's corse and began moving toward the south and eventually moved into a bank of clouds. I only report this now as I can't help but notice all of the reports about green, and orange and white lights. This I can not leave out.  When my wife and I where married in 1994 in Los Vegas, Nevada we took a side trip to the North Rim of the Grand Canyon.  Unforunatly, because of our time of deparchure and the distance from Utah to the North Rim, It was getting dusk just as we arrived. As we headed back up the long plautue North in the dark pines suddenly a very bright white light pasted us through the trees going in the opposite direction of our travel. There was no sound, and when I looked in the rear veiw mirror I saw nothing but darkness. I looked back forward just in time to see my wife looking over her left shoulder through the back window of our rental car and then she looked at me breifly. We did not discuss this occurance untill we had returned to Oregon becuase it was so weird but we both remeber it distinctively along with each others unspoken responses.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

I saw a object that at first looked like a typical satelight, small bright object moving at a steady rate from south to North.  It was about the size of a star in the sky, and just about as bright, a little hazy.  Airliners were visible at lower levels traveling slower than the light.  It still looked like a satelight then it made a sweeping turn to the East, Satelight do not make turns, and faded out of site.  The object appeard to be above 80,000 ft. because of the hazy look to the light.  There were no blinking lights, no flashing lights, just a steady bright light.  It was moving faster than the airliners heading north to Seattle and considerably above them.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

It looked similar to Moon light breaking through a cloud, except there were three lights (and a fourth more faint). The three brightest lights were shaped in a triangle pattern and where not moving. They were about an extended arms length apart (like one hand on the 10 and the other on the 2 of a clock).  The fourth fainter light was off to one side from our position. They were almost overhead, possibly 15-20 degrees looking down, if looking directly overhead was 0 degress. Suddenly all four lights came together in the middle, they merged, moved down very slightly and then went out. The fourth light seemed to be just a hair behind the other lights as they merged together.  The movement happened in about 1 second. The lights seemed to be shining down, but it is difficult to tell as the clouds were obscuring them from a direct sighting.

I was on my way to the corner of 6th and W. Burnside Street to meet with someone when I seen a bright light out of the corner of my eye.  Upon looking directly at the object I could see that it was twice as bright as the moon and about the same size as the currently half-moon that is in the south eastern sky.  The object was in the north western sky and too bright to see any details.  It was circular in shape.  I stood there looking at it and noticed that it never moved and made no sound.  It also never changed color.  There was no flickering of light, fading or otherwise.  I then thought to go back to the apartment and grab my camera.  When I returned, the object was gone.  On the corner looking one block up at a three story building, the object appeared about 2 to 3 inches above the building.  The streets were very busy with vehicular and pedestrian traffic but no one took notice of the object.  I originally seen it looking between two buildings and then went around the corner to the next street up to get a better view.  It was then that I thought to grab my camera.  While looking at it there was nothing attached to the object or coming from it.  There was construction in the area and the lights from the cranes were smaller and not as bright.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
What I thought was venus was moving !;2001-02-09 20:00:00;1 hour;What I thought was venus was moving ! As I was watching tv I noticed a very bright star in the sky. I assumed it was a planet as it is usually where we see what we believe to be venus (to the west) It was so bright though, I thought I would make a note of where it was in the sky, and see if it would move. For the first half hour or so, it remained stationary. After that however, I started to notice it slowly moving to another part of the sky. It was very suttle to someone who might just be looking up, but it was definitely moving. It didn't seem to be of conventional origin for the mear fact that it moved so slowly. I was watching it by myself until my wife came in the room. She usually poo-poo's the idea of UFO's but when she saw it and saw it was moving, it kind of spooked her. We had binoculars handy so we watched it and saw a better view of the object. It was very bright, and every so often would change to part red. Sometimes more red than white. Now we knew it wasn't venus- plus it had moved so far. It took a little over an hour for the object to finally disappear over the mountain. When I first viewed the object through the binoculars, it appeared as a huge ball of light. I could not see any indication that it was a conventional craft. I am not an expert, and have only seen something peculiar one other time, but this one stumps both my wife and I. Please let me know if someone else saw this object or somehow this can be explained away. I am a believer, and for all I know, this thing has been sitting there before and I just didn't take the time to watch it. I would be very interested in knowing if others saw it.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

I saw two objects just after sunset as I was driving home.At first, they appeared to be airplanes, although they seemed to join together and form one large, hovering craft, about 2000 feet up.  Then, after about ten minutes, they split again. One advanced northward, and the other remained in a hover mode, perhaps advancing slightly northward.  I then saw a very small light leave the remaining craft, and it fluttered downward erratically, kind of like a spark. As I arrived home, this second craft advanced forward again, and I noticed it was shaped somewhat like a plane, but all the lighting was white and steady.  There were no blinking red and greens that are normally seen on the wing and tail sections of a plane. As I watched it slowly move northward, it appeared not to have a body or shape.  It was as if lights were arrayed on an invisible craft.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

Sighting of lights over willamette river in Portland, OR Saturday 1/12/02 @ 4:10pm near two rainbows;2002-01-12 16:10:00;1 minute;Sighting of lights over willamette river in Portland, OR Saturday 1/12/02 @ 4:10pm near two rainbows I have never in my life seen anything like I saw today on my way to a movie in NW Portland. We were travelling north on Macadam Boulevard right near the industrial area on the west bank of the willamette river when I looked up and noticed two rainbows that broke off mid way up in the sky as above them loomed a thick cloud formation that covered most of the eastern sky. While examining the rainbows my girlfriend (who was driving at the moment) noticed little lights which were floating either in front of or within the cloud formation. The lights, looked EXACTLY like stars but it was 4:10pm in the afternoon and they appeared to be in front of the clouds. There were 6-10 lights all hovering and moving both in formation and separately (I definitely counted 6 I could see at one given time while my girlfriend claimed to see as many as 10 at one given time). These were not like any planes I have ever seen as they remained stationary and were able to move back and forth in relation to one another with surprising speed and no need for turning radii. One moved in the northern direction, then stopped on a dime, hovered for a while and then returned in the direction it originally came from. They moved quite quickly and seemed quite agile.  The group of lights occupied no more than 35 degrees of the sky  horizontally and all appeared around the same altitude (guesstimate of 200-300 feet high) Neither one of us could tell the size or distance of the lights as they appeared as little more than pin pricks of light but we both agreed that they appeared to be somewhat close and the way they moved only heightened that sensation. If I had to guess I would say they were no more than 2-3 football fields away. This is my first UFO experience and I hope other people were looking in the direction of the rainbows and can back up our story. Did anybody else see this? I have no idea what they were but it was one of the most amazing things I have ever seen.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

Subject: Something I saw last night My name is (name deleted) and I live in the South West hills of Portland (Mountain Park). I want to report something that I saw last night (1-16-02). I was walking my dog heading east on our street at about 10:05 P.M. I was looking across the south east part of Portland towards Mt. Hood when I saw a red fuzzy ball of light streaking across in front of the mountain. I thought it was a fighter jet or helicopter, until it just stopped in mid air. I was dumbfounded so I stopped in my tracks and watched. It sat in the same place for about 2 minutes and then streaked a crossed the sky headed to the southwest gaining altitude at a amazing rate. It had no exhaust trail or light trail. It made no noise.  I have witnessed military jet fighters powering up to break the sound bearer and this was moving much faster.  My wife said I was nuts and it was just an airplane.  I don't think it was. Let me know if anyone else saw it please! (A follow up e-mail with the witness on Friday the 18th of January 2002, revieled further information...) I told my neighbor (who has lived in the same house for 20 years) about the sighting and he told me that I wasn't the first person to see the red light in the neighborhood.  According to him, as many as 6 people have seen a red fuzzy light over the last 20 years.  I asked him if he was one of those people and he declined to answer. He then excused himself and hurried back into his house. (An exact location of where this object was seen is presently being sought through a follow up investigation and some reseach into whether other aircraft were in the area at the time will be conducted to see if other witness can be located.  NUFORC will be notified of any future information.  Eric Byler - Oregon UFO Research.) ((NUFORC Note:  Our gratitude to Eric Byler and Oregon UFO Research for submitting the report.

Oregon UFO Review Case:  Object releases dark orbs in Portland skies...photographed.;2002-06-21 16:42:00;75 minutes;Object releases dark orbs in Portland skies...photographed. Friday afternoon this witness reports getting out of his truck after getting home from work and seeing an object in the sky. Witness writes...I stood at the end of the drive and watched as it held it's position for 20 minutes. At that point I ran into the house and grabbed my digital camera. I ran back out to the end of the drive and it was still there in the same position. My neighbor across the street was out in her front yard and I called to her to come look at the object. I asked her if she saw something above the tree line. She replied Yes! and asked What is that? I replied I have no idea but I am not going to miss an opportunity to photograph it! I then proceeded to take the pictures I am sending you. My neighbor noticed that it was not round and that it looked like it had a wobble in it's movement or rotation. I started to take more pictures when my wife pulled in to the drive. I asked her if see saw the object and she said Yes. She also asked what it was. At this time I looked back up at the object and it was starting to move, very slowly, to the East. The object moved to the east against the wind. There was no noise and as he was looking through the lens of his camera, he noticed the object was ejecting small black objects to the north west...seven total...and then it began to move again. The couple went in the house and returned 45 minutes later to leave for dinner and watched the object from the car. As we drove across the hill towards Lake Oswego I noticed that I could still see the object and it still looked to be the same size. After dinner I made a quick scan of the sky and could not find the object the witness wrote. It was estimated that the object was at around 10,000 feet because of scale to passing aircraft in the PDX pattern and angle to horizon. Update: June 26, 2002... OUFOR team member and investigator Cameron Johnson followed up this sighting with some phone calls to the NOAA in Portland regarding weather balloons as well as a local police department for other sighting reports. He found that standard weather balloons used in Oregon are 3 to 4 feet in diameter and are taupe (tan) or red in color. The only place that the balloons are released in Oregon is in Salem and, during daylight savings time are released between 4 and 5 p.m. The balloon telemetry recorded the drift being to the South East from Salem. When asked about the possibility of a balloon hanging at a fixed position for a long period of time, he said that it was not possible because the balloons are in a constant state of ascent and the telemetry corroborated his statement. He gave a official statement that it could not have been a NOAA balloon. The attempt at finding other sighting reports from the police department yielded no results. Special thanks to OUFOR investigator Cameron Johnson for his follow up work on this sighting.

At first glance I thought I was seeing a shooting star, but I then realized this light was moving below the clouds.  The speed was slower than a shooting star, but much faster than any aircraft I have ever known.  I heard no sound either.  Did anyone else in the Pacific NW see this?

Bright, White light moving North from South, Below the Moon.;2002-08-03 04:18:00;30 Seconds;Bright, White light moving North from South, Below the Moon. Looking at the moon (To the East) noticed a bright light moving slowly from the South towards the North about ten degrees below the moon and about the same distance to the south of the moon, moving Northerly gaining brightness for about 15 seconds, and moving very slowly.  Then just as it was when it came into view, began to loose brightnes...until there was nothing left to see.  It moved very little in a Northerly direction, maybe a degree at most.  It left no trail, did not come back into view and only changed color in the spectrum of white light.  Very Bright, white light, and in Size was twice as big a Jupiter to the naked eye.   Brighter than the cresent Moon.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
In a night sky 5 silver/blue lights circled in a circle, joined at the center, repeated the event  & then the joined lights went out.;2002-08-03 22:05:00;About 3 minutes;In a night sky 5 silver/blue lights circled in a circle, joined at the center, repeated the event  & then the joined lights went out. I opened my back door to put a dog out and immediately noticed that five silver/blue gray lights were circling above in the sky. I don't know how long it had been occurring but I watched them for about thee minutes before the event stopped. The lights seemed to circle independently, each moving in the circle while moving  but not in a locked position each seemed an independent light darting about with the others and together forming a rough circle for a time and then at the same time joining together at the center.  They did not form a perfectly round center light when they joined that is each round light seemed to remain separate and  touch the others at the center, forming a larger irregular center light .  Then they went  back out again to form the circle and repeated this process over and over.  At the end they joined in the center and, after maybe 10-15 seconds, the lights just went out. At the end the lights seemed to be more like one light, more totally merged into one.   I live near an airport but the lights were not like any I have ever seen and did not behave like the lights that the airport uses.  I have only once before experienced anything that I could remotely call a UFO sighting, four and a half years ago from this same house, but that time it was more like a bright star type light, two of them darting and then coming together before the light went out when they last joined.  This time the lights were very soft and diffuse looking, there were more of them, and they behaved very differently.  I'm thrilled to have seen it and wish my neighbor was not away on a camping trip!

Observed what appeared to be a dim satellite make a U-turn, then accelerate to an unbelievable speed.;2002-10-16 21:00:00;15 Seconds;Observed what appeared to be a dim satellite make a U-turn, then accelerate to an unbelievable speed. At approximately 9:00 PM on the evening of October 16th in Portland Oregon I observed what I took at the time as a satellite moving in a Northwest direction. One of my hobbies is Astronomy so I often look up to the heavens. I've seen the Space Station, Mir, Space Shuttles, Sky Lab and countless Satellites. This Satellite was different though. It had all the characteristics of being a Satellite, such as altitude, flying in a straight line and speed equivalent to that of a Satellite. What I though odd about this object was that is was quite dim, which made it hard to visually track. I wondered why, being it was so high in the sky, didn't reflect the sun off of it? It most definitely had the altitude for the reflection. I kept watching it for about 12 seconds and then it did something I have never in my life seen a Satellite, or anything else do, it made a U-turn, angled itself upward at about a 40 degree angle, maintained it's speed for 4 more seconds and then it accelerated to a speed I don't think you could put in miles-per-hour. All I saw was a streak leave the area where it was cruising at the speed of a Satellite. Get's you to thinking, doesn't it? ((NUFORC Note:  If the estimate of the direction is correct, the object traveling to the northwest could not have been a satellite.  Altitude is impossible to estimate accurately without the aid of triangulation.   PD));45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Red light above Portland;2003-01-05 18:15:00;couple minutes;Red light above Portland I noticed a red light at night (naked eye) coming from the east of downtown Portland about 20 degrees above the horizon heading west. The speed and size of this light was the same as when ISS & Shuttle are docked together, but this light was red and did not fade away. This red light flickered abnormally in intensity as a whole. The event ended when it went behind the hills and I lost sight.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

At the same time be both pointed out what at first looked exactly like a star, but this bright object was moving at a constant rate of speed.  I thought at first that it was a jet, but it was much too high in the sky to be so. It traveled from north to south and was not blinking like lights on an airplane would be. The object looked exactly like the other stars we were gazing upon.  We watched this object travel through the sky - it did not appear to increase nor decrease its speed - until it faded from our view as it came within proximity of another star still well above the horizon.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

Around 10 or 11 pm, we saw a very bright light moving from the south to the north. It was moving at a constant rate of speed, just like a satellite. I told my friend to take a look at the unusally bright satellite. (I constantly observe satellites and the ISS, and constantly tell my friends to look up and watch with me as they pass.) Then as it passed over head it made an unusally abrupt right turn and headed east. This object moved with a constant rate of speed and a constant rate of magnitude of bright light. Usually satellites fade as they move away. This object was twice as bright as venus would be and it made absolutely no sound.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

Really didn't see any significant movement and not totally sure i didn't just see a grouping of stars.  It was about 45 degrees and dead north of Portland.

Bright shining object over Porland OR;2003-09-22 17:30:00;Less than 1 minute;Bright shining object over Porland OR As i was leaving Portland heading south on the Amtrak train looking out the window to the southwest, I noticed a bright silver light high in the sky (to the southwest).  At first I thought it was a refraction of the setting sunlight on an imperfection in the window glass of the train, but as i changed my perspective it became obvious that I was looking at something very high in altitude, directly over the hills south of Portland.  Whether it was in motion or not I couldnt tell due to the motion of the train and its apparent distance. If it was moving, it was travelling very slowly. To me it appeared to be still..but as i said, i was in a moving train.  It was close enough to tell that it was NOT an airplane, but too far and to bright to make out any shape.  Just looked like a silver object brightly reflecting the sun.  I was watching it, trying to figure out if it could be a balloon, sattelite, or some other type of high altitude craft, when it just dissapeared. Not faded, not accellerated and left...just gone. The oddest thing was that it seemed to stop reflecting sunlight and turn a creamy orange-white color just an instant before it vanished. Ive seen ufo's before, i think...but not in broad daylight over a major metro area there is no way in hell Im the only one that saw this thing.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

Yellow/orange light in evening sky followed by military jet activity;2003-11-06 19:30:00;1 minute;Yellow/orange light in evening sky followed by military jet activity I was unloading my car at my apartment and I noticed a gold/orangey light in the sky, I was facing South. It was really bright, which caught my attention because normally Portland at night is really cloudy and you can't see much. Anyway, I noticed the object and I got an eerie feeling, for lack of a better word. It was just one light, no blinking. It came from the west, not terribly fast, then it seemed to slow down, but was still moving. No sound. There is lots of airplane activity around where I live, so usually it would be no big deal. I know what the commercial planes look like at night, and it wasn't one I am used to seeing. Just when I was ready to brush it off as a weird plane the object began to move erratically, jerking in strange ways. I turned around and shut the trunk of the car, which caused me to face north and then I turned back around and it was gone. I got a weird feeling and started walking back to the apartment. Just as I reached the door I heard military jets do a fly over, it was weird though because I couldn't see them when I just saw the light a moment ago. I have no idea if it was just one plane or what but it was really loud. I then went inside my apartment and told my husband, who seemed unimpressed. Also, NOT SURE on the time, I approximated.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

At around 2 am, I arose from bed and looked outside.  In less that a minute I saw a extremely bright yellow light (roughly circular in shape) travel from the north and dissappear behind some trees.  There was no sound, and it was moving at an extremely rapid speed.  I would estimate the total time the object was in my view to be no more than 3-5 seconds.  This is the second time a strange object has been seen in this area.  About 12 years ago, a fast moving red light shot across the sky moving west to east during the late evening.

My spouse and I were walking in the neighborhood looking up at the full moon. Our attention was caught by a very bright light which at first I thought was a satelite. However, we both were surprised at the size (a VERY large star) and speed of the satelite. We then thought maybe it was a jet, but there were no blinking lights and no sound. We were watching and wondering when the light began to change to red and then began to fade quickly and then disappeared. We watched the sky a bit longer and saw two planes minutes after the sighting. One passed by the moon similiar to the unidentified flying object which provided us with a good comparison and it looked nothing like the UFO.

It is a mostly clear night, with some faint, fast moving low clouds that passed near the two lights. At first, the clouds gave the appearce of movement, however, the lights appeared to remain stationary in relation to a nearby telephone pole.  I looked over to my mother and brother, to see if they were looking at what I was seeing. One of the objects moved to the down and to the right of their orriginal position.

I suspected that a dark thin cloud had gone in front of them, even though I could see a few spotty small clouds in the vicinity that were visiable, this one was not. So I went in, got my binoculars, viewed the area to see to very dim lights/stars in the location that I saw the two lights/stars. They were still there, but no cloud was in sight.

It was much brighter than the brighest star or planet in the sky. I looked to be at about 10,000 to 15,000 feet in altitude. Much too low to be a satelite. I had my girlfriend grab the binoculars. I could see no navgational lights on the craft. When I first spotted the object it was directly South of our house. When it got to about 15 degrees above the horizon, from my vantage point, it disappeared, as it entered the shadow of the earth. So it was reflecting light from the sun and was very shiny.

Three reddish lights seen over Pearl District of Portland, OR;2005-05-01 00:45:00;5+ minutes;Three reddish lights seen over Pearl District of Portland, OR Witness reported sighting to MUFON (per Oregon State Director for MUFON).  Witness states he was in the Pearl District of Portland and on his way home from work, when he saw a well-dressed man walking his dog in a park. The man was looking up at the sky with an expression of wonder and concern, and he turned to the reporting witness and said, There's three strange lights up in the sky.  Reporting witness continues: . . . and when I stopped and looked sure enough right where he pointed there they were. Three dim but definite reddish lights, two were right above each other, the third above the two and off to the upper right.  They resembled stars in their size and over the course of several minutes the upper two would fade and dim out, then reappear at intervals, independent of each other.  Finally they faded for good with the upper right one moving off to the west in the process, the other one just did a stationary fade leaving the bottom light which then faded in and out as well then vanished. They seemed to be a high altitude but as I had no way of establishing scale it's impossible to tell. The gentleman expresses his gratitude at my stopping and telling him what I was seeing as it mirrored his own perceptions and relieved him as he was concerned that he was 'seeing things'. He also told me that he had been watching them for about 5 minutes before I appeared and they had seemed both lower and brighter.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

Six Red Lights;2006-04-29 23:55:00;3-5 minutes;Six Red Lights My location at this time was overlooking downtown Portland facing NE (Freemont bridge) to SE (Ross Island bridge). Venus was up in the southern sky and there were no sighting opportunities for the international space station. I could not see any military jets, commercial planes, or helicopters (they would have the flashing or strobe lights in the night sky). Conditions were light hazy skies to the horizons with views of constellations above. I saw four red lights moving north to south at a slow speed. The lights traveled in pairs of two. In each pair, one red light angled higher than the other spaced by a degree or two, followed by a larger space (up to 5 degrees), and then followed by the other pair of two. These two pairs of lights did not break their formation and continued south until they vanished from sight. They were as bright as Venus and seem to be around 10 thousand feet. As I was viewing these four objects come and go another pair of two red lights were slowing moving north to south above in or around downtown Portland. These two did seem to slow down couple times or at least move to the west. I viewed this pair for a couple minutes before vanishing in the southern horizon.  There were no objects or lights emitted, no sound, no vapor trail, did not change colors. I did take two pictures which shows one red light in the night time sky and the other shows one red light behind the leaves a of tree.

I was walking up the stairwell in my dorm, and noticed a strange bright white light between two of the tall identicle apartment buildings on the riverfront of downtown Portlad. At first I thought it was a bright star, but there are very few stars visible in Portland, and it was far too bright. I then though that it was maybe just a plane, since the flight pattern goes that way, but the light wasn't moving. Slowly I noticed it move. It took about three minutes for it to slowly move behind the left apartment building. I then decided to walk up a floor or two, to see if I could see it since it hid high up on the building. I caught a glimpse of it again, and yet again it hid. I did this a couple more times and it kept hiding. It . Finally, It dissapeared or went behind the  building and I wasn't able to catch a glimpse of it anymore. I ran and grabbed two of my friends. I returned with them, about two minutes after losing sight, and there it was back where it originally was not even  moving. My friends and I sat and watched it for about two minutes. It sat there motionless for about a minute. Then slowly started moving and gaining little speed as it traveled to the left again. It then began to dim. It dimmed completely before being blocked by the building. I had this sort of weird feeling that what ever it was knew it was being watched, so it kept hiding. I think bringing the two other friends convinced it to vanish. The apartment buildings are about a half a mile from my dorm, so we decided to walk over there, but saw nothing.  While the bright light was going on, I also noticed a pulsating red light flying in a circle over and over to the right of the it, but didn't think too much about it.  While walking back from checking out the apartment area, I spotted a red lighted craft, maybe a plane or satelight flying above. Whatever it was it was fast, and high in the air. It made a total pass of the sky within 2-3 minutes or so. Later on the night, me and one of the other witnesses spotted one of the pulsating red lights where the bright white light was. it was fling in irregular patterns. sharply left and right and up and down.

Bright, Disappearing Object in Portland Night-Sky;2007-05-16 22:00:00;10 seconds;Bright, Disappearing Object in Portland Night-Sky Hi, Mr. Davenport,  Last night, as I lay in bed looking at the stars out of a window, I saw a bright, white light high in the sky.  First I thought it must be Jupiter or Venus, but then I saw that it was drifting slowly northward.  A big, bright light moving to the north: this could not have been a planet or a bright star.  Some might suggest that I saw an airplane I can only say that all of the airplanes I’ve seen flying at night typically have flickering lights spaced apart from one another on each wing, whereas the object last night was one solid, extremely luminous ball of light.  Others might suggest that it was a satellite, but all of the satellites I have seen in my life have not been nearly so luminous as this object.  Most importantly, neither hypothesis can explain the sudden disappearance of the object.  I have been curious about UFOs all of my life, but this was only the second time I’ve ever seen anything anomalous (the first time was insignificant: probably just a balloon).  For a while I stared out my window, hoping it would come back again.  But (alas!) it was gone.  I only saw it for about 10 seconds before it vanished.  Perhaps someone else in the Portland area saw it, too.  I want to go to McMinnville this weekend to hear you speak, but I don’t have any way to get there.  Greyhound doesn’t go out there on weekends.  Perhaps next time.  That is all.  Thank you for your time and the fine work you do.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

Given the fact that i live close to the Portland International Airport I thought it could be an airplane but it was moving too fast.  After it was almost out of my line of sight it seemed to start behaving strangely and moving up and down.  This led me to believe that there could be two craft given the strange motion, i know there was at least one.   The sighting took maybe 30 seconds before i could no longer see it.  I thought this could be a satellite but given its erratic behavior i do not believe this.   This is the first time i have ever seen a UFO but my mother saw one in 1972.

PD));2008-11-23 18:00:00;at least 40 minutes;3 bright white lights in traingular formation with no noticable sound and in seemingly fixed position seen in SE Portland Oregon area Driving south bound on I-205 we saw three bright white lights in a triangular formation.  When we first noticed them we were in the area of Powell bvld.  They were stationary and very low and no sound that we could detect. We also saw a helicopter that seemed to be pretty close to the light at the triangal tip.  The helicopter left and shortly after we saw an airplane. the third light became invisible to us but the two stayed in exact formation but seemed to be traveling southbound.  When we arrived to our destination, (Oregon City) the two lights were still in what appeared to be exact distance from each other as when we first saw them.  They seemed to be stationary again for some time.  I went outside to look at them a few times for the next fifteen minutes and the last time I checked they appeared to be on the move again but still in formation. What is interesting is that there were other people on the freeway who had to see them.  The helicopter and plane certainly did but no report on news or in the morning paper.  Even if they were blimps or something explainable, it would seem that lots of people would have called in.

Point of light traveling at high altitude with intervals of flaring.;2009-01-09 21:30:00;30 min;Point of light traveling at high altitude with intervals of flaring. Under a clear, cloudless sky I observed a point of orange-ish light traveling south to north almost directly overhead Portland, Oregon.  My eyes would not otherwise have been distracted to peer skyward had it not been for a flaring effect I noticed from this object moving from the south.  I compare this object to a star of magnitude +2 and when it didn't flare it appeared identical to a star. The best approximation I can describe this flaring is to equate it with the firing of air in a hot air balloon at high altitude.  The flaring had colors of red/orange/white and would last about ten seconds, then cease and the point of light would reappear.  The flaring occurred in intervals of about two to three minutes and I observed about five of these events.  The object continued to move south to north at a steady rate but abruptly began traveling northeast as it passed over the Vancouver, WA area.  I continued observing this object for 20 minutes and the flaring continued to occur at regular intervals throughout the period of my observation.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

Was not able to observe during object departure but moments ago while writing this i went to look again and it is gone.  We observed a few aircraft in the normal PDX approach vectors and there could be no mistake this was not an airplane, helicopter, or balloon.  We also compared the object to the many visible stars and the object clearly stood out. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Two cops observed four strange lights over Portland, OR, and one of the lights appeared to drip a molten substance.;2009-03-20 23:30:00;2-3 minutes;Two cops observed four strange lights over Portland, OR and one of the lights appeared to drip a molten substance. I was working as a police officer for the City of Portland, OR on March 30, 2009. PPB officers usually ride alone in patrol cars but it was the week of Spring Break and night-shift officers, like myself, were asked to pair up to enforce city curfew ordinances that night. At approximately 21:10 hours, my partner and I were dispatched to cover another officer who was responding to the report of a domestic disturbance. The problem address was located either three or four houses north from the intersection of N Moore Ave/N Jarrett St. Portland, OR 97217 (Latitude: 45.565156, Longitude: -122.667971). After we were done assisting the primary officer on that call (~23:30), we remained outside our cars to discuss the night’s events to that point. As we were talking, I glanced to the southwest and noticed two gleaming lights, flying in formation, moving in an east-southeasterly direction. I pointed out the lights to my partner and we walked south 15 or so yards to the NW corner of the intersection. We stood there and continued to watch the lights. The two lights were visible against thick, high clouds. It was not raining, there was no noticeable wind, and no stars were visible. The lights were a pale streetlight-amber, the lights shown steadily, and about were approximately three to four times the diameter of the brightest/largest star I have ever seen in the night sky. The height of the clouds helped me estimate the sources of the lights were no larger than a small shuttle bus. There were no aircraft navigation strobes or safety beacons visible on or near the two light sources. My partner and I both commented we could not hear any sound coming from the lights. The two objects were moving at a speed I judged to be slower than a typical propeller aircraft could travel. We assumed if the light sources were helicopters we were close enough to hear the blades of their rotors and see additional lights on the aircraft. Aircraft was audible in the distance to the northeast. Portland International Airport is only a few miles from that area. However, it struck me as odd that the lights were flying eastbound since almost all air traffic approaches the airport from the south or east. My partner is a captain in the Army National Guard and is familiar with military aircraft. He had no idea what we were watching. The two lights were flying in a loose formation, at the same altitude but one slightly ahead of the other. The northernmost light was leading. The lights’ relative proximity to one another was also out of the ordinary. I estimated the source of each light was approximately 25’ in diameter. With those dimensions, I would guess the distance between the two lights was 150-250 yards. It is very unusual to see aircraft flying that near to one another over the city. The lights began to turn toward the south in a lazy arc. The leading light took a wider turn than the other. As they did so, we were surprised to see another pair of lights following the first pair. The second pair of lights was at the same altitude, moving at the same speed, and flying in the same general formation as the first pair. The distance between the two pairs of lights was hard to estimate but I would guess there was a half-mile or so between the two pairs of lights. My partner had received orders he was deploying to Iraq in a few weeks and had bought a video camera in preparation for his departure. He had brought the camcorder to work that night, and he ran back to our patrol car to retrieve it. He returned and began filming the lights as the first two lights began to disappear out of view behind some tall trees. The second pair of lights followed the same course and began to make the same turn to the south when something odd began to happen. The southern light of the second pair slowed noticeably and began to flicker. The random tempo and change in luminosity of the flickering reminded me of a lit candle in a slight breeze. The flickering had been going on for about eight seconds or so when we both saw something begin to “drip,” multiple times, from the bottom of the object. The molten substance was the same color as the light and it dimmed then sputtered out as it fell from its source. The speed at which the incandescent substance fell from light indicated to me it had significant mass. For example, a drip fell at a greater rate than that of a fizzling firework ember. My eyes traveled downward in-line with some of the drips. I saw the material reignite briefly although it was significantly dimmer. Overall, I estimated it would have taken the material ten seconds to fall to the ground. That intuitive estimate of altitude helped me get a bearing on how far away the lights were from us. I suppose the nearest light passed within 15-25 blocks south of our location. My partner stated military aircraft are forbidden to drop flares over populated areas in order to prevent fires. No unexplainable fires were reported in that neighborhood that evening. The flickering light eventually stabilized and began glowing steadily again as it continued moving to the south-southeast. I estimate we watched the lights for the better part of two minutes. The non-flickering lights did not move toward or away from the flickering light.  That led me to think the flicking light was not in distress. I did not get the opportunity to view the footage my partner filmed. He promised me he would get me a copy of the raw video but failed to do so before being shipped out to the Middle East. I imagine it looks like all the other night UFO videos in that it depicts a strange light with a black background. I do not know if he caught the flickering and dripping on video. I have never seen anything else in my life that I would call a UFO.  My partner and I discussed what we had seen for the rest of the evening and were unable to come up with a plausible explanation for what we had witnessed.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
bright white light moving erratically leaving light trails;2009-07-24 03:00:00;12 minutes;bright white light moving erratically leaving light trails Last night I saw a very bright white light in the SSE sky.  It appeared to be moving or jumping, so I took my binoculars out to observe. The light was very high in the sky and moved erratically in all directions while staying in one general area.  The object left light trails, so it looked like light squiggles. The object continued to move like this for about 10 minutes, when it started to move further away and became fainter. It was moving erratically the entire time until it disappeared into the distance.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
The three bright lights over Tanasbourne, Oregon;2009-09-08 21:00:00;15 seconds;The three bright lights over Tanasbourne, Oregon I was on my way home from dragon boat practice when I looked up to see 3 bright lights moving over my home in Tanasbourne about the same altitude as planes. I thought I was seeing things. But after watching enough ufo shows they told you what to do.  I stopped dead in my tracks listend for sounds, other likes around the three bright ones and nothing out of the ordinary.  Until one of the lights broke formation behind the trees, but I didn't want to lose sight of the other two over my head.  One was following the other then started to go dark.  As for the other dark as well, then gone no sight.  I tried to find them.  This was my first light show and loved it.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
On the morning of Wednesday April 28 I was staying at a friend's house in SW portland and we had been up all night having a conversatio;2010-04-28 05:30:00;30 minutes +/-;On the morning of Wednesday April 28, I was staying at a friend's house in SW portland and we had been up all night having a conversation.  We were standing in his kitchen looking out the sliding glass door to the upper balcony.  His deck looks east over the Willamette, and his house sits very high up, near John's Landing and Macadam.  Because his house sits at the top of the viewpoint it offers a full view of Ross Island and directly parallel from the deck is the north end of Oaks Bottom Natural Reservation.  This is where the whole incident took place it did not happen in the sky. The objects appeared about a half mile away from us, from the opposite bank, the east side, of the river. Before we noticed the lights, we were having a good conversation talking about the state of the world, spirituality, and sharing personal experiences.  I had gotten to the subject of recent UFO sighting I've had, and I was explaining to him that I really feel that we can be making efforts to reach out and contact off world visitors, as individuals, and as communities or small groups.  I was telling him about a sighting I had near Lake Cushman in Washington, where I was staying at a friends cabin.  This particular sighting happened one night a few months prior, when I went out to the deck of the cabin overlooking the lake.  Strangely enough, when I went out there the sky was clear but nothing unusual was visible.  I closed my eyes and began to envision a light rising up out of the lake, and I put out my thoughts that I wish to have a contact and I want to see something, then when I opened my eyes out in the distance on one of the hills was a white light which had appeared while my! eyes were closed! It pulsed irregularly with no apparent pattern, and the brightness of the pulses also were changing.  This is a sighting in Washington months ago so I won't go into detail here.  But it's important to describe this because it is interconnected with all of my sightings I've had recently, which all seem to be the same 'type of craft'. SO, while I was describing this to my friend, I had been looking out his window at lights which were flashing and changing colors, but I hadn't noticed consciously.  My friend interrupted me from my descriptions and said, What are those lights out there?  I then noticed we were looking at something unusual.  I started to list things off and I thought at first we were looking at a traffic intersection, was there an accident?  Were we looking at ambulance lights or was there construction going on out there?  But my friend pointed out the lights were not coming from our side of the river, they weren't that close.  These lights were coming from across the river!  We went out to the balcony and our eyes adjusted to the darkness, it was just before sun rise so it was pretty dark out.  We could clearly see the outline of the river and Ross Island, and the tree line and bank of the east side where Oaks Bottom sits. The lights were all very close together, I would say there was an area of 100-200 feet which these lights stuck together and hovered around very close to ground level.  The lights didn't rise up above the tree line so they stayed about 50-100 feet above the ground and the river.  They moved slightly at first from side to side, and then towards the end of the sighting they did move north about a quarter mile before disappearing right before our eyes. To describe the lights without seeing them for yourself does not give justice to the intensity of what we saw! I could not stop saying, This is so beautiful! Have you ever seen something so amazing and beautiful before!  I was touched by the sheer sight of it all.  But also I was going through phases of many emotions and physical feelings during this sighting.  At first I was skeptical, uncertain of the area we were viewing, that it could be something unexplainable.  But as it got brighter out I could see my friend was right, it was an area where there are no buildings, no roads, and no public access.  The lights we saw are unlike anything I've really seen before.  Even in science fiction movies, these lights just were so unique I can't really describe it perfectly. There were lots of colors, and the lights seemed to change rapidly in shape, size, color, and brightness. The lights would stay 'lit' for a split-second to a full few seconds.  And the lights were not lights on an object - this is very important to understand - the UFO was a group of lights with no other objects associated.  I could clearly see, for the entire duration, the larger lights would pulsate, glow, and vibrate for a few seconds.  Then, upon shrinking and disappearing, it would be followed by dozens of colorful sparkles and twinkles and yet more bright white-blue or golden pulses.  The number of individual pulses and appearances would number in the hundreds.  Because for the whole duration these twinkling pulsating orbs of light would be constantly changing and it was hard to say whether we were observing a collective of dozens of individual objects, or if this was some kind of vortex which many objects were popping in and out of, or if maybe it was all one big transparent object which dozens of changing lights appearing all over it. We were out there for a while and continued to watch these lights with much excitement and wonder, for the next 20-30 minutes I assume.  The sun came up not long after we stepped outside, and the lights continued pulsing even though it was then light out and we could clearly see no vehicles, people, objects, or anything at all! The lights were appearing from out of nowhere, they were literally phasing into our visual perception either from another dimension, or from a band of light or vibration which we cannot visually see - or both. I recall my friend describing that he felt very warm through the entire experience, I too did feel like I was having hot-flashes, but I at the peak of the experience, I felt as if electricity was surging through my body, and I felt like I was having a transmission of thought with these objects. So many feelings went through me. But not one tiny amount of fear was felt - I felt completely secure and in fact I felt very blissful and loving energy. I recall that there were tears streaming down my cheeks and I couldn't help but cry because the love and joy I was feeling was SO intense!  I felt that these lights were supporting us, all of humanity, and they care dearly for our well-being and our planet too. We are not alone and we live in a vast universe. But we do not have anything to fear, if we feel fear and are in a negative place within, then we are going to attract such experiences perhaps unconsciously. We must remain grounded, centered, and composed. We didn't get any pictures or footage at all unfortunately, but this sighting was more than a usual UFO sighting, to me it was a CE5 - a close encounter of the fifth kind characterized by close bilateral communication, and experiencing physical effects from the encounter. I can send a picture of where the sighting took place using an aerial of the area from google maps - if this is something that would be useful then let me know. I can be contacted via phone or e-mail for further questions and details.  I am an artist so I have been drawing what I saw but truly the whole incident was so dynamic a simple picture doesn't really show the incredible animation of these objects. I am personally making efforts to pursue more contacts and I feel very confident now that things are just beginning and I am very excited for the near future events to come.  I know I have my own personal perception of what happened and because i've experienced 'supernatural' or unusual events all my life, I am very confident in trusting my intuition on these matters.  Contact with these higher dimensional beings requires an open heart, and pure intent.  We must be raising our vibration as individuals, communities, and a planet - there is much hope for us here in our quest to heal and clean our home, these beings are here for multiple reasons, some may be a part of our earth too, some may be here to assist us or our planets or the sun. We will find out more as we open up and begin to shift into the new paradigm. There is much more I could attribute to this sighting, as in the last 2 weeks I've had yet another sighting but of a smaller implication. I've seen ufos in the sky but my sightings are happening on ground level as well simultaneously in some cases. I am pursuing more contacts with an open heart and mind. Thought and meditation techniques are very helpful and I believe the way to go for pursuing a communication with dimensional beings. Please contact me if you feel compelled to, I feel there is much more to come very soon!;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

Almost like a goldfish swimming in a tank.  Not fast moving.  The movements were very subtle.  It was too high to be any known aircraft and too low to be a star.  The object was situated about northwest of the position of the moon around 10:05pm PST.  While I was staring at it I did happen to see a satellite passing through.  The satellite was moving at a constant speed and one direction.  This object would move then stop for a moment then started moving again.  It did this several times.  Also a bright blue flash occurred around the same time the two objects came close to each other.  I had to grab my cousin to confirm what I was seeing.

Large neon blueish bright white light flying and hovering in all directions in NE Portland.;2011-07-22 21:50:00;30 seconds;Large neon blueish bright white light flying and hovering in all directions in NE Portland. Three of us were packing our car for a camping trip in SE Portland and we witnessed a neon blueish bright white light hovering in the sky to the north anywhere from 5 to 15 miles.       It moved to the left very quickly, continued hovering at the same altitude.  Then very quickly moved to the right. It continued back and forth in an almost pendulum manor.  It descended towards the horizon to where we almost couldn't see it through the trees in our back yard.  I could still see it though, hovering and moving large distances back and forth until it jumped back up in the sky and hovered some more.  It continued to move back and forth, up and down until it eventually decended at a sideways steady speed and disappeared from our view.  Our 3 neighbors heard us yelling and came outside and saw it all happening as well.  We caught a small glimpse of video.  It will be online very soon.

Very clear night, and I see what looks like a satellite moving in the skies maybe a few hundred miles away.  It was moving at a typical speed of a satellite.   Then all of a sudden, it shoots straight up FAST, leaving a brilliant streak behind it, then disappears.  It reminded me of a shooting star as it took off, except this was flying up and out of our atmosphere and I clearly saw the ball of light prior to it flying up.

From Tigard, Oregon, looking east towards Mt. Hood just after dusk, I myself notice what appeared to be 2 stars, bluish in color, about the same magnitude as one of the stars in orions belt moving in unison to eachother (one slightly higher in altitude than the other) from north to south. Also, as they moved south they also were climbing in altitude, so from my perspective they were traveling upward diagnally.. Keeping the same distance apart from eachother.  These lights were solid points of light.  I'm an avid amature astronomer and right away I knew it was unusual so I told my girlfriend and my other good friend to look at what I was seeing.  We watched these lights ascend diagnally to the south for another 10 seconds and then these lights simultaneously faded out gradually until no longer visible. Again, they were blue solid points of light climbing diagnally one just above the other. These started about 20 degrees off the horison and ended at about 40 degr! ees.

His vision isn't as good as mine and he asked me to see if the light had any red lights or was blinking like an airplane. I moved to where he was and saw a moving light heading from NW to SE.  I then stepped away from the fire to get a clearer look.  As soon as I locked on the light, it seemed to slow up and get smaller.  It continued to slow nearly to a stop and the light diminished until it disappeared entirely in front of my eyes.  It was looked the way a star would look if it were receding.

Bright orange light in the sky, moves fast and disappears.;2012-05-14 21:35:00;3 minutes;Bright orange light in the sky, moves fast and disappears. I got off work tonight May 14th, 2012 at around 9:35pm and was driving north, when to my left up ahead, I saw a very bright, big orange light in the sky. I knew it wasn't a star, and it couldn't be a plane, it was much too big and too bright.  Planes aren't usually orange. It seemed to be flying pretty low, right over the city.  I continued to drive north and pulled over a few times to look at it and try to keep it in view.  It was moving in the opposite directon as me, so it was pretty hard to keep up with it.  I saw one of my students waiting at a bus stop and stopped to talk to him, but I was looking up the sky the whole time.  He asked what I was looking at, I told him there was a strange light in the sky so he looked up also.  By then, it started to move a lot faster and gained altitude until it literally disappeared.  I looked no bigger than a distant star when I last saw it, then I lost it in the sky.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Bright, amber, shimmering light in sky above Southeast Portland;2012-05-27 21:24:00;3 to 4 minutes;Bright, amber, shimmering light in sky above Southeast Portland At 9:24 PM from the residential east facing slope of Mt. Tabor in Portland, OR I witnessed a light in the sky located South/Southeast approximately between Mt. Tabor and Mt. Scott just below the scattered cloud layer that behaved like nothing I have ever witnessed in the sky before.  I was outside of the house preparing to move my car into the driveway from the street where it was parked.  As I was getting into my car I was now facing south, and before sitting down into the car I noticed a bright, amber, shimmering light in the sky comparable in size and intensity to a street light viewed at 1-2 blocks away.  What drew my attention is that the light was so bright and at this point it was stationary in the sky.  To be clear, there is frequent air traffic over Mt Tabor depending upon flight arrival patterns at Portland International Airport (PDX), so we are very accustomed to witnessing bright jet landing lights and how they appear/behave in the night sky.  Wh! at I was now observing was definitely not any form of conventional aircraft, and was definitely not jet landing or helicopter lights.  Approximately 3 seconds after I began observing the light it very smoothly and rapidly moved from south to north in a straight line toward me covering approximately an eighth of a mile in the sky, though the distances are hard to gauge with the clouds as my only reference point in the sky.  There was no jet noise or any other sound.  The light stopped and hovered stationary again, very bright and clearly visible.  At this point I called my family members that were still in our house via my cell phone from the street to come out and look at this light, because I did not want to lose sight of it.  The light continued to hover for approximately 1-2 minutes with clouds blowing by above the light while the light remained stationary.  By now I had one witness with me observing the light.  Now, the light moved again in the same manner to the east b! y another approximate eighth to one quarter of a mile where it! stopped again, and remained stationary in the sky.  A third witness had now arrived.  We observed the light for another 30 seconds to 1 minute as it hovered stationary in the sky with clouds blowing around it as it sat in a small patch of open sky.  The light must have gained altitude during it’s last movement, because at the end of this period the clouds began to then move in front of the light, became thicker causing the light to fade behind them.  From this point the cloud cover thickened in this area of the sky.  Three of us watched the sky for another 15 minutes but never saw the light again.  I don’t think air traffic control at PDX was routing planes over southeast Portland last night during this event because I did not see or hear any jets while observing this light.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

Extremely bright object in southern sky. - Portland.;2012-11-25 16:50:00;3-4 minutes;Extremely bright object in southern sky. - Portland. I was driving home, heading south on my street, just about to reach my residence.  Off in the distance, to the south, about 30 degrees above the horizon, I saw an *extremely* brilliant seemingly stationary object in the sky.  Distance unknown.  It was white, incredibly bright, and pulsed or twinkled...not unlike a bright light through a lens, or a distant twinkling star...except this thing was huge compared to what a star or planet looks like, and many magnitudes brighter...and it was still mostly daylight out.  I cannot emphasize enough the brightness of this object.  It was akin to Venus at its brightest on a clear night in the country, only it appeared so much larger than Venus ever does.  Without being able to gauge the distance, I have no idea as to its actual size.  It could have been anywhere from a mile away to several dozen miles away, but from my point of view it was about half the size of a dime held at arm’s length. As I approached the spot I always use to turn around, so I can park facing north, I stopped and watched the object for maybe 2 more minutes.  At no time, did it move or change intensity.  Even though it seemed way too bright, I kind of expected it to just be an airplane coming up over the horizon, directly at me, and that after a few moments the perspective would change and the light would look different.  I then realized I was sitting parked in the middle of the road, so I proceeded to turn around as usual, all the while keeping an eye on the object either directly or through a mirror.  When parked, now facing north, I continued to watch the still stationary object in my driver’s side mirror for up to another 30 seconds or so.  I then got out to take a better look, and in the time it takes me to open my door, the object apparently had vanished.  I did not directly witness it vanish, but I had only taken my eye off of it for a split second.  If it had been an airplane, comin! g up over the horizon, making it appear stationary, then I still would have been able to see the plane itself after the perspective of the light changed.  But there was nothing in the sky there.  Nothing coming or going...left or right, away or towards.  I also did not hear any airplanes or helicopters.  I continued to watch that spot and surrounding areas for several more minutes and did not see anything at all in the sky, anomalous objects or otherwise. There was a gentleman waiting at a bus stop about 50+ feet away.  We noticed each other looking southward, but being shy I did not go over and speak with him.  I wish I had now.

Approx. 11 pm, A friend and I were walking on Se Morrison on 28th when We noticed a hovering orange light in the sky slowly descending;2012-12-21 23:00:00;5 minutes;Approx. 11 pm, A friend and I were walking on Se Morrison on 28th when we noticed a hovering orange light in the sky slowly descending towards the Earth.  It had a glowing aura to it.  A smaller red glowing ball pulled out very closely from the orange ball, and spun around it like a spiral for for several seconds.   The orange ball, in a slow, floating pace, looked like it was heading towards land, but it could have easily dissapeared beyond the horizon. at one moment the ball slowly wobbled back and forth.  No sound was heard.   My friend and I both agreed that it was a unusual, unidentified object.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Moving object resembling a star makes sweeping turn before disappearing.;2013-05-04 22:00:00;15 seconds;Moving object resembling a star makes sweeping turn before disappearing. Shortly After 10pm on the night of 5/4/13 two friends and I were enjoying a warm night relaxing on the patio at my home.  It was a clear night with a handful of constellations clearly visible. While looking up at the stars I noticed what appeared to be a light, similar in size and brightness to a star moving across the sky.  It travelled at a speed faster than any plane I have ever witnessed, yet slower than a shooting star.  I alerted my two friends to what I was seeing and they two witnessed this light moving across the sky. We observed this light for approximately 10 seconds and assumed it was a satellite, or perhaps some sort of comet.  However, the light then made a sharp right turn, while maintaining its velocity.  In my estimation it turned approximately 80 degrees to the right in a matter of seconds.  The arc of the objects turn resembled the curving angle of a hockey stick. Approximately 5 seconds after making its turn the object disappeared as if the light was suddenly turned off. The object we witnessed left no visible trail and appeared to be out of the atmosphere.  Its appearance can best be described as a bright star. When I first noticed the object it was travelling west by southwest before turning south.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Bright ball of light in the sky over Portland.;2013-06-02 23:00:00;~5 minutes;Bright ball of light in the sky over Portland. Sunday night I was in my backyard smoking a cigarette when I saw a bright light through the tree's to the west.  The object seemed like a plane at first until it came into full view. It was not a plane. It traveled from west to northeast. The object was flying about as low as commercial planes that take off from PDX (Portland international airport), (low enough to hear the engine and see the wings and flashing lights if it were a plane)  This ball of light had no flashing lights, no wings and made no sound. It was the brightest light I've ever seen in the sky at night.  I couldn't take my eyes off of it,  I watched it fly from the Hillsboro area, over the west hills to Portland when I lost sight of it. During the the time I was watching it, it did not leave a trail, it did not change brightness, make any erratic movements, or change speed. I have lived in Oregon for about 20 years.  In that time I have seen one similar object, in broad daylight about 15 miles from this sighting. When I was a child, I spent a lot of time on the Colorado river at the Aha Quin resort (trailer park/air strip).  I saw fighter jets doing tactical maneuvers over the desert, practicing dog fights, shooting flares at each other.  An awesome sight. I see satellite's drifting through space almost nightly. I've seen the afterburner of fighter jets in the night sky. I have seen meteors/shooting stars. I have no logical explanation of what I saw Sunday night June, 2, 2013.  Or in the afternoon about 5 years ago.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
White light hovering place, disappeared and reappeared three times, and changed shapes.;2013-07-06 21:30:00;10 minutes;White light hovering place, disappeared and reappeared three times, and changed shapes. My fiance and I walked out to the Columbia River in North Portland to view the sunset, as we do on an almost nightly basis.   We gazed west, looking across the Interstate Bridge that connects Portland, Ore. to Vancouver, Wash. We noticed a bright, round light that appeared to be several miles away.  The light hovered in one spot for several seconds and then disappeared.  My fiance said, It must have disappeared behind a cloud.  However, there were no clouds in the sky that night.  A few seconds later the light reappeared slightly to the right of its original location.  It then hovered in the same spot for several seconds before disappearing for the second time.   A few seconds later it reappeared just to the right of its last position. Here's where it got weird. The light remained in one spot without moving and then started to grow from a round, bright light into a long, cylindrical shape, and began shining brighter.  It then appeared there was a line in the middle and the two sides grew outward but were still connected.  It also seemed to be rotating in place. At this time a fighter jet scrambled from Portland International Airport and began flying toward the object.   The now oblong light continued hovering and rotating in place before finally dimming and disappearing for good.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

Strange constant set of lights moving East to West over inner SE portland skyline;2013-12-06 22:40:00;1 minute;Strange constant set of lights moving East to West over inner SE portland skyline On my balcony at 10:40pm in SE Portland I watched as a light formation caught my eye directly above my head headed east to west.  My balcony faces toward the west and this craft(s) was coming from the east and headed west, I was only able to view after it was over my buildings eve, but through the entire western sky over the west hills of Portland. It was unlike any aircraft I have seen in over 4 years of living in this apartment.  The lights were constant in brightness and duration with no flashes or blinking, not like any plane, jet, helicopter or thing I have seen.  If you could imagine for idea of position of the lights, the face of a clock one light was at 12 o'clock and one was in the 5 o'clock position.  They stayed in these positions relative to one another the entire time I saw them. They moved on a path not like any aircraft I have seen, moving east to west, slightly dropping to the south before moving back to the north as it was traveling east to west the whole time.  With solid white-yellow lights the entire time.  Many aircraft travel over view from my balcony from the 3rd floor, news and law enforcement helicopters private, freight, and commercial planes and this was not the same.  It had no noise or sound relative to anything I have observed.  It lasted about 45 seconds to 1 minute total.  I think it was about 1000'-1500' in the sky based on all other helicopters and planes/jets I view on a daily basis.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

Intense white lights followed by red and blue lights;2014-06-26 00:25:00;30-45 seconds;Intense white lights followed by red and blue lights I was sitting at my computer with the window open when I noticed what I thought was a blue helicopter light, but it quickly grabbed my complete attention with its strange movements.  The light moved across the skyline at extremely high speed, assuming the object was as distant as I think it was.  It was also incredibly smooth, gliding effortlessly north to south.  Every 8 seconds or so, the radiant blue light became an intense white light for about 1 second, and then became a dull red before becoming an intense blue again.  This happened probably 4 times before the object dipped below the some apartments to the east of me. 	I've never seen something that I couldn't explain like this before and thought I should describe it.  My girlfriend also witnessed this UFO and agrees that it could not have been any aircraft the two of us are familiar with.  I couldn't really see a craft shape very well, but she feels that when it went from the white light, which was VERY bright like search lights, back to red and then blue, it kind of seemed like the object was rotating.  We opened our back door I couldn't hear any damn thing, but my girlfriend thinks she heard it whining, again unlike any aircraft we understand.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Bright white light races west to east over Portland, OR.;2014-07-15 21:45:00;8-10 seconds;Bright white light races west to east over Portland, OR. Tuesday night, at about 9:45 PM, July 15, 2014, in Southeast Portland, Oregon, as stars and satellites began twinkling, I saw a bright white light race across the sky from west to east. The brightness was like an Iridium flare from a satellite, only it was much larger in radius that a satellite appears to our eyes.  I do not think it was a satellite because it was moving so fast and because the glow was so much larger than satellite.  I do not think it was an airplane or helicopter either, because the speed was way too fast, there were no other lights besides the consistent glow, and the single white light was larger than any light I've seen on an airplane at night.   Also there was no sound. If it had been in aircraft and if it had been flying that fast and presumably low enough to produce a light that large, then I expect I would've heard some noise but there was none.   The flight path was west to east over highway 26 in Southeast Portland (Powell Blvd.)  Many local aircraft fly this route but none fly it as fast as this: approximately 8 seconds from west horizon to east horizon.   I can think of no category to fit the proper description of this light. I do not know what it is, but I'm pretty sure I know what it is not.  And that's why I want to share this information here with you.  Thank you;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

Sporadic movement: circular, straight, zig-zag.  Star-like, no blinking lights. Cont. movement and short periods of complete stillness.;2015-08-06 04:00:00;40 minutes;Sporadic movement  circular, straight, zig-zag.  Star-like, no blinking lights.  Cont. movement and short periods of complete stillness. Beginning around 3:55, I went outside for a cigarette and as is my custom, craned my neck staring at the sky.  Spotted the popular three star triangle, and the waning moon to its left. Viewing from the SW to SE skies, directly above me.  In Homestead neighborhood right next to OHSU hospital. It started with one object, I assumed was a star shifting its light.  Then it began to move sporadically, circling and zig-zagging... slowly drifting upwards and to the right.  I used the moon as a still-object to make sure I wasn't seeing things. The longer I watched it, the more it moved.  No blinking or flashing lights.  Quick, sporadic movements in short spurts sometimes in longer spurts.  Sometimes it grew still. Around twenty minutes into the sighting, while moving in circular motion, a smaller light spat out from it and vanished. I also find it interesting that during this 40 minute time period I saw two very large meteors and several much smaller ones. I report four objects, as there were two other much, much dimmer objects nearby moving in similar fashion. The third appeared after one of the large meteors, zig-zagged a small amount, and then moved on much like an airplane straight across the sky. The other three sightings were not as spectacular as the first, which remained... even after I ran back upstairs to grab my camera. Of course, since the light is the size of a star it was impossible to capture on my digital camera. Also worth mentioning is that last night, my roommate (who also witnessed this sighting) and I were driving home and saw what can only be described as a carousel-like ship.   Rotating slowly and moving slowly, with alternating white lights fading in and out.  They were not blinking, were not airplane beacons and were not red or green. Just white.  Rotating, or spinning, and moving across the sky in a diagonal manner. I am hesitant to label this immediately as a UFO, as it could very well be a drone.  However, due to the strange optical lights, fading alternately and after doing a few hours of research on drones and their lightings, I found that most drones have stationary or flashing lights much like airplanes... not this gentle, soft fading white lights in alternating fashion. And lastly, on the fourth of July during fireworks, I also saw three star-like objects much like tonight's sighting: sporadic movement and quickly disappearing.  These sightings lasted mere seconds, unlike tonight's sighting in which the first object remained for 40+ minutes. In conclusion, tonight's sighting of the continuous object with sporadic movement: spat out a smaller light that vanished.  A few times very vague trails with its quicker movements.  Wish I had binoculars or a telescope.  Will invest as I seem to be sighting more and more UFOs lately.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

Multiple sightings of bright white orbs that sometimes flashed brightly.;2016-04-01 20:55:00;30 minutes;Multiple sightings of bright white orbs that sometimes flashed brightly. At roughly 8:55pm, Friday, April 1st, 2016, I was standing in my backyard looking up at Polaris to the north and Orion to the S/SW, admiring the clear sky and beautiful weather of the evening.  Suddenly, I noticed a very bright and solid light originating from just to the right of the star Saiph, in the Orion constellation.  The direction of travel was S/SW to N/NE. It was travelling quickly enough to be thought of as a low flying plane, only there were no position or navigation lights or even a strobe light to be seen.  Just a perfectly solid bright white light that did not change in shape or luminosity as it changed its position in the sky.  There was no sound at all. Quite surprisingly, it looked as if the light was drifting ever so slightly to the east, in the same way a gliding bird might be moved by wind currents.  This took the object directly above me.  There it slightly paused for about 1 second as it changed direction and moved in a very straight line directly to the East.  I called my wife and we both watched the light, which continued to make no sound and show no other lighting other than the constant bright white light, until it got smaller and smaller and disappeared into the distance. About 10 minutes later, I returned to the backyard with my Sony A7000 fitted with a 55-210 zoom lens, set to maximum zoom.  Within one minute I saw a faint object flying directly South to North, exactly from where the original sighting began by Orion.  I recorded video as I watched the dim object suddenly grow in brightness (and apparent size, but hard to know if this was just a function the increased glow).  The object was constantly in and out of focus, as the Autofocus struggled to keep up. Again, about 10 minutes later, I returned to the backyard…this time with the camera set to manual infinity focus…and I saw a small faint object moving from the North/Northeast toward the Southeast.  I started recording and called my wife to come back out.  I had no tripod with me.  The object all but disappeared and had been blindly pointing the camera, by hand, at the blank sky where I had roughly last seen it…when suddenly, it flashed in brightness and we could see it rapidly “expand” and “contract” after each flash.  Most flashes were very bright, but others were more subtle and undulating.  This did not last long. Perhaps one minute.  This last sighting occurred in the same portion of sky that the initial object had disappeared in to.  I continued to watch and record the sky, but it never flashed again, and I saw no other objects in any other portion of the sky. I have video of the last two sightings.  The last sighting is the best quality due to the manual infinity focus, but they both lacked a tripod so it is unfortunately very shaky.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

Lights in the Portland sky with up to six lights in the sky and then the front one in the formation would take off to N.;2017-06-28 22:00:00;>30 minutes;Lights in the Portland sky with up to six lights in the sky and then the front one in the formation would take off to the north of the sky.  Three lights did this with one staying constant.   Then black hawk helicopter landed on downtown Portland building federal building then took off with bright search light towards light.  Then it was joined by another helicopter that gained altitude towards the light.  Black hawk came back landed again on building and took off again.   All of a sudden, lights reappeared in formation just to break up again.   I do have video of this as well along with my brother's video. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he corrected the date.  He sounded to us to be quite sincere about the alleged incident.  PD));45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
White light moving very quickly low on the horizon with military helicopter following.;2017-10-04 20:54:00;1 minute;White light moving very quickly low on the horizon with military helicopter following. My husband and I were watching tv when we heard a helicopter.  Within a minute or so it got very loud and the windows started to rattle.  It was obviously a military helicopter flying low.  We have experienced this on occasion, but never have the windows rattled like this instance. My husband and I looked at each other, jumped up and ran outside, looking north.  It was a clear night and an almost full moon, which was in the eastern sky.  What made this encounter interesting enough to report was not just the helicopter.   We are somewhat in the flight path of PDX and have planes flying over, so I know how fast they go.  When we went out, the helicopter was just flying over our house in a NNW direction.  In front of it, also flying NNW, was a small bright white light -- low on the horizon and flying VERY fast.  No sound could be heard other than the helicopter. Interestingly, there were two airplanes flying south higher then the light and the helicopter.  They had typical airplane lights and followed the normal flight pattern we usually see from planes flying over. Again, what was noteworthy about this experience was the speed and low altitude at which the white light was traveling, plus the military helicopter following it (I don't know if I would say pursuing it).  I don't know if the light was ET, but we would definitely call it a UFO because of the nature of the encounter.  Maybe something military?;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

They stayed close to each other.   It was clear that they weren't moving because there were other lights from planes moving behind the two lights.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
There are sightings of three lights, seen at different times.;2017-12-10 00:30:00;1:00 minute;There are sightings of three lights, seen at different times. I saw three UFO's last night, 12/9/2017 (early morning actually).  I am not sure what time it was when we saw the first two.  What I observed was a bright light, North of our house moving West to East.  At first, I thought it might have been the International Space Station (ISS).  I opened our front door and ask my girlfriend's daughter to come out.  I was in the doorway for 45 sec. to a minute.  She came out and the first UFO had vanished and I thought I should still have been able to see it.  When I looked again, in about the same position in the sky, there was another bright light moving at about the same speed, altitude, etc.  We watched it for a few seconds and it disappeared.  The two UFO's had been reflecting light from over the horizon and when they entered the Earth's shadow they could no longer be seen.  They had no lights on them. I was out on the front porch  a few hours later about 5:30 a.m.  The view from the porch is mostly to the North and East.  I looked up at the Moon and saw what I thought was a bright large planet close to the Moon's position, then I noticed the object was moving from South to North.  Again, my first thought was that it was a satellite.  I watched it for about 15 to 20 seconds and all of the sudden, it shot off, at a mind boggling speed, to the Southwest at about a 300 to 310 degree angle from the direction that it had been moving.  I had one of those Wow!! moments.  It disappeared quickly.  After it made the turn, I only saw it for maybe two seconds.  I think it had been reflecting light from the Moon and just disappeared into shadow as it changed direction.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
3 balls of light appear in the sky of out nowhere, hover, and than fly away.;2018-04-11 20:00:00;4 seconds;3 balls of light appear in the sky of out nowhere, hover, and than fly away. I filmed a time lapse over the course of a few hours, and after zooming into the video I noticed that approximitelly 3 objects appeared out of nowhere in the sky (balls of light).  You can see the airplanes in the sky flying by (very quickly) but these objects are moving very slowly,  and almost seeming to hover for a little bit.  They separate and fly away, still much slower than the airplanes you can see. Here is a link to a clip I posted online:  https://streamable.com/yy23q ((NUFORC Note:  We have viewed the video, which does indeed show three seemingly anomalous lights, moving apparently across the nighttime sky quite slowly.  Moreover, they appear to be moving in a different direction from the direction that low-altitude aircraft are moving, so the objects probably are not conventional aircraft.  We do not know what they are.  PD));45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Five lights in airplane-like formation, but no airplane body is visible.;2019-06-15 18:00:00;2-3 minutes;Five lights in airplane-like formation, but no airplane body is visible. UFO sighting Summer 2019  I was walking in my neighborhood with my boyfriend. He was ahead of me and turned around to talk to me and something caught his eye over my right shoulder. I turned to look and I saw five lights (4 white lights and 1 red light) in the air flying directly over the houses on my street. These five lights were in (what I am going to call) a formation that suggested they should have been attached to a passenger airplane.  The lights came from the east and flew low over the houses on my street. They were very close to me but there was no sound and I could tell that they were not coming from a commercially available drone, or any other drone-device that I know of. The space between the lights, in which I would have expected to see the body of an airplane, was empty. There was no visible structure holding these lights in their relative formation. I could see the sky and mountains behind them.  The lights flew past me from east to west and then turned in unison toward the northwest and flew over another city before disappearing into the distance. When I finally looked at my boyfriend to get his reaction, he was just staring at the spot the lights disappeared. I asked him “Did you see what I saw?” and he responded by saying, “Where was the plane?”  At that point we talked about what he both saw and agreed that we saw the same thing. We agreed that for lack of a better explanation, we had seen an invisible passenger airplane, or something pretending to be one.

Orange low flying orb.;2020-05-15 21:30:00;10 seconds;Orange low flying orb Roommate and I were eating a late dinner together when we spotted an orange ball of light flying low above the trees through the window. We’re unsure how far away it was, but it appeared to move in front of 3 radio towers, so possible a mile or so. Object was a bright orange light, orb in shape. It descended at a quick but steady pace into the trees and temporarily out of sight, maintaining the same elevation and moving in a smooth, non-linear manner. The first slope was gentle and the light was steady, not like a descending flare. It had no other lights visible. The object returned about five minutes later and was visible in the tree line before disappearing again. There was no sound and it was too small to be a traditional aircraft. We feel we would have seen multiple blinking lights, especially if it were flying that low. This is the second time we’ve seen this object. Upon looking at YouTube videos, this looks almost exactly like videos of orange ball UF! O sightings.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Bright color changing object visible across a large field of sky and exhibiting non-ballistic movement;2020-07-19 23:10:00;2 minutes + 10 minutes;Bright color changing object visible across a large field of sky and exhibiting non-ballistic movement My family of four was out in a deserted rural location to see Comet NEOWISE. I am a professional analyst and investigator with some law enforcement background and a lifelong interest in astronomy and space.  My wife grew up on Kauai and has had a variety of managerial and administrative positions.  My two children, daughter age 12 and son age 10 were also present.  The elevation at the location was approximately 1400'.  We had an unobstructed view of the sky from West-North-West to North-East.  We saw a bright light coming into view from the west, approximately 10 degrees above the horizon.  It was approximately 5 times brighter than the brightest visible star.  I thought at first it was an aircraft and we all were looking at it because of the brightness.  We then saw it exhibit some non-ballistic motion it was speeding up and then rapidly slowing to a stop, sometimes abruptly jumping up or down 2 degrees from its base course, and jinking around as it proceeded generally eastward.  I had a pair of 10-22 x 50 binoculars (to see the comet) and was able to get the light in view.  It was jinking around enough that its motion, combined with the binocular motion, made it too blurry to see any shape.  When I was watching it magnified it started to pulse the brightness and change color we saw the brightness vary by about 33% up and down, and the colors shift from white to red, blue green and purple in no particular order.  We tracked the object across our entire field of view, which took about 2 minutes.  We also saw one plane in the sky on a northward path (likely a Portland to Seattle flight) which made a stark contrast to the object as the plane had distinctly separate lights on the wingtips, did not change color, and was nowhere near as bright.  As the object was nearing the eastern limit of our view, my wife and daughter saw 4 more objects in a line that started changing color and brightening as the one object we were observing approached.  I was able to see 3 of the four from my location with the binoculars.  None of them were as bright - they were about the same brightness as the nearby starfield.  They did not move during the next 10 minutes.  They also displayed multiple colors, however only white, red and blue.  The brightness did not vary much.  Due to the lack of motion and different visibility profile, I could not personally confirm if they were other objects or distorted stars.  It is not possible to get a good estimate of distance on a light in the sky without reference points and knowledge of the object, but my best guess is given the brightness and comparing it to the plane we did see it was in the atmosphere at least 20 miles away.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Saw light round object hovering.;2020-08-01 00:00:00;30-40 seconds;Saw light round object hovering. My wife and I were looking up at the night sky towards the West when she spotted object flying fast not in straight line move towards the North and disappear.  Then all of a sudden in the West was a round Bright light that was on Hoover’s to the North and then blacked out and was gone.  We waited little bit longer.  And what seemed to be a shooting star with a tail went fast down from north to south west from us but it seemed so close and just disappeared.  I hope someone else saw these?;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
A group of 4, then 6 floating, silent amber steady-glowing lights moving around one another before disappearing one at a time.;2021-02-05 23:15:00;2 minutes;A group of 4, then 6 floating, silent amber steady-glowing lights moving around one another before disappearing one at a time. 23:15: To the south, in the PDX northern flight path, I saw 4 solid, pronounced  amber or bright red(ish) orange lights in a square formation. One moved down and disappeared into cloud cover as the remaining three shifted and made an equilateral triangle. They fixed like this for 10- 15 seconds, then formed a isosceles triangle where two got very close to one another and the third was far from them, fixed into being equidistant from them for maybe 10 seconds. Then they all started shifting again, and one left the group and slowly faded away (no cloud cover), and the other two did the same in different directions, one at a time. Over by 23:18.  My partner and I have seen satellites, meteor showers, and the space station before. This was VERY different in color and movement pattern from those or any aircraft I've ever seen. They could turn and reverse without an arc or pause. Amateur sky observers.  My partner went outside after this. At about 23:45 he saw (lone observer), one by one, 6 of the same lights appear one-by-one in the same part of the sky, move around one another in the same way and then one by one leave in different directions and fade away (not into clouds). He said this took 4 minutes.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
