Orb moved from south to north parallel to bridge approximately 100-150 yards away at a relatively slow speed before speeding  away;2020-02-17 19:52:00;6 seconds;Orb moved from south to north parallel to bridge approximately 100-150 yards away at a relatively slow speed before speeding  away I was travelling home from work from portland to washington northbound across the interstate 205 bridge, about halfway across the bridge just after passing governmnet island I saw a glowing pulsating amber yellow sphere parallel to the bridge, there must have been atleast 50 other vehicles on the bridge within sight as well, It was travelling south to north parallel to the bridge. I only got to look at it slowly moving across my view for about 5 seconds before it flew off with astounding acceleration north at a slight upward curve until it dissapeared into the clouds. I've never seen anything move like that before. The portland international airport is within a mile of this location, i could see 3 planes in the distance a few miles away coming in to land at the airport as reference points the orb appeared much much  closer to the bridge I would guess 100 yards, I was driving with my window down and I could not hear any noise coming from the object, just! the wind/ noise from the passing cars on the other side of the freeway. I did not believe in Aliens before seeing the way that sphere moved with my own eyes, I've believed in the possibility of alien life on other planets, There are so many other planets out there some of them have to support life, But I didn't think they would be advanced enough to travel here until i saw the way that orb moved. They are watching us.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
