big blue flash and a blue zigzaging light;2000-07-14 02:00:00;15 sec;big blue flash and a blue zigzaging light On a warm summer night just outside Portland Oregon me and two friends where smoking outside. it was late at night, when we all witness one bright blue flash it reminded me of a lightning flash (a week before we had thunder storms) but cleary blue not whiteish or yellow like in thunder storms. This was a very clear night and when we looked up to see what was happening we all saw a neon blue explosion in the sky that quickly disappeared. Then about a week later as I was walking outside just as I opened the door to my house that faces east looking at mt.hood I saw a long blue zigzaging light across the entire sky from herizon to herizon in a matter of about 10 sec. then I started to research the subject, and witness first hand the ridicule this subject matter gets but I belive more then ever after looking into this that this is real period. Other life exist out there. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

Same spot;2005-12-13 19:50:00;.50-1.0;Saw three flashes, 2 that traveled east to west  1-2 minutes apart, followed by a third that went west to east. Same spot While out in front of the house telling my daugher to drive carefully as she was going shopping, I looked up. The sky was well lit by a full moon high in the sky to my right (SE). I was looking northeast at the moonlight on contrail left by a passing jet on a cold clear night. The contrail was on a normal traffic pattern from south to north.  I saw a flash of light travel past at some what of a flat angle from east to west directly over the contrail. It lasted just about half a second.  I said hey, I just saw a shooting star.  However, It was followed by a longer flash/streak, maybe .6 of a second,  in almost the same spot and same direction only about a minute later. I thought maybe space junk? I haven't heard of any meteor showers, but could be. Then, about a minute later, the same thing happens only this time it goes from west to east. All objects appeared to disappear in roughly the area of the sky. Thats it.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
A bright light that raced across the sky and suddenly shot upward and dissapeared.;2006-01-31 00:40:00;couple seconds;A bright light that raced across the sky and suddenly shot upward and dissapeared. I saw a white light race across the sky and then shoot up and dissapear.  This light was low and it shot up before a hill.  It was very strange, it looked like a shooting star, but changed directions rapidly.  I am not sure what it was and was mostly wondering if anyone else had seen or reported this?  There is an airport on the other side of the hill, but I have not seen a plane move that fast in the sky before?  I am mostly curious.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

At work, I came outside to see flashes of light all over the sky.  Many of them were going back and forth and some standing still.  A few changed color and a few had aura's around them.   This went on for almost an hour then the sky was clear with no trace of them.   This happened in Portland Oregon in the inner North East side of town.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

At first, we thought they were planes.  We were startled. We thought our city was going to become attacked. However, these objects were not planes.  They made no noise.  They were moving slowly but steadily at the same time. They flashed red like a ball of fire. They would come together and then break apart.  Then they would fade as they would rise straight up in the sky. As I continued to walk north down 39th ave, a womn in front of me had also noticed the strange orbs in the sky and was on the phone to her girlfriend to come out and look. I began speaking to the women and we watched the sky.  We were at the corner of 39th and Holgate.  The lights continued coming from the west over the city of Portland and moved north up 39th ave.  Traffic had come to a stop and drivers noticed the lights in the sky. This lasted for 15 minutes.  One orb began to come in closer to us and then it faded and went straight up in the sky and vanished.   I have some of this on video from my phone. There were lights on this orb.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Streaking Bright Flash Witnessed over Portland, Oregon.;2013-12-21 17:30:00;1 second +/- 0.5 Sec;Streaking Bright Flash Witnessed over Portland Oregon I am on the fence as to what was witnessed by my brother and I.   Around 17:30hrs (+/- a few minutes or so), sitting in the living room of my brothers home, my brother and I more or less faced the north-facing window.  All the sudden a bright white flash occurred.  The flash seemed from our perspective, to move from our right, to our left, at a extremely high rate of speed.  The line of sight from where we were looking from, to the general area of the flash in the sky, seems to be somewhere between 25' to 35' degrees up, illuminating through the trees that stood between the flash and where we were sitting at the time.  Trees vary between coniferous and deciduous, with intermittent uninterrupted lines of sight periodically.  We both agreed that the flash originated beyond the aforementioned trees at an unknown distance. We suspected most likely, it was a meteor flash.  But, it did seem slightly odd even for a meteor flash, so I feel this should at least be archived.  We both agree that we saw the exact same event, in exactly the same details upon comparison, to the best of my knowledge.  We monitored the local news for anything related to what we witnessed, which amounted to nothing by the next following morning. More likely, may have been a meteor flash.  But, feel unexplainably compelled to document this event, as this report may prove to be a useful reference for some type of research in the future.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

An orb hovering overhead in the distance, then grew into a very bright round light.   Moving slowly and not in any particular direction.  The light looked like a disc, when it was not full and bright. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

Large flashes of light in N.E, Portland.;2016-05-14 00:00:00;30 minutes;Large flashes of light in N.E, Portland. I was driving from Clackamas to Portland.  I decided to drive over the hill through Happy Valley.  As I was driving up the hill, I saw a huge flash of light that lit up the whole sky around the hill.  As I'm driving down the hill by Willamette National Cemetery, I saw another flash of light.  Then again, as I'm headed west on Foster towards 205.  Driving North on 205 I saw another flash.  I get off the freeway headed towards Columbia BLVD and as Im turning to go west on Columbia I saw like a lightning bolt.  As I'm driving west on columbia BLVD I get out my phone and start recording.  I saw one more flash the weird thing is we've had no thunder and lightening today.  This was very strange to me. ((NUFORC Note:  I was in McMinnville, OR, on the date indicated, and there was a very active lightning storm in progress, at the time indicated by the witness.  The flashes the witness alludes to may very well have been lightning, we believe.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Orbiting object flares, separate flash appears, then object disappears.;2016-08-09 23:00:00;15 seconds;Orbiting object flares, separate flash appears, then object disappears. A co-worker and I were outside having a smoke and looking for Perseid meteors, when I spotted what I thought was a satellite.  The satellite was heading in a north to south direction and traveling at a typical speed for a satellite.  It looked yellow/orange-ish, like most satellites do.   A few seconds into viewing the object, it flared, increasing greatly in brightness and then dimming.  I am aware of what satellite flares are, so I was not surprised at this point.   The object continued to dim and then a bright white/green flash appeared below (?) the object, about the diameter of a quarter if held at arm's distance.  About a second or two later the object dimmed out of view completely.   If it wasn't for the anomalous flash in the vicinity of the object, just before it disappeared, I would assume what I saw was just a flaring satellite.  I'm pretty sure whatever it was was outside of the atmosphere.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Pulsing green light over Portland.;2016-12-09 21:50:00;10 seconds;Pulsing green light over portland I was driving east and in my peripheral saw a bright flash to the north. I looked in that direction thinking it was lightning, and I saw that it was light green in color.  It seemed to fade and pulse brighter.  My next thought was that maybe a vehicle had collided with an electrical transformer (It has been snowing, so there is ice),  but I heard no explosion. For about 10 seconds, it pulsed in brightness, until fading entirely.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Irregular flashing light above Portland, OR.  ((anonymous report));2018-04-01 22:15:00;5-10 minutes;Irregular flashing light above Portland, OR. Went out on my back deck a little after 10:00 pm to let the dogs out.  Saw a slow-moving, flashing light that moved from west to east in the north sky.  Possibly several objects. It flashed irregularly, like it was twisting in the sunlight.  Seemed to be very high altitude.  At one point, it changed to a southeast trajectory.  Called my wife out to see and we both saw a similar light farther west.  Lasted a few minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
