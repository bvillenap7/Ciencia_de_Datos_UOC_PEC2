Four pink/orange lights in V formation flying over metro Portland;1997-09-02 21:45:00;20 seconds;Four pink/orange lights in V formation flying over metro Portland I saw four pink/orange lights flying in a row in my direction (to the north). I thought they were planes, though I thought that it was strange to be flying over a city like that and without blinking running lights. Then they changed direction and flew northwest, but assumed a V formation. I still thought they were planes. Then one of the lights after the leader suddenly left formation did a zippy ring around the leader and darted around it in a most-impossible maneuver for a plane, then resumed its position in the V. Lasted all of 20 seconds, but it floored me. Of course, because I thought they were planes until the very end, I didn't call out for witnesses. Anyone else seen this . . . .?

Two bright lights appeared over the neighbors house and seem to go back and forth, stand still and pulsated at the same time.  They loo;1997-11-14 17:00:00;5 hours;Summary : Two bright lights appeared over the neighbors' house and seem to go back and forth, stand still and pulsated at the same time.  They looked like fireworks in the sky. My name is ((Name deleted)) and I saw a light rising from somewhere behind my neighbors house in the sky.  It did not act like an airplane but before I called my children to come and witness it I stepped out the door and watched it rise rapidly straight up into the air.  I called my four children out to watch with me.  At first we only saw one and then another one appeared over another neighbors house--what really amazed us was how they seemed to be pulsating in a pattern together.  They actually looked like fireworks in the sky when they were doing this.  Everyone I saw who was walking down the street I pointed it out to them--(they thought we were nuts).  I was talking to my Office Manager at work about it off and on while she was at work.  We tried to call the news stations but nobody would listen we didn't have a video camera so we couldn't take pictures.  One of the objects stayed pretty low and started heading off behind some trees, we decided to follow after a minute to see if w! e could still see it.  It was in a holding pattern over a main street, it stayed there for at least 20 minutes then  it took off it made other planes in the sky look as if they were standing still. One of my children wrote about it in her journal right away but I held off until Sunday.  It was a wonderful and exciting sight.  I was really upset that nobody would listen to us in the news media and when the news came on later we heard it was space junk, Who are they trying to kid?;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Wedge formation of 5 round (or disc) shaped objects glowing pale green flying north incredibly fast  on 9/30/01 @ 7:15PM over Portland;2001-09-30 19:15:00;4-5 seconds;Wedge formation of 5 round (or disc) shaped objects glowing pale green flying north incredibly fast  on 9/30/01 @ 7:15PM over Portland ((NUFORC Note:  Witness states dates of January 30 and September 30.  We presume he means September 30.  PD)) Saturday, January 30th ((sic??)), 2001, approximate time - 7:15PM The sun had set with only the slightest pale blue afterglow in the West horizon. The sky was perfectly clear with many stars visible. I was out on my back deck with 2 friends having dinner. I was leaning back in my chair admiring the clear night sky when I saw an extremely bright white falling star streak across the Eastern horizon moving incredibly fast toward the south. It was literally only visible for 1 second, but left a long streak across my retina. I remarked excitedly for my 2 friends to look, but it was already too late. It was only because of the falling star that we saw what happened next. For the next minute we all stood there craning our necks staring at the sky. At this time, there appeared a passenger plane at cruising altitude over to the east, moving slowly towards the NW. Literally less than a minute passed before the friend to my immediate left said What's that? and pointed straight up. I had been looking toward the East where I saw the shooting star, but I looked straight up and saw what she was talking about. The third person with us never saw anything, because the event was over in just a few seconds, and she never locked on. Basically, this is what we saw: Directly overhead there was a formation of very pale greenish dots. They appeared to be very high, but immediately looked very strange and unlike anything I had seen before. The lights didn't appear to be navigation lights, as they weren't points of light, like on a plane, but actual round shapes. Also, the light itself was very strange, because unlike stars, especially falling stars, and/or lights from a plane, they were very pale against the black sky - almost stealthy. It was as if the objects themselves were glowing, and giving off an eerie glow or haze immediately around each shape, as opposed to having lights on the surface. The shapes were arranged in a wedge formation, with a point craft, and 3 more falling back on the right side at a 45 degree angle, and 1 off the point on the left side at a matching opposed angle. 5 objects total. They were close together, and looked like a formation that fighter jets might have flown in, but nothing (in my opinion) man-made could possibly move that fast, and there was no sonic boom or any other noise from them. They flew in a perfectly straight line heading north. They were moving so fast that they literally flew across the whole sky and out of our sight in less than 4 seconds! It was amazing! To give you a reference, the commercial aircraft literally had moved maybe 3 inches across the sky from our perspective in the time it took these objects to span the entire expanse of the open sky and disappear into the horizon, and it was visible to us for several minutes after the formation vanished. Naturally, we started yelling Oh my God - did you see that??? and the like, and found out that unfortunately only 2 of us had seen them. We compared what we saw, and every last detail, including the arrangement and color of the objects was identical. I racked my brain to try to figure out what it could have been, but couldn't think of anything that made sense. If a shooting star hit the atmosphere and broke apart, it is highly unlikely that the peices would have formed a perfectly spaced formation, and would have been bright white in color, like a magnesium fire, not pale green. If it was a missile, again, why the formation and the color? I am sure it wasn't a plane because of the impossible velocity. I was very curious to see if anyone else saw these objects, as it was a warm night and I'm sure there were thousands of people like us out enjoying the weather. Also, the passenger plane was in the vicinity, and flying in a trajectory that would have eventually intersected with the path the formation had flown, so I wondered if they could have seen them too. It was so strange and awesome that I literally was beside myself for a few minutes, but now I am stuck in a rut where I want to tell people that I am pretty sure I saw something unnatural, but am afraid of being ridiculed. I would love to find out what it was if there is an explanation! So there you have it.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

Dual Clusters of unknown objects in the skies of Portland, Oregon.;2008-03-02 19:30:00;5+ minutes;Dual Clusters of unknown objects in the skies of Portland, Oregon. While travelling home from grocery shopping with my girlfriend, I happened to look up into the partly-cloudy sky as something caught my eye.  At first, I thought it was the moon, showing through the clouds, but as you know, when driving, the moon doesn't appear to 'move' noticeably unless you turn your car or the like. It was then that I looked more closely and saw what appeared to be a tight cluster of objects.  It was dark and while they did not appear to be glowing, they were ever so much lighter than the sky or clouds behind them.  My girlfriend was driving so I asked her to stop the car.  We pulled over and got out of the vehicle. She was the first one to see the second cluster. This second grouping was not so 'tight-knit' as the first. I was easy to dismiss the whole event as escaped balloons at first....especially with the first group being so close together. But, with their altitude, it was plain to see these two clusters were much too far apart to be simultaneous balloon releases. We noticed that we could make out individual 'units' in the second cluster which moved almost like fish in the water. There appeared to be 30 or more in this cluster alone. Not pushed about on the wind like floating balloons, and certainly not with the flapping motion of a bird, the movement of each unit was fluid with definite acceleration by some to keep the group together. Birds such as geese, flying in a V formation, do not circle for a better position within their group, as we witnessed that night. I've never believed in aliens, flying saucers or the like, but I was hoping someone has more information on what these objects could more logically be. I think I'd rather live with good confirmation that we are alone in the universe.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

Orange orbs seemingly attached to triangular object witnessed in Portland Oregon 10/18/2011;2011-10-18 00:15:00;5-10 minutes;Orange orbs seemingly attached to triangular object witnessed in Portland Oregon 10/18/2011 The objects were a distance, at least 2 miles, away in the sky. What was noticeable were three large orange orbs of light in a triangle formation, the orbs seemed to be connected to a much larger object that could have been about .25 to .5 miles long.  It seemed that these orang orbs were connected to a much larger object due to the way they maneuvered. It appeared that the large triangular object was hovering and rotating in the same location, and then very slowly moved behind a tall building, which was in the line of sight of the witness, and disappeared.  While this occurred both an airplane and a helicopter flew by, both being much closer than the object, and each orb was significantly larger than either the airplane or helicopter. The observer is a recent college graduate, with a degree in psychology (which trains people in proper observation and recording techniques).  Observer also is not 100% sure this was an extraterrestrial vehicle, however believes it very well could have been one.  Observer also managed to obtain both photographs and video footage of the object.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

Stars moving around, changing position, and appear to be in a formation.;2012-08-11 11:45:00;5-20 minutes;Stars moving around, changing position, and appear to be in a formation. This evening my wife and I decided to go outside and look for &quotshooting stars.&quot  As we lay out on the hammock, I saw four distinct points in the stars that I first assumed to be either part of a constellation or random stars--as it formed an uneven square.  Since we were looking for shooting stars, I paid close attention to the sky.  Within 5 minutes of being outside, I noticed the bottom left point was moving to the right, and the bottom right point was moving away from the square.  Soon thereafter, the former bottom right point continued moving until it disappeared.  At the same time, a new point was moving upwards toward the former square and towards the bottom left point.  I was aghast, surprised, and while my wife reprimanded me on my use of profanity--it is Summer, and my neighbor's windows are open--I noticed the former bottom left, new bottom right point move upwards slightly.  About 10 minutes later the upper left point was moving slightly! to the left, and up, away from the uneven square.  Although I am not a physicist, astronomer, or cosmologist, I am aware that &quotstars&quot do not move left, right, or upwards &quotstars&quot do not assume the position of other &quotstars.&quot  What did I see?  I've never before seen anything like this before, even when out in the middle of the country, where the stars are even brighter.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

Cluster of bright orange lights floating, jumping around in sky;2013-03-17 21:30:00;30 minutes;Cluster of bright orange lights floating, jumping around in sky While driving home last night, around 9:30pm with fairly clear skies I saw about 4 distinct lights floating in the sky. They appeared to be moving together but not connected. They were very bright orange and high up, probably as high as a plane flying at a very low cruising altitude – or a helicopter at a very high flying altitude.  I would describe the movement like hot air balloons, but a few would move up or down ( in relation to the others from my perspective.. could have been side to side ) in what seemed to be a controlled pattern. As I drove I thought it was very strange , trying to focus on the road but very distracted by what these lights were. When I came to an intersection where more of the sky was visible I saw so many more, at least 30. Others have reported seeing 50-100 earlier in the evening! I saw them moving west to east.  Mostly in a cluster , a few trailed off behind. At this point I was very shocked and pulled over, and got out of my car ! to look. I took a photo and video with my cell phone but since my camera is not that great - the photos are blurred and hard to distinguish. The Extremely bright orange lights were like nothing I have seen. They did not flicker or pulse, just a steady bright light. The 30 (estimate) lights moving kept going slowly – to the west. Some would rotate around others... or move to different parts of the group but as a whole they all seemed to be going west. There were many people looking up at the sky wondering what they were. ( it is a downtown area – many restaurants bars etc... ) One particular bar/grill by my apartment appeared to have all the patrons outside pointing and wondering what the lights were. Eventually, they faded into the distance as they all moved west and disappeared into the night sky. After doing some research I discovered these lights were around Portland a few hours earlier as well, as reported by many others (http://www.columbian.com/news/2012/nov/15/experts-uncertain-about-reports-strange-lights-ove/)  This was a true phenomenon .  In my entire life I have not heard of any atmospheric or natural occurrence like this. (Apparently no one else has either.) A local museum suggested it sounds like it was in the atmosphere – but from my perspective it sure seemed like they were floating / moving at the altitude described above.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

We decided to watch it because we have been noticing strange occurrences lately with these lights this month.  Upon observation, we saw two other satellites trailing on both sides behind the brightest light, almost in a triangular formation, then the light to the southwest of the one in front surpassed the brightest light to the north to form a more linear formation.  These lights then disappeared over the northern horizon from our vantage point.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

I was up on the roof of my apartment complex, lying on my back and taking the night sky in.  I saw what I thought to be a shooting star in the sky to the east.  As I looked through my binoculars, I discovered 6 oval-like shapes moving in formation.   They emitted no light nor made any sound, and were dark brown in appearance.  The shape of the objects reminded me of the cap of a mushroom, and they moved slightly from side to side while in formation.   They moved westward through the sky, at an apparent high rate of speed, similar to that of a satellite.  As they headed toward the western horizon, the two objects on the flanks shifted away from the group and quickly fell back in formation.   This event lasted approximately one minute.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

Metallic formation above SE Portland.;2014-10-26 14:00:00;5-10 minutes;Metallic formation above SE Portland While driving on 99 northbound from Sellwood to Portland I witnessed a grouping of fifteen- twenty metallic objects flying in various patterns above SE metro Portland.  At first I thought it was a flock of white birds or geese, but the changes in direction and the size did not seem birdlike.  Also wondered if it was a grouping of balloons that  got away from a car lot or something similar, but then I witnessed several groups break away from the main cluster, accelerate rapidly and fly against the cloud/wind direction, and then rejoin primary group and this occurred several times with different groups forming and then breaking away in different directions at different speeds before rejoining the main group. At various points the group would shift and almost disappear, but during shifts they would also deflect light giving off a  metallic sheen.  I cant't explain what I saw, but I pulled my car over and watched this for about 10 minutes before the objects disappeared into the clouds.

My daughter says she say four.  I did see a plane behind these formations about five minutes in.    I am reporting this due to the methodical way the lights moved.  They were NOT planes.

8 orangey red orbs, floating and flickering in formation in night sky over I-84 on New Year's.;2015-01-01 00:05:00;3-5 minutes;8 orangey red orbs, floating and flickering in formation in night sky over I-84 on New Year's. It was New Year's Eve in NE Portland near NE Sandy, it had just turned midnight and we went outside to let our kiddo bang pans and ring in the new year.  My kid hurt his hand and yelled out, I turned to see if he was okay and was now facing north toward I-84, I looked at his hand and then he ran back into the house, with his father following him.   I did not follow because as I looked up, I saw some reddish orange orbs in the sky, maybe 50 feet up (just above the one story roof lines of our complex).  They appeared to be floating straight towards me, flickering like candles but synchronized.  I called my husband to come back out.   At first, I was afraid they were some huge embers from NYE fireworks or something and was watching to see if they would burn out or land on our building.   Before they reached our building, they took a  turn to the left (about 12 feet or so from me) though the turn was a right angle, the orbs floated smoothly, not particularly fast, just g! liding and flickering, more kept coming, spaced evenly apart and in some kind of formation, at the same height, spacing and rate.  They were almost floating lantern like but not that and way to small for that.  There were around 8 or so in all.  We walked closer and watched them floating by and flickering, not sure what the heck they were, they moved out of our sight and we went back inside.   It kept nagging at me, so I began to look to see if embers like these were even possible from fireworks (I could find nothing.)  I looked for fires or other reports of these orbs in the local news and saw none but then I stumbled upon a bunch of information online about others reporting floating orange orbs in the sky, all over the world.  (I've never heard of such a thing before.)  I came here to check out reports for Portland on new year's and found nothing, so I thought I should report it.

No sound at all, they just moved across the sky in a perfect formation.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
I saw three strange lights moving very fast across the sky in formation but not perfect unison (separate objects);2021-05-25 00:25:00;~10 seconds;I saw three strange lights moving very fast across the sky in formation but not perfect unison (separate objects) My coordinates at the time of the sighting according to google maps: (45.5248002, -122.6920721)  Lying on my apartment’s balcony with my feet pointing north, I saw three dim (almost hazy) white lights moving silently at approximately equal speed from the southwest to the north, passing through the handle of the Big Dipper.  They were almost equidistant from each other in a diagonal line but the one furthest to the right broke formation slightly. It looked like it’s position wobbled in relation to the others. This made me realize that they weren’t quite moving in perfect unison and seemed like three separate objects.  They were moving at high speed. The speed indicated to me that if it were a plane, it would have to be close to the ground in order to appear as if it were crossing the sky so quickly. However, it produced no sound audible to me and did not visually appear close to the ground.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
