Bright white flame traveling to the North low and fast;2019-08-23 20:39:00;10 seconds;Bright white flame traveling to the North low and fast I was outside watering my lawn in the dark.  Being a pilot for over 25 years, I routinely look at the sky for aircraft.  While doing so this time I saw a craft in the East that looked like a rocket with the engine flame out the back but this craft appeared from thin air and traveled at a high speed from South to North and much lower than the airline traffic.  It also appeared to travel a perfectly horizontal path, not changing altitude, and then just suddenly disappeared.  It did not get dim and fade out or get brighter, it just disappeared suddenly just as it had appeared.  The craft was large with a very bright white flame out the back and traveled very low, approximately 10-15 thousand feet above the ground.  There was no sound, at least not that I could hear.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
