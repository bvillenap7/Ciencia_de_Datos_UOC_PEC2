Object seen east of Portland Airport at 1:25pm  Moving steadily south and level;2006-08-29 13:25:00;1 second;Object seen east of Portland Airport at 1:25pm  Moving steadily south and level saw an object for just one second,east of Portland Int'l Airport.  I was driving and saw the object above trees moving steadily south.  It was NOT ascending as all planes from airport would be.  It was somewhat longer than it was high, no lights, it was daytime. It dissapeared from my sight as the trees obscured it. It may have entered the low clouds.         Did not see it as we passed the trees nor was any plane visable at the moment. Turned car around and was back at the same spot shortly looking for perhaps a tethered balloon, but there was none.

Three egg like ships on my street;2009-01-13 21:43:00;about 5 minutes;Three egg like ships on my street I saw three egg like shapes moving down the street about 200 feet from the ground.  I was in my upstairs bedroom at my fathers house when I heard a light buzzing sound outside of the house.  I had my telescope set up and I looked through it.  I saw a bright light and looked out my window with my naked eye and saw the three egg like shapes over with lights moving around.  I called for my dad to come over and when he responded to calls the shapes had taken a left three houses down west.  I am still awed by the power that these extraterrestrials have.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Fireball with black rotating band sighted in SE Portland near Hawthorne 5/5/12;2012-05-07 20:35:00;3 minutes;Fireball with black rotating band sighted in SE Portland near Hawthorne 5/5/12 My husband and I were trying to view the super moon when we stepped out side our house we heard a lady say, what is that. We walked a few more steps out and looked up to see a small oblong orb that looked like it was on fire. There was a long black shadow that kept rotating around the fireball, dimming it as it passed. I ran inside to grab my phone as my husband recorded with his phone. I have a video. When we watched it back, it appeared to suddenly move and then the fire part went out. Then it was just a black orb slowly moving until it was out of sight. We also noticed while watching the video a flashing light to the right of the orb we were watching. We had not noticed that flashing light while viewing the sky. Really freaked us out. The ladies down the street got in there car and drove away before we could talk to them. I really wish I had caught them to see what they thought of it.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
