Looking up at the night sky, talking.   I saw what I thought was a shooting star - because thats how fast it traveled - and it was very high.  I told him to look and he saw it too.   Now this is the great part.  It stopped in the sky almost above us - but way way up like a star- sat a second....shot to the left...sat a second...shot forward....sat a second...shot to the right...sat a few more seconds - and then CONTINUED to streak across the sky like a shooting star.  I mean it went from o mph to probably what would be 15k an hour or something.   No one ever believed us - of course.  But I KNOW that was a UFO - just try and explain it away.  Nothing goes that fast - stops ON A DIME - then maneuvers intentionally 3 times and hoves each time - the goes from 0 to whatever on its way.  Nothing strikes our atmosphere and bounces around in a methodial path with intentional pauses.... ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

As I said in the summary description, this another of the westerly bound green metallic fire balls. I say mettalic becuse the fire ball was green, but the trail glowed with the intensity of a arc welder. I did not notice sparks as other reports entail.

7 orange fireballs  in two groups over downtown Portland, OR;2006-04-29 23:30:00;8 minutes;7 orange fireballs  in two groups over downtown Portland, OR Three of us were walking south towards downtown Portland, OR in NW neighborhood Saturday, April 29th around 11:30 pm. From SW direction appeared 4 fireballs, or circular/spherical shaped lights of orange/ gold. They were all the same size(about 4 times the size of large visible planet) and moving at the same speed (slower than low airplane) in a loosely formed line. They were about 1/2 to 3/4 less bright than an airplane headlight, but soft and diffused, almost fuzzy at edges. They were not flashing but barely pulsating with no pattern, and there was no sound. We really had no sense of how far away they were or how big, it was impossible to distinguish. They were heading NE then took a wide turn towards SE. They appeared to be directly over downtown area. After their turn they slowed to a stop, and stayed without moving for a few minutes, then they slowly began to get smaller/ fade. They still were not moving, unless exactly away from us (I lined them up with a building to check for motion. One dissapeared quicker then the others, and before the others did also, two more lights, exactly the same size, color shape, speed, appeared from the SE in the exact spot as the first group, and continued along the same path and dissapeared where the others had. Other people on the street saw them too, but only one other person stopped to watch them with our group of three. The entire sighting lasted about 8- 10 minutes.

Large glowing red orb;2006-06-10 22:00:00;5 min.;I was driving with my young son in the area of 20th and Burnside.  I saw a crowd in the middle of the street, who appeared to be observing something in the night sky.  I turned the car away from the crowd, and parked my car about a block away and got out. The object was roughly 5 times the size of a star, appeared to make no sound, and was moving to the south. It looked like a large glowing red orb, and was unlike any aircraft I have ever seen.

Saturday, July 31st, just before 11pm, I observed a strange glowing orange ball in the sky when I went outside to check on my cats.  I was mesmerized by the object and noticed it made no sound.   The sky was mostly clear so I got out my camera but could not focus on it and gave up trying to take a picture. It did not seem too far away, traveled in a straight path, did not have any sort of tail, and wasn’t really fire as much as glowing and omitting light from all directions.  Its movement was more floating than flying and was very fluid.  You could not see a definitive shape to the object and it was definitely not a plane.   As it got farther away it appeared to slow down or possibly stopped, but that could have just been the depth of field playing tricks on my eyes.   I called a friend and described it to her in hopes she could see it from her house, but no luck.  The whole experience lasted at least 5 minutes.

Interesting yewllow, red and orange lights seen from S.E.  Portland, Oregon.;2012-07-21 10:30:00;few minutes;Interesting yewllow, red and orange lights seen from S.E.  Portland, Oregon. About 10:30 PM, I was sitting on my SE Portland, Oregon patio deck and observed a couple of bright orange- yellowish lights hovering and moving slowly in the South Eastern sky (clear sky, no clouds)-- towards the direction of Mt Scott, Clackamas county. I looked through my binoculars and saw them. They didn't have any other flashing lights as planes do. Their brightness was about the same as a jet's flood light. They seemed to be in the same general vicinity, one of them I had in sight of my binoculars either faded down or disappeared. They were fairly slow, but about as high in altitude as a plane. I don't know how high they were, but they were about level with my neighbor's chimney, which, from where I sat on my deck would be about a 20-25% rise from atop my deck, which is 10 feet above ground level. I used my Suunto inclinometer for this 20-25 percent inclination estimate*. It would be hard to judge the actual distance the lights were from me. Within 10 minutes of this, or about 10:40 PM I got a call from my father who lives only 800 feet (N/W) from my house. He said he saw about 8 reddish lights in the same south eastern sky, they seemed to be moving upwards, and hovering in place, staying close to each other. Ultimately, I don't know if these are flares or Chinese lanterns, or what they were, but found them Odd. I only saw 2, but my father says he saw up to 8. I just felt it important to report.

Fireballs seen south of Portland, OR area.;2012-12-15 18:00:00;3 seconds;Fireballs seen south of Portland, OR area On the evening of December 15, 2012, my friend and I were driving north on I-5, just south of the Portland area in Oregon (we were south of Tualatin, to be more exact- however, the sighting information states Portland, OR).  It was between 18:00-19:00 in the evening, with a clear sky.  Looking to NNW, we saw two ‘fireball’ structures flash through the night sky momentarily (for approximately 3 seconds).  They were ‘falling’ vertically, as if they were meteorites.  However, I have seen several meteorites (3 over 3 years) while living here, and these were slightly different as I did not immediately identify them as such.  We both saw them, and did not have an immediate explanation. One was slightly larger, primarily white with orange around the edges (no streaking tail) and the other showed up almost simultaneously a short distance down and left of the original structure.  This one was slightly more orange, also with no tail.  They fell through the sky for a short second and disappeared.  They were ill-defined, as if glowing, whereas most meteorites I have seen have clearly defined margins.  I have never seen 2 simultaneously, and all others I have seen have a streaking tail as they fall through the sky. I am not sure if we saw meteorites or not, but I was intrigued when I heard Peter Davenport on Coast to Coast speaking of increased fireball sightings- otherwise I would not have thought twice about it.  I am a graduate student and my friend is a veterinarian working on her PhD- we are both educated people, and educated observers.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Light? Fireball?;2013-03-09 21:12:00;2 minutes;Light? Fireball? I was on the front porch and happened to look up, just to the North of our house, and saw an orange colored light, moving from North to South. It made no noise whatsoever. I ran to the front door and told my girlfriend to come outside quickly, which she did. The light was sill approaching our vantage point and moved almost directly overhead.  The oject seemed to be moving parallel to the ground, on a flat trajectory. There is no wind tonight and the sky is cloudless. There were no aircraft in the vicinity at the time of the sighting. If I had to guess, I would say the object was about 1000 to 1500 feet above the ground. When it got just past us, at one point it kind of slowed for a couple of seconds and moved slightly towards the East, then sped up again and continued to travel South. It seemed to me to be traveling somewhat faster than a single engine civilian airplane would at that altitude. The light seem to fade an brighten very slightly at regular intervals. It faded out then disappeared completely as we watched it. The whole sighting probably lasted for two minutes, from about 21:12 to 21:14 hrs. We could not see any larger object surrounding the light, it was noiseless, moved at a constant speed and altitude, and was moving much to fast to be a Chinese lantern. To sum up the event, it was just very strange!  We live within about 5 miles of the Portland Airport, and constantly see commercial, military and private aircraft at all times of the day and night. I have never witnessed anything quite like this, including other UFO’s that I have seen from the same vantage point.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

Bright white object turned reddish-orange and switched direction at 45 degree angle at high altitude and speed.;2013-12-31 21:40:00;5-10 seconds;Bright white object turned reddish-orange and switched direction at 45 degree angle at high altitude and speed. Facts:   On December 31, 2013, at approximately 21:40 hours, while looking up at a clear sky from the approximate location of 45.527205 N, -122.688007 W, I saw a small object that was brilliantly illuminated in a white color moving due Southwest from near Jupiter in the night sky in the direction of Orion’s belt.  Since the only scale I had for the object was the night sky and planets and stars, I could not determine the object’s size or altitude.  The object continued tracking Southwest for a few seconds, and as it did, it began to glow a bright reddish-orange color.  It could be best described as the color seen in NASA spacecraft re-entry animations. The object then made a precise turn when it appeared near the background of the Easternmost star in Orion’s belt, and at what appeared to be a nearly 45 degree angle toward the East-Northeast at a higher rate of speed and moved away from my line of sight.  I made an effort to re-acquire it visually, but was unable to do so due to a building blocking my view. I was unable to observe a specific object shape, and I do not know if there were several lights on it, or if it was simply one light. Observations:   I have listed the event duration as 5-10 seconds, however, I must admit that the sight of the object was immediately disconcerting since it did not behave in an aerodynamic way. The actual duration could have been simply 5 seconds, given the apparent rate of speed of the object. I estimated that rate of speed to be extraordinarily high, since I also estimated the altitude of the object to be high as well, given that I could not even determine its shape. It is important to note that the object moved in exacting straight lines both Southwest and East-Northeast. The object did not make arced or rounded movements. The object also did not demonstrate the motions of anything organic like a bird or insect. The immediate shift in motion of the object eliminated my first conclusion that I had witnessed a shooting star.  Also, the color on the object became brighter as it moved East-Northeast, rather than fading.  I have done an exhaustive search for any optical illusions that could explain the change of direction and found none. I want to disabuse anyone investigating this of the notion that I viewed this as a metaphysical or spiritual occurrence.  I did not “feel” the object, have “psychic communication” with it, or in any way view it as a sign or contact.  It was merely an observation of an object moving in a way that I cannot explain, and that startled me. I am able to make this report as a result of immediately recording the time, my location, and observations, since I maintain a personal and professional notebook while I am working.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

As we walked north on Milwaukie Avenue, in front of the Aladdin Theatre, a fireball streaked across the sky about 100 feet about the city lights.   We had trouble deciding how high up in the sky the ball was and how big it was, but it snuffed out with in our view. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor?  PD));45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

I am only a couple miles from i5 corridor, and I imagine anyone traveling southward would have had a perfect oncoming view. It flared across the sky, very large and bright. I did not hear a bang, or any sirens minutes later. Reporting for clarity.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

The evening of June 28th I was staying a hotel directly across from the Portland Convention Center.  My room window faced out towards the south east of town with great views from the large room windows in the hotel. Around 2137, lasting for nearly 7-10 mins in total before they slowly floated up into the sky and disappeared. I looked out into the nights sky and over the foothills south of town, I noticed several objects in the sky that were much brighter than the stars and far too close to be a satellite or aircraft.  These objects simply sat there looking like they were floating in a way.  They could be described as looking like large fireball like items in the sky.  There were 6 of them all aligned evenly across the nights sky.  Then, 1 of them slowly started moving away by going up  Into The Nights Sky Slowly,  To All Of A sudden it would just disappear out of nowhere.  This happened until there were only two left. The strange thing was a Blackhawk police helicopter all a sudden took off from downtown and flew right near the objects where it stayed for a min then turned around and came right back downtown.  Shortly after the helicopter arrived back downtown there was all of a sudden out of nowhere a 3rd light that appeared next to the other two lights still hovering there and it literally appeared out of nowhere in the nights sky. I was able to get these objects on film and to this day I still have no clue what those objects were, but I do know one thing after seeing the way they moved and could disappear and reappear out of nowhere they were not of human origin.  These objects look very similar to some other ufo sighting I researched online which seems to be a pattern of this from of sighting.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Bright orange flickering object observed for 90 seconds flying North to South over Portland, Oregon.;2017-07-05 00:35:00;90 seconds;Bright orange flickering object observed for 90 seconds flying North to South over Portland, Oregon. I observed a very strange flying object on July 5th at 1235am (I was so awe struck by the encounter, I immediately noted the time) over Portland, Oregon.  The object appeared to be heading in a general North to South direction and it followed, as far as I can tell, a linear path.  I originally took note of it because it was very bright.  The light was orange in color, looking like a planet might in the early evening sky, though it was even brighter and was about twice the size of what a planet would look like.  The light flickered.   I first spotted it at about 30 degrees above the Northern horizon.  I thought it was odd because it was so bright.  At first I wondered why a plane or helicopter would have such a bright orange light on at that altitude.  I live close to a level 1 trauma center so at first I thought that it might be a life flight helicopter flying to the hospital.  I’ve seen them with their landing/illumination lights on and they can be quite bright.  I couldn't hear a sound and I never did.  I continued to watch it, trying to figure out what it was.  As it got closer, I thought I could see a red navigation light.   However, as the object moved overhead and to the west of me, the red light that I thought was a navigation light appeared to actually be a red shaft of light extending downwards from the bottom of the glowing object. I thought this was really odd.  I’ve never seen anything like it.  It was strange enough to get the hairs on the back of my neck standing up. After the object had passed over my head (maximum height was about 75 degrees), at which point the object was very bright, the object rapidly began to get fainter and fainter until it looked similar to what a satellite would look like flying across the night sky.  Then it faded out and disappeared 35-40 degrees above the Southern horizon.  Total time of the viewing was between 60-90 seconds.   It was by far the most bizarre thing I have ever seen and I can't for the life of me figure out what it was or even surmise what it may have been.  Although I was positive what I had seen was not the ISS, just to check I looked up if the space station was going to make a pass over Portland that night, and I discovered it would be visible over Portland at 4:38am—almost 4 hours after my sighting.  I have seen the ISS a number of times and this was much brighter.   I can't for the life of me figure out what it was.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Orange fireball object approxiamtely the size of a grapefruit.;2017-08-04 23:49:00;1 minute;Orange fireball object approxiamtely the size of a grapefruit. My girlfriend and I were in my backyard on my mattress.  I sleep outside sometimes due to the fact I don't have air conditioner, and the last two days were 100+ degrees.   Before I report what we saw, approximately twenty minutes prior to the sighting we saw a bright white light circular object moving eastward at a constant speed.  The object was moving at a typical helicopter altitude without any sound.  We watched the object for approximately two minutes as it moved perpendicular to us.  Then the light began to fade and dim out completely.   Now, approximately twenty minutes after this moment, my girlfriend and I saw an orange fireball light approaching us from the north, which the object was headed for us.  Initially, it seemed to be miles away, so I grabbed my binoculars while my girlfriend continued to watch the object.  She said she saw a white spot light beneath the object and the object was spinning horizontally and that it transformed into an orb.  I returned wi! th my binoculars to see the object and it was extremely dim, and then I spotted it for one second as it moved behind a douglas fir tree.  It is difficult to explain what I saw, but I'll give my best effort. The object seemed to be a 50 to 100 yards above the ground and perhaps 100 to 200 yards in distance from me.  It was oval shaped but all I could make out was what seemed to be dark orange colored beams , approximately eight of them that were evenly spaced around the object for structure like a house frame.  There wasn't any sound.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

It was levitating slightly with an blurring aura around itself. When I walked towards it, it began very slowly moving upwards, Shrinking with its distance until it was hidden by a layer of clouds;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
