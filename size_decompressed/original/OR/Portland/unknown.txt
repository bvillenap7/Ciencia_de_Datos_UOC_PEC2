Fast moving object with multicolored lights crossing east to west.;1999-12-26 22:30:00;1-1/2 minutes;Fast moving object with multicolored lights crossing east to west. My boyfriend and I (both systems analysts, 30 and 36 respectively)were trying to identify constellations from a field behind his apartment building.  There were no immediate city lights, the sky was incredibly clear.  The moon had not come up yet into view. We first noticed the light in the middle of the big dipper. An unknown sized craft moved from east to west rapidly, it was much higher than planes that were coming in on approach to land at our nearby airport. We thought it was a shooting star, quickly discounted that in favor of a satellite, but then halfway through the movement across the sky, multi-colored lights suddenly started twinkling on it. It took about 15 to 20 seconds to cross the sky, maximum.  It was about 1/3 as fast as a shooting star, stayed in a fairly straight pattern although it did seem to curve off at the end.  We walked out into the field trying to follow it, but it disappeared into a horizon of tree tops.  There was no sound and we did not observe a contrail. It was moving too fast for a jet, we both felt.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Four bright lights with blinking light in the middle seen over Cornilius Pass;2000-02-27 23:00:00;3 minutes;Four bright lights with blinking light in the middle seen over Cornilius Pass I witnessed this strange thing over 4 years ago, but I didn't tell anyone until just recently about what I saw.  I am a 50 year old woman and didn't want my family to think I was crazy.  It wasn't until I mentioned it to someone I know about my experience that they told me that they also had seen a UFO in the same area.  This is what happen to me.  I was driving home over Cornilius Pass in Portland heading to my home in Scappoose, Or.  I had been over at my parents home in Portland.  As I neared Cornilius Pass just before a corner I saw 4 large lights in each corner of this object with a blinking red light in the middle, hanging above the Pine trees.  There was no noice even though I was with in 150 feet of it.  The lights were very bright yet my car was not lit up by the lights.  I would say that the lights were at least 30 feet from light to light.  My first thought was that something was going to crash on the other side of the trees.  As I got closer and went around the corner in the road to the other side of the trees, I looked to see if something had crashed.  I didn't see anything at all.  I suddenly got a feeling of dread.  I knew I had seen something I couldn't explain.  I continued down the road through Cornilius Pass Road.  Which is dark and not too many house are there, I kept looking through the trees to see if I could see it again.  I wanted to stop on the road and look better but I was by myself and the road has no shoulders or driveways to pull into.  About 1 1/2 miles from where I first saw the lights I saw through the trees a V shaped row of lights now hovering above the hill on the other side of where I was driving. I would say there was about three to four lights on each side of the V with one light in the front middle.  There was also a spot light coming down from either the front of the V or just behind the V.  It was spot lighting the ground below.  After seeing that I hit the peddle to the car and got out of there.  It was probably a year ago that I mentioned it to! a friend of my daughters what I saw.  She told me that she has seen a dish shaped UFO following her on the same road.  This has happen to her twice.  I am sorry but I could not tell its shape because the lights were so bright but I can tell you it was big.  I grew up with my dad who was a pilot and have seen many different kinds of planes and helicopters but I have never seen anything like this. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

[This is being written by MUFON investigator, John Kirby, section director, Multnomah County, Oregon] Witness was stopped at a traffic ;2000-05-12 20:50:00;one minute;((NUFORC Note:  Our gratitude to John Kirby, State Section Director for MUFON in the Portland area, for conducting the interview and effectively closing the case.  Our interest was first piqued by the witness, who reported that 1) headlights on nearby vehicles may have failed for a few seconds, and 2) a nearby maroon colored van seemed to have disappeared from her sight during the flash.   These preliminary impressions on the part of the witness apparently did not bear out under investigation.  John Kirby and Skip Schultz, State Director, can be reached over the internet, or through NUFORC.)) [This is being written by MUFON investigator, John Kirby, section director, Multnomah County, Oregon] Witness was stopped at a traffic light at the corner of 72nd and Woodstock in Portland.  While waiting for the light to change, there was a brilliant flash for just a few milliseconds in front of her vehicle and up about 10 feet in the air (very approximate height).  When the flash occurred, power went out in the area -- the traffic light went off, street lights went off, and lights in a tavern at the intersection went off. Her car continued to operate and so did a car across the intersection (that car turned left just after the incident).  The witness was temporarily blinded by the brightness of the flash and said that things looked dark all around (presumably / possibly) by her eyes' reaction to the light. The power came back on in just 1-2 seconds both at the traffic light and at the nearby structures.  Street lamps did not come back on. None of the other drivers (there were at least two other cars nearby) seemed to react unusually (they continued to drive on when the light changed).  Nobody got out of their car to look, etc. Investigator's opinion: This is consistent with an electrical arc (short circuit, fault) on a power line near / above the intersection.  When this occurred, presumably a circuit breaker opened (cut off the power) to the area.  Usually circuit breakers used in power systems are configured to reset after a few seconds, and if the short circuit is cleared, the power will come back on and stay on.  I have been told by members of the power company that small animals or birds sometime straddle power lines causing a temporary short circuit. The animals are unfortunately killed or seriously injured in the process, and are knocked free of the wires by the explosion.  Therefore the short circuit is cleared immediately and the power is restored in a few seconds.  This could also be caused by debris falling on wires and temporarily shorting the line. I did not go out to look at the wires to see if there is an obvious place where short circuits might occur, but I may do that in the coming few days. Note that the reason why the street lights did not come back on immediately is likely due to the fact that lights commonly used by cities, such as mercury vapor lamps, if the power is cut off for even just a moment, will take a few minutes to restart. When this explanation was proposed to the witness, she said that it made sense to her.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

Bright light at high altitude, weaving from side to side;2000-08-11 21:45:00;2-3 minutes;Bright light at high altitude, weaving from side to side I saw an unusual light pass over the Portland area tonight. It was just after dark, around 9:45 p.m. It moved from West to East. It was a bright bluish white light. At the same time I saw a commercial jet pass underneath the object, which was traveling from South to North, at about 30,000 feet. I would guess the other object above the jet was 10 to 15,000 feet higher than the jet. And the object appeared to be traveling at a higher rate of speed than the jet. When I first noticed the object I thought it was a satelite. But, even though it was on a straight path it was moving slightly from side to side, kind of like a drunk driver!! I could see no other lights like running lights on regular aircraft. And the side to side movement would be impossible to perform in a standard aircraft.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Observed object in Clackamas- Oregon City area.;2001-07-15 20:25:00;5-10 minutes;Observed object in Clackamas- Oregon City area. I was listening to the Jeff Rense program last night.  I was kind of relieved when I heard 3 callers mention the strange object in the sky on Sunday the 15th. I called my wife to the radio so she could hear that I was not making things up about that night. I was sitting in my car on 80th street south of Powell Blvd when I noticed something further south approximately 5-10 miles.  Whatever it was it stayed stationery for some time turned on it side, leveled back down then proceeded to go southward towards the Clackamas Town Center-Oregon City area. I was waiting for my wife at the time while she was in her mothers Adult Care facility.  I had mentioned to her about it at this time but when she came back to the car at 8:30pm it was no longer in sight.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Two stationary lights, side by side, above the clouds and Willamette River.;2002-08-02 21:45:00;5-10 minutes;Two stationary lights, side by side, above the clouds and Willamette River. Upon glancing out of an east-facing window, I saw what I first thought was the moon, above the clouds...Then realized that it couldn't be, because there were two sources of light-and went out of the room to retrieve my glasses. Upon returning to the window about 30 seconds later, saw no lights. I was puzzled, and continued to stare up @ the partly clouded sky. All at once, two lights simply appeared-as though switched on-above the clouds in roughly the same place they were too large to be anything I could think of, and side by side, bright but diffused around the edges by the clouds. I stared up at them for at least five minutes, maybe longer, and they were stationary and unchanging. Suddenly, the one on the left both changed shape and blinked out, within a couple of seconds. Soon the one on the right went out-without changing shape first. The lights were within the atmosphere-much too low to be a satellite, but I've no idea how many degrees from the horizon they were. I've never seen anything like it, ever! ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at length, and we found her story to be quite convincing.  She was certain that the objects were above the cloud layer, and that they were not advertising lights.  PD));45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Sighting of a possible beam or tether directly connected from the ground to an aircraft at an altitude of 2,500 ft.;2002-09-17 23:30:00;10 minutes;Sighting of a possible beam or tether directly connected from the ground to an aircraft at an altitude of 2,500 ft. Looking to the South from my 2nd story kitchen window, what I first observed was what appeared to be a blue/purple beam, which was wavy in shape, but completely linear in direction. This beam had the appearance of a thin streak of lightning, yet was relatively dim. It appeared to be fluorescent in nature, as opposed to lighted from any external light source. The beam was very clearly connected to the ground, approximately 1/4-mile south from my location. Upon first sighting the beam, it was angled away from me at approximately 60 degrees from the horizon, facing Southeast. Following the beam upwards, it grew dimmer with distance, becoming invisible to the eye at approximately 200-300 meters. Upon following the beams upward trajectory, I spotted an aircraft flying at approximately 2,500 ft. in a North to South trajectory, with seemingly normal exterior lights: 2 white strobe lights, with 1 steady dim red light between the 2 white strobes. The strobes were blinking together, at an interval of 2 quick strobes in rapid succession separated by 3/4 (.75) second between bursts. The strange beam appeared to be literally connected to this aircraft, although at that distance I could not confirm this due to the beam becoming too dim at that altitude. The reason I say that the beam appeared connected to the craft is this as the aircraft passed overhead from South to North, the angle of the beam changed precisely with this movement as though it were tracking the aircraft or being emitted from the aircraft to a fixed ground location. I lost sight of the aircraft several times, but needed only to follow the path of this beam upwards to relocate the aircraft's position. The angle of the beam changed from and angle of 60 degrees facing South East, to 90 degrees straight up, to an angle of 45 degrees facing North, precisely in unison with the aircraft as though it were a tether of some sort, attached to the aircraft and fixed to the ground. The aircraft proceeded to fly in its linear trajectory to the north, until at s! uch a di stance as to be no longer visible. The beam remained pointing to the north in the direction of the aircraft's last visible position, for several minutes preceding the aircraft's departure. I observed the beam as well as the aircraft through my binoculars. At this higher magnification, the beam appeared unsolid and quite wide. The structure of the beam was wavy, similar to the structure of lightening, although its path was ultimately perfectly linear. The beam maintained a constant luminosity, and did not appear to be changing shape, despite its wavy, electricity-like appearance. The width of the beam was comparable to a toothpick held at arm's length, and was blue/purple in hue. The closest comparison I can think of to describe this beam would be a semi-transparent fluorescent tube. It was also comparable to a thin, focused beam shining through haze, although it was a clear night. I have ruled out the possibility of some sort of physical tether, i.e. kite string, for the following reasons: 1) The apparent size was far too thick - a tether seen from even as close as 1/4 mile away would be nearly invisibly thin, were it any less than 6 inches in thickness. 2) The linearity of the line was absolutely perfect - it was not sagging earthward as would be expected with any sort of tether, even under extreme tension. Yet it truly appeared to be anchored to the aircraft above, as well as the ground below. After observing the beam and aircraft for 1 minute and it became apparent that their motions were somehow unified, I awoke my wife from bed so that she could verify what I was seeing. She was easily able to see the beam, which she said appeared to her like a high-flying jet plane's vapor trail, but aiming directly into the ground at a very close distance. After the aircraft had left, and the beam had ceased movement but was still visible, I decided to leave my home to try and locate the point where it contacted the ground. As soon as I was on ground level, my vertical line of sight was too narrow and the su! rroundin g lights were too bright so that I could no longer see the beam. I quickly returned to my second floor window to verify it was still visible. It was, so I again left my home and drove in my car to approximately directly below and a bit closer to where I suspected the beam to be. The drive was approximately 1 minute. I searched the sky for an additional minute, and then returned home. I was away from home for no longer than 4 minutes. Upon returning home, the beam was no longer visible. In hindsight, I should have remained at home and kept the beam in sight. But my curiosity was too great, and the beam disappeared sometime during my 4-minute search away from home. The total duration of this sighting was approximately 8 minutes, from the moment I first observed the beam, to the moment I left my home to search for its source. At no point was any sound audible. I am an amateur astronomer and aviation enthusiast, so I am constantly observing the sky and local aircraft with a telescope and binoculars, but have never witnessed anything abnormal until now. My father is an international pilot, and we have discussed the many highly strange natural phenomena that he observes regularly during his flight paths over the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Arctic. My understanding is that this phenomenon is completely unique, so I am extremely curious to learn if any other similar observances have occurred elsewhere.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  The clouded parts of the sky on that day had some weird shaped circular or oval.;2004-02-21 22:05:00;unknown;The clouded parts of the sky on that day had some weird shaped circular or oval. Hi Brian,  I was out on an errand yesterday afternoon. The sky in Portland was clear and dry except for the jet trails overhead which had obscured parts of the clear blue with some agglomerating cloud cover.  I hardly go anywhere without a digital camera these days. I snapped lots of sky pictures as aircraft trails intrigue me, especially on a rare otherwise clear day.  Several pictures were quite interesting. The one attached here had a plane approaching passing to my right which I remember seeing, and a green spot, possibly a lens flare, which I don't remember seeing. So I decided to look a bit closer at it to discover what may have caused the green spot. Also, this picture is under exposed to highlight the sky details, a trick I learned a while back.  The clouded parts of the sky on that day had some weird shaped circular or oval tracers cut into them, some quite clear which I have other pictures of from 2-20-2004. This intrigued me further to see what I could learn about the green spot. After all, it's not every day you are dealt a green spot in a photo (or maybe it is, you decide).  I made a copy of it (-2) and cropped out an area, because in the original image I thought I saw what could be a circular or oval tracer near the green spot.  I then solarized a copy (-3) and you can plainly see the green spot (now turned magenta) appears to be leaving some kind of trail behind itself, coming off of a circular tracer. If you look closer, it appears there may be even more objects and circular tracers. Maybe, maybe not. They may just be artifacts of the enhancement program.  There appear to be in close proximity two other similar, or the same, objects flanking the circular tracer. Of course, that is my guess, and they may just be spots in the clouds. Or maybe not. The green spot is making me think adolescent showing off to its buddies for some reason. I mean, what with impending springtime and all.  The spot in the upper left is the sun illuminated cloud cover.  Just thought I would brighten your day a wee bit. I am a novice at this and don't know how to get more out of this photo. Maybe you can, or know someone who can.

It was a cloudy night and I was walking the dog when I noticed really weird lights in the sky.  The were  faint (not spot lights) you could tell the lights were on the other side of the clouds.  The lights had a center and the lights would join all together then four different lights would all go out different amounts each time.  They would revolve around the center light about 3/4.  Then they would go back in to the center.  Sometimes they would only go out 10 feet other times they would go out  100+ feet.  Then all of a  sudden the light got really bright and took off and that was it.  I'm not some fruitcake or wierdo, It was like nothing else ever seen before.  The others agreed.  We called the TV news and 911 even but  not 2 minutes later the lights were gone.  I never heard anything.  I've lived here a while and never seen anything like it.  My dog was going crazy all night too. ((NUFORC Note:  We observe that the description provided by the witness is not inconsistent with revolving advertising lights.  Just a guess on our part.

Small craft, rapid movement and flight path, no sound.;2004-08-02 02:13:00;3 minutes;Small craft, rapid movement and flight path, no sound.

Object moved in a rapid zig zag motion and flashing white and red lights very rapidly and also duplicated colored lights before changing colors again.  Red and White lights would alternately flash and then flash white a few times and then red a few times, it would then start alternating back to red and white again.  It made a turn in an arc (half moon) to direct south.  I lost contact for about one minute when it went behind a building but I viewed it again over the Willamette River when object soon disappeared.  Object was approximately 1000-1500 feet in air and smaller than a dime in size.  Displayed 2 colors and viewed for apporoximately 3 minutes.

Loud object with three lights.;2004-12-22 20:30:00;10 Minutes;Loud object with three lights. We first noticed a loud noise, similar to a helicopter but much louder. It was definitely an engine noise. We went outside to see what it was, and saw a formation of lights hovering some distance away. The lights were not in any pattern that we had seen on an aircraft before. There were three visible lights: reddish-orange, blue, and strobing bright white. The white light appeared to be towed by the other lights. It was hard to make out any shape of the body of the thing. It hovered for a few minutes and then moved very rapidly southeast. The noise continued to get louder as it came overhead, then got quieter as it moved away. The object stopped suddenly and hovered again for a short amount of time. It then shot off southeast again. Each time it moved it moved extremely smoothly and quickly. When it hovered, it seemed to stay perfectly still. The weather was cloudy with very little wind. ((ADDENDUM FROM MR. TOM BOWDEN, STATE DIRECTOR OF MUFON/OREGON)) Probably helicopter or ultralight aircraft This is a follow-up of a report previously submitted. Based on the information given in the report, it is probable that the witnesses saw and heard some sort of helicopter, ultra-light aircraft, or experimental aircraft.  The presence of a loud engine noise similar to a helicopter motor strongly suggests this explanation. I would be glad to investigate further if the witnesses have more information to add to the initial report, or if they feel strongly that this explanation does not fit the profile of the incident.

Craft with tan X on the bottom. Seen on 5 different occasions in 5 months.;2007-11-03 19:12:00;4 minutes;Craft with tan X on the bottom. Seen on 5 different occasions in 5 months. I have seen a particular “craft” five times in the last five months. I saw it again tonight at about 7:12 p.m. PDT. I would estimate its altitude at about 3,000 to 5,000 feet. The speed seemed to be about that of a commercial passenger jet. The lights on this craft are non-typical. There is a blinking blue-white light at the front. Then there a bar with several lights that are slightly orange (maybe about the color of tungsten lights), just past the center of the craft, that go laterally, and look like cubes placed side by side. They shine towards the front and back of the craft. There are no lights on this craft that are typical of normal aircraft navigational lights. It appears that the craft is black with a tan colored “X” painted on the bottom side. The ends of the X shape are at the front and back of the craft. This craft makes no sound that I can detect.  All five times I have seen the craft it has been moving from North to South, and at different altitudes. My sighting of it have all been at night, shortly after the sun has set and it is complete dark outside.  The first time I saw this craft was in late May or early June, and I have seen it four times, about once a month, since then. The first time I saw it, I happened to look up, and it had passed right over the top of where I was standing. It was moving fairly slowly, and made no sound that I could hear. I have not been able to see the actual outline shape of the craft against the night sky, but it appears to be either flat on the bottom, or possibly slightly concave. It is many times wider than a normal airplane or jet.  In hindsight I should have recorded the times and dates of the previous sightings of this craft, or made reports on them.  Another report of a craft that might be similar can be seen here:  http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/058/S58560.html;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Drifting silent object estimated size of helicopter at 1000ft with bright flamelike intermittent flashes in night sky;2007-12-08 22:15:00;15 minutes;Drifting silent object estimated size of helicopter at 1000 ft with bright flamelike intermittent flashes in night sky Good Evening-  My wife and I were driving home tonight about 10:15.  We were heading south on SE 174th just north of Powell when we saw flashes in the sky.  We pulled over to see if we could see what it was and, from our vantage point looking just west of south,  it appeared that there was a helicopter hovering over Powell at about 170th and that it was firing off a strobe of some sort.   The color of the flashes looked more like fire (yellow) than like illumination and I had the impression at first that they were circular as you would see looking at a  'flashbulb'.    We watched for three or four minutes trying to hear any sound of helicopter blades.   There was not any sound. The shape of the object still appeared to be helicopter sized but there not clear running lights and the flashing didn't recur right away.   At this point,  the object appeared to be drifting in a north-northwest direction and passed overhead and just to the west of us.   Still no sound.   Occasionally there was a flash of bright light again or two but not strobelike.   I called my brother who lives almost due west of us at about 90th and asked him to go out and look as the object was getting farther away still appearing to be slowly drifting on an air current---straight line. My brother called back and was looking with his binoculars but couldn't find anything.  The object was, at that point too far to identify in the lighthaze west of me.   I looked at my clock at that point and it was 10:27 so we'd been watching for probably fifteen minutes.   A small plane on a somewhat parallel course in the opposite direction had come out of the northwest heading to the southeast about five minutes earlier and its engines were clearly identifiable. The only scenario I could envision for this event was that a hot air balloon was drifting and was having fire problems with its propane system, but the shape of the object and the inconsistency of the flashes didn't fit and the fact that it was a December night also made it unlikely.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Many white lights/objects moving at high speeds throughout the day.;2011-06-21 08:00:00;~8 hours+;Many white lights/objects moving at high speeds throughout the day. I began taking photographs of the sky at approximately 07:00. I began noticing movement in the sky, but initially wrote it off as my imagination.  With the naked eye they were nearly impossible to see small pinpricks of light moving at very high speeds. However, they were captured in the photographs.  Zooming in on the photos they appear to be small shining orbs or motes of light.  They almost resemble stars against the morning and afternoon sky, though I never noticed one sitting still. They seemed to be most noticable surrounding aircraft. I would wander outside at irregular intervals to snap a few more photos.  I stopped at approximately 16:30, at which time the lights or objects were still active.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

I was driving down W Burnside Rd, in the west hills, facing NE, going around what I believe is Washington park.  As I was going around a curve, there was a very tall tree in front of me, on the hill that the curve goes around, I saw a very large object going behind the tree.  It was directly in front of me.  I believe the reason it cough my eye was because it was so so so shiny it looked to me as if a piece of tin foul with the most bright light shining off of it.  The shine was most bright in the middle of the object and faded as it got closer to the sides of the object where you could see medal it looked like tin foil.  This object was about 6 or 7 times the size of when you look at the sun.  It was only maybe 500 or so feet directly in front of me. It took up about 2 or 3 of the limbs on the tree.  There was not a cloud in the sky.  I do not remember the shape but I know it was a solid shape like a circ! le or octagon or some kind of shape like that.  There was nothing hanging off the object like wings of propellers.  This whole time I was on the phone with a friend (she is planning on making a report of what happened on her side of the line.)  But I thought I had only seen it for a glimpse of a second.  But my friend told me I stopped talking for over a minute.   When I came to the other side of the curve there was a few trees, but the object was no longer there.  I think the weirdest part is that there was NO noise at all.  I do remember as soon as I saw the object I was so infatuated with it.  It happened so fast but just remember being amazed not even thinking about if it was a plane or not but just wanting to see it.  I don’t remember any of the time from seeing the object, until my friend had been yelling in my ear, Hello?;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
I was looking up at the moon facing South from my Southeast Portland front porch, when I saw some red and green lit object almost float;2011-10-08 21:10:00;15- 20 seconds;I was looking up at the moon facing South from my Southeast Portland front porch, when I saw some red and green lit object almost floating south in the sky.  It would descend and then hover repeatedly for the time that it was visible.    I wasn't able to make out a shape, but I could definitely tell that it was not something that I had seen before (I've seen Chinese lanterns, weather balloons and meteors).   This was about the size of a small airplane by the formation of the lights on the object.  It disappeared behind the tree line. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and she seemed to us to be exceptionally eloquent and objective in her description of her sighting.  We suspect that she is a quite capable, and reliable, witness.  PD));45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Was up late Wednesday night, early Thursday morning, and went out to the alley behind my apartment in Northwest Portland (Around NW 23r;2011-10-27 03:00:00;Approx 5 minutes;Was up late Wednesday night, early Thursday morning, and went out to the alley behind my apartment in Northwest Portland (Around NW 23rd Ave) for a cigarette before bed when I noticed two lights in the sky. One orange-ish red, the other blue-ish green. There was no other light so I couldn't make out a shape but these lights were not separate entities they were definitely both apart of the same object. At first I shrugged it off as an aircraft, turned the other way and finished my cigarette. 2 or 3 minutes later when I turned to go back inside I looked back to the North and the aircraft was still in the same location. I stood and observed it for another 2 or 3 minutes and watched as it seemed to hover in place. My next instinct told me because of the size of the lights, much larger and brighter than any of the closest stars, that it was at a lower altitude, and because of this and the fact it was hovering I assumed it might be a helicopter. However there was no audible engine noise which would be impossible for an Aircraft this size at this altitude. Unless of course I have serious hearing impairment which I do not. Another remarkable thing about this object was that the lights were near perfect spheres, no blurring, blinking, or flashing. Just nearly perfect luminescent spheres. Also the Orangeish and Greenish lights were the only lights I observed. No blinking lights on the belly or tail like you'd come to expect from a commercial or passenger Aircraft. Lastly the position of the object would've placed it between Forest Park and downtown Portland, in my opinion a precarious, and somewhat suspicious position for any conventional aircraft to be flying, especially considering it's somewhat low estimated attitude. To end, I'd like to add that I worked nearly 2 years as ground crew at Portland International Airport. During my time there I've worked on all types of aircraft from small commuter planes to Airbus 330's. I'd like to think of myself as fairly knowledgeable when it comes to identifying the various Aircraft the fly in and out of PDX. However I could not identify this as a conventional aircraft.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

Curious to know what is going on.;2012-08-08 05:00:00;one or more hours;Curious to know what is going on. I live in Portland, OR and since the begining of summer I have noticed strange things in the skies at night. Almost nightly there are bright glowing orbs that are orange/ white in color.  They are stationary until just before dawn.  I have personally witnessed one raise from below to the tree line rapidly moving vertical until it was positioned close to the moon, and there it stays. Naturally I know its not by the moon but it's relation to the moon's position in the sky is strange. It isn't a star or jupiter as my friend tried to explain.  I dont know what it is and the pictures I have taken arent very good quality but they are pictures of what I am describing and feel free to check it out. I would like to know what it is.  I took these throughout the month of August and September 2012.  All the photos are taken from the West Facing East early Am before the sun comes up.

Bright red orb over N. Portland.;2014-02-02 19:00:00;15 minutes;Bright red orb over N. Portland I was called outside by my husband and a friend after the superbowl game, they were questioning what was up in the sky and asked me if it was the planet Mars.   Up above us was a bright red orb in the sky, shining underneath a cloud cover and appeared to be moving towards the west hills in N. Portland.  It started out bright red, and made no sound.  It began to dim until it disappeared completely.  I didn't believe that it was a planet or a star because it was underneath a cloud cover, it did not appear to be a plan because it was moving slower than a plane and at times remained still.   Moments later it reappeared bright red again then dimmed and disappeared this was over a period of 15 minutes and after appearing a second time it did not reappear.   I had posted a message on facebook asking if anyone else had saw the bright red light, about an hour later at 20:08 hours a friend who lives 20 miles SW from me responded to my post stating that they could see it and as! ked me what it was.  During its second appearance I had taken pictures and a short video of the red orb which my husband had sent prior to this entry.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Very fast moving object with red and blue lights.;2014-03-23 20:00:00;30 seconds;Very fast moving object with red and blue lights My 3-year-old daughter and I were getting home from a barbeque and it had just gotten dark.  As I pulled her out of the car I noticed an object moving very fast from south to north above the tree line on our hill.  It had red and blue lights flashing, like an airplane or helicopter, and it was the size of a small airplane, but did not have wings.   From what I could tell, it was oval-shaped, but it was moving very fast and the lights were blinking brightly so it was hard to make out an exact shape.  It traveled from the south side of the hill to about the middle of the hill.  Normally planes fly over our house at an extremely high altitude, but this was very low and moving so fast, I thought it was going to crash.  But then it disappeared behind the trees.   I thought it could have been a helicopter, but it didn’t look like a helicopter and it was going way too fast to be one.  About 2 seconds later, it darted out and went north to south.  Then, after it hover! ed for about 2 seconds it took off, going south to north again.  It was zig zagging like this for about 30 seconds, and it was very unsettling, it seemed like it was scanning the area.   I didn’t want to be outside anymore because it was very frightening, so I ran to my front door carrying my daughter and we got inside fast.  I didn’t look out the window to see if it was still out there, so it could have gone on longer, but I only witnessed about 30 seconds of this zig-zagging movement.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Vibrant colorful lights throbbing across the sky in the middle of the night.;2014-05-18 03:20:00;00:05;Vibrant colorful lights throbbing across the sky in the middle of the night. My boyfriend and I were standing in our kitchen at 3:20 AM last night (early this morning). His back was to the window as I was facing him and the window.  The window looks to the northwest towards the Rose Quarter/Moda Center.  As I was talking to him, a flash from outside caught my eye.  It was bright red and took up a very large portion of the lower sky.  It was throbbing like a strobe light and changing colors with each throb.  I shouted, Look at the sky!! We both ran over to the window and for the next maybe four seconds, watched as the colors changed.  Then it was just gone.  My first thought was it was some kind of event going on as it's not abnormal to see spotlights in the sky for things like that.  Then I remembered that it was 3:20 AM and the entire city was pretty much shut down. I've been monitoring news sights, asking facebook, etc and have found no answers whatsoever. Northern Lights is the closest looking thing I can describe it as lookin! g like but that's not what it was.   Did anybody else see this or have you seen anything similar?   I can't stop thinking about it and would love to hear any opinions on what you think it was??;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
3 Events of unidentified aircraft activity.;2014-08-26 03:30:00;3 events;3 Events of unidentified aircraft activity Looking into the eastern section of the sky near the star of Menkar and to the west of the region of Orion, me and my friend saw a bright blue flash which occurred twice with a brief 6 second pause.  It did not happen again.   Then we see an airplane travel from the south in that direction but did not produce sound like a regular commercial airliner or produce little to no sound.  We were both freaked out when we saw a light appear out of no where.   A UFO appears out of no where trailing the airplane very close and very quickly (again near that area in the sky maybe not Menkar but a star cluster near that star).  No blipping lights, no red, no sound. What was unusual was that as it traveled North we see the back end of the airplanes wings which had extremely bright spotlights which I have never seen before on an airplane.   Then we see another flying craft with no blipping lights, no sound travel from constellation of Orion or a bit east of it.  It again travels towards the North. Possibly fog lights on the back of the wings?  I strongly believe that what we saw was a UFO sighting and activity linked to the bright blue flash.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

Blue streak morphs into flashing lights.;2014-10-30 04:00:00;10 seconds;Blue streak morphs into flashing lights I am writing this report for my brother because he wouldn't bother reporting it. At approximately 4 am pacific time my brother was driving home from work on I-205 south near the I-84 east exit.  He ran into some traffic and came to a complete stop.  While he was stopped, he decided to pull out his cell phone and take a snapchat video of the horrible traffic to send to his friends.  He took the video, and when he went to review it, noticed that he had caught a strange light in his caption.  I should mention that he is taking this video from inside his car.  His view is looking over the interstate, and an overpass is approximately 1/4 of a mile ahead.  In the video, just a few seconds after the it starts, a bright almost neon blue light streaks down from the upper left of the video screen.  As the light falls from the sky it disappears for a second, then reappears only to come to a complete stop.  It appears that the light is just beyond the overpass 1/4 of a mile ahead.  At the same time this blue streak stops, it lights up and flashing lights rotate in a circular! direction around the craft.  The craft then drops very 'mechanically' or abruptly and continues to flash sporadically until the video ends. I should mention that i have a copy of this video on my computer.  I will send it to you if you want.  Since its a cell phone video, the quality isn't the best, but you can plainly see what I'm describing when you watch it.  I should also mention that in the video, my brother is listening to eminem (the rapper).  My brother says ((profanity deleted)) part way through the video and it seems he is reacting to the UFO, but he is actually reacting to the bad traffic.  It is not till reviewing the video that he notices the light.  Thanks!   I appreciate everything you do and I hear you on coast to coast all the time!  I have a few more amazing sightings that were from a reliable friend of mine that I could share as well. -((name deleted)) from Canby, Oregon ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I saw 5 UFOs over Portland, Oregon on November 23, 2014.;2014-11-23 18:20:00;10 minutes;I saw 5 UFOs over Portland, Oregon, on November 23, 2014. On November 23, 2014, at 6:20 pm I believe I saw an unidentified flying object.   My room is seperate from the house.  To get into the house I have to walk up the back deck leading to the back door of the house.  So, on my way into the house from my room I looked up into a pretty dark sky.  Cloudy.   There directly northward were 3 lights.  Pretty big lights.  The shape was indescribable from the distance. I examined them as closely as I could.  They had my attention because the more I looked the more I realized that these are not the airplane or helicopter lights that are commonly seen at night in my SE Portland area near the Sellwood Bridge.  (Which by the way is currently under construction.)   On any night one would have no problem spotting airplanes coming from the south.  More common than ones coming from the north.  I've seen as many as 4 helicopters hovering over the city at one time late at night from 11pm and on.   Anyways, there I stood on the deck right outside th! e back door looking at these 3 lights that I noticed moved around very strangely in ways you could not expect from conventional aircraft.  Side to side.  Down, up and in circles.  While it was hard to see the shape I could see they were orange and red in color.  And sometimes just white.   As 2 of the lights slowly began to fade away, 2 more extra bright lights slowly began to appear from the horizon.  They moved higher and higher.  The first 3 had some manner of formation but were definitely independent of each other.  The 2 new bright lights came in formation but then split up as they got closer to the rest.   For a short time all 5 were together before 2 of what I believe were the first set of 3 faded away out of sight.  The 3 remaining did a slow dance.  Unpredictable in nature.  And offbeat.  At least 2 or 3 more times I saw 1 or 2 fade away and another 1 or 2 appear to rise from the horizon.   There were too many objects in my vision down lower for me to see where they may be coming from but if I were to guess I would say at least 5 or 6 miles aw! ay.  Probably more, not sure. I shot some shaky video. They only appear to be dots of light on camera.  But, I asked my mother to come look and she watched them for at least a couple minutes.   The entire spectacle lasted about 10 minutes but who knows how long they had been there before I noticed them.  The airport is about 15 miles northeast of where I live. East of where I saw these UFOs.  I live about 15 blocks from the river.  After doing a quick search my mother discovered that there was a UFO sighting earlier the same day in Paris, France.  Sort of similar to what I saw.  I feel like there is more details I should be giving but I'm forgetting.  I called my brother who lives within 2 miles away to look up and see it.  His girlfriend answered the phone and as I was giving my reason for calling they started to fade away.  When I got off the phone they made at least one more brief appearance before disappearing for the last time.  I guess that's all for now.  I'm working on getting a hold of l! ocal news.

The white light I saw was on the right side and I could make out what looked to be three barely visible white lights on the left side.   I could not make out the shape of the craft, but it appeared to be dark in color.  Its heading was North to South, then when it was South of my position, it turned to the Southwest.

Anyways, so a large cloud rolls in from the South, and as soon as the cloud broke away, it's gone, just like that, didn't see it leave, but something was there, for almost a good half hour, something was there, just hovering, shining in and out.. definetly not a star either, too bright outside.. but what got me was how brilliant the light reflecting off it was when the sun did hit it..  2nd time in  the past 31 of my 54 years that I saw something sky-high in broad daylight that didn't fit.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
