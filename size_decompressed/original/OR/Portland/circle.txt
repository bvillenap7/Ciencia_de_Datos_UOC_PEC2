The object was very bright like a shooting star. I was driving north and saw a flash to my right (east) the flash was a bright white round fire ball type object that had a tail.  The object was about 45 degrees above my horizontal plane, and appeared to be just above the tree tops (I was driving in a pretty deep vally). The object moved from east to west, was visible for approx. 3 sec.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
initially seen while I was indisposed of.;2000-04-30 22:30:00;10-13 minutes;initially seen while I was indisposed of. I was pre-occupied in my bathroom when I seen out of the corner of my eye through an opened bathroom window an dull oranged colored circular ball of light slowly moving.  It took me about 5 seconds to realize what I was seeing.  When I was finished, I grabbed my camera and went outside for a better look.  Since I live in an apartment building on the second floor this took me about 3 minutes to get outside and down to the corner of the building.  When I got to the corner of the building I seen the object still traveling slowly in its original flight path in a south/easternly direction.  Only this time it had changed color to a dull white and in both colors, it was slightly fuzy.  It moved at the same speed to a part of the sky and then stopped.  It stayed there for a moment or two and then moved north to another portion of the sky.  It was just above the cloud line.  While it was moving I was making attempts at taking pictures of this craft.  It got to another portion of the sky and then stopped again.  It stayed there for a moment or two as if waiting for the clouds to conceal it.  It then disappeared in a flash.  I personally think I seen the craft shoot off to the east. it.  I seen a special on Fox T.V. last week and it resembled one of the plasma ships I seen on the show.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

Crescent of lights, may have been edge of large craft.;2002-04-27 23:40:00;4 minutes;Crescent of lights, may have been edge of large craft. At about 11:40 PDT tonight I was in the bathroom, just had a little night light on, and I happened to look over the top of the curtains at the night sky. To my surprise I saw some odd looking lights moving from more or less Northwest to Southeast. I opened the window to get a better look and was astounded! It's confusing to me because I'm still not exactly sure if I was looking at a single craft of multiple craft. What I saw was several blue white lights evenly spaced in a crescent shape, and an odd fuzzy looking larger light or multiple lights. That was odd as well. I was facing West at the time and the larger light may have been some kind of light in the center of a circular craft. It was a different color than the other lights, and was a little farther to the West, and may have been at the center of a craft. At first I thought I was looking at about 20 craft, but now I think it may have been one very large craft. I grabbed my binocs and ran out to the front yard to try to get a better look, but was having trouble getting the binoculars focused, and there is a kind of haze in the sky tonight, so I didn't get to view it long. I could see it south of here, but it faded into the night sky rather quickly. This thing was making no sound at all. I can hear jets and smaller craft very well when they are headed into the airport at PDX, which is only about a mile or so from here as the crow flies. I think the lights in the crescent may have been on the edge of one single craft. It was low in the sky, and if you held your arm out and hands about a foot apart that would be about the distance from the first light to the last. They didn't seem to be much brighter than an average star. I don't know what else to tell you about this one. I'm the only one home tonight so, I have no other witnesses. I would like to know of any others who saw this thing tonight.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

The LIGHT is the TRUTH!;2002-10-10 21:00:00;2min;The LIGHT is the TRUTH! Have you seen a UFO?  This is the truth, my friend and I did, exactly three years ago, Oct. 2002.  We were in a park and we saw a large star in the East sky the star grew in size instantly, and held size then grew instantly and held size it did this repeatedly about six times till it grew 3/4 the size of a Full moon, but at the brightest point it shot an INTENSELY BRIGHT white light down to earth, the beam of light had thickness it was about 1/2 as thick as a fullmoons width.   then it repeated its stair stepping but was getting smaller, holdingsize, getting smaller... about six times till it was the size of a Large star again, then it started moving it flew in an S shape up then back and  around smoothly, then it just shot like a shooting star straight, like light speed and it was gone.  This changed my life, I don't know and I know I don't know... but I do know there is more.  I would like to learn more, do you think that you could help us?  What we saw, NOTHING in Nature, or Nothing Man made that could do that, Humans just do not have that type of power and it was not an exploding star or something one could explain away. ... I am wondering all the time. What we saw was a show of control and power, There must have been other people who saw this, Its a big city a big state... but one problem is people don't stop to look up they are stuck watching tv... ?

MY HUSBAND AND I WERE OUSIDE OF OUR HOME, HE HAPPENED TO LOOK UP AT THE SKY THEN HE SAID TO ME LOOK AT THAT STAR MOVING. I LOOKED UP AND SAW THIS THING THAT LOOKED LIKE A STAR WAY WAY UP IN THE SKY. IT WAS TRAVELING TOO FAST AND HIGH TO BE A PLANE. WE DECIDED TO STAY OUT AND WATCH FOR A WHILE. SURE ENOUGH HERE COMES ANOTHER ONE. WE COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY WERE AT FIRST THINKING THEY ARE FALLING STARS BUT THE WAY THEY WERE MOVING IMPOSSIBLE. WE THEN SAW A BLUE LIGHT STREAK ACROSS THE SKY AT LIGHTNING SPEED. THEN THE OBJECT IN THE SKY WAS GONE. THEY MOVE SO FAST AND IN ALL DIRECTIONS. WE NOTICED THAT THEY WILL MOVE AROUND AND CHANGE DIRECTIONS. WE HAVE SEEN THEM SWERVE AROUND THE STARS, STOP AND HOVER IN ONE SPOT FOR A FEW MINUTES, THEN MOVE LIGHTNING SPEEDS.

Your other witness saw the object as she was entering I-5 southbound near Lombard St., about 4 miles sw of the tower at PDX.  My wife saw a white, circular object hovering in the direction of I-5 & Lombard, but she saw it near the intersection of 102nd & Sandy Blvd., about 3 miles se of the tower at PDX.  Could you verify the date with your other witness, because my wife is absolutely certain she saw this object at about the same time on the 5th (it was her day off work and she was running errands)?  Unlike you other witness, my wife did not see any fighter jets in the area, but it sounds like your first witness saw the object almost directly overhead, whereas my wife's line-of-sight was more like 45 degrees above the horizon.  Thanks and if I can answer any other questions, please feel free to contact me or my wife.  Kind regards, ((name deleted)) Gresham, OR  Please note that I have completed the rest of this form based on what the witness (my wife) told me.  I haven't checked any of the boxes, because none of the characteristics apply to the object she saw (she said it was a brightly lit white object that never changed colors) and although she wouldn't be opposed to speaking to an investigator and having her name released, she doesn't necessarily require that one contact her.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Object Hovering Near Jet-Trails 4/30/04, Portland, Or.;2004-04-30 18:30:00;10 - 15 minutes;Object Hovering Near Jet-Trails 4/30/04, Portland, Or. Around 6:30pm, while it was still very much light outside, we noticed a beige/yellow circular shape hovering around the trails of a jet that had flown by moments earlier.  It did not seem to be moving.  We kept our eye on it for several minutes, and it remained still.  We were making trips in and out of the apartment building, and we kept checking on it, trying to frame it at the same spot between a tree and a balcony in order to judge if it was moving.  Unfortunately, we did not see it take off.  We made another trip, and when we came back to the parking lot, it was gone. This event probably lasted 10 - 15 minutes. Another airplane passed above the object during this time. 6:30pm is an estimate.  We were facing towards the east not far from Union Station.  Today, I did a search on the internet to see if anyone had reported something strange.  I am not saying it was a UFO, but it was certainly weird, and I just wanted to report it just in case.

It almost looked like a bright city lamp post light.  The circle was completely still for about 10 minutes and appeared to be low to the horizon (over a tree line) so I could see it directly.  After about 10 minutes of complete motionlessness, the light became brighter and brighter and started to rise.  It rose very smoothly and at first slowly, gradually increasing its ascent upwards.  The movement was mostly vertical, with a bit of angle to it.  As it got higher up, I could see vibrant orange legs stemming from the center, looking a bit like spider legs.  In the very center of the yellow circle (underneath the craft), the was a red and green small light.  Once the craft started to ascend, it was out of sight (straight up in the sky) within about 3 minutes.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
High altitude,large than any other aircraft,silent and no marker lights or st;2005-01-18 03:33:00;45sec;High altitude,large than any other aircraft,silent and no marker lights or st I was looking at the mysterious white light in the sky as i have ben for the past 2 yrs. now. I also noticed several air craft inbound for PDX international airport.They where on approach with there landing lights on.As one of the commercial aircraft flew  over I looked to the south to see how close the next incoming jet was. MY vantage point is on a hill with a view to the south down the willamette river valley. The sky was clear to the south and light overcast to the north. A 1/2 moon was in the west lighting up the 3:30 am sky.It was when I glanced to see the other incoming aircraft that I noticed a large object several miles south and appeared to be at a very high elevation. This object was approaching very fast. faster and higher than the incoming jets. The first thing I noticed was the speed and size of the object then I realized there where no lights or strobes. No identifying marker lights at all. it was grey in color as it reflected or was lightly illuminated from the moon just off to the west of the object. I calkled to my friend who was just inside the front door to come quick. he looked up and immeadetly saw what I was staring at.He said what the heck is that there is no lights.Did it just fly over the inbound traffic pattern.( we are within 12 miles of PDX international and well within the TCA) Neither one of us could figure out what we saw other than a huge un marked grey flat bottom solid shape,high, very high altitude,extremely fast flying and totally silent straight line flying object. It flew from south to north straight line and if it remained on this path it would have had to have flown directly over the end of the runnway in which the commercial aircraft where approaching.Surely PDX tower must have seen this,even if it was at extreme altitude. I assume they would have anyway?The object flew directly over head but dissapeared behind the thin cloud layer just to our north. This object was too big, too high. too unmarked by strobes or any attention getting visuale marking and too quiet,silent infact, to be anything identifiable although we both had a very clear and deffinate view of the craft.

slow moving object over north west portland oregon;2005-08-06 20:30:00;5 minutes;slow moving object over north west portland oregon To whom it may concern.  While at work this evening (8/6/05)  at approximately 8:30 p.m. p.s.t. I was standing in the doorway of the business I work at catching some fresh air and watching people. About 5 blocks further North of us is a condo.  As I looked in this direction I viewed what I thought at first to be a plane emerging from approximately 1/2 to 1 mile from behind the building.  As I watched this plane I thought it to be moving too slow to be acting like an average small plane like a cesna type.  I kept watching this object as its flight path took it due South over N.W. 4th Ave over Downtown Portland Oregon.  My store is located on the corner of 4th Ave. and West Burnside Street and it took this object approximately 6 minutes to travel 1/2 to 1 mile behind the originating building which is located at N.W. 4th Ave. and Flanders Street (which is about 5 blocks North of my store) to being above my store.  The object was circular in shape.  Silver in color with a darker underside possibly black in color.  The top half appeared to be dome shaped and the underside was tubed shaped.  At the point when it was above my store it appeared to extend the tubing that protruded from the underside and then retract it.  The object emitted no sound or lights of any kind.  It was approximately 1000 feet in the sky and smaller than the size of a dime.  When viewing it from the street it was about 2 inches above my store which is a 2 story building.  The object was viewed by five other people including one co-worker of mine.  Several pictures were taken of the object as it approached my store and I am waiting for the film to be developed.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

About a month ago, I found a better way to present and share what I was trying to video tape that day. At the time I had submitted my report to UFOSNW.com shortly after the sighting, I only provided a snapshot image from the video because if this video is watched in normal speed , you just won't see it very well. I posted this bit of video recently on this link below, along with a LINKS to download the smaller portion of the video IN SLOW MOTION to show just the object: Please review this here: http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x22tmz_odd-object-near-contrail-july-10th   As mentioned on my report to UFOSNW.com, I did not know at the time of taping this, if I was able to capture it on video - because I could not find it in the camera lens viewer. But after reviewing the MiniDV Tape, I did capture a few frames of what I saw after all! I just did not know how I could slow down the frame rate of the video for better viewing of what I was tryng to tape. When I was taping this object, I guessed and zoomed in as best as I could where I THOUGHT the object was hovering near the contrail and clouds.  I know my report is very late in coming forth to you, but because of the other report I recently found on your web site I thought maybe I should also report this to NUFORC.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

As I sat there I looked out above my neighbors house to see two stars about an inch apart and one slightly higher in the sky than the other. Object A was very bright and the light from it faded in and out, much like a star Object B was much duller and both were too far to see any shape to them other than they were circular. Anyways, as I sat and stared Object A glided to the left and Object B followed, trying to keep the same distance they had before. Over a span of the hour and a half these objects moved left, right, up and down while gradually moving NE without breaking their original space in between. After watching them for that span of time, they moved out of sight.  I did notice that when planes or helicopters were in the sky, they stayed perfectly still, but moved as soon as they were a good distance away.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

I just saw a UFO.  I was walking down the street and I looked up for some reason and lo and behold: a black spherical object really high up in the sky.  It was kinda just moving around slowly like it was observing.  I kept following it with my eyes and eventually it got to the point where it was behind a tree and some buildings I couldn't get past.  At that point I was not sure and I thought it could be a weather balloon because it got slightly higher as I was looking at it.  So, I continued to walk my dog.  When I was heading back into the direction of my house I was able to confirm that it was a UFO because it was lower this time and I could see it clearly.   I followed it for a while with my eyes then eventually it moved across the sky and got higher and higher going in different direction that it disappeared.   It appeared as if it was doing some sort of observation operation by the way it behaved. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

They were fairly bright (white light, like metal reflecting sun), and I realized they must be craft of some sort in the high earth atmosphere realm, either going out to space or returning.  Definitely not airplanes, they appeared to be flying above aircraft altitude and were not blinking or moving in the straight pattern as airplanes.  They were circular in shape and exactly the size of stars/planets to my relative view.  They were about 20 degrees up from the horizon in the S/SE section of sky over SE Portland.  There were six to seven of them covering about a 10 - 15 degree area across the sky in roughly the same plane/area across the sky just above and to the right of the moon, but they were not moving in formation nor were they evenly spaced.  The three on the left side were in a triangular/Cassiopeia-like space and formation, and the others to the right were in more horizontal formation, but not exactly a straight line.  They all moved as if they were flying, but slow, not like a plane.  It was regular/straight-ish movement, as human/craft (plane, car, ship, people) would move.  It didn't in any way seem alien or weird.  They simply looked like six human craft.  They remained in roughly the same area in the sky, although they were moving a little bit in relation to each other, like if you're watching 7 people or animals in a group walking or hanging out.  When I first had looked up, I saw three bright ones and then the few fainter ones to the right became brighter.  A seventh moved in from faint to bright into the same realm and then back faint again.  They were visible in the sky for about 10 or 20 or more minutes, and then gradually they all became fainter and fainter and disappeared into the sky as they came, like craft flying out to space from the earth atmosphere.  My friend returned but only as they were disappearing - he saw 2 or three of them.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Stationary yellow-white ball of light over Portland, OR, emitting colors and no sound.;2008-01-26 00:05:00;5 minutes;Stationary yellow-white ball of light over Portland, OR, emitting colors and no sound. I live fairly near the airport so am quite accustomed to seeing planes flying near our home as well as military jets.  Last night while on my porch just after midnight I noticed an object that was more spherical than a plane would appear and significantly larger -- I would estimate about 5 to 6 times greater in size than an airplane would be at that distance.  I watched it for about five minutes and it did not move, nor did it become larger or smaller as a plane would have had it been moving.  It was spherical, gradually changed from white to yellow (much unlike the flashing of airplane lights) and emitted and aura and lights in hues of red, yellow-orange, white and occasionally blue around its periphery.  It appeared to emit an occasional small beam of white light, though not in any discernible pattern or consistent direction.  The best way to explain the emitting colors would be to compare it to a child's sparkler on the fourth of July.  This craft/light was silent, which again is quite unlike any airplane I am accustomed to seeing, particularly on nights as quiet and still as last night was.  After approximately five minutes, possibly a bit less, the light simply went out and I was unable to see it.  There was nothing obstructing my view of it so it is impossible that its view was obscured by a tree or structure.  The sky was clear and nearly cloudless (I could see many stars) so it's not possible that it went behind a cloud, either.  I came out several more times over the next two hours, camera in hand, but it did not reappear.  Unfortunately my husband was already sleeping so did not witness it with me.  I am quite curious to see if anyone else has reported seeing similar stationary lights in Portland recently.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Oregon 7:15 p,m disk seen 5-10 seconds;2008-07-04 19:10:00;5 seconds;Oregon 7:15 p,m disk seen 5-10 seconds An unidentified flying object was seen by my wife and I at about 19:10 on july 4,2008 from our dining room window looking south east while we were just finishing our diner. We live at an elevation of about 1000 ft. Our dining room window is about 6 ft long and six feet high. The object was traveling at an immense speed and was seen for about 5-10 seconds or less. It appeared to be circular in shape and of a size much larger than any of the many aircraft flying over our house from the south. It was high in the sky and flipping over looking black on one side and silver on the other. It was moving across our huge window in an easterly direction.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Silver objects flying near the sun;2009-09-27 15:00:00;40+ minutes;Silver objects flying near the sun I was laying at the pool of my apartments.  I flipped over to lay on my back and put my hand up to the sky to cover the sun when I noticed a small, bright silver flying object going across the sun at a pretty quick pace too fast for any airplane).  I thought it could be anything as it went very quickly out of sight.  I kept my hand up to see if I'd see it again and for the next half hour or so I continued to see these, all staying very close to the sun, not seeing more than three at a time.  I called my boyfriend to go outside and see if he saw any and he did.  He called his father who liveds in Tualatin to go outside, and he saw them too.  They never stopped flying around the sun but we went inside because the sun eventually hurt our eyes.  We would have taken pictures, but it wouldn't work because the sun was too bright.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

The craft was about the size of a F-16 but with no wings just disk shaped.  It was silver in color and really couldn't see windows for the hight in the sky, it flew from west to east then it shot strait up out of sight.   I was in the U.S. Navy for 10 years and have observed many aircraft in the sky and this was nothing I have ever seen.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Planet Sized Orb Passes Behind Venus Then FLICKers Out!;2010-07-25 21:00:00;about 1 minute;Planet Sized Orb Passes Behind Venus  Then FLICKers Out! I was looking up at Venus, and observed an pastel, pumpkin colored orb, which without consideration of distance, in size appeared to be about equal to that of Venus. It was moving from North to South in the Western sky, in the direction of the planet. I reasoned that it must be some sort of man made satellite, but then it appeared to pass BEHIND Venus, and flickered out!

I was looking straight south last night I noticed three lights, horizontal, in the distance.  I've looked at this view for over three years and have never seen this before.  They were small and moved up and down very slowly, I had to measure the movement and it was faint.  The light on the right side moved the most.  It occurred to me that they were at a high altitude.    Also, at about one o'clock from the position of the lights was a larger light, which flickered like a planet.  I watched these lights for about 10 minutes and went inside.  I returned an hour later and they were gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Green orb;2012-07-09 12:35:00;20 minutes;Green orb I stepped out onto my backyard around 12:30AM. The backyard faces north.  To the northeast I saw a green dot or orb between two trees. It was close to the horizon the sky was clear.  I thought it strange due to its color.  It was stationary for a bit before it moved erratically.  The movement was zig zagging up and down.  Very unlike any human made aircraft.  I thought maybe it was my contacts messing with me.   I moved around my backyard to get different points of view but it stayed up in the sky.  I then noticed an orange light that was stationary northeast of the green light.  The orange light was dimmer then the green light.   It had a beam of light attached to the green light. Both the orange light and beam of light faded out periodically.  Both lights were moving closer to the horizon and fading.  I assumed then that they were heading north.  I thought to call any of my friends that would be up.  My roommate works late and I called her she didn't answer.  I called my friend  and he was unfortunately drunk or high and didn't believe me.  During my phone call to my friend my roommate came home.  I hung up on my friend. Then  I ran out front to tell her to hurry the %Y## up and follow me to the backyard.  To which see saw the same thing I saw.  The green light continued to move erratically and fade from view.  I tried to convince my roommate to drive north to get a better view.  Unfortunately when we drove the city lights obscured any pin pointing of light.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

Then a third orb appeared behind the others and followed behind.  They then moved in a triangle like formation.   i was driving so only was able to watch for approx 30 secs. since we witnessed this,  i have talked to neighbors who have seen similar red and orange orbs lately in the portland area.   i cannot find a legitimate answer to what they were.   apparently a video of them were put on the local news, who also had no answer as to what these lights were. the truth is out there.
