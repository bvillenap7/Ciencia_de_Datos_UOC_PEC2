Large triangle remembered in Portland, Oregon;1976-08-11 21:00:00;20 min;Large triangle remembered in Portland, Oregon Hello, I have been trying to find information about an incident I witnessed in Portland, Oregon back in the summer (August) of 1976.  It was after dusk and my mom was showing me one of the planets that were really bright in the sky. She had gone back inside and after a while I happened to look up and noticed a large triangular object overhead. We were at my aunts apartment and this helped me with gage the size of it.  The length of the craft was 2.5 to 3 times the length of her apartment building and the width was about 1.5 the length of the building.  I hovered, making no noise, about 3 telephone pole lengths above the height of a telephone pole. There were lights on the underside and sides visible that I have not seen since.  I remember looking up at it and then looking down to street level, ( I was in back patio area) and looking to the street only 20ft away, I saw a woman walking west.  All she had to do was look up and she would have saw it.  I went back insi! de and told my mom I need to show you something. she came out and I asked her to look up.  She looked up a little and said What? I told her to look up higher  a couple times and she looked up and saw it. I remember the look of her mouth dropping open and me asking her what is it?  She said she didn't know.  We watched it and it did move ever so slowly still no sound. It was still there but she decided to go to the phone booth and called the news stations and although they said there had been thousand of calls they could give no info and directed her to call the national guard.  She talked to someone and told them what we saw but they would give no information on  what it was but did ask what our names, ages, location of sighting, and social security numbers. We returned back to the apartment and talked to my aunts room mate and I remember her turning pale, not talking, and leaving. Later she told of following seeing several in the 82nd and Division area.  Forgive me for bei! ng long winded I just wish I knew what it was. I have searched! for loc al articles but have yet to see anything resembling what I saw.  Even other triangle pictures do not look like what i observed.  Can you help?;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
If you saw the triangle I have described. It would be very wise to search your memories.;1979-04-04 13:00:00;a while;If you saw the triangle I have described. It would be very wise to search your memories. a huge triangle caft was seen twice. in 1979 and about 1995. it was reported the second time on a local cable show. when i was 7 or 8 (the first time) it made no sound. had no lights. it flew low slow and appeard to be the length of the empire state building (a very tall building) and equally as wide.   i saw the craft coming from the north. I saw it for only about 1 minute. (i later rememberd) i was taken up to the ship via some sort of transport device. the inhabitants were human looking. I was givin a non invasive medical exam. i remember laughing. i was then lead to a huge room where many children were. i was hooked up to a machine that lookied kinda like a large virtual reality machine. it came on and there were pictures, diagrams, equations, and many other things flashing at a high rate of speed. i have been able to recover some important info. like how the two and only two types of space vehicles work. there is alot more info. it only becomes available when something trigers it. i believe there is a process of education occuring.

elongated triangle ship spotted around 1981, 3 witnesses.  it put us in a daze making it hard to think;1981-06-01 21:00:00;15 seconds;elongated triangle ship spotted around 1981, 3 witnesses.  it put us in a daze making it hard to think i think i was about 9 years old.(im 31 now),and me and my mom and my little sister came home at about 9 or 10 pm.  it was dark, and we saw this weird looking space ship slowly flying towards us. it slowly flew over us, and when we looked up at it, we saw its belly.  its belly was rigged with all kinds of contraptions, like machinery, wires, tubes, lights, video screens, and mechanical looking stuff, and it was flying pretty low over are field.  we lived on a 9 acre farm up on skyline blvd, kind of out in the country.  anyways, it put us in some weird kind of trance as we were staring at it, but when we opened the door and got inside our house, we all just sat down, in this weird daze. finally, i forced myself to say, mom, did we just see a spaceship?, and she said something like, ya, i think we did.  i felt like my brain was fighting through 10 pounds of sludge just to talk or think about it. it was very strange.  it also made a humming noise as it passed us, like the low hum of machinery, and for the size of the thing, it looked like it shouldnt be able to fly that slow.  i would expext something that big to fall from the sky if it was going that slow. the shape was like an elongated triangle (pointed end leading), and it was a little longer than a jumbo jet, and about twice as wide, but lacking the shape of a jet, and granted , i dont know anything about the mechanics of alien ships, my gut feeling about this one , is that it looked like something that was made here on earth.  all the mechanics on it just had a made in the usa sort of feel to them,  but i really dont know.  anyhow, the next day, i think 11 other people reported the same thing, and the hillsboro piper airport said they didnt know anything about it, and i believe there was a little blurb about people seeing it on the local news channel the next day. im not real sure about the date, but it must have been sometime between 1980-1982.

It was triangular in shape, but hard to describe, because of so many different angles.;1998-05-02 22:45:00;3 seconds;It was triangular in shape, but hard to describe, because of so many different angles. Well, it was not my plan to report this, because I have never in my life seen something like this, and figured no one would believe me.  After listining to the Art Bell show last night I figured why not so here I am.  I work for a hospital in the Portland area.  I start work at 2300 hrs and usually arrive around 2245 hrs.  On this night I pulled into the parking lot, and began my short walk to the engineering shop where I work.  I am not sure why, but I just happend to glance in the sky, and I saw this object traveling across the sky at an increadiable speed.  It was not real high.  I would say about 500 meters up.  It was solid black with a strange triangular shape with a lot of sharp angeles.  It had no lights on it at all, and made no noise what so ever.  It traveled from the south to the north, and went from my field of view within 3 seconds or so.  It gave me the chills because I know I did not imagine what I just saw.  I was able to see it because there was a heave cloud cover this night, and the city lights put a white glow on the clouds.  When this solid black object came across the sky, it was not hard to miss against the city lit clouds.  This object was fairly big.  I would say about 75 to 150 feet long, so it appeared to me.  If you do happen to call, please call after 1700 hrs.  I wake up at 1630 hrs each day.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

Triangular shaped object viewed through a telescope after initial sighting by 4 adults.;2000-09-14 21:00:00;2-3 minutes;Triangular shaped object viewed through a telescope after initial sighting by 4 adults. While sitting outside on a deck at an approximate elevation of 400-500 feet above the Wilamette river looking to the East, 4 adults including myself witnessed an object crossing over head slightly South of our position. It moved at rapid speed from west to East toward the river. We discussed it's speed and at first thought it to be a satellite however as we watched it pass without sound we agreed it was too close to be a satellite. At this point the object slowed considerably to what looked looked like a stop and apeared to have some color qualities. At this point approximately 45 seconds after our first sighting, I became more puzzled as to what the object might be. It was too fast for conventional aircraft, made no noise and now had stopped. The sky was overcast but the object was visible the entire time. It had stopped approximately over Mt Scott at which time I asked my brother in law if he had binoculars, he said ther was a telescope inside. It was just inside and on a tripod. I quickly brought it outside to the edge of the deck. The object was still stationary and as i began to look it apeared to turn brightlights directly our direction. I was able to get approximately a 4 to 7 second clear look at the object. I was actually  shocked to see see the object through the telescope so clearly. It was not an airplane. It had a bright red light at the top of a triangular shape with many smaller lights running at angles down the sides creating the shape of a triangle. It actually looked more like a cone with small strings of lights running from the top point of the triangle down to the base. It was not moving very much toward the north so my brief vision was amazingly clear. When a actually realized what I was looking at was not an aircraft, I simply said to the group just that, that's not a plane, it then moved to a point where it was obstructed by the house in front of us. I ran with the telescope 1 short block to a view spot at the end of the street where there was a 180 degree view looking East, bu! t was un able to find the object again. I could see however all the incoming aircraft to Portland international. There is actually a good deal of aircraft activity visible from both the deck and from the end of the block. It was easy to compare what I had seen to the other aircraft and I became even more clear the differences between what I saw and the aircraft in the area, both looking through the telescope and to the naked eye. A strange feeling indeed.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Triangle shaped object drops from sky during meteor shower...possible abduction.;2001-11-19 02:30:00;5 minutes;Triangle shaped object drops from sky during meteor shower...possible abduction. 11/19/2001 2:30AM Portland, Or. Triangle shaped craft We have received mail from a young man in Portland, who, while laying outside watching the meteor shower had a very unusual event occur involving a triangular shaped craft which dropped out of the sky to a position directly above him at an estimated distance of 15 to 20 feet. The craft was described as having a red light like thing all the way around it and a black dome in the middle that turned white. He says there was no sound coming from the craft at all and, after what appeared to be about 5 minutes, it left as he heard the sound of a car coming in the distance. OUFOR contacted this witness and gathered a few more details from him. These are his words... During the 5 minutes that I lay there in surprise, I had a strange calmness come over me as well as a tingling feeling. When the black dome became white is when the tingling occurred. It couldn't have been more than 5 minutes though that's what it seemed like. I ran into the house afterwards, but I didn't tell anyone because they would just laugh at me and say I'm full of it. Nobody, including myself, believed in UFO's until that night. I have had dreams both nights since it has occurred, of the craft, and also I have seen aliens in these dreams, but that is probably my mind seeing pictures of things I've seen before and adding them in. The main reason I reported this is because I wanted to know if others saw the same. This now appears to be the third report of UFO activity in this area, the second of a triangular shaped craft seen during the meteor shower and the third from a sighting that was reported on August 1st which included two videos taken of the same craft on the same day. Analysis of that video have shown that this craft was found to be cruising the same area as this young mans physical address 3 months before his reported encounter which seems to be an abduction situation on the surface.

Red triangles of light that straightend into column.;2002-01-14 18:40:00;2 minutes;Red triangles of light that straightend into column. I saw what appeared to be two triangular sets of red lights. They appeared to 1500 to 2000 feet overhead. I felt a deep, almost subharmonic vibration as they went over me, there was no audible sound that I could hear. They tracked directly over me while I was outside on my cell phone to a freind. As we were talking they increased thier speed traveling in a north bound direction, at the same time the  lights seemed to seperate and form a straight line/column. They then shot off into the horizon. I spent 10 years in the USMC, have seen numerous types of US & foreign aircraft. These bore no similarity to anything I had ever seen before.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

It was of similiar shape as a fighter. as it banked I saw a flashing red light similiar to Passenger jet's blink maybe twice and, at same time I saw two circular lights on bottom of craft. it was quiter and slower and a different type of shape than i'm used to seeing. i pretty much watch the sky every nite. i've seen a few ufo's in my life. one very dramatic in ca. and i seen alot of planes. this one was different enuf to wonder about. the one other thing i'd mention is that the type of evening it had been for me was consistent with my experience with my previous sightings. there was a little something simpatico about the event of my evening.  in a playful way things seemed a touch otherly, if u know what i mean. don't  let anyone tell you what you've seen is readily explained. trust your eyes and your instincts.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Silent Triangle over Gresham/Portland Oregon remains motionless, rapidly accelerates away. ((OREGON/MUFON REPORT INCL.));2003-08-29 22:30:00;7 minutes;Silent Triangle over Gresham/Portland Oregon remains motionless over hill then rapidly accellerates away. On August 29, 2003 at 10:30 PM I was traveling east to west on SE Division St. in Gresham Oregon, towards Portland. The sky was clear and cloudless At the corner of Hogan and Division I noticed an unusually bright light to the west.  At first I thought it might be an airplane, but it was not traveling on a flight path that would have taken it to or from the Portland International Airport.  Continuing on Division St. I noted that the light had not moved, and what I first took for a plane was actually stationary. I could now see that in addition to the bright white light, a smaller blinking red light was visible parallel to the white light. Was it a helicopter hovering? I live about three miles from where this light was and am familiar with the area, and I knew that there was no antennae tower of any kind on this hill that would account for a stationary light. On August 29, 2003 at 10:30 PM I was traveling east to west on SE Division St. in Gresham Oregon, towards Portland.  At the corner of Hogan and Division I noticed an unusually bright light to the west.  At first I thought it might be an airplane, but it was not traveling on a flight path that would have taken it to or from the Portland International Airport. Continuing on Division St. I noted that the light had not moved, and what I first took for a plane was actually stationary. I could now see that in addition to the bright white light, a smaller blinking red light was visible parallel to the white light. Was it a helicopter hovering? I live about three miles from where this light was and am familiar with the area, and I knew that there was no antennae tower of any kind on this hill that would account for a stationary light. The closer I got to the light I could definitely tell it was not moving at all.  I decided to find the first turn to the left (south) to see how close I could get.  I had my digital camera with me and it was my intention to photograph.  I turned from Division onto NW Angeline St. (southbound)  The street was lined with many tall fir trees and I could still see the light intermittently through the trees. Hoping to hear if what I was seeing was just a hovering helicopter, I turned off the radio and fan, and rolled down all of the car windows. I contiuned south on Angeline until I came to NW 5th where I then turned left (east). Now I had a very clear view of the object.  I could now see that it was triangular in shape with two bright lights on two of the corners and the red light was on the third corner. Luckily I wasn't the only one to see this thing. Two men who were standing on the left side of the street (NW 5th) were looking up at the object.  Further down the street, a car was slowly moving toward the object with the driver looking up towards the triangle.  Two girls, who were running down the street behind the car, were also looking up and pointing. With the windows rolled down, I tried to hear what, if any sound the object was making.  It was absolutely silent.  Over the years I have seen Police, News, and Rescue helicopters flying all over the Portland area.  If this were a helicopter hovering over a quiet residential neighborhood it would have been terrifically loud at its altitude.  The most striking thing besides the silence, was the incredible stability of the object.  It sat so still you would think it was affixed to the top of a tower. Helicopters hovering have a bit of wobble and drift, however slight.  This was rock solid.  I can't stress this point enough. I have seen pictures of the Phoenix lights, the Belgium Triangle, Lubbock lights, etc, and this was very similar.  While it was not possible from my point of view to discern surface details, it appeared to be very large (fifty to one hundred feet or more across) and an equilateral triangle.  Since I was looking up at the object, it was not possible to estimate the height or thickness of the triangle. As I moved further east on NW 5th, the triangle suddenly started to move. It may have been a reaction to so many people all moving towards it at once. But it may have been a coincidence. It pivoted on its center to face to the Northeast.  As is turned it began to accelerate.  Again, it was absolutely silent.   And what was the most striking was the weirdly perfect precision of the turn.  Not like a helicopter that will wobble slightly while turning, then tilt forward to accelerate.  This move reminded me of the too precise way a computer simulation can be. (If done wrong)  In film and television computer animation, an animator will intentionally add small bumps, tilts, or wobbles to make the animation seem more real or lifelike.  This thing turned and began moving in one smooth perfect motion.  If an animator produced a motion like this, it would be rejected as too smooth and fake looking. I tried to follow it by taking the next available left turn (onto Towle Rd) and continued north.  The street was lined with fir trees and it was rapidly moving to the NE making it difficult to see.  Towle road has numerous speed bumps, so it was not possible to keep up.  As I reached Division St. (the street I was originally travelling on when I first sighted the object) I could see two bright white lights of the back of the triangle.  The red light was no longer visible, so I assumed it was either off, or that it was on the corner pointed away from me.  (Was it the 'front'?)  I turned left on Division St. and was now traveling east to west again.  As there are houses and trees along this part of Division it was difficult to keep track of the triangle.  As I approached the intersection of Birdsdale and Division I could see that it was now what appeared to be two to four miles away moving faster to the NE.  If it continued in that direction it would have come very close to Portland International Airport and the Air National Guard.  Within a few seconds it was gone from sight.  It was now 10:37. I am certain it was not a plane or helicopter.  The complete lack of any sound would rule those out as possibilities. A Harrier Jet might be able to stay relatively still and then accelerate something like this did, but not stay completely motionless.  Plus the Harrier is quite loud hovering. Was it a blimp or some sort of balloon?   Even blimps and balloons hovering make some movement.  This was sitting rock steady in one spot.  And the speed at which it accelerated would have required some sort of jet or prop engine.  This was silent.  Absolutely, completely silent.

This is a probable unconventional or unidentified aerial object (UFO).   Although conventional aircraft were positively in the area, this is near the PDX approach pattern, and also near the Troutdale airport.  Conventional aircraft are in this area all the time, and local residents are accustomed to seeing them.  One witness also observed and clearly identified a commercial airliner that flew over minutes after the sighting of the unknown object.  Both witnesses agree on basic details, essentially that a triangular object with lights near the corners, hovered over a residential area at well under 1,000 feet (the FAA mandated minimum altitude above terrain).  This craft hovered silently for several seconds, then departed rapidly in a northerly or northwesterly direction.  Full report (minus witness identities) available on request.

7 very fast moving lights over Portland Oregon!;2004-08-09 00:50:00;5 SECONDS;7 very fast moving lights over Portland Oregon! Hello:  At about 1250 to 0110 am on August 9 2004 I was sitting outside on my deck smoking a cigarette.  A small flash of light caught my eye in the sky between my trees and the neighboring apartment roof.  I looked at the lights about seven in all as it moved just a few degrees off south.  The lights were white in color, and in a V pattern.  I stood up because the lights were moving very fast, and I was going to loose sight of it.  My first thought was that it is a very fast airplane, but I couldn’t hear any noise, just that of the city.  I couldn’t tell how far away the lights were or how big the object was.  As I watch trying to think what I was looking at, it moved straight to the west (right) without any wing tip or signal.  It was as if it was going forward then just moved to the right without stopping.  I just said what the hell, still trying to make something out of what I was seeing.  The lights then began going out as if the object had some thickness.  The problem with this I couldn’t see the object.  This I can explain, after all it was very dark and if the object were black I wouldn’t be able to see it in the dark sky.  This incident only took a few seconds and the object moved very fast.  My only explanation would be a B2 bomber with landing lights on I just can’t explain the turn.  Thank you ((name deleted)).  I already filed this report earlier today.  I forgot to say that when the object turned it continued to head south.  It just jumped to the right.  Sorry for not being more careful.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

I saw a triangle shaped object apear from clouds and suddenly stop.I looked hard because of its size,and the fact that it stopped on a dime.As if it realized it was no longer hidden in the clouds.The color im guessing was dark, like blackish.The size was like (two)or (three) 747 airplains put together. Im able to approximate its size because off to the left was a comercial jet.Anyway this craft hung there for about (4) seconds,then with one movement it went straight up fast. Im talking really fast.The weard thing is it went point first like an arrow,but it was horizontal to the ground. But when it took off it was one movement,as it shot straight up it sort of changed shape.It was longer than it was wide,and probably about 300ft off ground. I saw no exhaust, nor did i hear any engines or jets.WoW.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Glowing orange triangular object with orbs in each corner travelling south to north;2007-08-14 00:45:00;10 seconds;Glowing orange triangular object with orbs in each corner travelling south to north In the early morning hours of Tuesday, August 14, 2007 at approximately 12:45 a.m. my husband, a friend of ours & I were in our backyard watching for meteors. The friend & I were sitting facing east to northeast & I witnessed a large triangular shaped object with three orbs located in each of the corners silently fly across the sky, traveling in a south to north direction. The object appeared to have a soft orange glow about its perimeter as well as around the orbs.  The event only took about 5-8 seconds to occur & what we found most stunning was the fact that it was absolutely silent as it traveled. We live somewhat near the airport & hear a lot of air traffic. This object however was perfectly silent & given the late hour, there wasn’t a lot of ambient noise in the neighborhood.  In the time it took the two of us who witnessed the event to simultaneously say, “what was that!?!?” the object disappeared behind a large tree in our yard & was gone. Needless to say, it rattled both of us & we proceeded to describe it to my husband. Our descriptions were identical. We then went inside the house where we both independently drew what we saw. The pictures are eerily similar (drawings submitted separately).  We hope that, due to the meteor shower activity over the past few days, other people may have been looking into the sky that evening & can substantiate what we saw. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and she seemed to us to be exceptionally credible.  We have invited the other witness to submit a report, as well.

Three triangular bright orange light objects hovering low in the sky: Portland, Oregon.;2013-03-09 22:05:00;45 seconds;Three triangular bright orange light objects hovering low in the sky:  Portland, Oregon. At 10:05pm, I walked out of my home and saw three very bright lights hovering low in the southern sky.  All three of these light objects were distinctly triangular in shape.  Each of the three objects were projecting bright orange light in the center surrounded by bright white light at the outer edges. The lights were extremely bright and were facing due north. The orange/white light of each was constant and did not blink or flicker. From my vantage point, they were visible slightly above the roof line and to the left of house across the street from mine. These three lights were hovering far lower than any aircraft I'd ever seen in the downtown Portland skyline . The lights were large enough in the sky that they appeared to be possibly fewer than several miles away in the distance.  I noticed all three of these shapes were slightly swaying in a back and forth  in a fluid horizontal motion but stayed the same size, and kept the same position in the sky. This lasted approximately 45 seconds after which time,  within three seconds, all three of the lights moved very close together without touching, rapidly decreased in size (but without out moving from their relative position in the sky) and then proceeded to completely vanish from the horizon. During this occurrence I also I observed that there were two aircraft with blinking red lights flying in the southern sky from east to west. The two aircraft were fl! ying much further off in the distance and appeared to be moving at a constant speed which I considered to be consistent with commercial aircraft. I heard distinct sound from the two aircraft in the distance but did not hear any discernible sound from the three other light objects that I witnessed. Note: My home is located 4.5 miles North or downtown Portland, Oregon. I am a 36 year old mother of two, I formerly worked in the field of counseling, and I have never before observed anything unusual in the sky. I took one photo and one short video clip with my camera phone. The objects appear white and round in the images I captured, which may be due to the image quality.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

IT COULD NOT BE THE BIG DIPPERS HANDLE BECAUSE THE LIGHTS WERE TWICE THE SIZE OF THE NORTH STAR.   AS I CONTINUED TO DRIVE ON THE FREEMONT BRIDGE TOWARDS SALEM, I SAW ONE OF THE FOUR LIGHTS DIM AND THEN DISAPPEAR.  THE THREE REMAINING LIGHTS SLOWLY MOVED INTO THE FORMATION OF A TRIANGLE.  AFTER FORMING THIS TRIANGLE I COULD SEE THE SHAPE SLOWLY TURNING OVER PORTLAND.  NO NOISE COULD BE HEARD OR NO DEFINITIVE VEHICLE OR PLANES COULD BE SEEN, ONLY THESE THREE LIGHTS WHERE THE POINTS OF THE TRIANGLE WOULD BE.  AS I HIT THE SYLVAN EXIT, NO LIGHTS COULD BE SEEN ANYMORE, BUT A SMALL STATIC CAME UPON MY RADIO THAT HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE PASSING THE ZOO I SAW MULTIPLE CARS ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD POSSIBLY STOPPED TO SEE THE SAME THING. AFTER THE LIGHTS WHERE GONE I COULD SEE 3 OBJECTS THAT LOOKED LIKE PLANES FLYING IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS WITH A GREEN FLASHING LIGHT AND A SOLID WHITE LIGHT. ALSO SEEN WAS A RED FLASHING LIGHT THAT WAS SMALLER THEN THE NORTH STAR THAT WOULD FLASH PERIODICALLY AND THEN TURN BLACK.

Two bright hat-shaped objects hovering then flying away in Portland.;2014-11-10 22:45:00;15 minutes;Two bright hat shaped objects hovering then flying away In portland Around 10:45pm, I was biking home from work(Alberta area). My rout home takes me through the top part of Irvington neighborhood.  The very first thing I noticed was flying very low, like a helicopter and was very loud.  But it did not look or sound like a helicopter. It had very bright red lights on top that were glowy and vibrant.  White lights on bottom.  It was moving fast and I followed it for a couple blocks out of my direction and it disappeared from my sight behind houses.  I allowed it to get away and continued biking home.   Once I reached the very top of the hill near Alameda, I decided to stop because it's a good place to see the sky.  I wasn't assuming I had seen anything extraterrestrial, more that it was truly bizarre.  I was only standing at the top of the hill for less than a minute when straight ahead of me (facing south) I saw a very, very bright light.  I thought it was a satellite. It was staying in one place and not seeming to move at all.  It was s! haped like a hat almost, pointed on top, similar to a triangular shape.  I stared for a very longtime, then noticed to it's left was the same object, slightly lower.  Meaning there were two.  I started filming and trying to take pictures on my iphone that are hard to decipher due to all of the other lights around. I also called my boyfriend to tell him what I was seeing. After almost 15 minutes they started moving in a west direction, pretty quickly. So they were not stars. Definitely not planes. (At least not the usual commercial flying planes). Last night (11/14/14), two days later I was driving home with my boyfriend, when straight ahead in the sky, we saw the exact same two shapes on the exact same place moving the exact same way. We both watched together as they stood in one place for a long time, then began movingn together in the same direction out of sight. This was all from Irvington Neighborhood. I am reporting 3 different sightings in this post. 2 on the same night. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

I was coming through what we call the tunnels into downtown Portland.  As I was coming out of the East Bound tunnel, I saw what I cannot explain.  The thing I saw seemed to be a massive triangular object.  It had multi-colored lights on each point of the triangle which seemed to me to be at least 150 to 200 yards apart.   In the middle of this object was a bright white light coming from the middle pointing to the ground.   I caught this sighting just as it was ascending back into the clouds, the thing I remember most is that when it was moving back into the clouds I could tell that it was a solid mass  because it was darker than the clouds it was acending into.  This lasted 4-5 and happened straight in my view while driving.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

V shape light formation materialized and zoomed off to north at incredible speed, Portland OR;2019-10-27 17:55:00;2 seconds;V shape light formation materialized and zoomed off to north at incredible speed, Portland OR Was camping. Looking at the stars directly overhead, I was thinking how people could easily hallucinate or think they saw a ufo becasue of tricks the stars play on my eyes from city lights. Several minutes later, a shape materialized, it looked like lights floating to the surface of a body of black translucent liquid.  It took about a half second to come to full brightness, and was a V shape light formation with a leading light at the apex, 4 lights down one leg and 3 down the other. The lights were of the magnitude of a very bright star but a little yellower. As soon as it came to full brightness, it zoomed off to the north with absolutely no acceleration-instantly coming to full speed. It was about the size of two full moons in length, one in width, and I only saw it travel an arc-second or two before view was obscured. Absolutely no sound, makes me think it was either insubstantial in mass or above the atmosphere. Cell phone not affected, listening to podc! ast as it happened, texted immediately after.Very clear night, no clouds, moon not in sky, city lights obscure all but top mag stars.

With the naked eye it appeared as a single stationary red light, appeared about the size of a light on a low flying aircraft we see in the area, assumed to be the light from an aircraft, possibly a helicopter but it appeared much to high and there was no movement.  Decided to try and get a photo, zoomed the camera lens and found it to be three lights in a triangle, two red lights one green.  These were self illuminated.  Watched for several minutes using the stationary silhouette of a tall fir tree to discern movement, the light appeared stationary. Went in the house to download the photo and then checked 15 minutes later and it was gone.  Nothing on the local news, sent photo to local news station weather department, as of 24 hours later no response from them.
