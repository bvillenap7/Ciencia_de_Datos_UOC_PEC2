As I walked 3 blocks to triangulate width and altitude ,it never moved. This thing must have been a mile across and skirting the atmosphere. 25 minutes, enough time to gather 5 witnesses (Two of my daughters visitoring from Albuquerque) and observe this non moving craft. We tired and went about our day. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
2 V-shaped objects with bright lights seen near NW Portland.;2001-02-26 01:34:00;2-3 minutes;2 V-shaped objects with bright lights seen near NW Portland. The 2 UFO's were first seen when my roomate was out on the fire escape of our apartment complex smoking.  The 2 objects appeared to be stationary for about 2 minutes in the sky to the South.  I got my camera and when I came back out the objects began to move North towards us.  The objects appeared to have 3-5 very bright white lights on the bottom side of the craft and turned without banking.  They were V or boomerang shaped objects.  No flashing and/or colored lights to classify it as a plane.  The objects were flying very low and made no sound.  I managed to get two pictures before they dissapeared around the side of our building.  We ran out to track their movement but they'd already vanished.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
bright as a red flare , chevron shaped, silent, 1000 ft over my house and stayed for 30 min..caught on video tape.;2001-08-06 23:00:00;30 minutes;bright as a red flare , chevron shaped, silent, 1000 ft over my house and stayed for 30 min..caught on video tape. It was bright as a flare, hovered over house and was completely silent. stayed in the area for 30 to 45 minutes and then drifted up and into clouds. Part of the sighting, near the end is on Video tape. Was not a balloon, flare star, swamp gas or other riduculous explaination. It was an unknown, not of earth. My fiancee and mother all watched it as it hovered over the house and then over the tree line and hung in the sky for 30 to 45 minutes. As I said, the last part of it was caught on tape. I would be interested in getting the tape magnified and thermal imaged to see exactally what it was. Through the bincoculars it looked like a cheveron shape, black, with a red..bright as a flare that seemed to hang from under the bottom. The light or whatever it was did not blink.

Blue/White Object at high velocity/low altitude.;2002-08-13 02:00:00;1.5 Seconds;Blue/White Object at high velocity/low altitude. Traveling 20 mph eastbound through lit residential neighborhood in vehicle.  An object was noticed directly overhead, also traveling eastbound and disappeared from view (due to large trees) at an approximate 45 degree line of sight.  Object would have been considered to have been at low altitude (approx. 1000 ft.)and traveling at high velocity within field of view for 1.5 seconds. The colors varied from a soft blue glow at the center that radiated out to eventually become white. Streaks from the rear outermost points were also white.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Red and white floating object suddenly and extremely rapidly zips away.;2009-04-18 20:13:00;30 seconds;Red and white floating object suddenly and extremely rapidly zips away. I looked out my front window and saw a glowing red and white light floating, but not staying exactly still. It seemed to wonder slightly around the sky.  I worked with air planes for six months, i know what plane landing lights look like.  This was not normal lights, im also in the military.  This was not any military craft i have ever seen.  After about thirty seconds it flew away faster than i thought possible.  It appeared to go East.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
