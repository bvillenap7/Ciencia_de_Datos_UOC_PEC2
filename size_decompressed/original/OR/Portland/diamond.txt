Four lobed blue-black object seen moving south at dusk;2004-07-08 21:07:00;4.5 minutes;Four lobed blue-black object seen moving south at dusk On July 8, 2004 at 9:07 pm pdt, I was puttering around the backyard when I looked up and saw an object blue-black in color, no apparent lights, moving to the south somewhat slowly, not as fast as the typical single engine airplane, moving slowly and deliberately.  It appeared almost overhead, but shifted about 60 to 70 degrees above the western horizon, low enough to be easily seen.  As an object it seemed a bit large, or a bit close, say 1000 to 3000 feet altitude, and made no noise.  The object did not seem to rotate much about its own axis.  Visually, it had a squarish, or four lobed appearance, like a diamond shape, with a larger sphere in the middle.  This was evident when it was at its closest, when I first glanced up and saw it.  It was startlingly large.  I observed it for nearly 5 minutes from overhead to losing it behind a house roof.  Two pictures are either attached or sent separately by email, Pict5704.jpg (optical zoom 10x) and Pict5708.jpg (4x additional digital zoom, 40x total).  Lighting conditions were near dusk, mostly blue sky showing, a slight 1 to 2 mph evening breeze.  If interested, more photo data is available.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Strange Diamond shaped object seen in Portland, Oregon;2006-04-30 00:20:00;3 seconds;Strange Diamond shaped object seen in Portland, Oregon I was unable to sleep, and thought to look out at the night sky around 12:15 am while waiting for a show on TV to come back on. I was looking out my living room window that faces East. From this window I can see a bit N, NE, E, and SE. As I turned my gaze to look in the SE direction, I saw something quite bright, large, and moving very fast suddenly appear. It came from the SW direction heading East from my window view. It was at a 35 to 45 degree angle from where I was, and flying LOWER than what the helicopters or small planes do in this area. This object moved much too fast and silent to be man-made. When it first came into my view, I thought Wow! A shooting star! But as I watched it, I realized it was too big, and too low in the sky and flying horizontally - this was not a comet or star. Also it had a defined “shape” to it. There were NO flames, contrails, or light streaks coming from behind this object. It had an intense yellow-white glow around the diamond shaped object. I could also see something faint and darker, in the middle of the object as shown in drawing. I did report this immediately to another web site along with a drawing of it here: http://www.ufosnw.com/sighting_reports/2006/pdxor04302006/pdxor04302006.htm  I just found out from reading NUFORC's web site that others may have seen this same object as well. So I thought I should also submit my report to NUFORC for this reason.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Daylight sighting: silent, black diamond flies over Portland, Or;2006-07-20 20:45:00;15 minutes;Daylight sighting: silent, black diamond flies over Portland, Or My friends and I were standing together and talking at the local dog park when I noticed a black object in the northwest sky.  It was moving to the south (over and parallel to Freeway 5, perhaps?) close to the same speed and altitude as most local small aircraft traffic (I am just a few miles from PDX). It was not what most would call a spectacle. It was black, had a diamond shape with four rounded edges and had no lights, no visible features (tail, landing gear, windows) and it produced no audible sound. The sun was setting at the time and the sunlight on the bottom western edge of the object produced a warm orange glow on the surface despite being black. It left me with sense that the object had a matte rather than a high-metalic surface. My friends and I agreed that the object was not a plane or a helicopter. We considered the possibility it was a baboon. The wind was mild and steady and coming from the Northwest. The object was moving more directly to south, It follows, the winds aloft would have to have been moving in a somewhat different direction than the wind on the ground - and I realize this is very possible. I could just about cover the object with the tip of my index finger at arms length. And from this vantage point in could most certainly have been a diamond shaped balloon. However, I would think that such an odd shaped object would be more likely to tumble through the air rather than glide. Nobody was particularly impressed with the event. Nevertheless, I felt compelled to report it on the off chance that somebody else may have gotten a better look at the object and needs corroboration.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
saw & filmed a pulsating diamond shaped object which changed shape several times over Portland, Oregon about 9:30 PM;2010-05-18 21:30:00;7 minutes;saw & filmed a pulsating diamond shaped object which changed shape several times over Portland, Oregon about 9:30 PM Saw a stationary object while driving home, which was too close and bright to be a star.  There were no other stars visible in that portion of the sky.  We pulled the car over and watched the object for about 5 minutes before proceeding home about a half an mile to get the HD Handycam to film it.  Recorded it on film for about 7 minutes from our backyard over the roof of the house behind us.   The object changed shape several times and pulsated brighter, mainly staying in a diamond shape.  There were also dark vertical lines which crossed the object periodically, and there was a darker circle or diamond shape in the center the object sometimes when the object was in a diamond shape.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
((Hoax??)) Oblong hexagonic shape, 3 lights, odd cylinder bump on bottom of craft.;2018-10-13 23:45:00;1 minute;Oblong hexagonic shape, 3 lights, odd cylinder bump on bottom of craft While writing electronic music in my studio, I looked out to see a strange aircraft flying close and low outside. Could have been a f-117, but looked as if it had a strange cigar with a cross bubbling from the bottom of the craft.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Small, star-like object appears in Oregon nighttime sky.;2021-03-18 00:00:00;6 minutes;Small, star-like object appears in Oregon nighttime sky. I was standing on my back deck, bending my neck about half way up to look at the stars.  I always look at the stars at night when the night is clear. That night, it was pretty clear so I admired the stars. However, upon admiring, I noticed a very small object I perceived as a star but then later realizing it was an unknown object, perhaps a craft. There are very tall pine trees in neighboring yards, the sky was a medium night sky blue with little grey clouds, and this unknown object was hovering right above the top point of a pine tree. There were few clouds out that night and the object was in front of a small, grey cloud. I thought I saw it slightly moving and thought, “ It’s just how stays shimmer.” I was mistaken, I froze in a sort of fear and every time I saw the object move, I became terrified, shouting, “No!” Every time. The object was a little bigger than a star, it seemed to look like that on purpose. It was diamond shaped, with the bottom coming to! a point. It would move side to side and up and down as it moved side to side, you could see the outline of the shape of the object. I felt as though this was something most people weren’t supposed to see. I’ve never felt this way about anything. It was intelligent, with its moves and shimmering, like it wanted me to notice it, like it was playing a little game. If shined bright like a diamond, like a star, no lights, no flashing, just a simple object replicating a star. The next day, I noticed two small places in the area looking for something. There are no coincidences. There’s always a small aircraft flying around my neighborhood, we see it every night. This object I observed was not something I’ve ever seen before. Although I believe the event lasted around six minutes, when I came back inside my apartment, I realized time went from 12:17am- 12:49am and I know I wasn’t out there that long.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
