Big black object that came apart and molded back together.;1999-07-26 16:00:00;about 10 min.;Big black object that came apart and molded back together. It was a little lower than a plain would fly, and it looked like a solid black circle. Not like a saucer, which is a flat circle. It was like a ball you would bounce, perfectly round. It was about the size of a big tractor. It didn't go fast at all. It looked to me, like it went a bit faster than a blimp. Then, out of no where, it broke apart, in formation. Like those jets at airshows do. Like it was showing off or something. The things that broke off looked the exact same as it did when it was whole. Except smaller, and there was a lot more. They went a little faster though. Then about a minute later, it molded back together, so it was big again. After that it started going higher and higher, and it eventually disappeared. And the exact same thing happened a year before around the same time of day, in the same month of summer. Except only one was here the first time. And both times it was over my house. We called the local weather center to see if they had scheduled any weather balloons to be set off, and they hadn't. Both times. Also, both times there were absolutely no lights on it that we could see.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
In bright daylight, bright  object observed-thru binoculars it looked wierd-second bright object traversed path of first.;2001-07-22 14:40:00;20 minutes;In bright daylight, bright  object observed-thru binoculars it looked wierd-second bright object traversed path of first. I was lying out tanning. I saw a bright object that seemed to change shape. I called out my 13 yr. old son. While he kept track, I got out the binoculars. Using them, it seemed that there were several smaller bright objects clustered. Since it was moving in the general direction of the one high cloud(although at a different speed), Maybe a weather balloon? Another bright single starlike object came into the binocular view. This thing approached then went by the first thing. This was at a right angle to the direction of the first object. I'm 45 yrs. old., and a manager at a grocery store. My son will go into the eighth grade this September. Total time observing the first object is about 20 minutes. The second object came and went within 1 to 2 minutes. My son says that the second object looked like a moon.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Six fiery, glowing objects, some at a standstill, then all six of them moved very slowly over the city of Portand, Oregon.;2006-04-29 23:50:00;20 minutes;Six fiery, glowing objects, some at a standstill, then all six of them moved very slowly over the city of Portand, Oregon. First there were two of them. One of them was at a complete standstill as the other approached. When the one caught up with the first one, another appeared from the left and headed toward the two which were now both at a standstill.  As the third one neared the first two, all three objects started and maintained a very, very slow flight pattern. The first two were now going the same way they had come before the third one finally caught up. We followed all three and then noticed a fourth one appear from the left and it finally caught up with the other three objects which appeared to be heading south. They all looked like bright orange glowing objects. They almost appeared to be on fire. They looked like big stars. They got smaller, then bigger, and then smaller again.  As we followed the four objects we had to stop at a stop sign. We looked up and directly above our car there were two more of them. We could still see the first four to our right as they were still flying very slowly.  The two above our car were at a complete standstill.  About one minute later, they then started towards the direction of the first four and moved very, very slowly. We followed them as they appeared to be heading in a SE direction like the first four. At first they were glowing like big stars and then got smaller.  One looked like it was above the other as they left slowly in the distance. We first started seeing at least two of the objects as we were going to take the Couch St/Burnside exit from the 405. We took the exit and went left.  This took us to Couch St. We followed the objects all the way down Couch St to Broadway. We then took a right and parked in a lot to see the final two as they disappeared.

First time ever seeing these types of glowing objects!!;2006-04-29 23:50:00;15/20 minutes;First time ever seeing these types of glowing objects!! I was in the backseat of my friends car when I witnessed two of the glowing objects. My friend was exiting Couch Street and that was when she called my attention and another friends attention to the out if the ordinary view outside. When she called my attention, I could see the objects but now there were four of them. The objects were orange and glowing at the same time and they were at a complete stop. But then they all started to move S/SE. They were moving very slowly. As my friend turned left on NW Couch street, she slowed down to get a better look at them. She kept on going straight and on about 14th and Couch Street, she came to a complete stop. All three of us that were in the car were able to get a better view of the glowing objects. They were two more directly above the car. I noticed two of them. They were at a complete stop for about a minute or so. Then the objects started moving S/SE following the previous four objects. They were moving very slowly as if drifting. They were glowing orange, but it was hard to see any definite shape. The glow was in slow motion. One of the objects got smaller and then bigger again. After they started to move S/SE, we proceeded E on Couch to 10th street. On 10th street, we were at a three way stop. Four of the objects were above a white building. We watched them for at least three minutes. We proceeded E to NW Broadway were we turned right into an abandoned building's parking lot. My friend in the passenger seat called 911. They told her to call the UFO center in Wa State. The driver of the car called the UFO center and made a report. I watched the objects at this point, but they faded away as they were headed S/SE.

I saw at least six bright glowing, orange in color objects in the sky over the city of Portland on Saturday night, 4-29-06.;2006-04-29 23:50:00;15-20 minutes;I saw at least six bright glowing, orange in color objects in the sky over the city of Portland on Saturday night, 4-29-06. I was driving my car and coming into Downtown Portland from the 405 Freeway. I was heading to take the Couch St./Burnside St. Exit. Just before I approached the exit, I noticed to my left in the sky at about a forty five degree angle two very bright, orange in color objects. One was at a complete standstill. There was another object, closely approaching very slowly as if to meet up with the object standing still. It came from the south. When it reached the first object it then was at a standstill with the first object. Then coming from the North, a little farther left from the two objects that were at a stand still, was another object which looked exactly the same as the first two. As it neared the first two objects, the first two objects started to move away very, very slowly to the south as the third object was heading closer to them from the north. I noticed an airplane, which came from the north and heading south near the now, three objects. I couldn't tell if the airplane was going to fly under the objects or just near them.  I also wasn't sure if the airplane was flying towards them to check them out or if it was just there coincidentally at the time.  The airplane was smaller than a passenger airplane and looked to be flying considerably low. I could see the lights and the shape of this craft and it definitely was an airplane. The other objects were not like this airplane at all. The objects looked like they were a little higher than the airplane. I really can't say how high the plane or objects were. The plane flew past the objects that were heading south.  Then I noticed a fourth object coming from the north just behind the third object as I took the Couch St Exit and turned left onto Couch St. heading east. I followed the four objects as they were heading in a S/SE direction. I was still heading east on Couch St. The four objects were flying very, very slowly now to my right at about a forty five degree angle.  I came to a stop sign on Couch and I looked directly up from my front windshield at about a 90 degree angle and noticed two more objects directly above my car. They were bright, orange in color objects that appeared to be fiery, or on fire. I really tried to get a focus on them, but could only notice the glow and haze which seemed to be in motion, almost like a candleâ€™s flickering. The two objects were at a stand still. I know this because I was at a complete stop, too.  About one minute later the two objects proceeded very, very slowly to the S/SE. They also started to change in size of glow. They got smaller and then bigger again as they headed S/SE.   When they got smaller they looked more like stars.  The other four objects had  just left my view as I noticed the two objects that were directly above me.   A few blocks down I came to another stop.  I kept waving to cars on my right to continue after their stop as I was at a four way stop.  Me and my two friends were watching the four earlier objects as they moved slowly, S/SE above a  white building that had  some  radar like items and other things on top of the building.  The objects looked like they were much higher than the building as their glow got smaller as they moved S/SE.  We were at this stop sign watching for about three minutes or so.  Then we proceeded down Couch street to NW Broadway and along the way would still notice the objects as they headed S/SE.  I turned right at NW Broadway and headed into a parking lot that used to be a Burger King and my friend called 911.  They gave her the phone number to the UFO Center.  I called the UFO Center in Washington State and gave my report.  As I gave my report I was watching the last two objects  that at one point was right above my car, fly off in the distance heading S/SE.  They looked like two stars flying away in the distance with one on top of the other.  They looked to be about an inch apart as they drifted still very, very slowly and then eventually fading away.

From the heart a rare and ever so ,WOW!;2007-02-17 08:00:00;7 minutes;From the heart a rare and ever so ,WOW!   driving north bound on I-205 61/2miles due East of downtown Portland, I noticed large non blinking well lighted flying object,the flying object slowed to a halt changed color codes,shapes, and disappeared.The flying object then reappeared after about 15 seconds clearly visable.Although the rain clouds were present at 1000ft,the flying object did not go behind any cloud,throughout the encounter this flying object continued to change it's color, codes, and shapes.The flying object was silent but you could sense it's presence.During the duration of the 15 second absense of the flying object, I swiftly turned to the right to see a 1 mile paralell ball of fire ,that was traveling at my vehicles speed.This object remained visable through anything within it's course,then it disappeared.{It had the character of what would look like a comet} I look back to the leftof the night sky to see almost as if in a slowmotion effect the visual image appear again of what I'm assuming is the previously reappearing flying craft.At this point I watch the flying objectidentify itself with one position,one shape,and four large red circular lights.There were three red lights on the bottom and one light on the top of it.

2-3 colored lights on one craft swooping gracefully in irregular pattern looking west/nw from North Portland, OR;2012-11-06 20:00:00;>10 minutes;2-3 colored lights on one craft swooping gracefully in irregular pattern looking west/nw from North Portland, OR from North Portland on the second story of a building, looking fairly high into the western/northwestern sky around 8pm, my friend and I saw lights, multiple, changing colore - red, blue, green -- apparently one craft, making swooping, rolling moves.   Perhaps two lights or three, with colors changing.  Appeared to be on the other side of the Willamette - perhaps far away to the west/northwest.  It swooped down, and to one side, then up, to the other side - graceful slow movement.   Finally, as I was talking to the local news station (KATU-TV)it gradually dropped toward the horizon, at a curving angle until I could not see it anymore behind the trees and tall house to west of our building.  Appeared rather far away, could only make out the movement and the colored lights (no more than 3 clustered together in no discernible shape).;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Very bright red, blue, and green object accompanied by loud hum, moved quickly and then came back, six white circle lights too.;2014-06-06 23:50:00;10;Very bright red, blue, and green object accompanied by loud hum, moved quickly and then came back, six white circle lights too. Accompanied by a very loud hum, an object appeared rapidly in the sky and was very bright, three rectangle squares of blue, green, and red, sort of arranged in a diamond shape.   It moved very quickly far distances and came back, but its lights always facing down.  The very loud hum continued.   When it disappeared from our eyes, we could still hear it.   It then came back again.   All of a sudden six very white dome shaped lights appeared arranged in a circle, then all rotated.  We saw white beams come down.  It then quickly disappeared.   Lots and lots of dogs were barking.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

I saw a bright star rapidly changing color in the sky, it was so bright that the other three witnesses, (who are nearly blind,).;2017-08-08 22:00:00;2 hours;I saw a bright star rapidly changing color in the sky, it was so bright that the other three witnesses, (who are nearly blind,) could see it.   I used binocular glasses to watch the craft.  Throughout maybe 12 minutes, I could see it split into multiple crafts, morph color and shape, and shoot another brighter craft outward.  The new craft quickly disappeared completely.  I used Morse code to send it messages, to which it would often respond with numerous things.  I first told it that we are peaceful, and that we would like to see it do something.  It quickly blinked very rapidly and brightly after that. Seconds later, the craft that earlier disappeaed came back.  It flew close to the ground in a zig-zag pattern.  Soon after it once more vanished completely.  After that, it went back to flashing and morphing around.  I asked it to make a sound, I then heard a noise that sounded like a repetitive bloop bloop.  It stopped after I noticed a light floating behind a nearby tree.  At one point it peeked out and flashed a light at me that seemed to resemble the flash on a camera.  At this time the other three witnesses had left.  I had left when I started to hear a loud ringing noise in multiple directions.   Out of curiosity, I came back a few minutes later and the main craft was completely gone.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

Three pulsating spinning lights hovering above se Portland video taped.;2020-07-28 04:30:00;Nightly;Three pulsating spinning lights hovering above se Portland video taped. I video taped these lights, three of them, in different parts of the sky above my house in S.E. Portland, then I zoomed in to clearly see what they were.  They seem to be in a spinning movement, moving different direction in quick spurts, yet staying in the area for long periods before disappearing.  They change theyr shapes, sorta like they were pulsating open and closed.  When open you could  see they were somewhat spiral in shape, yet I cought one on video from the side, and from that angle looked more like a curved dome forming out with each pulse.  No sound at all.  I have video of all three. They are up there nearly every night.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
