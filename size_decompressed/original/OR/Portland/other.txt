At approx. 18:35 when leaving work for dinner, I saw at least 6 contrails in formation very high directly above Portland headed generally towards Seattle.  The last was still being created as I watched.  I live in view of Portland Int. airport and a military air strip near by, and have not in the decades I'ved lived here seen that many con trails at once.  I also noted it because while they did appear to be very high, I could see the craft better than I thought I should be able to, as though they were unusally large, they seemed longer than they should be, but they were so high I could not hear any sound from them at all.  I noted it in the back of my mind and went on about my business, until Art Bell came on and I heard about the large sighting in Seattle a couple of hours later.  Wondered then to myself if someone may have known what was about to happen, and was on their way to take a look.   Then later when the caller from vancouver said he'd seed that unusally moving 'craft' at about 14:00 that afternoon I really became convinced I should report this, just in case anyone else noted unusal military looking activity that night.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Stationary object over downtown Portland Oregon, white in color shaped like 3-pointed star or Y.;1999-08-17 05:50:00;15 min;Stationary object over downtown Portland Oregon, white in color shaped like 3-pointed star or Y. At 05:50 on August 17, 1999, I was standing on a sidewalk across the street from the baseball stadium in downtown Portland Oregon, waiting for a bus.  I looked up at a twin-engine Cessna climbing out southward (roughly 1500 feet as it passed overhead) and noticed a small speck apparantly far above it.  At first I thought this was sunlight reflecting off a high-altitude jet.  (While it was quite light enough to read, the sun was not yet actually over the horizon, so it would reflect from a high-altitude object even though we were in shadow.) I watched to see whether this jet was going south or north.  (Almost all high altitude air traffic here is to San Francisco or Seattle.) It did neither, but rather stayed in one place.  After a couple of minutes of this, I checked to see if the scattered cirrus clouds were moving. They were drifting slowly westward.  At the surface, we had a breeze moving from north to south.  In either case the object should have drifted (if loose), but did not. I looked carefully to see if I could detect any bobbing or any air patterns that might indicate this was something much smaller and closer, such as a tethered balloon, but another airplane went by climbing out, and passed between me and the object, so I concluded that it was likely higher than the plane.  Also, I saw no bobbing movements or shadows anywhere indicating a tether.  (They might exist, but I did not see any.) After a few minutes, the angle with the sun had changed enough that I did not get a specular reflection, but a diffuse one.  The object appeared to be white, and shaped like a Y.  On the other hand, it was extremely small and so I can't guarantee that I wasn't seeing glare or artifacts from my eyeglasses. About this time the thing seemed to rotate a little bit, then move a few feet, and then hover again, as though it were under control and keeping station.  It repeated this behavior occassionally until I lost sight of it. The object continued to stay in place, with no noticable changes, until my bus came at 06:05, when I lost sight of if.  At this point, other boarding passengers asked what I was looking at, and so I pointed it out.  Two saw it right away, both shrugged.  At about 06:15 I tried to find it again after I got off the bus in Northwest Portland, but was unsuccessful. ====== end of report I have the feeling that this was some kind of recon aircraft, but it's the frist sighting I've had I can't actually explain away.  I'm a licensed pilot, have a degree in physics, have done professional photojournalism, and now write software.  Even if I'd had a camera, there wasn't much to take a picture of without a very long lens. The phone number is at home.  If you call, please do so in the evening, when I'm likely to be home.(not that this sighting needs much work ...);45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

seen while walking home from work.;2000-05-07 03:45:00;5 seconds;seen while walking home from work. Greetings. While walking home from work I seen this U.F.O.  The U.F.O. I seen was just a pin light speck in the sky around 500 feet in the air.  It was real bright and traveling around (guessing) 30 mph.  It was traveling in a north to south direciton.  The bright white light it emited stayed on for only about 5 seconds and then slowly dimmed till you could no longer see it.  My brother has told me that Soviet satelites will do this but this object was within our atmosphere.  I had my camera with me, but there was no time to get any picture.

Yellow slow flight pulsing bag object above 35000';2000-08-06 18:00:00;10 minutes;Yellow slow flight pulsing bag object above 35000' Looked at moon with 10x minolta binocs. and noticed unusual object. Motion was from approx W to E. Elevation over 50k ft. ?? . Looked like yellow plastic bag at first. Had to lay on my back on the lounge to keep clear focus on object. The yellow thing was pulsating from round or full to narrow and skinny. This pulsing seemed to be moving it across the sky. A regular pulsing like breathing. Maybe one second intervals between fat to skinny.  Not visible at all to the naked eye. After it passed the moon I watched it till my eyes got tired and I wanted to see how far from the moon it had progressed. I found it once more with a bit of effort only to loose it for good. I wouldn't say it was any sort of space craft. It almost looked alive, or some sort of naurally powered thing. It may have been flying garbage. At the elevation I estimated, it could have been quite large. It seemed unusual enough I wanted to report it to see if anyone else has seen anything like it. ????????;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

We talked for 15 min. about the shower and best locations to watch it when I finally got off the highway from a work trip to Gold hill, OR. that day. Suddenly they in Boise started seeing lights shining from the north and it seemed to resemble manifestations of the Northern Lights. The lights started shooting out beams of light from the north over the horizon seemingly up over our heads and to the south as we all in both cities looked to the north. WE started noticing rings or bands or pulses of glowing fiant lights bands roling down from the north. They seemed to have no end in sight either east or to the west and were seem exactly at the same time in Boise as in Portland. It was 1:00 AM by now and my wife and I went down to an industral area of east Multnomah county. My wife by the way has had 1-1/2 months of coughing and resporitory distress and is now or antibiotics and getting worse all since the past months Chem-trails. Anyway we watched through the smog and days sun evaporated moisture haze lit up by all the 1:30 AM street and shopping center lights and could see clearly the pulses or waves iregularly but seemingly with some pattern radiate out fromm the north. My son and wife in Boise, ID. clearly confirmed at the same time on cell phone the pulses of faintly glowing tubes or bands of 1/2 a knuckle wide light rushing south ovewr all our heads to the south. My son Zeb and Tim my daughter-in-law have tried to record with a quality Sony digital camera and got some weak images. They are trying again Sunday morning in the clear S.W. Idaho skies and better adjust the camera to get better images of the waves. The waves or pulses sweep the full arc of the sky from north to south in 1/2 to 1 second but yet their glow was distinctly visible as they rushed across the sky in multiple patterns of waves like a code or maybe just totaly random yet it seemed to have a pattern. So going out now to check the sky. One never knows what might happen, do one? Always, ((name deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  We have received several reports that appear to us to address the same phenomenon.  Our best guess is that the witnesses were observing the particularly dramatic Aurora Borrealis that occurred on this morning, and which was reportedly seen as far south as Los Angeles.  Since the solar wind, which causes the Northern Lights travels at hundreds of kilometers per second, one might expect the phenomenon to propagate very quickly across the sky when the charged particles encounter the Earth's magnetic field.

Strangeness of it was that there were absolutely no lights or sound coming from it as it skimmed across the sky no more than 100' from the ground. It had to be large enough to be seen in the same area of view for about three seconds. When I called for a friend to see this, it was already gone. I could definately tell that the nose had a point of a type, but could see nothing further in the way of detail.

US Shuttle being followed?;2001-08-14 21:45:00;15 MINUTES;US Shuttle being followed? I heard on the radio that the US space shuttle would be visable in a fly-over in my area, so I went out back of our office at the approx. time so I went out back of our office and sure enough it flew over as expected. The interesting thing is that at arms length approx. 4 behind the shuttle, I could see a faint dot following at the same speed, I have seen this before a few years back when the US shuttle had just separated from the Russian MIR station. It was not announced that it would be visable with any other US or Forign craft. It is supposed to be visable all this week, I'll keep looking. (Interesting but not Earth shattering) ((NUFORC Note:  There is a possibility that the Space Shuttle and the International Space Station were close to one another at the time of the sighting, either docking, or separating.  We will attempt to confirm this possibility.  Both objects are quite prominent in the night sky on a clear night.  PD));45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Bright Aqua ball of Light over Hillsboro, Oregon - viewed from Cornelius Pass - Danced in the sky;2006-03-13 21:30:00;not sure, seconds;Bright Aqua ball of Light over Hillsboro, Oregon - viewed from Cornelius Pass - Danced in the sky I heard coyotees howling very loudly outside so I opened the door to see if I could see them in our yard. I walked out on to our porch (which is on the second story of the house) and I looked acrossed the street (which is on a right angle from our house)when I realized the sound was coming from that direction to see if the coyotees were that way. Out of the corner of my left eye I caught something in the sky that looked bright. It was falling in a straight line from left to right yet at a downward angle, it appeared to be in the sky over the Beaverton or Hillsboro Area. It was just above the line of a tree in our yard, and over the lights of the town. My first reaction was that it looked like a HUGE shooting star but then my brain connected that it was not white but a very bright Aqua (blue green) color.. not a regular blue.... and it was pretty big.... much larger than any falling star I've ever seen. Sort of a firey looking bright aqua colored light. I yelled for my family because the door was still open and I really didn't know what I was seeing. It lasted long enough for me to think they would actually be able to get to where I was at and see it, but at the last moments ...as it seemed to get to it lowest point it suddenly swooped back up in a circle (rounding over itself and coming back around), then in a kind of figure eight and then basically made a bunch of very eratic moves...in a really much faster and crazier pattern. honestly the closest description I can give is that it looked like a ballon losing its air... a kind of crazy dance right at the end... and then it just disappeared. Before it did the circles though it was going very straight and fast at an angle towards the ground. It was very clear .... no clouds skewing my view..... and I saw it distinctly. I don't know what it was, so I won't even speculate, but I can say I For SURE saw what I saw and know it wasn't any kind of plane or ballon or regular aircraft I've ever witnessed before. It left me feeling pretty odd since it was so big and in such plain site. No matter what it ends up being I'd love an explaination!;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Bright sun-illuminated dot drifting over S.E. Portland, Oregon;2007-07-06 16:40:00;1 minute;Bright sun-illuminated dot drifting over S.E. Portland, Oregon On 6 July 2007, at approximately 4:40 PM (Pacific Daylight Savings Time)in the afternoon, my wife called me on our house phone (I was upstairs, where I was working as usual at our home-based business), using her cell phone, to say that she say a UFO, and that I had better get out there (where she was: on the back deck) pretty quickly or it would probably no longer be there. I thought she was perhaps joking, as less than a minute or so previously, she had called me to ask me to take a look at the good job she had done constructing a makeshift sun-screen to protect the plants on the deck from the excessive heat and sun.  (The temperature was in the mid 80s, relatively hot for this area the sun was quite bright). I thought her second call might be a way to get me to show up outside quicker than I might do ordinarily. When I was outside, she pointed into the bright, blue sky, where a quite bright dot was drifting slowly in the sky, very generally in an S or SE direction.  The dot appeared to maintain very generally the same apparent altitude.  Although much sunlight was apparently reflected from it, it was difficult to make out any size for the object, as if it were extremely bright but extremely far away or extremely tiny in spite of its brilliance. The object did not appear to vary noticeably in brightness during the time it was observed, which was perhaps a minute by myself, and an additional (preceding) minute by my wife.  The object showed no signed of rotation, or any sort of jerky motion that one might expect e.g. a helium-filled balloon with some sort of attached string to exhibit while being (presumably) buffeted by the wind. The air in the vicinity of our house at this time as not particularly windy, but also not necessarily totally calm. The angle of the line of sight was about 40 degrees, and certainly no more than 45 degrees the line of sight was essentially parallel to the slope of the roof on the back (SW) portion of the second storey of our house.  The object was seen to be about one half to one inch about the slope o the roof, as estimated via fingers held out at arm's length. In discussing the sighting briefly with my wife, I referred to the object as being exceptionally shiny, although she referred to it as being very white, which I would agree with.  The color of the reflection seemed (to me) to possibly be strongly suggestive of a metallic-type reflection. Seeing the object did not result in any immediately-obvious other-worldly sensations it seemed unusual to be seeing such an object, and there was some degree of discomfiture in not being able to classify it as to the sort of thing it was, or why it was there, or what it was doing, etc. The sky at the time was generally cloud-free, and certainly in the ESE direction toward which we were looking and where the object was seen. The object appeared to drift in the sky, until it was obscured by the upper leaves of some neighboring trees and then no longer visible. The object drifted perhaps two inches (per at-arm-length finger measurement) during the time it was observed it was not moving particularly quickly at all.  It was most certainly not stationary, however. Attempts to contact a local (or any) FAA Flight Service Station to obtain information regarding the magnitude and direction of the winds aloft were unsuccessful, as all that was apparently readily accessible over the phone was prerecorded weather information for the vicinity, which gave just the surface winds(?), which (if I noted this correctly) were 310 (the heading presumably) at 12 (MPH?) for Portland (Oregon), or at 6 for Troutdale (Oregon). This report was submitted about 6:40 PM, two hours after the incident.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
odd orb on horizon at sunset;2008-02-17 17:00:00;>6 minutes;odd orb on horizon at sunset A ball of slightly colored light shone above the horizon which at first I took for the sun shining through the clouds. But the sun, as it turns out, was farther south on the horizon. I've seen a rocket take off from afar leaving a trail of gases which refracted the setting sun's rays, and this looked like that in magnitude, color, and intensity. Except this was a discrete, albeit diffuse, orb. Anomaly is on west horizon above hills at five o'clock pm looking from 39th and Powell. It was quite odd. Initially I could have sworn it was the sun behind clouds. Cellphone photos, once on computer, bear out weirdness. Go figure.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

T-shaped,y-shaped,triangle,three lights,daytime.;2011-08-24 09:00:00;<1 minute;t-shaped,y-shaped,triangle,three lights,daytime While driving to work today, I saw a UFO. I still can't believe it. Around 9AM, I was headed SE on Highway 30. I was running late for work due to sleeping in and my having to stop to get gas. Before I reached the Sauvie Island bridge, I saw what looked like a plane in the sky -- white, glimmering, about the right size.  This may sound unusual, but since I was a kid I've looked at planes and always waited to see their wings. This time, however, it remained sort of roundish and slowly turning, since the light reflection looked like it was changing. So I started to wonder if it was a helicopter but very high up. As it turned, it slowly got darker -- and suddenly it was gone. Since I was driving, I really couldn't scan the sky much to find it. I kind of smiled to myself that it was sort of like a UFO sighting. As I got closer to Linnton, however, I saw the thing again! The experience was the same only it took place over about 10 seconds instead of 30 or so. Again, it started out glimmering, then turns, goes dark, and was gone. At this point, I was curious. Did I just lose track of it before? Because I was driving slow this time, I was able to search the sky a bit. Nothing. I got my first stop of the trip at the Kittridge intersection. I look up again and I see the darn thing a third time! This time I had a better chance to watch it while the streetlight was red. There were clearly three lights and a Y- or T-shaped frame that looked like a gray plane without its nose. The lights made me think of the classic triangle UFO for a moment, which I thought was pretty weird. All of a sudden, the lights on it go out one by one. At first, it seemed like it had disappeared again. But I squinted and I realized that I could see it flying away SE -- a little more East than I'm facing. It was fading away into the sky's haze and moving very fast. I'd say fast like a jet, but the horizon haze gave me the impression it was higher and faster than jets I've watched. I eventually lost sight of it in the distance. The light turned green and I didn't see it again. I hadn't thought to take out my iPhone to snap a picture. Each time I saw it, it was a surprise. And obviously I couldn't take a photo while driving. Nonetheless, I saw it clearly and my head is spinning a little bit thinking about what it was!;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

I observed the following by eye & through binoculars.;2013-01-01 00:01:00;2-3 minutes;I observed the following by eye & through binoculars. Whilst watching the New Years Fireworks from my 2nd story which affords me a good southerly view I noticed two orange lights flying in sync along the southern horizon. I know what aircraft look like as my home is in a flight path for PDX airport. My interest was piqued as the lights differed from the planes that I see as they were not red or white but orange.  First the two objects were flying east to west in a formation which seemed quite strange i.e one of the lights was low on the horizon and behind the other light that was higher up from the horizon, plus they seemed to be flying at a fast speed, not zipping across the sky at an unfeasible speed but faster than planes tend to go . Another brighter, whiter light that I took to be a plane flying along the normal South to North air route for Portland International airport was flying to the West of the orange lights and didn't garner my attention until it started to fade out,  I don't know how but it was there then started to diminish and was gone.  At this time the lower light was no longer there (I don't know how it went it just wasn't there anymore) whilst the other kept along the east west path it was on and too faded out of my view. Then I saw another light that seemed similar to the two previous orange lights much lower on the horizon, for about 20 seconds which then dropped away from my view beyond the horizon. Shortly after this a plane one with the white and flashing lights came into view and flew an arc westward over towards Portland City Center.  This gave me the impression that the other lights I saw were quite a ways off and going much faster than this plane. I viewed the orange lights through my binoculars and did not see the red and white flashing lights that planes normally have.  It may be that they were aircraft that did not exhibit the normal night time lights, but these had no flashing lights on them, were in a formation and seemed to be moving fast. I wanted to put this up as I am intrigued to see if any other folks saw this or have an opinion on what I saw.

Then a bout 30 seconds later there was 3 of them far away, and 2 right next to each other and they were going downwards really slow the opposite way from the airport!

Four Lights/Objects in Night Sky Over Portland;2013-06-23 00:21:00;90 seconds;Four Lights/Objects in Night Sky Over Portland I looked out my third floor apartment's west-facing windows on this very cloudy night and initially thought I was just looking at stars, so I didn't think much.  I quickly remembered there were no visible stars as my wife and I had discussed earlier in the evening when we were wondering what our chances of seeing the Supermoon were going to be (which were zero in our neighborhood of Portland it was simply too cloudy). So, I do a double-take, get up from the couch and walk to the window to look out to the northwest at these four orange-ish red lights seemingly hovering in the sky.  I say to my wife, “Are those...what are those? Come here!” By the time she gets to the window one of them has moved higher and disappeared, so there are only three lights left. They hovered in the sky, eventually moved up over the next 90 seconds or so and then disappeared. These were not planes or stars. Shortly after the lights disappeared a plane was flying rather close to the horizon heading east, and it was clearly a plane with flashing lights.  The previous four lights were not blinking or flashing and moved up out of sight, not to the left or right.  I don't know what they were but they were certainly unlike any flying object I've ever seen!;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

While I was driving I looked towards the east at about a 75 degree angle from Earth.  What I saw at first struck my curiosity due to the shape of these craft and how they seemed to hover slowly above with no sound. I spent 6 years in the US Navy.  I was trained in the field of Electronics Warfare.  In that field I had to be able to identify Air, Sea, Subsurface vessels by silhouette only.  So when I saw what looked like a string of lights hanging down from the sky but they appeared to float slowly over the sky.  What struck me as odd was first the lights how they went down vertical instead of aircraft lights going horizontal across the sky. I at first only saw one that was in front of my vehicle off in the horizon at like I said 75 degree angle from the earth’s surface.  Then to the SE I noticed two more floating about 5000 meters apart.  From my vantage point.  Then they began to move in a counterclockwise movement through the sky like they were surveying the surface because one of them came as low as the Hard deck of 2000 ft. Altitude.  Then I looked in my rear view mirror and noticed another in the West behind me.  Then off to the North was two more for a total of five making what seemed like a continuous motion still lights vertical.  In a counterclockwise movement, one I noticed began to hover over the Airport of Portland or near the I-205 bridge going into Washington state. The lights draped down vertical with first row of lights going down being white, then a second row was red, then a third row was white with a fourth row that was green. What made me question that they couldn’t be planes is how the lights that seemed to be to the front of the vessel.  Would in unison begin with the first row of lights going down then going up while the Red ones went up while the next row of white lights went up as the row of green lights went down as they illuminated.  I saw one as it seemed to begin a turn and the vessel was shaped on the front where the lights were with a sem-circle front that shaped downward with flat like sides. What really was odd about them was how they would move almost like floating then do a maneuver of 180 degree turnaround and head back the opposite direction.  So I called the Police they told me to call UFO Center and the Airport Air Traffic.  So I called the Center first.  Was asked if I had a camera to capture on video?  I had my Windows Phone with a great camera on it for a phone.   So I got off the phone and began taping the incident.  I was able to capture almost 5 minutes of video.  I did not think I was getting it but I did.  So later as I arrived home I called the FAA and they told me that the Police had Cesna 172’s up chasing bad guys.   So I looked them up to see the fuselage shape and lighting.  There is no way these were Cessna 172s.   I am sure after viewing my video coverage you will see what I mean.  Especially the one I caught overhead of my apartment how it moved across the night sky.  When I arrived home I noticed more further up in our atmosphere 10 more just stationary.   I hope this helps the center with their research into this incident.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Red/Orange Blinking orb over the North/Northwestern sky in Portland Oregon;2014-02-02 18:00:00;15 minutes;Red/Orange Blinking orb over the North/Northwestern sky in Portland Oregon In the North/Northwestern sky, somewhere between 17:30 and 19:00, a blinking red/orange orb was witnessed.  It was kind of low on the horizon and would blink, the way a planet or star blinks.  I can saw with pretty much certainty it wasn't an object in (Outer) space, due to the fact it was pretty cloudy and overcast.  You could not see any stars or the moon.  So taken from that, it had to have been in the atmosphere.  Anyways, It was blinking brightly, then would slowly dim, while still blinking, till it blinked out, so to speak. This would happen over the course of 1 - 3 minutes.  Once it blinked out, it would be gone for like 4 - 5 minute, then reappear, all of a sudden, in what seemed to be the exact same place.  This went on for at least 15 minutes, that we (the ones who witnessed it) were outside. To be left off the record My wife and I, who witnessed the event, are believers in ufo/aliens/other life existence besides earth.  I personally have never seen anything, nor would I wish to draw attention to myself or my wife.  With that being said,  My wife did take a video of it along with some pictures, I can get from her and send via e-mail.  I have selected the option to have a return call, but if done so, please do it between the hours of 13:00 - 22:00 PST.  Thank you;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
14 lights of various size, shape and color over Portland, Oregon;2014-06-22 18:30:00;15 minutes;14 lights of various size, shape and color over Portland, Oregon. 14 lights of various sizes, and mostly white, were covering about 10 range in the sky. A group 4 adults, 2 -17 year olds and my 14 year old son were sailing on the Columbia River near Portland, OR, when one looked up at the wind indicator and alerted everyone to what he thought were a group of skydivers.  Many points of light and one was crescent shaped, like a modern parachute. As we kept watching we realized they were not getting any closer and there were some that appeared either smaller or farther away and two were red, for a total of 14 items. All of these items pretty much kept their scattered distance as they slowly proceeded from east to west but the odd thing it the crescent shaped object rotated very slowly…perhaps twice over the 15 or so minutes we saw them. I thought that with the height of the sun, it may be reflection off some space debris but when first spotted, the convex side of the crescent object was illuminated but when it rotated 180 degrees the convex side was still illuminated, but should have been in the shadow.  Also, the two red objects were very bright red. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and he sounded to us to be quite sober-minded.  We suspect that he is a very good witness.

Strange shape UFO sighting over PSU Park Blocks;2015-05-15 01:18:00;10 minutes;Strange shape UFO sighting over PSU Park Blocks I was sitting on the fire exit at my building outside on the eight floor and staring at the stars while practicing breathing techniques.  I saw two stars that were close together, kind of similar colors, and I admired their beauty.  Then, I noticed one was kind of moving away from the other... Which stars don't do...  So I kind of laughed at myself for mistaking something for a star and continued my breathing techniques.  So I started wondering what it could be..  Maybe a satellite?  As I continued to ponder the that, I noticed it was flying towards my apartment building.  I was confused. It seemed to be flying lower now... And it was a grayish ship with a big white light and a tiny red one.  I remember it had a pointy cockpit looking thing? It was kind of in the  shape of a bird with a box for a body and without wings.  It had a long neck and then the head, which I thought was probably the cockpit.  I tried taking a video but my memory is full from all the spotify I download. &#128547&#128516 anyways, I was really sure what I was seeing and wanted to record information that I could review later.  So I tried taking pictures.  Nothing showed up. I saw for a total of about 10-15 minutes total.  I was staring at it when I thought it was a star, because all I could see was the bright light and it was low on the horizon near a bright star (from my perspective).  Then it moved I towards me and flew over my building. It kept going.  I tried calling my mom to run to the front of te apartment facing the way in which the ship flew but she was in the elevator at the time coming in from smoking a cigarette and was not able to see it. When I went to look out our bay window but nothing was flying. I believe in UFOs and believe they can connect us through astral projection(in which case a ship would be unnecessary), but I am a scientist at mind and need more evidence to validate my personal experience.  I hope others report seeing at around 5/15/15 1:20am.  It was a weird shape..  And it didn't make a sound.  The cars were louder so I doubt it could have been a plane and definitely not a helicopter, which given how low it was over the Park Blocks of downtown Portland would have more sense!  It was a UFO &#128529;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Strange object captured on camera but not to the naked eye;2015-10-10 18:46:00;?;Strange object captured on camera but not to the naked eye. I was just revising some sunset pictures that I took with my camera. When I downloaded the pictures tonight, I found this strange object on 2 of the photos only. These were taken last Oct. 10, 2015, and at 6:46 pm if the time was right on my camera, did not check.   I called my husband in to see if he also saw what I was seeing we were shocked.  I checked the dozen of photos I took several nights in a row and that night, only 2 photos had this stange sighting.  I have saved these photos if needed.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Possible rectangle with fire like lights silently gaining altitude from South East heading North West, possibly following jet.;2015-10-24 22:48:00;2 minutes;Possible rectangle with fire like lights silently gaining altitude from South East heading North West, possibly following jet. Standing in backyard taking the dog out.  An unknown object possibly rectangle in shape with three orange fire-like lights inside of it, the middle light the brightest, came diagonally from the south east.  Object was moving steadily and straight, about twenty feet above the tree line.  Object was silent but seemed very close for the first minute.  Object continued to the North West moving diagonally and swiftly gaining altitude for about another minute until breaking cloud cover near a recent jet trail and disappearing.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Strange moving multicolored diamond shape over Gresham, Oregon.;2015-12-04 23:30:00;2 minutes;Strange moving multicolored diamond shape over Gresham, Oregon. Was sitting with my husband in our backyard.  At first I thought it was an airplane flying towards the Portland airport.  I don’t have good vision.  I had my glasses on, but I'm near sighted, so all I saw at first was a large white light with small yellow and blue lights, and just thought it was an airplane. Then the little lights changed to yellow and purple, then back to blue and yellow a few times.  Then it took a 90 degree turn quite quickly and turned completely red while doing so.  At this point I thought maybe it was a drone or a military aircraft. My husband got up and turned around to look at this time.  There was no sound except sort of a high pitched pulsing sound.  My husband described it later as kind of like air moving? He heard it low pitched, I heard it high pitched.  Sort of like a “waow waow waow”.  We both kind of felt the sound too, like a wave. It kept moving on it’s new path, then took another 90 degree turn and suddenly sped up towards the horizon and disappeared over the roof of the house we were next to. It was sort of diamond or hexagon shaped with a flat bottom I think.  It was parallel to the horizon the whole time. It could very well has just been a drone someone was flying around, but whatever it was it was weird.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Dark grey box floating in the air near PDX airport.;2016-07-24 15:00:00;1 hour;Dark grey box floating in the air near PDX airport. Driving East on I-84, I observed a dark grey six sided box shaped object hovering in the sky at an altitude of perhaps 1000 ft.  The object was spotted a short distance North East of PDX international airport.   It had maybe a dozen ribs or reinforcements vertically on the side facing me.  The object appeared to be 150 feet long and perhaps thirty feet tall and thirty feet wide.  It remained stationary, perfectly still, as I drove by.   Then, it rotated 90 degrees so I could see it head on.  Viewed from the front, it made a perfect square in the sky.  I thought it was an airship but it had flat sides and distinct edges where the rectangle and square sides meet.  I saw no signs of windows or propellers or cables tethering it to the ground.  It had not changed position the whole time.   Eventually, I was too far away to see it.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Color shifting object moving east to west mid-morning.;2016-11-07 10:30:00;30-60 seconds;Color shifting object moving east to west mid-morning. Looking NNW a single object transited east to west across approximately 60 degrees of my point of view approximately 20 degrees above the horizon.  Conditions were mostly cloudy with periods of bright sunshine and blue skies, temperature around 62F. Object appeared below the cloud line, and changed color from white to reflective/metallic, to bright metallic red/orange, then back to reflective/metallic.  Seemingly more square shaped and moving at a high rate of speed.  Distance down range of my POV was difficult to determine as there was no point of reference.  There is an Air National Guard base at PDX, the flight path of this object would have crossed out-bound traffic from the base at 45 degrees from my POV.  There was no contrail or exhaust.  No sound could be heard but that could have been due to distance and that I was inside the house.  (Though airplanes can be heard from within the house.) I am near the out-bound flight path for the Air National Guard and in and out-bound traffic for PDX.  There are also a number of smaller regional airports within a 10 mile radius.  I have been observing the local skies for over 20 years.  I am not a trained observer.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Odd shaped object that rotated and got brighter and darker while moving across the sky.;2017-09-01 20:05:00;30 seconds;Odd shaped object that rotated and got brighter and darker while moving across the sky. I was in the lying in the backyard watching the stars come out.  About 20 minutes into it, I saw an object in the corner of my eye, and then put my full focus on it.  My wife was in the garage and I called out for her to come see it.  She only saw it for the last 10 seconds, or so. It made no noise and moved rather quickly.  It was gray in color but occasionally would light up and get brighter.  I'm not sure if this was reflected sunlight or what.  The shape was roughly cuboid or spherical and seemed to have bumps and parts that stuck out.  The object appeared to be rotating. I don't really know how far away it was other than the fact that it went behind a large tree that was about 30 feet away.  The apparent size was similar to my pinky nail with my arm outstretched. The path of the object was roughly NW to SE parallel to the Willamette River.  After it passed behind the large tree, we watched it get smaller and disappear towards the part of the sky where the moon was.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

At first thought was it was a spotlight in the area maybe?  But we are in an area that that doesn’t have nor have I seen any of those.

Multiple Star Like Phenomena  ((Starlink satellites??));2020-04-06 20:30:00;10 minutes;Multiple Star Like Phenomena While sitting in my backyard last night with my son, girlfriend and a family friend my son brought some interesting action going on in the skies.  He noticed some star like things that were coming up from the horizon, and then disappearing up into the night sky.  These were not satellites.  In fact we saw one fly from one end of the horizon to the other during this event.  The distance was completely unknown as they only appeared to be stars.  The behavior was this.  One object would rise up from the horizon.  It would go straight up vertical around the same speed as a satellite would move, but it would disappear.  Then another would come up from the horizon and do the same thing.  Go straight up vertical and disappear.  Some times there were two that were visible at the same time, but most of the time it was only one.  My son said he counted about 8 of them before he brought it to everybody else attention.  I personally witnessed, I'! m guestimating around 15-20 of these anomalies, maybe more.  We do a lot of sky watching.  Especially camping up around Mt. Adams.  We know the differences between an airplane (flashing lights, sound) from a satellite.  I have never seen a satellite behave in this manner.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
