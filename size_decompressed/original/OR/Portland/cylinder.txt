On july 26 1998,6:25PM(Sunday),in the backyard of my house,my brother observed a flying object in the sky.I went into the house immediately to get the videocamera. In about 25 sec.I came back with the videocamera and the binoculars.When we first saw the object at (90 degrees), it was round  like a ball,and the color was white.My brother looked through the binoculars(20*50) and saw the object a little bigger but the shape did not change too much.When I started videotapping,the object was at 45 degrees flying SE,I zoomed in 72 times with a 8 mm videocamera and the object looked totaly different.It looked like a cylinder,the front and the back were black and the midlle was white like a neon light.The light seemed to be comming from inside of the object.There was no sound at all.The object was probably flying 3000 miles per hour.I videotaped the object for 30 sec. and then  it disappeared in the clouds.The  witnesses were: Me,my wife,my doughter,my brother and his wife.I attach 2 photos of the object.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
I saw a cylindrical object hovering and moving in a square pattern and then it sped away at a great rate of speed.;2000-07-12 18:30:00;30-45 seconds;I saw a cylindrical object hovering and moving in a square pattern and then it sped away at a great rate of speed. At approximately 6:30 pm, Wed July 12th, 2000 my fiance and I wereon the back porch enjoying the warm evening. As I looked SE I noticed a cylindrical shape hovering in the sky. I was looking between two trees approx. 20 ft apart. The object was grey or brown in color and would shimmer or reflect bright light on the top. I seemed to be appoximately 1 - 2 miles away. I couldn't really judge the distance due to the fact that I did not know what I could compare it to to judge the size, then the distance. It hovered, but not completely still. It seemed to move up and then to one side or another then down and to the other side - an almost square pattern. It then moved in an easterly direction. I had to move to my right to keep an eye on it. It then picked up speed...a lot of speed. It moved very fast to the east, past the tree that was in my line of site, and then almost straight up into the cloud cover. Approximately 30 seconds later, a small jet, (possibly a LearJet?) crossed the sky at approximately the same line as my sight was for the object. My fiance was with me, but when I finally realized what I was looking at, I asked her to look in the same direction, between the two trees. She said she could not see what I was pointing at. It was at that time the object moved to the east and then up.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

The shadow moved as fast as the air plane,I asked my fiance if she had seen it, she replied yes, I asked her what it was, she said i dont know.  it was there for about 10 seconds then it disapeared. vanished. like in a movie, of like startrack or something. it looked as though it was black molicules disapearing. it was perfectly shaped it was not like smoke. but it looked like black smoke would. except it was a long cylinder shape. i,ve never seen any thing like it , i just want to know why it was there for us to see. the driver (my best friend) never saw it, but he might have missed it. any facts or questions would be greatly appreciative.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
gold cylindrical object with red top and bottom. Tumbles head over head at high altitiude.;2008-09-10 14:00:00;15 min;gold cylindrical object with red top and bottom. Tumbles head over head at high altitiude. I went over to my friend's house with my daughter and saw that he was scanning the skies with a pair of binoculars. I joked around about him seeing things up there, to which he calmly replied, yeah there is one up there right now. I took the binoculars and aimed it in the direction he pointed. At first I saw nothing but a high altitude plane, at about 35,000 ft. but then to my surprise I saw something else too. Beyond the plane, higher up, maybe at 60,000 ft. I saw something strange. I put down the lens and looked again with the naked eye, nothing. Again, I looked through the binocs and once again saw the thing in the bright day sky. It looked like a gold cylinder with reddish top and bottom. My brain could not quite place the object, I was searching for a connection to something else I may have seen before but could not quite understand what it was that I was looking at.The only connection I could fathom was that I looked kind of like a plane rising up into the sky at first, then, it also had characteristics of a kite, but it was tumbling, head over head, in one place. I was confused and amazed, I really could not place this thing...I could not understand in my mind what this was....strange. My friend then told of how he had been seeing these things all week and followed them with the binocs as they moved, often randomly, his girlfriend also witnessed them from time to time yet she never spoke of it and even joked around about her crazy boyfriend always looking up. I am not saying there where little green men in these objects but to this day I can not explain or identify this object with any one thing I have ever seen before. I am a skeptic person by my nature, an atheist. I teach sculpture for a living an am pretty good at identifying objects and forms of all types but this flat out baffled me.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Bright white cylinder, or sphere, makes rapid descent & disappears.;2014-09-05 23:12:00;5 seconds;Bright white cylinder, or sphere, makes rapid descent & disappears. Iridescent bright white (lit up with a squid like external appearance - no tentacles..just the body portion) cylinder type object fell from the sky at a rapid speed. It appeared out of nowhere and made its decent in a manner of seconds.  It appeared to disappear before reaching ground.  My location is SE Portland and I was viewing the sky in the northern direction. I do live nearby the PDX airport. That fact has absolutely no bearing on what was seen.  Due to traffic noise, unable to determine if it did have any type of sound to it. Perhaps, due to the speed it came down, it could have been a sphere rather than cylinder.  The lighting of the object may have just made it appear to be a different shape by causing a light trail behind it. It was not a lantern, falling star or meteorite.  I don't know what it was ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
star/ white cylinder object seen by students at school.;2017-01-27 13:15:00;15 minutes;star/ white cylinder object seen by students at school I am a school teacher.  My class and I were outside doing a couple laps on the school track after lunch.  The sky was clear and a couple planes were going by.  I glanced up and was looking at the long trail produced out the back of one of the planes, when I noticed what looked like a very bright star in the east by southeast portion of the sky.  It appeared to be above the 33,000 foot cruising altitude and was slightly bigger than the planes which were flying their typical daily routes.  It just stayed in one place.  I pointed it out to my kids because we had never seen  a stationary star in the daylight before.  The rest of my class gathered around us and we all stopped and watched it.  It seemed to slowly shift and elongate.  In other words--it went from a star to a white cylinder shape, and then back to a star as if it was maybe rotating like a baton.  It would remain a star and only occasionally switch to the cylinder only a few times (3x).  A couple times it completely disappeared, then would reappear in the same place.  It moved very slowly to the center of the sky at a barely legible speed over the course of 15 minutes, and then completely disappeared.  My class was excited and freaking out to each other.  None of them were scared whatsoever, and in fact seemed very elated.  There was no noise detected from the object, although we cannot hear jets at that altitude either.. ((NUFORC Note:  We have viewed the video, and the white light looks to us to be Venus.  PD)) ((;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
