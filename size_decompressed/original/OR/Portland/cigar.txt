The cigar shaped crafts unusual attitude is something I have never seen repeated with any modern aircraft past or present.;1969-10-15 13:00:00;3-1/2;The cigar shaped crafts unusual attitude is something I have never seen repeated with any modern aircraft past or Age at time of sighting: Age 12   Location: Portland, Oregon   Viewpoint: SE 53rd Street between Burnside and Stark St.  Location of object or perceived location: Over Portland West hills, at a starting altitude estimated at 4000 AGL moving at a 45-degree angle (from the horizon). Movement appeared to be from South to North at a speed I would now estimate at no more than 55 knots. I calculate the speed by using other more common references such as identifiable aircraft I have seen in the same vicinity on other days. The object I observed and the object / crafts unusual attitude is something I have never seen repeated with any modern aircraft past or present.  Description of object: Cigar shaped (ends pointed), dimensional measurements estimated as follows – Length 250’, 30’ girth, color a dark gray, almost black.  Detail of sighting: On the day of the UFO sighting, 3 friends and I where playing football in my parent’s backyard, I was the first to notice the object. My friends where more interested in playing football rather then studying the anomaly which I alerted them all to … I can remember one of my friends stating after looking at the object that it must be an aircraft banking and thus no visible empennage or wings. I continued to watch more intently after the friend’s suggestion and waiting for what seemed to be about 2 minuets as to view the craft turn and expose some identifiable surface. However I did not notice any change in the flight path of the object nor view any recognizable aircraft surfaces. In fact the angel of the object and its assent seemed so unusual I thought perhaps the object was a blimp, but I concluded that was not logical seeing its shape, speed, lack of identifiable markings, attitude and size. After about a total of 3-1/2 minutes I turned to my friends again to explain to them my thoughts and when I turned back the object was gone. The last point I saw the object put it in the clear of clouds and its disappearance in just an instant still amazes me even today.

Cigar shaped object over Porland Oregon 8/76;1976-08-30 02:00:00;3-4 minutes;Cigar shaped object over Porland Oregon 8/76 My sighting was in Portland Oregon in August of 1976.  Early in the morning I was returning from work when in the western sky I saw an eliongated or cigar shaped object that appeared to be slowly moving from west to east, the object came to a complete stop several times and then it would move very quickly at acute angles and then after 3-4 minutes it just disappeared. It was quite high in the sky and compared to the moon it was approximately 1/20 of its size and had some type of illumination but not like a planes running lights, more of a greenish glow.  I have never shared this with anyone before and after hearing you on C2C the other night I felt the need to document my experience.

It was a long cigar shaped object no way its some thing we built.;1991-09-15 14:30:00;1 minutes;It was a long cigar shaped object no way its some thing we built. I can't live with this anymore.  I'm a electrician and was at work it was partly cloudy day.  I just came out of the outside toilet when I looked up and saw a shaped object just floating in sky.  I'm thinking 1 mile away it made no sound had no lights on looked like brushed aluminum.   It had no exhaust trail or rotors.  It stood there then clouds came in front of it passed and was gone.  There was a nuclear power plant 50 miles away.  I thought I was seeing things until I talked to another electrician on a different job he saw it closer and was scared to talk about it.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Sky was clear with the exception of a few clouds. A large silver/white cigar shaped craft moved from behind one of the clouds. No sound;1999-06-18 14:00:00;5 mins.;Sky was clear with the exception of a few clouds. A large silver/white cigar shaped craft moved from behind one of the clouds. No sound, no wings, no tail, no contrail, nothing hanging down bottom of craft. I was sitting on my porch looking up at the sky. The sky was clear and sunny with the exception of a few clouds. As I was looking at one of the clouds a craft moved slowly from behind it. My first thought was 'What the heck is that?' It was a large white/silvery color and rather radiated very bright white reflextion/light. I did not see wings, a tail, anything hanging from the bottom of the craft, no blinking lights. The craft left no contrail and made no sound. It was cigar shaped and about the size of three Goodyear Blimps end to end. I watched it move across the sky at a steady rate of speed until I could no longer see it because of trees in the next door neighbor's yard. I am a graghic artist and know how to 'look' at an object. I have never seen anything like this before. Two weeks later my roommate and I were out in the back yard working in the folwer bed and I sat down to rest...looked up and saw another craft just like the one I reported above only smaller in size. I called to my roommate and pointed to the craft. We both watched it travel across the sky. Both craft came from the same direction.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Cigar shaped object,  reflective silver/white in color seen moving silently through the sky.;1999-07-10 18:00:00;5 minutes;Cigar shaped object,  reflective silver/white in color seen moving silently through the sky. The craft was observed by myself, a Psychiatric/Mental Health nurse and my friend, a Computer Digital Imager. I am 48 yrs. old, and my friend is 51. We were in the yard working in the garden. My friend saw the object first and called my attention to it. The day had been warm and sunny, with no clouds. There had been some air traffic earlier, just a couple of small planes. The air space above our home is not in the flight path of the local airport. We were not able to determine distance of the craft.  It was moving slower than a passenger jet, but faster than a small plane. We were both struck by the fact that the crat was completely silent, had no wings, no tail fin, no contrail. Atmospheric displacement noted extending around craft, rather sphere like in shape. The sky was clear, no clouds.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
objects seen while waiting on city buses;2000-06-21 15:30:00;10-20 seconds;objects seen while waiting on city buses At approximately 3:30 p.m. I seen and photographed a cigar shaped craft at a high altitude.  I was standing on the corner of W. Burnside Street and N.W. 5th ave waiting on a city bus.  This craft emited light (but it could have been from the sunlight reflecting off the object).  It was not (in my opinion) a regular airplane because there was no wings.  I seen this craft cruising around 5 m.p.h. seemingly because of its altitude.  I grabbed my camera and managed to take three pictures of it before it vanished.  This craft was flying in a straight south to north direction The second craft was see while again waiting for a city bus at the corner of S.W. 5th ave and S.W. Washington Street.  This object was much closer to the ground and appeared to be cruising at about 5 m.p.h. also, this craft had no wings.  I could see more detail but was not able to tell that much about it because I was not wearing my glasses at the time.  This craft appeared at around 3:52 p.m. and both objects were seen over Downtown Portland.  I was not able to get pictures of this craft because I was viewing it between buildings as it was flying.  Both objects did not emit sound.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
The objects I saw were beyond our atmosphere.  The size of the cigar object had to be huge for me to see it at that distance.;2002-06-25 10:20:00;10min;The objects I saw were beyond our atmosphere.  The size of the cigar object had to be huge for me to see it at that distance. I observed a silver ball traveling from the  North to Southwest on a clear bright sunny morning.I watch this object moving what appeared to be slow going in a straight line. And somewhat out there at a distance. Because normal aircraft was traveling well below this small silver ball.  A military jet pasted threw this area and well below with a vapor trail.  Has I continued to watch,  then I saw IT.  In the background and way further out was a cigar shaped object,  following the silver ball. This second object was dark in color as it appeared against the bright blue morning sky.  Then the small silver ball suddenly stopped. Seconds passed.  I watched and waited.  Then the silver ball began to move.  Not backwards nor in a continueous direction had it was previously.  But was heading towards the mother ship. I continued to watch till the silver ball I lost sight of. And also the larger object.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Black dash near moon around 6 pm on the 4th of july in Se Portland near Mt. Tabor.;2006-07-04 18:00:00;5-7 seconds;Black dash near moon around 6 pm on the 4th of july in Se Portland near Mt. Tabor. We were cooking on our patio near Mt. Tabor in SE Portland when I casualy looked up at the moon and saw what looked like a black dash/line/hyphen just below and to the right of the moon. I looked like it was very high in the air. It was still daylight and it was not any sort of firework. It was perfectly still for about 4 second and then turned white and sped off to the right and downward very fast and out of site beyond the tree line.
