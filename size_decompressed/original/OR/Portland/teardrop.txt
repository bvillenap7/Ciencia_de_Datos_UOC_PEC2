highly-reflective inverted black teardrop over a Portland evening;2005-07-15 20:30:00;15 seconds;highly-reflective inverted black teardrop over a Portland evening I had just finished my shift at the bakery and stepped outside to wait for a friend. The sun was beginning to set though the sky was still blue. With a few minutes to wait I looked up and something caught my eye. At first, due to the shape of this object (a black inverted teardrop) I believed it was a black balloon that had been let go, but once I saw that it was moving in a perfectly straight line I began to wonder (if it was a balloon, I figured, it would have had at least a slight variation in attitude or bearing). I was facing north when I first saw it, with the sun setting to the west, and it was travelling approx. East-Southeast. As I turned towards the east to follow it, I saw the sunlight reflecting off it's west side and realized it was a highly reflective surface in the shape of a perfectly inverted teardrop. Although I couldn't tell for sure, I received the impression it was spinning at a very high velocity. There was no sound beside those of the city, though I was in a state of sensation during the event. The sighting lasted about 15 seconds over residential Portland.

Firey light, orb flashing red, retro rocket flying backwards.;2013-05-05 23:20:00;1+ hr;Firey light, orb flashing red, retro rocket flying backwards. I was looking straight up looking for meteors. as I looked down towards the southern horizon I saw a wood fire colored light approaching at a low altitude and slow speed. it then turned at a right angle to the west and changed to a red object in the shape of a teardrop or like a afterburner flying backwards and red, quickly changing size to a flashing speck, then vanished.  Reappeared seconds later, appearing to be a great distance away. faint blinking / changing to solid white/erratic.  moving up then down, movement almost fluid, like a bag in the wind. no possible way man made not a toy, not humanly technologically possible.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Blue/white light streaks across western horzion.;2013-06-01 20:45:00;10 minutes;Blue/white light streaks across western horzion While driving north down 102nd we noticed a bright light streaking from the south heading north on the western horizon.  It was bright with blue hue in it and with a long tail (blue white) and was brighter than the sunset.  We surmised that it must have been a comet, but later looked for any evident of any comet reports within the area and there was none.  We watched it for another 5-8 minutes as it disappeared to the north.  We didnâ€™t think to video it until the last 15 seconds which only shows a small white light disappearing off to the north.   We watched all news cast, online reports, and any pre-comet/asteroid events to no avail.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Large floating UFO near Portland, Oregon airport as seen from plane.;2014-06-01 19:30:00;5 seconds;Large floating UFO near Portland, Oregon airport as seen from plane At approximately 19:30, I was on a flight as it approached Portland International Airport.  I was seated in a window seat approx. 6 rows in front of the wing at that time.  Around 15 minutes prior to landing (NE approach), I noticed an unidentified object in the sky, while viewing the landscape below.  We were still several thousand feet off the ground (houses were approx. 5mm in size) at this time.  The object appeared to be stationary and approximately 1000 feet below us and to the left of the plane.  It consisted of a cluster of round metallic objects making up the top half of the craft, which via a circular midsection joined an elongated four sided pyramid as the bottom half.  All areas of the craft were silver and reflective in nature.  The top half can best be described as if you created a larger sphere out of adjoining smaller spheres.  This top half was not elongated or billowing in the wind as a weather ballon might do. I observed the object for approx. 5 seconds, as my plane passed by.  My view of the object was excellent.  There were no clouds in the sky, and I could see multiple details of the craft.  I did not note any vapors or heat waves emanating from the craft.  After we left the craft behind, I began scanning objects on the ground to reference the crafts size.  My best guess is comparing it to a semi truck while we were 600 ft above it. Others may have seen this craft but no one said anything on the flight.  Unfortunately we passed by too quick to take a picture, but I am 100% certain of what I saw.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Fireball.;2016-07-14 21:30:00;4 seconds;Fireball. Saw a teardrop shaped light with a blue green leading edge the big circular part, the body was bright white, appearing like a flag, waving, same visual effect, tapering to a point, where it was red. I'd was definetly losing altitude, it went behind some trees...  Blocking my view, I waited for a BOOM but nothing..  Between a quarter and a nickel sized image if the coin was held at arms length;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
