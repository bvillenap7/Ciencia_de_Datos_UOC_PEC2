Huge UFO passing between opening over the city of Portland, Oregon;1999-01-24 20:00:00;120 seconds;Huge UFO passing between opening over the city of Portland, Oregon Coming down OHSU Hospital in Portland, Oregon which is on a hill above the city.  It was winter and the sky was clouded and grey, but there was like an opening between the clouds and below it you could see the city lights.  It was about 8 PM on a Sunday night.  As I was going down the hill, looking at the city, suddenly a huge, immense, flying object started passing almost in front of me, and on top of the city.  I stop the car in the middle of the road as I couldn't believe what I was seeing.  It was flying low, so low I could see how huge it was.  Unbelievable... it was almost at the bottom of the heavy clouds passing the opening in the sky.  I could see it passing, like in slow motion, like almost hoovering, without making any noise, nothing.  It was in a tilt position, like a dish, a plate... Huge, immense,like a football field,looked round but it was so big it could have been oval because the border of the tilt make me feel it was round or oval, looked heavy, the color was clear grey metalic but it was not shiny, on the tilted side I could see, there where four roads of blinking lights, like the christmas lights. I didn't see the top because it was tilted, only the bottom and the lights around the side. After being in my car looking at this scenario, I decided to walk outside the vehicle, to see if someone else was seeing it. But when I stepped out and looked at the sky, the flying object had dissapeared. I returned to the hospital as I was so impressed... I told my story to the ER doctors I work with and everyone believe me.  I was told they see things like that all the time.  For me was the first and the last.  I called the Air Force, the TV stations, the airport, but no one give me any attention.  I do believe that I saw a UFO, I think I was fortunate to see something like that in my life.  It was too wide and too long, and absolutely quiet to be anything I have ever seen.  It was not an airplane or a flying globe.  This was a huge, immense object, so big, it couldn't be confused with any known thing.  May be a mother ship? I will never forget this experience, I could take a test to verify my story.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

I was lying in bed trying to sleep. I looked out my second story window at the sky, from the right side of my window, I saw an oval, lighted (brightly lit, almost glowing, too small, oval and bright to have been a search light that I often saw in the sky at night) object moving at a steady medium paced speed across the sky from right to left looking out my window. I sat up and followed it with my eyes amazed at what I was seeing. It disapeared from my eye sight. If I would have gotten out of bed and walked to the right of my room I would have been able to watch it further, but I was much too freaked out!;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

Then there were two more black helicopters  a distance away from it. Where the Police helicopter was they made a pryamid shape formation. off to the distance I saw this silver sort of oval round thing flying at a steady speed. It went into a little cloud and didn't come out the otherside!!!!! Then from the west coming in an eastern direction was a black jet. I could even  hear it. The silver object I saw was about the size of a bic pen cap if I were to hold it at arms legth. Very weird. My heart is still racing.

It was pretty warm that day and it was not subsiding, so my grandmother opened up the front door so it would cool off in the house. The door had been open for a little bit while I watched T.V. so I didn’t pay much attention to it until I was getting the urge to look outside. So I turned around in my chair and looked outside, at first I didn’t see anything well, different, then I looked upward and I saw what I thought was a plane (there so frequent). Then after a few seconds I realized, it was just staying right in that one spot. I was so drawn to this object it was bizarre. The object started to move after about 30 seconds of just chilling in one spot, it shot left to right a few time at speeds I had never seen before. Then the object was doing circles and weird jolting patterns, it then stopped dead in the middle, shot back (well got smaller so I assumed it was going back from where I was.), shot down, shot back again, shot up a little ways, stayed there, then shot up and I have never seen anything like it again.

I Saw 4 oval shaped objects in the sky to the north of my house;2002-09-11 22:00:00;10-15 sec.;I Saw 4 oval shaped objects in the sky to the north of my house Sept. 11 2002 between 10:00 and 11:00 Pacific time I saw, in the sky north of my bedroom window above the trees in my backyard, four objects of apparently oval shape(Although I suppose they could have merely been at an angle at which they seemed oval shaped, but I digress.)They moved in an eastern direction swirling around each other in a counter clockwise direction. They moved soundlessly as far as I could tell, passed behind a fig tree in my backyard, and I did not see them reemerge from behoind the tree. They were colored a sort of greyish color that was about the color that most clouds appear at night, but these were moving far faster and in a different manner than any cloud that I have ever seen. There were no lights that I saw just a solid looking grey color on the ovals. I have lived close to an airport almost all of my life and have a passing familiarity with what planes look and sound like at night. I can't remember seeing a plane at night that close to an airport with no obvious lights anywhere on it let alone four. They were planes taking off and coming into the airport not too long before or after my sighting. This sighting took place over the course of no more than 15 or so seconds. This may sound strange but the shapes seemed to be almost two dimensional, but that is merely a personal opinion.(And I don't mean I think they came from the 2nd demension I mean they seemed to posess no depth.) ((NUFORC Note:  We observe that the description provided by the witness is not inconsistent with a sighting of laser-based advertising lights.  However, that is a guess.

Three amber/orange objects patrol Portland skyline;2005-05-01 01:00:00;3-7 minutes;Three amber/orange objects patrol Portland skyline My friends and I were on our balcony overlooking downtown portland when one of our friends noticed three bright orange lights flying over the skyline. It was a very clear night and we could clearly see that the objects were flying in a line formation, flying South.  There was an airplane flying in this area at this time as well, and we could see using this as a reference point that the other three objects were much larger than the airplane. They were flying at a patrol-like speed and relatively low. Our balcony faces north with the skyline to the east.  Once the objects flew behind our building where we couldn't see them anymore, we ran downstairs to see them. I got there in time to them disappear as they flew farther and farther out into space.  My friends who had gotten downstairs first, said that the three objects formed a triangle before flying farther out until they disappeared. I noticed as they were disappearing that one of the objects was larger than the other two. The objects appeared to be oval shaped, but because the lights were so bright it is hard to be sure.  Whatever they were, they were in clear sight and flying low, they didn't seem to mind if they were seen.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

It was aprox. 30-50 feet diameter, from side to side, by my estimate to the downtown Burnside bridge area it was hovering over. It was a single object, and it did not move while I observed it except for a slight unjulation which gave it the imperfect circular shape that I just mentioned. My astute girlfriend also observed this strange object, at the same instance as myself, as well as earlier that morning, by herself, around 10:30 A.M . This is certainly not the first UFO that I have seen here in my 1 year in Portland, Oregon. I have seen 1 black triangle near the Mall 205 exit off of the 205 freeway, as well as several other pasty light ball objects hovering over downtown Portland in clear blue mid day last fall, October 2005, 1 orange/metalic orb august 2005, and 1 diamond shaped black, brown, and grey object weaving eratically in and out of the clouds and then zipping off, early april 2006! Well, that's more than enough for now, but yes, Portland is a HOT SPOT for UFOs as far as I can tell!  S.E.

On July 12, 2008 at 22:20 my wife our son, nephew and myself witnessed an oval shaped object in the night sky. When we first sighted the object it was heading in a Northwesterly direction crossing in front of the Big Dipper. While we watched the object, it intensified in brightness continuing in its path for about the distance from the bottom of the dipper ladle to the middle top of the ladle. About an inch in the night sky past the ladle of the dipper the object made an abrupt 90 degree turn and shot out of the Earths orbit. Approximately 10 second later an airplane “this one we new by the flashing beacon lights” flew across the night sky at about 35,000 feet but it continued on its path like it was going to Seattle Washington. I can’t tell you if the plane was following it but I don’t know how he could have not seen it because it was so bright.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
9 Objects, oval in shape;2011-09-09 20:00:00;5 Minutes;9 Objects, oval in shape Hi, Just thought I would let you know. On Friday, September 9th, at approx 8:00 pm, my seven year old son and I were driving back to Portland,Oregon from Vancouver,Wa. When we were coming off I5 on to the 405 he said Dad what are those?. I looked over downtown and there were seven objects, fairly large.  There was another off in the distance, much larger over the hill. I told him they were probably planes or helicopters. He then said look there is another down by the river.  I looked down towards the St Johns bridge and there was one down there as well.  They all had a light in the middle and a blue and white light rotating around the circumference. I say circumference because we drove right under one on the 405 and it was approx 500 to 1000 feet up.  It was round, and large.  Other people were looking because I looked at the car next to us and they were looking up also. My son said Dad we need to call Rxxx Lxxxxxxx and Gxxxxx Nxxxx. LOL Any way, we came home and told my wife and then I started to look on YouTube to see if anyone saw what we did, there was one video a few hours later.  I continued to look on YouTube every few days.  Just the other day I found a new video on YouTube and I think it is what we saw. The video is apparently older, but it is taken from he St Johns bridge and looks very similar to what we saw. The video was taken during the day, we saw ours right at dusk. But they are similar. Any how, just thought you might be interested.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

Late on Sunday night, I was laying in my room, when I heard an extremely loud high pitched noise and a buzzing noise.  I walked up to the window and opened the curtains.

Color changing, silent, slow moving oval above Portland's West Hills.;2017-04-03 00:30:00;<1 minute;Color changing, silent, slow moving oval above Portland's West Hills. I woke up because my cat was meowing at the window. I told her to be quiet, but she just kept on meowing, so I opened my eyes. I looked out of my window to see what the cat was meowing at thinking it must be a box elder bug on the glass or something, but instead I saw a big green oval of light. I live in a high rise building and can see Council Crest and the eastern side of West Hills from my apartment.  I can make out the houses and features of this part of West Hills well.  I could see a big green oval of light in the sky.  It seemed to be moving slower than a plane or helicopter, and seemed to be silent.  I put on my glasses so I could see it better out of curiosity and when I realized it wasn’t a plane or helicopter, I ran out of bed over to the window to get a better look. I saw the oval move towards West Hills.  Then it slowly went over the hill and then I couldn’t see it anymore.  The whole time it was floating around, it was gradually changing color from green to orange-red and back to green, with the color change seemingly starting towards the bottom right of the oval, and then sweeping over the rest of the oval until the thing had mostly turned orange-red. I don't know if the oval was solid or just light, but it seemed to have very clearly defined edges.  It was not like spot lights at all, which kind of have fuzzy, soft edges. I know the oval was not a plane because planes are not oval shaped and they move faster.  I see planes all the time from my windows, sometimes even antique ones, but this was not plane shaped and did not make any sound like a plane.  I know the green oval was not a helicopter because I see helicopters a lot, too, and they are noisy and I can clearly make out the helicopter shape.  In fact, I saw a helicopter come from the SW part of Portland towards the center of Portland a few minutes after I saw the green oval. I know this wasn’t a car on the streets of West Hills because I could clearly see the oval in the middle of the sky at first.  And I don’t think it was a drone because it looked to be wider than the houses it was above in West Hills when it was above them.  I thought for a second that it might be the aerial tram, which I can see a little bit from my place, but the aerial tram doesn’t change colors, it is not green and it doesn’t float around in the middle of the sky, obviously.  I don’t even think that tram runs at 12:30AM. I know the oval wasn’t making noise because I can clearly hear planes and helicopters from my apartment.  Also, even though this green oval floated really close to the houses on West Hills, nobody’s lights went on like they heard a loud noise above their house.  I had my window cracked and could hear the helicopter a few minutes later, so I know that the noise would have definitely have come through if there were any. I tried to take a picture of the oval but my hands were shaking and I kept dropping my phone because I was a little nervous about the green thing in the sky, not knowing what is was and all, and I was trying to make my cat stop meowing by petting her at the same time.  By the time I got my phone camera ready, the thing had floated over the West Hills and out of my sight.  I don’t know what the green oval thing was, so I am hoping maybe someone else does and can tell me.  I could draw a picture of it if that would help identify it.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
