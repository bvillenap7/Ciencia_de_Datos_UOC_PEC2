Dark Cylinder/ Rectangular flying object dips in and out of low clouds over Portland, Oregon;2004-05-15 14:30:00;10 minutes;Dark Cylinder/ Rectangular flying object dips in and out of low clouds over Portland, Oregon Personal Testament of Experience on 5/15/04 in Portland, Oregon Last Saturday, my next door neighbor and I went on a bike ride down the east side bike path in Portland.  We stopped by a friend’s work during her lunch break and then continued on our bike ride down towards the Steel Bridge.  We went under the Burnside Bridge on the bike/walk dock and neighbor stopped suddenly on her bike in front of me.  I thought that something was wrong with her bike at first because she stopped so abruptly.  I came to a stop behind her and looked up to where she was looking.  We both saw what seemed to be a huge metallic pipe floating in the sky.  The sky was covered with very low clouds and scattered light showers.  The pipe was moving slowly from the north in and out of the clouds and then began moving south parallel with I-5, but more so above the east side of Portland. During the bike ride I was in the process of photographing Portland’s bridges for my grandfather who is a retired civil engineer.  I remembered that I had my digital camera with and scrambled to pull it out of my bike bag.  I began to photograph the object in the sky (between 2:00 pm and 2:30 pm on 5/ 15/ 04).  Once I started taking pictures the object leveled out, flattened, and moved slowly towards us.  I took the picture and looked around to see if anyone else noticed this thing.  I was surprised when I realized that virtually no one else was out on the dock that afternoon.  There was one runner, a woman that glanced up and over her shoulder when she ran by to see what we were staring at.  She did not stop to look and I doubt that she saw the object from the angle at which she turned her head.  We did not say anything to the runner because we were completely stunned by what we thought we were experiencing.  The object remained flat and continued to hover above us.  I took a couple more pictures and then I got a really weird feeling that I should not be taking these photos.  I put my camera down out of respect for the object (I don’t know why).  Neighbor and I just stared at the pipe/ or disk (looked more like a pipe-disk the closer it came because I could see a slight bend at each corner).  I can not tell if it was my eyes playing tricks on me or the pipe emanating energy towards us.  It looked like a shifting aura or something that was pulsing towards us.  Something like a light or small sun beams that break through clouds, but it was not very bright and rather bluish-white-grayish. I then decided to us my video mode on digital camera because I knew my other friend would not believe what I had seen if I did not have moving footage.  Unfortunately I cannot zoom in on video mode like I am able to with still shots, but I worked with what I had.  I began to film the object and it began to move away from us heading east.  I filmed the I-5 and then back to the sky to put the event in perspective.  The object continued to move away and then turned slightly to the left/ north.  It began to move further away and I stopped filming because I was frightened.  When the object was close I was not scared but more so in awe of the event, however, when the object moved away I began to panic because I felt I had seen something I should not have (don’t know why again).  I felt that the object was still watching us even though now behind the clouds. I also felt that the object could hear us or knew what we were thinking.  I then turned to neighbor and made her promise that we would not tell anyone, out of respect towards whatever that was.  We expressly agreed with a hand shake (in my head I figured that they needed to see this) and got back on our bikes and headed north towards the steel bridge slowly.  We could still see the object but I just wanted to get out there.  The object dipped back down out of the clouds and then went up and slightly towards to north out of sight. While we were riding away I checked to see if neighbor was all right.  I felt funky through my entire body and pretty confused (not to the point of disorientation though).  She asked me why I wanted to know if she was all right, I did not answer her and continued to ride across the bridge.  We barely said a word to each other for the rest of the ride, only a “what the hell was that” every now and then.  When I got home I put the pictures in my computer and I was surprised to see that the camera picked up the object on video.  I showed neighbor and we really didn’t talk about it much until later that night after we had a couple beers.  We totally broke our earlier agreement because the excitement of what had happened earlier hit us after a few beers.  We decided to show the photos only to people that we thought could appreciate them.  The more we showed the photos, the more we wanted to continue to show the photos.  Many of our friends say that they got chills when they viewed the pictures on my computer.  It really was exciting for everyone and I am glad to a certain extent that we broke the agreement to not tell anyone. I have not contacted this web page sooner than today because I am fearful of the ramifications.  I am fearful of the secrecies within government and I am ignorant to whatever it was that was looking back at us on the dock.  I hope that by sharing this story and pictures with everyone will help in some way.  I don’t know how it will help but I know that it was one of the most amazing things I have seen occur in the sky.  The next day I went to the ocean for a friend’s birthday and took a picture of my first whale.  This little camera is the best investment I have made this year.  Thanks for listening, there are few more post sighting experiences that I have not included because I do not know if they are relevant…I don’t even know what I experienced.  I would like to talk with someone in person before I share any of that.  All we have is a moment;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Faint transparent rectangle with red & green southwest of Portland, Oregon.;2006-04-25 23:20:00;4 seconds;Faint transparent rectangle with red & green southwest of Portland, Oregon. I wasn't going to report this but since I see from this site's homepage that there have been others sightings in my area, I tought that I should relate my experience before all the others details are posted.  I live in a community southwest of Portland, Oregon.  While I was outside looking at the night sky my attention was drawn to an object just NE of my zenith near the head of Ursa Major.  The object was very faint, nearly transparent but certainly had some form.  It was difficuly for me to judge it's size but I estimate that it was approximately 1 degree of arc.  It's shape was either rectangular or oval.  The object being very faint, it was my impression that it was purposely difficult to see.  Without it's movement, I may not have seen it at all.  But once locked on  I was able to follow it.  The object was mostly black either because it was transparent against the dark sky or made of a dark material.  I'm not sure which.  But it did have a very subtle green and red glow.  The object moved in a straight line from Ursa Major due east past the guardians made a quick jog to the north and resumed an easterly course.  I lost it soon after this course correction in the murkiness of the city lights and did not see it again.  I estimate that the object covered about 50 degrees of sky in about the 4 seconds that I tracked it in front of me.  It made no sound.  I can't really explain what I saw.  I googled ufo reporting in hopes of finding something out and was pleased to see that the Portland area was at the top of your site although my event was a few nights earlier.   I hope this information helps and I'll be checking back to see if any conclusions are made.  I'd love to know what the heck it was.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Orange glowing, black center wing;2011-09-20 01:55:00;6 seconds;Orange glowing, black center wing Orange glow perimeter, center being black or translucent.  It was not a rectangle but was like a wing with no tail or nose.  Like a butterfly wing shape but without the 3rd & 4th wing   This appeared so fast.  It glided, but at an incredidble speed. It travelled straight across sky.  At the height i am guessing at would be towards upper atomosphere or satelite orbit height.  Size wise is hard.  From that distance it would have to be huge!  Satelites are dots, this had shape.  I would have to say that take mars in the night sky and place 8 to 10 side by side to roughly get its size for that distance.  But when you see satelite dots orbit the earth its self explainatory.  This shot straight across for 6 seconds which came from around the moon area flew over my head (area) and lost it in the clouds that were forming.  Having given guessed altitude, i could be wrong or right?  I did not pay enough attention to height.  It was silent so i figured it was higher than normal planes would fly.  Most amazing thing i have ever seen.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
4 red pulsing lights fly over Portland.;2013-05-13 22:00:00;6 minutes;4 red pulsing lights fly over Portland My friend and I left an apartment in downtown Portland near Jeld Wen Field to walk back to his apartment on SW 14th Ave.   When we got to the apartment, from the parking lot we saw a red pulsing light appear from over the west hills moving southeast.   This craft was followed by another craft that looked the same.  They flew slightly faster than an airplane and at a lower altitude.   When these two flew out of sight, another red light appeared from over the west hills followed by another one at the same distance as the first two flying in a similar direction although slightly lower in altitude and more south in their direction but still flying southeast.   There seemed to be a low sound but it was hard to hear because we were standing right near the 405 freeway in between Salmon and Taylor St.  It was difficult to tell how large the objects were but they seemed to be around the size of a small plane.  They were bright red and seemed to pulse at a rate close to human heart beat so the light was emitted constantly.   There were planes in the sky at the time but much higher in altitude with small blinking red and white lights and on a different path.  I have never seen planes in the sky travelling on the same path as these 4 red lights.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

Bright red color, flow of the light, distinct shadows, height in the sky, no sounds;2020-07-25 22:00:00;10 seconds;Bright red color, flow of the light, distinct shadows, height in the sky, no sounds I was having a cigarette on my front porch and all of the sudden I saw a very distinct red flowing light from it’s left to right a very bright red color and it looked like multiple solar panels floating in the sky?  I continued to observe the area but never heard any sounds or saw anything else just one solid pulse of bright red light and what looked like solar panels??;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

I was looking east when 3 black objects flew by in formation from North to South. They looked large and they were moving quite fast with no sound. If I had not been looking in that area at that moment I wouldn't have noticed them as they were dark or black rectangle objects. No lights.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Silent glowing rectangle cruises across the night sky;2021-03-12 03:45:00;90-120 seconds;Silent glowing rectangle cruises across the night sky About 3:45 in the morning I came out of my friend's apartment and walked to the parking lot with him as I got into my car I stopped and looked up in the sky and thought what was that I told my friend to look up at that we both started to stare at all but by the sky in front of us was a gigantic white almost glowing rectangle it looked so close like you could almost touch it but yet it was still really far away has it went over us very very silently it seemed that everything around it was completely silent as well couldn't grab my phone couldn't do much of anything just stop and stare it went slowly past us and hasn't went over as it seem to be sunny then as well it kept going from west to east across the night sky and then has it got maybe the 20 yards away from the original point of siding it seemed to Glow really bright and has got brighter and brighter mate's way into two then there were two rectangles going across the sky and then it started to go again,  and then it became one again has it got about maybe 50 yards away from there a red light started to emerge from behind it and then that light circled around from the back almost to the front but just kind of in the middle of front and has that light connected to the middle of the front it just vanished;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
