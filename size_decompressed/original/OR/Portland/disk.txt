A disc shaped craft that appeared to be made of metal.;1975-08-19 21:00:00;5 minutes;a disc shaped craft that appeared to be made of metal. I was 12 years old and My Aunt and I witnessed the disk shaped craft from a distance of 100 feet. The saucer made no sound as it flew over Her house and headed north, after traveling several blocks at about 3 MPH it made a right angle turn to the west and accelerated towards the coast mountain range and then shot straight up at speeds beyond My describing.  It appeared to go into orbit in about 3 seconds.  The only other fact I can swear to is it looked exactly like the disc's Bob Lazar claimed to have worked on in area 51.

hovering saucer with colored lights flew and stopped twice suddenly,  changed to a silver gray muted appearance in the distance;1988-06-01 00:00:00;1 minute;hovering saucer with colored lights flew and stopped twice suddenly,  changed to a silver gray muted appearance in the distance This is what I reported on mufon in 1988:  Long Description of Sighting Report I was walking upstairs and looked out a large window where the stairs turned at the halfway point.  I saw a multi color lighted saucer shaped thing hovering silently just 10-15 feet away. It was no more than 1.5 feet in diameter.  I thought someoneone had a neat remote controlled flying saucer.  I watched it when suddenly it flew away at a high rate of speed, faster than what seemed possible.  I remember watching it fly several several blocks thinking that where I perceived it to be, at this distance, I shouldn't be able to see it anymore. It also may have appeared grey at this distance.  Then it was gone. I sat there thinking did this just happen? What was this?  The moment was gone, and I wished I could have it back, it was just too strange. I still think about this today.  In reading my above description in 2019 I think it may have been up to 3 feet in diameter.  It had colored lights, it was hovering near the ground, so I was looking down it.  From this position it flew several houses up the street and stopped suddenly still displaying lights.  It then flew to another position further away, again stopped suddenly and at this time it appeared a dull silver gray.  It then darted off in yet another direction and was gone. I think it would be helpful if common features of sightings could be compiled How many changed colors or lost color?  Sudden stops in the sky? sharp turns?  Size?  How many were as small as mine?;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

The sighting was about 11:33 p.m. Sept 2, 1998.  White luminous disk traverses 70% of the northern horizon from east to west in 1 to 2 seconds parallel to horizon.  It was too high to be a plane over the Portland Airport yet quit low and too parallel to the horizon to be a shooting star.  Within 10 seconds another (more faint) object was seen traveling at a high rate of speed (yet much slower) in a northerly direction over (what I would call) the coastline of Oregon.  This was too fast to be a plane but much slower than the east-west object.  Yet both objects had a similar destination west of the coastline of the Northwest U.S. and disappeared.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Craft forms Triangle, becomes portal right over 1-5;2002-02-08 19:00:00;60 minutes +;Craft forms Triangle, becomes portal right over 1-5 Watch on the hillside across from us in the 1-5 corradore, 3 craft suddenly poped into view, forming a triangle  pointing to a red glow on the ground. the craft would fluctuate position and sometimes freeze in position. The right corner craft would leave the formation... and slowly follow the air traffic lane, whice goes right through there, then suddenly reappear near the triangle again. sometimes electricity could be seen around the red light on the ground..then a small red light would come out of it. and see to float to a craft alongside the triangle hovering amoungst the tree top level. The recieving craft and one of the triangle craft would brighten and twinkle when this would happen. then the right corner craft would slowly leave and follow the air path again... and reappear a few minutes later. This was a movement patteren repeated several times. We were building up feelings of hatred and go home... and when we would project this at them, and twice i saw them *duck* or swoop , as if avoiding a projectile. I have noticed single craft in that area for a couple of years now, but this was the 1st show and multiple craft event. I feel its some kind of portal, and i observed <what appeared to be> human aircraft fading in from the triangle area, and following the air path away. Only 1 - 2 of the saucers would fly away tho. I feel this happens at this place now and then, but the single crafy can be seen rather often. ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what a portal is.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Oregon UFO Review Case:  Disk w/dull reddish glow.;2002-02-11 20:30:00;30 seconds;Disk w/dull reddish glow. This report is submitted to Oregon UFO Research from the same witness who reported the 1-16-02 sighting from Portland. Witness testimony... I have attached some JPEG files that I made to document what I saw last night (2-11-02 8:30 P.M.). I was out on my usual walk with the dog (again) and I caught site of it out of the corner of my eye as it passed overhead. I was walking east (again) about 15 minutes into my walk when I spotted it. The object was passing over me (to the south slightly) on my right at what I thought was a low altitude maybe 1000 to 2500 feet. It was a reddish object, disc in shape. It passed over at a high rate of speed without noise. The dull reddish glow was at a low level until after it had gained a lot of altitude. At this point the glow became very bright like a light emitting diode red. It's path was to the east for about 5 seconds and then swooping vertical (circular shape became very noticeable) and the streaking off to the south in a split second. I saw whatever it was for only about 20 to 30 seconds before it disappeared. It was very clear and cold last night, the visibility was fabulous... stars all around and no clouds. I made the accompanying files with AutoCAD for documentation purposes only. I have talked to nobody nor have I showed these file to anyone. OUFOR would like to thank this witness for the extra mile he went to document his sighting in such detail. Eric Byler - Oregon UFO Research.

Black saucer wobbled slowly as it gained altitude.;2002-12-22 14:20:00;5 min.;Black saucer wobbled slowly as it gained altitude. One object seen.  Black disc, wobbling (similar to a coin spinning slowly on desk), horizontal orientation, 1 wobble/second.  Wobble allowed a clear disc shape to be seen, then flat and not any noticable hight dimension to it.  Gained altitute slowly from about a 30 degree angle off of the horizon against an overcast sky.  Moved to my left while rising until it reached the lower level of clouds, then it moved to the right and eventually stopped moving or gaining altitude at approx. 65 degree angle from horizon.  Eventually, the clouds covered it. Also, there were no lights or any other markings visible on the craft which seemed about a mile away.  To my eye, at that distance, it looked about the same size as a street sign from 60 yards away. No helicopter or jet sounds heard.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Wobbling Disc Daylight Sighting;2003-11-25 16:10:00;2 to 3 minutes;Wobbling Disc Daylight Sighting I was in back of our house looking at the sky and noticed an odd looking object. I was not sure what I was seeing at first. The object was wobbling slowly. It was moving slowly from South to North, against the prevailing winds, which were blowing West to East. I would estimate the alititude at 1500 to 2000 feet. The sun was low in the sky. The object was reflecting sunlight from western edge, and appeared to be a silver disc shape with a brown or dark colored center. I would estimate the diameter of the object to be about 20 to 30 feet. I could not hear any sound from it. I ran in the house and got my binoculars, which took about 30 seconds. When I returned the object was gone. If it had been some sort of balloon it would have still been in sight. There was a small private airplane approaching the area where I had last seen the object. Duration of the sighting was about 2 to 3 minutes. ((BEGIN FOLLOW-UP MESSAGE FROM WITNESS)) Hi Peter, I just filed a report on an object that I saw here in Portland late this afternoon. I had been watching the object for 2 or 3 minutes, and decided that it was probably not a mylar balloon or something like that. It was moving Northward towards me, and appeared to be moving against the wind. I ran to get the binocs, and it had flat vanished, which surprised me. I didn't get a feel for the size distance or altitude of the object until I had returned with the binoculars. There was a small private plane moving into the vicinity of where I had last seen the object. I don't know if the pilot had seen it or not. The plane seemed to be a bit lower than the object. Which would have meant the object was much larger than I had susupected. If the object had been something floating on the wind it could not have disappeared in the 30 seconds, or so, that it took me to get my binoculars. That is why I was surprised that it was gone from sight when I returned, back outside. I had the distinct feeling, at that point, that this had been an intelligently controlled craft, it had seen the small plane flying in it's direction, and had vacated the vicinity.  By the way, when I had finished filing the report I went in and looked at the reports from Oregon and read the ones from 11/6/03. I live about 1 1/2 miles Southwest of the control tower at PDX, and about 20 blocks South of Lombard. Not too far from where those 2 sightings happened. I watch the air traffic all the time, day and night. Today's sighting was about the 4th one I've had at this location, in a little over three years, since we have lived here.  It's good to hear your reports again on Coast to Coast AM! Keep up the the good work and the good fight! Oh, I'll try and stay off the computer for awhile, in case you want to call me.  Best regards, ((END MESSAGE));45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Fast moving round object at night.;2004-03-18 01:00:00;20 seconds?;Fast moving round object at night. Just a bright object moving across the sky faster than any human craft I've ever seen. It looked round (might have been slightly oval shaped, not sure) and moved from in front of my house to behind my house and so far away that I could not see it anymore in around 20 secs or so. It was about the size of a dime in the sky, so either it was really big and far away, or it was small and close. However, judging from the angle it dissapeared out of my site, I would have to say that it was at least fairly high in the sky. At first I thought it was just a balloon floating a couple hundred feet in the air at an angle...but then I realized: 1. It was too bright to be a balloon (this was 1am) and 2. it was moving too fast. I stayed and looked at the sky for about 2 minutes after it was out of sight and right before I went in saw what looked like a military surveilance plane flying overhead (It looked like one and wasn't using the normal commercial flight paths). Oh! one more thing...The object (unlike planes that fly in the area) didn't make any noise.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
Circular shaped space craft moved slowly in the sky, hovered, then shot off.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly not a serious report.  PD));2004-12-14 00:00:00;5 - 10 seconds;A circular shaped space craft moved slowly in the sky, hovered a moment, then shot out of the atmosphere leaving a green colored streak I looked up into the night sky and saw a peculiar light (s) or sorts. I stopped and stood in the middle of the street on this crystal clear night, as I was taking my dog out for some fresh air. After assessing it was not a plane, nor sattle light, not any sort of shooting star, blimp, or anything I'd ever seen before. It moved slowly to the right and up a little, and stopped to hover for a moment. It was well up in the sky and must have been just over Vancouver, Wa. as I was facing North in SE Portland. I could distinguish multiple lights when it hovered, which were seemingly white or mildly off white/yellow. It then began to move up and to the right a little more and then *swoosh* it shot out of our atmosphere, and left green tracer like streaks behind it, just like one would see on Star Trek. I knew I had seen, for just a moment, something unbeknownst to me. It was real, and I am quite sure I saw a flying saucer. Nothing 'rational'could change my mind. Do they have something to do with planet Nemesis,.. I wonder.. sometimes I think we are like a petrie dish for these traveling beings. Nothing could shock me to find out about it all. Thank you.

Orange disk-like orbs over Downtown Portland.  ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  PD));2005-05-01 01:00:00;5 minutes;Orange disk-like orbs over Downtown Portland approx 1:00 AM Relaxing on balcony (approx 60 feet up) with 4 friends first vessel seen moving South parallel to the river over downtown Portland. From our vantage point seemed to be moving over the Wells Fargo tower, altitude unknown, but relatively low.  Object was very bright and there was a visible halo. The vessel appeared to be orb-like due to the extremely bright orange fire-colored halo, but on further observation with my trusty discovery channel telescope, there was a definite disk-like shape. The lights seemed to be at the bottom of the ship, the top of the ship was very hard to make out but was definatley a very large metal structure.  A second ship of same description came into view moving at the same slow, lurking speed, almost as if they were patrolling or searching for something, a third ship comes into view a few moments later.  All three ships pass the northeast corner of the building and are no longer visible.  We run down the stairs to watch them move across the rest of the sky. They have stopped moving across the city. They are in a clear triangular formation like a 90 degree triangle and are moving vertically up and out of the atmosphere until they can no longer be seen.  Very Strange and awesome but spine tingling and scary as well. ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  We are uncertain whether the report is meant to be a serious report.  We received no other reports of this incident, which seems strange to us, although there were reports submitted from other locations on the west coast for the same time period, about which the witness was not aware, since they were not posted at the time we received this report.

A disk shaped object with a haze stood in one place then moved from side to side. Ten others followed with bright lights.;2005-06-25 20:50:00;10;A disk shaped object with a haze stood in one place then moved from side to side. Ten others followed with bright lights. June 25, 2005 -- At around 10:50 pm, we were driving down Division St. and at the intersection with 164th, the driver looked up in the sky and saw a light. She thought that it was a star, but it was too big and bright to be one and the other two people in the car looked as well, and the object seemed to move on its side. When it turned to the side, we saw a disk shape, which had a haze of light around it. The object was wider than the moon but length seemed a lot smaller. The passenger even put on her glasses in disbelief, but she still saw the object. After we all started screaming, we went down until 174th, and right when we took a right, two more objects moved near from the right. One of the incoming objects was bigger than the other, but they were moving towards the big one that was first sighted. Quickly, we went to our house and looked out the window. In the same direction we saw two or three of the same object moving back and forth and also stopping for a few seconds. The objects looked like bright lights (bigger than stars, and brighter) and they were not flashing. They all seemed to be coming from the same direction and going in the same direction (east to west). We figured they could not be planes because they were not flashing, and they were moving so quickly, yet stopping every now and then.  Also, two of them came very close in contact, almost touching each other. After about nine of those objects moved towards the right, we could not see them because of the trees. Later on, after they were gone, we looked towards the sky, and we saw two planes pass by in a 45 min span. We could differentiate between the object and the plane. The plane had a constant shape, was slanted and had the flashing tail lights. We also called the non-emergency line to check for helicopters in the area, and we were told that there was nothing going on. They also gave us the number for the UFO center. If anyone saw something, please speak up. We didn’t believe in UFOs until tonight. Can someone explain whether so many objects, whether they are planes, helicopters, blimps or anything else can do such motions in the sky without colliding. How can they stop and go (shift left to right)?;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

Something was flying over downtown Portland on August 6th;2008-08-06 12:00:00;don't know but  :10 secon;Something was flying over downtown Portland on August 6th My friend was visiting me in Portland a few weeks ago from Germany and he was taking some video of downtown Portland while sightseeing in the aerial tram.  Later he was watching the footage after uploading it on his computer and he noticed something hovering over the city like a helicopter but then take with a speed and angle that we don't think could possibly be a helicopter or plane.  We have no idea what it was or even if perhaps it was a reflection or something but it sure looks like something that is flying.   I'm interested in seeing what any experts might think.  The incident happened on August 6th at around noon and like I said he was in the portland aerial tram looking down over downtown.  As for witnesses there were others in the tram but no one saw anything or had any reaction at the time.

Cloaked light disc pretends to be a cloud formation.;2012-09-20 13:00:00;15 minutes;Cloaked light disc pretends to be a cloud formation. At this time I lived in the northwest as I grew up in Oregon City Area.  I was outside on my back porch located in the Gresham Oregon area. My back porch faced west towards downtown Portland Oregon.  It was a mostly clear day a little after 1pm I believe.  I noticed what looked like a cloud formation moving toward me from downtown Portland area.  This storm front caught my attention because it didn’t look like any I had ever seen before.  It was perfectly rounded with no stray clouds.  There was a bright orange cloud at the center.  The formation took up my entire westerly view.    As I watched it approach my home I noticed it was moving faster then a normal cloud system. Once this cloud system passed over my home I looked back at it and could see exactly what this bright light in the center of this mass of clouds was.  It was a glowing light disc as bright as the sun.  There were no other lights only one solid disc of yellow white light.I even caught a picture of this light disc but somehow got erased from my mini disc in my phone.  This experience changed my life forever.  The possibility’s are endless as this craft apparently had the ability to either attract clouds to it magnetically, or project a cloud hologram around it.  This light disc did not make a sound and was at the standard altitude of clouds.  What’s even more amazing is air traffic constantly flies into PDX over that area.  That same year I had two other amazing experiences.  In my research I have come to learn these exotic technologies have been hidden from the public going back Thousands of years.  I wondered why they would fly this object over a heavily populated area.  The only answer I could come up with is that they wanted to test there cloaking technology.  I often wonder if I am the only one who noticed it that day.  I assume nobody thought anything of it and thought it was just some clouds in the sky.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

After about 3 seconds it suddenly changed direction and went down quickly at about 30 degree angle-below and in front of the horizon.  I lost sight because a house blocks that part of  my view.  Several seconds later it shot up into view at about the same angle it had gone down, and it travelled horizontally for about 2 seconds and then went down again at about 30 degrees and I lost sight of  it again behind the house.

Looked out window. spotted red & white lights on a circular object. I woke up earlier than usual and was sitting up in bed when the window completely illuminated the room with a bright flash of light that lasted about 5 seconds.  It gave me a strong feeling of fear, wondering what it could possibly have been.   After sitting stunned for about 5 minutes, I looked out the window and immediately noticed some lights in the distance on what appeared to be a round “ship” that had red and white lights.  It looked to be descending down but was traveling at an odd speed & strange fashion.   This just happened about a half an hour ago.   I am generally very skeptical about paranormal things so the whole situation left me dumbfounded & severely creeped out. ((ADDENDUM FROM ORIGINAL SOURCE OF THIS REPORT)) I entered the wrong year on my last form.  I was sitting up in bed after I had been awakened by something that I could not identify.  A few minutes after awakening, a bright flash of light that lasted about 5 seconds illuminated the room.  It gave me an extremely fearful feeling so after sitting stunned for about 5 minutes, I managed to look out the window.  I immediately noticed red & white flashing lights on a circular looking object in the distance.  The object was flying at an odd speed & the flight pattern was strange.  At first it looked to be descending quickly, much much faster than an airplane.  After the event my cat was whining and acting out of character.  The whole situation left me dumbfounded & extremely creeped out.  I won’t be falling back to sleep anytime soon. ((END ADDENDUM);45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418

Posted Mar 11, 2020 PORTLAND — A Portland police officer’s patrol car was struck by a U.F.O. on Interstate 205 late Tuesday, causing serious injuries to the officer. The police are still looking for the driver responsible. Early information suggests the officer was working a “static detail” at a construction site on the northbound interstate south of Southeast Division Street when a driver hit the officer’s vehicle from behind and then drove off, according to Portland police. The officer was hospitalized with serious injuries that didn’t threaten their lives, according to police. Portland Police’s Major Crash Team is now investigating the hit and run, however, no arrests have been made in connection with the case.  They encourage anyone who has information about the crash — specifically anyone who saw the U.F.O. beforehand — to call 503-823-3333.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
I saw a dark, shiny/reflective disc shaped object traveling overhead, rotating sporadically as it traveled from the SW the NE;2021-01-25 09:50:00;approx. 50 seconds;I saw a dark, shiny/reflective disc shaped object traveling overhead, rotating sporadically as it traveled from the SW the NE I was in my backyard looking up at the sky stretching my arms, at about 9:50am this morning (January 25th, 2021) (at least once or twice a day I go barefoot outside with my dog when it’s not raining so I can ground and stretch and get some fresh air even though it’s cold) when I noticed a flying object appear to be traveling from the NW at about 45 degrees, give or take, from the horizon.  It seemed to be soaring, so for a split second  I thought it was a bird but I kept watching, and it appeared to be round and disc shaped, no wings/tail, completely round or possibly ovular, dark colored/probably black, maybe dark chrome colored, and it reflected light as it rotated so I think it was constructed of something reflective/shiny/solid with no markings.  I did not notice any lights. It moved in a steady arc across the sky above me slightly over my left shoulder so not directly overhead but over the south eastern part of the sky. I ran inside to grab my phone (only ! took me a few seconds) and tried to turn my video camera on but didn’t press the start button, only switched it from photo to video (I thought I was video recording it, but I wasn’t unfortunately). The entire sighting lasted somewhere between 30 and 60 seconds approximately. The object was small, smaller than the sun would be, and it seemed to be at a relatively high altitude. When it rotated it did so in a sporadic manner and didn’t change course/trajectory. It sometimes remained stable without spinning (still maintaining the same speed) for a few seconds give or take and then it would rotate in varying directions. The object didn’t emit any sound or trail. It just kept going on it’s course until it was behind the treeline in the NE and I couldn't see it anymore. I live in SE Portland close to Hwy 205 and Stark. Very close to the SE Portland Police Bureau: East Precinct.;45.5119926041666;-122.668649635418
