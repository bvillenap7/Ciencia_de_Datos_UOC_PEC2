I was camping at Laurance Lake.  It was around 10:30 pm..sitting around the campfire. I have never seen something in the sky that I couldn't logically explain. As I was staring at the stars I noticed a HUGE white thing traveling in the sky between two of the brightest stars  in the sky. I believe now those stars to be Venus and Jupiter.  I am terrible with directions and angles, but I am pretty certain I was looking in the West. I thought, It's to high and big to be a plane. It's to low and big to be a satellite.  I turned to a friend, pointed to the general location and said, What is that?  He was a local and familiar with anything and everything about the outdoors.  Umm..that's a plane. We should see it's lights here in a sec. We engaged in a quick discussion about the objects activity while staring at it..really just waiting to see something else but the triangular bright white lights.  This object was steadily moving across the sky then suddenly started to ascend. In a fraction of a second shot, it straight up and disappeared. I was speechless.  I am 47 years old and have spent countless hours gazing at the stars.  This was incredible.;45.4862;-121.5916
