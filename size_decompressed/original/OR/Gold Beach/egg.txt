While we waited to see where it would go we were talking and drinking beers for a couple of minutes while we smoked a cigarette when both neighbors' dogs started going mad and then we both heard what sounded like something on my grandmother's roof and then a large drone or small aircraft quickly pass overhead except for it’s flight system sounded like when you light a tube of hydrogen on fire and expose it to air and much larger than my uncles $15,000 drone.  And the next morning I woke up with a mark that ya quickly healed on my chest that’s now a surgical scar right over my heart in between two ribs;42.4071;-124.4271
