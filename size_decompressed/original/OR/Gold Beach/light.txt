Easterly advanced of center light & went So.east center remained statitonary 30 sec.  All vanishedpoof! NO sound. Not Russian Rocket. 3rd sighting in 2 years all early morn.  This one was the closest. Old timers here are used to it. I believed the Russian rocket stuff until I read the Oregonina last week which said it all happened around 9:30p.m.  At first I thought it was a plane except 1. it was to close to the tideline(the coast is scatered with monoliths) 2. too big for the small planes that land at this airport. 3 red lights in a tight V formation.  The light on the most westerly side broke first and went due north.  The light on the easterly advanced of the center an went due south. The center stayed stationary then was gone.  These lights were bright as headlights and steady until they vanished. The folks that have grown-up around here say these sightings are common.;42.4071;-124.4271

4 Balls of Light Travelling at High Speeds in Gold Beach, OR;2007-07-27 22:00:00;20 to 30 seconds?;4 Balls of Light Travelling at High Speeds in Gold Beach, OR At approximately 9:50pm Pacific Time while gazing at the stars which I do every night, I saw what appeared to be 3 white balls of light flying at high speeds.  One was travelling North, one passed it flying South and then another one was travelling East. There were no flashing lights normally seen on airplanes. There was also no sound at all.  Whether these were new military aircraft or UFO's I don't know.  It did seem rather odd that they were all flying about the same speeds, at the same time, in different directions.  Also they were very high up in the sky, not lower where airplanes would normally be seen.  If they were jets why didn't I hear them?  I don't think I've ever heard any major aircraft flying in this area...we have no major airport for several miles.  Unless they're making aircraft much more discreet and quiet? Also, at about 10:00pm I saw another one same high speed, same white ball of light very high up in the sky, no flashing lights travelling South East...it seemed to disappear or fade off.
