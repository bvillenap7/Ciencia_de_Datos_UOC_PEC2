White, oval-shaped pulsating lights seen above my house, as well as two saucers seen hovering two days later.;2017-06-17 23:45:00;1 hour;white oval shaped pulsating lights seen above my house as well as two saucers seen hovering two days later I was pulling into my driveway at approximately 23:45 on June 17th, 2017, so it was last Saturday.  Right when I got out of the car, my neighbor came running over to me and asked me if I knew what the strange lights were directly above my house, so I looked up and saw these strange oval bright lights that were pulsating and zooming out and would then fly back in.  They were a bright white and seemed to form a pattern.  I have never seen anything like it in my life and my neighbor who is from Arizona, had never seen anything like it either.  The lights appeared to be approximately 200 feet above my house. Then two days ago on June 23rd, 2017 my uncle who lives close by, was standing out on his deck with binoculars, and he said he could see two flying saucer like objects hovering above my house.  One was approximately 50 to 200 feet above he thought and the other was directly above that one, about 500 feet above the roof of my house.  They had red, orange and green lights on them and hovered there for about one hour.  This occurred at about 23:45 again until about 1:30 in the morning.  I was asleep during this time so I did not see them but my uncle called me to let me know. I have never experienced anything like this before and I have never studied UFOâ€™s or been a watcher of them.  I have recently moved to the Oregon Coast from the valley area of Oregon.;44.4091;-124.0339
