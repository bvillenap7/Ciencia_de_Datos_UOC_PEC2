5 lights seen in night sky over ocean.;2012-08-26 22:30:00;15-20 minutes;5 lights seen in night sky over ocean It was around 10pm.  There was a high layer of clouds over the ocean.  We were playing cards and noticed two lights out over the ocean, they moved at a medium speed, not slow and not fast.  They first moved up and then horizontally and back, one then moved down.  Three others appeared and moved up.  Then they moved out of sight into the clouds.  There was no sign of a ship or boat on the ocean, no lights on the waterâ€¦  After going to bed I woke around 3am and got up to get a drink of water.  I looked out and noticed one light in the sky in the same manner as the original five.;44.4091;-124.0339
