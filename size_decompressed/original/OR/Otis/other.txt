Slower than normal meteor speed. While standing in my front yard, I looked up and saw a crescent shaped, bright, blue-white object traveling from west,sowest-to east,noeast.From when I first saw it to when it disappeared it traversed 35 to 40 deg. It just went out about 60 deg above the eastern horizon. It left no trail and it lasted approx. 4 seconds. the size of the object was approx.1/2 the width of my thumbnail as I held my hand out at arms length.  I am a former Airforce airways communications specialist. I am 65 years old and am in good health. It was moving too fast for an aircraft and too slow for a meteor.;45.0169;-123.9402
Two faint star-like objects moving in a straight line, exactly with one another, slowly across the sky.;2004-07-08 23:15:00;4 minutes;Two faint star-like objects moving in a straight line, exactly with one another, slowly across the sky. There were two objects. They looked like faint stars approximately one inch apart holding my hand straight out in front of me. They were in a straight line, one on top of the other and moving exactly along with one another. They moved very slowly. I watched them moving roughly north across the sky and it took them about 4 minutes to do so. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible satellites, orbiting in proximity to one another??  PD));45.0169;-123.9402
Invisible object caught in photo with orbs;2020-09-02 11:00:00;15 minutes?;Invisible object caught in photo with orbs Was looking upward toward the southeast at what I believed to be insects swarming in the atmosphere.  They really caught my eye in the sunlight so I stepped back to let the edge of the roof block the sun while I observed.  The insects appeared to be randomly flying around and then collecting into a group and moving eastward.  They seemed to ‘poof’ out in a ball with a small strand of insects linking ball after ball.  I remarked at the behavior to my spouse.  He has vision issues so I normally take photos of low contrast things for him to get a better view.  After 5 shots increasing the zoom, I showed the photos and was surprised to see the oblong feature.  It was not visible to the naked eye.  It was large enough that my spouse could have seen that. I did note a contrail to the west as I looked around the sky, unusual for this area.;45.0169;-123.9402
