The flashes are extremely bright, much more so than anything we have ever seen in the night sky.  It starts out when one of us sees the first flash then we watch it cover the horizon in seconds in about 3 flashes.  Sometimes straight and others with sharp turns.  Not sure if it is military and some kind of pulse engine but never any noises and not a beacon light like a plane.  If my iPhone would film night sky better, I could film it easy.;45.0169;-123.9402
