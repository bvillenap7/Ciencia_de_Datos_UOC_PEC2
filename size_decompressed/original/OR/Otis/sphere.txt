Silver basketball size sphere chases eagle.;1998-08-10 15:00:00;3 minutes;Silver basketball size sphere chases eagle. A small (basketball size) silver sphere appeared just beyond a pair of bald eagles I was observing through binoculars.  The sphere appeared to purposely single out the smaller female eagle and begand to close in on her. She obviously became agitated and broke off from the male and circled trying to lose her pursuer which followed her every move until she had completed a complete circle, the sphere then broke off the engagement and disappeared behind trees to the west as she went east and resumed her position with her mate. They then disappeared behind the hills behind my house. I had thought that perhaps the object may have been a silver coated helium party balloon, however, after reading about the Washington State Elk incident, and having just observed a real balloon floating over my house, I realize that in now way was this sphere a balloon. I now light floating objects can be caught up in the wake of a plane and sucked along a ways, but this sphere did not behave in the manner the real balloon I just saw behaved. Since this episode, I have seen video on TV of objects similar to this in Mexico City following airplanes. By the way, the balloon I saw bounced erratically and the string was easily visible with binoculars.  This sphere had no string and flew smoothly. No sound was audible.
