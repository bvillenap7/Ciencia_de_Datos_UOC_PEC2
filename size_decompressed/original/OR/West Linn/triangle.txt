Low-flying UFO in Residential Neighborhood in West Linn, Oregon;2010-03-19 20:00:00;5 seconds;Low-flying UFO in Residential Neighborhood in West Linn, Oregon I walked outside my condo to walk the dog at around 8:00 pm and it was dark except for the stars and the crescent moon.  Instantly I heard dogs barking and howling in the Northwest direction of the neighborhood. Right away I looked up in the sky and I always do when I go outside, and to my left I saw a low-flying SILENT vehicle that was heading Southeast to Northwest direction.  It was close enough (about 100 yards up) that I saw the bottom of the triangle shaped vehicle.  I was thinking it would hit some trees or crash because it was so low.  I could see the bottom of the jet sized vehicle, but it was triangle shaped and didn't look like a plane or jet.  There were bright orange lights on the bottom.  I watched it zoom by at about 100 miles an hour - it looked like a fast moving car speed.  I could only watch the vehicle between the trees, probably for about 5 seconds.  We ran to see if we could see anything on the other side of the trees but it was no where in sig! ht.  The dogs kept barking when the vehicle passed over where the barking noises came from.  After the vehicle had passed I stayed outside looking in the sky for other signs and I saw a lighter gray trail in the sky.  It was probably from some airplane though because is was straight and further up in the sky than the low-flying vehicle.;45.3642;-122.6443
