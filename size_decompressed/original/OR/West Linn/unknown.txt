Spinning at an odd pitch and rhythm. Abrupty started and abruptly stopped. Wife and I were laying in bed approx 9:15 last night.  Heard a sudden very loud whirring noise like that of spinning turbines directly above our house.  We do live within range of the flight path of Canby airport and frequently hear airplanes and helicopters in the distance.  This was unlike any sound my wife and I have ever heard the pitch and rhythm (if you will) was very different and very loud.  It started as a higher pitched whine and settled in to a low rumble keeping the same wierd rhythm then went silent.   After a couple minutes it started up again (again, directly overhead.)with the sound going in reverse of the way it started and then after reaching a higher pitched whine, dead silence.  We looked at each other and neither wanted to say what that noise just sounded like.  My wife swears it sounded like a horizontal spin.  I couldnt tell the difference I was more amazed by the pitch of the sound.   Also noticed that the outside lights! I can see from my bedroom seem to have been off during the incident.  Assumed I had forgotten to turn them on before turning in. Woke up this morning, they were all on.   Found this website this morning never been on, never posted before.  Heard planes in the sky approx 10 min later.   We both agreed that wasnt even close to the sound we heard.  Neither of us wanted to go outside to investigate during or after.  Feels like this is so wild most people (myself included) would dismiss this story coming from anyone else as crazy and un-credible.  Which is why Im posting anonomysly.;45.3642;-122.6443
