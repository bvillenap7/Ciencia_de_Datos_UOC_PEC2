flashing color-changing light in south sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly Sirius??  PD));2021-04-15 21:30:00;70 minutes;flashing color-changing light in south sky Cloudless night, i stepped out the front door to stargaze. saw what i initially thought was an approaching commercial jet, but after several minutes i realized it was not perceptibly moving. at a glance it had about the size and brightness of venus or some other prominent star, but it was flashing and alternating colors, orange and blue. called my daughter a few blocks away and she corroborated. it was probably by a small margin the brightest thing in the sky. it seemed to be stationary for at least 30 minutes and then moved gradually away (got dimmer/smaller, less flashy) and somewhat to the west and eventually out of view.;45.3642;-122.6443
