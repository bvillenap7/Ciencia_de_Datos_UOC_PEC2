It had every light you could imagine.  It was disc/sand dollar shaped on a 60' angle. It was covered in lights - every color imaginable and hovered for over an hour in one spot. It appeared to seperate into 2 distinct objects for a time then came back together. It eventually moved due south and disappeared from view.;45.3642;-122.6443
