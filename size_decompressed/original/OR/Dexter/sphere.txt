Sphere flying from east with lightning flashes;2020-05-29 23:00:00;continuous;Sphere flying from east with lightning flashes Yellow/Orange sphere flew in a wave pattern from west to east and landed near the Willamette National Forest. Where it was flying was accompanied by bright flashes of light that lit up the whole sky like a strobe or lightning, yet the sky was clear of clouds.  After it landed, we could see the strobe effect, without regularity in timing. We drove towards it but never found it. We watched the continuous strong flashes for the next few hours, and eventually saw a really bright shooting star going very slow in the sky above it.  The flashes continued for hours. We eventually went inside. It resembled a lightning ball or plasma storm.;43.9217;-122.8424
