Double cone travels northeast to southwest from over Eugene, OR. toward south of Oakridge, OR area at 3:30;2005-07-02 03:30:00;3 to 4 min;Double cone travels northeast to southwest from over Eugene, OR. toward south of Oakridge, OR area at 3:30 I was watching a burn pile with my dog beside me ( I was laying on my back about 8' from the fire looking up watching shooting stars) and noticed him looking up at the sky to the west.  I looked once and saw nothing then noticed him looking up again.  I looked up and saw a object that seemed more like two cones fat sides together (roughly diamond shaped from directly below) moving steadily across the sky.  There was a steady white light from the center and I also noticed as it traveled across my view (from west to east) twice a sort of light purple wave (sort of like a corona) flash away in different directions from the craft.  It made no sound that I could hear but my dog could obviously hear it.  It was seemingly pretty high (mile???) but it's shape was still obvious so it must have been pretty large (guess of more than 100' from tip to tip??)  It dwindled out quickly to the east (did not disappear behind a mountain, just suddenly dwindled) and that was it.  It was very obviously not an aircraft (light because I could discern it's shape and there was no noise.;43.9217;-122.8424
