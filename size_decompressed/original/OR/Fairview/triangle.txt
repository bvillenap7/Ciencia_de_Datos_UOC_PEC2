I looked up and there was a lit triangle shape craft flying low and was much larger than a plane.  I knew it wasn't a plane because none of the lights were flashing, they were all white and they weren't arranged where lights would usually be on an airplane.  Aside from the two lights at the base of what triangle there were two lights at the tip.  It somehow got from one side of the sky to the other in maybe a second and then vanished.  I was in such aw I didn't have time to grab my phone and I can only hope that someone got it on video.;45.5499;-122.4439
