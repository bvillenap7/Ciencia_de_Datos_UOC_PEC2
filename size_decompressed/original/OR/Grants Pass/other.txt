Started as lights in a field that looked like workers with flashlights, then the number of lights increased rapidly to 9 or so.  The lights then started to rise off the ground to aprox 300 ft.  And started slowly changing colors from purple, blue,red,green and orange.  They were moving in sequence until some dropped over mountain  and all disapated into a luminous fog which was like camouflage.;42.4576877358494;-123.346973584905
