Stayed there approx. 2 hours.  Had red, blue, yellow, green lights along middle that spun.  Approx. 10-15 yards from where we were. Two of my friends and I were sleeping outside in the front yard in the summer.  We were 7, 10 and 8 years of age at the time.  One of my friends sat up and start crying and pointing to the end of the driveway.  My other friend and I looked up and saw an object that looked like two bowls on top of each other with lights and gray squares (windows???) in the middle.  The lights spun around the object.  There was a very low hum coming from it.  We went into a panic and started trying to get into the house but it was locked because my friends parents were gone for the night.  So, we tried to think of a plan to get around the craft so that we could run down the street to my house which was two houses down.  But, we were to scared so we just climbed back into our sleeping bags and pulled it over our heads.  The dogs were going crazy in the house.  One kept on trying to jump through the window.  We stared at it for quite awhile.  It finally started hovering about 5 feet from the ground and slowly took off and hovered above the house across the street for about 10 minutes then it just took off so fast that we had a hard time following it with our eyes.  It went over the horizon and we booked it over to my house and never did sleep outside again that summer.  Too bad I didn't have a camera it would have been the best view and the closest of a ufo ever taken.;42.4576877358494;-123.346973584905
