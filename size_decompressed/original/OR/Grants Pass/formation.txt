Looking SE towards the coast, I noticed a few lights coming up from behind the pines in my neighbor's yard.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-24 22:07:00;1-2 minutes;Looking SE towards the coast, I noticed a few lights coming up from behind the pines in my neighbor's yard. As we continued to watch more and more of these lights were appearing.  There were at least 30 to 40 very bright lights.  These were in a single file formation, they appeared to be going straight up into the sky. The sky is very clear tonight ,we are able to see most stars very clear.  It seems to be a pretty dark night with no moon that we can see from where we are. After the lights faded out, and watching for about one to two minutes.  As soon as they were all gone the star just to the left of where the formation had disappeared.  It became really bright for about 5 seconds, than back to normal.  At which time all the dogs around our home including our three started barking.  They barked for about 10 minutes.;42.4576877358494;-123.346973584905
string of lights moving in a linear pattern and disappearing;2020-12-04 18:50:00;less than a minute;string of lights moving in a linear pattern and disappearing On Friday, November 4, 2020, at 7:49 pm PST, I witnessed a string of lights rising in the sky at a uniform rate from about 15 degrees above the horizon to about 45 degrees above the horizon due west of Grants Pass, Oregon. When first observed there were 5 or 6 lights equidistant from each other at about a 70-degree angle to the horizon.  They started to move up to a point above the highest light and more followed the lowest point. In all about 12 dots of light moved up and disappeared just above the point of the original highest light.  The dots of light were like the size of the stars in the night sky at that time.;42.4576877358494;-123.346973584905
