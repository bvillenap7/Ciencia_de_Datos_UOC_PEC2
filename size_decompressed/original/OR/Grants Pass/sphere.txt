Slow moving flames that interacted with a green light.;2016-03-18 21:35:00;3-4 minutes;Slow moving flames that interacted with a green light. Was outside last night locking the outbuildings and having a smoke. Saw a yellow flame moving slowly from the east right at the (partial) cloud level.  Thought it was a meteor at first, but the flame kept going. It headed towards a almost stationary green thing, about as bright as a big star, and they appeared to circle each other and headed lazily south.  Then two more flames came from the east, one after the other, and followed the green star and first flame which was much brighter than the rest. The brightest one illuminated the clouds a little, the rest were above the clouds and didn't illuminate them. They continued slowly south until they disappeared from view due to clouds & mountains. Don't think these were Chinese lanterns (but I've never seen one) because they were moving contrary to the clouds.  Clouds were moving towards the NNE at the time. There is a commercial air corridor here, but the aircraft only go north and south. Took a phone video of the last part of the event when they were moving away, but it's poor quality, all that can be seen are white dots.;42.4576877358494;-123.346973584905
