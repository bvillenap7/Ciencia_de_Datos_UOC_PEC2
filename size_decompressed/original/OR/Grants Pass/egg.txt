At 04:00 hours, I woke up to a flash of white light over our mountain top, about three seconds later I saw another flash, then I saw a egg shape white object fly over the mountain coming from the NE flying to the SW. After a second or two, another object with the same description followed behind and to the side of the first object.  I saw the white light that seem to make up the objects flash on and off for about six seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  One of several reports from same source in Grants Pass.
