Very large triangular shaped UFO siting, North-West, outlined in blinking red lights;2001-12-15 18:10:00;5 minutes;Very large triangular shaped UFO siting, North-West, outlined in blinking red lights I was driving to Eugene from Medford and happened to look up to the sky and through the clouds I saw a very large blinking red light.  I thought it was just an airplane as I couldn't see it clearly at first, but I kept looking at it as I was surprised in the large amount of area it was lighting up.  It was moving from North to West, now very rapidly, still blinking, then I saw its huge enormous size as it was blinking and realized that this wasn't an airplane, and had to be a ufo, no doubt in my mind. Triangular shape, very large, moving down West closer down into the mountains, outlined in red blinking lights.  I saw it out of the window as my mother was driving down the freeway.;42.4576877358494;-123.346973584905
red lighted triangle with circling white light at top tip came across sky then hovered.;2008-12-16 19:00:00;20 min;red lighted triangle with circling white light at top tip came across sky then hovered. I was sitting in my living room when I heard my neighbor scream, followed by her husband and brother and many neighbors across the street and  around the neighbor hood . At that point I ran outside to see what was going on. They were all looking up into the sky and pointing.  I witnessed what appeared to be a triangle hovering out in the distance that did not appear to look like any kind of craft I have ever seen before. Judging from the distance out it had to be really large. It had a white light that was circling around the top corner of the triangular shaped object. The rest of the craft or object was bright red in color and looked to have many lights on it all of which were red except the white one that was circling it. My neighbors said they watched it come across the horizon for about ten to fifteen minutes before it stopped and  hovered where if was.  As we were looking at the object it released a white lighted globe like thing that fell to earth.  We all screamed and kind of waited for an explosion or something to  happen but we could not see anything.   About 2 minutes after that it released another one that went from white to red as it dropped, then  its red lights all went dark from the outmost corners to the center, as it became one small white light and disappeared into the horizon. I grew up in Lancaster Ca. and being near Edwards Air Force base had seen some strange goings on sometimes, but I have never witnessed anything that strange or unexplained in my life. It made the pit of my stomach sink several times watching it.;42.4576877358494;-123.346973584905
Triangle shaped craft with three red lights at points hovering over Grants Pass, Oregon.;2010-01-01 00:00:00;A few mintues;Triangle shaped craft with three red lights at points hovering over Grants Pass, Oregon. Late on January first, me and two friends were driving in Grants Pass, Oregon. I noticed out the passenger window two red lights hovering in the sky. It was hovering in the air, much too low for any aircraft that I would normally see. It was dark, and cloudy, but the moon still kept in light enough to see. I watched it for a few more seconds, confused as to what I was really seeing. I pointed in the sky, and asked my friends if they saw taht was well. As we kept driving, we could see it from underneath and to the side. The UFO was a wide triangular shape, with two red lights that sort of blinked at each end on the back. At the front tip was another light, and underneath there seemed to be another light closer to the front. The craft was dark, and thick. It was close enough that I could see the wings were the thick side angles. The craft was sleek, like a jet, but wider then anything I have seen. We all grabbed our cameras and pulled the car over. As we did t! hough, the craft (still hovering in the same spot) begin to rise. We got out of the car and the craft was higher in the sky. Then, it turned to the right while staying in the same spot, about 90 degrees, and begin flying away. It moved away from us fast, and was too far to take a picture. Within mintues we had seen this craft hovering above the city, then turn to face the right in the same position, and leave. No military type craft can hover in one spot and then turn on a dime like that. Another strange thing was that there was no noise that came from the craft, it was silent.;42.4576877358494;-123.346973584905
