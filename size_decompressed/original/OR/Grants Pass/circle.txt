Three bright red cylinders changing to very bright white lights before disappearing at high speeds;2004-08-20 22:00:00;30 seconds;Three bright red cylinders changing to very bright white lights before disappearing at high speeds Initially, there was a very loud low rumble that soon showed twin red balls moving very fast for several seconds before disappearing very suddenly in a northwesterly direction.  After about 5-10 minutes the sound returned and there was a red cylinder shaped object in the north.  Suddenly, the cylinder became a very bright light like a search light had been turned on.  This was answered by another brigh light in the south and another in the west.  These lights stayed on for 10-20 seconds in a stationary position and then suddenly all three became red balls moving very quickly and disappearing to the west.  After another 10-15 minutes the same red cylinder was observed very high in the sky moving from west to east and the white light appeared three more times but at a very high elevation. ((NUFORC Note:  We received a telephoned report from this individual, and he seemed quite credible to us.  We have asked him to invite the other witnesses to submit reports, as well.

Stars appear, move and fade away.;2012-08-20 22:00:00;1 minute or less;Stars appear, move and fade away. I have been seeing stars that stay put and then slowly fade to a small pin point, then leave the area.  I have also seen stars that are bright take off across the sky, flash, move some more, then fade to a small, almost undetectable light across the sky, then disappear. This is happening at or around 9:30 to 11:00 pm.  I saw a star at the bottom of the big dipper handle, stayed for 1 minuit...then fade to a smaller light and take off. This has been happening almost every night for 2 or 3 weeks.;42.4576877358494;-123.346973584905
Pulsating white light, moving up and down and in small circles;2019-11-20 23:15:00;20 minutes;Pulsating white light, moving up and down and in small circles Looking south towards Grants Pass.  One circle.  Pulsating white lite.  Mostly hovering, however moving in small circles while rising and falling.  It appeared that two airplanes (flashing red light, moving in straight line) flew from the north and passed underneath and south of the pulsating light.  Eventually the light grew faint and moved west out of my line of sight.;42.4576877358494;-123.346973584905
