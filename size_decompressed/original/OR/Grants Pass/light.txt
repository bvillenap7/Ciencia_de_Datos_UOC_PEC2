Light appeared over mountain;1991-09-01 22:00:00;8 hrs;Light appeared over mountain I was outside watching meteor shower when a very bright light appeared over the mountain in front of me.  It hovered there for awhile and then went down behind the mountain.  Then it would reappear and go back down.  It repeated this for quite awhile.  It finally came back over the mountain and just stayed in one place for a loooong time. It would get very bright and then so dim that you could barely see it.  It slowly went across the sky and stopped.  There were clouds coming in and it would get covered in the clouds but didn't move other than getting brighter and dimmer it looked exactly like a star.  I watched it until the sun started coming up and I couldn't see it anymore.;42.4576877358494;-123.346973584905
Going across sky.  Thought it was airplane at first...until it started melting.;1992-02-01 20:00:00;10 minutes;Going across sky.  Thought it was airplane at first...until it started melting. Had just gotten home and was outside smoking a cigarette when I saw a light going across the sky.  I thought it was a plane.  It stopped all of a sudden and just stayed there.  All of a sudden it turned bright red and appeared to be on fire.  It started dripping like plastic would if heated.  I ran in and called 911 because I still thought it was an airplane.  The operator thought I was a crank call.  She put me on hold for about 2 minutes and got back online and asked me to tell her exactly what I was seeing.  I explained it to her and she told me that she had about 50 other calls coming in on the same thing.  My husband at the time was out video-taping it.  She asked me if she could have the fire department come over to look at the tape.  The fire chief arrived and watched the tape and shook his head and asked what we thought of ufo's.;42.4576877358494;-123.346973584905
Large bright light traveling low at a slow rate of speed with no sound;2001-08-14 21:48:00;Several minutes;Large bright light traveling low at a slow rate of speed with no sound My husband and I were going to bed when we saw out our bedroom window a large bright white light (not flashing) traveling low in a straight line north to south, at a slow rate of speed. I ran outside with a spot light and flashed it about six times, and it seem to burn out slowly before my eyes.  No sounds could be heard from it. We have been having a lot of sightings  in this area since moving here 8 years ago. ((NUFORC Note:  One of several reports from same source in Grants Pass.  PD));42.4576877358494;-123.346973584905

Several bright objects at great altitude and distance hovering over Grants Pass, Oregon.;2008-04-12 00:00:00;still ongoing;Several bright objects at great altitude and distance hovering over Grants Pass, Oregon. At first, my wife spotted only one moving object.  After going outside to investigate, we observed one bright light at what seemed to be a great altitude flashing red, green, and white light and moving in various movements.  At times, it would seem to be still, then it moved in one circular motion, and then reversed course and stopped.  At times, the object's movement seemed to be slow, and other times rapid jerking motions. After watching that object for approximately ten minutes and trying to get photos and looking through binoculars (it was hard to focus because of the tiny size of the appearance of the object, and its distance), we returned inside of our home.  about twenty minutes later we went outside of the north side of our house and observed another brighter object in the north sky with rapidly flashing red, green, and white light.  We then observed an object in the western sky that was a bright white light moving in short patterns.  To the sky directly above our house we observeda golden bright object, also moving in small movements independently.;42.4576877358494;-123.346973584905

Formation of lights moving erradically but within a defined area west by southwest of Grants Pass, OR;2010-09-04 22:10:00;10 minutes;Formation of lights moving erradically but within a defined area west by southwest of Grants Pass, OR I spotted a cluster of lights west of Murphy, OR, and expected to see the smooth, linear movements of a plane or helicopter but what I witnessed was completely different.  The object was moving in short, erratic bursts in several directions.  I asked two friends to come look at it and they saw the same thing. Through binoculars it seemed to have a bright central light with a circular cluster of  dimmer lights around it.  The object never seemed to move closer nor further away, staying in a seemingly small flight area. It would be stationary for a few seconds or less and then move in short, quick bursts up and down, left and right, even diagonally.  At one point I thought I saw a single light leave or drop from the object but it was faint and I'm therefore uncertain.  So far the object has been visible for twenty minutes.

Very bright light descends and travels southward shifting from yellow to red and fading from vision.;2013-04-28 21:26:00;1 minute;Very bright light descends and travels southward shifting from yellow to red and fading from vision. Event Occurrence:  Sunday April 28, 2013, approximately 9:25 PM PDT  Total Duration: Approximately 1 minute Terra  Location: Grants Pass, OR, USA Sky  Orientation: Observing Southerly Sky  Conditions: Clear, No clouds  I had stepped out back of my residence and had been there for a minute or two smoking a cigarette. Time: 0-5 seconds.  An unusually bright element at the top of my peripheral vision caught my attention, and I looked upward approaching 70 degrees of elevation. Time: 6-15 seconds.  The bright element’s apparent motion or change in relative sky position made it appear to be descending as the intensity of the brightness increased.  The color of light being emitted was initially brilliant yellow and was shifting to a yellow-orange.  Angle of elevation declining to 60 degrees. Time: 16-25 seconds.  As the color continued to become full orange and shifting to reddish-orange, the very bright element was slowly traversing the sky in what appeared to be a southerly direction.  Angle of elevation declined to 45 degrees. Time: 26-30 seconds. I took a few steps back along the patio, knocked of the glass door and motioned to my housemate to join me out back, and gestured toward the sky.  The element’s color was shifting to bright red by this time.  Angel of elevation declining to 35 degrees  Time: 31-40 seconds. The bright element maintained a bright red, retained a vertical angular elevation of approximately 30 degrees. Time: 41-50 seconds. The two of us then watch the bright element hang in the sky, potentially moving further away south from us, as the color shifted from bright red to brilliant but darker cherry red, though it was fading in intensity. Time: 51-60 seconds.  The two of us watched to element fade to nothing as the apparent sky location/direct progressed further south. All the movements of the element appeared to be slow, never jerking inconsistent or rapidly changing. There were no audio abnormalities or sounds that would be consistent with an airplane, helicopter or other known aerial object. Several mornings previously, before dawn, I had observed a meteor or fireball traverse the sky to my southeast, in a west to east direction, with a total duration of 2-3 seconds. The element that is the subject of this report, had no commonalities with a meteor or fireball.;42.4576877358494;-123.346973584905
