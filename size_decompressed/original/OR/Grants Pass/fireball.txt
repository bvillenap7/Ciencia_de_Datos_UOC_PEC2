The green fireball with barely a tail came between two trees on the land behind our home, and when it got about twenty feet from the ground it disappeared.  Like if someone turn it's light out. The object was green as in the color of a street light.  I didn't see any other color.  It hardly had a tail.  I was so surprised how close it came to the ground, and when it disappeared about twenty feet from the ground, it didn't blow up or nothing.  It just disappeared.  This was amazing, and scary at the same time.  Too close!  It came that close to hitting our house. Nothing was in the paper the next day.  No one else saw it, that I know of in this area.  I am a homemaker. ((NUFORC Note:  One of several reports from same source in Grants Pass.  PD));42.4576877358494;-123.346973584905
2 separate sightings July 4th 2010 of Orange fireball type objects moving slowly to the south in Southern Oregon area.;2010-07-04 22:30:00;30 minutes;2 separate sightings July 4th 2010 of Orange fireball type objects moving slowly to the south in Southern Oregon area. 1st sighting an orange object moving slowly across the sky in a straight pattern southward unknown altitude but much higher than mountains in the area seen for about a minute until disappearing. 2nd sighting same type of orange object moving southward looked to be trailing the first object approx. 20 minutes later seen for at least 2 minutes.  It appeared to me that before disappearing the color changed from orange to white. The same orange objects I seen have been posted on youtube from several others on the same night.;42.4576877358494;-123.346973584905

Reddish orange fiery ball moving away from the earth, could not send any text messages for up to an hour afterward.;2014-05-31 23:15:00;2 minutes;Redish orange fiery ball moving away from the earth, could not send any text messages for up to an hour afterward. At 11:15 pm my father in law called my wife and outside.  He was yelling about something in the sky.  My wife went out first because I was preoccupied.  Then my wife started yelling for me I thought something was wrong because of how she sounded.   I ran to the front yard ready to take care of who ever was causing problems.  My wife told me to look in the sky and I saw a huge redish orange ballon the sky.   At first I thought maybe a comet or something of that sort but then it started moving away from the earth towards space.  After it started moving it only a few seconds before it was completely out of sight.   I have always believed in extraterrestrial beings and have been studying the subject for close to a decade.  I have always hoped to be lucky enough to see something like this but never expected to really see it.   So far I have asked 20-30 people if they had seen anything in the sky last night but so far we are the only ones.  It's not a hoax,  I know what I saw, and it couldn't have been anything else.;42.4576877358494;-123.346973584905

Both, my husband and I, we woke up in the middle of night (2 AM).   We both saw an orange huge light ball sitting in the sky through our window (my husband walked out on to the deck).   The orange fireball was stationary, and got really bright deep orange with a hue of brown in it.  It never moved.    We watched it for about 2 minutes and then it gradually faded away.  It wasn't a moon, star, planet..it was something much bigger and it was nothing we have ever seen before.;42.4576877358494;-123.346973584905
