strange object seen in Grants Pass, Oregon;2008-07-13 20:35:00;3 minutes;strange object seen in Grants Pass, Oregon At about 20:30 hours on July 13, 2008, I was standing out side and was talking and looked up saw what I thought to an aircraft, as I looked on this did not look like and aircraft, it was to low and where I live, aircraft fly higher up.  As I watched the object move from north to south, I watched it and there seemed to be an aura or what looked to be a haze around it. The object was moving kind of slow, as I walked down the driveway to watch this object,  was when I noticed more the haze or aura around it. It seemed to all of a sudden disappear as I was watching it. When I walked back up the driveway, I looked up again and saw the same object moving in the same manner as I have described. I again walked down the driveway and watched the object and this time it had disappeared.  My friends are trying to tell me that perhaps I seeing a meteor or a comet these objects would have left a trail of some sort. I know what I  saw and in no way it was a meteor or a comet.
