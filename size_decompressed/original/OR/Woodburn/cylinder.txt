Cylinder-type very large ufo.;2014-10-13 14:30:00;17 minutes;Cylinder type very large ufo. I want you to know I do not do this.  This is my first time reporting a sighting and I am confused about what I saw.   On an October midday afternoon I was sitting on my deck and it was a somewhat warm day with some overcast.  Which was quite a comfortable afternoon for October (10-13-14).  I chose to sit in my chair outside with the dog and watch the clouds and I was watching  a military cargo  plane which the sound caught my attention  fly over my house and head south the clouds started breaking up, my eye caught a flash from a silver and blue object  which was right above the military cargo plane.  I was not sure I saw what I saw so I closed my eyes and blinked a few times,  when I was done and got focus again the object was still in same area south of my town Woodburn, Oregon.  This is all I am sending at this time after the  abusive comments  received in finding  a place to report. ((e-address deleted)) If I hear back fine if not I will destroy my drawing and hand letter  thank you for listing hopefully I can sleep now  please if this is laughed off  I wonâ€™t  file and other sighting or bother u again ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
