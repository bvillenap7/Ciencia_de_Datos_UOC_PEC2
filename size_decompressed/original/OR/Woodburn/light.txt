Bright light just west of Woodburn was seen for 30 minutes then was gone in a blink of an eye.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus?  PD));2007-02-28 19:12:00;19:40;Bright light just west of Woodburn was seen for 30 minutes then was gone in a blink of an eye On 2/28/07 around 7:12 pm I noticed a bright light in the sky above Woodburn.  I told two other people that our friends are back.  I decided to go outside to see if it was a plane heading towards us.  The bright light was about 30 stories high and maybe a half mile away (west of woodburn.)   The item was stationary in the sky.  I went back in side and asked the girls to come to the window.  We observed the bright light for about 30 minutes.  Durring this time my sister in law recieved a phone call and left the room. A few minutes later a neighbor went into his backyard and the bright light went away from and started to fade. As soon as the neighbor went back inside the bright light came back and was bright again. About 4 minuter later the object shot away from us and was gone.  It was gone in a blink of an eye. This bright light has been seen many times in the last two months in the same location. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Venus??  PD));45.1402;-122.861

Bright green glowing sphere shaped object that morphed as it flew over Woodburn, OR, neighborhoods;2018-05-22 20:45:00;40 seconds;Bright green glowing sphere shaped object that morphed as it flew over Woodburn, OR, neighborhoods I saw a bright green glowing sphere that morphed a bit and traveled low to the ground along the golf course and homes in my neighborhood. I was able to take some video footage of what I saw.  I was on my bicycle and I followed the object for about 5 minutes as I lost sight of it for awhile.  I rode my bike around the blocks in my neighborhood trying to regain sight of it again and ended up seeing it again hovering over some homes in my neighborhood.  It was right above my house at one point and then drifted over some other people's homes before I lost sight of it again.  This object had NO sound and NO one was piloting it and it was very bright green and it morphed slightly as it moved.  The color was bright green and the lighting was so amazing, unlike anything conventional I have ever seen before.  My phone's video camera doesn't do it much justice compared to what I saw in real life, but I am thankful I was able to get at least some partial video footage of what I witnessed, even though there is about 15 more seconds of activity that I observed before I was able to get to my cell phone camera.;45.1402;-122.861
