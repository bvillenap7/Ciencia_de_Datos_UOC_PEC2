I happened to see this enormous glow in the night sky, and assumed it was an illegal firework. When I realized that the shape was static,  I excaimed to my brother What is THAT?, he then turned around and watched it with me for about 2 seconds. I walked around his car to get a straight on view, but it had vanished. To give you an idea of the size, objects appearing on this horizon (the treetops I see are about one mile away) could be described this way: stars: a small bead planes: a marble local farm outdoor lights: a ping pong ball the glowing object: a soccer ball My brother, who is very opposed to ufo discussion and would have handily given any other explanation he could think of, had no idea what to make of it.;45.1402;-122.861
White ball of light falling to the ground;2005-11-23 00:45:00;5 seconds;White ball of light falling to the ground Driving Southbound on Interstate 5 just south of Woodburn, Oregon.  A bright light caught the corner of my eye to the left.  I turned to see a massive ball of white light falling toward the earth.  I first focused on it when it was at about 45 degrees from my position.  It fell to what appeared to be about 15 degrees and then was not visible.  I believe the mountain range to the East would have precluded it from being a celestial event since it was visible at such a low angle to the ground.  Additionally, it appeared to be no more than a few miles away.;45.1402;-122.861
