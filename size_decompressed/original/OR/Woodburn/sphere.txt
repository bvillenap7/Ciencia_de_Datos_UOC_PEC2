Cluster of small, flashing red lights high in the sky followed by spheres of bright light moving up/down near horizon;2020-08-03 23:30:00;~3 minutes;Cluster of small, flashing red lights high in the sky followed by spheres of bright light moving up/down near horizon August 3 2020.  This all happened during a power outage that affected 112 customers which began at  7:30pm and lasted until sometime after 2:00am. Around 11:30pm I first noticed a cluster of approx 15 small red lights rather high in the sky. Hard to judge altitude and distance at night.  From my viewing point they (or it) were about 10 o'clock high.  Some brighter than others. No discernible pattern or shape.  They maintained their positions and simultaneously flashed on and off at a rate of about once per second. This lasted for only a few seconds then went completely dark. I heard no sound. 30 seconds or so after this sighting, I saw a bright white spherical object moving erratically straight up and down not to far above the nearest treeline about 3/4 miles distant . The object looked to be between 2-5 miles away. At that distance it would measure at least 20 ft wide. It would shoot up above the nearest treeline and then shoot back down, sometimes higher or lower, but never so far down that I couldn't see it through the trees.  Nothing that I know of could possibly go as fast as this thing was going.  I never really saw it moving. It would be up in one instant and down in the next.  This lasted for about 6 or 7 seconds then went dark. Maybe 30 seconds later I saw the same object at about the same distance but much farther to my right.  Its behavior and duration was as I described for the first sighting.  I heard no sound at all.  I can't explain what is was, but it was NOT a helicopter, hot air balloon, fireworks, lightning, a reflection, meteor, comet, temperature inversion, or swamp gas.  The sky was cloud free and crystal clear.;45.1402;-122.861
