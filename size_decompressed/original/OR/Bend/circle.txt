Round silvery object  above city, possibly car size mylar balloon,seen from a few miles away slowly ascended till out of sight.;2000-11-11 17:30:00;2-3minutes;Round silvery object  above city, possibly car size mylar balloon,seen from a few miles away slowly ascended till out of sight. I was reviewing the recent reports on your site as I do every couple of weeks to see what is being supposedly seen. I just noted the sighting reported from Bend, Oregon and I need to chime in that I saw that and took two photos, yet to be developed. I was at the Pilot Butte Oregon State Park, which is a large conical volcanic cinder butte which has a road to the top and there were probably ten or twelve other folks up there then at the viewpoint overlooking Bend and vicinity..  My wife works at the nearby ((deleted)) and I had about 15 minutes to wait till I picked her up as she got off at 5P.M..  The place has a great view down to the city of Bend and you can also look over to the Three Sisters Mountains to the west about 25 miles. I had been watching the sunset going down over Mt. Bachelor south of the Three Sisters. There was a high thin cloud layer above the 10,000 foot summits of those mountains, and over Bend.. After a few minutes of watching the sunset I took a few minutes to walk over to the east side to look down on the side where I could see the building  below where my wife worked. The sunset was creating a great shadow of the Pilot Butte Cone which was stretching some length of miles across the flat land to the east of town. By chance I had my camera in my car and I took a photo of the long conical shadow, but because it was dimming light I thought to myself that the photo probably would'nt come out with much contrast or detail. As I walked back to my car on the west side of the overlook parking area I spotted this silver circle slowly rising to the west of Bend. I was looking down at it at first and it appeared to be several hundred feet above the ground already, but below my vantage point.  It looked like it might have risen from the forest area just west of the city limits.  My impression of it was that it was probably a large balloon, perhaps the size of a car, and probably three or four miles distant. My second impression was, is that a UFO? It deffinately appeared round and silver, but I did not see any lights or anything else of distinction on it. There was enough light left in the evening sky to see it pretty well and know that it was not a plane, copter, ultra light, hot air balloon or blimp. It was going very slowly up and drifting slightly north and east and coming for a time closer to my location as it ascended.. I felt this to be consistant with the light wind direction. I had seen a weather balloon launched just a few days before at the Salem, Oregon airport and it rose at a similar pace.  However it did not have that kinda inverted teardrop shape nor the hanging attachment of instruments like a weather balloon does. In that I had intended to photograph the great setting sun silhouette of the mountains, I went ahead and took two photos then with the circular object pretty much centered in the frame, just in case it was really a UFO..  By then the object had risen to about eye level and was above the tops of the distant mountains from my vantage point. I have not developed that roll of film yet, and at best it would probably appear no bigger on the print than this period>. unless enlarged. If it is helpful, I! can pro vide a copy of those photos when developed. Had I observed any thing more out of the ordinary, like unusual maneuvers, I would have rushed that unfinished roll of film to the developer. I noticed several of the other folks at the top of the Butte looking at the object but nobody appeared too excited so I just presumed it to be a balloon and that they probably did too. In that it was time for me to go and pick up my wife by then,I drove on down the spiraling road from the top. Several minutes had elapsed and the object kept slowly floating up toward the high clouds. I lost sight of it as I spiraled down the road, and when I could'nt spot it any longer I presumed it to have disappeared into the clouds. ((NUFORC Note:  Time indicated is approximate.  It is an estimate of when sunset would occur in that part of Oregon.  We spoke with the witness, and find him to be quite credible.  He holds a responsible job.

A round metallic object seen momentarily in the blue sky.;2004-03-17 14:00:00;A few seconds;A round metallic object seen momentarily in the blue sky. Well I am entering this in for a friend. She was heading north in her car and looked up and saw in the blue sky a shiny metallic looking object. It was round and moving in a straight path. She said it appeared to be large and far off in the distance. She wondered why she was seeing this and took her eyes off it... when she looked back up it was gone or had moved behind some trees.  Probably of no coincidence... she was also as the time just starting to have some emotional problems as she got dumped by her boyfriend. So she was in a different state of mind that what you would consider normal.;44.047234231806;-121.327826415094
Unusual Orange Orbs spotted over Bend, OR;2012-06-16 22:00:00;7 minutes;Unusual Orange Orbs spotted over Bend, OR Saw some strange lights in the sky tonight and just had to Google to see if there was an explanation.  Sounds like there are a lot of other people who have had similar experiences.  About 10pm tonight in Bend, OR, clear night, we came out of my parents home and our daughter said Momma, what's that in the sky???   My husband and I looked up to see a bright orange orb traveling through the sky (NE to SW) traveling at about a plane's pace.  Brighter than a plane would be and as it started to fade, I really paid attention. It had a light on it that was revolving around the outside until it finally disappeared. Never seen anything like it before.  We then started to drive and saw another one within a minute.  Stopped to watch and it, too, disappeared (traveling east to west). Didn't see the revolving light this time, however, it was not directly overhead as the first one had been.  Within 30 seconds, we spotted the 3rd orane orb coming from the south and trav! eling across the sky to the North, slightly west. What in the world are these things?  We were thinking maybe a new firework that has some amazing fading quality and can travel across the sky at the same height without falling before fading.  I also read about the chinese lanterns.  Not totally convinced, but maybe.  All three seemed to be traveling about the height of a local, lower flying plane and horizontally across the sky.  Can't wait to find out what they are!;44.047234231806;-121.327826415094
Two objects flying from the north headed south then disappeared;2012-12-30 00:00:00;4 minutes;Two objects flying from the north headed south then disappeared A friend and myself walked out of the front door of my house, and as he was leaving and he noticed an orange object coming across the sky from the north heading south,  it was snowing at the time and had cloud cover so it was below the clouds, this object continued south for a few miles then either went up through the clouds or disappeared.   Within a minute a second object continued on the same path as the first no sound, just bobbing back and forth a bit, same thing went to about the same spot and went up or disappeared.  My buddy and I waited for a few to see if this object or objects were going to come back, but nothing.;44.047234231806;-121.327826415094

The MOON changed Orbit from west to east.;2016-12-07 19:00:00;19:00-20:00;The MOON changed Orbit from west to east. On December 7th, 2016, I was driving west on Baker Rd. to my boyfriend's house, and noticed an object just to the right of the moon.  I lost sight after trees got in my line of view.   So, 15 minutes or so later, as I am driving east towards Hwy 97, I couldn't help but notice, THE MOON IN FRONT OF ME AGAIN.  In front of me while driving west and now, a few minutes later, it is in front of me again, but this time driving east...........I have to say, this really freaked me out.   Thanks for reading!
