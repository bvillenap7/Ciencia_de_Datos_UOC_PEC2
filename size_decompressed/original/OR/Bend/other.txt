Large fleet of lights flying together in unity across the sky over Bend Oregon;2016-12-18 20:40:00;1 minute;Large fleet of lights flying together in unity across the sky over Bend Oregon Spotted in the sky from the far north at 8:40 pm pacific standard time on Dec 18,  2016, several witnesses viewed what looked like bright white dots, very high, possibly 30-40 thousand AGL, moving in formation of what appeared to be a “Sickle” or half moon, in unison, at a very high rate of speed from the far North to the far South.  No noise at all.   Event took approximately 30-45 sec across a clear sky for around 30 miles until disappeared (unobserved) until objects were completely out of sight.   The objects were star sized and it was definitely a fleet formation the thing that was apparent was that they moved together flawlessly spaced apart.  There was no sharp moves just a straight over flight moving extremely fast.  The Picture below is still to much like a V but the flight pater was like a cycle or half moon and moving in unity spaced equally apart.   No smoke trails, no noise, blinking light, just white lights about the size of stars flying fast.  The sky! was clear.;44.047234231806;-121.327826415094

A few seconds later, the object emerged on the other side of the tree and looked like black balloons floating in the air.  As the object moved from the northwest to the southeast, I noticed it traveled at a consistent altitude and made no noise.  It did not float up or move with the wind like balloons.  It did not make a buzzing sound like a drone. I pointed the object out to my spouse and snapped 4 photos. The object consisted of four black spheres that seemed connected.;44.047234231806;-121.327826415094
We are missing 5-7 hours of time and my foot is now injured, and bruises all are healed from acute pancreatitis;2020-12-08 23:00:00;6-7 hours;We are missing 5-7 hours of time and my foot is now injured, and bruises all are healed from acute pancreatitis Missing time.  Last night Brandon and I finished playing a game of chess and we’re going to go to the store.  We got dressed and left at what I thought was around 11:00 pm. We drove down the hill and when we got to the store it was already closed. We were a little taken back because it was supposed to be open.  We elected to go to the gas station for some beer and a pizza. When we went inside the attendant said “good morning, what are you guys doing here so early?” We were both like, uh, okay and we went to grab a 6 pack of beer but the doors were all locked and Bran says, what’s up, why are these locked? The attendant said it’s 6:00 in the morning.  We got a pizza and went back up the hill.  We are completely baffled! Where did 7 hours go? We went to bed and literally slept until 6am the next day, which is today. I woke up to go to the bathroom and I about fell down in pain. It feels like I have a broken foot. I didn’t injure myself, it’s just I’m a ton of pain and can’t walk on it.  I have this huge feeling of anxiety. My hubby who is a scientist isn’t really a believer accept for the fact that the universe is vast and probably has some life in it.  We can NOT remember where 7 hours went. I don’t have any recollection of being abducted or anything like that but for two of us to have experienced this is just mind blowing and completely confusing. It should be Monday, it’s Tuesday. We went to the store Sunday night, it should be Monday. Can anybody point me in a direction that I may be able to learn about what happened with us? I’ve researched a little and it seems it’s a phenomenon of alien abductions...;44.047234231806;-121.327826415094
