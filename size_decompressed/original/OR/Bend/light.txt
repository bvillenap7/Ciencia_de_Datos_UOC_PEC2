Red pulsating  orb over the center of Bend, Oregon.  Multiple witness reports to 911.;2000-11-11 17:05:00;25 minutes;Red pulsating  orb over the center of Bend, Oregon.  Multiple witness reports to 911. I had just left work when I noticed a bright red object moving very slowly over the center of Bend.  I at first thought was only an airplane, but after driving the few blocks to my house and parking I got out to find it hovering possibly 1000 feet above and to the east of my house.  It was a bright red circular or possibly disc shaped craft, with what appeared to be a smaller red light that seemed to revolve around the center of it (it almost appeared seperate from the larger shape at times). I asked a man coming out of a store to look at it and then I went into the store and had a young woman who works there, and another man come out to view it.  I then called the Bend Police Department's 911 line and reported it, and asked if they had any other reports of it, they said they did. My roommate then came home, and I had him look at it also.  We had a sighting a couple of years back that we also reported on this database, and this craft slowly dissappeared in the general direction as that one did, towards the now infamous cattle mutilation site of Sandy Springs to the south east of Bend.  We only just saw this thing, so I'm going to call the Redmond airport and see if they have any information (I tried contacting the local newspaper but they were closed).  My roommate took a photo of it.  Right over the center of our town.  Wow. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length with this witness, and found him to be exceptionally convincing.  He has pursued facts surrounding the incident, to the extend of contacting the local news media, police, etc..  He appeared on a major radio program with me and did an excellent job of describing what he had seen.  PD));44.047234231806;-121.327826415094

Extremely bright light over Mt. Bachelor.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly Venus??  PD));2005-07-13 21:45:00;15 minutes;Extremely bright light over Mt. Bachelor My husband and I saw a very bright light over Mt. Bachelor.  I thought it might be Venus, but I looked up the star chart and found Venus, and it was much dimmer.   This was so bright that it looked like a morphing bright light- it sort of changed shape and color, and we watched it as it set behind the mountain.  It was extremely bright, and was in the NW horizon.   I'm skeptical about UFO's, and I have a bachelors degree. ((NUFORC Note:  Currently, Venus is visible in the evening western sky, and it is very bright.  We believe that it would have to be ruled out, before we could conclude that the witness saw something dramatic that was not Venus.  PD));44.047234231806;-121.327826415094

It moved horizontally very slowly above the trees.  I watched it for 3 minutes then proceeded to grab my keys, wallet, and camera with the intention of driving over to it  to get some pictures. I came back to the window to check its position before leaving  only moments later, and it was gone.;44.047234231806;-121.327826415094
Lighted circular object over Bend, Oregon.;2010-12-16 16:00:00;30 seconds;Lighted circular object over Bend, Oregon. I was with my mom, driving home. I was in the passenger seat and was trying to locate the moon through the windshield. I saw a ball of light moving at a medium speed for a short period of time before it disappeared into clouds. My mom saw it too, because she then asked Did you just see that?. I don't think it was a plane, because planes aren't lit up like that. It could have been a satellite, but it was moving too fast to be any normal one that I've seen. It looked like a shooting star almost, but without the trail, and without the speed of one.

Eight bright red lights in the sky.;2013-11-24 22:00:00;7-10 minutes;On 11/24/13, at 10pm, I was walking my dog to an empty lot near my house, where my dog takes his breaks.  It was a very clear night, and I was looking at the stars as I walked.  My attention went to my dog for a minute or two when we reached the empty lot, and then I glanced back up at the sky.  Upon looking up at the sky, I was somewhat taken back by the amount of bright lights in the sky.  It took me a minute to try to interpret what I was looking at, because there was no easy explanation for what it could be.  There were at least eight bright red lights in the sky. The bright red lights were at a 45º angle to the West of me.  They were well above the mountains, so I knew that it was not any structure.  Additionally, the lights were not moving in relation to each other, nor were they moving in unison.  They were very bright red lights that suddenly appeared, and were remaining motionless in the sky.  There may have been more than eight, but when I got over the surprise of seeing them and began to count, there were eight.  Right after I counted the lights, one of the two top most lights, dimmed slightly, then came back to its original brightness, and then went out.  For a moment, there seemed to be a very dim white light where the red light had been… then nothing. I ran back to my house, about a half block away, and looked for my binoculars.  By the time I found them and ran out to the back of my house, there were only five lights left in the sky.  In looking at them through the binoculars, I could still only see the lights, rather than what they were attached to.  My girlfriend quickly put on warm clothing to go outside, and by the time she got out there, she was able to see two of the lights that were left.  I then decided to try to video record the lights, and ran back into my house for the camera.  By the time I got back with the camera, all of the lights were gone. Within minutes, I called the non-emergency police number asking if anyone else had seen, and reported, the lights.  While still on the phone with the dispatcher, a police officer called me asking what I had seen.  The officer told me that a woman across town had also seen the lights, and had also gotten pictures and video of them.  He said that what the other witness had seen, were five “copper colored” lights in the sky. After talking with the police, my girlfriend and I went back out to the vacant lot to see if there were any more lights in the sky.  There were no more unusual lights, but there were several jets in the sky going back and forth in the area that the bright red lights had been in.  I spoke to another police officer the next morning, and he told me that he had seen two military jets flying together in that area of the sky that morning. This is the approximate positions of the bright red lights, in relation to themselves, that I saw: *   *   *    * *   *    *    *  They all seemed to be paired up, with a uniform distance between them, with the exception that one of the four in the middle group was a little farther away from its “wing man”.  The lights began disappearing from the top down, and within a few minutes of the last bright red light disappearing, there were jets in the sky going back and forth.  From the time I first saw the lights, to when the last one disappeared, was about seven to ten minutes.  I am presently attempting to contact the other witness in order to triangulate, to determine the distance and location of the lights.  It appeared that they were over a wilderness area, which I would like to investigate. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he seemed to us to be exceptionally serious-minded.  We suspect that he is an unusually good witness.  PD));44.047234231806;-121.327826415094

Definitely not a plane or a meteor or a satellite. My husband and I were in the hot tub and he noticed a bright white light moving up in a diagonal direction in the sky north of us.  We watched it carefully because it wasn't flashing like a plane would.  It was perfectly white and was moving in a steady pattern.  We were saying, What is that?  It's not a plane because it's not flashing, it's not a satellite because it's too bright, it's not a meteor because it's moving up in the sky... then it dimmed and completely disappeared into a perfectly cloudless, black sky.  We watched the sky in that area for some time and it didn't reappear at all.  I got online to see if others have seen the same thing... it sounds like some of the things others have indeed seen lately.;44.047234231806;-121.327826415094

Then I saw another light appear from behind the trees following in the same trajectory as the first one I saw. They just kept coming. There were at least thirty if not more. Sometimes they travelled in pairs side by side but all travelled in the same line. There may have been more that preceded the ones I saw but I can only vouch for the ones I saw when I first looked up at the sky. I watched until no more passed by.
