Oval (football shaped) with gridwork.;1980-02-18 18:30:00;Unknown;Oval(football shaped) with gridwork It was my birthday, and we were driving home....since I was an ametuer astronomer, I was crawling around the car looking out the car looking at the sky it was not right...  My mom stopped the car and I looked up at. Craft that looked like a football with a gridwork pattern.   The next thing I remember, it .was the next morning, and my birthday cake was sitting out the next morning..definately not a typical birthday;44.047234231806;-121.327826415094

I said it's a bright star My Neighbor said watch for a few seconds and that's when it started moving around the sky in a side/up movement, paused then moved straight down and then strait up. When the craft stopped moving we noticed small bright drops falling from the craft every two seconds if I remember it was about four of them.  At this time we woke up two other households. They witnessed the same movement we saw earlier with the up and down side to side. Before the craft vanished it turned a bright orange color and then vanished.  I saw the same thing a few months later in Sunriver Oregon on New Years Eve working the late shift.  about five minutes after 12:00am in the NW part of the sky, the same location the first sighting was seen I noticed a star that should not have been where this was.  I radio'd other people working Want to see a UFO!  Most on the evening shift came running out and saw what seemed to be a UFO. A small group of the bar croud whitnessed the same thing.  A bright object moving sporadically then dropping small bright lights out every two seconds, turned orange then vanished.  This lasted about 10m minutes after we first sighted the craft.  The final UFO sighting was in the summer of '07.  I had to respond to an alarm at one of the golf courses at approx. 1:00 AM.  I showed up the same time as the local police, we checked over the club house to find a false alarm.  As we were wrapping thing up I saw a very fast moving bright light moving from West to East and asked the officers What do you think that is?  She said a satalite, Jet, and by this time it had moved from the Cascades to Easten Oregon and the final response! Don't know.  I'd like to know if anyone else has seen these objects during these time frames.  Warmest Regards Central Oregon Sightings;44.047234231806;-121.327826415094

I later found this u-tube video filmed on the same date by someone else who lives in Bend, Oregon.  The event I saw looked exactly like the one in the video however, when I witnessed it there were two lights that eventually disappeared upward.  I saw on your website that there have been numerous reportings of these &quotfireballs&quot and that you were still trying to solve the mystery so thought this might be helpful.;44.047234231806;-121.327826415094
Oval shaped crafted with three colored lights.;2015-10-09 20:00:00;1 hour;Oval shaped crafted with three colored lights. Small craft seen once before was sighted again tonight. It is an oval shaped craft that pulsates light.  There are three colors that accompany this craft: White, Green, and Red. Craft moved very slowly across the sky.  Would pause, move up or down, and then continue in it's original path.  Instances would occur in which the craft would blip out of sight, only to reappear a moment later. A second craft was spotted to it's east.  This craft hovered low, and had two orange lights placed on the bottom of the craft.  When I began to approach the direction in which it was hovering, it began to move.  It went off in the direction of the smaller craft, before disappearing. The smaller craft seemed to have been moving in the direction of the lager, lower hovering craft for the full event.  To my knowledge, the smaller craft is still outside as I speak. A high flying plane was spotted, when I returned outside for a second time.  It has been circling around the town near the craft.

From my perspective it was in my Northeast direction then moved slightly Northwest with in the hour.  It was so small I had to get my binoculars.  It was oval with lights around the edge and slightly grey in the middle.  The west side of object looked brighter since it was facing the sun.  I would not have noticed it accept there was a much lower flying helicopter that past under the position of the object.   At least 2 airliners and the helicopter had passed by at different altitudes and times which gave me the perspective of great distant.  I also went and got my roommate and she brought her binoculars out and saw it too.  Since that day...I went outside at the same time Thursday, Friday and tonight to see if maybe this was a star.  It was not!  No object was in sight since then.  I wish I could have taken a picture.  My phone camera could not pic up the object.;44.047234231806;-121.327826415094
