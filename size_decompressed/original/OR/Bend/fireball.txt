On my right hand side a bright green fireball soared through the sky.  ((anonymous report));2015-08-03 23:00:00;10 seconds;I was driving along the Cascade lakes highway late at night last summer when on my right hand side a bright green fireball soared through the sky.  I watched as it passed behind the Sisters mountain range and then behind Broken top. It was a really big size.  The fact it was the size it was made it feel close but the fact it actually flew behind the mountain range made me realize it was far away just really big.   I've thought about that night hundreds of times since seeing that, and only recently became aware that others in the world have seen green fireball ufos.

I walked outside tonight when my boyfriend called for me to come see a strange light from the perspective of our front driveway.;2015-10-29 20:13:00;5 minutes;I walked outside tonight when my boyfriend called for me to come see a strange light from the perspective of our front driveway.  I saw a bright glowing saturated orange orb hover in the night sky.   At first, I thought it might be a planet (like Mars), but then I realized it was hovering, actually moving smoothly (intentionally) horizontally and vertically, was much larger and saturated in color than a planet would be.   Also, the light was glowing from within -- it wasn't directional or a beam of light, so it didn't look like a small aircraft or a drone.  And it didn't have any blinking lights on it.  It looked like a bright orange fireball that was somewhat stationary, but moving very intentionally at times.  I was in awe of this glowing ball and overwhelmed. It finally glowed really bright and flickered once, became instantly smaller, and then faded out to a small dot and disappeared as if it had quickly zoomed away.  We tried to capture it on our iPad and iphone, with one poor quality image to show for it.;44.047234231806;-121.327826415094
Fireball flies over Bend, Oregon.;2015-11-22 22:15:00;5 minutes;Fireball flies over Bend Oregon We were upstairs when we noticed a orange & yellow fireball like shape flying somewhat slowly from south to north.  It wasn't large, much smaller than a plane or helicopter but bigger than must drones.  Light was not exterior, it glowed from within and was flying fairly low, perhaps 150 - 200 feet above the tallest trees in our area. We watched until it disappeared, about 5 minutes or so, never seen anything like it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
