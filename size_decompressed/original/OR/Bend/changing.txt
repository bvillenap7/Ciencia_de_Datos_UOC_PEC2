Very bright orange sphere  turns to 2 spheres and dissapears;2011-10-29 19:07:00;10 seconds;Very bright orange sphere  turns to 2 spheres and dissapears Both of my parents and I were driving on highway 20 between Bend Oregon and burns Oregon headed east and at milepost 67 we observed a bright orange/copper sphere in the night sky.  It was there for about 3 seconds and then disappering and reappearing as two orange/copper lights even brighter than the first time.   I have seen these exact type and color of lights in harney county multiple times and have seen them appear as huge orange balls that went into each other and then shooting out into 4 to 2 to 5 balls and then dissapearing and reappearing in a fifteenth part of the sky.   Everytime these lights look and act the same.;44.047234231806;-121.327826415094
Like lights over phoenix, az;2011-12-21 18:00:00;15-20 minutes;Like lights over phoenix, az On 12-21-11 I was visiting with some friends on their rural property about 3 miles east of town in Bend, OR.  I was inside the house waiting for my 3 friends as they were on the front porch smoking.   My 1 friend ran in the house and said &quotthe lights are back, you gotta see this.&quot   I ran out to the driveway and looked up....could not believe what I was looking at.  I was looking at 5 large red orb lights moving in formation very slowly south to north toward the Bend Airport.  The lights were about 500 feet over us and just south of us by maybe 1000 feet.  this was a very close up view and I kept thinking OMG, it's like a mothership out of Star Wars.  The night was very dark and clear, new moon.  I could not see an outline of an aircraft, just large red orb lights about 100 feet or so aprt, in formation or perhaps attached together as one large craft.  I believe it was one large craft, as they were totally syncronized.  The lights moved north toward ! the airport at probably 20 mph or so, then made a 90 degree turn east and moved out into the desert.  We watched for about 15-20 minutes, until they were so far out, we didnt have as good a view.  As the lights turned east, the lights went from one long 5 light row, to intermittent blinking and triangular formations, with up to 8 or 10 lights.  The night was calm, no wind at all.  The night was so quiet, you could hear a pin drop and this craft was silent.  The distance from side to side of the lights was hundreds of  feet wide.  The same friends have seen these lights on several ocassions and have had numerous sightings, day and night in this area for many years and have seen massive motherships (for lack of a better description) in broad daylight.  From reading other reports, I know others are seeing the same lights.....  I am a Christian KJV AV1611 Bible believer and do not pay too much mind to this sort of thing, but know exactly what I saw and it is not like anything I! have ever seen before and nothing like this is know to exist ! publicly ... the lights looked just like the famous &quotlights over phoenix, AZ, which have been dismissed as weather balloons.  Rest assured, these were no weather balloons and neither were the lights over Phoenix..... As I said, it was so dark, we could not see an outline of a craft, just felt like the lights were attached to one and it was like nothing know to man, more like sci-fi stuff.... enormous!!!  I do not wish to be contacted, but just want to share my experience, as I see others are witnessing the same.
