Bright round object seen at night, shot upward at a 45% angle, then got dimmer and dimmer until it faded away.;1980-08-15 20:00:00;10 minutes;Bright round object seen at night, shot upward at a 45% angle, then got dimmer and dimmer until it faded away. My husband and I were travelling north at about 8 p.m. in our car at night and were starting to descend into Bend, OR.  I saw a round, bright light in the sky.  All of a sudden, the object shot upward, but not in a straight line. It shot at a 45% angle to the right.  My husband was asleep, but I woke him up.  He saw it too.  The object started to get dimmer and dimmer, then a cloud came over it and we could no longer see it.  We don't know if it faded out completely, or if the cloud was just not allowing us to see it anymore.  It really shook me up.  My husband, also commented that what we saw was very strange, not like what an airplane would look like in the sky at night.  I remember stopping to get a cup of coffee, in Bend, before continuing on our journey to the Oregon Crater, located to the east of Bend.

here is the story behind the picture..I live in Oregon and as always for the last few months it has been cold and overcast if not snowi;2004-02-05 13:59:00;not  know;here is the story behind the picture..I live in Oregon and as always for the last few months it has been cold and overcast if not snowing  The picture was taken on a overcast day with temp in the high 30s..the camera is a Olympus  C 3000 not a cheapy by any means i have been takeing pictures for many years and i know a lens flair when I see one...In the bushes you will see alittle grey and white cat she lives in my shop(i work on cars for a hobby) and i had taken a picture of a truck i was working on... So I seen her in the bushes and thought well why not take one of her.................  I was only looking at her when the picture was taken and did not notice what she was watching only that she was looking up  after loading the picture on the computer did i see what the cat was watching..She is looking right at it when I looked at it harder i noticed what seem to be a aura of heat around it and also the beam of light to the left of the picture......the picture was taken 2/15/04 at 1:59 pm....any thoughts??????????  I just want to know what it is ((NUFORC Note:  The photo looks interesting to us, but we turned to a professional photographer, requesting his opinion.  The photographer is retired from the aerospace industry, where he worked as a photographer and (computer) artist.   ((BEGIN COPIED MESSAGE FROM PHOTOGRAPHER)) Peter, This seems to be an artifact of the camera or film. (film flaw or perhaps a bit of static electricity in a digital camera) Something that bright would show purple or violet on surrounding bushes etc. I would expect violet highlights on the white cat or the snow for example. I don't see them.  The other thing it might be is something on the branch that focuses the light like a prism there seems to be another bright spot just below the cat maybe the same color. but it seems to me to have happened after the image was captured.  With a digital camera in cold weather there is sometimes a static electric charge that makes interesting effects.  so there are my thoughts Ray-Paul ((END COMMENT)) ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Ray-Paul Nielsen, Brier, WA, for supplying us with the opinion.

Pulsing, rotating red and green lights with flashes of white light in NE sky every night.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sirius??  PD));2011-09-25 21:00:00;unknown;Pulsing, rotating red and green lights with flashes of white light in NE sky every night One object, seen for nine months, appeared to be high altitude in the NW sky, after sunset.  It looked round in shape with red and green pulsating, possibly rotating lights with flashes of white light angled down at 45 degrees. One witness has been watching since December of 2010.   For months, it stayed stationary in the sky.  In the last few weeks, it started slowly moving each night to the NW. She was reluctant to tell anyone until someone else mentioned seeing it. Another witness saw it for the first time about two weeks ago.  The first night she saw it, about 9:00 pm, a small plane from the East appeared to fly towards it, than made a U turn away from the object. The other two witnesses, both seeing the lights in the last two weeks, saw the same things. ((NUFORC Note:  Sirius??  PD));44.047234231806;-121.327826415094
White light crosses sky, turns, then appears to hover before fading out.;2016-08-13 22:00:00;5 minutes;White light crosses sky, turns, then appears to hover before fading out. As I went out of my apartment, I saw a massive white light in the sky moving at a good speed N N/E.  After just a few seconds I had the thought, I can't think of anything that could possibly be besides the international space station.  Well, unless it was a UFO. (Haha) IMMEDIATELY after the second half of that thought passed through my head...  The light veered east. &#128530 it got to a point far north and a bit east of Bend, then stopped. &#128530  This light was VERY bright it was just a few degrees off of a street lamp and still was clearly definable.  It just stopped moving altogether and sat there for a few minutes slowly dimming until I couldn't make it out anymore. The next day I noted that the point at which it had come to rest was approximately the peak of Black Butte.;44.047234231806;-121.327826415094
I've never been a believer, but maybeâ€¦  ((Starlink satellites));2020-04-10 21:38:00;30 min;I've never been a believer, but maybe... I saw what I at first thought were two satelites crossing paths which struck me as interesting.  Then I noticed another following in what seemed to be the same path as one of the other ones. Well it wasn't over I counted up to 15 on the exact same course!  They seemed to be spaced evenly apart.  The last one I saw came about 3 or 4 minutes later and seemed to be slightly off course of the others. My neighbor drove in and showed him what I was seeing and he saw what I saw. I have been a star gazer all my life and I have seen many things in the sky, but nothing I couldn't explain. I have seen thousands of satelites in my life starting with Sputnick when I was a child. These weren't satelites.;44.047234231806;-121.327826415094
