Observed a disk-shaped object completing unbelievable maneuvers to the SE above the city of Bend, Oregon. Object hovered, did split sec;1998-11-12 02:00:00;5-10 minutes;Observed a disk-shaped object completing unbelievable maneuvers to the SE above the city of Bend, Oregon. Object hovered, did split second U-turns, appeared to be 'playing,' or 'dancing.' There was no sound emitted. The only light from the craft seemed to be reflected from the moon. Object when first sighted was moving towards the west. On the night of November 12, in Bend, Oregon, I was outside of my home observing the moon and the planets currently visible. My roommate had asked that if they were at all visible to let him know (it has been overcast alot here lately). It was clear. I went in and we both came out. I was pointing out a neighborhood light that was in violation of an Oregon code because it was not subdued (any amateur astronomer can relate,) when he pointed to an object in the sky and asked me what it was. I first saw the object heading due west and was about to say it must be an airliner when I saw it do an unbelievable U-turn. Astonished, we both watched this 'craft' do maneuvers that would be impossible for any known aircraft to perform. I am a veteran, and used to work while A-10's and a variety of other aircraft flew overhead. What we saw seemed to be so unhindered by gravity that I can only describe it's behavior as playful, like it was 'dancing' in the air. It performed multiple U-turns, and would accelerate to incredible speeds and then come to a complete halt in what seemed milliseconds. It made absolutely no sound at all. I would estimate it's distance from us to be anywhere from one to three miles away, and it's size as possibly quite large. I did see a very distinct 'disk' shape. The thing eventually seemed to vanish, and we remained outside for about another hour watching for it before we gave up and went inside. I am an Archaeology student, my roommate is a Geologist. We are both well grounded in science and the tradition that believes empirical data adds to the human understanding of ourselves and our surroundings. If this comes off sounding like a disclaimer let me just add that our 'data' goes against everything we have been tought to believe. I did not want, nor wish, to see such a thing. Nevertheless, I, we, saw the damned thing. For myself it calls too much into question. But there it is.;44.047234231806;-121.327826415094
A single, stationary fairly large saucer/disc with rotating lights that changed colors from red to green, blue and white that hovered f;2003-01-28 02:00:00;15 minutes;A single, stationary fairly large saucer/disc with rotating lights that changed colors from red to green, blue and white that hovered f Object was seen at 2:00 a.m. 01-28-03 in the southwest skies over Bend, Oregon, USA.  It appeared to be located approximately in the direction of Mount Bachelor.  We watched it for 15 minutes until it dropped below the rooftop line of our neighbors house. There was one single disc/saucer type object observed that was stationary for the fifteen minutes we watched it. Skies were clear.  It was staionary although it was dropping some in altitude to eventually dropped below our neighbor's roof top which was our viewing area and certainly moving away from us as the vision got smaller in that fifteen minute period.  It was as if it was going sideways as it did get smaller and did drop in altitude a little, but appeared stationary at the same time. It was fairly large as seen at a distance,(hard to determine how far away it was) had a rotating outter circle of lights all the way around the saucer and the lights would change colors from green, to all red, to all blue and to all white.  Most of time, I observed more all red, or all green and these light rotated the whole time.  I was thinking to myself, just like they make it seem in real life or in the movies. We had time to get our glasses and also binoculars to take a better look.  With the binoculars it was strange to only to be able to see a white undefined mass.  Kind of like a thin white mass/cloud-like in the darness.  I thought that was strange. Obviously you could see it with the naked eye, but there was some sort of field that made it unobservable while trying to use another type of viewing apparatus. Thought about taking a picture of it, but didn't.  Glad there were two of us that viewed it, so there is no question that we saw what we saw. After it dropped below the rooftop line of our neighbor's house, we didn't pursure it any more.  As far as backgrounds of the observers - I am 49 years old and a professional by occupation.  The other observer is a 20 yead old college student who was home from school for a few days, and had been studying late.  He originally spooted the thing and brought it to my attention.  Interesting, yet kind of scary. I never believed in those things before, but I certainly have to change my stance on them now.  Either that, or our own government is experimenting with some type of contraption in the wee hours of the morning when they knew most people would be asleep. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  The object seems inconsistent with a celestial body, since a star or planet in the southwest sky would appear to rise as the Earth rotates to the east.  However, the star, Sirius, which is very vivid during the winter months, would be in the southern sky at 0200 hrs..  We do not know what the witnesses observed.

Silver disk over Oregon;2010-05-02 16:00:00;2 minutes;Silver disk over Oregon I was with my friend on her front porch, with a clear view of the sky.  It was a semi-cloudy day, and we noticed a silver disk moving across the sky, very quickly. It was making a very unusual sound, which I can't describe very well.  We ran inside to get her mom, but by the time we made it back outside, it had disappeared.   We were very unsure of what it was, but were definitely sure it was not a plane or jet.   At the time we saw it, we had her radio playing, but when it appeared, the radio stopped playing, even though it was plugged in.

These are the accounts of our UFO sighting on Wednesday May 14, 2014 at approximately 8:00 PM in Bend Oregon. I am an Alternative and Holistic Healthcare Practitioner and my Husband is a Data Base Developer for a University. We have never had a UFO encounter of any kind. My Husband and I were driving South bound on the Bend Parkway.  The sun was getting close to setting and the skies were clear and beautiful.  Suddenly we both saw a large, reflective, oval, disk-shaped object appear in the sky with a fuzzy haze around it.  It looked like it was flying on the south end of town between the Bend and Sun River area, perhaps near China Hat Road.   The disk appeared smaller than a plane but the shape and the brightness of the reflective material was what really caught our eyes.  It was also moving very fast and we were both astonished because weâ€™d never seen anything of that shape or speed in the skies before.  It lasted for about 10 seconds and then suddenly disappeared completely!  This is when we got pretty excited.   We were both exclaiming with astonishment when about 4-5 seconds later, it reappeared!  This time travelling much faster and lasting approximately 7-8 seconds before completely disappearing again.  It was amazing;44.047234231806;-121.327826415094
