Oregon UFO Review Case:  Triangle craft decends to ground level.;2002-07-07 00:15:00;1 1/2 hour;Triangle craft decends to ground level. On Sunday night a call came into the OUFOR Hotline regarding the following sighting which happened just after midnight of the same day. The witness got home from work late Saturday night at about 10:30. After showering and eating a bite he decided to go out on the back deck of his house and watch the stars. He writes...I was watching for falling stars when I noticed a star that was fluctuating in brightness. All of a sudden I saw the star move slightly. That really got my attention. I kept watching and the star move, side to side and then up. I got my binoculars out to get a better look and when I found the star, I noticed a hazy object above the star that had a blinking red light above it (it was 12:15 a.m. by this time). These two objects moved together with the lower object seeming to sway almost like they were connected, but they were clearly separate. I then called the police to see if anyone else had seen this and they said there were no reports. I then woke up my son and made him look since I was having a hard time believing what I was seeing. I watched these objects move around for a while (it's now 12:45 a.m.) parallel to the first star I saw. It was moving at the same time and in the same direction that the other two objects were moving. About a half hour later they appeared to get closer. I could make out the shape of the object that had a red light on it. It was a triangle shape. And the movements of these objects were getting more erratic and moving further distances from side to side, then up, then down, etc. About 1:30 a.m. I thought it was time to get to bed. On my way through the house I decided to step out front to see if it was still there. The objects were still there and after watching for about 10 minutes the objects descended rapidly... So fast that I was alarmed and ran for the door to the house. The two lower lights that were some distance from the triangle disappeared first behind the tree. Then the triangle continued down and I could see it was black. The red light on it wasn't lit. Then it disappeared and I was waiting to hear a crash but it never happened. They had to have either landed or crashed. When the black triangle went down it looked to be about a mile or two away. At this point I was in a state of shock and sat in my front room for about 10 minutes and went to bed. OUFOR contacted the Bend police department and confirmed that this witness had called. No other sightings have been reported to them within the 24 hours since the sighting. A preliminary investigation has been opened and OUFOR investigator John LaBossiere of Bend has taken on the investigation. He has talked with the witness and is attempting to better verify where this craft appeared to have come down. We will post any future information that comes out of this investigation.;44.047234231806;-121.327826415094
Triangle object and accompanying lights descend rapidly from sky;2002-07-07 01:00:00;2 hours;Triangle object and accompanying lights descend rapidly from sky I noticed a star in the sky acting strangely and fluctuating dramatically in brightness. It was slightly moving back and forth. I got my binoculars and when I looked at the star I noticed there was a triangular object above it. The object had a red light on it's tip that seemed to be moving around. Both objects moved at the same time and in the same direction. The objects were probably 20-30,000 feet in the air at least. I watched it for about an hour moving erratically and at one point seemed to shoot a streak of light from it's tail end.That was when I noticed what I thought was a reddish star move at the same time these objects were moving. This 3rd object was straight across from the bright white light below the triangle object and a great distance from them. This is when I realized this was an unexplainable object. As a little time went on they were getting closer. And then all of the sudden it descended at a rapid pace. It got to what looked about 2 miles away and the red light stopped and it was a very large black triangle with the lights below it. It then dissapeared from view behind some trees. When it dissapeared I thought it was crashing but there was no noise. I called the local police but they reported no other reports.;44.047234231806;-121.327826415094

I possess a Bachelor of Science degree with  minors in Speech Communication and Physical Education and Health from Eastern Oregon University. While on a routine road patrol 18 miles east of my home town of Bend, Oregon, I saw a black triangle with no lights cross US Highway 20 in front of me. This highway connects Bend with eastern Oregon (Burns) and western Idaho.  I stopped my state vehicle, turned off the lights and the engine, stepped outside and stood on the shoulder of the highway. The sky was perfectly clear, with an almost perfect full moon, lots of light in the sky.  The object passed over the top of me as I stood outside of my vehicle. The object was totally and completely silent, no noise whatsoever, and no lights to speak of at all.  I have shared this with only my wife and several co-workers simply by virtue of this being the first time anything like this has ever happened to me.   Unfortunately, I was alone during the occurrence I have no way of proving anything, but, I know what I saw and have no reason to fabricate a story such as this, since I am a skeptic.;44.047234231806;-121.327826415094
Bend Oregon has sighting of UFO on Friday September 10th at 10 pm.;2010-09-10 22:00:00;5 minutes;B end Oregon has sighting of UFO on Friday September 10th at 10 pm. Object entered field of vision from north at rapid rate of speed.  Object stopped without slowing down and abruptly changed directions, accelerating instantanouesly and traveling in the opposite direction, instantanously stopping and accelerating again at speeds beyond the laws of physics, then stopping again without slowing down and performing a number of gravity defying manoverours.  Then it propelled out of site, again without noise or the appearance of acceleration or deacceleration.  The object displayed bright white lights in the form of a triangle with non-blinking red lights on what appeared to be short wings.   Three of us observed the object and concluded based upon our combined experience that what we saw was not something manmade, obviously a UFO.  Since we have been examining the night sky for a repeat performance, but we agree it was probably a once in a lifetime event.;44.047234231806;-121.327826415094
Triangular shaped object with moving lights moving in side to side motion before disappearing.;2014-02-21 19:10:00;15 minutes;Triangular shaped object with moving lights moving in side to side motion before disappearing February 20, 2014, 7:10p.m., Bend, Oregon.  We spotted a triangular shaped lighted object moving slowly across the sky from N-S, object moved both side to side and forwards very slowly.  Lights seemed to be emitted from a central source into a triangular shape.  Lights had a motion effect, not necessarily flashing.  No sound was heard.  Moved about for 15 minutes then disappeared up and out of sight.;44.047234231806;-121.327826415094

In the sky a small silver triangle, flashing lights, no chem trail or vapor trail emitting from the craft.  The triangle was spinning or rotating in a circle as it traveled north/north east across the sky.
