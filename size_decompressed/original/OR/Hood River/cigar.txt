Two UFO's sighted in Hood River Oregon;2011-04-19 22:45:00;10 minutes;Two UFO's sighted in Hood River Oregon At approximately 10:45p.m. on April 19, I was out smoking a cigarette when I noticed lights above the nearby school.  There seemed to be a large, dark cigar shaped craft hovering above the school. It had three bright lights on the bottom.  A few minutes later, a smaller craft showed up above my head about 10-15 feet above me. It had three bright lights on the bottom that changed colors.  It also made a low humming noise and caused my cell phone to twitch and be staticy.  It hovered above me for about 2 minutes and then took off incredibly fast to the west. The next night, I saw the same smaller craft. It appeared to be hovering above the apartment complex we live in as if it were observing. One person who lives in the same apartment community I do caught the craft on a video recorder.  I have also talked to about four other people who saw the same exact thing I did.;45.6728;-121.5398
Two long objects over Columbia River Gorge, disappeared into the clouds.;2018-07-28 14:06:00;8 minutes;Two long objects over Columbia River Gorge, disappeared into the clouds. We saw two large, long, white objects flying formation from west to east over the Columbia River Gorge.  They didn’t appear to have wings - they were just very long.  We are a military family and are familiar with aircraft.  These objects were two large to be any aircraft we know of - especially at the height they were at.  Commercial aircraft don’t fly formation.   The two objects appeared to stop twice mid air.  After the second stop the two objects appeared to merge then slowly moved sideways blending into the thunder clouds to the north of the river - disappearing from sight.  Both myself and my passenger looked at each other and wanted to know if the other saw what just happened.;45.6728;-121.5398
