Line of equally separated and travelling  across the sky from northwest toe south.  The speed they were travelling was fast.  This display last 45 seconds and then then each light disappeared in a sequence. I was out my patio door facing west and looked up as i always do at the night sky  saw the crescent moon and  what I assume was Jupiter (star), to the right of it.  I watched the line travel and called my son to observe the lights moving. We ran out the front door together and stood there watching the display!;50.7358;-113.9659
