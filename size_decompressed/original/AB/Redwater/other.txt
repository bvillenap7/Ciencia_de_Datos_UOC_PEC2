Square rotating craft heading towards edmonton alberta canada;2017-06-12 00:30:00;1 minute;Square rotating craft heading Towards edmonton alberta canada I was walking on a bike path, the clouds were being illuminated by the moon.  The clouds were low laying in formation, and were thick enough to block out the moons physical appearance from sight, but thin enough that the clouds were lit and appeared to be lit up and glowing from the light.  (I hope that makes sense)  I was admiring how bright they appeared, when from the north, a shadow of entered my sight and moved slowly south at what appeared to be a slow speed.  The shadow was rotating as well, and the craft appeared to be either a square shaped or cube, from the ground it looked as a square, it was a really slow rotation as it moved from the north moving south, in the direction towards Edmonton, Alberta.  It was just above the clouds, and shortly after, it left my view.   Within 5-10 minutes after, at the most, either a commercial or military plane flew over Redwater, flying from the southeast of the sky heading northwest.  My time of 12:30 might be a little off,  Hopefully, the flight from the plane can give a better idea to what time it was.  It was after 11pm, for,sure.;53.952;-113.1143
