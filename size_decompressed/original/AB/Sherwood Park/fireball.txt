She contends it was a meteor.  But to my knowldege meteors dont typically travel north to south at a consistent height nor at that speed and size with out crashing and taking out alot of real estate. i saw it down the roadway when i turned my head left with a unobstructed view while stopped waiting to make the turn on to said roadway.i saw it from as far away as possible with a completly unobstructed view and tried to follow it. but as fast as i saw it off in the way distance to my left i couldnt even turn my head fast enough to the right to keep it in view for more that 2 seconds. it was going perfectly north to south at a height of maybe 75 meters and was a large spherical object that had vivid green (fire around it) that i have never seen except when ! specific metals are burnt. as far as i know meteors dont stay level (they crash). but ive always been wary about telling people because of the stigma and laughter that goes with it. but i know what i saw and what i saw was a object moving faster than a meteor falls and it wasnt falling. it was level to the earth and was a event so fast that if you weren't looking right at it at the right time you would not have seen it. but i know what i saw nor am i crazy nor delusional. i am a intelligent man well balanced and i know whatever i saw was real. whatever it was it didnt crash and moved at a speed beyound staggering.;53.5213022222223;-113.26416
