Sherwood Park (southeast area);1999-06-15 00:00:00;2 min;Sherwood Park (southeast area) A friend and I saw an orange light southeast of Sherwood Park just north of Meyers Lake.  We were driving to my house, I was 17 at the time, and as I was turning a corner we noticed the light which there was no explanation as to why it was there.  I was so noticable that we actually drove towards it and opened the windows in the vehicle.  We could not tell how close it was to us but the light was smaller from what I remember and not very far away.  A sound did accompany it but I can't recall how it was so the sound itself wasn't too odd I guess.  After reading about those people in Sh pk/Ardrossan, Alberta and what they saw... it reminded me of this. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Four lights above the clouds moving silently in large circles like small planes searching.  ((NUFORC Note:  Advertising lights?  PD));2009-08-21 23:00:00;30 min +;Four lights above the clouds moving silently in large circles like small planes searching Four lights above the clouds moving silently in individual large circles like small planes searching, sometimes moving back together at the centre of their circle. It was cloudy and there was occasional lightning on the western horizon. No stars were visible. I first noticed them when I was standing on the road with my dog. I looked up to see how heavy the clouds were and noticed the lights, which were each about the size of a moon but with fuzzy edges because they were above the clouds. My first thought was Northern Lights or some weird form of lightning. Then I looked for a beam of light which would indicate they were searchlights from the ground but saw nothing. Nervous, I returned to the house and watched them from the deck. They continued swooping, circling in a clockwise direction, regrouping in the centre. After about 30 minutes, I went back inside so I don't know how long the display continued. I'm in a semi-rural area south of Sherwood Park and just east of Edmonton.

Crazy.  Lights streak across the sky.;2018-10-19 17:45:00;1 minute;Crazy.  Lights streak across the sky. My wife and I were sitting in our hot tub looking at the sky.  We seen a number of planes earlier in the night, then out of nowhere a bright light caught our eye and we started talking and then again out of nowhere at the same time we pointed to the sky telling each other to look.  We seen two blue lights streaking across the sky followed by a red light.  Shortly after that we seen another blue light followed by a red light doing something side to side.  The lights didn't flicker.  Shortly after that we seen another blue/green light streak across the sky.  They were not clustered together or in a formation but going the same direction.  They went incredibly fast and disappeared out of our view.;53.5213022222223;-113.26416
