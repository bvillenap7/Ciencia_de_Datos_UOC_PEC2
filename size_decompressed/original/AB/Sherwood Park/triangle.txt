5 dim lights, Triangle in shape.;2019-09-13 16:50:00;4 seconds;5 dim lights, Triangle in shape 5 dim lights (two on the left, 3 on the right) in a triangle shape, (on the west side of Sherwood Park Ab) looked to be about as high as a traffic helicopter or single engine plane would fly, heading north north west, traveling at a high rate of speed in a perfectly straight line, it looked so effortless....no sound what so ever!  Moving way to fast to be a plane or chopper but not as fast as a meteor would be....  I am hoping someone else seen this! It was so weird It even made me talk out load to myself.. Well, that was f*#ked up!!;53.5213022222223;-113.26416
