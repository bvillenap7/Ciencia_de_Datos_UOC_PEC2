Mid-way through the conversation I noticed to the North of me 9 eggshaped objects flying in a V formation from east to west. I told my wife what I was watching and because she was on a farm about two miles North it would have been possible for her to see them too, but from the other side. She was unable to locate them in the 45sec. or so it took them to fly west. The objects were an off white and completely silent. Some of the objects changed place in the formation and if they were geese, as what I first thought was possible I would have seen their wings move. These objects maintained level flight through out. I phoned the local military base and they knew nothing and showed no interest I my description. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));53.5213022222223;-113.26416
