bright light spinning around with flashing lights;2005-09-04 02:00:00;30 minutes;bright light spinning around with flashing lights we were looking outside at the northen lights and we noticed a unusualy bright star. i had a poor telescope under my bed so we ran inside to get that. our first look at it it seemed like there was lights around it, black lines going horizontaly. We thought at first it was simply a satilte but after a further look we knew what we saw. It was the color of any other star except ALOT brighter. It was also spinning and moving place to place (very slowying not sudden jerks).;53.5213022222223;-113.26416
