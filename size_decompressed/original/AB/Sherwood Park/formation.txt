Red lights in sky, flying in formation.;2016-01-15 20:00:00;5 minutes;Red lights in sky, flying in formation. Approximately 8:00pm 5 red glowing objects appeared from the southeast, moving in formation.  There was no sound. When the objects reached overhead, a sixth red glowing object cam from the same direction, caught up to the 5, and moved off to the Northwest, as a airline jet was approaching from the south, probably left from Edmonton international airport.  I am certain the jet liner would have seen them.   The red light that illuminated each object was pulsing.  The objects were circular in shape.;53.5213022222223;-113.26416
