Looking into west sky we saw a big round object. It was glowing yellow and the sky was greeny red behind the object and very cloudy around the object.  It moved horizontally back and forth in a small wavy motion. It was moving very quickly. We first spotted it in an open field. It lasted approximately 10 - 15 minutes. After disappearing behind the clouds we noticed it again in the south moving back to the west in the same small wavy motion. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.
