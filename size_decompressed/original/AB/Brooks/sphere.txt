While my wife is washing our dishes before going to sleep around 11:00 pm she saw something out the window, moving flying star, then she told me while im feeding our pet fish, then she go out and check and &quotit was there&quot &quotcome take a look quick&quot she said, then I go out to our deck and saw it,  it was look like a start but its twice brighter, then it stops then few minutes it moves again until it went gone for 2 minutes.  After 2-3 minutes another one on a wavy movement then it stop then move straight then stop then move again it took like 3-4 minutes on our view area but this time its thrice the briteness of the star, while seeing this second thing acroos it we saw another one spinning around on a circle movement then stop then again. on our back corner we saw 2 moving at the same time then stop then move, then saw another one again, the skay is very clear, tried to capture it through our iphone and ipads but cant see it on a video, we tried to capture it a! lso through nikon s01 but is is very small and not clear, took of my scope on my sniper rifle and look through it but it just became bigger like 5%.
