Floating Barge seen near Suffield Air Base Alberta Canada Jan. 02. 2012;2012-01-02 07:20:00;1 min;Floating Barge seen near Suffield Air Base Alberta Canada Jan. 02. 2012 I was out in the prairie running the dogs along the irrigation cannel Jan 2 2012 3-4 miles south of Brooks... I saw a cigar shaped UFO gliding through the sky soundless and right in front of me.  I watched it glide towards Suffield Air Base (40 miles away) it glided right over Brooks at 7:20 am with pitch black and semi clear sky's and just a bit of cloud over Brooks.  I had my camera there, but I decided when I first realised what I was witnessing not to take my eyes off of it.  The whole experience lasted maybe less than 60 secs before it disappeared out of sight moving east slowly but so smoothly ...the image is burned in my brain I saw it with the city lights reflecting through the clouds below it and its own lights reflecting off the clouds above and around it. I saw it slide through the clouds and for brief moments caught it's full profile in  clear pockets in the clouds ---it was huge!  At that distance it looked like a straight, thick stick or floating barge in the sky the size of an aircraft carrier... with one orange-ish red non blinking light sitting on top of the front end and one yellowish non blinking light on top of the back end.....The craft looked darkish brown/grey it was lit up by the reflection of it's own lights on the clouds as it slide in a straight line eastwards like an air hockey puck sliding across the sky slowly and steadily out of sight.;50.582;-111.8867
