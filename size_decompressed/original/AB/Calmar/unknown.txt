Fastest dot I have ever seen in the sky!;2013-09-09 13:10:00;45-90 seconds;Fastest dot I have ever seen in the sky! At around 13:10 I came out to have a cigarette, of which I usually observe my surroundings, and happened to notice a com-trail or jet trail out of the corner of my eye.  As I had a better look I noticed I could not see the plane, only a tiny dot.  What really got my attention (and the reason for this report) was the emence speed of the craft.  It took less than a minute to go from the south horizon to the north horizon. Even if this was a plane, It's something of a sort I have never seen or heard of before.;53.2514;-113.7773
