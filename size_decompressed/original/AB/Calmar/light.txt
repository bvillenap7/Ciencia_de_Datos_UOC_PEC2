I am wondering if anyone else saw a unidentified floating object above the Calmar AB area at 7:00 to 7:10 PM Oct 1/19    For at least ten minutes I observed a Bright light slowly ascending directly upward.  It did not dim and it did not move East to West or North to South, just straight up.   It was below the lite clouds at the time, then it started passing upward through the cloud fading a bit, then it just vanished.;53.2514;-113.7773
