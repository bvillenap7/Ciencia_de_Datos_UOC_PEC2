Mutiples of 3 green v shaped objects flying in green beam.;2017-02-26 04:10:00;20 minutes;Mutiples of 3 green v shaped objects flying in green beam. I was having a smoke on my deck and watching the Northern lights and look above me when I notice this green beam going from S.E to N.W. In this beam were 3 green v objects flying in formation with 3 more behind it continuesly for 20 minutes at very high speed and then stopped. The green originated above some clouds to southeast and faded into the Northern lights to the northwest.  The length of the beam if I were to use my hands for reference would be about 2 feet long.  I don't know what distance that would be in space. I tried previously to capture video of northern lights with cell phone and the video was too dark to see anything.  So it was pointless wish I had a video camera that night. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));53.2514;-113.7773
