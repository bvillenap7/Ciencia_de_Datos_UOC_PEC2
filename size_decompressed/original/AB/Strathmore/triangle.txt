Hazy Orange/red Triangle;2003-07-23 01:15:00;Night;Hazy Orange/red Triangle Well I saw 2 objects, one after another - same color, same hazy/orange/red  1)the first one looked like >o< and it swayed back and forth while moving west to Calgary, Alberta *west* - i ruled out satilite because i know they dont move like that.  2) the second one made me through my chair back and scream what the f*ck is going on several times.... which i never do when im alone. It looked like this *without the periods*  .o o ..o .....o   they were the same orange lights, very distinctive, and clear.  it was really orange this time, made no noise whatsoever, and moved STRAIGHT west/north this time, it came from the same direction as the other light, although this one like i said, didnt move other than in a straight line... Give me some sanity and tell me that i am not seeing stuff and going crazy. this is the first time i saw something.....like.....this.;51.0484;-113.3829
