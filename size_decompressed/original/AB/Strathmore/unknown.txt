It was on its side, the size of a quarter of the moon its pulsed gentley redish. once in a while black circles would pass over the surface in a way it distorted the surface.  Half the time there was this bright light behind it jaded in shape not smooth shape.  It appeared to shift up and down and from side to side, it move out of sight heading west heading down over the horizon. ((NUFORC Note:  Venus??
