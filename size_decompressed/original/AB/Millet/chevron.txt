We noticed red lights traveling north at a very low altitude. Three red lights moved in unison. V shaped. We see many airplanes and know their usual flight paths. There was only red glowing lights. Larger than airplane lights. It traveled very slowly and really low. There was no noise and we can normally hear any aircraft as they travel towards the airport.  It continued to the north northeast at very slow pace away from airport until we could no longer see it. Weather was mostly clear and calm with good star visibility.  We live in the country with a good night sky.The event lasted about 30 minutes. Did not move like an airplane or helicopter. Husband is a Civil Engineer. I am farmer.;53.0795;-113.4676
