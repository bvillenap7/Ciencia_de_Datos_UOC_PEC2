Two different crafts sighted in the same night by two people;2005-07-30 23:40:00;35 secs;Two different crafts sighted in the same night by two people My wife and I were sitting outside at a campfire at 11:40 pm when the triangle ship passed overhead. The ends of the triangle shape were squared and there were lights in all three corners (white lights )  In the center bottom of the craft was a red light.  The total sight time was about 8 seconds.  At 12:00 midnight, while we were still talking about what we saw, we witnessed about 8- 12 light coming from the east heading west in the same direction the first ship went.  Each lights was shaped almost like a boomarang with a small tail,  f you will, at the back end.   They were weaving and bobbing around and under one another so it was hard to get an accurate count but I know there were at least 8 probably 10 of them.   We watched them till they disappeared( about 15 seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));52.0285;-113.9596
