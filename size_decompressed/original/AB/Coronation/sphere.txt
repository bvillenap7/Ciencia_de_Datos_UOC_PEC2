Faint spherical &quotcloud&qu Looked out window to the east to see if Mars was up yet.  Sky clear, very few clouds, rising full moon.  Faint spherical cloud one half size of full moon catches my attention.  It's moving steadily south to north about 30 degrees above the eastern horizon.  With binoculars it appeared green/gold in colour.  Gave all the appearance of a glowing translucent sphere.  The halo was circular and slightly brighter at the edges.  There were no distinct or sharpe edges.  It looked more like glowing gas than a solid structure.  Within the sphere was an indistinct brightness just up from centre with a little brightness extending to the top of the sphere. Details appeared even less distinct as it moved and lowered towards the northern horizon.;52.0848;-111.4482
