Saw 3 bright lights and 2 smaller lights in the sky with strange zig zag moving patterns,. ((NUFORC Note:  Planets in E sky.  PD));2012-07-29 02:30:00;3 hours;Saw three bright lights and 2 smaller lights in the sky with strange zig zag moving patterns, no sound or noice to them. We were parked down a dirt road surrounded by tall grass, some trees, a lot of bats flying around and millions of mosquitoes.   Thats when we saw two bright lights hovering over the tree line.   When they moved they went kinda sideways like a zig-zag pattern, then hover again...  They were slowly heading south and moving higher into the sky.  A third bright light came from the west and moved at a steady pace across the sky past the first two and then it seemed to just disappear.   The other two bright lights took almost 2 hours to move slowly upwards as they seemed to be mostly hovering.  No noice or sound at all.   It wasn't until the sun started to rise that the bright lights began to decend higher and higher at a quicker pace, until they were completely out of site.  It's like they disappeared into the sky. I don't know what I saw up there but it was not a plane or a chopper!! We watched them for almost 3 hours straight.  Amazing experience...  what ever they are! !!  ((NUFORC Note:  Planets in E sky.
