I was watching the meteor shower in my back yard in Olds, Alberta.  At approximately 0020 hours, I witnessed a large winged triangle shaped object moving across the sky from north to south.  It had no lights that I could see.  It seemed to be surrounded with a visible outline that ‘rippled’ (as if a pebble thrown into a pond) engulfing the shape till the ripples reached the solid shape.  While you could see stars through this ripple effect, the triangle shape and wings appeared solid, obscuring the star light beyond as it moved.  It was absolutely silent and moved slowly in a gliding fashion.   I watched it for 1-2 minutes, or so.  I have never seen anything move like that.  It made me extremely uncomfortable/anxious, and, once out of my view, I returned to my house.   I am a nurse with a master’s degree and partial completion of my PhD.;51.7816;-114.0941
