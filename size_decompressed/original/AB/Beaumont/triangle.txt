3 red/orange dots make triangle in sky.;2013-12-25 18:26:00;5 minutes;3 red/orange dots make triangle in sky I saw a slow moving red/orange light pass the window while I was watching TV.  I thought it was a helicopter.  Then I saw the second one.  I peeked out the blinds and saw 3 red/orange lights making the shape of a triangle. I ran to the back door telling mom I think I see something out side.  We opened the sliding door to our back yard.  And we saw the 3 lights making the triangle shape. I turned off the volume on the TV and we didn't hear a single noise coming from the thing in the sky. I could see a star right above our back yard, and another star over one of the duplex's across our back yard. But I couldn't see any stars between the 3 lights.  So I think they were on the corners of something solid. But I couldn't see anything solid. It was going south over the duplex's back yards, when it came to the end of the back yards, it seemed to bank and spin to turn south east over the town houses at the end of our block.  I remembered my iPod. When I got back to the door, the iPod couldn't' see the lights at all so it wouldn't take a picture of what we were seeing. Then we heard a plane flying over head, we could hear the plane and see the lights and flashing lights on the plane, the plane looked higher in the sky then the triangle thing. I ran up stairs and looked out my mom's bedroom window to watch it slowly move out of town and the rear lights winked out of sight.  Then the front light eventually winked out as well.;53.3466;-113.4143
