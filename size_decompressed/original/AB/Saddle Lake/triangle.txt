Lights far above,  that glance then flee from the celestrialhavens, only to appear again.;1979-10-10 22:00:00;4.5 or more min.;Lights far above,  that glance then flee from the celestrialhavens, only to appear again. This is my first time doing anything of this nature. I was looking up in the night sky, when I saw 5 very vivid and quizzical lights in a triangler formation. The odd thing was that it was stationed perfectly above or in the middle of the sky. The night sky was filled with stars that night as well. I noticed points of light that were steady in speed, which I quickly realized were orbitting satelights. However that formation was completely different and stood out. As I watched it, it turned half way one way then made another turn half way in the oppisite direction. Then the object turn 3/4s around and clearly sped to the left turned and sped back to its original position, then sped straight off the axis or curviture of the earth. Then I knew what I saw in fact was something not of this earths technology or design. I know that we are being watched. I know that we are being visited. I know that higher governments are fictionalizing and adding conjecture to these occurences. What really upsets me, is that when todays reporting of those and these sighting the REPORTERS themseleves are covering their tracks, so that the viewers get a vague sense of reality or an very incomplete picture, which leads to speculation. Please stop and realize that far too many people know what's going on. Even now our governments are realizing this. However, if REPORTERS continue to be vague then of course our governments have nothing to worry about because their secerts will continue to be safe for now. Do more raddling of the cage, keep barking up that tree, and for all our sakes BE CONSISTANT & RELENTLESS! E-mail for any further questions or concerns. Thank you for your understanding and time.
