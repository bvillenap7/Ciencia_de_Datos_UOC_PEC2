Three orange lights around the back. The craft made no noise at all.  I seen it from a back road it must of been about 10-18 feet wide judging by how far the lights were apart. Many others have seen it that night but i was the closest. I was about 75 meters away about 50-75 meters high. This happened in a reserve called sucker creek.  The craft flew over a gas station named Badger Towne.  I sighted it near another gas station named rubys. I could tell the object was ronded because the lights.;55.4324;-116.4829
