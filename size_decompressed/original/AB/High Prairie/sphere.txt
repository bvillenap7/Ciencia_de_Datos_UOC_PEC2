I was standing outside smoking like i always do, when i seen a bright blue light in the sky , i dismissed it think it was an airplane until i noticed it stopped moving ... It was stationary in mid air, not in space yet still above the clouds.  I watched closely, thats when it started to look brighter and it changed from being blue to being blue green yellow.  All different colors and suddenly all the bright lights shut off and it turned to only a few orange and red lights around it.  And thats when it came so close that i seen the shape. It was spherical almost like a ball.  But it had legs coming from the botton . It just hovers. Its almost like it doesnt even fly it just sits up there in the sky. And by then my heart was racing i was looking for my phone.  But i didnt have it on me.  So i kept watching it, but i kept staring at the sky, and thats when my girlfriend cane , and i pointed it out and she can see it bright as day and she was amazed at how bright! and colorful it looked. not even two minutes later the clouds were blown away and i seen it, floating there stationary again. And thats when it started head nw at a high speed and 30 sexonds later it had gone so far away i lost sight of it.;55.4324;-116.4829
