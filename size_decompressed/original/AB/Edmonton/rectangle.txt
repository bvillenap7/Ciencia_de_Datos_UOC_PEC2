Silver colored rectangle with yellow glow on top 1/8 spotted over Edmonton, AB, Canada;2006-08-19 08:00:00;5 Min;Silver colored rectangle with yellow glow on top 1/8 spotted over Edmonton, AB, Canada I got up early Sunday morning, and was walking down my block towards corner store for paper, it was a beautiful morning, no traffic, no one on either side of street.  I was admiring the huge trees along our block, and upon looking up noticed something between branches, it just caught my eye as I looked up.  As I walked further to a point between the trees, a clear unobstructed view, I say what I term as a large phone booth object at about 70 degrees from southern horizon.  I stopped rubbed my eyes, shook my head. and it was still there.  It was a silver to whitish color except for the top 1/8 which was a brilliant yellowish light. I stood for a couple minutes trying to get a good look at it. I estimate the altitude to be about 1500-2000 ft.  It had no wings, no rotors, and stood perfectly still, there was no wind it was dead calm.  I tried to listen and could hear nothing.  After about 3 minutes it finally hit me, this was definitely not normal and defied any aerodynamic craft I have ever scene.  I started to get scared, and proceeded towards the store, hoping it had not seen me, keeping my eyes on it, when the next moment it started to accelerate and then took off East at a speed that was unbelievable, before I knew it it was out of sight.  I would estimate its size being aprox 20-30 ft tall by 15 to 20 ft across.;53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259

I was sitting in Seat 5A which would be the left side of the plane near the front.   Around 5:30 pm I was looking out the window and I saw an object which initially i believed to be a plane.   But I was curious so I kept watching it...It appeared to be heading towards my planes direction.   I remember noting the altitude of the  plane on the display screen on the seat ahead of me, which I had in map mode.  It became more and more evident as the object got closer that it wasnt a plane, as it got closer I noticed no smoke emissions coming from the object and it did not have any flashing indicator lightss which are required on all aircraft, civilian or military.  The object never got close enough for me to guage its exact shape but if i was willing to hazard a guess I would say it was rectangular in shape.  It was close enough for me to know it wasnt a propellor plane.  The object trailed off behind the plane and i craned my neck until I could no longer see it.  I don't think it got within a couple miles of the plane I was in. Let me remind you that it was a perfectly clear evening, not a cloud in the sky...absolutly perfect dusk with an ample amount of light left in the sky. Still staring out of my window it was 5 minutes after the sighting a military aircraft flew very close to the plane, im not a pilot by any stretch of the imagination but I know it was a fighter jet. It was possibly 700 m from the plane. In fact the pilot of the westjet flight lifted the wing on the side of the aircraft that i was on (which means he broke out of autopilot) as the jet passed. It couldnt have been because of the proximity because the jet was far enough away...The jet was heading directly in the direction of the craft that i had just seen. The jet had had a smoke trail behind it but not a th! ick one like a commercial jet...anyways i know I saw something! I can e xplain..THought i would share;53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259
