These things moved like nothing I,ve ever seen before.;2002-06-25 01:01:00;7-10 seconds;These things moved like nothing I,ve ever seen before. I had just joined my wife on the deck and was showing her how to find the north star...for a few moments we sat on the step looking our own ways when right through my line of site two shere shapes rotating around each other moved through the sky from north to south. My first impression due to the G8 summit was that it was some kind of spot lights, but as I tried to point it out to my wife I realized that not only was it a very clear night but that the objects moved in a straight line and very fast as they twisted around each other. My guess is that they were at about 5000-10000 feet, or about as high as an airliner would fly, that is one reason it was not a plane, it was to fast and made no sound at all. If it wasn't a ufo then I have no idea what it could have been,I have seen some odd things in the sky but could always figure out some kind of expaination, I've never seen anything like this before.;53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259

silent booerang object flying very low and fast;2004-05-23 23:30:00;20 seconds;silent booerang object flying very low and fast there was three of us in our hot tub which is outside. i saw a boomerang shaped light or object travelling very fast below a few clouds that were presently in the sky.by the time i was able to point it out to my two friends that were with me , it was directly above us, still travelling very fast but was silent... no noise at all which was surprising for the speed it was travelling.  jets from the airport regularily fly above us but only travell not even  a third of the speed of this object and there is quite a loud jet noise.my first thought was a stealth bomber but they are black and can be heard from such a low altitude.;53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259
Four lights of UFO in sky, moving slowly, changing directions, flies off.;2005-06-10 01:00:00;20 seconds;Four lights of UFO in sky, moving slowly, changing directions, flies off. I was travelling with my friend in his truck to grab coffee at a Tim Horton's 10-12 blocks away from my apartment, through a residential area.  I was looking out the open window of the truck as anyone would when I looked up to see what I thought might be a plane in the sky.  What struck me as odd was that it was going very slowly and the lights didn't resemble those of a jet or plane.  I saw 4 brilliant lights alligned perfectly in a square formation, moving slowly in the sky, southwest of where we were.  I asked my friend to stop and ran out of his truck to a nearby yard to see it more clearly (he did not come out of his truck because he was bewildered at why I suddenly yelled at him to stop and got out of the vehicle).  Staring up at the sky, I was intrigued to see that the object was in fact moving slowly, but not consistently.  It would move (in my field of view) about 3-4 inches across the sky, then would stop suddenly, then move again.  It then moved the OPPOSITE way back and flew very quickly out of site into the dark sky- trees and the houses then blocked my view.  At that point, I struggled to see it again, but I could not.  My friend had gotten out of my truck to ask me what had happened, and I told him the above, much to his disbelief.  I SWEAR that happened.  No drugs, not drunk, it was unbelievable, intriguing and frightful all at the same time. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I thought it was a star, then a satelitte-but by its sudden shot out to the right I knew it was something else;2005-08-25 19:00:00;30-45s;I thought it was a star, then a satelitte-but by its sudden shot out to the right I knew it was something else I was out on my patio, I always look at the stars-so I look up and see what I thought was a star. It started moving in a figure eight pattern.  I thought okay maybe its a satelite. Then the satelite stopped and all I seen next was it moving so fast to the right, that I saw a line of light and it was gone. (Just like on Star Trek with their warp speed) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259
Round shape with bright orange tail;2011-10-09 06:30:00;20 min approx;Round shape with bright orange tail After dropping someone at the Edmonton International Airport, on the way back on Hwy. 2 just after Nisku at approximately 6:30am, my daughter(9) noticed something in the clouds east in the dawn light - this morning – Oct9/11.  She was adamant that it was more than clouds, I strained to see it (only slight dawn light).  She noted that it did not have lights like an airplane. I told her it was a promotional balloon likely for a car dealership in Sherwood Park.  At this point I was at Ellerslie and Parsons Road intersection.  I could make out the orange tail in the shape.  I had decided to drive east to watch the sunrise and my daughter watched the shape (which I thought was nothing). As we drove east on the Anthony Henday, we noticed the shape started moving and quite fast.  It had appeared almost suspended previously, thus the promotional balloon explanation - except quite high and large.  I then realized it was forsure not a promotional balloon. By the time we got to Hwy 14 and the Anthony Henday, I pulled over and we watched the shape disappear into the clouds.  There was a white suv heading east on the Anthony Henday that would have seen it too if they were looking into the sky. My daughter drew the image immediately after we returned home.;53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259

15 minutes out of Edmonton, Alberta.;2017-08-11 22:30:00;2 hours;15 minutes out of edmonton. They blended like stars.  Till we seen them moving, then realized there was more than one.  Over a course of the 2 hours we were there.  We watched them drive the sky.  They went zigzag, shooting strait and stopping.  Looked like they were searching….then they stop and act like a star.  And not move.  If I didn’t see it moving, I would have thought it was a star.   There was a meteor shower happening, we couldn’t be the only ones to see what we saw!;53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259
Work night shift and while on break at 0330 hours saw what I thought was a plane flying with no marker lights on and made absolutely no;2017-12-06 03:30:00;10-15 seconds;Work night shift, and while on break at 0330 hours, saw what I thought was a plane flying with no marker lights on and made absolutely no sound.  It travelled from west to east in a straight line.  It appeared to be in the shape of an x, as an aircraft with wings would, and its color appeared to be grey/white.  There was a very bright moon out at the time and not a cloud in the sky.   I am a sky watcher and also an air show enthusiast and have never seen something like this before.  Would love an explanation!;53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259
