It travelled NE slowly and as it passed overhead, there was a glow, like fire, on the port side, -like a burner.  But it was dead silent.  We watched for about 3 minutes.  It then veered NW and the glow burned out- and the object went all grey. It was after that point silhouetted against setting sun and seemed black and round.   There was no balloon, blimp, or anything I recognized.  It was not a shooting star nor a toy rocket.    Observers were one teacher and one senior.   No alcohol, no drugs-out walking dogs.  I estimate 22:45, as I had no watch-but arrived home (one block)-at about 22:50. ;53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259

There was a major thunderstorm earlier so the clouds in the sky were dark and layered.  The light never moved.  It was not dark enough yet to be a star and to low to be the space station.  I took out my phone and took 2 quick pictures in about a second. I then looked up and it was gone.  A guy came out of the pub and I was telling him about what I had seen then I was pointing to where it was and then seen it again just over the top of the trees closer towards me, so I went to take another picture and it disappeared in front of me as if someone had turned a light switch off.   Then my cab came.  When I got home I was telling my roommate about it so I wanted to show the pictures so the first one which was actually the second one there was nothing there so I just figured I didn't catch it.  But a couple days later I was looking at the picture bu! t decided to look at the second one which was the first one and there it was after I zoomed in but it wasn't a ball of light it was a cylinder shape at an angle, so I zoomed in more and I can make out 3 distinct bluish lights.  I took both those pictures within a second so that's how quick it was there and gone.   I still have the pictures on my phone.  I had forgotten about it till tonight and when I read the post tonight from the Medicine Hat report it sounded exactly like what I had seen.  So the medicine hat sighting was 7 mins before my sighting.  I don't know how to include the picture but it is available;53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259
cluster of bright colored lights;2020-08-26 02:30:00;hours;cluster of bright colored lights cluster of red, green, blue and white lights.  Seen off my balcony.  They moved constantly in different directions but stayed fairly stationary with the odd one going out of formation for a short period of time and then going back to the formation. It was there for at least 2 hours;53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259
