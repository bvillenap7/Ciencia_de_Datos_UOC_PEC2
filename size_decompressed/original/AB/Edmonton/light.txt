Estimated range was about 5 kilometers. Object accelerated and decelerated at very high Gs. Object also changed color while performing manuevers = from a orange=white to red to green to blue and at random.  Our vehicle was traveling northbound towards the small town of Saint Albert. The base is east of the highway. Night sky was clear and weather was typically warm and dry.  Sighting reports of lights in the sky were printed in the next day's local paper. I recall at the moment the object accelerated towards the vehicle a distinct feeling of fear when it stopped.  The object accelerated away at a tremendously high G towards the northeast.;53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259
erratic light in the night sky;2000-09-05 23:00:00;5 min;erratic light in the night sky The object was too far away to discern shape, it seemed like a very bright star.  I originally thought it was a satellite, because it was slowly moving in the southwest sky. But the light was making eratic movements almost like figure 8's, in every direction. I could not determine what it was which was there for about 5 minutes then gone.????????;53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259

We looked at it at and it moved really fast. Too fast to be a plane. it finally went behind us, I looked backed and the lights like burnt out and then it was gone. It had blue and red lights on top and bright lights at the bottom. I cannot remember the other bit because to spoked now. It had a sound but did not sound like a plane or man made air crafts.

Fast ball in the sky;2004-03-23 23:15:00;15;Fast ball in the sky I was outside at the family farm 45 minuets from Edmonton Alberta, having a cigarette all the dogs in the county were barking away and at first I passed it off as being a large amount of coyote activity. As I was walking in from my smoke I noticed a star far brighter then the rest, but then I noticed it was moving with a in a z motion through the sky near Oran’s ((sic.  Orion's)) belt in a north eastern direction sometimes giving the appearance of a tail, it seemed to slow down and became brighter as this happened the our dogs (who had calmed down) started barking even louder then they had been all night the horses could even be heard running around there was a little larger flash and it was gone. After all this our dogs clamed down but you could still here the other dogs most of the night. My mother and Stepfather were in the house when all this happened and aside from the dogs barking and then just stopping my family did not wittiness any of the lights. To my knowledge there have been several sightings in the area over the past ten years or so. Some of these sightings have been recorded and seen by many people, others were by a few and far between.

4 lights gathered together and moved in patterns in the Canadian sky, Edmonton Alberta;2004-06-23 01:00:00;2 hours;4 lights gathered together and moved in patterns in the Canadian sky, Edmonton Alberta I was sitting with my girl friend on a hill in a local park, with minimal light and watched for about 90 minutes as 4 distinct lights hovered above us, very high up. There was 1 very bright one and 3 smaller ones. At first I thought it was a satelite or something, but it had an unnatural way of speeding up and slowing down, not drasticly but enough to notice with the eye. The lights also gathered together fairly close in the sky at times and spread out again. And would travel in one direction for a while before curving back at a very sharp turn into another direction. Cloud cover finally blocked them out and I had to pack it in around 3 am when they were lost.  Nothing I could think of would be able to travel with no com trail, no blinking lights, so far up in the sky they're mere dots, zig zagging and changing direction so quickly and with no sounds or anything. It was the strangest thing iv ever seen in the sky before. ((NUFORC Note:  We will correspond with the witness, in order to establish whether the lights might have been advertising lights.  Such a possibility does not seem likely to us, but that has to be ruled out.  PD));53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259
Bright light outside of Edmonton/Sherwoodpark;2004-11-28 10:00:00;2 minutes;Bright light outside of Edmonton/Sherwoodpark Amazing that this happened to me!  As I went outside I heard a cat crying out in pain. Long story short, i found a stay cat that was reall just skin an bones.... it ate 5 cans of cat food... :\  But as I was feeding this poor kitty, I saw a bright white light off in the distance. I would say it was SOUTH WEST of true north.  This is not the first UFO I have seen in these parts. Last time I saw a UFO WEST of my location.  I live OUTSIDE of Edmonton, Alberta.  I am near 2 SMALL air ports. So I see alot of planes. I even remeber once I saw a black unmarked helecopter as a child that flew no more than 10-20 feet over out house... I never thought about the importance of that incedent till recently. See as how thoes unmarked helecopters have been reported many times when it came to UFOs and even more CATTLE mutalations. Altought as far as I know I personly have not heard of cattle mutalations in my area.  Anyways, as I was feeding this poor cat, I saw a bright light off in the distance. Off in the direction of SHERWOOD PARK. It is a town outside of Edmonton. I wanted to eyeball this light as long as I could, but trying to keep attention to the poor sick cat and the fact that small trees where in my way. I did not stay entirely focused to it.  I would say about a minute or 2 after I saw the bright light, it just vanished.  I would say it was VERY far away, but it could not of been a star consider how low it was to the horizen.  This time of year up here it gets dark quite quickly, and I can honestly say I have never seen a star that was that bright at this time, or even moved around for that matter.  This bright object moved around a tiny bit within the 1 to 2 minutes I watched it. It did not move in random patterns... But I would say it moved UP... not UP UP like into space or the atomsphere, but UP....  It was a LARGE distance away, but no plane or anything of that nature could produce such a bright light from that far away.  I really wanted to get my binoculars, so I could view the object, but being only human, I could only help the poor starving cat. I lost site of the object, (from my view from beyond the trees) quite quit.  All the trees around here have lost thier leaves, but I still was not wearing my glasses. But for a bright object to dissapear like that within the time period and direction it was moving and the fact there was no red or blue lights, which rules out any airplane, just leaves me boggled.  I lived on farm land, and from whats I have noticed on this web site is that sometimes Advertizing lights can be a factor in a UFO report. But let me tell you this, never have I heard or seen or even considered the fact that advertising lightings will be within or around the area of Edmonton, Alberta.  OH, and if your wondering, the stray cat is at a SAFE shelter now. :) By now he will of been adopted.  If I had to estimate the distance of the object I would say......  Quite far.....  From my current location, I would say I was still a large distance away...  Even if I got over to the closest highway, I would still say I was still 1/6 distance away from it.  It was far... but very bright.   FYI: I also saw this object, while an Meteor shower was occouring, and I can tell you that this was no Meteor. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Canadian aliens??????;2008-02-16 02:17:00;1 hour and going!!;Canadian aliens?????? I can’t belive what I’am seeing!!!!!  It’s about a quarter after 2 in the morning just having my last smoke before bed, and I see it. It looks like a star at first, a bright light but it looks sooo out of place, then I notice a shadow behind it. I looked hard to make sure I was seeing this, I adjusted my eyes, wiped my glasses, but it was still there!!!  I watched an episode of unsolved mysteries last week and it was about people in Mexico who witnessed the same thing. It looked like a star, but with a shadow behind it just hovering there above their city  in BROAD DAYLIGHT!!!!!!  This wasn’t day time but what I’am seeing right now as we speak, is a blueish white light on the left side of the moon. It has a shadow behind it, hovering like the wind is blowing it a bit.  I wish I had a number to call to report this because this is still happening!!!!!!  There should be a 24 hour hotline to call about this kind of stuff!!!! ((NUFORC Note:  There is a 24-hour hotline.  A person may call our hotline at any time, and leave a message.  The witness may have been observing a star or planet, we suspect.  PD));53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259
Bright star like object moves across sky in strange patterns 3:30 am in edmonton.;2008-05-19 03:30:00;10-20 minutes;Bright star like object moves across sky in strange patterns 3:30 am in edmonton. It was in the early morning that me and a friend decided to take a stroll down to a nearby public park to talk and star gaze. The park was an open field with many trees lining the border. The sky was still dark with a clear view of the stars. While viewing the stars, we noticed a very large bright light, slightly larger then a satellite, and its altitude was much higher then that of a plane. This light began to move from its position in the sky downwards, at about a 45 degree angle, with a significant speed. This object made abrupt quick movements as though it was shaking.   It would occasionally speed up, then slow down. It continued this pattern until it was almost directly above us, and we noted that it was not a plane. It was silent, and every so often a very small tail (ray, or spark) would be visible upon it. The light seemed to have a reddish glow emitting off of it every so often. After passing over us, it switched direction and began to hover downwards, slower than before. After watching it for a while longer, it then vanished. Certainly, it was not anything I had ever witnessed before, not a comet nor a satellite. Definitely not an airplane or alike craft.  My friend and I are both 22 year old females. We were both 100% sober during this sighting.;53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259
Balls of lights dancing in the clouds.;2008-10-24 22:00:00;15 minutes;Balls of lights dancing in the clouds. My daughter age 29, and myself age 58, went outside for a smoke.  It was night time and our attention was drawn to lights moving around in the clouds overhead.  There were three lights, all of circular shape, having a blueish-white color and being somewhat brighter in the center.  At first we only noticed two lights and thought they must be search lights because the lights appeared to be going in circles.  But then as the clouds, which were closely bunched together and overlapping each other, started to seperate, the pattern of the lights movements changed and that's when we noticed a third light.  We then realized the lights didn't have a particular pattern. Their movement went according to the shape of the cloud it was in.  If the cloud had a tail the light moved out to the tip, then retraced it's path, then moved along the outside parimeter of the cloud.  All three lights were doing the same thing with the cloud it was in.  They were following the outside parimeter of the clouds no matter what shape the cloud changed into.  Then the lights started to jump from cloud to cloud.  Two lights didn't remain in the same cloud at the same time though.  One would immediately jump to another cloud when another light came into it's cloud.  It was so awesome to watch this.  My daughter and I couldn't believe what we were seeing.  It was like each light was a ball of electricity moving around in the cloud.  But there was no lightening, no thunder, no dark clouds, no storm at all.  The clouds started to loose their density and their individual shapes.  The clouds were thinning out and started to join together into one ball of mist when we noticed the lights were starting to run into each but would bounce off in opposite directions as soon as they touched.  It was like they were magnets with the polarities repelling each other.  We have no idea what we were watching but we were both very disappointed when the lights stopped.  They didn't fly off they were just gone as the clouds became too misty.  I! t was li ke someone just flicked the light switch off.;53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259

Then all of the sudden a bright white light appeared at the top of the atmosphere and seemed to plummet very fast towards earth, leaving a light trail for the split second that the light was visible.  We only seen the light trail for a very short distance as the light appeared from nothing then trailed very fast downwards for a half a second before disappearing from sight. Judging from the distance we were from the light the light seemed like it was fairly large lit up area.  The skys were clear with some stars visible. I commented something along the lines of what the heck!?  did you see that?  and my wife just as shocked as me agreed that she had seen the light as well. My assumptions would be that it was a meteorite, but it could of been anything.;53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259

I was standing facing west.  I can only describe this object as having looked like a large star or satellite but it was too low in the sky to be either. I initially thought is was a low flying aircraft but did not seen any flashing lights like red, green or white that would be visible on a plane.  It also did not make any sound.  I couldn't hear any engine noise or humming or anything. As it passed directly over me, it suddenly vanished as though the light had been turned off.  I followed its projected path and did not see it again.  I could not see it moving away from me at all.  It just wasn't there. At the time of the sighting, the sky was completely clear with stars clearly visible and the temperature was 9 degrees Celsius.

Bright white light appeared at top of atmosphere then beamed straight down towards the earth in a split second.;2015-11-26 20:00:00;1 second;Bright white light appeared at top of atmosphere then beamed straight down towards the earth in a split second. I may have reported this incident already a couple of days after the event occurred, but since it's been 2 years since the event, I forget if I had reported it here or elsewhere.  I'm reporting the sighting now even in the case I had reported it here 2 years ago, but forgotten that I had.  I tried to report my sighting to several sources but not sure what source was the 'correct' or reliable one.  What I had witnessed that day is still fresh in my mind, as if I had seen it just yesterday and I'm still baffled as to what it was (although I have kind of made up my mind that it was something other worldly). On my way driving home from a evening dinner with my wife, we stopped at an intersection at a red light with no cars in front of us (front of the line) with very possibly no cars behind us and little or no cars going through the intersection.  The sky was clear (no clouds) and dark (black sky).  Then, as if a light switch had flipped on and in the corner of my eye, I noticed a bright white light very high in the sky and off in the distance.  Then in an instant that light seemed to beam directly down towards the ground and did so very quickly and appeared to leave a trail of light as it moved to the ground.  As quickly as the light appeared it had moved towards the earth and disappeared out of sight. There was no sound that I had noticed with the light.  It definitely was not a meteor or something as the way it moved was as if it was 'warp' speed (light really high up in the atmosphere then beamed straight downwards in a straight line towards the ground). I had asked my wife if she had just seen that and she agreed that she did.  It was something that was completely unexpected and left us both in wonder at what we had just witnessed.  My mind immediately thought ufo or aliens but I did try to honestly think if it could of been a natural phenomena, but I couldn't think of anything natural that would match the description of what I had witnessed.;53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259

The light did not move or travel, it just flashed on and off.  I observed the area for another five minutes or so but did not see anything else unusual.  This flash of light was high up with the stars and bigger and brighter than the surrounding stars.  Too high for a drone or helicopter and without the flashing lights of an airplane.

Strange Lights over Edmonton's northern skies [dusk].;2017-02-17 18:00:00;20 minutes;Strange Lights over Edmonton's northern skies [dusk]. We came out of McDonald's when I was drawn toward a bright light, high in the norther sky. I had seen this kind of light before ... I guess that was why I was looking up there.  Venus was visible already [it was pre-dusk] high in the south-west - and that light in the northern sky had about the same magnitude than Venus did that evening.  As we drove home -about a 10 minute drive] we still saw that light, but it soon faded dramatically, only to split into two fainter lights, hovering above each other, then starting to 'dance' around each other [my daughter said 'they are playing tag']. When I ran inside to get the binoculars, the lights were gone ... as there never was anything up there.  Last evening [Februray 21] we saw the same thing again. Same time, same location, same brightness at first. This time I had binoculars at hand, and two neighbours witnessed it too [though, they dismissed it as balloons or something like that]. After waiting about 20 minutes, the light faded again and it split into many tinier lights. The binoculars revealed that the original light was donut shaped, and after fading, the smaller were just light dots, moving erratically, before shooting away in all directions with such speed I could not follow them with the binoculars. I also saw two, what looked like cloud-shapes among the seven tinier lights before they shot away.  I'd like to know what we all saw ... Thanks;53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259

This report is unique from the others in that the orb did something it has not done before that I could see anyway.  I was at work again on Oct. 3, 2017.  It was 2040 hours and I was on a 25 minute layover and was outside.  I was looking toward the West in the sky and i see a bright light approaching me high up.  How high I am not sure.  It seemed to be cloud level perhaps higher.  But when i see the light it is very bright.  This time it flies almost directly over me, but not quite, from a West to East direction. I see the light and zoom in on it with a powerful monocular I purchased.  I see it is the same light orb I have seen previously.  I take out my phone camera and start filming it.  I get about 1 minute or so then my phone goes dead.  I revert back to my monocular and watch the orb continue from West to East.   After a few minutes the orb dims somewhat.  On previous occasions, the orb has traversed the sky till out of sight or veer in a different direction and on 2 occasions it disappeared as I watched it.  This time it did something it has not done before.  It stopped.  The orb came to a stop and ! sat in the same spot for at least 50 minutes.  While I was watching it with the monocular as the orb was still, another light travelled past it perpendicular to the direction the stopped orb was travelling.  The moving light moved south to north just below the stopped orb. 5 minutes later another light did the same thing.  I don't know what those lights were.  If you were to look at the orb that stopped it would appear as a star had you not seen it cross the sky.  I phoned my wife in excitement and some nervousness and told her what I was looking at.  I then filed the report. Conditions in sky were clear with some high cloud cover.  No real wind that I noticed. No sound from object, no trail left behind.  The color of the orb was a bright white light that later dimmed before coming to a stop.  The color if the 2 other lights that crossed the stopped orb were dim white as well. I am a male, 50 years old, married 25 tears with 2 children.  I have a University degree and 2 college diplomas and work full time.;53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259

The light had spike streaks coming off it it was bright I stopped and took my phone out and was accessing my camera so that I could capture some pics but as soon as I put my phone up the bright light went out but there was still a real faint object there just floating motionless and it was to faint to pick up on my camera. After about 2 more minutes the object faded into nothing. I know this was definitely not the Edmonton police chopper it was too strange and motionless and no sound. Was very ! strange.;53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259
