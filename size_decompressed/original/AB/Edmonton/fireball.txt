A green ball of light.;2001-08-27 22:50:00;2 seconds;A green ball of light. I went out onto my balcony for a cigarette and that's when I saw it.  I was leaned up against the banister out on the balcony and started smoking my cigarette.I also had a glass of water in my left hand.  As I'm smoking,I'm looking out into the open straight ahead and all I see is a mall parking lot and my apartment building parking lot. As I went for a sip of water,my head slightly tilted back and my eyes were pointed sort of at the sky.  Right then a green ball of light eminated in front of my eyes. There was a slight cloud coverage and I could recognize a light green haze around it.  So I kept looking on and it started to move to my left and there was no sound and it moved in such a straight line.  It started to accelerate and it disappeared leaving a green trace of light and I have seen lots of planes and this was definately not a regular plane.  When it moved to my left it moved horizantly and not on an angle.  I have seen shooting stars and they go by really quickly and they look white and they don't go by horizantly or slow enough that I could describe what it looked like.  This has been my first sighting ever and it was really exciting and chilling.;53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259
Fireball streaks across night sky, makes right angle turn and disappears.;2010-05-09 02:10:00;8 secs;Fireball streaks across night sky, makes right angle turn and disappears. I was sitting on the deck, looking north, watching for the Northern Lights, about 2:10 AM.  There were a few clouds in the sky.   A glowing orange globular object came out of the eastern sky, from between two clouds.  It moved from east to west in six seconds, then performed a right angled turn to the south and disappeared behind another cloud.   I went in and told my husband about it.  I found a picture on Youtube that looks exactly like what I saw.  This picture was taken by someone else (unknown) in Bolton, Ontario May 18, 2009.;53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259
9 UFO in Edmonton Alberta seen by 3+me From a mechanical engineering student;2012-09-25 20:30:00;5 minutes;9 UFO in Edmonton Alberta seen by 3+me From a mechanical engineering student  500 Lights On Object0: Yes I was outside of my car talking to my friend outside his car so we can get away from our girlfriends.  This is when I noticed 4 orange fireballs in the sky. the were moving together and I thought the were airplane lights as it was dark.  This was when I noticed more coming behind them from the same location that looked like they were all launching off in the far distance of north or northeast edmonton.  They would disappear at different intervals of time and would not follow the exact same vector other than from where they were come from. I was out front of my dads house and my friend and I told our girls to come out and look and they were shocked too.  I am an engineering student at the U of Alberta and I got in trouble with another friend involving drugs and was in jail for the last 5.5 months and found your website on coast to coast as I was shocked to hear other people were seeing the same thing. I believe I was the first to see these things and I hope it he! lps to track their pattern from my submission to your files. They would be moving fast like an airplane and then just stop in the sky and disappear! I think when they launch they have a surge of visible light and when they are in mid air they conserve power and make them less detectable.
