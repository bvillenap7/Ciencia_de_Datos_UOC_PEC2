bright green light changes direction towards earth then is gone.;2001-06-13 01:15:00;5 seconds;bright green light changes direction towards earth then is gone. i live on the top floor of my building and it faces east and south. i was looking out one of the east facing windows when i saw a bright green light flying south in a straight line, at first i thought it was a plane and then all of a sudden it shot very quickly towards the south west in a downward direction with a long ovalish shape with the same bright green colour, then there was a very quick blink in the light then it reappeared on the same course in the same colour but this time the long ovalish shape was a compressed ovalish shape and then just as quickly as it changed its direction it disappeared. this all happend in about five seconds.
