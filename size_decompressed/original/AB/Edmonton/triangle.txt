On July 29, 1987, I saw a UFO at Pigeon Lake (Ma-me-o Beach), Alberta, Canada.  The sky was clear with no wind. My family (husband, daughter, daughter’s friend, mother-in-law, brother-in-law, brother’s friend and I) were vacationing at Ma-Me-O Beach.  We had a cabin on the beach with a firepit in the yard.  About 1:30 AM, my husband, his brother, his brother’s friend and I were sitting around the firepit talking.  Suddenly my brother-in-law said, Look at that!, and pointed up in the sky. Over the lake, at very high altitude, was a large black triangular shape silhouetted against the sky.  It had three lights at the widest point of the triangle, red, white and blue.  They did not blink.  At the speed of a regular plane it went to the middle of the lake, stopped and hovered for what seemed like a few minutes.  It raised itself up and down, and then took off at an incredibly high rate of speed.  It disappeared in a second or two. We talked about it, trying to decide what it was.  My husband is well read on aircraft, and couldn’t match it to any he knew.  Years later we thought it might have been a Stealth bomber on a test run, but the light configuration, manoeuvrability and speed did not match.  Also, what we saw was much larger. I have never forgotten the incident, and it remains clear in my mind to this day.  I still wonder what it was.;53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259

Bright lights, triangular object and a loud sound, Don't know if i am crazy?;2003-03-15 01:00:00;5seconds at a time;Bright lights, triangular object and a loud sound, Don't know if i am crazy? My friend and i were driving around and from no where we sen a bright flash of light and soon after another, this happend close to our homes near Ardrossan then about a half hour later we were near Sherwood Park and sitting in a dead end area when bright flashes of light strobed over us in about 20 second intervoles this happend about 6 to 8 times, we got kinds freaked out but we were both curious so we stuck around, then my friend saw a triangular object just hovering in one spot, thats when we took off, as we drove we heard a loud sound come over us and the bright lights started again. My friend and i are 18 and 17 we don't really know what to think of this, we would tell our other friends but they may think we are crazy, are we? we don't know how to handle this because we also think maybe we might have been taken because we don't remember what we did for a hour of our time.

Two triangular craft;2003-07-15 21:30:00;3 minutes;Two triangular craft I stepped outside of the house for a smoke, and looked up and, almost straight above me at several thousands of feet ( ? ) I saw two triangular shapes, gray in color but with lights.  They were very high up and it was difficult to discern much detail, but there were dots of light within the gray triangles.  They hovered like helicopters, but no sound, and moved in various paths, none of them straight, and whatever the one craft did, the other stayed close, while each performed its own manoever.  They both meandered southward from their initial position which was almost vertically above me. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259

Sitting on my deck having a smoke, Our place at the time was in a new development area...Low lighting.    Our deck faces the South and from the SouthEast Came a V Shape object with What looked like 9 smaller V shapes outlining the Larger wedge with an orange glow on each individual V. The Center of the object seemed transparent but the speed and silence of it was unreal. To this day my roommate still thinks im a kook but I swear I saw it. The factors he threw in my face were it was late summer and the Canadian geese were Taking off before the cold hit...My argument to that was they go South for the winter not North and they make a whack  of noise when they are flying around. Not a single sound of a turbine or anything that you would normally identify an airplane with, If you think im kidding..Whatever but so far in my life my eyes havent failed me yet. Just checking out recent stories on MSN.Com lead me to this site....If it was some kind of Hi-Tech Aircraft then I couldnt tell you what it was doing in Alberta. But I Swear on my life I saw something. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259
Triangular craft clearly seen at night near edmonton with a hollow centre.;2005-11-15 17:30:00;2 minutes;Triangular craft clearly seen at night near edmonton with a hollow centre. i was travelling east down range road 222 and off to my right, i noticed a triangular shaped object with 3 lights. front light was green, rear left was bright red, and rear right was a white light. it was also heading east. then as i turned onto township 520, it made a wide but quick banking 180 left turn. as it was banked, i could see through the middle of it to the other side, as if it had a empty centre /_\, it looked as if it had 3 beams connecting to the lights to form a triangle. it was a bright moon so i could clearly see the outline of the craft.  I didnt really fully believe that ufo's were true, but now i know they are a definite possiblility. this was not a plane or anything normal.;53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259
Pinkish verticle beam of light. 2 bright pulsating orbs and then a triangular shaped object with a hollow centre. Completely silent;2014-04-30 23:45:00;15 minutes;Pinkish verticle beam of light. 2 bright pulsating orbs and then a triangular shaped object with a hollow centre. Completely silent We were sitting outside as the weather was so warm and pleasant.  We have a habit of looking at the stars and trying to pick out planets.  We noticed a pinkish reddish beam of light to the north east.  It  didn't move and sometimes stretched a bit higher.  I was looking to its right and  saw an object white in color get very very bright staying in one spot and then disappearing.  Somewhat how a lighthouse light would fade in and out.  We don't live near any ocean whatsoever.  He however did not see that.  A few minutes of watching it some more he looked in the sky and saw the exact thing I had seen but to the left of the vertical beam.  We really didn't think much of the whole thing thinking it might have been satellites.  All of a sudden I looked over my shoulder to the right was this massive triangularly shaped object.  It made no sound and had a tremendous speed.  It appeared red when I caught his attention and faded to a dark with white lines.  The triangle  had a ! hollow centre and perfectly symmetrical.  It roughly disappeared into where the shaft of light was.  A few minutes later the shaft of light disappeared as we'll.;53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259

They moved very fast and were in sync, moving left to right up and down very fast.  They would disappear and reappear. I was in a Canadian tire parking lot and witnessed this with two other people, it  might sound crazy.. but it almost felt like they knew, I was watching.;53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259
Triangle of pulsating lights (plus 2 below).  Lights appeared towards the tail end of the storm clouds.;2016-07-15 20:10:00;4-6 minutes;Triangle of pulsating lights (plus 2 below).  Lights appeared towards the tail end of the storm clouds Was looking north east at fast approaching storm clouds.  Noticed a bright light, thinking it was a plane. It was to early in the evening for stars.  Continued watching mostly for the storm clouds.then noticed another Light.  Then 3 more. They were pulsating lights whith a auora  around them.  Similar to a light from a flashlight.   Three which were in a triangle form.  Which from a distance would have had to have been 1/4- 1/2 mile apart.  The other lights seemed to come out of the lower lights in the triangle.  And sat below the triangle.  Approximately the same distance apart as the 3 in the triangle. The lights would appear and disappear separately due to the clouds. When they moved it was in unison. Either up or down ,side to side etc. The lower lights would move similarly.  They also could have been in triangular form.  Though may not have seen a third light due to the clouds. I have not seen planes or helicopters move in this manner, which is why I felt I should report the incident.;53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259

11/06/19 19:25 Edmonton, AB Triangle 2 minutes UFO flying southwest 500 feet above the ground with white and red blinking lights;2019-11-06 19:25:00;2 minutes;11/06/19 19:25 Edmonton, AB Triangle 2 minutes UFO flying southwest 500 feet above the ground with white and red blinking lights On November 6, 2019 in Edmonton, Alberta in the Ritchie neighbourhood near Whyte Avenue at approximately 19:25 I was driving home and I saw a triangle shaped UFO. I was driving southbound and when I stopped at a stop sign I saw what at first appeared to be a very low flying helicopter.  This is what I first assumed because I live near a large ravine called Mill Creek Ravine and there are often police helicopters in this area at night. It looked strange to me so I turned off the radio and rolled down my window to see if I could hear the flying object, but there was no sound.  I continued to drive southbound slowly to follow the flying object.  It was about 500 feet above the ground and it was heading southwest. I turned westbound towards my house and I could see it flying further west. It appeared to have an almost wavy hovering motion that was very smooth and there were three white lights, one on each corner, and one red light in the center of the triangle shap! ed craft. The lights appeared to be blinking. After parking on my block I got out of the car to see it, but it was moving too far and my visual was lost within the surrounding trees.;53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259

As we both looked at the dipper I saw the triangle.  no lights, almost fully blended into the night sky.  As I watched puzzled she said ((What)) is that confirming what she had seen (exact same thing) craft didn't seem to be moving fast by panned the visible sky between the  buildings within 5 seconds.;53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259
Grey Triangle appears out of the black sky, descends and moves east accelerating at a phenominal rate.;2020-09-08 02:00:00;10 seconds;Grey Triangle appears out of the black sky, descends and moves east accelerating at a phenominal rate. Looked up at the sky, noticed the stars were bright.  I was fixated on one particular spot that had nothing, just black, no stars.  Went and grabbed my glasses from inside and looked up at that same spot.  Out of nowhere a grey triangle ( i could see the figure very well as the moon was low and behind the trees to the east) appeared and descended down, not pointing down but floating or hovering on a horizontal plane with the vertex point facing east.  It was very high up, at least a kilometer, as the moon made the bottom very detailed.  It had no lights, just 1 protuding rounded discs at each corner.  It then moved east and accelerated extremely fast following the curvature of the earth until it dissapeared.  Could not believe what I had just witnessed.  No sound, no lights or trails.  Just moved, accelerated like nothing I have ever seen before.;53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259
