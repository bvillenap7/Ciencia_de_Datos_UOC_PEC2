Lots of different ufo sightings and unexplainable pictures all in one long night.;1993-09-08 23:30:00;4-5 hours;lots of different ufo sightings and unexplainable pictures all in one long night. We noticed a very bright star like object we watched it and and it didn't do anything strange.  So we went inside and came back out shortly after to check again this time it had looked like it had moved.   So we kept watching it.  It then started moving in zigzag movements very fast across the sky.   We called friends to see if they could see it but they could not see it from where they were in the city and said there was too much of a haze in the sky.   We started video taping it and watching around the sky we then noticed that there seemed to be many other dimmer smaller lights around 10-15 around it that looked like stars but all of they were moving around in similar movements like the big one.   Then we seen a object that looked like a tube shoot across the sky leaving a sort of redish trail and then looked like it burst into flames and disappeared.   We sat in the car in front of the house watching this go on for an hour.   All of a sudden my brother looked out his window and coming from over top of his house and right over top of us is what we thought was a helicopter at first but it made no sound and then when it flew over us it was about 50 feet in the air and looked like nothing I've seen before.  I didn't get a very good look at it except for the back which was big and triangle shaped and had three big red lights in a triangle on the back.   Within a matter of 5 seconds of trying to get my phone out and getting video turned on it had shot off and I just caught the back end of it in the distance leaving.  My brother was taping when it first flew over but right when he turned to look at it with video.  His phone then shut off.  When he turned it back on it still had 20% battery and shut off for no reason.  We noticed red beacon type lights around the trailer park about 6 we found when we went driving around they were about 15 feet high and flashing in a weird manner and really bright (to bright and short to be airplane signal towers) when we! tried to find them and get close they would not be where we seen them its like they would just disappear.  I took a picture of one of them to show height and brightness of one.  I seen something unexplainable in the picture.  It was what looks like a big gold ship that's hovering right beside the beacon you can only see the front of it cause of a street light that seems to be revealing it.  But you can also see a bit of the side of it and see what looks like a wing faintly in the darkness the gold ship must be atleast 60t high.  It goes up higher than I can catch in the picture.  We could not see it in when we were just driving around looking for the beacons.   We went back to my brother's and went inside cause the fog was way to thick to see much else you could not see the moon at all and the fog was hovering 10 feet above the ground.  Just sitting still.  We sat inside in awe from everything we just encountered but of course just second guessed ourselves if we actually just seen what we did.;53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259

Each craft had a row of lights that blinked in sequence from left to right. they were flying very slow and made no sound. I watched them fly in a straight line away from me for about 6 or 7 minutes untill they were completley out of sight.;53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259
