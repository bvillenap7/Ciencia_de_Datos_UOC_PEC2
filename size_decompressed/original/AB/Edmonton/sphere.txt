Blue lights seen dancing in the clouds over downtown Edmonton;2009-04-12 01:00:00;10 seconds;Blue lights seen dancing in the clouds over downtown Edmonton I spotted 3 blue lights moving in a rotational pattern over downtown Edmonton at approximately 1 pm on April 12, 2009.  I was standing on my West facing balcony located near Grant MacEwan College when I noticed the lights.  An unusual, large, circular cloud was directly over the city and lights were positioned in the center, and densest part of the cloud.    At first I thought they were air traffic beacons, but there movements were irregular and seemed to be coming from within the cloud.  There were 4 large lights which rotated in formation and then came together.  Another smaller blue sphere joined them when they came together.   Then suddenly, like someone had switched off a light, they disappeared.  It all happened so fast I hardly had time to realize what was going on before they were gone.  I’m not positive about the number but think there was five lights in total.  My view was also partially obstructed by the above balcony.   Within an hour following the sighting the cloud cover had broken up completely.  I also spotted a helicopter circling the area within an hour following the sighting;53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259
3 orange orbs traveling/pausing east to west over north Edmonton.;2014-08-24 22:13:00;6 minutes;3 orange orbs traveling/pausing east to west over north Edmonton. 3 orange fire ball objects, as often described on Rense Radio, we're observed. This is a first sighting of such, for both of us. I was fumbling and unable to get a useful video or still. Girlfriend (driving) had new glasses on, and swerved over to the wrong side of the road & stopped. I did not have glasses available, but could squint. Orbs lazily moved east to west, with long pauses, some wobbles, & course corrections. If not for meandering & pauses, at maximum speed, the objects could have covered 90 degrees of arc overhead in 30 seconds. At arms length, orbs were less than 2 milimeter wide. Yes, not a close event. Two orbs were accompanying each other, following in line.  On the same trajectory the third was observed within a minute. Last object apparently dimmed its illuminosity out as I was attempting to film.  Girlfriend could still see it though, in front of the the cloud. This was not a particularly spectacular sighting. Height stayed above horizon at 30 degrees approximated. 2 other suv vehicles were also apparently stopped & observing. Upon approach, the other observers drove off. Following the event, (municipal?) helicopters circled the general area for at least an hour. Perhaps this was creation of plausible deniability. Helicopters were loud & relatively low.  Orbs were unheard or noiseless.;53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259
7 objects on video footage recorded with a drone during daytime full HD video available.  ((NUFORC Note:  Not ufos, we suspect?  PD));2016-10-10 13:30:00;5 seconds;7 objects spotted on video footage recorded with a drone during day time full HD video available Drone video recorded in Parkland County at Hasse Lake in Alberta, Canada I was recording some video footage of top of trees trying to capture the fall colors, and I did just that. Later on while showing a friend of mine the video from my drone I have noticed objects in my film that were unusual, I loaded the video into video editing software and went frame by frame and to my surprise I have seen spheres of light ? going extremely fast below my drone, then one came with in feet of the drone passing it at very high speed. The original videos are uploaded into drop box account, the initial video that I released is located on youtube under the link below. https://youtu.be/D_CZghp1c9k  I am extremely interested to figure out what did my camera actually recorded. ((NUFORC Note:  We have viewed the video, and seriously doubt that the objects, which are very difficult to discern, are UFOs.  They are very small, it appears, and we wonder whether they might be insects or seed pods, flying past the object lens of the video camera.  PD));53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259
Melon sized black solid orb flying through sky below clouds mayne 50 m in the air.;2017-09-27 16:00:00;2 minutes;Melon sized black solid orb flying through sky below clouds mayne 50 m in the air. On September 27, at 1600 hrs., I was at work on a short layover at the University of Alberta, relaxing and stretching my legs in a parking lot.  It was a sunny day with moderate cumulous clouds.  I was looking up and a small melon sized black orb appeared and flew above me and past me in a southerly west direction.  It flew by at about 60 km hour and traversed a wide arc until I lost sight of it.  It made no noise and had no wings or anything particular aside from it being a black melon sized sphere or orb.  It seemed solid to me. The unusual thing about the sighting was my ability to see it flying in the air when it was so far away from me.  It had to be over 2 miles away but yet i could still see it.  I thought that was odd.  It eventually flew where i could no longer see it. I am a 50 year old male.  A University graduate with a BSc. degree as well as a Technical college degree and 2 year Diploma in Bible Theology from a Saskatchewan college.  Married for 25 years with 2 children.  Work full time.;53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259
