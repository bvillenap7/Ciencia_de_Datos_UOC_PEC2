Suddenly,a formation of 7 or 8 boomerang or arrowhead shaped objects appeared,flying north to south,from over our garage roof. The appearance was so striking and strange that each of us instinctively jumped out of our chair and actually stumbled over one another to get a longer look before they disappeared over our house and into the distance. They disappeared incredibly fast despite their altitude,we just looked at each other and said did you see that? They were brighty lit in a way I would describe as similar to a child's glowstick (white),appeared to be flying in synch with one another,in a V or L shaped formation,and appeared to be part of or lights on a larger transparent object. It appeared to be flying an altitude approximately that of a helicopterlower than a commuter plane. I am considerably versed in existing and historical military aircraft, but this one has me baffled. It is definately a UFO sighting in my books.;53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259
