The black ball then seems to go strait up and totally out of site.;2007-02-19 16:00:00;4 mins;On February 19 at around 16:00 hrs, my son and i were walking home from the store when my son stopped and pointed at what looked like contrails in the south west sky.   I looked up to see three contrails, that looked like thy where going strait up from the ground. And moving vary fast. We stood there looking for about 2mins when we seen what looked like three explosions in the upper atmosphere, at this point the contrails stopped both my son and I gasped when we seen what looked like a large black round ball hanging in the air just above the explosions. The black ball then seems to go strait up and totally out of site. My son looked at me and said I wish we had a camcorder to catch that, I said to him when I get home ill call the police to see if there was a plain collision to try to explain it. So when I got home I did just that the officer that I was talking to said there was no plain crashes or collisions at that time. But there was to be a meteor shower that day and that is what We must have seen, I know in my hart and my son to that what we seen was no meteor shower that day.;53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259
A HUGE U.F.O..;2007-06-21 00:00:00;15 minutes;A HUGE U.F.O. I remember being so tired after doing my exercise routine of approximately two hours and being late at night,around midnight as that was mostly the case back then.I needed some fresh air and to cool down after my dance routine.I opened my back door and was about to step onto the deck when I noticed an object so very huge that it stopped me in my tracks and I just stood there staring at it!The object unbenounced to me, was like nothing I had ever dreamed or imagined before!It was &quotparked&quot in my back yard and in the sky!It was also so close to the ground that in describing it and it's size is undeterminable and I could only take a guess as to its dimensions! It was &quotHuge&quot and round in shape and was as dark as the midnight sky except for the lights underneath.I could definately not see the top of this humungous monstrocity of a &quotSpace Vehicle&quot as was told to me by my report of it to &quotMUFON&quot that it was a U.F.O sighting! ! All I could do was stare in amazement at this U.F.O. parked in my backyard sky! &quotThis has got to be a Hoax&quot and someone playing a mind game with me! Someone making a very expensive movie also came to mind that night! This is definately not &quotreal&quot as I looked for a beam radiating a hologram and could see none.It was so close as if I picked up a rock and threw it at it would have hit it.It was the most amazing thing that I have ever seen or experienced and something that will remain in my memory!Except now I don't recall the color of the &quotlights&quot on it.Blue and red and yellow-I think!And there were three or four-I think! I almost immediately wanted to put it out of my mind that night as I was feeling the best I've ever felt physicaly and mentaly in a long time and a peacefulness like no other time in my life and did not want to spoil that feeling by a &quotsighting&quot! A sighting that I never asked to see or dreamed of seeing or whatever th! e case or cause might have been! I went to bed after standing ! and look ing at it!Why me?? and why after all these years would I have to experience this enomaly?Me??Not good with people as one of my friends that could not play guitar in public,not good with people due to whatever reason.Shy introverted people and another reason that I tried to dismiss the event as to not have to explain to anybody or deal with &quothuman&quot emotions in any way.So my friend and I had this in common,now he has passed on and never to see or talk to again! As with most important and influential people in my life and just drift away from me!People I don't care for seem to be always there!Just like that &quotGod-damned&quot &quotSpaceship&quot!!Writing about it may or may not &quothelp&quot and reporting it took a lot of guts!Where's the &quotGlory&quot in that?

Luminous circular orb disappears into nothing.;2014-06-01 00:30:00;4 seconds;Luminous circular orb disappears into nothing Stepping outside my front door, I glanced to the south and saw a large luminous circle which quickly after I looked at it seemed to move in an eastward direction.  As it moved it seemed to go behind something, as it gave the appearance that the circle and light were disapperaing behind something.  There did not appear to be anything else there.  It was a clear night with some clouds, but none where I saw the circle.;53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259
Daylight sighting of multiple objects over Edmonton, AB-recorded on two devices by family at park.;2015-07-20 09:15:00;25;Daylight sighting of multiple objects over  Edmonton AB -  recorded on two devices by family at park. On 2015-07-20 at approximately 09:05 hrs my family and I were at Glengarry Park in NE Edmonton, AB.  My children were playing on the kids equipment and I was speaking with my wife while keeping a watchful eye on them.  The weather was mainly sunny/clear with a few clouds and approximately 20 degrees Celsius. I happened to look up in the sky, which was very bright from the sun.  Something caught my eye and I focused in on what I can only describe as an object which appeared very high in the sky.  I watched as the object appeared to be still, bright white, and not moving.  I could not make out a shape but it appeared very bright and circular.  I quickly pointed and told my wife to look up, which she did.  She was able to focus in on the object quite quickly.  A moment later, we both noticed the object was not alone.  At first we both observed 2 more objects which between the 3, formed a triangle.  Then I observed a fourth object to the left of the triangle, and then another to the right.  The objects began moving to the NE at varying speeds.  At this time, I noticed one of the objects appeared to go from a bright white to a bluish color, and another from white to a hint of orange. Throughout the event, most of the objects appeared to go in and out of focus.  At times we had to look away and then back in order to find them again.  One object though (the first one I saw) was always easy to spot.  In fact, this was the only object that decreased altitude and came significantly lower than the others (this happened about 5 minutes after first spotted). My wife and I estimated approximately 7-9 objects were seen during the event which lasted approximately 25 minutes.  During the event my wife and I attempted multiple short video recordings on our IPhone devices.  At the time, we did not think the camera was picking up the objects as we could not see them on the screen.  The glare from the sun and reflection on the screen made it impossible to see anything.  We did our best guesses in pointing though and upon review found some clear footage of one of the objects and a faint view of at least two more.  She was also able to zoom in on the clearest object but found it would not focus. At one point during the event, while observing the object and preparing my camera to take another recording, I noticed a passenger jet travelling in the direction of the clearest object.  I was able to get a recording of the object and jet in close proximity to each other.  It appeared the plane was lower in altitude but it's difficult to say for sure. Both my wife and I have never seen anything like this before.  The objects would change directions in an instant and appeared to go from very fast (faster than the jet) to not moving at all.  We also noticed the objects were making various triangle formations as the moved.  As well, at no time did we observe a jet stream or anything emitting from the objects.  The park where the event occurred is approximately 10 km SW of Canadian Forces Base Edmonton on the north end of the city. Our backgrounds, I am a retired police officer and my wife is a teacher. We are very interested in having this video analyzed to find out what we saw on this day.;53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259
Circular glowing white craft travelling across sky makes impossible turn.;2017-09-17 10:55:00;3-5 minutes;Circular glowing white craft travelling across sky makes impossible turn. On the morning of Sunday, September 17th, our family was at church as is our custom.  It was 1055 AM, and I poured myself a coffee in the foyer, then went outside to the steps of the church.  It was a sunny clear blue sky with a few scattered clouds.   Looking up to the north, a bright glowing circular or perhaps egg shaped UFO appeared, travelling in a south easterly direction in a straight path below cloud level.  While I was watching it the UFO made an impossible turn at a 45 degree angle and proceeded in a straight path eastward until out of sight.  The UFO seemed to going about 100 to 200 km/hr.  There was a fellow coming into the church and he saw the object as well. The main witness (myself) is a University graduate with a BSc and Technical college graduate as well as a graduate in Bible Theology from a Saskatchewan Bible College.  I work full time and have been married 25 years and have 2 children.;53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259

I thought he was nuts.   I looked away for a couple minutes to tell my husband then realized the Moon was on the other side of the house.  When i looked back it moved over a few houses, then disappeared.  It was in Millwoods/Edmonton, going southeast.  Round and large greyish white and looked exactly like the moon.  So weird. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Hi again i would have to say it was the apparent size of the moon. And this happened at 9:15 am.  ((END ADDENDUM));53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259
