Objects & Beams of Light in Symetrical Pattern Fly across the sky.;1980-06-15 00:00:00;5 min;Objects & Beams of Light in Symetrical Pattern Fly across the sky. At 33 years old, I still think about my experience often.  I was only 11 when in 1980 (?) something really wonderful was about to be experienced...a UFO sighting.  It's as clear to me now as it was 22 years ago.  Was I dreaming? Seeing an illusion? Was it a meteor or a meteorological event?  I'm certain it was not!  How can I be so certain?  I was with a friend who also saw everything.  We ran home to our parents to tell the story.  The next day, Edmonton radio and newspapers claiming the phone lines were choked with similar testimony gave us credibility.  Representatives from the University, (who never witnessed the event), explained it as a possible meteor.  So here is what really happened... Armed with a pair of binoculars, it was a clear summer starry night when my friend ((name deleted)) and I set out to star gaze.  While break and enters where the hobbies of kids our age, we enjoyed astronomy. We actually wrote papers on the planets and studied the constellations. Call us geeks, but we found it exciting.  Facing the northern sky, we settled into the side of a hill not far from my house where lights could be dodged. My parents were stationed in Edmonton for a 5 year term. Life on the Greisbach army base was, to say the least, boring, so the patience we had learned was about to be rewarded.  After about 40 minutes of just laying there, I happened to take interest at a red star in the east. I pointed it out to ((2nd witness)) to get his opinion. Although we both agreed it was just a star, I still kept a wary eye on it. It wasn't long before I was asking ((2nd witness)) to confirm if the star was moving.  It seemed to be growing!  Awww...just a plane we decided.  He went back to gazing at other objects.  A few moments passed and I nudged him asserting that it was no plane.  Now we were both watching intently.  Then the most peculiar thing happened.  A beam of light grew from it.  Our mouths were fixed open in awe.  I fumbled with my click camera, but was more interested in taking in the event.  The beam of light grew long across the sky as it moved at a constant rate from east to west, well above the horizon, but not overhead. The distance was difficult to judge, but it seemed far yet near.  Kind of like a Las Vegas building. They look near because they are so big.  As it stretched across the north in front of us, stranger things appeared.  Two stars appeared on each side of the beam, and then another two, and then another two. Then all stars did the same thing the original beam did.  They stretched out thinner beams in front of them.  The beams had bright lights at each end.  They were positioned perfectly symmetrical.  The middle beam was bigger than the surrounding beams.  When the event was directly in front of us, again each of the smaller beams were surrounded by stars which then shot out their own beams.  Now as the event passed into the west, (which still had a bit of twilight), it did the exact reverse!  Small beams collapsed into stars and into single beams and then the last big beam collapsed back down to a star which eventually winked out.  The main event had lasted for only a minute, but it seemed longer. Chris and I looked at each other in excitement.  We stayed there for another half hour hoping for more.  Our excitement got the better of us and we ran home to tell all!  If anyone else has seen and remembers this, please contact me (email address below).  I would like to compare notes.  Also, I can't remember the exact date but I would love to search the newspaper archives for this event.  Its possible the army was experimenting with some sort of transportation device But as I let my imagination take over, I think we witnessed an alien space probe passing by our planet on a planned mapping of our solar system.  Think of it like a car coming down the road. At first you see a small dot, then it grows into a front and then as it passes you see the long side of it and then the backside and finally a receding dot.  In this case the front was like looking at the end of a fiber optic cable and as it passed it looked like the whole fiber.  Its so hard to put into words, but it was an incredibly FANTASTIC event to witness. Whatever it was, it was VERY BIG!  If you ask ((2nd witness)) today, he thinks it was just a meteor.  I saw some very cool big meteors with a long sparkly death, and nothing in that shower could even come remotely close to what we saw. It was NOT a meteor. Meteors do NOT have symmetry! Nor do they fill up the sky.  But there was no doubt that it was NOT a meteor.  I had seen them before, this in contrast looked alien, moved slowly across the entire sky, and behaved mechanical.  I also forgot to add that there was supposedly a very low engine rumble.  I can't remember if I experienced this or if I got this from the reports the next day.  Like I said, we were too transfixed, all other non-visual senses seemed to be halted.  I should also state that we were NOT under the influence of anything... we were eleven!  I have better things to do then tell wild stories. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length via telephone with this witness, and he seemed exceptionally lucid and objective to us.  We suspect that he is an excellent witness, in part, because he is an amateur astronomer.  Please see his other report for February 28, 2004, also from Edmonton, AB.

Orange Ball;2004-02-22 21:30:00;30 minutes?;i live on a acreage outside of edmoton object was WEST it was a glowing ball in the air, far off in the distance, i can only guess becuase it was a light but i dont think it was THAT far from the ground. about 9:30 im heading upstairs from my basement, were i pass our main entrance door which has a large window, and i saw a light, a orange ball, which looked like one of thoes streetlamp from a distance, i really wanted to keep my eye on this object but I had more important things to do, yet i still manage to check on the object every 5 or so minutes, and it remained there. at around 9:50pm. i look outside once again and the object WAS GONE, i was shocked and disapointed, very disapointed that i didnt get to see it move! about 10 minutes later, hoping to see it again, i look out the window once more, and THERE IT WAS , only it was now a great distance further to the left and it was either farther away or closer to the ground. dying to get a closer view of it with binocolors and from past the banches of my trees, i rushed to get my coat and binocolors, but when i got outside I WAS GONE... i was so disapointed! im turning into a really big UFO buff, and im so disapointed that i could not of veiwed this object longer! or for that mater see it move.  additional remarks: the object seemed to have a slight, very slight pulsing of the orange glow, it is a clear night, and the light had no other lights or blinking lights, thus ruling out a air plane or what not, i would also like to add that when i went outside, i heard many dogs barking mad off in the distance or where the light was.;53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259
tight faint formation directly over Edmonton, AB Canada. Going NNW.;2004-03-29 20:45:00;2-3 seconds;tight faint formation directly over Edmonton, AB Canada. Going NNW. I was observing the planets (5 of them visible this evening). While trying to orient myself I saw a four or five faint lights in a tight formation pass directly overhead in a NNW direction. I thought that it might be a plane, a single object but I had a sense that they were separate because the lights were of different intesities. Because of the faintness of the lights they seemed high yet if they were high then they were going FAST! There was no Sonic boom or anything. It was weird! The objects cleared a 90 degree arc in less than three seconds.;53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259
3 or 4 orange round lights with tails in the front, 2 in middle, and 3 or 4 in the back.;2004-05-10 00:30:00;5-10Sec;3 or 4 orange round lights with tails in the front, 2 in middle, and 3 or 4 in the back. I was watching t.v. when lights caught my attention outside of the window.There were 3 or 4 orange round lights with small tails(not nearly as long as a shooting star)in the front. 2in the middle and 3 or four in the back. They were traveling from the west to east at a steady speed, not breaking formation. there was also no sound from this object or objects. i watched them travel across the sky untill i couldn't see them any more. i also stayed up for several hours later watching the sky but haven't seen anything else.;53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259
lights in the north;2004-05-10 00:30:00;5-10Sec;lights in the north I was watching t.v , and some lights caught my attention though my window to the north.these lights were light orange with little tails(not nearly as long as those tails on shooting stars).they were travelling from the west towards the east in formation. 3 in the front, 2 in the middle, and 3 in the back. i went to my window and watched them move without breaking formation, or maiking a noise like an aircraft.;53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259
Silent, fast, low traveling lights fly over Edmonton Sunday night;2004-05-10 00:37:00;20 seconds;Silent, fast, low traveling lights fly over Edmonton Sunday night Approaching Edmonton from the northwest.  At first thought it was a low flying jet but as it got closer I witnessed that there was several lights on it and that it was very large.  Hard to tell exactly how large, could not make out any shape of the craft, just its lights, white in colour and spread out in a clylinder shape.  As it passed by me it appeared to be no more than 2 kms away at most.  If at 2kms it would have been at least 200 meters in lenght. I noticed them approaching quite far in the distance and looked like a single light until it approached closer to me It took only 25 seconds to pass by me from the first light I saw and then clear the horizion where it disapeared in the light reflection of the city.  No sound emmitted from the objects as they passed by, as I expected to hear something with the speed in which they were obviously traveling, guessing 1000 kms per hr plus at minimum. ((NUFORC Note:  One of two similar reports about apparently the same event.  We will forward the reports to Canadian investigators.  PD));53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259
7 objects travelling VERY FAST, changing postions, travelling in formation, and creating no noise.;2004-05-10 00:45:00;20 seconds;7 objects travelling VERY FAST, changing postions, travelling in formation, and creating no noise. At approx 0:45 hours I was laying on my couch looking out a large picture window towards the North East.  All lights in my house were turned off.  I saw what appeared to be a meteor shower in the northwest sky.  Something about the way the lights were travelling made me quickly realize it was not infact meteors.  I went out my front door and looked to the sky where the light were and watched as they moved positions, almost like how birds flying south do.  There appeared to be 7 of the objects moving at about the same speed but changing places.  The creepiest part of the whole experience was that they didn't seem too far off and they where completely silent.  I am involved with jet car racing and know that to attain a speed like what I witnessed would have to involve some sort of afterburning jet engine that would create and incredible amount of noise at that altitude and speed.  I an located just to the east of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada in Sherwood Park and from where I was they appeared to fly from The Fort Saskatchewan area towards the Camrose area.  That is a fairly accurate discription of the sighting.  I hope this helps you, cause I know it helps me even just writing this summary of events (I was a bit creeped out about the sighting) Thank you ((NUFORC Note:  One of two similar reports about apparently the same event.

5 lights, jockeying around to make rectangle, triangle, circle and straight line formations travelling east;2010-08-04 01:40:00;Flyby approx 20 sec.;5 lights, jockeying around to make rectangle, triangle, circle and straight line formations travelling east Standing looking at Northern lights from CME on Aug 1/10. Observing Venus, Saturn, Mars triangle formation to the east when I looked directly overhead and saw 5 small lights (slightly more luminous than the stars) in rectangle formation moving to the east. I thought...What the hell kind of plane is that?.....when they suddenly broke formation, moved around one another for a quick second, like they were jockeying for position, and formed a triangle.  They jockeyed again to form a circle, back to a triangle, a straight line North to South, back to a triangle.....all while travelling East. Approx. 20 sec from when I first saw them...they had moved out of eye view. No sound at all. Best guesstimate of alltitude....possibly ISS alltitude or less.;53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259
Metallic cloud cloaked object made up of three orb shaped components hovering in sky in broad daylight by international airport.;2014-01-16 08:30:00;20 minutes;Metallic cloud cloaked object made up of three orb shaped components hovering in sky in broad daylight by international airport. I was driving my mother to the Edmonton airport and noticed a strange 'cloud' in the sky.  I pointed it out to my mum, asking her what she thought it was.   She said it looked like a cloud.  I said it was too solid, in comparison with the other clouds, and looked like it was reflecting light.  It seemed to be hovering in one spot.   I asked her to take a picture of it with my phone but she couldn't get it to work properly.  As I was driving, I had to wait for an opportunity to pull over.   I managed to get one shot of the object before my phone said I had no storage left.   When I zoomed in on the picture after dropping mum off, I was pretty freaked out.   I sent an email to the Edmonton Journal with the photo but got no response.;53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259

Two lights move towards each other, followed by a complete formation appearing, Edmonton, AB.;2015-04-26 01:00:00;10 minutes;Two lights move towards each other, followed by a complete formation appearing, Edmonton, AB. I am on my days off from working nightshift, and I am unpacking, as I recently moved.  It was about 1:00 AM (01:00HR's) when I was looking out my window wishing I had the lenses for my telescope when I noticed a peculiar star just above the horizon.  It was blinking in a  • • - • • - patter if it was morse code.  Moving from White to red. After looking at it for about a minute, I noticed another smaller object blinking in an on/off pattern moving closer to the first star like object.  I watched it until came to approximately the half way point, form its immediate position.   At that point a formation of red lights appeared in an almost trapezoid pattern.  I then went to grab my dSLR camera with a telephoto lens, by the time I got back the lights and formations where gone. While viewing the objects it almost appeared that the normal shade of horizon lit up.  I looked away and back again to make sure it wasn't something I was hallucinating.  It was a strange experience. There was aircraft following normal commercial flight paths, no other known behaviours.;53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259
Cluster of star like objects moving with incredible speed;2019-08-25 00:12:00;3 seconds;Cluster of star like objects moving with incredible speed I was in my back yard doing some astronomy when motion in the sky caught my attention. I have been doing amateur astronomy for over 25 years, so I'm very familiar with satellites, meteors, etc. When I looked up I could clearly see approximately 7 star like objects moving from northeast to southwest with incredible speed.  They moved from eastern Cygnus to south of Lyra before I lost them behind a tree.  They were all pale bluish white in colour, and all equally bright (approximately magnitude 3).  When I first saw them they were in a partial V formation, like a hockey stick, with a short side (2 objects) and a long side (4 - 5 objects).   As they moved some of them sped up and some slowed down.  Some crossed over the other ones.  They did not leave a trail behind them the way meteors do.  Unlike meteors, their brightness was constant.  They did not flare the way meteors do.  Yet their speed was incredible.  I estimate they were moving approximately 30 degrees per second.  They left no smoke trail behind them and there was no sound.;53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259
