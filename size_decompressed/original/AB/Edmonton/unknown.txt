Two objects with highly intense brilliant white flashes moving slowly north at extremely high altitude in parallel orbit.;2003-09-18 23:00:00;3 Minutes;Two objects with highly intense brilliant white flashes moving slowly north at extremely high altitude in parallel orbit. My Wife and I go into the outdoor hottub every night and we have an unobstructed view of the night sky. Thursday night, we went into the tub and sat looking at the passing satellites going over and we noticed an extremely bright, pure white flash of light in the southern night sky at about 80 Deg. above the horizon. This light flashed and was gone. It suddenly appeared again but had travelled approximately one fist width (held at arms length) in a northerly direction. This light flash on and of at approximately two second intervals for almost 30 seconds then the frequency changed to an erratic flashing that would pause for a second, then flash, then pause for two or three seconds then flash. This continued for another two minutes or so and then it just stopped and disappeared. Then, at the same line of travel, back in the southern sky came a second flash. This one was also at about 80 Deg. above the horizon. This one continued for about one and a half minutes, following the same pattern of erratic flashes and also followed the same north bound path, but it was further to the west of the first object. It also disappeared (stopped flashing) as it passed overhead.  I have been an avid atronomer for over 40 years and can honestly state that this caught my attention in that when I went inside, I got on my computer and hit the Nasa Site - J-Track (Satellite Tracking Software that is available to all) and there were no satellites tracking over our part of Alberta at that time.  I have also been involved in Satellite Tracking of land-based assets and have also participated in the Cobalt Radiation Testing of Chips and related software for the GPS Satellite Constellation Correction and Surveillance Sats Sys that actually tracks and maintains the record of correctional data for the deliniation of the current Glonass and GPS Constellations that are orbiting the earth today. It is not that I do not know what an orbiting satellite looks like as it goes over. THese objects were not satellites or anything that we have sent up. These objects were pulsating at a timed and then erratic rate which indicates a self serving at the time of initiation protocol, not one that is programmed by any standard we use on earth.  I have seen hundreds of Satellites that spin along their axis in their orbit and have witnessed their solar panels flashing as they rotate toward the sun and these flashes that my wife and I witnessed were simply not the flashes caused by the solar panels of satellites being illuminated by the sun. The lights were of such an intensity that they were similar to th star burst flares dropped from aircraft to light up ground positions......only so very much brighter. My wife says they were like looking into the flash of a camera.  Finally, I was travelling west on Saturday morning at 0400 and was listening to you on the radio for that hour and was taken with the fact that someone had seen the exact same lights over Seattle only one or two nights prior to my wife and seeing them over Alberta. Incidently, high orbit travel at any conventional sat speed from Seattle to Edmonton is about 11 minutes or so..............rough of the top of the head reckoning.  I hope this helps you in your project and I can honestly state that this did in fact occur and my wife was and still is, somewhat amazed and left wondering.;53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259
Looking for what i saw i found this site on the internet 5-7 green [lime] and red [huge], huge oval type shape lights traveling from th;2004-05-10 00:00:00;30-40 seconds;Looking for what i saw i found this site on the internet 5-7 green [lime] and red [huge], huge oval type shape lights traveling from the east aross the city of edmonton ,i saw them from possibly 40 miles from edmonton to 40 miles to the west the whole distance i could see from the begining. I work out side all night on midnights for 25 years ive seen it all and have rarely beemn stumped . i was 10 miles north of the city at the time so my overall view was quite good. while traveling west the 4th 0ne overtook the first to either be beside it or just in front its hard to tell? but the speed of ecelleration from one point of that light to its final position in the group must be in the thousands of miles an hour with a click of your thumb! we have a military base to the north land and air a littel farther ie:coal lake so ive seen what we got up their if this is ours we have nothing to worry about ,but somehow i think we do .  the enite distance i feel i had seen these lights travel must have been 100-150 miles in under 30 seconds closer to 20 secs.;53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259

What is this?;2005-07-24 15:54:00;instantanious;What is this? We were crossing the bridge in our car and there was nothing there, we were taking a picture of the cityscape with a sony digital camera.  The object is over the river to the left of the bridge.  When the picture was taken we saw nothing in the frame.  When we got home we noticed the object in the picture.  We would like to know what it is.  Do you know?;53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259
intensely bright, unmoving object suddenly goes dim;2007-06-06 03:30:00;10 - 15 seconds;intensely bright, unmoving object suddenly goes dim I saw a very bright orange light in the southern sky, in the same area as where i have been observing a planet that is visible earlier in the evening (it's white, i think it is Jupiter or Venus). The light was brilliant, it reminded me of a glowing gem. I was thinking that I should go and get my telescope when it suddenly began to get dimmer. A short while later it was barely noticeable and it looked like a very distant orange star. It did not seem to be moving at all. It was about 10 or 15 seconds from dazzling light to nothing. Just as it winked out, the Police chopper, Air 1, flew past my location going North. I noticed that it also has an orange light on it along with the blinking blue and red flashers. It also makes quite a bit of noise, the object I saw did not make any sound at all. I had the feeling that it simply just turned out it's light.;53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259
Edmonton Alberta Canada, Huge object W/ Flashing lights closer then planes, helicoptors or even hot air balloons. approx 7 pm DEC 22;2007-12-22 19:00:00;3 secs;Edmonton Alberta Canada, Huge object W/ Flashing lights closer then planes, helicoptors or even hot air balloons. approx 7 pm DEC 22 On about that night stated above, Ben my son and I were waiting for a bus.  It was approx. 7pm. relatively a clear night.  We were just talking and happened to be on opposite sides of street looking for any signs of a bus coming from any direction, when clear as can be, an object appeared and disappeared.  It was huge!  In addition, it made no sound at all.  In a particular site we gave seen five other sightings of the same thing over the last 1 1/2 years.  Seems to be on the same path.  It appears and disappears with never ever any sound.  Only the last to times it has been closer where you can see the lights flashing strobe like.  It just disappears! We like the sky, we like watching for planes, stars, satellites ECT.  In addition, if you look way up in the sky, beyond the stars almost...you can see the satellites moving but we have seen objects moving in straight lines and back at record speeds.  I know their are allot of satellites but these seem to be moving strangely.  I did not know this site existed, or I would have written along time ago.  There are ufo's out there, and their are closer then ever now.  How could two people see the same thing?? At the same time?  The government has found out a way to have these flying objects now and fly them around to be unselective for future wars.  Alternatively, another country has made the ship that disappeared many years ago, actually traveled in time but not without major problems and skepticism.  Also on our computers and on our TV, witch is all 2 years old.  Are picking up signs.  Someone said it is just other satellites passing by, but then why are we not hearing it none stop.  I think the plane that hit a” air pocket” last week in B.C. was probly on top of a ufo.  Skidding on top with out knowing it was there.  Because all the ones we have seen, they have appeared and disappeared, witch means they can become invisible at any given time. Some one knows and has had contact with them. Why else are they appearing more and more around the world?  More then ever.  How can we take a picture of them when they move so fast and so quietly?  I am freaked!

Very often, we hear u.f.o. s make no sound af all, this one did.;2015-01-07 20:00:00;10 seconds;Very often, we hear u.f.o. s make no sound af all, this one did. At 20:00 MST this evening, I was lying down, when suddenly I heard a sound outside.  It was oscillating and loud.  It lasted about 10 seconds.  Then it abruptly stopped.  I saw no lights through the curtains, nothing to indicate what was there, or if it left or not.  I can think of nothing that could make that sound.  And there were no other noises, or engine sounds. I'm retired, but I have a science background, and I have a lot of experience studying the sky.
