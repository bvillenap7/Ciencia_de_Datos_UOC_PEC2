Image caught by accident in Millwoods;2009-08-18 14:05:00;none;Image caught by accident in Millwoods I was taking pictures of a passing storm and hoping to get lightning or a tornadoe cloud and when I downloaded the images to my laptop I seen a couple of specs in the images. They were the same craft I think, and appears to be a oval silver or silver topped disk. I took the images to Adobe and blew the specs up to a size that it would allow before heavy distortion. Then I made this video of the images. I took one hundred and twenty three images, this object was in only two. I could not see it when I took the pictures.

AT AN ELEVATION OF ABOUT 30 DEGREES AND BINOCULAR FOCUS SET FOR STAR GAZING, A LARGE, POINTED ON BOTH ENDS, OVAL SHAPE, LIGHT COLORED, APPEARED AND WENT HORIZONTALLY FROM RIGHT TO LEFT. NO DETAILS OR MARKINGS SEEN AS IT APPEARED TO BE FAIRLY NEAR AND NOT IN GOOD FOCUS. TRAVEL SPEED WAS VERY FAST, RIGHT TO LEFT ACROSS THE BINOCULAR FIELD IN LESS THAN ABOUT 1/2 SECOND. AS AN AMATEUR ASTRONOMER FOR OVER 60 YEARS, I HAVE SEEN A NUMBER OF UNEXPLAINED OBJECTS. THIS OBJECT WAS DEFINITELY NOT TERRESTRIAL. MANY YEARS AGO I SAW AN OBJECT APPEAR AND DESCEND VERTICALLY AND MAKE A 90 DEGREE TURN TO HORIZONTAL WITH NO CHANGE IN SPEED AND DISAPPEAR , AGAIN IN LESS THAN A SECOND.
