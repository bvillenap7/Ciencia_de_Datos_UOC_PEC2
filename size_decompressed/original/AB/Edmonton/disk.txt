Huge, motionless craft hovers silently above an army base;2002-07-06 01:30:00;10 seconds;Huge, motionless craft hovers silently above an army base It was approximately 1:30 am on a clear summer night and my boyfriend was driving me home. We took the usual route, which is right alongside an army base which is surrounded by a thick border of trees. We were on the right side of the street and the army base and trees were to my right. I was looking up at the sky through my (passengers) window as we drove along and out of nowhere, I spot a huge disc-shaped object. It was hovering, motionless in the field of the army base at just the right angle and height above the trees for me to get a good look at it. The top portion was dome shaped and appeared slightly lighter in colour than the bottom and did not have any lights on it's surface. The lower portion of the object was shaped like a saucer but had some thickness to it. It was dark in colour and the flat bottom was encircled with red and pale yellow lights at it's edge. There was a long, rectangular ramp extended from the bottom part and I could see a cable or something cable-like, holding this ramp in place. The ramp was not in contact with anything else in the sky, it was just there and the light inside the object was light grey, almost misty. I started to yell what the f*ck is that?!!! and kept telling him to look and asking him if he seen it too. I kept repeating it's in the sky, above the trees! and he tried to lean over to see it, but the roof of the car was obstructing his line of sight. I was too excited to think of getting him to pull over, even though the streets were almost empty and we probably could have done so safely. For the next few seconds, I just watched this huge, silent object hover in the sky, and as we kept driving, I lost sight of it. I told ((name deleted)) to turn pull a u-turn and go back, so that he could see it. But by the time we got to the other side of the road and retraced our path, it was gone.;53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259
Small disk with blue light;2002-08-04 00:01:00;30 seconds;Small disk with blue light I had just gotten work, and was waiting at a bustop.  I heard an odd buzzing noise, and looked up to see a small silver disk floating several feet above me.  I could not define the size of the craft, as it appeared to be both near and far away.  The object jutted back and forth and moved EXTREMELY fast in different directions.  After doing so it sort of blinked a blindingly blue light and shot straight into the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  We presume that the sighting occurred on Sunday morning, August 4, 2002.  It may have occurred on the morning of Monday, August 5th.  PD));53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259
insane.  ((anonymous report));2014-10-20 11:20:00;3 minutes;insane. I moved to Edmonton three and a half years on November 1.  I lived across the road to a macs convience store as well as a pizza hut and subway.  My boyfriend was away for work so i was going to go grab some wine at the liquor store down the road, but was going to grab some smokes first.   As i walked out of tthe store, i headed around the building to go towards the liquor store.  I suddenly heard this sound like a planee was about to crash on me, so loud i plugged my ears.  I looked up and nothing was there, as well as behind me.   I kept starring at the sky with my ears plugged and didn't know where it was coming from.  Then in my vision above me appeared this giantic ship.  It covered the entire sky.  There were no lights and it was very faint, but enoiugh to make it out.  It then took off so fast and vanished in the distance.  I ended up throwing up because i couldnt believe it.

Wobbling disk UFO appears in sky travels westward for 5 minutes.;2017-10-16 18:22:00;5 minutes;Wobbling disk UFO appears in sky travels westward for 5 minutes. Disk UFO  I was at work on Monday Oct.16, 2017 driving south on 127 street Edmonton.  I was stopped at the Yellowhead/127 street intersection looking forward and up in the cloudy sky.  There was nothing there and then suddenly this object appeared about 400 to 500 meters up under the clouds south of me about 1 kilometer I estimate.  It was moving oddly and immediately got my attention.  I keep a powerful monocular in my carry bag behind my seat and while I was stopped at the intersection I reached for it and zoomed in on the object.  It was disk shaped and black and was moving in a westerly direction at about 60 km/hr.  The light turned green at the intersection and I had to drive south but kept my eye on it.  I eventually turned off of 127 street heading west on 122 Ave.  I lost sight for a bit but regained sight just before reaching St. Albett Trail.  I actually stopped the vehicle and with the monocular got a very good look at the object.  It had 2 red lights on left and right sides of the d! isk with a pinkish red hue emanating from the thin center part of the disk.  The 2 lights stayed in place while the disk was wobbling like you would see a coin wobble on a table before coming to a rest, with the outward sides bobbing up and down.  The motion on the disk however was much slower.  Aside from the 2 lights and the emanating hue the disk appeared to be black with no rotors, no exhaust, nothing sticking out. I have submitted a drawing with this. I am 50 years old, married with children and work full time.  I have a University degree and two college diplomas.;53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259

It was a clear sky with excellent visibility.  The object seemed to appear out of nowhere.  It was about 400 meters high and I estimate about 1 kilometer south of me. I got a very good look at it with a monocular that I carry with me.  It was disc shaped, about 6-8 feet in diameter and about 1-2 feet in width.   Object was all black, no lights or exhaust, no markings.  The unusual thing was that it wobbled as it travelled south at about 50 km\hr.  Its wobble was similar to that of a coin that has been spun and is about to come to a rest.   There was a helicopter that was heading east across the trajectory of the unknown object and it seems to me the pilot should have seen the object because it was so close to the helicopter. But it seemed as though he could not see it.   I phoned traffic control at the International Airport to see if they got it on radar.  NavCanada got back to me and said they spoke to the pilot and he said he saw nothing. NavCanada played back the radar recording and there was nothing on their radar except for the helicopter. I am 50, married with children, work full time.  I have a University degree and two College diplomas.;53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259
White/grey Disk UFO seen Floating above Edmonton;2019-05-20 20:00:00;10 minutes;White/grey Disk UFO seen Floating above Edmonton Hi, I am reporting my sighting of a half visible UFO object which seemed to look white on the bottom, and very light shade of grey towards the top.	 I had noticed it while biking. There is no lie when it comes to me explaining to people about my sightings. 	 A fact for you to know is that I spotted it twice, the most recent one was 20 minutes ago, 8:15PM.  It disappeared so I can not prove it no matter how much I want to.  What i can do is add an image that looks identical to my sightings. It will not look exactly the same.  It was higher into the sky, and not as dark coloured.  More out in the distant I would say.;53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259
