I was waiting for the bus going home from work one day, when i saw an UFO.  It was hovering in the sky, it looked like a black diamond shaped aircraft (Vertically) with flashing green and red lights on the side.  It looked to be very high.  The background a clear sky with only few clouds.  It hovered for about 8 seconds in the sky and then suddenly it flew off into the distance with very high speed (Looked to be around 800mph)  I head a slight sound that sounded like a gust of wind but other then that it was silent.  I only saw one. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD));53.5276035555556;-113.499993259259
