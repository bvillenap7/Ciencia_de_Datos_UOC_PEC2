I noticed a large globe hovering in the sky, it had lights all over it I thought that was not a star it was too large and too close, there was one very clear bright one and 3 others smaller, except for another that was a little larger than the rest.  I was very tired my husband was sleeping so I just went back to bed. I am a senior citizen,  I am healthy no issues, wear glasses, for driving, reading but I still have good vision without them.;49.5896;-114.1624
