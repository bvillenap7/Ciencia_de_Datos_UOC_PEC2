((Starlink satellites??));2020-01-24 19:15:00;20 minutes;I witnessed a straight line of what looked like stars moving across the sky, perfectly spaced out.  At any given time there were 14-15 visible lights that at the exact same spot would disappear I to the night sky.  There were approximately 40-50 from the time I noticed them until the last one vanished. I don't believe there would be that many aircraft leaving the Grande Prairie airport at the same time, or satellites moving in such a perfect line;55.2228;-118.0105
