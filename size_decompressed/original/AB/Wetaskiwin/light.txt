Bright red light almost spherical flew across the dark night from West to East, North of our Apartment.  Did not see any strobe light that is common to aircraft.  There was no sound, an roommate said it almost looked like a diamond shape a top of red light.  I couldn't see any real shape other then a bright red light smoothly traveling West to East.  It seemed to move a lot faster then any commercial aircraft would move.  It was not a comet it did not burn out or go in a downward spiral.  I tried to take a picture, but my camera wouldn't pick it up in the dark.;52.968;-113.3607

Weird slow flashing red lights that hovered for a bit then started following our vehicle. Made no sound whatsoever. There was a weird spotlight thing as well coming from the front of the craft.;52.968;-113.3607
