HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Golden cylinder was pacing our vehicle.;1996-09-15 16:00:00;approx: 30 minutes;Golden cylinder was pacing our vehicle. This sighting report received July 26, 2003:  The sighting took place in Alberta in the fall of 1996, early September , the sky was clear to the north and west around 4:30 p.m. we were travelling westbound  from Vergreville to Edmonton My girlfriend a local vet, was in the truck with me. We were about 20 minutes out of Vegreville when I looked out of the passenger side window of the truck a long narrow golden cylinder was pacing our vehicle at about around 700 feet.. I watched amazed and then woke my girlfriend we both could not figure out exactly what it was that we were seeing. I am an ex military member , skydiver and aviation enthusiast. We watched for nearly half an hour as we drove along. It was not an atmospheric anomaly or trick of lighting. This object paced us at 110 km an hour and appeared to react to our minor changes in speed it was about 1/4 mile away from the Yellow Head Highway in the northern sky. Here is where it gets funny I don't remember the object leaving and when I questioned My girlfriend about it a year later, she reacted emotionally (unusual for her) she had absolutely no memory of the object.. we both can remember what we did prior to travelling , but she has no memory at all of this event. (I am black she's white shades of betty & barney) We are no longer together but we have a daughter now.
