Sky lit up red when it disapeared.;2003-04-06 23:00:00;About 5 minutes;Sky lit up red when it disapeared. I was babysitting my neighbor's kids and it was about 11:00pm when I saw the UFO.  I saw it in Langdon, Alberta.  (Langdon is a really small town that's about 15 minutes out of Calgary) I looked out the window and all of a sudden I saw this saucer shaped object in the sky.  It had red lights all around the outside of it like a border.  I watched it just hover in the sky for about 3 minutes.  Then the whole sky lit up red and the object disapeared.  I continued to look out the window to see if it would come back but it didn't.  I know that what I saw was not an airplane, helicopter, etc.;50.9744;-113.6763
