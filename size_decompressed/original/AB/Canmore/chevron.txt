Black, chevron-shape craft silently flew North east over Canmore Ab.;2017-05-10 19:00:00;2 minutes;Black chevron shape craft silently flew North east over Canmore Ab. I was hiking down on a trail above the powerline trail near grassi lakes in Canmore.  I looked up above the trees toward the Three Sisters Mountains, so in between Three Sisters and Mt. Haling, and saw a triangular chevron shaped craft flying/gliding perfectly straight towards the east end of Grotto Mountain above Canmore, between 10,000 and 20,000 feet in the air.  It was moving at least 3 times faster than any commercial jets I saw, but there was no sound.   It disappeared behind the trees again and then I ran to an opening at the end of the trail, which took maybe 20 seconds, and it was no longer visible.   It was solid black no visible  lights or markings.  I tried to take 2 pictures with my phone but it didn't show up it was either behind the trees or the background was to bright and it couldn't pick it up.  Either way there is nothing visible in the pictures.;51.0868;-115.3504
