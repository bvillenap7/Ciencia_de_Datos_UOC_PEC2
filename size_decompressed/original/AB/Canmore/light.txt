Star emitted white light beam and rapidly changed direction.;2018-04-15 03:00:00;3 seconds;Star emitted white light beam and rapidly changed direction. Paddling on the Rundle Forebay Reservoir at around 3am and saw what looked like a star directly to the east above Mt. Fable.  The star got brighter and then produced what looked like headlight beams (white) before rapidly changing direction (roughly 45 degrees) to the north and out of the atmosphere as a single red dot.  3 other witnesses saw the event.  Thought it might have been a meteor ricocheting off the Troposphere.  Incredible event to have witnessed regardless of object.;51.0868;-115.3504
