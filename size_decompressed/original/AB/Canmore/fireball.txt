As I was rounding the bend by Lac Des Arcs a bright green fireball dropped from the sky and disappeared behind the shadow of a mountain.  Wow, I have never seen a UFO before and really want to know if any one else saw this. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
