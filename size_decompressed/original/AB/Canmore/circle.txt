The light looked to be about 5mm across from my current altitude of 4620ft.  There was no sound and it was moving slowly from West to East originating from The Spray Lakes area.  At one point, after it had passed over head, it appeared to hover or change direction to the SE as it stood still in the sky for a good 15-20 seconds then continued off to the East. Frantic  I quickly hung-up on my wife - I took some quick pictures with my iPhone as the object was over head and even attempted to get some video as it hovered to the SE. The object was too high to be a helicopter and had no red or green wing or rotor lights.  I feel the inclusion of the hover or change in direction rules out the ISS or a satellite, also I have seen the ISS and satellites many times and this was too low of an altitude and the size too great to be either of them. I have posted an original unedited picture I captured to my Google Drive and it can be viewed here:  https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B1nvmKVaxG72TVVsdnRZeWdQMEE/edit?usp=sharing   On a copy of the image I was able to enhance the shadow and highlights to reveal what looks to be a round disk shape (seen as a black ring blocking out the sky behind it) and a thin secondary, yet broken, halo of light that I can only assume is from light being emitted from the top of the object.  It is the most compelling UFO photo I have seen to date and if I hadnâ€™t seen it with my own two eyes, I would still find the images very hard to explain with any known craft in the skies today. The shadow and highlight enhanced photo can be viewed here:  https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B1nvmKVaxG72UzRSai1NRkNpZEk/edit?usp=sharing   Again I retain full copyright on the two images I have provided and as such they cannot be copied or reproduced in any way without my knowledge and signed written consent.;51.0868;-115.3504
