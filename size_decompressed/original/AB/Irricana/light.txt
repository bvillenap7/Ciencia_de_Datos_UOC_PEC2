High-altitude light unlikely to have been satellite or aircraft.;2014-07-29 01:30:00;2-4 seconds;High-altitude light unlikely to have been satellite or aircraft 01:30 AM, July 29, 2014   Light, white, observed for 2 to 4 seconds (estimated) travelling slowly from SSE to NNW.  Observed around 60â€“70 degrees from horizontal (estimated), disappeared before reaching overhead point.  Brilliance equivalent to aircraft landing lights.   Only traversed a few degrees of arc before vanishing.  Mode of disappearance was odd: imagine a flash-light pointed toward the observer, being tilted up until the light was no longer visible. Cloud cover:  Nearly cloudless night, possibly a few high wisps. Moon:  None sighting was two days after new moon. Sound:  none. Navigation/running lights/strobe:  None observed. Meteor: sighting had none of the characteristics of a meteor: slow movement, no trail. Delayed reporting this until I was reasonably satisfied that it was not a satellite or an aircraft.  Believe it was too late at night for a satellite.   Subsequent observation of aircraft in the area has shown that navigation lights/strobe lights are quite visible to the naked eye, even on high flying craft.  I looked for these lights at the time of the sighting, was not able to observe any.   Unfortunately, I did not have field glasses with me at the time.  I had the light in sight for two to four seconds, but had just turned to view that section of the sky, so have no idea how long it could have been visible before that.;51.3186;-113.6198
