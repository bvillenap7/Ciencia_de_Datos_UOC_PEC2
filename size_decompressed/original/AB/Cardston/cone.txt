Bright blue ball of light;2005-10-07 10:30:00;5 Seconds;Bright blue ball of light I was watching television, out of the corner of my eye, to the North West I suddenly saw a very large round, blue light, it wasn't there before, and it looked like it was falling out of the sky as if it was going to hit the ground, and then it was gone just like that.  Very bright, very blue.  I have never in my life ever seen anything like that ever.   I am frightened, because I live out of town.. should I be frightened?  I am not one to lie, or to fabricate anything, and it was so strange..so fast. Like it just disappeared within seconds.;49.1984;-113.3133
