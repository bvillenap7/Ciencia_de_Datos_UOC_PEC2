Crystal clear evening watching the stars when right above me a translucent triangle type something with about 6?  Lights, emitting zero sound and moved so fast i only saw it for about 2 seconds.  Flowing colors, faint but noticeable.  May have been about 500 meters wide.  Wow. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));54.1541;-115.6861
