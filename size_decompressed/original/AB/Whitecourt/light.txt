It was a clear night and from the East I saw 4 lights streaking across the sky moving in close proximity to one another. The lights had an orange tinge to them. The altitude appeared to be well below that of satellite orbits. The lights disappeared in the sky to the West of me. They were travelling at a high rate of speed and were only visible to me for about 5 seconds. No sound. Stealth aircraft training in our area?;54.1541;-115.6861
Bright white, red and green light over whitecourt, ab;2014-11-03 08:45:00;10 minutes;Bright white, red and green light over whitecourt, ab As we entered Whitecourt from the North, we noticed two lights in the sky.  One was very obviously a helicopter as it moved slowly through the sky.  The other we thought was a helicopter as it had a bright white light and smaller flashing red light.  The bright white light changed to bright green and the object moved quickly through the sky circling in front of us.  The smaller flashing red light at times swung out quite far from the main light and at times disappeared completely.  As we entered the city, we lost sight of it, but then it reappeared and again circled around at various speeds.;54.1541;-115.6861
