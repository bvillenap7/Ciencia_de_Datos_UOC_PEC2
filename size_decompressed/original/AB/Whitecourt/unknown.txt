On the night of Wed April 27, 2005 at approximately 11:00 PM I was star gazing in my backyard. I was facing North and saw what appeared to me as two reddish, dimly glowing lights travelling at high rate of speed in a northerly direction.  My initial thoughts were that this could have been an aircraft such as an F18 and I was seeing the jets as it flew away from me. I continued to watch the sky for a few moments and then saw another reddish glow this time moving in an easterly direction. This time I am certain I saw the body of an aircraft even though it was dark. There was no sound!  When jetliners pass overhead at 30,000 ft I hear them. I see satellites every night I star gaze and they simply appear as moving stars. Was it a low flying satellite?  I reported this sighting a couple of weeks ago. This time I have provided you with location and contact info.;54.1541;-115.6861
