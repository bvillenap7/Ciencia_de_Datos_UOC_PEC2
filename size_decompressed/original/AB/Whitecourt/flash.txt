Looking up to the east I noticed a satilite moveing across the sky form the north to south. As I watched it, it tracked a steady course and speed. The light reflecting from it was constant and even. It's size was about the same as that of a ball point pen, to the naked eye.  Then for about the duration of a second and a half ,the light increased in a perfect solid circle about 100 - 150% in size and brigthness.Then began to dim, and it's tragetory changed about 20- 30 degrees to the east I guess.  As I continued watching the light continued to dim till it was not visible anymore.The speed remained constant throughout this event except for the second and a half when the size and brightness changed. ((NUFORC Note:  Probably not the flare from an Iridium satellite.  The nearest was at 23:09 hrs. (local) on this date.  PD));54.1541;-115.6861
