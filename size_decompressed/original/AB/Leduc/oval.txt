They were illuminating grey objects. It was dark out since it was 6:01 am, and was seen in the horizon south of leduc. I'm not sure how far away it was since it was in the horizon, but I don't believe it to be a parachute as it moved quick into the horizon until it could not be scene ( almost like how the sun sets into the horizon).;53.2659;-113.5587
