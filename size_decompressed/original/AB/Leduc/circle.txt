I took my children to see the Canada day fireworks display and a few minutes in we noticed a green ball/orb floating off in the distance, behind and around the fireworks.  A number of other people soon started talking around us about the same thing.  The initial occurrence of seeing the object lasted several minutes.  I quickly dismissed the possibility of it being an aircraft as the flight pattern was not something I know or had a seen a plane being capable of doing.  It appeared to be traveling quite slowly, but then it would alter its path very quickly and even zipped up from a straight line into a  90 degree turn upwards.  After several minutes, we lost sight of it.  The object appeared a short time later on the west side of the fireworks display.  It maintained a straight path towards the display going eastward and then it actually stopped in midair for a minute or so and then continued going east where we lost track of it again.  As I said, several people arou! nd us and my children all saw the orb.,;53.2659;-113.5587
