She sent a video through her phone, saying it didn't do it justice, that the lights were very large. She went outside the front of the house on Westview Drive to film them.  She described them as coming from the Southwest going to the Northeast. They were orange in colour and oval to round.  When I asked her how they were moving (as compared to how they were filmed on her phone (which wasn't completely steady) and I asked her, Were they buzzing round like bees?  Or going more smoothly?   She said they were moving rather smoothly. She said the whole event took place for about 3 minutes.  If you would like video, please contact her.;51.9167;-114.0333
