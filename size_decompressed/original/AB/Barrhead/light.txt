Slow green light over treeline;2009-10-07 01:00:00;15 seconds;Slow green light over treeline While lieing on the couch in my living room I noticed a bright green looking light above the tree line 1/2 mile out. I had the lights of the home off because I was trying to sleep so I could see it very clear out my living room window. It moved along slowly in a strait line for about 3/4 of a mile, this took about 12 seconds, stoped for about 3 seconds and then vanished. It was a clear night with no northren lights. The light looked about the size of a truck and was very bright. There was no sound that would identify an air craft that I could hear.

Bright white light by tower;2010-10-25 07:12:00;1.5 minutes;Bright white light by tower While driving from country to town, to work I noticed a bright white light floating just off from a tower just West of town. The light was motionless or seemed that way while I watched as I drove. It looked to be floating about a mile from the tower off to the south.  I was 6 miles from the tower traveling strait towards it.  The light was there and then seemed to fade away slowly getting dim then gone. The light was brighter then the sun rise in the east and was not located near the actual rising sun but quite a bit further south.  There was some light cloud cover and the light was under the clouds.  A very bright white light is the best way to describe it like the sun refecting off of it.  This object would have been 200 ft from the ground.I watched to see if I could spot aircraft lights as I drove past but could see none.
