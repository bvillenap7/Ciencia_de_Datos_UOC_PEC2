My wife and I saw three lights in the sky in a nort east direction from the highway. The lights were quite far off so we didn't think they were unusual at first, maybe planes. At first two appeared to be flying towards each other, then they avoided each other. One went high and one went low. The first light continued west while the other one stopped and just hung there. A third one appeared above the light that was moving, sort of flickered a little and then went dark. The two remaining lights stayed still after that for about 10 minutes. We drove through Nanton and were still able to see the lights though they seemed much closer now. I pulled over to the shoulder of the road and got my video camera out and and was standing on the side of the road waiting to see if the lights would move again. The third light reappeared and it was much, much closer now. I was able to film a about 15-20 seconds of it. It appears brightly , fades, then reappears then seems to turn to the east and there appears to be lights surrounding it flickering on and off.;50.3516;-113.7617
