On the evening of Jul 10, 2019, at 9:38 pm, I was in my yard, watering plants.  The news forecast was predicting possible thunder storms,  so I looked up to check the sky.  That’s when I noticed the brilliant pink colors which I had never seen before.   The sun was just starting to go down. I grabbed my Samsung phone and took a total of 14 pictures of the sky with the brilliant bright pink colors.  I viewed the pictures approximately 10 minutes later as I wanted to upload the best one to Facebook.  I noticed a “mark” on one of the pictures.  When I zoomed in on the picture I knew this was not a scratch on my lens or an insect as there was a pink cloud in front of the object. At 9:55 pm I decided to send the picture through messenger to a local journalist here in Medicine Hat, Alberta. At 10:09 pm the pink sky was fading fast and the street lights were just beginning to turn on.   I thought I would take a few more pictures in the direction of where I took the first pictures.    The 4 pictures I took were a darker blue hue that still had some light pink clouds in the area where the unidentifiable object had been. When I think back,  I did not “hear” any loud noises that would have caught my attention like an airplane.  I did not physically see the object until I viewed my pictures.  It had to be going very fast though as the picture before (213806) was about 7 seconds apart from (213814).  Up to this point I had assumed the vessel was travelling SW because the dome is on the right hand side.  However, if the dome is the front of the aircraft then it could have been travelling NE in which case there may be a slight object in the picture 213806 which was taken before picture 213814. The following day, Jul 11, 2019, at 12:34 pm, my pictures were uploaded to the Facebook page “Community TV” by the journalist.  (The original picture & the zoomed in picture).  There was a woman who confirmed seeing the object, which had no color and no wings (like an airplane). Today, Saturday Jul 13, 2019, I came across a website that had a similar picture of a siting which was dated Feb 22, 2019, on the following website:  https://mufoncms.com/pubic_report/ website.;49.9702607692308;-110.571008461539
