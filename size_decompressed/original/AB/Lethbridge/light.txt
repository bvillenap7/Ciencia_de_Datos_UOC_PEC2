Light in the sky passing over head, then fading away.;2013-12-16 18:45:00;30-60 seconds;Light in the sky passing over head, then fading away. I was standing outside on my deck having a cigarette, looking up at the stars as i often do. I noticed a light moving that appeared to be a satellite as it was in a constant path and was not at an altitude that a commercial jet or a lower flying cessna would be at.  As i continued to watch, it became brighter, then it faded away almost as if you were watching from a distance someone turning off a light.  It also could not have been a shooting star as it did not streak across the sky, and lasted far longer.;49.6659275862069;-112.804475
Red object with severe elevation changes and erratic movements during fireworks show in Lethbridge, Alberta.;2016-07-01 23:05:00;15 minutes;Red object with severe elevation changes and erratic movements during fireworks show in Lethbridge, Alberta. July 1st fireworks started and a red light caught my 5 year old's eye.  I told him it was a red star.  I kept watching the fireworks but I would glance back at the so called star wondering why it was so red.   After nearly 5 minutes the red light began to move erratically.  There was a large crowd for the fireworks show and I asked the closest people to us if they could see the object.  They could not be live they're eyes.  The astonishment of this moving object spread to others and instead of watching the show, most were focused on the object.   I would say it had intense elevation changes, did not flash, could stop in air for long lengths of time and was very fast.   Lasted approximately 15 minutes.;49.6659275862069;-112.804475

Very fast, and faint 3 lights traveling in a northbound heading;2020-07-28 23:55:00;7 seconds;Very fast, and faint 3 lights traveling in a northbound heading Sitting outside in my friends backyard, clear evening, looking at satellites going by and suddenly there were 3 Faint lights traveling in a northbound heading, diagonal in orientation and far too fast to be a satellite and too low to be an aircraft without making sound or any other visible markings.  There were no other identifying marks or lights.  They where very faint indicating high altitude but traveling very very fast, seemingly to indicate low altitude.  Confirmed sighting with friend who saw them as well;49.6659275862069;-112.804475
