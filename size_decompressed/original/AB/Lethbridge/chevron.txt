I reported this to MUFON these lights passed directly over us as we sat on our deck it was really large and probably covered our whole house  i was looking straight up and it came into my view and was going really fast, when i screamed out my daughter looked up and also saw it bright white perfectly round circles of light (about the size of a basketball) in a v formation (i think it was 7 lights but i may have even been 9) my daughter was at a different angle than me and saw it a split second later ( she saw whisps of light off of it) it was going really fast and was gone in a couple of seconds it made no sound it was travelling north to south ( we live on a park and earlier that night there were a bunch of kids playing with really bright flashlights on the park, directing them everywhere and on the large trees and slide);49.6659275862069;-112.804475
