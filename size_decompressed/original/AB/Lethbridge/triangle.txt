HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Two triangle shaped flying objects.;2003-07-22 00:20:00;5 seconds;Two triangle shaped flying objects . I was just returning from a midnight jog and I was sitting on my front steps which face south and was just cooling off then I noticed something moving in the sky not exactly above me but to the west a bit.  I thought they were birds flying overhead but when I stood up to take a better look they were two triangle shaped flying objects with what looked like orange tips on each corner.  I couldn't really see the object perfectly clear because of the city lights.  As they disappeared behind a tree on the west side of my house I ran west to the street to follow them as they flew without a sound in a northwest direction but couldn't see nothing after that.  As I stood there gazing up at the sky I noticed a bright star which probably was the Space station moving in an eastern direction.  I don't know what to make of this event but am thankful that I am one of the few to witness something like this.  Thank you to the witness for the report. I also am seeking permission to pass this report to AUFOSG  Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.

Footsteps heard on the roof and triangular object with lights in the night sky.;2013-08-10 22:00:00;1 hour;Footsteps heard on the roof and triangular object with lights in the night sky. I have lived in Lethbridge, Alberta, for most of my life.  I do belief there is life out there, after what I'm going to tell you. It all started on August the 6th, 2013, at 5:45am.  I have just woken up from sleep and to my surprise I could hear foot steps on my roof.  To my opinion I imagine that the neighbor's next door were fooling around and jumping from roof to roof.  So I went outside and looked to see if there was anyone on the roof, and there was no one on the roof to my surprise.  I questioned the footsteps that I herd that I clearly could distinguish between that of a bird or human they were clearly foot steps of some thing on the roof. On August the 7th 2013 about 6:39am I was awaken to footsteps once again coming from overhead on the roof.  I proceeded to the front door to investigate.  I looked outside and walked to the outside of the house and could not see anyone on the roof.  Once again I questioned the footsteps on the roof.  This time there were two of them going in a circular shuffle. A couple of these episodes continued for three day's and on the final day the 10th of August 2013 around 22:00hrs as I was sitting on my front steps I noticed in the sky as I was sitting down of to the East a perfect triangle shaped object in the sky.  It's approximate distance was about 2000ft to 3000ft maybe more or less.  It hand lights perfectly spaced apart at each point of the triangle and it glowed as it highlighted its summitry.  It was not like the stars were they were scattered all over the place this object had perfect shape like a triangle with three points that were light up.  I was thinking of getting my Iphone but I was too much in awe wish I did. Now I question what could this whole encounter have been, and I have no clear answer that's why I'm writing you this report. Can you help me understand what is going on, is this real. I think in my mind it is real because it happened I was there, awake, alert, conscious. It always happened in the early in the morning around 5am or 6am. I think these things are ufo,s and extraterrestrials. Well to tell you the truth I kid you not, this was real it happened. Thank you for your time in reading my encounter. p.s ever since the lights and footsteps my back has lower back has been killing me.;49.6659275862069;-112.804475
