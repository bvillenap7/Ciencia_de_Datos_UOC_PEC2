The light was travelling at about 200 kilometers per hour and about 25 - 30 feet above the ground.  The size of the light was round and approximately 30 feet in diameter and bright blue white pulsing light. After comparing what I saw with two other people I realized what I saw was something other than any ordinary vehicle.;49.6659275862069;-112.804475
