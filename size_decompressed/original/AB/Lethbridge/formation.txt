6 dark triangle shapes in formation;2020-07-21 12:30:00;30 seconds;6 dark triangle shapes in formation Went outside and saw 6 huge triangle shapes blocking the sky above it. The were in a diagonal formation heading North. They were low flying, looked large enough to be 6 planes. They made no noise, and had no lights. They lightly reflected the lights from the city, but were dark enough to block out the night sky. They couldn’t be birds as they didn’t move other than gliding across the sky.  When looking at the sky, if you put your hand up, they were the length of the tip of my thumb to the tip of my middle finger. Pretty large. They moved North in the formation, then sped up and got smaller. I think this means they were going upwards into the sky.  It only lasted about 30 seconds, and they were gone by the time my sister made her way outside from 10 feet away. Our cats also ran to the balcony door and went crazy.;49.6659275862069;-112.804475
