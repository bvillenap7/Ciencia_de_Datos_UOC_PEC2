anomalous object with erractic flight patterns over Lethbridge, Alberta.;2010-12-23 18:00:00;five minutes;anomalous object with erractic flight patterns over Lethbridge, Alberta. Around 18:00 on Thursday, December 23 2010, my friend and I were driving down 13th Street North In Lethbridge, Alberta.  I happened to look to the sky and noticed one blue light in the south/southwest area of the sky. I immediately told my friend to look. We watched it as we quickly found somewhere to park and observe this object.  The object was blue when we had first seen it, but by the time we had parked it was red.  The object then changed colours again, this time it was white. Neither of us could make out the shape of the object.  It flew very quickly, from one end of the sky to the other, neither of us had seen anything fly that quickly before. It changed directions erratically. One minute it would be flying east, and the next it would be flying west. A few times it would seem to change altitudes as well. The whole time we observed the object it continued changing colours, blue, red, and white. The white seemed exceptionally bright. They were not flashing! lights, and they would remain one colour a few seconds before changing again. The anomalous  flight pattern continued for approximately three minutes, at which time it just seemed to simply disappear.;49.6659275862069;-112.804475
Green soundless object seen in Lethbridge night sky;2020-08-21 21:55:00;1 minute;Green soundless object seen in Lethbridge night sky A strange object emitting green light flew past the sky from SE to W.  Because it was dark I couldn't see the shape of the object.  The speed was not too fast, almost comparable to a light aircraft.  It did not generate any sound when it flew past the sky.  For the altitude, it wasn't flying too high. I could see it roughly for a minute before I lost sight of it.;49.6659275862069;-112.804475
