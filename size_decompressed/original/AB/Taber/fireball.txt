Bright white ball of light observed moving in southern Alberta skies.;2012-06-06 23:35:00;2 minutes;Bright white ball of light observed moving in southern Alberta skies. Myself & my wife had just returned home from the store.  I stepped out of the van,& as I was closing the the door I looked straight up into the sky.  Directly over me I saw what I thought was a very very bright star.  I commented to my wife, hey look at how low & bright this star is honey!!  As she walked over to my side of the van & eyed the object I was pointing at, it started to move straight up into the sky.  Then once it looked allot closer to the stars in the sky, (there were allot of stars out that night,the sky was very clear, & their was a very very light breeze coming out of the west) it took off at a great speed in a Easterly direction.  Then it slowed down, started to zig-zag from right to left while continuing in a Easterly direction until it faded out of sight.  We have also scene other very similar objects, this one was a very bright white, others were orange & blue.;49.7883;-112.1442
