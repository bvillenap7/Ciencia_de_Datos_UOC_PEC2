unusual lights in the sky.;2001-12-22 03:06:00;5 min.;unusual lights in the sky. The morning of the twenty second of dec. 2001 at 3:06 a.m. my husband , two year old grandson and I were heading by truck to from lethbridge ab.to winnipeg mb.a run we do twice a week .I was looking at a star that was particularly colorful and I had turned to my husband for brief second. At the same time we both looked out and three round lights very suddenly appeared close to where I was looking at the star to begin with, they were white round and in a circular pattern , the top light was smaller than the other two.Both of us excalimed over the sudden appearance of the lights and how they seemed to be moving away from us slowly.As we watched they traveled slowly north east( I used the star I was looking at as a refference point)for about three to five minutes.They then blinked out and were gone as quickly as they had appeared.;49.7883;-112.1442
