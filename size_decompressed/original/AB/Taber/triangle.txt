I woke up at about 1 am, and just could not sleep, which was never a problem for me.  i could hear a very distant sound outside, it sounded like an irrigation pump, kind of an eerie, dull, hum.  this sound became gradually louder over the next hour or so, as i stayed awake.  it eventually became very loud, and the house started to vibrate.  i looked out of my window, and saw a huge (about the size of a football field)gray, triangular object, with dim white, blue and red lights on it.  it seemed to almost hover over the house, as it moved very slowly toward the south. when i initially looked out my window, the entire object was not visible.  over about 10 seconds or so, as the object moved over the house, i could eventually make out the gray, triangular shape. in an instant, it had disapeared, further toward the south-west.  i ran into my parents room to wake them, i was almost hysterical.  they said that they heard nothing.  the next day, my mother told me that her friend, who lived just a few blocks from us, said that she woke up at about three in the morning, and that her house was shaking also, but she never saw anything, as she never looked outside.  this was a very real thing that i saw, and the fact that my mothers friend told her that her house shook at about 3 am, is all the reassurance that i need.  i was 21 years old at the time, and had just completed my third year of nursing at the university of Letbridge.
