Shape shifting light in sky in remote forest location;2003-08-21 02:30:00;45 minutes;Shape shifting light in sky in remote forest location Myself and three friends were camping in the forestry reserve approximately 40 kilometres North of Cochrane, Alberta. There was a total fire ban at the time due to the high risk of wildfires, so it was absolutely dark.  Around 2:30 in the morning we were sitting around our picnic table in the dark, when suddenly we noticed a strange light in the southwestern sky that hadn't been there moments before. The light was white, and at first it was about as bright as the brightest stars in the sky.  However, as we watched the light grew brighter and brighter, although it appeared relatively stationary over one point of the valley, quite high in the sky. Eventually the light was brighter than any star or planet could be. I don't think it was a helicopter, because we would have heard a helicopter in the still night, but this light made no noise.  As we continued to watch the light, it would move up and down and side to side in the air, but not very much.  It also grew brighter and dimmer at intervals.  As we watched, the intense bright light faded again, and eventually vanished completely.  The sky in that area was dark again.  Moments later the light reappeared in the same spot, and soon it was shining brightly again. The way the light waxed and waned reminded me of watching a lighthouse from a distance, where the light gets brighter, then fades away, then reappears.  We continued watching the light for about 45 minutes. In this time the light gradually moved away from us in a southwesterly direction.  We noticed that in addition to moving up and down and side to side, the light would appear to change shape, sometimes seeming to be two connected points of light, sometimes one large round point of light, sometimes a square shaped light.  The light would also seem to change colour - it was dominantly white, but sometimes seemed orange or green in colour.  The object was still in the sky when we went to bed, but it did not return the next night.;51.1802;-114.4698
Very large, bright satellite of unknown origin;2008-07-19 22:21:00;App. 2 min;Very large, bright satellite of unknown origin Date: July 19, 2008 Time: 10:21 p.m. MDST Place: Paddyâ€™s Flats Campground near Bragg Creek Alberta Duration: approximately 2 minutes  While sitting around a campfire with friends we occasionally spotted satellites passing overhead. All were faint pinpricks of light traveling in a constant direction and constant speed. Most could only be seen for the few seconds that they were almost directly overhead. We noticed a large bright star moving from southwest to northeast. This object was as big and bright as Venus. It was silent and moved in a constant direction at a constant speed. No flashing strobe lights of any kind were seen. I am sure it was a satellite, but I have never seen one so big and so bright. I checked the NASA website and it was not the ISS or the Shuttle.;51.1802;-114.4698
Dec. 14th, '14, multi-colored lights hovered in the sky east of Calgary between 22:30 and 23:30.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sirius??  PD));2014-12-14 22:30:00;40 minutes;December 14th, 2014, multi-colored lights hovered in the sky east of Calgary between 22:30 and 23:30 I went out on the deck Sunday night and first spotted a shooting star, I looked east and there was a very bright object in the sky that had colored lights, red, green and white, at first I thought it was a plane but  the object did not move.  I looked at it through binoculars and the lights were very distinct almost in a circular pattern but the object was too far away. It remained in the same position for the entire time I watched, which was about 45 minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  Sirius??  PD));51.1802;-114.4698

Fleet of UFO's pass over Cochrane, Ab.  ((Spacelink satellites??));2019-12-29 18:50:00;15 minutes;Fleet of UFO's pass over Cochrane,Ab Hello By far not the first sighting we've had living here but this one was...epic, thought I'd share. First observed two lights traveling slowly one following the other (same as satellites) in a slow-straight line overhead.  Knowing satellites never travel together in pairs I went inside my home to call my wife.  At first she noticed the two satellite looking lights, then she panicked and said There's more!! We watched over twenty objects one after another slowly crossing the sky, appearing from the distance (+10 km) out of maybe fog or cloud (very dark out), traveling in a line above us heading from the West, eventually disappearing into fog/clouds and off into the distant glow of lights in Calgary in the East. The sky was very clear other than some fog in the far distance. My wife was counting the number of objects until ran back into the house for more clothing(-8c). I gave up counting as didn't find it important and started looking around for camera and neighbors, anyone to point out and share an epic moment with, but nobody was outside.(Too dark for photograph) Terrifying thrilling better than any Netflix. Hope others who may have seen this take a minute to back us up here.wow  lol;51.1802;-114.4698
