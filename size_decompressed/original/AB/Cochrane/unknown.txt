String on various lights on sky flying on straight line and disappearing one by one on the same spot.  ((Starlink satellites??));2020-01-26 20:17:00;8 minutes;String on various lights on sky flying on straight line and disappearing one by one on the same spot We went for a dog Walsh around 8pm.  We noticed the a very strong light floating over the Rockies, then a set of various lights near it appeared to be flying on a straight line eastwards just above the Banff park area coming towards Cochrane.  They didn’t seem to stop and we’re perfectly spaced equidistantly from each other.  The as if at a marked spot, they’d disappear one by one everything their flight path raches that spot.  We saw the same lights about 2 weeks ago and we counted 6.  This time, the event lasted for about 6-8 mins and we lost count after 18 or more.;51.1802;-114.4698
