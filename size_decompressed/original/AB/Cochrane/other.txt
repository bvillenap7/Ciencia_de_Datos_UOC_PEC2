Two UFO lights, one large, one small fly over Cochrane, Alberta, Canada (07/03/2010);2010-07-03 23:15:00;5 minutes;Two UFO lights, one large, one small fly over Cochrane, Alberta, Canada (07/03/2010) Was walking a friend to his car when noticed a light coming from the west about the same height as a small aircraft would fly. Then to my amazement I noticed this large bright light had a dimmer/smaller companion light trailing behind and slightly below it. The larger light was similar to the brightness of Venus on a clear night. The smaller light more consistant to the brightness of a typical satelite.  I ran inside to get other witness's,apon returning we all watched them fly completly silent and in a perfect straight line almost directly over our home.  I took note that the stars where visible between the two lights as it flew giving the impression of being two objects, although these two lights stayed in pefect unison untill roughly 3 minutes into the sighting roughly (1 mile past our home) when the trailing-smaller light slowly moved and to the lower right of the bigger light.  It's very possible if the two were connected-the object could have been tilting to give this effect.  The object made no sound whatsoever. Nobody felt paranoia only exitement and extreme wonderment.  We watched it untill, at about a quarter at arms length from the horizon, it suddenly (not instantly) both blinked out out.If these two lights were connected it would have been absolutely massive, football stadium sized would be an understatement.
