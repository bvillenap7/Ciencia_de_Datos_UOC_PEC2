A ball of fire in the sky.;2017-02-08 06:00:00;5 minutes;A ball of fire in the sky I was leaving to go to work (it was foggy)  I drove out to main road and turned right , I seen a very bright ball to my left.  I instantly thought it was the moon.  but I stopped and backed up as the object i was seeing was in the northwest and the moon on clear mornings is always to the south when I leave the house. . It was very bright like a ball of fire sitting above the trees. I have a picture I have filled out a report only days after event but not sure if it went through.;53.2734097222223;-110.061627777778
