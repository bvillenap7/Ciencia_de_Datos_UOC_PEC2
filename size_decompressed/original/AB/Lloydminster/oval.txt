Just to the left of the big dipper and next to an orange looking planet up above my back yard I saw an oval object move in a straight line across the sky It then disapeared and anouther came from the opposite direction across the previos tragectory. In total there were three oval objects moving around in awhat seemed to be a standard search patern. Just to the right of the full moon If that helps anyone who knows the stars and planets this time of year. The objects seemed to stop moving once I got it in view of my telescope. Then The one object just bobbed back and forth. Through the telescope it had a red fire flare look. then returned to bright light. the light was to bright for me to focus the telescope. At that moment the other 2 objects continued moving in there previos patterns. The one I tryed to focus on got bigger almost like it was descending downwards to get a better look. then in a flash it became small again. It is still out side in the the sky as I Type this note. On July 1 2005 In the same area above the school across the back ally Was the first night I observed these objects. On july 1 there was only one object but it followed the same patterns as the 3 I saw tonight. Its quite a rush. Tonight I started thinking and I got the strangest feeling the object was listening. For example during the time I was trying to get it in the telescope It would not stop moving untill I thought to myself I wish You weren't so fast. Dunno If this will help anyone but I am a 29 year old male with 1 child and this is the greatest thing Ive seen since the birth of my daughter. I beleve we are not alone in the universe.I just wish I had a video camera.;53.2734097222223;-110.061627777778
