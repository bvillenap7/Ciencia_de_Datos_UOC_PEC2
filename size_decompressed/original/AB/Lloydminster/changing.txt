Black mass that looked like Starlings flying in formation at 35 to 40 thousand feet .;2019-02-07 11:30:00;2 minutes;Black mass that looked like Starlings flying in formation at 35 to 40 thousand feet . Flying from Edmonton, Canada, to Huatulco Mexico.  About four hours into the flight, I looked out the window of the Boeing 737-300 to get a visual of the topography below, but when I looked out the window I notice a dark mass about 2 to 3 miles out from our plane  at the same altitude.  (flying at between 35 and 40 thousand feet).  I notice that the mass was changing shape, it was like Starlings when they are swarming.   I tried taking a picture but it looked like a black splotch, just had my I-phone.  Now my question is, do Starling fly at that altitude?  And have you heard of anything like this?;53.2734097222223;-110.061627777778
