UFO squadron sited in Lloydminster Alberta (possible U.S. military training exercise);2005-02-15 00:00:00;5 minutes;UFO squadron sited in Lloydminster Alberta (possible U.S. military training exercise) On Febuary 15th I was walking home from a friends house after a party at there house.  There was no drinking at this party(we were playing Halo 2) It was around midnight and it was a clear night with few stars in the sky.  I looked up to take in the calm night when I saw a flashing object.  I thought that it was just another one of those things but I looked at it again and saw it moving very fast across the sky.  I wasn't scared because I thought that it was too far away.  It blended right in with the sky.  It turned at rather odd and amazing angles.  Then more of these flashing objects moved in.  They looked exactly the same and then I started thinking that this was out of this world.  They started doing manouevers that looked well planned possibly they were all from the same mothership.  Then they left as quickly as they had come towards the moon.  Now that I look back on it I think that this was part of a U.S. military spy training in Canada since we are not that far from the border. ((NUFORC Note:  We are not certain whether the sighting occurred on the morning of, or evening of, February 15.  We will attempt to clarify the time with the witness.
