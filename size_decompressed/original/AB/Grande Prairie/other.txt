Large red craft in the sky over Grande Prairie, Alberta Canada.  2  witnesses.;2011-11-30 22:30:00;5 minutes;Large red craft in the sky over Grande Prairie, Alberta Canada.  2  witnesses. My girlfriend and I were standing outside when we both witnessed a large, vertical looking, red light in the sky, to the north west of our location.  Ceiling is approx. 13,000 feet of heavily overcast cloud cover tonight.  The object was definitely behind some clouds as they moved by because we could see them blocking it now and then.  The sighting lasted about 5 to 10 minutes.  After about 2 minutes, it began to pulsate.  At first it was kind of hazy and faint, but then became very large and bright.  A minute or 2 later, it appeared to begin moving towards an easterly direction at a very slow rate of speed, still pulsating.  It was quite a ways off to the north west of our location, north of the airport. There was no bad weather, or air traffic, that would have caused this light.  Also, there are no lights on in town tonight that would cause such a light to appear, let alone move through the sky. After 5 to 10 minutes of watching, we came inside.  I checked on it a few minutes later and it had disappeared.;55.1691070422536;-118.831333802817
