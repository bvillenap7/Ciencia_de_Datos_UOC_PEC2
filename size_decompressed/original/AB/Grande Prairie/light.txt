4 lights moving across the Grande Prairie Night Sky;2005-09-30 23:30:00;7 - 8 seconds;4 lights moving across the Grande Prairie Night Sky Last night (September 30th) in Grande Prairie, Alberta I was looking North at the Big & Little Dippers from a balcony downtown at the Sandman Apartments and witnessed 4 orange coloured lights move from approximately North North East to North North West.   As they approached the west side they appeared to become one and then disappeared because of the cloud cover.  They might have been traveling Northbound at this point and that could explain why they appeared to be one.  I enjoy viewing the night sky and have done so for approximately 10 years.  I've never seen anything like this.;55.1691070422536;-118.831333802817
Around 15 bright lights moving at a fast speed through out the sky;2014-04-06 23:00:00;20 minutes;Around 15 bright lights moving at a fast speed through out the sky My boyfriend and I stepped out for a smoke. We were looking up at the sky, for it was a clear night.  While we gazed out to the stars we see a light just like a star, but much brighter. It started moving fast to the north, then just disappeared.  As we kept looking we saw about 14 more located all over the sky.  Moving a very quick speed. These were not shooting stars.  They were all headed in different locations.  After about 25 minutes of activity, there was no more movement.  Not sure what they were or how distant.   Reporting from Canada north. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));55.1691070422536;-118.831333802817
Saw a blinking light in the sky, at first I thought it was a plane but then I noticed how it was moving.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sirius?  PD));2016-01-30 01:00:00;1 hour;I saw a blinking light in the sky.  At first, I thought it was a plane, but then I noticed how it was moving...up and down, side to side and in figure eights.   Over an hour it had moved slowly across the sky and disappeared behind some trees. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the witness may have been looking at Sirius.

Bright light appears in the sky, and two lights shoot off of it in varying directions.;2016-04-14 21:50:00;15 minutes;Bright light appears in the sky, and two lights shoot off of it in varying directions. I was staring out my front window to the north, and a light appeared in the sky, brighter than any star I've seen, and it was flashing blue and green and red, rapidly changing colours. I thought it might be a planet, or a satellite maybe, but it was moving in weird patterns.  It would move to the left, and then to the right, and then up. It continued this pattern for a couple of minutes. I'd like to note that this is nothing new.  I have seen this light in the sky before, and have watched it a couple of times for hours.   It's what it did next that alarmed me.  The light got really bright, and then something shot off it to the west very quickly and out of sight.   Then a couple of seconds later, another light shot off of it straight up.   The original light then blinked out, and reappeared about two seconds later across the sky, before slowly moving to the north and out of sight. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and she sounded to us to be quite serious minded.  We suspect that the report is an accurate rendition of what she had seen.

Glowing orb lights coming out of what looked like northern lights.;2016-07-06 03:00:00;20 minutes;Glowing orb lights coming out of what looked like northern lights. Group of us camping at cutbank camp site. Bridge visible from our site. 3 am we were all watching what looked like the northern lights.  One of us Saw a shooting star emerge from northern light cloud formation.  Zig zagged at unimaginable speed. Light went out and reappeared at tree top level at our camp.  Light moved in a descending s curve past three trees then disappeared.  Reappeared behind us over the trail into camp. It made several s curve maneuvers then disappeared.  Reappeared across hi way above and behind tree line again making extremely quick movements and direction changes.   Could have been several objects working in formation and turning their lights on and off together.;55.1691070422536;-118.831333802817

A single light, very visible in the sky, travelled parallel to the horizon for no more than 4 seconds.  It went very fast, though it was a good distance away.   I've seen satellites before, but the are typically not very bright and travel at a slow speed.  This object was travelling very fast.  I checked the ISS webpage and its nowhere near here. I'm assuming this is explainable, but am still curious enough to report this sighting. Sunset today was at 16:55.;55.1691070422536;-118.831333802817
