Bright flash then travel at insane speeds, me and wife saw it, cannot explain it.;2014-09-21 23:31:00;5-10 seconds;Bright flash then travel at insane speeds, me and wife saw it, cannot explain it. We heard helicopters coming towards our house, but they sounded much louder than normal hence prompting us to step outside onto our deck(our house is located on the south east side of town).  Once outside we saw two military helicopters buzz low over the town(very loud and sound so different then commercial or stars helicopters) and that caused our eyes to look at a very bright star once the helicopters were gone our focus was on this bright star.  My wife said “that is one bright star” and we both looked at it as it made an even brighter flash and looked as though it was moving away from us in a manner that it went from the brightest star in the sky to the dimmest and then completely invisible.  It moved in a way as to make a Nike check exactly like you would see in the movies when a space ship travels away into space.  It moved faster than anything I have ever seen and I am an avid watcher of meteor showers and just staring at the stars in general so it was! not a meteorite or satellite as its change in direction and speed defy my knowledge of physics.  Just thought I would report this somewhere as to be recorded, hope this adds to the banks of data.  Have a gooder.;55.1691070422536;-118.831333802817
