On a golf outing with a friend, we looked up to see a small triangular shaped object traveling at very high speed.  We did not hear any sound.   I had just finished recounting an earlier sighting of a strange craft and my friend chuckled and said, so if I look up right now, I might see a UFO?.  Then he said man, that bird is really high!.   With that I looked up to see a triangular craft moving S.E. at a very high rate of speed.  The object was between layers of Cirrus and Altostratus clouds, or between 8,000 and 15,000 feet.  It moved in a straight line from directly overhead to beyond the horizon in approximately 30 seconds.   A commercial airliner passed by at about the same altitude (using the couds as reference) a few minutes later, which helped to verify our altitude estimates and moved like a slug relative to the speedy object.  I am certain that we are visited, but more certain that most sightings (like this one) are military craft.  What a wonderful cover for our spy agencies!

Lopsided Triangular Set of Lights travelling in unisom from east to west across the night sky.;2014-04-22 00:26:00;4 seconds;Lopsided Triangular Set of Lights travelling in unisom from east to west across the night sky. While watching a meteor shower, I noticed a 5 lights traveling perfectly in unison in a lopsided triangle from East to West.  Every meteorite that I saw was traveling in a South Eastern to Northwestern direction.  The lights were low enough to go through the clouds and still be visible.   They traveled together, equal distances apart, swiftly across the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Meteors, which are simply rocks entering the Earth's atmosphere at very high velocity, can travel at any course through our atmosphere.  They aren't always seen flying along the course the witness describes.  PD));55.1691070422536;-118.831333802817
