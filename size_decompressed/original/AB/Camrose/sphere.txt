Last night I saw a strange hazy tricolour light moving slowly southward moving slightly up towards the atmosphere. I watched it for about 40 seconds. It was bright enough for about 30 seconds then it started to fade and go dim. For about 5 to 10 seconds it was lights off nothing to see, then something lit up bright blue and fell straight down. It was weird was it a sattelite, airplane, secret government aircraft, alien space ship, and then a meteor? I do't know just letting you know. Plus I have seen about five other weird sightings in the last month. These include lights moving up down and all around and lights going from a stand still to really really fast, lights moving in weird ways and then going out, and weird sounds like hummingor vibrating. I know somethings up there and I am sure you do too. Well keep watching the skys and have fun.;53.0192;-112.8347
