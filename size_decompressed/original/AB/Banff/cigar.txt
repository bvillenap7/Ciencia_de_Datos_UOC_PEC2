Peculiar picture.;2011-10-20 14:00:00;no time;peculiar picture my wife and i where on our first road trip together. It was thanksgiving weenkend of 2011, we had spent many hours driving with many pictures taken (to many in my opinion.) but my wife wanted to cherish the memories, this particular sighting wasn't seen until we had returned home. when my wife was going through the 100's of pictures taken. this picture was one of a few on top of the banff chair lift, in the background there is an object approximately the size of a fully grown spruce tree, which looks to be flying behind or from behind the mountain. the image seen is blurry but all other images are clear a day, even the smallest tree seen on the next mountain west of banff was clear, this image wasn't seen by me neither by my wife, i imagine it moved at such a velocity that even the people around us had no clue. this image has astonished my wife and i as well as every person i show. Also worth mentioning is this a national park which has a no fly zone, if it was a helicopter it would be for search and rescue, or for blasting for avalanches.  (Again this was thanksgiving and avalanche season was not even close) i don't recall seeing any such aircraft's.i don't quite know how to explain what i seen besides posting the picture which i will do.;51.1751;-115.5752
