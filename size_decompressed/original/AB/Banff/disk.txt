Flying disk shape saucer seen over tunnel mountain in Banff.;2016-11-16 18:00:00;10 minutes;Flying disk shape saucer seen over tunnel mountain in Banff. We were looking at the weird bright light sitting just over the peak of Tunnel Mountain for 10 minutes. It hovered there and pulsated bright white light.  We took pictures of it and zoomed in to see a silver saucer over the mountains and dissapeared as we were looking at our photos. It was creepy.;51.1751;-115.5752
