((NUFORC Note:  Mars sighting?))  Curious bright pulsing light.;2003-08-06 01:00:00;over an hour;((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the sighting may have been caused by Mars, which currently is in the eastern sky, and it is quite prominent.  PD)) Curious bright pulsing light. I have been sitting on my balcony while I have been on vacation this past week, waiting for my husband to come home from work in the early morning hours. What I am seeing is what I thought was the space station but after reading more about the station I can only conclude it is not. The space station would move quickly across the sky but what I am viewing is stationary. It fades to black and increases in bright red and white lights to an almost blinding radience. i have watched it for almost an hour for the past 3 nights at the same time. It appears in the SE direction. It seems to me as a cross like shape with red lights on two sides and white pulsing lights on the other two sides. It doesn't move just sits there, fading in and out. The fading makes it appear to be rotating. I really am confused as to what I am seeing and would really like someone to tell me it is an explainable thing. My husband has seen it with me last night but didn't observe it as long as I did. It  stays there for the same time each night but I always come in after an hour and just is still there when I go back out side. There have been clear night skies with no clouds as all the other stars are visible all around. Our town is pretty small and we do not have alot of illuminating lights so it is very clear. I am stumped with this.;51.1751;-115.5752
