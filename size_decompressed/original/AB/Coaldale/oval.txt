We turned down a road that reconnected with the river, leading into town. We were on a rise, overlooking the trees lining the river. We both noticed a strong light glowing from below the tree line. (near the river) Moving quickly down to the river, we saw a cigar shaped craft hovering just above the river, about 5-6 feet, without disturbing the water's surface in any way we could see, despite a strong shaking in the trees. The both of us froze-then blacked out. The next thing we remembered, we were walking back into town along the same road. The entire events of the past few moments-gone from our heads, not to be remembered until some 3 years later.;49.7189;-112.6298
