A spherical light appeared in the sky, and has not moved.;2007-03-11 20:30:00;1hour-?;A spherical light appeared in the sky, and has not moved. Me, my dad, my dad's girlfriend and her son, were all sitting in the living room watching tv, when all of a sudden a spherical shaped light, brighter than a star or satellite came into the sky.  We sat and watched it for about a half an hour and it did not move.  So my dad took out the video camera and started to record it for another half an hour, still no movement, although it seemed as though it was moving forward and backwards.   We're not sure what it was, and it is still sitting there in the sky, and the light is flickering, and it has been more than an hour now.;52.2593730263158;-113.79446381579
