Round circular UFO with bright orange lights close to the ground at night.;2010-08-25 23:00:00;2 minutes;Round circular UFO with bright orange lights close to the ground at night. It moved quickly across the sky. Looked round and either on fire or had bright orange lights. Very low to the ground. Made no sound. When it moved across the sky it got lower to the ground gradually. Then went up higher as it faded in the distance. It looked like a round fire ball orange thing but left no trail of smoke.  It pretty much appeared out of no where almost as if the lights where shut off and then turned on when it started moving. It was maybe 300-500 feet in the air.;52.2593730263158;-113.79446381579
