HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Object traveled back on itself.;1990-07-18 07:00:00;approx 20 seconds;Object traveled back on itself. My first sighting was when I was living in Red Deer, Alberta and I was working in 2 group homes with persons with physical and mental disabilities. I didn't have a car at that time so I rode my mountain bike back and forth to work. One night I was riding up to one of the homes after a fairly tough uphill ride to do a sleep - over shift from 11:00 p.m. until 7:00 a.m. the next morning. As I approached the house I rested back on my seat an noticed on my right a bright white star-like object traveling from the bottom left star of the big dipper to the right bottom star of the pot on the big dipper. As quick as it arrived to the star on the right it traveled back to the star on the left at the end of the handle. It did this one more time then disappeared.

I could view the night sky from northeast to southeast.  I was facing north, northeast and talking with my grilfriend at the time.  It was a warm, clear evening.  I am an amateur atronomer and I am quite familliar with the nightime sky.  It is probably due to my knowledge that I noticed a star that was not only in the wrong spot , but the brightest, celestial object I had ever witnessed.  It was a bright, shiny, white light.  As soon as I focused my attention on it, the light seemed to have dissapeared.  I however was able to adjust my vision quickly enough to notice two smaller points of light where the original bright spot was.  The two smaller points seemed to be at quite a high altitude, as a rough comparason for altitude, I would figure slightly lower than most orbital ranges for satellites.  They were positioned in a 45 deg. angle (see bottom for position diagram).  The points reconverged and diverged one last time.  One point went northwest and the other went south.  The point that went northwest, I lost track of when it flew in front of Orion's belt.  The point travelling south I watched for about 4 minutes until it veered southeast and it faded out of sight.  The speed seemed obviously faster compared to orbiting satellite speeds. No sound of any type was detected by anyone.  Position diagram:        . (point #1)   .

Redish flickering bright star in the sky, where no stars that size and color are.;2009-09-03 18:15:00;2 minutes;Redish flickering bright star in the sky, where no stars that size and color are. I was looking at the sky on my balcony south west, at 6:15 Mountian time, and noticed a redish color star at approx, 20 degrees in the horizon.  I often star gaze and know that there are no stars this brightness, in that area. I thought it was an aircraft, how ever it was stationary but it appeared to be moving in a very small circle. At this time I ruled out an airplane, as there are no airports in the area, and it appeared stationary. The distance was far and i could not see if it was a helicopter, I grabbed by binoculars and still could not tell. After removing my binoculars from my eyes the object disappeared, and i did not see it again. The object size in relation to my view was slightly larger than the average bright star. The sky was dark, no clouds or wind, and there were no obstructions or anything blocking my view. The total time from entering my balcony to observing the object until it was gone was about 2 minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be wrong.  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

December 3rd 2019 7:04 a.m. .  ((NUFORC Note:  Starlink satellites?  PD));2019-12-03 07:03:00;4 minutes;December 3rd 2019 7:04 a.m. .  This morning me and my wife we're standing on our back deck having a cigarette and a coffee where we look up in the morning Sky to watch the satellites go by. This morning was a little different I looked up towards the Northeast sky and saw what I assumed was the satellite, so I quickly pointed it out to my wife she then quickly pointed out there was two simular shaped objects flying directly behind  the first one then about a half a second directly behind those two was one more for a total of four in a small cluster moving from the southwest to the Northeast. So at this point while I'm fixated on the cluster of four moving in the North easterly sky she had turned around and look to the Southwest then she started saying quick look there's more there's more so I instantly turned around and look up to the Southwest then we both proceeded to see seven more all following the same flight path as the cluster of four. The cluster of four was in the lead of the seven other crafts,  the cluster of 4 were in the lead by roughly 30 seconds 40 seconds , all of them were travelling at a high rate of speed they definitely definitely definitely were not aircraft In our atmosphere they were definitely outside Earth's atmosphere they were orange in colour well more like a very light white bright kind of doll looking Orange it's hard to describe the colour however we seen 11 of these anomalies all said and told all 11 crafts we're travelling from the Southwest to the Northeast between the hours of 7:04 a.m. and roughly 7:08 to 7:09 a.m. on December 3rd 2019 over the City of Red Deer Alberta.  We never heard a sound we never felt anything these crafts as they went over Red Deer did not leave a trail of any kind of light they just moved over the city fast and they we're not in Earth's atmosphere they were way too high. As a couple we like to sit out on her deck at night and in the mornings and just stare up at our beautiful sky we watch the satellites go by we watch meteor showers shooting stars Etc we've done this for quite a while together something we enjoy something we like to do but this morning kind of shook us both up just a little we talked about it and it has to be the most weirdest things and the most unexplained things we've ever seen in the sky. We together decided you go on a forum and write down what we saw we feel that the universe is not empty of life we believe there has to be something out there other than us. And to think we are the only ones out there in our universe and every other universe would be a huge travesty of human common sense. Thank you for your time and keep looking up at the sky.;52.2593730263158;-113.79446381579
