I'm assuming from my own depth perception and the amount of ground illumination striking it  that the object was about the size of a small plane and flying at about 1000 ft.above me.  I happened to glance up just as I got out of my truck in the driveway and noticed it above the roof of my neighbors house.  At first I thought it was a light colored garbage bag carried in the wind-it was blowing pretty hard-when I realized it was moving at a steep angle to the wind and in a steady, straight line. I saw one object, approximately the same size as a small plane, pass over my neighborhood under the low cloud cover.  It was circular in shape and at least flat on the bottom.  The only illumination was reflected ground light-I live in a city of 60000-and I would estimate the object to have been about 1000' up.  It moved in a steady, straight line to the NNW while the wind was wind was strong from WSW.  I was, and remain, stumped.  I have kept a close eye on the sky for over 30 years and this is the first time I saw something I can't explain, and I've seen some interesting things.  I will try to provide more info on actual weather stats if I can track them down.;52.2593730263158;-113.79446381579
