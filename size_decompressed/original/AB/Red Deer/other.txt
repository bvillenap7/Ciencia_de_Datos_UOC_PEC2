Strange shaped object, no sound, no lights, moving slowly about 20 ft off the deck.;1993-09-17 22:00:00;1- 2 minutes;Strange shaped object, no sound, no lights, moving slowly about 20 ft off the deck. It was a cool September evening, I positioned my yard lounger, wrapped a quilt around me, and lay down on the lounger in preperation to watch the metorite shower as earth went throught the tail of a comet(forgive me for not recalling the exact dates/year or the name of the comet)As I watched the light show I mildly ammused as it was not as good as it had been the year prior. Suddenly, from over my roof top came a dark shape, about 20 feet off the deck/ground, silently and slowly. I can not describe the shape as a disk because it seemed to be more like two disks together one off set from the other, as if one were riding on the other. What startled me was how silent it was and that there were no lights. I always thought UFOs were lighted up and had a hum or something, but this object seemed to absorb the light, only reason I could really see it was the fact that the bottom was not smooth but had various shapes at various levels. I jumped up, scared at first then amazed and excited. I moved back into the wall of my house keeping my eyes on the object as it moved slowly (5 mpha guess) out of my sight passed the roof of the neighbours house. By the time I ran to the street it was well beyond the other houses. There was no tail flame or such as it went out of my sight over the horizon of roof tops.;52.2593730263158;-113.79446381579
Uniform dots of lights, smooth, quick, unique, straight line vector dissappearing into the sky.;2001-09-25 22:00:00;1-2 sec;Uniform dots of lights, smooth, quick, unique, straight line vector dissappearing into the sky. I was sitting outside watching the stars and thought I seen 2 bright flashes of light almost directly above me. I guess it would have been about 10-15 degree south, south east of the zenith of the sky. The flashes were about 5 minutes apart.  This would have happened about 21:45 hours.  The moon was slightly obscured by scattered clouds, but there seemed to be a straight line of clouds just above the moon, and than above that open sky.  I just happened to look away and than look back at the moon.  5 or 6 lights, dots, red bluish, whites light in the form of a boomerang, or wing, with what appeared to be 3 or 4 dots/lights on one side (east) and 1, possibly 2 on the right hand side (west side).  What I thought odd was how fast, smooth and how they moved without loosing their altitude or grouping.   The dots did not disappear behind the cloud rather they disappeared into the sky. My watch read 22:00hrs MST. I am not much of a stargazer, but this did catch my attention.  The dots seemed to come from the north or above me very quickly, but clearly, very clearly.;52.2593730263158;-113.79446381579
Silent, no man baskets, no light, floating in a nortward direction over Red Deer AB about 5:20 PM Jan 25/20;2020-01-25 17:20:00;10 minutes;Silent, no man baskets, no light, floating in a nortward direction over Red Deer AB about 5:20 PM Jan 25/20 I observed an unidentified object floating nice and straight in a northward direction over Red Deer Alberta, Canada, at approximately 5:20 pm on January 25, 2020,  and continued to observe for 10- or so minutes until it floated out of sight. I wondered if it was a hot air balloon or some kind of air ship but there were no lights, nor was there a hanging man basket.  It was silent, being at a distance where I would otherwise normally hear motor noise from a conventional aircraft or drone.  I have pics and a short video.  To me it looked like a socket from a ratchet set with the wider portion of the ‘socket’ downward.;52.2593730263158;-113.79446381579
