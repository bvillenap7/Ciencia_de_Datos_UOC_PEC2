Large triangular craft with 6 pinkish glowing lites = approx 20 seconds;2014-09-22 12:30:00;20 seconds;Large Triangular Craft with 6 pinkish glowing lites = approx 20 seconds At approximately 12:30 am, stepped out on the rear for some night air.  I noticed 2 lights in the sky approaching from the North in a strait southerly direction.  As the craft approached I was able to see a total of 6 lights that were glowing pinkish white - 3 on each wing.  The Craft was a very dark metal color (charcoal) and Triangular in shape.  The nose of the craft had a somewhat rounded front.  I could see that the front of the craft was bridged wing to wing approx. a quarter of the way down the wing span.  The craft made absolutely no sound whatsoever as it traveled directly over our backyard.  I had a very good visual of the craft and had to lean over the deck to see the entire craft due to our covered deck portion on the south end of our home as it fly overhead until out of sight.  The altitude of the craft was very low (less than or equal to what a helicopter would normally fly).  It was larger than a military jet yet resembled the shape of a stealth bomber.  I did not take my eyes off the craft during the entire time, then went inside and drew a picture of what I had seen.;50.584;-113.8705
