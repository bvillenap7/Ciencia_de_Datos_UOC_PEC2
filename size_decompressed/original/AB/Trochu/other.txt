Not an fixed or rotary wing aircraft carrying out authorized flight.;2000-06-25 00:01:00;90 seconds;Not an fixed or rotary wing aircraft carrying out authorized flight. Heavy rainfall, cloudbase approximately 1000 agl.  Object moved at high rate of speed, just below cloudbase, approx. 300+ knots.  Changed course from approx. 310 to approx. 280 then disappeared over the horizon. ((NUFORC Note:  Supplementary message copied below.  PD)) Dear Sir: At midnite on June 24, 2000 myself and two others witnessed a flying object that exhibited controlled flight characteristics.  As a commercial pilot and flight instructor, I know what is and is not an aircraft. Given the extremely poor weather conditions, its location and direction of flight, the complete lack of any sound or proper lighting, and its' very low altitude at a high rate of speed, I thought it would be proper to submit a report to your offices, which we did in July, although for some reason it has not been posted in your reporting database. What is of extreme interest to me personally is the following report: Occurred : 6/25/2000 00:45 (Entered as : 06/25/00 00:45) Reported : 6/29/2000 09:02 Posted : 7/11/2000 Location : CALGARY, AB Shape : Unknown  BRIGHT LIGHT TRACKS FROM WEST TO EAST IN SOLID OVERCAST AT 12:45 AM A LIGHT DECSENDED INSIDE SOLID OVERCAST, THE LIGHT WAS SO BRIGHT IT LIT UP THE CLOUD. THE OVERCAST WAS ABOUT 6000 FEET. IT REMAINED STATIONARY IN THE CLOUD FOR 2 TO 3 SECONDS AND THEN PROCEDED TO TRAVEL FROM THE DIRECTION OF WEST TO EAST. IT DID NOT COME OUT OF THE CLOUD,AND STAYED ON AN EASTERN TRACK UNTIL I LOST SIGHT OF IT. ALSO THERE WAS NO SOUND EMITTED FROM THE CRAFT. I CALLED AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL AND THEY INFORMED ME THAT THERE WAS NO SCHEDULED TRAFFIC IN THE AREA AT THAT TIME.  Someone else in Calgary has apparently seen the same thing, about half an hour or so after we did.  He is correct on the wx at the time:  Calgary's altitude above sea level is 3439 feet, with solid overcast about 1000 AGL in heavy rain and lightning.  The object we saw was below the cloud deck, moving at about 300+ knots, was lit white, had no visible nav lites, made no sound, and carried out two course changes before leaving the area. It was too fast for a helicopter, too low for a jet, and far too quiet.  The nearest military aerodrome that operates anything that would move that quick is CFB Cold Lake, some 400 miles north of our position. Again, the F-18's that they operate would certainly have been audible and have been properly lit, even if for some reason they chose to fly at night in such poor conditions, low to the ground at a high rate of speed. I don't know what your policy is regarding contacts between the authors of the reports you list, but if its' possible I would like to compare notes with the author with what we saw, just on a curiosity basis alone.  I've never witnessed anything like what we saw, and I have lived and breathed aviation in all of its' aspects for as far back as I can remember. Thank you for your consideration Best regards, ((name and title of aviation professional deleted));51.8369;-113.235
