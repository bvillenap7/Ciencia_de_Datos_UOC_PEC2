Bright flash of light in central Alberta.;2017-09-09 21:45:00;1 second;Bright flash of light in Central Alberta. As we were walking around 10:00 pm, the night of the 9th, we both saw a huge, bright flash of light in the sky, looking in the north direction.  The sky was clear that night (could see a few stars already...  It wasn't a beam it didn't travel or hover.  Just a quick bright flash of light.  Like something in the sky had taken a picture of us (example just to give an idea of duration and type of light).;52.4738;-113.737
