Light in Lacombe, Alberta.;2017-12-07 22:15:00;<1 second;Light in Lacombe, Alberta. Low in the southern horizon, just about the roof line, I saw a light go across the sky and turn off.  The light had to have been going fast to make the distance in the very short time line.   It turned off as soon as I noticed it, but kept doing in a western direction. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, principally to confirm the date of his sighting, and he seemed to us to be quite sincere, and sober-minded.  We suspect that he is a highly reliable witness.  PD));52.4738;-113.737
