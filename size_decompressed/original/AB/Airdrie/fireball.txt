I hung up the phone with my husband at about 5:20 PM and was standing before my bay windows and saw this blue light, which almost looked like a shooting star, but it was most definitely within our atmosphere.   I then started to think that it may be an airplane that crashed, a small commuter, because I live in the direct path of the Calgary Airport.  It was not though.   I checked all the local stations and there was no report.   I have mixed feelings on this, but I know something is not normal about what I saw.  I have seen formations when I lived in Florida, but nothing this close.  At least the formation was way further away from my home.again, not sure how I feel right now about it.
