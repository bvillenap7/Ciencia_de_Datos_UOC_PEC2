HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  I had a tel. call from a couple  in Airdrie, AB, and they have informed me that they saw a very strange obj..;2003-08-23 01:20:00;approx: 2 hours;I had a telephone call from a couple who resides in Airdrie, Alberta and they have informed me that they saw a very strange object over a two night period. It also came back on another occasion a few days later but did not stay in the vicinity very long. I talked with the fellow (retied military man) first of all and this is his report he gave me.  The object at one point sat straight over top of their home and was the size of a baseball. The witnesses location is a little south west from Airdrie on the west side of Highway #2. The color on the object changed from white to orange and back again. The object did turn a brilliant blue at one time. The fellow said it was stationary over his home for minutes, then could move from east to west and continue carrying out these types of maneuvers. The fellow actually thought the object was intrigued with the fire they had going in the backyard. He told me the total amount of time the couple watched the object was around two hours. (HBCC UFO Note: Due to the large amount of time the object was witnessed, I asked if the object moved with other astronomical bodies in the sky, and the fellow said no !) He said whatever it was, was moving all over the sky. To make it clear, whatever they were looking at, I was told when they looked away, then looked back at the object, it was in a different part of the sky. Then would make it's move back to where it came from. Both of the witness thought it moved to get out of the way of air traffic as there were aircraft active in that area. They also watched the object move up and down, then move far over to the right, drop down a ways, then move back to the left. (HBCC UFO Note: Both of the folks used the roof of their home as a referrerence point so they knew how far the object moved to the left, right and up and down. At some points in this sighting, they would lose sight of it due to it dropping behind the roof, but it would rise back up again.  He took a guess and figured the object was sitting at approx: 5000 feet and could see the roundness of it. He told me there was sound coming from it. He described it like being a vent people have on the top of their roofs. (the rotating kind, but the sound was at a very low level). Also when the sound was heard, lights would come on around the circumference of it.  I also asked if they had any pets who were with them at the time of the sighting. He said yes. The fellow told me in his words, the three cats went a little squirrelly. He said they seem to cower down, ears fell back and two of then started to hiss.  HBCC UFO Note: The below information comes from the gentleman's wife. I will not give out what her occupation is as it could cause problems if this information came out.  The wife told me the object would have been located approx: 5,000 feet in altitude as she has knowledge of how the aircraft fly in and out of the airport. She said it was certainly hovering around the airport area and the night was very calm and silent. She also confirmed the object did make a strange low pitched noise which she thought was rather eerie. From what she observed, she could see white lights running around the object and another light sitting at the bottom of the craft and it would change from orange to blue. When the object moved in any direction all the white lights went out, but the light at the bottom did stay on, when the object came to a complete stop, the white lights running around it came back on. She said it was definitely round in shape. She said they both thought they were seeing things and did not want to tell anyone about it due to others thinking they were crazy. But it sounds like to me the witnesses had a good seat for an exciting display.  Thank you to both of the witnesses for their report.

HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Completely perfect round sphere going in a  northerly direction. It was definatly NOT a balloon.;2003-09-06 16:00:00;unknown at this time;Hello Vike,  I have been reading in the paper about recent UFO??? sightings seen around Airdrie. I would like to tell you about what I saw back on September 6, 2003.  I had just arrived home after attending the Fall Classic Show & Shine at the Nose Creek Park. It was 4:00 p.m. in the afternoon. I was looking out my livingroom window, which faces east. My home is situated (deleted) of the tracks, in (deleted by HBCC UFO). I noticed a white, completely perfect round sphere going in a  northerly direction. It was definatly NOT a balloon. There was no string attached and it was perfectly round, as balloons are not.  It stayed at a constant speed and was completely unaffected by wind currents. It may have been going about 30-50km./hr. It stayed at the exact same height. I watched it until it disappeared out of sight. I felt like it may have been following along main street, however it may not have been. It was also difficult to tell the size at that distance, but it may have been larger that a beach ball. I have never seen anything like it in my life. Has anyone else mentioned this to you? I would be curious to know if I was the only one who saw it.  Thank you,  Thank you to the witness for the report.

HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Beam of light comes from the sky.;2003-11-22 22:30:00;approx: 20 minutes;Beam of light comes from the sky. A fellow called me on the toll free line to tell me that he and 7 other witnesses observed a beam of light which came down from the night sky. The light was seen from the witnesses location which was in the southwest part of Airdrie, the beam of light was in the northwest part of the sky. Due to homes being in the witnesses line of sight, they were not able to see if the beam actual hit the ground. I asked the witness a few questions about what this beam of light looked like. He said it came straight down, not on any angles nor were there bends in the light. The fellow told me that it had an orange glow to it. The amazing thing is that this beam of light sat in one place for approx: 20 minutes, enough time that some of the witnesses ran in to telephone other friends and family members so they could go out to see this strange event. I also asked if the beam of light lit up any of the area, the witness said no, due to obstacles in their way.  No sound was heard, plus the beam was rather wide, not just a thin beam of light. He said it was moderately cloudy as I wanted to know if any type of object was seen in the area where the light originated from.  No object was noted. No aircraft were visible at the time of the sighting flying through this airspace. I wondered if this may have been a helicopter, but again not a sound was heard coming from the area and I am sure the witnesses, and the others you went out to watch this would have heard the sound if it had been some type of normal aircraft.  Thank you to the witness for their report.  Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.
