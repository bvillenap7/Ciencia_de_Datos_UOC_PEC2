I then noticed about 5 aircrafts in a formation of an arrow, fly extremely fast through the sky. It then disappeared when it went behind the clouds.  I know it wasn't any kind of man made craft because it was travelling way too fast to be something a human could be controlling.  One thing I noticed is that the formation never got out of line.  It was a perfect arrow straight through the sighting.  The objects creating the formation were round white balls of light.;51.3026943820225;-114.030973033708
