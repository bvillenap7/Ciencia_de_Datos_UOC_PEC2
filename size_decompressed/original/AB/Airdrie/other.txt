HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Daylight sighting, light changed into a craft.;2003-08-18 02:30:00;approx: 2 minutes;Daylight sighting, light changed into a craft. I fellow called to report he witnessed something very strange when he was driving up Deerfoot heading towards Airdrie. He watched a small ball of white light cross the highway in the distance a head of him, the ball of light turned in his direction. The witness said he was doing approametly 30 kilometers an hour and observed the light getting closer. All of a sudden the object stopped, still a ways away from him, there it had changed from a ball of light into a craft of some type. He made a guess as to what the altitude of the object might have been at. The witness told me it may have been traveling at approx: 1000 feet.  He added that before the object changed from a ball of light into a strange craft, he noted that it started glistening and shinning brightly and then this is when it started taking on some kind of form of an unusual object. He reported no sound being heard, mind you he was in his vehicle at the time. I also asked if he might be able to determine the size of it, he said when it was in the distance it could have been approx: the size of his small fingers, fingernail. But when it headed in his direction and got very close,  in his words, it was huge.  The object did come to a complete stop as the man passed close by. It sat stationary as he drove some 2 kilometers doing around 20 kilometers an hour. Finally other drivers started honking their horns to get his attention to have him speed up. The man said the reason why he was driving so slow was due to him looking over his shoulder and out the back window watching it. Finally due to his location from the object he lost sight of it.  Thank you to the witness for the report.   Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.
