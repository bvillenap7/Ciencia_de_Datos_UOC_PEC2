This craft should not even be able to fly, let alone being stationary;2005-07-15 14:00:00;none;This craft should not even be able to fly, let alone being stationary This Picture is about 7or8 years old.   I came across it while putting my photos into my computer. I did not see this craft when the picture, my interest was the vein of coal in the side of the embankment. I took the picture in Alberta near Drumheller about 2005.   I have had this photo piled in a drawer a bunch of other photos that at the time I wasn’t to impressed with.  A couple of weeks ago I was sorting through these photos looking for interesting ones to put on my computer.  It caught my attention because of that cloud in the shape of a V and very white.  It appears to not be moving because nearby clouds are not being disturbed. It was probably about 50 to 75 feet to that embankment from where I would have been standing and the embankment is about 5 feet high as are the bushes on the horizon.  I am guessing that the top of the hill is about 30 or forty feet beyond the embankment. I am 73 years old and have never encountered anything like this during all those years.  I would appreciate it if you people could tell me what it is.   Notice that the bottom portion is painted white.  To blend in with a cloud?   Perhaps it even creates it’s own clouds for camouflage?
