There are star size lights that appear stationary for a time, then move or wink out. I have observed tints of red, blue and green.  The lights disappear as dawn breaks. I have observed these colored lights on at least four occasions. At work, it is my job to unlock exits in our building on the third floor.  One morning at 7:10 am in June, I was attracted to a light slightly above the horizon and just beneath a construction crane two blocks away. My first thought was that it was a plane because the light was bright.  It seems stationary and I at first was convinced it was conventional aircraft.  After looking at it for several minutes, the light just disappeared. I thought perhaps the craft had entered a cloud bank, but later realized there were no clouds present.  The mysterous bright light just exploded into nothingness. It is my belief I am being prepared to see yet more of these objects.  At this stage I am curious and seem to accept them naturally without drawing many conclusions. ((Initials deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Stars??  PD));53.4804686567164;-113.86923880597
