Big orange ball of light with glowing orb around the ball. (energy field);2015-05-01 21:55:00;15 seconds;Big orange ball of light with glowing orb around the ball. (energy field) On May 1, 2015, at 9:50 pm, I was taking my dog outside to run around the yard,  as I come around to the front of the house, looking north I first noticed in the distance a small orange light, but as I kept watching the light, it was coming south towards me and was getting larger and larger and at a high rate of speed.  No sound coming from the light and as it got closer I could see a big round orange ball of light with an orb shape glow around it.  I ran back to the house to get my wife to witness this.  At this time I had been watching this for 10 seconds and it should of flu over my yard but as my wife came out to look it had changed direction and was heading to the north east and looked to be gaining altitude at a high rate of speed and disappeared in around 5 seconds after the direction change. I would say it looked like the size of a basketball in the sky, and maybe 300 t0 400 feet in the air?;53.4804686567164;-113.86923880597
