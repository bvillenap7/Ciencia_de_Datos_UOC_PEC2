As I walked home from a friends I looked up into the sky to look at the constillations. I saw an object move swiftly over, Low, No sounds it was in a Triangle V formation. It moved in a westerly direction. The Object passed over head for roughly 30 seconds. Before I lost site. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Dear Director,    Thanks for looking into this your about the only person who has believed my sighting I would have phoned the local RCMP but they would have just laughed. There were no Media stations close to were I live that have a 24 hour line. If you want me to draw the object or anything please ask me too I  would like to make this as vivid as possible. ((END ADDENDUM)) ((SECOND ADDENDUM)) Here are some quick drawings I did on th object. It looks almost like a U2 spy plane. They cant travel that fast that low. ((END ADDENDUM));52.3168;-114.0853
