It did a curly que upwards and vanished.  3 second sighting. After listening to your coast to coast report last night (April 18, 2019), I also seen a high-altitude white object in the sky.  Just a dot really. It than did a curly que up wards and went out of sight.  The sighting lasted only 3 seconds.  I was at a political event at a ranch and waiting for the main speaker.  I was focusing on an eagle or osprey very high up in the sky over the lake.  That is the only reason I seen it.  We were 1 mile from the south west edge of Sylvan Lake, Alberta, Canada.  This happened at 7 pm, April 8, 2019.;52.3168;-114.0853
