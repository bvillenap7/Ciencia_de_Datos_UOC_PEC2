Walking down driveway, in a southeasterly direction, looking at near full moon, spotted bright light object from south heading north under the moon.  Brightness was almost like Jupiter, a near yellow in colour. My initial thought it was a satellite or ISS, but not in correct direction for ISS. -Possibly was a small plane at 1000m in elevation, but no coloured running lights just a bright light that faded after nearly 10 seconds.  Like watching some satellites disappearing into the umbra of the earth Definitely not an airliner. -Possibly it was a satellite, but too fast. -Possibly a meteor but too slow and no tail. I have lived here more than 3 years and make it a habit of watching the skies, and this was odd.;51.7995;-114.6326
