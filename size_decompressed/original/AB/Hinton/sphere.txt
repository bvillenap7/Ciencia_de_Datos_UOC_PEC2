Dark green luminous object dropped outta atmosphere rapidly behind mountain;2019-11-10 22:23:00;3 seconds;Dark green luminous object dropped outta atmosphere rapidly behind mountain Travelling hwy 40 south, at 22:23pm i was a passenger in a pickup truck, the moon lit the night, you can see shadows on the ground.  Perfectly clear night.  What i witnessed lasted 3 seconds.  A luminous dark green similar to the christmas lights on homes zoomed towards the ground behind a mountain at a rapid rate of speed.  Straight down from atmosphere, it never resurfaced or took air that i seen.  Which iam glad because we were only vehicle on hwy, it was shocking and unsettling.dark green moving fast towards ground behind;53.4012;-117.5895
