Hello i was just getting to sleep at 2 am and what i thought was a jet flew over louder then ANY jet i have ever heard. I thought maybe it was just because he flew over our town as fast as possible which is why it was so loud but i stuck my head outside the window to listen to this loud sound that shook my windows and it was completely gone, no sound of an aircraft flying away in the distance..  And it took me literally 2 and a half seconds to get up and peek out the window in curiosity lol. If there is some sort of a like/comment system watch how many people from my town (est 5000) like this post because i am sure EVERYONE heard this i can account for at least 30+ people, family and friends that also heard this and are curious.;54.262;-110.7405
