Went camping with my uncle last night we looked up to see what looked like a bright star in place just above us.  The light slowly headed east then went up and disappeared about two minutes later a row of five lights in a straight line each light a separate entity then went at a quick pace then another five right behind there was absolutely no sound from these crafts.  Each was heading in a north eastern direction we were in a very remote area north of Bonnyville, Ab, not sure what they could be was wondering if anyone else saw this ((NUFORC Note:  String of Space Link satellites.
