I was working on pond 8B at Suncor just north of Fort McMurray. The object caught my eye and at first I thought it was a bird. But when I looked closer I saw a black chevron shaped air craft with sharp 90 degree angles. It was just under the clouds so it had to be several thousand feet high. Judging by the distance it seemed to be quite large. At least the size of a commercial air liner.  It was travelling out of the South moving north. The object continued north until it was over the main plant site (base plant of Suncor) then slowed down and turned very sharply making a U turn and headed south again. It continued south at a slow rate of speed for a while then accelerated rapidly. The object then went out of view behind a small cloud per the south end of pond 8B and Was not seen again. The object was flat and did not seem to have a fuselage or distinctive engines. The sky was scattered clouds with a distinctive ceiling. A solid mass of cloud cover or front ! of some sort was to the north east. I was facing west when I initially saw the object.;56.7048000000001;-111.284605194805
