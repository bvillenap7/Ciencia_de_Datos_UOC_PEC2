They seemed to come back in about 5 to 10 minute intervals and sometimes groups of threes, twos, eights, fours, twos again and also sometimes at a lower altitude...they almost had a diamond or circle with wings look and glowed orange. This is the first time ive ever saw n e thing like this and im glad i was with my buddies or id of thought i was crazy, and i had to go home and go to bed cuz of work early in the morning, but if they are still flying by at the same intervals, then there would be some going by right now as i write this.;56.7048000000001;-111.284605194805
