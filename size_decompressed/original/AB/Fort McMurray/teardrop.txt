Upside down dark brown teardrop craft with needle-like points coming out.;2016-05-05 16:00:00;10 minutes;Upside down dark brown teardrop craft with needle-like points coming out. I'm from Nova Scotia, but I work in Alberta, and back in May 5, 2016, I was sitting in a house in Fort McMurray, Alberta, when I saw (what looked like) a dark brown upside down teardrop, with 4 needle like points (like fingers) coming out of it, with a second dark brown upside down tear drop with two points coming out of it too, slightly lowered beside it, flying together.   It passed in front of me at the far end of my street.  It was about 100 yards away and about 75 feet in the air.  It made no sound and both were about the size of a standard school bus each.  It was a clear day without clouds.  It drifted right across in front of me and drifted off into the horizon, going West.  It came from the East.;56.7048000000001;-111.284605194805
