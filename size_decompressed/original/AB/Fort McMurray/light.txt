Beam of lights over trees in Canada;1982-10-08 22:50:00;8 seconds;Beam of lights over trees in Canada Driving up from Edmonton to Ft Mac, Alberta is a lonely & boring 5 hr. drive - all trees along a stretch of narrow highway. I am reporting this now because it has bothered me even after all these years. It was an overcast under a partial moonlit night. I was driving and my girlfriend and I saw it first then the two back seat passengers acknowledged it. We were silent for about 10 seconds as we watch this object hover just above the trees about 300 meters away and about 75 meters above the ground. It had 2 light source that shown down to the ground. The beam of light moved about as if they were looking for something. About 8-10 seconds later the lights shut off and the object vanished into the clouds very quickly. We could not see the object at all. We were all so puzzled by it. It was definitely not a helicopter with its blue or red blinking lights and to appear in the middle of no where.
