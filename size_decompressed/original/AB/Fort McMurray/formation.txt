Formations of red lights flying across night sky.;2005-08-28 00:30:00;30 mins to hour;Formations of red lights flying across night sky. At 12:30 am on August 28, 2005 while looking to see Mars, myself and my parents notice groups of faint red lights shooting across the sky.  These lights moved very fast and some where in a V-formation, while others were just in an un-organized group.  They were moving in a westerly direction. There was way to many to count. They began to dissappear after about an hour.  The groups ranged from 1 to 25.  At first i thought they were birds but quickly decided against it due to the speed and direction they were flying.  they would stay in formation but each individual light would bounce up or down or side to side while still moving forward. it was not a quick shift, but almost graceful.  they move no sound either. just wisked by.;56.7048000000001;-111.284605194805
