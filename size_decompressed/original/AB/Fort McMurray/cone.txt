A large partcially cone shaperd crafted appaered over a back road when me and my friend were drinking down dirt roads near Ft. McMurry;2002-01-02 08:32:00;2 hours;A large partcially cone shaperd crafted appaered over a back road when me and my friend were drinking down dirt roads near fort McMurray. My friend got out of the car and vanished into thin air and the craft disappeared.  I tried to drive for help but the car wouldnt start and it was too cold to walk. I soon went into a sleep and woke up later with my friend asleep beside me.  We drove back to town and my friend won't admit or talk about anything, he just denes anything happened but can't explain were the lost 2 hours went.
