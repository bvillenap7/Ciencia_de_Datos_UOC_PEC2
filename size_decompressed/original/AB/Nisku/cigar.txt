Long narrow cigar type object without wings or lights in sky at nights;2013-04-09 01:00:00;10 seconds;Long narrow cigar type object without wings or lights in sky at nights As a mobile patrol officer working in Nisku, AB. Always watching the sky as I am interested in UFO's. Stepped out of my truck around 1am.  Before stepping back in i looked up there i heard a humming sound. I noticed a very long but wide object dark grey/black without wings and any lights present fly over quite low straight over my head.  At first it looked like a missile there i did not see wings and it was quite long narrow shaped. In my mind i told myself it must be a plane till i saw it make a long round curve to my left. It left my eyeside right after.  Am in law enforcement for 20-year and know fighter jets and other planes. This was not a normal plane.  It had no wings or lights. I turned on radio and called friends there I assumed it was a missile of any sort. Am not sure what I saw.  The up to 90 degree curve, no lights and no wings confuse me still.;53.3296;-113.5325
