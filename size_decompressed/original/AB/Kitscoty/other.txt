Bright reddish stationary object sighted for approximately 20-25 minutes in Alberta Canada.;2011-02-08 20:38:00;20-25 min;Bright reddish stationary object sighted for approximately 20-25 minutes in Alberta Canada. I was south bound on Highway 897 on 08 Feb 2001 around 20:38 between Marwayne and kitscoty when I noticed the object to the South East of my position.  The object was bright and looked like a triangle with one side horizontal to the ground and the pointy end was part way into a circle.  The object was a reddish orange color.  The object was approximately 100 meters above the ground.  The object looked like it was about 1 cm through the side window of my vehicle.  I stopped on the high way just before Kitscoty, rolled down the window and looked at the object.  It was approximately 1 km directly West of Kitscoty.  It was too still to be a helicopter and had no flashing lights.  Then it made 4 to 5 horizontal circle motions (wobbled approximately half of its width) and stopped.  I made several of these motions in a 5 min time frame.  I got back onto the highway then went south on Highway 16 past Kitscoty.  I still saw the object, then it moved south west in a st! raight line keeping a constant altitude.  I estimate that it went approximately 10 km in about 1 minute before it was too far to see.;53.3335;-110.3388
