The sky was dark and filled with sparkling stars, then high up and off to my right hand side, out of the corner of my eye I caught a glimpse of something bright in the sky.  As I directed my attention to it, I thought, oh, what a beautiful falling star! I quickly braked my vehicle to slow and watch it and it came darting through the sky like falling stars do, then I saw it was a large, intensely bright, glowing, round,green ball, which grew bigger and bigger as it come rapidly closer and closer, and I thought, Oh my god, whatever this is, it's going to crash right beside me... then suddenly it abruptly zig zagged off horizontally like a zee and then shot upward and disappeared from sight.  By this time I had stopped my vehicle.  I looked and looked trying to find where it had gone, but its disappearance was extremely rapid and I saw it no more. Shocked and unnerved, I didn't tell anyone about it for several weeks. It is at the suggestion of my son, I am making this report.;50.3995;-113.2463
