Bright white light, seen moving across treeline, while camping in rocky mountains.;2011-08-26 00:15:00;approx 2 minutes;Bright white light, seen moving across treeline, while camping in rocky mountains. My boyfriend and I were camping, and were staying up late gazing into the night sky, with the campfire low. We had just came from the outhouses, when we saw a very bright whitish light about 200 to 400 feet above treeline. It moved horizontily from right to left, then it seemed to get quite small, and then seemed to fizzle out. There was no sound. The white light was in our view for a couple of mintutes. The night after, we saw a light again, and again from the same area of sky, this time it moved quicker, and dissappeared, the time was between midnight and 1:00 am.Again being in the sky for about a minute. Around the time of 02:00 my boyfriend and I again saw this brilliant light, it was stationary at this time, and we could only handle staring at it for around 40 min.;49.4874;-113.9529
A white object that slowly moved from side to side, it had a white hue and looked like a star in apperance, but moved quite weirdly.;2017-07-16 19:14:00;~16 minutes;A white object that slowly moved from side to side, it had a white hue and looked like a star in apperance, but moved quite weirdly. I was out camping at Hiawatha campground near Pincher Creek, few minutes from Beaver mines.  Me, my little sister and the son of a family friend were going for a walk around the site.  I looked up at sky, which is something I always do when I'm out there.  I saw a circular craft slowly moving from side to side, it was white and had a white hue around it.  It was pretty bright and looked like a star, but how it moved from side to side was nothing of a star. We stayed for about 16 minutes watching it and talking. Around the site there are alot of animals, the craft wasn't above us, it was quite far, it looked more like it was hovering over the trees.
