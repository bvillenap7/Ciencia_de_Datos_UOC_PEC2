Out star gazing as I usually do during the summer.  I have noticed on numerous occasions (pretty much every night so far this summer) a light that when you first notice it looks just like a star but is moving, so I always assume it's a satellite but it acts differently than the hundreds of satellites I see every clear evening, I've counted with my wife 15 of them in a 20 minute period going in every direction you can think.  This star/satellite seems to increase it's light intensity 20X so that it becomes larger than any planet one can see from the earth and extremely bright, I've noticed others reporting the same type of object and I am stumped to identify what exactly it is but once it has intensified it slowly starts to loose illumination and finally will just disappear within a couple of degrees of travel, normally I can follow a satellite for 90-120 degrees with no variation in how it looks.  To try and let you know where I see it most often is west of didsbury at about 30 degrees but I have seen them farther east at about 100 degrees as well.  We even witnessed one that was very large (instead of a pin sized light it was about the size of my pinky nail holding my arm outstretched.) that flashed in varying frequencies flying to the south heading east not intermittent like airplane flashers but more irregular.  I encourage anyone reviewing this residing in the same area to watch the western sky as well as I mentioned it seems I see it/them every clear night I go out and look.  Would love to find out what it is or get some explanation of what it could be.;51.672;-114.1293
