I was on vacation last year in the Rockie Mountains and took hundreds if not thousands of pictures.  Taking soo many images meant it took me a year to go through them unfortunately, however one stood out from the rest.  What I originally thought was dust or water on my lens looked more like a round saucer shaped craft following or being followed by a dark triangular craft.  I took several frames in that location and they only showed up in 1 image. A friend I was with at the time had also lived there in his youth and shrugged it off citing the numerous accounts of seeing things in the mountains.;52.8822;-118.0712
