A strange, colour changing, swaying, pulsing light during an eclipes of the moon in Jasper, Alberta.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sirius??  PD));2008-02-20 20:00:00;1:11;A strange, colour changing, swaying, pulsing light during an eclipes of the moon in Jasper, Alberta. We were out winter camping. I went by the tent to look at the stars and saw this strange light.  It stood out at first because it was the brightest, far brighter then any star or planet.  It was also changing colors, blue, red, yellow, green.  Every color that you can imagine.  Not only was it changing color, but it was moving around.  Like a hovering insect. It was not moving fast, but was swaying slowly, around in circles and up and down. It was also flashing and pulsing. It stayed around for about an hour, and then it was gone. This last part might have been my imagination, but it seemed to be shooting light beams, or maybe a sort of extra large search light.  ps-- This happened during a total eclipes of the moon in the South East part of the sky.
