Orange / yellow glowing wings with no persivible fuselage no sound.;2006-04-19 22:50:00;2-3 minutes;Orange / yellow glowing wings with no persivible fuselage no sound. Object Description: It looked like a bi-plane only consderably larger wings. The wings(??) appeared to glow (orange / yellow) over their entirity from the interior. No fuselage visible. My wife and I were out on our deck and the object approached from the southeast and passed directly overhead proceeding northwest. No sound. Estimate the altitude to be approx. 2500 - 3500 ft. Estimate air speed to be less than 100 knots.  I am a retired Canadian Airforce Chief Warrant Officer and my wife is a household engineer and the biggest skeptic that ever looked into the night sky.;53.7982;-113.6649
