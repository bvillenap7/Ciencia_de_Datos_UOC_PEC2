High speed saucer shaped object spotted over Northern Alberta Canada;2004-07-25 20:00:00;45 seconds;High speed saucer shaped object spotted over Northern Alberta Canada My best description for the object is saucer shaped and it had what appeared to be energy cloud out the blunt end of the back.  I watched and took pictures for approximately 45 seconds then in the last photo I caught what looks like the plume of the craft as it zipped away at high speed.  I know this wasn't a jet liner or helicoptor because of the way it moved.  I was using a Cannon Powershot S50 for the pictures and had the zoom at approximately 9.  I was outside originally taking pictures of the sunset when this caught my eye.  I have 4 pictures in total.  My guess as to distance in picture 1 is approximately 3-4 miles.  It neared to as close as 1 mile then sped away.;53.9518;-113.8955
