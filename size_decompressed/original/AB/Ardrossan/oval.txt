Some time in the summer of 1984,I was living on an acerage outside of ardrossan,alberta.I was about 10 years old and was getting ready ;1984-08-15 19:00:00;2-3 days;Some time in the summer of 1984,I was living on an acerage outside of ardrossan,alberta.I was about 10 years old and was getting ready to go to sleep which was pretty tough going for me because it was still daylight around this time here in the summer.As i was looking out my bedroom window ,i noticed a very strange oval grey shape off in the northwest direction in which i found very unusuall, especially at my age back then!I starred at that object for hours ,trying to figure out how large it was and the possible distance in which it could be.I remember having a babysiter during this time and did not mention anything to this person because i was mad and hated this person for reasons i can not remember.I woke up the next morning,and went outside to look for this strange object in the sky and could not find it,UNTIL !!later on that evening i saw it there in the same spot,hovering completly still far over the distant tree line!I must have seen that object in the sky appear and dissapear about 5 times in 2-3 days if not more!If i was to describe the object,i would have to say that from a distance it was light grey in colour,with perfect black spots on it and an extremly prominent outline to it!It must have been large in actuall size and i remember viewing it through a pair of binoculers various times ,to make sure it was real!!There is no possible way that i could have been the only person to see this object,and will always be curious as to if it had been seen by any of the local farmers or acreages!I know for a fact that it was not a balloon or a star or anything like that,for the fact of it appearing only during day light hours and having a perfect egglike ,and typical spaceship look to it,in which i will always remember.;53.5196;-113.1033
