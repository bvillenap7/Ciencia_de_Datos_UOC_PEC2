6 or 7 circular objects flying in triagular formation;1998-09-13 22:00:00;15-20 secs;6 or 7 circular objects flying in triagular formation On September 13,1998,around 10pm,I was sitting in a lawnchair looking up at the stars.A few stars blinked which caught my attention, When I looked closer I saw 6 or 7 circular objects flyingEast to West in a triangular formation, they were not in perfect formation, a couple of the craft were off just a bit. The city lights were illuminating them enough to tell they are a light color,a dull silver or grey. I'm not sure how high up they were but they were below cloud cover. I would guess the size of them at 15-20 feet in diameter. They made no sound. They were flying fast but I was still able to watch them for 15-20 seconds.I am 32 and have lived in Calgary my whole life, married with a 6 month old daughter and 3 yr old son. We operate a mid- sized trucking business based in Calgary. I am not an avid star watcher I just happened to be looking up at the right time.;51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698
Round shiny object with flashing light or revolving in the sunlight crossed behind passenger jet.;2001-09-14 17:30:00;5 min.;Round shiny object with flashing light or revolving in the sunlight crossed behind passenger jet. We were in a car, travelling within city limits. A large jet had taken off from Calgary International Airport about 10 miles away. The jet was travelling North to South. As I looked at the jet I noticed a round shiny object travelling East to West, crossing the jet's path behind it. It was travelling fast and seemed to be blinking or revolving with the sun shining on it. We passed some trees and parked but the object was out of sight. Shortly after (one minute) a helicopter made a large circle in the same area.;51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698

About 10:30 PM I was sittin on my computer which is right by the window. I looked to my left out the window and I saw an extremely bright circular light. At First I though it was a reflection from our glass ball hall light projecting onto the window, until I discovered that the hall light was turned off. The object the began to move in wierd patterns. After about 1 minute it suddenly dissapered. At this point I my heart was racing.;51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698
A bright circle traveling in the daytime. First South and then another one two hours later traveling North.;2005-04-20 16:00:00;10 min.;A bright circle traveling in the daytime. First South and then another one two hours later traveling North. At 4pm on April 20th 2005 I was in my back yard with my kids enjoying the weather. There was not a cloud in the sky and I've been watching planes and their contrails. I was following one jet that was directly above me and heading West. Watching the plane a circular object crossed its path heading South. The object reminded me of watching satellite at night. It was traveling at a similar speed as the plane I was watching before. It appeared brighter than the satellite I've seen at night and if it was night it would of been as bright as the brightest star. Seeing the object got me excited so I ran upstairs to my bead room to get my camera. I grabbed it and ran back down and managed to take 3 pictures before the batteries died in the camera. I watched the object continue to move south until it came too close to where the Sun was in the sky. After that I couldn't see it anymore.  At 6pm the same day I brought home some Pizza for my family to eat in the back yard for supper. My family was already out side waiting for me. As I came out the door I looked up and seen another object that looked the same as the first one but was instead traveling North. I quickly pointed it out to my wife. We watched it continue North for a minute until it went behind a cloud and we lost sight of it.  I believed it was possibly only a satellite, it did cross the sky similar to one. Two days after I was convinced that it was not one. Again I was in my back yard and I found another one North West in the sky. This time it was not moving. It stayed in place for about 4 minute until it vanished.;51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698
Three lights circling one another.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible advertising lights.  PD));2006-07-09 00:00:00;2 hours;At about 1:00 p.m. sunday july 09/2006. I had gone out to have a cigertte and was relaxing in a lawn chair and happened to notice a round metallic object hovering in the north sky. When I looked again it had three other round object circling it. They seemed to circle around the first one in a steady pace.This lasted for five or ten minutes.  Then the three began to spead out away from the fisrt one in a triangular pattern. I continued to watch as the three objects fanned out to my guess would be 40 to 100 miles from the original circle. Then the three seperated and began to circle each other over a 2 hour period.This covered approximately 300 to 400 miles of sky. Then around 2 p.m. they regrouped in the north sky and one by one faded into I would assume would be space as the first stayed for a few more minetes.

July\Aug\Sept-06.White lights over Calgary. strang thing in field;2006-08-09 00:00:00;seconds;July\Aug\Sept-06.White lights over Calgary. strang thing in field My boyfriend and I have been going out every night in Calgary A.B for the past 3 months july aug and sept. we have been witnessing white circular objects that we call sparks due to their look.Intense bright white light. At first we thought that the where shooting stars, but they were not acting the same and left no trail behind.We know they are not sattelites we watch for thoes all the time,and they don't dim from being out of the suns light.They are very fast,and can make extream vector changes. they go dimmer and brighter and seem to know when you are paying attention,they will dim until you can no longer see them. We have seen them single, and also one time two together. Also we have seen them speed up to regular air craft then slow and go a different direction.We have been seeing these in all areas of calgary se down macloud and west off glenmore.and at diffrent times late evening and early morning 1030 pm to 500am .We have herd only a hum sound a few times. Twice in one spot we had a hair raising feeling. The second time we saw a weired white shape or shadow in a feild that was Followed bye two strange noises that sounded like a mix between a horses noise when they breath out and the air viberates off their lips , a throte rummble and a angry snake hiss all mixed in one sound .I stoped lookingmade him role up my window I was scared. We turned the car to point the head lights in to the field. My B.F said that the thing took off at an extream speed through the fieled when he started the car.We could not see it and the feeling was gone we left.The first time we went we were both uneasy like you are aware of bad intent and your body is giving you warning. It was not just fear of unknown.It was a strong feeling to leave it took alot not to speed away it was such a scary feeling. We herd shuffling sounds in the feild and a thump on the fence post near us we left, we were both shook up.We will continue to go out we are planing to bring some friends this weekend.we brought a video camera th! at I had charged the battery all day and tested before we left but it's charge was gone when I went to use it.I will try again on camera our friend have high power benocculars and night vision glasses not to metion some really bright flash lights. I hope to get some concreate evidence on bothe the lights in the sky and the shape in the field.;51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698
I looked out the back main window which faces WSW towards the geographically.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probably Venus.  PD));2007-01-18 18:15:00;5 Minutes;As I entered my bedroom, I looked out the back main window which faces west-southwestrly towards the geographically NW/SE angling Rocky Mountains.  The sun had set almost west-northwest of my line of sight it was dusk condition (still light enough, but not dark - about 30 min to 1 hour before darkness was to set in), and that is when I saw the bright circular object on the SW horizon, just above and slightly beyond the mountain peaks.  It was setting slowly behind the mountains again, it was bright enough that no stars or other planet(s) were visible.  At first I thought that it might have been Venus, but it seemed too low on the horizon to be Venus, and it was sinking faster than any planet's movement rate across the sky and/or horizon. It's size seemed quite large (3-4 times larger in diameter than any planet which would be visible via the naked eye - possible visual refraction error due to the object being located pretty much right on the horizon (objects look larger on the horizon, i.e. - the sun looks bigger as does the moon when setting or rising), and the distance had to be at least one hundred miles away, over the mountains to the southwest (beyond downtown Calgary), which are about 50 miles away from Calgary due west, as the crow flies.  The object was circular, had a very bright white colored light, moved through a roughly 5 to 10 degrees vertical arc within 5 minutes. I watched it until it totally disappeared out of my sight.  The only other option that I come up with what it could possibly have been is the space station?  Regards. ((NUFORC Note:  Venus is visible in the western sky at the time indicated.  The ISS does not set on the western horizon.  Probably Venus.  PD));51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698

My best guess would be that it was at least 80,000 feet high, and I could not hazard a guess on its size.  I had never seen any star and/or planet at that location at that time, so, that is why it seemed a little strange to me. The color was originally a flickering bright electric blue, but then started to fade into a white dull glow. The ten minute episode had the light bright royal blue color turn into a fading dull white color before it just disappeared. There were other stars in the sky that night, but with the thin layer of high cirrus cloud over our area, the stars all seemed to be not as bright as usual, and that is why I found the brightness of the “object” strange and a little odd. I pointed it out to my wife, who had the same comment, i.e. – it was quite a bright blue color, like something very electric.;51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698
Fast hard high altitude maneuvers;2007-03-16 08:45:00;3 minutes+-;Fast hard high altitude maneuvers Stopped pickup and got out, waiting for friend, looked up... noticed a jet in the sky, and saw what I thought was a satellite crossing the plume behind the jet.  Noticed that the 'satellite' was really moving fast compared to the normal amount of time for satellites.  Object then changed course in a tight curve (at that speed, current tech, gotta be about a 5 - 9G turn at what sure looked like 3,000+ mph) and proceeded straight again for about 10 seconds where it met up with another 'satellite'.  At this point the two objects started doing a criss-cross of flight paths, while making another high speed tight turn (tight being defined as hold out hand at arms length, spread thumb and forefinger, the turn occured within that space at arms length...tight turn.).  Both objects continued criss-crossing each others flight path while making two more turns 'together' before I lost them in the light pollution of the city.  Objects were dimmer than the airliner I initially spotted, no visible running/collsion light on either of them, no visible plume like the airliner.  Airliner was at an estimated 25,000 - 30,000 feet in altitude (assuming that would be normal over Calgary, AB when not stopping) and the first object was noted to pass behind the plume from the airliner.  It is possible that it could be modern fighter craft, but it would have to be one tough model of aircraft to execute that kind of turning.  If so, very impressive...and very impressive G-Suits too considering...;51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698
It was  round and red and  would emit fire like flares and travelled slowly but surely.;2008-07-18 20:30:00;10 mins?;It was  round and red and  would emit fire like flares and travelled slowly but surely. I was outside helping my husband build a deck from the kitchen back door when I looked up to the sky and watched some seagulls flying about, they were quite high up into the sky and as I thought to myself that they were quite high up and why, when I suddenly saw a round and red object slowly making it's way northeast.  My husband could not see it but as I watched it and told him about it, it seemed to light up with fire just like a balloon and basket save there wasn't a basket and it would have been far too high for one. It was red then firey then red but it kept traveling at the same velocity.  I didn't watch it until I could no longer see it but later that evening, a few hours after, I saw it again and this time it criscrossed itself going from the south to the north..... very interesting!! Still as slow but sure making it's way somewhere. I've never seen anything like it. It wasn't a weather balloon because we both have seen one twice crossing our yard and it was quite low so that we were able to see exactly what that was! What do you think it was?  Thank you so much!;51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698
Circular UFO Spotted at High Speed over Calgary 2008;2008-08-22 01:00:00;15 minutes;Circular UFO Spotted at High Speed over Calgary 2008 I was visiting from the USA, and staying at a friends towbhome in NW Calgary, Area of Bowness. I woke up and stepped outside, the backyard faces south. I could  see downtown.  I noticed a plane coming in from the SE quadrant of the city, heading north. Something caught my eye to the SW of the city, heading north. It was quite a bit south of Calgary, and was moving at a high altitude. I compared height and speed between this object and the commercial plane., through out the observations.  By the time the jet was on the SE corner of DT Calgary the object was past DT.  It was a dull grey, circular shape, no lights, no sound. Was moving north at an incredible high speed. No external lights,  it appeared to be illuminated from the inside. No tail exhaust, or sound was heard.  By the time the commercial jet was east of DT  Calgary, the UFO was far north of the city ad disappeared.  It was a clear night, no clouds. As a person who studied Physics, incredible. This was not reported until now, as I did not know where to report. Thanks.;51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698
