Flash of light seen in the south Calgary sky.;2012-05-31 12:30:00;3 seconds;Flash of light seen in the south Calgary sky. At approximately 12:30 am I observed a big flash of light 168 degrees south from my location, and about 35-40 degrees from the horizon.  The flash was about the size of a dime at arms length. It lasted about 2 seconds and quickly faded to a pin prick of light then disappeared.;51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698
