Phoenix Lights observed in Calgary Canada 4 days after the initial sighting;1997-03-17 01:30:00;3 minutes;Phoenix Lights observed in Calgary Canada 4 days after the initial sighting In the early morning hours of March 17, 1997, I returned home from work around 1:30 am MST. As I was coming up to the side entrance of my house I looked up to see a triangular object moving slowly from SW to NE.  I lived at that time in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.  The Calgary airport is in a north easterly direction about 10 miles away.  It is not unusual to see airplanes’ coming into land in this area of the city, what is unusual is that the object was only 200 feet above my head, whisper quiet, and had no landing gear extended beneath it.  Also, the speed it was travelling, about 30 mph, would have stalled the engines had this been a jet aircraft.  Most aircraft when landing power up the engines to prevent a stall from happening and the engine sounds are very distinct. In addition, I noticed only two white lights on and pointing straight down.  One light was located at the front of the triangle, the other on the right end.  The lights reminded me of car head lights the same color white but only larger and much farther apart.  I estimate the length on each side to be greater than 30 feet. At the time I believed the object sighted wasn’t an aircraft.  I scanned a channel on TV recording landings and departures of aircraft at the airport.  The Calgary airport I believe has restricted landing and departure times between midnight and 5am. There was no scheduled arrivals’ showing on screen. I am a regular listener to Coast2Coast and very soon after I learned of a similar object that was seen in Phoenix on March 13, 1997.  I eventually pulled up a photo on the internet of what is now known as the Phoenix Lights.  The photo showed a triangular object with a white light in each corner, but was much higher in the sky.  Phoenix is almost due south of Calgary about 1500 miles.;51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698
Shape shifting object;2003-06-02 01:00:00;30 seconds?;Shape shifting object We were sitting on top of the hood of my brother's car, watching the interesting cloud formations through the light pollution from the city, south-east and east of our postion (Car facing south). South-South-west of our position, we saw a triangular formation of lights, (3 in total, at each corner I suppose). The object was moving irratically (so we thought). Up, left, down, right, and quite quickly. We became exited and nervous, trying to decide what it was. It was undoubtably moving towards us, but not directly (moving irratically). The object was making no noise. We all jumped off the car as it got closer. At this point it was probably still at least a mile or two away. Suddenly, we each noticed that it was changing shape. The upper light moved down towards the others, which spread themselves, and it was now moving in a linear motion, with the lights blinking, and it now undeniably resembled an airplane, sound and all. We were shocked and amazed at this transformation. None of us could deny its behavior before the change, nor expain it, before or after. I felt and still feel strong emotion and watering eyes when I think about it. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698
Three bright lights moving in a triangle formation in a low altitude;2003-09-10 21:50:00;4 to 5 seconds;Three bright lights moving in a triangle formation in a low altitude The sighting happened when I was walking home from a bus stop last night. It was a quiet street. Something caught my eyes in the sky above me. When I glanced up, I saw 3 bright lights (I thought they're stars at first) in a triangle formation moving at a fairly low altitude. By low altitude I mean an altitude where helicopter might fly at (not plane). My second immediate thought was they could be Canadian geese simply because of the triangle formation and the low altitude they're flying at. Only when I begun to notice the speed that thing was flying at and when I starting to make out the underlying shape of the object, I dismissed the geese theory and I was certain it was somekind of aircraft. Since it was moving at a very quiet demeanour, I basically ruled out helicopter. In addition, I just want to mention that those 3 bright lights weren't blinking at all. Hence, it couldn't be a commercial plane in my opinion. Now, I don't necessary believe that this object is from out of space. It could be some military spy craft from US for all I know (I don't think Canada can afford something like that). But it sure gave me an interesting experience. One last note, the object was flying towards the North-West direction before I lost sight on it.;51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698

Vertically oriented boomerang shaped object observed over city.;2006-04-08 21:38:00;23 minutes;Vertically oriented boomerang shaped object observed over city. Spotted this boomerang shaped object very high over the Western part of Calgary, Alberta, Canada around 9:38 pm.  The approximate latitude and longitude of the object are as follows:  Latitude: 51 degrees 4 minutes 19.08 seconds Longitude: 114 degrees 08 minutes 34.21 seconds   A picture was taken with a digital camera, a Fujifilm Finepix E510.  Camera zoomed to its fullest extent.  The object appeared several hundred meters high, and more than a kilometer distant.  There was no way to exactly approximate the size of the craft against visual ground references.  For approximately 23 minutes I observed this object very slowly move south to north approximately 10 km.  At around 10:00 pm I went to bed, as the craft had moved to the North and was blocked off by houses in Calgary.  There was no sound or contrail from the craft.;51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698
Triangle UFO's.;2009-07-10 11:00:00;20 minutes;triangle UFO's While in my back yard I see two White Triangles moving across the sky one going North to South the other West to East. The sky was clear and sunny. The two UFO’s stopped above the airport for about 10 minutes then continued on. There was no noise and no trails.

I was lying on my hammock and I saw three large lights travel across the clear night sky then disappear.;2014-08-01 23:55:00;5 seconds;I was lying on my hammock and I saw three large lights travel across the clear night sky then disappear. I was lying on my hammock late at night staring up.  I saw three thick yellow lights go across the dark sky together.  The light were kinda weaving between each other as the distance between each of the lights changed.  I jumped up out of the hammock and walked across my deck to track the three light but they quickly disappeared.   The lights covered a large section of the night sky as they travelled.  The three lights travelled from 11 o'clock to the 1 o'clock across the night sky in like 5 seconds, then they were totally gone.  Afterward I looked around the sky and I could see two airplanes.  The airplanes were totally different.  They moved much slower and the airplanes had flashing red/blue/white lights.   The UFO that I saw was not an airplane.  It was fast and it disappeared.  Airplanes do not disappear.  Airplanes travel in a straight line forever.;51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698
