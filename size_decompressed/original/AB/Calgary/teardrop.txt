Glowing stars scattered over Calgary Airport.;2018-08-20 00:00:00;15 minutes;Glowing stars scattered over Calgary Airport. Last night I looked out my window and there was all these star like lights and there were several of them, I thought it was birds from a long distance but theu were moving too fast and the were controled, there was at least 20 of them, they were dropping from the sky and moving back up again and it was right over Calgary airport or close by,  I know it wasn't birds they were moving very fast up and down left to right it almost looked like the was an air fight between different crafts.  I couldn't take pictures because it would just be all black and they were too far away.;51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698
