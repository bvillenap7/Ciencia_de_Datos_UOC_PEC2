((NUFORC Note:  The witness has provided several photos of three friends, with the skyline of Calgary in the background.  The photos have short light streak.  Our first guess would be that the streaks are caused by the lights on airliners, but that would require that the photos be time-lapse photographs, which some of them do not appear to be.  Rather, they are flash photos.  We do not know what the streaks were caused by.  We will send them to a photoanalyst to see what he thinks.  PD));51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698

Strange Huge Shiny Object in the Sky.;2014-09-21 11:00:00;1 minute;Strange Huge Shiny Object in the Sky Hello! First of all I am a non-beliver in UFO, I watch sometimes shows about it and I thought is some advanced technology made by humans. But today I was with my wife on Stoney Trail, Calgary coming from Northeast towards Southweast.  The day was sunny,a beautiful day,while I was driving,my wife observed 2 objects very far on the sky kinda close to where the sun was located and she told me(i was driving) : ....hon,look in the sky the two shinny big objects connected.... that time she caught my attention.The object that I observed was kinda cigar shape and it was over 20 Km distance from us.The object was so huge and fast,very fast.It had a strange shinny look,like the light was comming from inside,not a reflection of the sun.I saw it for maximum 1 minute then in  2 - 3 seconds became smaller and vanished in thin air.Me and my wife were surprised by the size and speed.  The time was arround 11 am.  We started to look at airplanes to see if is worthed to report this.  All airplanes look totaly diferent in the sun reflection for all sizes.;51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698
