East of the city of Calgary, an object in the early morning sky (8:55 AM) caught my wifes attention appeared to be a bright star at first. As the object moved across the sky it developed a vapor trail. This oddity prompted my wife to grab our VideoCam and as a result we have film of the event. My wife & son also viewed the object through binoculars appeared to be a fireball coming down. The video footage shows a glowing object seperate from the vapor trail as it nears the earth...leaving a corkscrew shaped vapor trail behind before it disappears below the tree line. It appears to have crashed whatever it was. The object appeared quite large considering the distance from our house. We have allowed the video to be viewed by a newsreporter & a scientist who could not explain this event. Supposedly a meteor would have come down much faster than 4 minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  We agree that it could not have been a meteor, if it was visible for 3-4 minutes.  We suspect a high-altitude jet aircraft, leaving a contrail behind it, but that is only a guess.

two fireballs and one star;2017-12-18 01:00:00;5 minutes;two fireballs and one star It was winter 2017, i went outside with a fellow resident. he sat down at 1 of the benches on our buildings patio. I stood instead of sit and staired out east into the night sky. it snowed a little that day and were remnants of low hanging clouds. i could see several miles into the stars. as i stood watching one star. it was about 7-8 miles away because i knew the approximate distance because the star out east came several miles toward me ,at that time i could tell it  moved into earths atmosphere and just stopped about 5 miles away from me. at that time i asked my roomate if he was watching he said no. i knew it wasnt the space station because it came to a halt. i was going to look away when all of a sudden it darted south at an incredable speed. i was going to turn around when 2 fireballs went back and forth through some low lying clouds just 100 meters from me. they went south then reappeared going north. they were completely round about 25 foot diameter.  another thin they were burning and each had a central flame and the flames stood up and didnt bend with movement. there was an errie silence like the quiet after fireworks.i had a sense, the original star could see me watching it from quite a distance. my friend was facing away at the time and so there goes my witness. after a period of a year i aquired severe arthritus, in my  knee and a hole in my other foot down to the bone,also cellulitus in both legs. i was highly athletic most of my life. this is before covid i am still wondering what the fireballs were sent to warn me either about getting imobile or somthing else i dont know. i have had 3-4 interaction with ufos since 5 years old.there where several times in my life which were quite substantial and hard to beleve. the incidents that happened to me in my youth are worth know. both my parents died when i was 9 years old and always felt personal with my experiences;51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698
