STRANGE OBJECT SPOTTED OVER THE CITY OF CALGARY;2002-10-19 17:50:00;10 mins;STRANGE OBJECT SPOTTED OVER THE CITY OF CALGARY My boyfriend and i were walking to the rail transit system in mid Calgary when we noticed a flying object in the air.  It was shaped like an egg, and from time to time it changed to a dimand, circle, etc.....  It had three colours (red, black, white) that changed continuously throught the craft.  The craft moved thoughout the air, horizontally from north to south - gradually going higher and higher into the atmosphere.  It made no sound.  Both myself and my boyfriend had never seen anything like this in our lives.;51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698
small object from SW to N. 30-35 degress above the horizon - dispersed into 9 -12 egg-shaped low luminous objects (<2seconds);2007-04-12 22:47:00;<2 seconds;small object from SW to N. 30-35 degress above the horizon - dispersed into 9 -12 egg-shaped low luminous objects (<2seconds) At approximately 10:45pm on April 12/07, I was outside on my patio deck, which faces towards the East.  It was an exceptionally clear night sky and I was impressed by the clarity of most of the brightest stars in the Eastern sky, including Regulus, which is the first star I was able to identify.   I was about to come inside after a couple of minutes of stargazing, when I noticed a very subdued and somewhat translucent object appear in the Southern Sky above the angle of my garage roof that caught my attention for just a second or two, due to its very fast South to North motion in the sky.  It appeared as a single object and then rapidly dispersed into several, 9 to 12 egg-shaped, very uniform objects that scattered in shotgun like pattern and then completely disappeared.  I would estimate the angle above the horizon and my garage roof to be about 30-35 degrees was unusually horizontal and low to the horizon for a meteoric atmospheric contact.  I have witnessed hundreds of meteor showers over the years and have seen countless satellites in the night sky.  Most of these types of observations have had a distinctive brilliance or very noticeable luminosity to them.  In this particular case, which only lasted a couple of seconds, had a relativity low luminosity and certain amount of translucent quality to it. I suppose this event could most likely be classified as a low angle, low mass, meteoric atmospheric contact, which didn’t have a lot of rarefaction to it and thus very low luminosity or brilliance as most of the meteoric displays that I have witnessed in the past, however, this even I would consider to be of importance due to the uniformity of the object and dispersion pattern and its low level luminosity and translucence that I have never before seen in the sky.  After this occurred, I came inside to note the time on the clock on the stove, which was 10:47pm.  I went outside again, to see if there were any more meteoric activity, when I noticed a cloud formation in the Eastern sky , above the city, which wasn’t there previously.  This cloud formation was very small and somewhat rectangular and eventually disappeared in a matter of minutes.;51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698
White beam of light scanning me like a book during the day playing tennis with my daughter;2019-01-01 13:00:00;7 minutes;White beam of light scanning me like a book during the day playing tennis with my daughter This happened back in the beginning of January 2019 my daughter and I went to play tennis because the weather was nice and in the middle of our playing I noticed a white egg type craft hovering around our tennis court just off to the side about 400-500 feet up  and  then it came closer over head I asked my daughter if she could see that in the sky she said yes she could then I look up …. I see a beam of white light shine down towards me and into my face I look up into the light and it was amazing I was in a beam of light that blocked all other light around it… I saw little stings of light moving horizontally all most like when you see dew drops on a spider web in the shining sun and there where moving left to right and right to left it was hard to comprehend what I was seeing but I still remember it vividly months later and it gives me goosebumps thinking about it now but I know it wasn’t ours….After I looked up at the beam I felt like it read me and it only! took a few seconds then it left our sight within 5 seconds heading straight up;51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698
