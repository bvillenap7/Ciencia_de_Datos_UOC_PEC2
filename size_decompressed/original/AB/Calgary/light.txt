On the evening of March 27th , I was looking up towards the moon it was a clear sky that evening and it was a crescent moon a few small clouds in the night sky and as i was looking towards sagittarius belt i saw what i thought to be a shooting star until i saw the 2nd one parallel to it at the same pace.  Way too high and way to fast to be any man made aircraft, they went across my field of view the one towards the south started to fade i thought shooting star??  but   it came back on and they both proceeded northwest and both faded out of my sight.;51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698

Two consecutive night 1999 Orb sighting + possible horse mutilation news story in same area;1999-10-18 21:00:00;3/4 seconds;Two consecutive night 1999 Orb sighting + possible horse mutilation news story in same area In Oct 1999, I was training for night mountain bike racing in Bowmont Park, Calgary.  The events occurred two consecutive evenings. Oct 18 and 19, 1999. The first eve, Oct 18,1999, I left my home after sunset to ride in a natural area with rolling hillsides 60 -120 feet above the Bow river, for approx. 1hr.  If I were in the other side of the valley, I would be visible in the vast dark unlit hillside. I had a light on my helmet and handle bar.  I rode into a valley that has waterfalls and a lookout up some steps from the bottom of the trail beside the bluff.  I left my bike against the stair and walked up to the lookout that viewed west to the small hamlet of Springbank, Alberta and the Rocky Mountains beyond. As I glanced I blinked what I thought was Venus, really bright in the sky, where it was at that time in the SW Sky only in February here.  I blinked at the same time I noticed it and it wasn't there. Not a speck, just the lighter stars of the night. I said meh, that was my eyes and the lights messing with me and COMPLETELY disregarded it.  Went home and forgot it. The next night it was training time again.  I left my home near same time 8pm and rode the exact route I did as the night before, timing myself as I trained.  When I arrived at the bottom of the steps the light (Venus) that I had literally completely forgotten came to mind.  So I shut my helmet light off, which I had done as I reached the top step and noticed Venus the night before. And there was Venus! Bright and almost shimmering in purples and greens and whites and then with a flash I clearly remember, it streaked up into the sky leaving a streak and was gone is a millisecond. I literally SCREAMED at it I SAW THAT!! I was alone. It was almost like it realized I was seeing it.  I'll never know. But I rode home amazed and life changed because I can never unsee that.  (It was a dejaVu when I saw the Jerusalem Temple Mount event.  Exactly like that video. If it's hoaxed , they did it exactly like I saw alone that night. The story got even more strange when the next week, the RCMP reported a brutal sick horse mutilation on a ranch in Springbank Alberta, directly below where spotted the orb as I would describe it. The week prior and they were looking for some sick individuals. The story was on the CFCN local television news.  I tried to find the story but I cannot locate it in their archives but with some resources this could be verified. My name is ((name deleted)) and I swear this statement to be the truth, so help me God. Thank you for your time.;51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698

HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Three red lights quickly.;2004-04-04 22:00:00;6 seconds;Three red lights quickly. Full Description of event/sighting: I was in my hot-tub enjoying the night sky looking at planets and stars and such when I noticed a faint red dot flying away from me going west. At first I thought it was a plane but the dot's red color didn't seem to flash, it retained it's colour perfectly as it flew. It was when it started going back and forth as it flew west that i knew it wasn't a plane or helicopter. It was fairly low on the horizon so it was far yet it sped back and forth FAST. The speed and manuverability of it stunned me. Then when I knew this thing wasn't explainable, another two red dots flying in formation quickly joined up with the first and they all sank below my line of sight because trees were in the way. I hopped out of the tub and ran to where I could see, but they were too far. All of this happened in around 6 seconds...these little dots were moving way too fast for any vehicle I know of. I would be interested to hear if anyone else might have seen this.  Thank you to the witness for the report.

The lights had an aura or halo around them. In other words, the lights brightened the sky around them. The lights seemed to be travelling toward me as I stared at them  from my car. A disturbance or flow of energy was visible around the lights as the moved. Then they appeaerd to turn in on themselves and vanished. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

flashing;2008-01-12 20:50:00;40 minutes;While walking home from a party with a friend I noticed a flashing light in the sky.  My friend also noticed the flashing light.  The light flashed red, yellow and blue.  The way this light/ Unidentified Flying  Object moved was in a up and down pattern.  The light moved along the sky horizontally for about 10 minutes then dropped down rapidly and went back up to the same altitude in 3 seconds.  It repeated this up and down pattern for 40 minutes, after this 40 minute time period the object rapidly increased altitude and disappeared.

lights over calgary;2008-09-29 00:00:00;10 min;lights over calgary from our drive we saw two lights pretty close to each other and very big and bright, not flashing so not your obvious plane. One moved to the west away from us, the other to the east right above us. It was higher than a plane would normally be but still appeared big with no noise. It moved overhead and appeared to slow down almost coming to a stop, moved in a strtaight line very very slightly to the right and moved on picking up speed but never moving overly fast....then poooph, it was gone. During this we also thought it strange that we saw 3 shooting stars and 3 satalites........anyone else see anything.

bright light shot upwards in sky;2009-09-12 22:00:00;90 seconds;bright light shot upwards in sky Saturday, September 12, 2009. My wife and I were in the back yard of our home in south Calgary around 10pm, looking west I noticed a steady star sized light low in the sky. I watched this for about 1 minute before mentioning this to my wife as being strange as I figured it must be a plane heading eastward, but had never seen this particular flight path before. The light grew in size considerably until it appeared about twice as bright as the brightest star in the sky, just a steady white light,at no point could we hear any noise from the object. it then began a fast vertical accent very quickly in the sky until it vanished.  The entire event lasted about 1 ½ minutes. It only took about 5-10 seconds for the light to go from its brightest point to a pinpoint then vanishing.;51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698
7-8 UFO's and a pterodactyl sighting.;2010-03-29 20:45:00;10 seconds;7-8 UFO's and a pterodactyl sighting. On Monday March 29th 2010,my fiancé and I were on our balcony in Calgary, Alberta, Canada looking up to find Saturn.  (Apparently this was the night we were most likely to see it.)  We live in the downtown area and were looking west towards the mountains. My fiancé pointed out a dim orange light very high in the sky.  The light then split into about 7 or 8 orbs and started to travel north, north east.  There was no sound and they were traveling much faster than planes.  (Which we see all the time).  They traveled across the entire sky and started to separate and finaly dissapeared into the sky. The whole event happened in about 10 seconds, there was no time to get a camera.  If I didn’t see it myself, I would have never believed her. With that being said, I have another sighting to report on her behalf.  Two months ago at about 6:30am, she saw something flying in the dimly lit sky that resembled a pterodactyl.   Yes I am aware that they are extinct!  So of course I had a hard time believing her.  She said it was the size of a small plane and it was flying at a relatively low altitude.  It looked as if it were carrying a large animal by its legs.  An animal the size of a bear or cow.  She said she saw it for about 6-8 seconds and then it disappeared.  We are baffled as to what it could be.  And in case you were wondering.  ..we don’t use drugs.;51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698

Calgary Orb streaming across the night sky, disappearing into warp field;2011-02-21 00:45:00;10 seconds;Calgary Orb streaming across the night sky, disappearing into warp field I was walking back home across the snow covered football field in Christie Park, in the middle of the night around 00:45 am, I then decided to do a bit of star gazing, I don't know why something struck me that I should be looking at the stars at that moment. As I observed at the stars in the South I suddenly saw a fairly large ball of light, perhaps around twice as large as the stars in the sky, lit up out of no where, then moved across the sky to the west and down slightly towards the horizon, at an incredible speed. It was the fastest thing I had ever seen in the sky, I usually look up at the night sky and see airplanes and observe their speed, size, distance and other statistics so I can distinctly know what I'm seeing. The object that I saw moved I'd say at least 5 times faster then any commercial airplane. I only saw the objects for perhaps 7-10 seconds, it was moving quite fast, and at the end of it's trajectory it looked like it had opened a sort of warp field, and disappeared into it.  The warp field was slightly larger than the object, as it opened it looked as if it was webbed or had a certain structure to it like waves.  It was sort of grey in color.  The warp field was only there for a split second prior to the object accelerated and disappeared into it. After the sighting I then peered across to sky to see if I could see anything else, and caught some small activity around the moon, but I find it ordinary as I usually small orbs darting in and around the moon from time to time. The big mention is the large orb event that I described in the first two paragraphs.;51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698
Satellite-like object disapears and then possiblly flashes three times brightly.;2011-10-27 21:30:00;5 mins;Satellite-like object disapears and then possiblly flashes three times brightly. Was watching the night sky and spotted a satellite that was very slow moving compared to others I usually spot, tracked it with my eyes for a few minutes and then it seemed to dim and fade away.  I have never seen this but thought might be possible for a satellite to do that, sun light reflection angle and whatnot. Suddenly a few degree away from where the satellite-like object faded away there was a flash of light, as if there was a tower light or white airplane light way, way up there.  There were three or four flashes about a second apart.  I checked for movement by using some nearby stars but it seemed to be stationary.  I waiting for the satellite or flashing to come back, looking where it might reappear in the sky but nothing. Have never seen anything like this in years of stargazing and satellite watching.  The flashing seemed to be way up there but was bright and stared at the edged when it would reach the height of its brightness.

Satelitte-type ufo disappearing and reappearing;2012-08-08 22:59:00;1.5 minutes;satelitte-type ufo disappearing and reappearing I was sitting outside on my porch in the city looking up at the stars (clearish night but lots of light pollution only 3 or so stars visible in my area) when I saw a very bright satellite-like light moving across the sky. My first thought was that it was only a faster-than-regular-moving satellite when, all of a sudden, it disappeared. About 4 seconds later it re-appeared (following the same flight path) and began to fluctuate in brightness and intensity. I thought for a moment that I saw 2 smaller very dim lights on either side of the main light, but they quickly disappeared into the blind spot of my eyes. I opened the screen door and called out to my roommate to come quickly to where I was, and she rushed outside. I pointed it out, but again it had disappeared. As we stood there it reappeared again and continued to fluctuate in brightness and intensity. We watched it for about a minute, reappearing and disappearing about 3 times, sometimes looking almost ! like a very soft pinkish color, and then we lost it behind the roof of an adjacent house.;51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698

The craft was silent and moved at a constant pace at low altitude, i know this because it flew below the cloud cover. we were stunned for a moment absorbing this event and my friend pulled out his phone to catch the event on video. as he raised the camera and it was like who ever was piloting this craft was watching us because it dimmed to nothing and vanished before we could catch it on tape.;51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698

Four, large, pale green lights in a diamond formation, moving steadily, horizontally from W - E/SE before disappearing abruptly.;2014-08-22 23:31:00;6 seconds;Four, large, pale green lights in a diamond formation, moving steadily, horizontally from W - E/SE before disappearing abruptly. At approximately 23:31 on Friday, August 22, 2014, I was sky gazing from my balcony, four stories high.  I spotted four, large, round, pale green lights in a diamond or cross formation in the relative positions of 2, 5, 8 and 11 o'clock.  The lights were equally spaced from each other and were clearly visible over the downtown skyline of Calgary.  All four lights travelled together at the same rate of speed as if they were tethered by an invisible thread.  The speed was comparable to that of a slow moving traffic helicopter which I see daily. When I first saw the formation, it travelled horizontally from the west and steadily moved east - southeast, toward the main runway flight path (which runs in a North - South direction) of the Calgary Airport Authority. Upon entering this area of air space, the four lights very suddenly and without hesitation, shot upward at approximately a 45° angle to the left (which could have been eastward), then disappeared without a trace or remnant of light. The event lasted six seconds.  The sky was overcast with possibly some light rain throughout the city, however, no weather anomalies in my area that obstructed my view.;51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698

I watched it move to the handle end of the dipper having enough time to evaluate my conclusion of what it might be.  Then its was just gone.  Just vanished right by the big bright star after the last point of the Big Dipper's handle---No falling like a shooting star no trail of dust.  I wanted it to be a shooting star, to wish on.

Looked up at the night sky and saw two pinpoints of bright white light chasing each other very quickly through my line of vision.;2015-05-19 01:15:00;30 seconds;Looked up at the night sky and saw two pinpoints of bright white light chasing each other very quickly through my line of vision. I was outside having a cigarette last night with my boyfriend and I looked up towards the Western sky and saw what I thought was a shooting star.  I then realized that it was actually 2 points of white light that appeared to me about a centimeter apart (obviously they must have been much farther apart, but that is how it appeared to the naked eye). At first I thought it must be a plane or a satellite, but it seemed higher up than a plane would be traveling and lower than a satellite.  It was moving very quickly through my line of vision which also disproved my plane/satellite theory.  The pin point lights followed each other in the same formation through the sky from the north side of my vision until I couldn't see them anymore to the south (about 30 seconds).  It did not appear to be a plane of any sort because of its altitude and speed, and the lights appeared to be chasing each other towards the south in a parallel line.  This is the first time I have seen anything with my own eyes that I might possibly construe as a UFO. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Saw a green star-like object hovering, then it shot off several kilometers in 1-2 seconds at an incredible speed, hovered & disapeared.;2015-07-01 23:10:00;1-2 minutes;Saw a green star-like object hovering, then it shot off several kilometers in 1-2 seconds at an incredible speed, hovered & disapeared. My family and I went to see the July 1st fireworks (for Canada Day) in Calgary that were scheduled to be between 10:45pm and 11:45pm that day.  They were being launched off the Centre Street Bridge in Calgary, so we decided to go to the Sunnyside Bank Park and watch the fireworks from the top of the hill to get a good view (on Crescent Road NW near 2nd Street NW).  I remember looking at the time on my cell phone and at 10:51pm I made a comment to my wife that they were late with their fireworks. Within a few minutes of that time, the fireworks had started, and they lasted approximately 15 minutes.  Once the fireworks finished, I waited for maybe 30 seconds to see if any more were coming, but all there was now was smoke above the Centre Street Bridge.  I looked at my cell phone again and the time was 11:09pm.   I made another comment to my wife that they were liars, as I was expecting fireworks to last an hour.  She laughed, and shortly after that she asked me, What is that green light up there?  I looked up in the sky and saw a green stationery star-like object in the sky, hovering probably above Centre Street (not directly above us, just slightly east from us) and it was north of the Centre Street Bridge.  I don't know exactly how high it was, but it there was cloud cover and the object was still below the clouds.  At that moment when I first saw it, I didn't know what to think, as it was stationery.  In my mind I immediately related the light to some of the fireworks from before (although it was hovering and not rising and falling like a firework) or maybe a helicopter with a green light (I didn't hear any helicopter noise either, but the object was very high). The object hovered in that spot for several seconds (10 to 20 seconds), then suddenly it shot off in the south east direction at a speed that I had never witnessed any airplane do before.  It shot off several kilometers in the south east direction within 1 or 2 seconds, the came to a sudden  stop, and it hovered again for several seconds.  My heart immediately jumped at that moments, as I suddenly knew that whatever this was, it definitely was not a firework, a helicopter or any other conventional aircraft known to me. The light then suddenly vanished, as me and my wife started talking to each other in great excitement about what we just witnessed.  The light appeared again, I reached for my cell phone to start recording, but as soon as I had the phone ready, the light vanished again, and we did not see it after that. When my wife first noticed the object, it was hovering lower, then it shot up with incredible speed and became stationery, at which point she drew my attention to it.  I had missed the first part when it ascended, and I only saw it shoot horizontally across the sky.  It was Canada Day fireworks and there were thousands of people scattered all around to watch the fireworks. My wife, my 16 year old son and I all saw the object.  The people standing behind us saw the object.  Since there were thousands of people present, I'm sure that many others saw the object.  I hope that many more reports from that evening are filed, as I'm sure there are countless other witnesses to the event. It was just a light in the sky and if my wife had not pointed it out to me, I would have missed it.  Due to that fact, I'm sure that majority of the spectators did not see this light, but those that were looking up in the right direction would have seen it for sure.;51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698

Around ten thirty in the evening on October 7, 2015, there was a light blue light or orb that travelled quite quickly and quite low in a south east direction over Calgary.  There was significant cloud cover and no stars could be seen at all.  This object moved much faster and lower than a satellite normally would, it was fairly close to the ground.  It followed the generally route of aircraft leaving the Calgary airport but travelled considerably faster than an aircraft.

I may have missed the beginning of this parade but watched for 2-3 minutes as they just kept appearing and traveling across the sky in almost single file.
