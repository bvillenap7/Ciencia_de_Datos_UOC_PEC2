red and green circles in a V formation;1998-09-13 22:00:00;1 minute;red and green circles in a V formation Not to sure if this is the actual date.I was on my way to work and was waiting at my bus stop.While i was waiting I was looking up at the stars when I saw heading in a south to north direction 5 round shapes in the formation of a v. They were very dim and hard to see because of the city lights.They appeared to have a center that was red with a green ring on the outside.I never told anyone this before because I thought no one would believe me.The reason I am telling now is because I stumbelled on to this site and saw a similar story that took place in Calgary at about the same time my sighting did.I know it was in 98 because I was marryed that year in Sept.I work in a newspaper plant.My age is 33. I do not drink and don't do drugs. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698
Spherical White-Silver objects in formation seen over Western Calgary;2004-03-15 15:42:00;1-2 minutes;Spherical White-Silver objects in formation seen over Western Calgary I was walking home from the bus stop and glanced up at the sky only to notice a fleet of spherical white-silver metallic objects flying in a V- formation. As they traveled, they formed a straight line. Their flight trajectory was from the NNE to the SSW. This formation appeared to be flying at high altitude, but as it was a clear day, thus difficult to distinguish the relationship between size and altitude. (I estimate they were at above 9000m and appeared to be 2-3mm in diameter when seen from the ground). They made no contrails. They were visible until I got into my house, and when I went to find them a few seconds later in the sky again in the location I would presume they would be in (off to the SSW) they had disappeared.  I am a high school student with honours in all my courses, and have been an aviation enthusiast since I was 5. I know both civilian and military aircraft, and have never seen any craft perform or look like these. They were distinctly spherical and white-silver in colour, making no noise as they flew.

One light trailing another much slower than satellites at high altitide overhead.;2010-07-24 00:00:00;1-2 min.;One light trailing another much slower than satellites at high altitide overhead. Ok. I am a very good observer.  My mind isn't easily fooled.   Me and my equally conscious buddy saw an aerial phenom at about 0600 UT to 0700UT July 23 or 24 that was not easily explainable. We are in western canada on MT. So it was about 11 pm or 12 midnight local. My buddy alerted me to this and this what we saw.... 2 apparently stationary lights, one about 1.5 or 2 magnitudes brighter than the other that was in front of the less bright one and separated by maybe 1- 2 degrees.  I realized right away they weren't stars because the position near Lyra almost overhead, wasn't  correct. ..anyway, these apparently stationary two lights began to move together in formation...one trailing the other SW to NE and certainly too  slow to be satellites because a real N-S polar satellite passed by...SO the crazy thing is the brighter light in front of the trailing one faded to the same brightness as the other..then they both just faded away. I estimate we saw this for a good minute..maybe 2. It wasn't an Irridium Sat because they are in polar orbits only. I checked the ISS sightings for this area too and there weren't any scheduled for Friday or Saturday. I like to think we saw a real UFO ..or rather 2 !;51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698
Luminious bird like objects crossing the sky.;2016-04-10 23:20:00;5-6 seconds;Luminious bird like objects crossing the sky I was sitting in my hot tub and noticed a chevron/bird like illumanted object moving across the sky.  It was travelling at great speed and moved south to north in the clear evening sky with no sound.  There were three sighting in total. The first consisted of 5 bird like illumanions almost ghost like in a triangular form.  In the second viewing there were only 2 visible moving north to south across the stary sky.  Then finally two of these ghostly bird boomerang shapes crossed again and then faded off towards the east.   I was Not drinking and do not use drugs!;51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698
Craft moving in formation over SW Calgary, then performing aerial stunts;2017-06-16 10:28:00;6 minutes;crafts moving in formation over SW Calgary, then performing aerial stunts I was getting back into my car from grabbing a coffee at Tim Horton'sâ€¦  I was facing SW Calgary and noticed some aircraft off in the distance flying in formation.  The head formation broke off and headed in a NE direction, the crafts (5) then started to perform aerial stunts, dodging each other, moving erractically up and down.  The trailing crafts (3) continued northly for another 20 secs or so, and then headed in the same direction.   Grabbed my iphone to record event, which I thought I caught, but with the glaring sun on my screen, I never saw that the phone was not actually recording.   These craft appeared to be moving at a high rate of speed (similar to what I have seen at airshows) and probably were 10-15 km from my viewing point.  During one of its manuevers, it tilted up and it looked to be almost all wing no real tail or body...wing appeared whitish in the middle with dark grey on the ends.   I panic a bit at this point, thinking I had the event on video.  I got my car and drove off in the opposite direction.;51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698
Lights that seemed to be stars in a formation of a triangle dimming out slowly one after the other.;2019-09-02 20:00:00;15-20 seconds;Lights that seemed to be stars in a formation of a triangle dimming out slowly one after the other. i was taking the garbage out tonight and like i usually do after taking the garbage out to look up at the dusk sky to make a few prayers & to think to myself for about 10 min. i noticed what i thought to be stars as i was thinking/praying i noticed one of the lights to dim out slowly about 1/2 second then the next light dim out again within about 1/2 second then the third do the same, in a formation as what i could make out to be a triangle of three stars two at the top of formation and the one at the bottom making it out to be an upside down triangle from my point of view. after that happened i noticed what i could make out to be possibly a sattelite going quite fast in the direction where the dimming lights were, they looked relatively the same from eye vision but i know satelites travel some what fast & usually in a different direction from what i notice from looking up at the sky in our backyard.  I was amazed, and loved what i saw, still unsure what it could be.  My hopes are infact alien beings visiting us. &lt3;51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698
In Calgary's north east skys from midnight till About 5am anywhere between 3 and 6 craft can be seen,  undulating,  shaking Irracticly,;2020-03-15 01:00:00;4 hours;In Calgary's north east skys from midnight till About 5am anywhere between 3 and 6 craft can be seen,  undulating,  shaking Irracticly,  and usually in formation of a consolation or triangle to mask their presence,  green,  red,  white can clearly be seen.  Possibly cigar shape as well.  If they are who I was told they are,  I belive they are from Orion's belt.  Identical to us and positioned at that coordanate to monitor  earth progress,  as well...........  An alie,  protecting earth positioned there permanently to apprehend,  or intercept other races..........  interested  in earth.;51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698
