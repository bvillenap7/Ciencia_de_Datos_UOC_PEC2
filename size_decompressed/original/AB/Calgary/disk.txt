A big lightning strike occurred above the hill when a UFO appeared approximately three kilometres distant;1975-07-10 10:00:00;15 minutes;I was in the front picture window of my parents' house.  I was 18 years old.  It was raining with grey full cloud cover over the sky and lightning. My viewing was North towards the hill of Nose Hill Park watching the lighting. The airport is East of this location approximately 6 Kilometres. A big lighting strike occurred above the hill when a UFO appeared approximately three Kilometres.  It was huge, at least two commercial airliners put together.  Most of the UFO was Dark grey that tapered into a dome shaped top.  The dome had colours in it including red and green.  In the middle, you could see a band of fins which where rotating at high velocity.  It was hovering above this hill for about 15 minutes if not more.  It disappeared instantly in a flash of lightning. At that time in life, I was a conservative individual that had no awareness of the topic UFO’s.  I had not talked about it until later years in my life, when UFO’s where in the news. By the way I would like to note that the date of the sighting may be wrong.  It was in June or July and in 1975 or 1976. Sincerely,  ((name deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date above is approximate.  PD));51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698

At around 2300 hours I was working with my partner patroling the south west part of the city of Calgary. A call came in on the north west side of the city, which was in a separate district of the city in which we where working, however we shared the same radio channel. The call was that there was several unidentified object flying over the north west part of the city, at this time only a couple of calls had come in and my partner and I thought nothing of it at the time and the comments on the radio of the north west units on patrol, more orless joked about the call. But with in the next hour our communications section began to get a flood of calls coming into our main dispatch section of the same type of call, several unidentified craft in the northwest part of the sky, just sitting there. At this time my partnerand I decided to check it out by driving to an open field on the south west part of the city which was elevated and had a good view of the city from the west. A north west car was dispatched to the call. Shortly upon our arrivial to our view piont, I along with my partner could see one object directly north of our position, placing it in the far west of the city's north end approx 3 miles north of us. A second object could be seen east of the first above the north centre of the city, this object was the same design of the first over the north west of the city. Both of these objects where hovering over the city, i would estamate at leat 1,500 feet above the ground and from our vantage piont we could see a bright white light in the centre of the craft and a blue light on top rotating in one direction as though it was mounted on the out side of a saucer and the saucer was spinning, there was a red light on the bottom this was a red light and moved in the opposite direction of the blue light that was mounted on the top. The blue light was mounted in the same way as the red light, as though it was on the end of a sauce. Looking further east and north of the city another object could be similar, however this object was estamated to be at least 5 to 7 miles away. When we looked south of our location we could see another object identical to the first three objects and this one was directly in line with the north west object if your drew a line directly south of the north west object. The object was was approx 3 miles south of our location and appeared to be higher above the ground, i would est. to be 3,000 feet above the ground. There was a second object in the south west of the city which appeared to be inline with the second north object that was over the north centre of the city. All the object where of the same configuration. Shortly after our arrivial, the unit in the north stated over the radio channel that a citizen had lent him a pair of binnocular's, and he stated that the craft was saucer shaped with blue light on the top and a red light on the bottom. The north west unit then turned on his over head emergencie equipment (patrolcar lights - red/blue). It was at this moment that we saw the object in the north west bounce up and down several time, faster than any craft that I have ever seen, dropping altatude aprrox 500 ft in seconds and bouncing back to its originial position. Our communications section contacted the military base which wasin the city at the time, and two MP's in a vehicle attended our location. The airport was contacted by our communications personel and we where informed that the air port could not see any thing and had nothing on radar. The airport is located in the north east corner of the city and had a view of the entire city from the north east. Upon arrivial of the MP (military police) the witnesses the same objects. With in a short time the MP recieved a dispatch call from thier dispatcher saying that Spokan Washington had just been in touch with Ottawa and they said that they knew what the objects where and not to worry about them. After an hour at the site, the object in the south west part of the city began to move west bount, slowly at first then turned faster in a split second to a blurr as thoughit was traveling at warp speed and then it vanished. The next day the story was debunked in the local news papers, saying that the objects where stars in the sky and not ufo's. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We have assigned an arbitrary date so that the report sorts to June 1984.  PD));51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698

I went outside to inspect it further and the light dimmed gradually.  Two small red and green lights were visible on either side of this disc when the bright light dimmed.  The disc slowly moved across the sky in a straight line, making no noise . It was absolutely a UFO of some kind.  It then disappeared.;51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698
