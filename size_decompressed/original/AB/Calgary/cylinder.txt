HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Object caused a power outage?;2001-02-14 22:00:00;approx: two hours;Object caused a power outage ? Date: February 2001 Time: evening  I received a telephone call from a woman who resides in Calgary, Alberta. The family has a very good view of the city of Calgary. One evening the family watched a craft over top of Calgary back in 2001. They reported observing an object for approximately two hours. The lady told me the family got a new telescope for Christmas and this evening in February was the first time they really tried it out. It was cold outside so they set the telescope up indoors and viewed the skies from the comfort of their home looking through one of their large living room windows. The lights were turned off as they did not want to have their view obscured.  The family noticed a bright object high in the sky and first thought it may have been the planet Venus. So they turned the telescope slightly to have a peek at it. (At this point I should tell you that the weather conditions were good and the skies clear and the temperature down to about minus 29).  As they lined up the telescope using the view finder and then looked through the scope they were surprised to see an object which was shrouded in clouds. There were no other clouds visible in the sky that they noticed. The object that was witnessed had an elliptical shape to it. One end of it was poking out of the cloud cover and they were surprised to see windows on the craft. She said she could clearly see through the telescope that the object had windows which ran down along its side.  The lady said it looked as if whatever this was, was trying to impersonate a star. The object would move around the sky very slowly and if anyone on the ground would have seen it, they may have just thought it to be a star or planet. She said it was very high up in altitude. After taking roughly a five minute break from looking through their telescope she came back and now viewed two bright objects. One was stationary over top of the other and offset by half the length of one of the crafts. Both objects still wrapped in a cloud cover and she saw a long tube which was connecting the two objects at roughly a forty five degree angle. The woman said it was a beautiful, cylindrical shaped tube wrapped in cloud. Also it was reported that the cloud cover stuck very close to the shape of the objects and not spread out across the sky.  It was the bottom object, or the end which was sticking out of the cloud cover that she could see had windows, which were the same shape of the objects or roundish. When the objects moved directly overhead of Calgary all of the electricity went out. When the objects moved to the outskirts of the city the power came back on and eventually the crafts moved out of sight. The lady said it was a very exciting night and one they would never forget. Thank you to the witness for the report.  Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Phone 1 250 845 2189 email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

On Saturday afternoon, Sept. 2, when approaching my house in SW Calgary AB, Canada, I spotted an object flying west accross the sky. Wh;2006-09-02 16:30:00;30 seconds;On Saturday afternoon, Sept. 2, when approaching my house in SW Calgary AB, Canada, I spotted an object flying west accross the sky.  When I spotted it I stopped my car and watched it for a maybe 20 seconds, until it began to move upwards and behind a tree from my view.   I moved my car to see it better, and when I stopped again to see where it had gone, it was gone. I was blown away, I have seen a few air shows and it was slearly not a helicopter or airplane, it was:  - ju-jube shaped and metallic - slow and smooth moving like you see in crazy UFO vidoes - reflected the sun's light in an almost mirror-like way - again, blew me away, nothing i've ever seen before   Thanks for hearing me out, I hope someone else saw it too.

Large, bright, green, fast moving object falling from the sky and suddenly vanishing before crashing.;2011-12-22 05:00:00;3-5 seconds;Large, bright, green, fast moving object falling from the sky and suddenly vanishing before crashing. We were driving near the airport in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. On Airport Trail NE.  Direction east.  It was about 5:00 am.  Directly in front of us, but some distance ahead, and appearing suddenly, was a single large, bright, green object.  It was cylindrical in shape.  It was travelling straight downward and moving very quickly. It was travelling so rapidly that it appeared as though it was going to crash into the ground.  Instead, it suddenly vanished. The background was farmland. Myself (42, F) and my 13 year old son witnessed it.;51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698
Well-lighted cylindrical object in Calgary sky moving NW to SE. Odd shape, size, and angle (orientation).;2021-03-04 06:07:00;2-3 minutes;Well-lighted cylindrical object in Calgary sky moving NW to SE. Odd shape, size, and angle (orientation). March 4, 2021 @ 06:05 Calgary, Alberta, Canada  Standing at a bus stop near my residence, which is inner city, I looked up at the morning sky and the moon, then noticed a cylindrical set of lights moving NW to SE. The sky was clear on this morning, as far as I could tell, being able to easily see the moon and stars.  At first I suspected the collection of lights to be a plane. It seemed to be moving oddly though, as I thought to myself it seems like it's coming down and even worried for a second that it was on a trajectory with my neighbourhood. In the next moment, I was puzzled at the shape of the object, the angle of it (orientation), and also the luminosity of it, seemingly surrounded with lights.  It was then that I first considered I should take some pictures/video, and got my phone out. I am not the fastest draw in the west at taking pictures with my phone, and this was very early in the AM as I waited for my bus to go to work. But I collected 4-5 decent pics and one 40 sec video, plus another very short clip. The object continued on its course SE. It became dimmer as it moved away, and then my bus showed up.  The object moved at about the speed of a plane, I would say, certainly not too fast, but a steady pace. The video I shot is shaky because of my trying to line it up and even zoom in it is not the object dancing around. The object stayed on a fairly even course throughout.  I listened for the sound of a plane, and could not be sure I heard it. Living in the city, there is a lot of ambient noise that sounds like a constant hum, especially early in the morning when there are not much car noises on the street. There was just no really obvious jet sounds.;51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698
