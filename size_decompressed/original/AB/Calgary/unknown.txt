It was hard to determine the shape of the object as all we could see were uneven lighting around the edges of it.  It flew east and then south.  We followed it and it started to hover.  It was quite high in the sky.  It appeared that it turned over on its side and we saw four small lights in the shape of a square with a faint circle joining all the lights.  While in the sky a plane came from the north and circled the object.  It then flew back north from where it came.  All of the sudden the object was gone.;51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698
BRIGHT LIGHT TRACKS FROM WEST TO EAST IN SOLID OVERCAST;2000-06-25 00:45:00;45 sec;BRIGHT LIGHT TRACKS FROM WEST TO EAST IN SOLID OVERCAST AT 12:45 AM A LIGHT DECSENDED INSIDE SOLID OVERCAST, THE LIGHT WAS SO BRIGHT IT LIT UP THE CLOUD.  THE OVERCAST WAS ABOUT 6000 FEET. IT REMAINED STATIONARY IN THE CLOUD FOR 2 TO 3 SECONDS AND THEN PROCEDED TO TRAVEL FROM THE DIRECTION OF WEST TO EAST. IT DID NOT COME OUT OF THE CLOUD,AND STAYED ON AN EASTERN TRACK UNTIL I LOST SIGHT OF IT. ALSO THERE WAS NO SOUND EMITTED FROM THE CRAFT. I CALLED AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL AND THEY INFORMED ME THAT THERE WAS NO SCHEDULED TRAFFIC IN THE AREA AT THAT TIME.;51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698

i was comming home from work and i was walking my usual route home at around 1 am.;2003-04-18 01:00:00;2 minutes;i was comming home from work and i was walking my usual route home at around 1 am. As i came out of an alley to transfer to another one something ran across the street bewteen two cars. At first i thought it was just a rabbit as there are rabbits in the area. I looked over and noticed it was about 4 feet high and running on two legs.  I stopped, i was in complete awe, it ran in bewteen 2 cars and then i lost track of it as i was in a complete state of shock.  At first i thought i was just seeing things so i moved on for a bit only to stop and then make way to where i had seen the alien. as i got closer to where i saw it i got increbily frighten and had a weird feeling that i was being watched.  I began to panic so i tried to calm myself down and kept looking around.  After finding it was gone i went home.  The alien had a kinda brownish green legs, as it ran it seemed to be ducking or hunching over like it was trying not to be seen. i walked home and every few mins i would look over my back.;51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698
Had a multycoloured pulsing strobe-light  sort of like a disco light.;2004-02-12 02:30:00;5:00-7:00min.;Had a multycoloured pulsing strobe-light  sort of like a disco light. Was up late online,opened my window facing west and noticed a strange very high pitched sound I looked up and saw what appeared to be a helecopter I say helecopter because it had aflashing red tail light and it was circling my house.I thought it must have been a new police chopper like the one we already had in calgary.Except for one big differance,there was no rotor/motor sound whatsoever.I mean it was silent as a balloon.It circled about 150 meters over my roof in about ahalf kilometer radius around the neighbourhood.It circled counterclockwise 3 times going over the roof out of sight each time.I also could not see any of the fusalage except for a faint half-circle that I guess was the front.Then suddenly,just before it disappeared over the roof for the third time a rectangular pulsing-strobe light fired up under the half-circle and it was also multi-coloured.the hair on my neck stood up and I ran to get my binocs I had no film for my camera disapointingly.It circled two more times over the house but did not fire its strange light.Another very wierd thing,when Ilooked at it through the binocs I could not make out any details of the fusalage,A jet or airplane at night will light itself up with its own lights.The lone red light in the rear of this thing did not seem too have any fusalage around it to alluminate.  calgary business owner.;51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698
2 bright lights moving fast and erratically;2005-08-05 23:00:00;5 seconds;2 bright lights moving fast and erratically Date – Aug 5, 2005 at about 11 PM  Location – viewed from our deck in the western sky  Appearance – 2 very bright lights  Description – The lights were traveling quite fast (  appeared to move about 5 times faster then an airplane at the apparent distance ) in a westerly direction. They changed directions several times in a bit of spiral action (sometimes close together and then moving apart). They disappeared after about 5 seconds, sort of into the clouds. There was no sound;51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698
Intensely bright white stationary light in the night sky.;2008-07-12 23:35:00;5 to 10 seconds;Intensely bright white stationary light in the night sky. While driving a local train here in Calgary at around 23:35, on Saturday, July 12th, 2008, and while we were headed in a northwest direction something strange occurred.  Prior to (about 30 seconds away) from arriving at one of our NW stations, I looked into the fairly clear night sky through the windshield of the train that I was driving. There was a thin layer of cirrostratus clouds in some areas of the dark sky. Well, I noticed a bright stationary white light (star or distant planet type light, but more intensely bright) in the sky, about 60 degrees from the horizontal, ahead of me. I thought, that sure is one bright planet, but in that area of the sky over this city, puzzled me. All of a sudden, the extremely bright white light, which was shining through a bit of a haze (possibly from the high clouds), got even brighter before lowering in intensity and disappearing totally. The duration of this whole episode only took about 5 to 10 seconds.  On my next trip through the same rail line, about 2 hours later, I looked in the same vicinity of the sky, to see if I could see the bright light that I saw prior, but I did not see it again.  I found it quite stunning, as the light was very bright and very noticeable in the dark sky. The light did not move from the location. Was this a possible UFO sighting?;51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698
UFO follows jet while jet lands;2017-01-13 01:25:00;5;UFO follows jet while jet lands I live near the airport here, and can see all the landings on runway 00, about 2 miles away.  I watched a passenger jet landing on runway 00 while having a smoke past midnight.  I noticed a dim single light behind the aircraft following it in.  It could move much faster than the jet, and I estimate it could move up and down, back and forth about 200ft/sec. or more.  It would move up for a few seconds above the jet, then down for a few seconds below the jet, seemingly inspecting the jet. When the jet was about 2 miles from touch down, the UFO disappeared totally.  I did not see it leave, just the dim light disappeared all of a sudden. I contacted the airport to see if they got any radar hits on it, waiting for a reply.;51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698
Buzzing UFO, not seen but heard.;2018-01-21 21:00:00;1 minute;Buzzing UFO, not seen but heard. I was out on my patio and heard a buzzing sound or pulsing sound and wondered where it was coming from in the building (3 story condo 130 units). The sound got louder (coming toward me I guess) until the craft passed over or near the building. At first I thought it was a sound coming from the building and wondered what it was. But I soon realized it was not a building sound but something flying over head. When it passed over I heard a woosh sound. I heard no conventional engine sounds at all just the buzzing or pulsing sound. There were no lights that I could see on the craft. Very very odd to be sure.;51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698
Drone like UFO (No lights);2019-01-08 02:49:00;2 minutes;Drone like UFO (No lights) I was walking my dog just before 3am this morning in Prestwick (McKenzie Towne) when I heard this buzzing humming sound.  Similar to a helicopter, but more like a drone, only bigger.  It had no lights either.  I heard it approaching and it was more like a drone at this point with higher pitched humming like a drone.  I was convinced it was a heli until it approached where I was walking, and I saw the shape, only a couple hundred feet above me, and it did a 3/4 circle around my head, then took off toward Deerfoot.  Almost in the same direction it came.  It was fast.  Probably the size of a smart car, and again...no lights what so ever.;51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698
Very very slow and very high bright light moving during the daytime overhead on Nosehill;2019-07-26 17:30:00;5-10 minutes;Very very slow and very high bright light moving during the daytime overhead on Nosehill Walking on Nosehill pathways near Berkeley Gate.  Very very high in the sky there was a tiny but bright light.  It resembled Venus on a dark night but in the bright blue daytime sky.  It moved very, very slowly overhead and continued on a slow straight path.  Too high and slow to just be a plane reflecting light.  The brightness never changed.  Too fast to be a bright planet somehow visible.  Very curious.  Even too slow to be a satellite.  No noise;51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698
16 consecutive lights equidistant from each other.  ((Spacelink satellites??));2020-02-25 06:10:00;90 seconds;16 consecutive lights equidistant from each other. On Tuesday February 25, 2020, at precisely 6:10 AM MST, I was leaving my residence and decided to look directly upwards into the night sky to observe the stars.  It was a compulsion I had that I normally do not perform.  At this time, the sky was clear and still dark.  There was no moon present, at least not in my visual field of view. I noticed a moving object high in the sky – at what I would estimate to be in the high upper atmosphere or beyond – I would say a lower satellite.  And that is what I thought, it was a satellite traversing from west to east (measured from 260° W going towards 80°E).  The observation was made close to 50.923767, -114.122889 – Calgary, Alberta, Canada.  I was looking directly up and possibly 2° from the vertical and facing North – I want to stress,  I was looking nearly upwards.  My view to the north was blocked by my house and my back was to the south – this is important later. At first I thought it was a satellite.  Having observed satellites for many years (being in my 50’s), I know what one looks like as they traverse the sky – and this one looked no different than them.  There were no flashing lights, it remained white without changing color and remained the same magnitude of brightness. What caught my eye was it was being followed by another moving light, at the same pace.  Not being able to judge height, and therefore distance, all I could do was record the time gap – approximately 5 seconds.  Stranger now, was a third, then a fourth.  I had counted 16 consecutive lights.  All matched the same speed and course.  NO DEVIATIONS.  There is no telling how many lights previous to my looking up had passed.  Also being late for work, there is no telling how many more were still in the cue.  These were not planes flying formation as this was a long linear line and no contrails. The lights covered an arc angle of approximately 30 degrees in the 5 seconds. This was absolutely not a series of meteors.  Too slow and no trails as well as brightness never wavered.  I have observed many meteors, both high atmosphere burn outs and low atmosphere brilliant burn outs.  This was none of them. I am a professional engineer of 30 years who prides myself in being open but logical.  I thought that these could be satellites, so I checked the satellite map when I got to work.  Enclosed is a snapshot of the map (available on request).  My interpretation of the map shows NO satellites (at least 16 equi-distanced) directly above me from west to east.  The map was set to the time of my observation. I attempted to take a video, but it was too dark and the phone was not able to record the lights.;51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698
