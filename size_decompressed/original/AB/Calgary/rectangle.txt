While working in the N.W myself and my work colleague noticed a rectangular object falling from the sky.  It was spinning and tumbling as it fell.  The object was reflective and appeared to be quite large because we could see it until it disappeared along the horizon.   It was moving in a southern direction faster than it fell towards the ground.;51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698
