Orange (and blue tinged) objects observed over south west Calgary.;2014-01-25 22:45:00;5 minutes;Orange (and blue tinged ) objects observed over south west Calgary. We observed 5 orange objects ( with a tinge of blue) in a distinct L formation move slowly north in unison.  No noise detected.  The formation then turned southeast, rose slowly into the air and disappeared.  There was some separation of the objects at a higher altitude.   Two more objects like these then followed and they too turned east then south and disappeared.  No detectable ground winds.  We were able to catch a photo on our cell phone.

Cloud oddly changed formation, split in two and formed a light streak on a sunny, clear morning.;2015-11-28 10:00:00;3 minutes;Cloud oddly changed formation, split in two and formed a light streak on a sunny, clear morning. Beautiful, clear, sunny morning sky....Looked outside kitchen window and thought it was strange to see in what appeared to be a very small cloud in the sky.  No other clouds could be seen.   Watched the shape change from circular to oval to oblong when the cloud broke into two in a matter of seconds!  The lower cloud appeared to light up like eletricity was running through it (similar to when you see lightning in the daytime).   The light then slowly left a trail heading downwards then hooked upwards leaving a impression of what looked like a fishing hook!  Then it slowly faded away!  Was not a vap trail as a few where visible at time of sighting! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698

Blue/White flat oval thing in sky at dusk.  ((anonymous report));2017-09-02 21:30:00;5 seconds;Blue/White flat oval thing in sky at dusk. Oval I think. Blimp shape. No fins. Seemed to get flatter then longer. Then disappeared in a blink of my eye. I had a feeling it knew I saw it.  Kinda like it was hiding. Didn't look like a falling star.  It didn't really move.  It was there, then it wasn't. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698
