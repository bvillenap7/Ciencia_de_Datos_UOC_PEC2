It was morning and I had gotten up to go to the bathroom, I always look out the back window as this is my habit of doing. as I came back from the bathroom, I took a second glance and thought that it was a airplane with bright lights on, when it was flying side ways I knew it wasn't of that sort. I opened my back door to get a better glimpse so as not to make a mistake about what I saw. There was no sound. I watched as it stopped and then move again. if only I could of gotten closer wow. I'm sorry as I don't have a picture to show you only what I've experienced. but this is how they flew information o    o o this is the best I can do for you.;51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698
Two cloud-shrouded craft, joined by a cylinder, traversed the night sky a power outage occurred as they passed overhead.;2001-02-10 18:30:00;1 1/2 hours;Two cloud-shrouded craft, joined by a cylinder, traversed the night sky a power outage occurred as they passed overhead. To the naked eye what appeared looked like the planet Venus. Through a telescope, two craft were seen, both shrouded in clouds - the only cloud in the entire sky. The objects were maintaining positions parallel to one another, but offset by about half their length. Joining the two appeared to be a tube-like construction, also wrapped in cloud, but not to the extent that the cylindrical shape wasn't obvious. Windows were clearly apparent at the end of one craft, which was poking out from behind it's cloud cover. The joined pair traversed the night sky in about one and a half hours, and when directly overhead, North Calgary lost its electricity. On a cloudless night, the small wisp of cloud covering the craft remained in position at all times.;51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698
I have no summary;2004-04-18 12:00:00;10 seconds;I have no summary I was watching planes land at the airport. I am a pilot myself and do this often. My best friend was due to arrive on an A-320. The plane that preceded him was a Cessna Citation II. To get to the point! I saw a small disk shapped thing? behind the Citation. I always take my camera and a scanner with me to the airport. I have a perfect picture of this event. If you are a pilot you never!!!! tell people what you have seen. It might get you fired!         Any interest in the picture?

3-lighted, catepiller-like object over Calgary.;2005-08-01 01:00:00;2 mins;3-lighted, catepiller-like object over Calgary At approximately 1am on August 1, 2005 a 3-lighted object slithered across the Calgary skyline, from west to east (I live on the west side).  As it approached the downtown city lights it vanished and simultaneously a meteor appeared, following the same trajectory as the object had.  I have one witness with me who saw me pointing to this object, but he couldn’t see it himself. He instead followed my eyes as I was following the object and he saw the subsequent meteor. I said to him as I watched this object look at that, there are no lights, yes, there are three lights. I said “no lights” first because there were no red or white blinking lights that you would see normally see on a plane. I knew there were no wings in other words. I don't understand how he could not have seen the object, it was large enough, close enough and there were no other objects visible in the cloudless, starry sky. He was absolutely convinced I was seeing and watching and following this object with my eyes, and the meteor happening at the same time I said to him it's vanished was quite a coincidence. No alcohol or other substances involved.  The object was about the size of a large airplane and was caterpillar or ameba-like with three dome type lights beneath it that did not radiate any sort of light downward. The lights took up at least 80% of the underside of the object. There were no other lights on the side or top or around it at all.  It made no sound at all, yet was flying low enough (maybe 10,000 ft) that if it were a regular airplane, you would have heard sound. It was too late for a normal airplane to fly over my house. It moved very smoothly across the night skyline. It appeared completely in synch with the sky, as if it was traveling on water. When I say caterpillar-like it was because of the fluidity of its movement – like it wasn’t a completely solid structure, it seemed to move and bend in a way a plane never would.  My sense was that it was scanning.;51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698

We were coming down the road and i saw a white oval shaped object hovering and spinning.  It was just under 100 meters away.  From that distance it looked to be a bit larger than a adult man.;51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698
huge shiny oval shaped object seen in calgary;2010-11-07 15:00:00;2 minutes;huge shiny oval shaped object seen in calgary i was leaving work and noticed a shiny oval shaped object in the sky.  it was extremely large. i believe this because it was in the distance from a small plane stream left above me. i could see the small plane getting smaller as it got further away flying east, the object was flying south and appeared to be the same distance as the plane. it was huge . it  was oval shaped and shiny like a reflecting mirror. it was moving slowly and then  it shot away in a straight line. 10 seconds later it shot up behind  a cloud and then it was gone. it was nothing like i have ever seen. it was enormous.;51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698

The object was neon green in color, very bright.  It was shaped like a flat circle.   It came down into our view through the 3rd floor window, zigzagged back and forth a number of times, then went down where we couldn't see it, and it then came back up and disappeared.  It traveled very fast.    We were facing south and we live in the southwest.;51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698
White semi-transparent oval-ish object moving at high speed directly opposite direction of airliner.;2014-05-16 17:15:00;~10 seconds;White semi-transparent oval-ish object moving at high speed directly opposite direction of airliner. Friday, May 16, 2014   I was outside in my backyard in Calgary, Alberta, about 5:15pm and noticed that airliners coming out of YYC airport appeared to reaching higher altitudes faster than what we normally see in take off patterns. I watched one airliner as it banked from its southward climb out to a westward direction. Approximately one minute later, I noticed another airliner which remained climbing out in a southward direction and appeared to be at a surprisingly high altitude for just coming out of our airport. As I watched that airliner move past the directly vertical position my eye caught an object moving in exactly the opposite direction, south to north, at what appeared to be a high altitude at a speed at least equal to the airliner.  The object was white in colour, with a bit of an oval shape about it and with a degree of transparency towards the middle.  It appeared smaller than the airliner and I at first thought that it must be a bird but there were no wings and none of the typical motion of a bird.   The flight path was very straight. It was in my field of view for approximately 10 seconds and having ruled out it being a bird I wondered if it might perhaps be a balloon being pushed along by a high altitude wind even though there was no wind at ground level and when I have seen weather balloons or kids balloons in the past they have all displayed some degree of buffeting motion being pushed along by wind.  In this case the object had a solid trajectory as it travelled along.  No sound from object.;51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698
Large, fixed object to the west.;2020-04-15 23:00:00;15 minutes;Large, fixed object to the west. We were getting ready for bed, and noticed at least one helicopter flying around our neighborhood.  It was joined by an aircraft.  My wife looked out the window, and noticed a large object to the west.  It did not move for at least 10 minutes.  I ran downstairs to get my DSLR, but could not manually focus on the object, it was hazy, but it appeared to be white, with red and green pulses.  Once the plane moved towards it, it blinked a couple of times and disappeared.  Shortly after that the aircraft left the area.;51.0349887480189;-114.073320760698
