Bright pulsating light, moving quickly and erratically.;2003-05-21 02:00:00;10-15 seconds;Bright pulsating light, moving quickly and erratically. I was returning home from Edmonton. I live on an acreage near Stony Plain. A friend and I had spent the day fishing and finished off with some food. I got back to my house around 1:30-2:00 AM.  Upon getting out of my car I looked at the sky, as I usually do on a clear night. I was admiring how clear the sky was when I noticed a very bright light to the north. My first instinct was that it may be a satellite. I love watching the sky and am quite familiar with the appearance of satellites in orbit, and their linear patterns. This light however was not moving in a straight line and seemed to slow down and speed up randomly. It would pulsate from very bright to almost invisible. The duration of the brightness was much longer than the gradual fade.  It appeared circular in shape, but had no visible edges. It proceeded south in a straight line, occasionally breaking course to either side. The movement did not seem natural.  It was also quite close, compared to satellites I have seen in the night sky. No sound was emitted. The whole thing was actually quite surreal, especially since it had covered so much distance in 10-15 seconds. Shortly after it had broke from its straight course south for the 5th or 6th time, it just seemed to vanish.  I'm not sure what I saw. I do watch the sky constantly, for beauty and curiosity. This event stood out from anything else I have ever seen. Got me pretty excited, and a little nervous.;53.5326;-113.9955
