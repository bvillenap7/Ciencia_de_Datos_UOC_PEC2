I noticed a bright light moving oddly.  I thought it was a plane or something until it seemed to be getting closer, moving lower in the sky and getting brighter.  I then noticed it was hovering over my neighbors acreage down the road from me. It appeared to be hovering over the house and the light was very bright. I remember getting out of bed to get a closer look. Almost not believing what I had seen. I recall thinking to myself, I am not supposed to be seeing this, before I felt like something had noticed me, the light got brighter and next thing I knew I was waking up in bed.  The experience does not leave me overly frightened. It happened a long time ago, and I never reported it bevause I thought it was a dream but I recently had another dream about UFOs over Edmonton and I haven't had a dream in nearly 8 months. So I came to see reports and noticed that the reports in 2019 have significantly increased, so figured I would make a report and see if anyone else had this experience.;53.368;-112.6606
