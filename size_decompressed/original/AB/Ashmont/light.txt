Red flashing light heads towards the ground;2016-04-22 23:15:00;1 hour;Red flashing light heads towards the ground Sounded like a aircraft going past my house at about 11:15, heard it even with headphones in.  Then I saw red flashing light going past the window, and moving fast. It was much to low to be any type of plane and there was no green light.  It was heading down towards the ground very fast. Went outside to watch, It looked as if it landed or got close to the ground in a nearby field and continued west.  I watched it flash until I lost sight through the tree line.  When I went back out to check I saw it again further north in the trees, still on ground level and flashing. I have seen many weird lights in the sky out here, but never anything come out of the sky.;54.1336;-111.5701
