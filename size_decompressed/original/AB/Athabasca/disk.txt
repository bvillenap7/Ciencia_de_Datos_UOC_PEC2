It was a very bright crome color and was quite large. We arived home and noticed it was still in the sky in the same place. After an hour or so the kids said it was still out there so i took out our vidio camera and started taking pictures of it...we called the local tv station and they were here the next day to see the vidio.....it was used on the news and there was no explanation givin for it. We watched the ufo for about 3 hours and vidio taped it for a while ...it was seemed very large and was a very bright crome color almost like the sun shining on crome except the sun was behind it. It didnt seem to move at all for the longest time... then just before it took off it split into three (which we have on vidio) and took off out of sight in a mater of a few seconds. Email me for anything else u might want to know...thanksâ€¦((name deleted));54.7233;-113.2858
Saucer shape with 4 windows, not clear about the color;2017-04-29 23:00:00;<5 seconds;Saucer shape with 4 windows, not clear about the color It was night, but my wife saw the UFO.  It was very close to and above us because she saw the 4 windows and structure of the UFO.  According to her description, it was hanging over and left after she saw it.  The evening was dark, so it was not very easy to see it in the sky. Even I did not see, but from her face and eyes, I know she really saw something.;54.7233;-113.2858
