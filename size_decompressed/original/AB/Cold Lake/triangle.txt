They had blinking lights and a blue halo, darker than the sky. They hovered for a moment, and there was a flash of white light, and they were gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  May be hoaxed report.  Date is flawed.  We wonder whether the witness intended to indicate a date in 1999, but we have no way of knowing, and we cannot contact the individual who submitted the report.  We have changed the date above to reflect a date in 1999, but that change is purely arbitrary, on our part, and based on our assumption concerning the date.  PD));54.4502;-110.2017
