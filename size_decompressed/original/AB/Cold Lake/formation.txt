v formation of lights in outer space turning 90 degrees;1979-05-20 01:00:00;45 seconds;v formation of lights in outer space turning 90 degrees I was stationed at Cold Lake Alberta air force base and was partying with numerous people at a large lake late at night. The sky was crystal clear and there were billions of stars.  I was star gazing and noticed a v formation of 5 lights in outer space. They were moving very fast across the heavens and they suddenly stopped on a dime, turned 90 degrees (while still in formation), and accelerated at high speed until they were out of our sight.   I pointed it out to approx. 18 people that were with me and they were all amazed. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));54.4502;-110.2017
