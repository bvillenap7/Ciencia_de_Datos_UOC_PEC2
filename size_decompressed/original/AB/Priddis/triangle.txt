2 triangle Shaped Objects in Priddis Night Sky.;2014-08-12 23:30:00;1.5 hours;2 triangle Shaped Objects in Priddis Night Sky. The object is triangular in shape with a light on each angle.  It started to move vertical from horizon to hundreds of feet in seconds,  then it flew to the left towards the 2nd object that seems to just avoid the 2nd object.   The 2nd object stayed to its location throughout the period while the 1st object flew very fast from about 45 deg to 90 degrees in seconds and stayed there until me and my friends left.   There were airplane in the sky so we know that they are not airplane and they move very fast vertically, and can hover on one location.;50.88;-114.3336
