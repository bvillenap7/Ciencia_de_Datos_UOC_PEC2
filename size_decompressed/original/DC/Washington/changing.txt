Strange, yellowish light spinning behind President Bush's head during 6/6/02 speech;2002-06-06 19:00:00;20 minutes;Strange, yellowish light spinning behind President Bush's head during 6/6/02 speech I just finished watching President Bush's latest homeland security speech (6/6/02) that was simultaneously broadcast on every major news channel in existence and saw a very odd light hovering outside the window behind his head for the length of the presentation. It was yellowish in color and looked to be quite large. It seemed to be spinning and changing form while travelling from left to right without pattern. At times it was obscured by Bush's head, only to return a few seconds later. It definitely did not look like an airplane. I urge anyone who has access to a video of this speech to take a look and decide for yourself. ((NUFORC Note:  We received several reports about the unidentified lights seen during the President's speech.  We see nothing about the lights that would cause a reasonable person to conclude that they were genuine UFO's.  We suspect either reflection off the inside of the window behind the President, or landing lights on aircraft landing at Ronald Reagan Airport.  PD));38.9066060549607;-77.0252989753134
Red Object Hovering in Sky Over Washington, DC on July 31, 2002;2002-07-31 16:45:00;5 -6 seconds;Red Object Hovering in Sky Over Washington, DC on July 31, 2002 At approximately 4:45 -5:00 pm on Wednesday, July 31, 2002, I was walking across the bridge to Roosevelt Island when I saw a red object hovering in the sky.  The object appeared to be stationary or moving very slowly around the 1-2,000 foot range.  The object was located at 2:00 o'clock in the sky from my path across the bridge onto the island.  I blinked and blinked and blinked again, and the object was visible to me for approximately 5-6 seconds.  The object was initally solid and blocky in appearance but in the final seconds, it seemed to turn on end and then the object reflected the sunlight like a shield. The object then seemed to change shape as it shimmered like a flag in the breeze and disappeared from view.;38.9066060549607;-77.0252989753134
3 objects in 15 minutes, 2 balls of light moving north to south and 1 shape changing white &quotball&quot moving in same direction;2012-07-25 21:30:00;10-15 minutes;3 objects in 15 minutes, 2 balls of light moving north to south and 1 shape changing white &quotball&quot moving in same direction On Wednesday 7/25/12 I was walking home from a friend’s house at about 9:30pm.  I was passing a school located at Rhode Island Ave. & Q St. NW.  Coming from behind the school, I saw a bright light high up in the sky moving south to north.  At first it looked like an airplane because it was moving in a slow, slight line.  But the more I looked at it the less it looked like an airplane.  The light had an orange color to it and was getting brighter and then dimmer over and over again.  As it passed overhead, it started to dim and then finally disappeared altogether. Right before the light disappeared, another light came from behind the same school.  This second light was completely identical to the first in its flight path, speed and quality of the color.  It also dimmed and then disappeared at the same place in the sky as the first one did.  It’s difficult to estimate how far each one traveled as I watched them.  But they were far up in the sky so they easily could have covered 1,000 feet of distance. Neither of these objects made any noise.  For a second I thought they might have been helicopters because I heard a helicopter motor just as the second one was disappearing.  But then I realized that they weren’t because the helicopter noise was coming from behind the school (the south – where the object had just come from).  In fact I briefly saw the lights of the helicopter come from behind the school to confirm what I was thinking.  It didn’t follow the flight path of the lights as far as I could tell. I continued to walk and got to my street within about 10 minutes.  As I was walking down my street, I looked back in the general area in the sky where I had seen the two lights.  To my surprise I saw a third object that was completely different than the first two.  While the first two objects were high up like an airplane, this object was lower, about the height of a low flying helicopter.  It was moving in a straight line from south to north.  It’s difficult to describe its appearance because it had no discernible features.  If you can imagine a large plastic grocery bag (about the size of an SUV) flying through the air and changing shape in the wind, that’s how it looked.  Unlike the first two objects, it didn’t have any kind of light to it.  It was a white object that was visible due to the ambient light of the city.  It made no noise even though it was not too far over the rooftops.  I watched it travel for about 500 feet until the trees of my neighborhood obscured my vi! ew.;38.9066060549607;-77.0252989753134
