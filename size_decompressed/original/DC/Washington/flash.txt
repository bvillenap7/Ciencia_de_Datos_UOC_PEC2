Bright flash of light exploding off the horizon into space - Washington, DC;2004-07-17 18:10:00;Split second;Bright flash of light exploding off the horizon into space - Washington, DC Traveling south down 13th Street NW in Washington DC (a few blocks north of U street), I saw a an amazing flash of white light explode off the ground from the horizon upwards into the air/space and disapear. The entire affair lasted about 1/4 of a second but I am confident I saw something - what it is that I saw, I have no idea.  I am confident it was not some reflection off of the car window.  The size of the flash was quite narrow - if I had to guess the distance, it would be five to ten miles away from where we were driving. The size of the flash might be the equivilant of a nail in the wall viewed from five feet away.  I was traveling in the passenger's seat and the driver unfortunatly did not see the flash.;38.9066060549607;-77.0252989753134

I was the passenger in a 2013 Toyota white corolla.   I had my wife make a hasty report as I was eating sushi in Epping, NH, because I didn't want it to go without being reported.   The driver was a grade school friend of mine 37 years ago, known him my whole life.   Going over a bridge on 295 there was two pulses of energy (Light) White flashes that was beyond anything ive ever seen. we both turned to eachother and said, What ((deleted)) was that?   I understand they're a lot of hoax reports, but mine can be corroborated with a motorcycle police officer that had pulled over a car maybe a half a mile later on the left hand side of 295 north.  These two light pulses were symmetrical in strength and time.  It was almost like a picture flash but blindingly intense.   Not sure if this was government or ufo, just wanted to file this, as I have never in my life been a part of anything like this.  Still creeps me out. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the source of the report, and he seemed to us to be quite serious about the sighting.  PD));38.9066060549607;-77.0252989753134
