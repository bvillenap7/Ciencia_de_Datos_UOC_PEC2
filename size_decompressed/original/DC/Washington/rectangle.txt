((HOAX??))  I had the urge to buy Hersheys Kisses afterwards as I felt on a sugar low.  ((anonymous report));2018-09-21 22:00:00;2 minutes;I had the urge to buy Hersheys Kisses afterwards as I felt on a sugar low. I am a U.K. visitor to the U.S. on a family visit to Washington and on the way from their house to the airport, I saw something strage.   I then proceeded to witness a large rectangular glowing object appear at the side of the road.  It had some sort of strange inscriptions on it.  The colour was bright white, with red streaks across it.  It had long legs roughly 2m long touching the ground.   For some reason I couldn't avert my eyes, like it was advertising something great to me. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
