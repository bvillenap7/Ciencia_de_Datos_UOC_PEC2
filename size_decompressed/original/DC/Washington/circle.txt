I was lying on my back on the Mall right across the street from the Washington Memorial (my feet were facing the Capitol Building).  I was staring up at the sky (there were no clouds today) and noticed what I first thought was an airplane (because it was metallic and reflecting light) that was flying so high it looked like a little ball.  It was moving in a straight line, much like an airplane would.  Then, I noticed another one, same size, same description, but flying towards the first object.  I thought maybe they were planes flying at different altitudes, because it looked as though they were going to have a head-on collision.  I became anxious as I thought I was going to watch a plane wreck mid-air, but just as they were going to hit, they VERY QUICKLY (much faster than an airplane ever could) spun off in opposite circular directions.  They danced around each other in circles, occasionally disappearing then reappearing.  The most I saw at one time were 4.  Then, and actual airplane passed through my area of vision (flying much lower than the objects) and as it did, the objects disappeared totally.  After the plane had been gone for about a minute, one reappeared and continued to dance around, and another appeared.  Sometimes there were two, and sometimes one.  During the course of this, I stood up to observe, and sat down, and laid back down, just to make sure I wasn't contorting my body in a way that was effecting my vision.  But, these objects were clearly in focus, not just light spots created by poor sight.   Finally, I decided I had seen enough and wanted to leave.  I'm not one to make up stories (as most people probably say), and though I believe there is something out there, I NEVER thought I'd ever see anything like this.  There was no other explanation for what I saw today.  About two minutes after I left, I developed a very bad inner ear ache that lasted about a half hour...may be unrelated, but just thought I'd mention it.;38.9066060549607;-77.0252989753134
Small orbs circle the pentagon on Sept 11th;2001-09-11 09:00:00;1 min;Small orbs circle the pentagon on Sept 11th IFilm - plane strikes pentagon 2nd angle quicktime footage-  After the tomahawk missle hits the building  a small Mantis like mini helicopter flys by (raising the parking lot gate thing) and a  guy points at it then,  afew seconds later you can see a pair of small orbs  passing each other in perfect syncronization. The motion is perfect - they circle the area two times - about 3 or 4 feet off the ground -  this little movie shows how our technology compares to......who ever they are.....I'm not an Alien fanatic, but twice now i've seen with my own eyes what I know in my heart were displays of technology that are not of this world. 1st time at night in the skys off the coast of Boston ( a light in the sky moved - darted off at a speed we can't travel at ) and in broad daylight from my back yard in LA. ( dull metal colored disk - standing still - then vanished and I made sure I didn't blink - I could see it's shape clearly - very clear sky - no clouds at all) I asked my lady to explain what we both were looking at... she saw it. . . she won't talk about it - that's rare for her....I've only seen the little orb things on tv, but I think thats whats on the video @ ifilms ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

circular disc coming to a slight point-like the bottom of a top, only flatter-lights pointing at Andrews Air Force Base or Reagan Nat'l;2004-09-29 02:30:00;10 minutes;circular disc coming to a slight point-like the bottom of a top, only flatter-lights pointing at Andrews Air Force Base or Reagan Nat'l Returning home from work at 2:30 am, I started home to DC from Washington Street which becomes the George Washington Parkway. At the first stoplight (the one before the train tracks), I could see a VERY bright light about two miles away, near Reagan National Airport. My first thought was that a plane coming in for landing had turned in a way that created a beam which was brighter than usual. As I drove closer I realized the light was stationary--it was not moving. As I rounded the second entrance to the airport I saw a HUGE silver circle with beams of light directed toward the airport or to Andrews Air Force Base visible just across the Potomac. The disc was motionless and only about 100 feet off the ground. It was at a slight tilt and the lights were only coming out of the half closest to the ground. I slowed down to a crawl, watching the ship and all of a sudden it moved to above the 14th Street Bridge. It did this effortlessly, and I remember thinking that I had not really seen it move--it re-appeared above the 14th Street Bridge, and I got the feeling it knew I would be taking that exit. As I moved into the middle lane going into DC I could see it in my rear view mirror. There were other cars around me--I think I saw two on the Parkway, and maybe two or three behind me on the bridge. All of them should have seen this. Additionally, the ship was near the Boeing comples across from the airport. Certainly someone had caught this on a security tape or a controller had seen it from the airport.  When I got home I tried to call the airport only to find out that all the flights had been cancelled due to Hurricane ? (insert appropriate alphabetical name here). I have sent this in before,the night of the sighting, but I am submitting an electronic rendering that I had made the night of the sighting so I wouldn't forget details. The picture could not show the point that the craft came to--similar to the bottom of a top, but almost flat. There were green blinking lights and the red symbol is not accurate but there were some red symbols in that position. I seriously doubt this was a plane or Boeing experiment, and wish someone could see if there is evidence of it in any number of security cameras that should be in the area.;38.9066060549607;-77.0252989753134

The object flew across the sky at about the same speed as a shooting star however it never faded out or changed velocity.  The light coming from it flared a little as if it was a fire.  Because of how fast it was moving I only managed a few gazing seconds before it moved out of sight.;38.9066060549607;-77.0252989753134
