It had started to rain, and I didn't want to get my equipment wet, I took a 30-45 second exposure. In my image are unidentified Objects that are stationary. There are some objects with the same energy signature on the ground. Reported findins to US Capitol Police.;38.9066060549607;-77.0252989753134
Two UFO's Lingering In The Sky On October 31, Followed By Lights And Surrounded By Green Fog.  ((NUFORC Note:  Satellites??  PD));2007-10-31 21:45:00;about 1 hour;Two UFO's Lingering In The Sky On October 31, Followed By Lights And Surrounded By Green Fog, Every Dog Was Barking The Entire Time I just saw 2 ufo's outside on my balcony, it's halloween night in Washingron, DC on Glenbrook Road, I was looking at stars when I saw a ufo in the sky, I knew it wasn't a star because it was different looking. I knew it wasn't a plane or satallite because it wasn't moving fast or blinking. One was coming in a diagonal direction from the west the other from the east. I got my bionoculares and telescope to look at it up close. When I looked at the objects in both the telescope and bionoculars in focus and up close at the 2 ufo's, but when I directly looked at it through the telescope and bionoculars I could only see a unidentified fly object absolutely surrounded by a green-ish fog or laser type of thing and a bright light following them.  The entire 1 hour time peroid every single dog in the entire neighborhood were barking like mad and growling angerily constantly I could her it from inside my house.  All night there were planes coming in and out, but I live near a major airport. ((NUFORC Note:  Satellites??  PD));38.9066060549607;-77.0252989753134
A green colored sphere appeared out of nowhere and fell straight to the ground;2009-01-02 20:00:00;split second;A green colored sphere appeared out of nowhere and fell straight to the ground As I was driving eastward on the Capital Beltway (I-495) in the vicinity of Silver Spring, MD I saw in the sky to the Northest of Washington DC a green colored sphere.  I saw it for only a second, it seemed to appear out of nowhere and then immediately drop straight to the ground.  It looked extrememly large, and I fully expected to hear or see an explosion when it reached the ground.  I didn't see any such explosion.  I kept looking to the sky as I was driving and when I looked back at the road, I saw I was beginning to swerve out of my lane.  Several other cars ahead of me where also swerving out of their lanes as if they were also watching the sphere.  I heard no sounds during the sighting.;38.9066060549607;-77.0252989753134
Sighting of a large flying sphere near our nation's capital.;2009-12-09 23:00:00;one minute;Sighting of a large flying sphere near our nation's capital. At around 11pm, my friend and I were walking back to campus through a field, we saw a bright light moving in the distance getting bigger by the second as it came closer.  When it came within about 50 yards, it became apparent that the light was a spinning sphere of many lights with a metallic surface.  It stopped abruptly and hovered for about 10 seconds and sped off again.  As it hovered, it emitted an almost inaudible hum that you could feel in the air.   After calming down from our sighting, we called the authorities to report what we had seen but they were not receptive.   After our experience, we found your organization on the Internet and decided to contact you in hopes of confirming our sighting.  Thank you for your time. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report placed placed Washington in Pennsylvania.  We have corrected it above.  We spoke via telephone with the source of this report, and initially suspected that the call might be yet another prank telephone call from an American youth.  We may have erred in that initial suspicion, in which case, this may be a serious-minded report.  The written report appears to us to be composed in a responsible manner.

luminous craft with halo's in slow flight over the rooftops of the buildings;2010-04-30 20:45:00;1 minute;A friend and I went behind Ben's Chili Bowl In NW DC,   He was interested in my D700 Nikon.  I took 5 random pictures, one with daylight color balance, the next 4 with tungsten light balanced filters, variation in exposures, however in each were luminous craft with halo's in slow flight over the rooftops of the buildings I photographed for the cameras demonstration* I took each image from the same POV and with a fixed focal lens (50 mm).   The objects in sequence are in motion.  Taken at 20000 ISO (1/80th of a second -1/30th of a second exposures.  In each the objects are luminous and in different positions.  I have them in other samples**taken this night*  http://www.facebook.com/home.php#!/photo.php?pid=3941017&id=783309194;38.9066060549607;-77.0252989753134
2 luminous objects  over Washington Monument July 4, 2010;2010-07-04 21:11:00;1 second;2 luminous objects  over Washington Monument July 4, 2010 4th of July fireworks @ the Washington Monument, I was filming the fireworks display against the backdrop of the Washington Monument.   I set my camera to fire in continuous mode and fired 1140 frames from a stationary platform (tripod).   In 1 frame in the sequence of 1140 images, are 2 luminous objects?  These anomalies only appeared in 1 frame, so I looked at several frames before and after this one frame, and there is nothing?    I put all the HD frames in Combustion and generated a continuous motion sample of this event.  Upon analysis of the anomalies, there is some blur associated to motion however it seemed to be hyper dimensional, just in its attributes in this one sample.   This is not the first time I imaged this anomaly?   Imaged in HD using Remote Controlled D700 Nikon on a stationary platform (tripod).    All images taken in continuous sequence mode;38.9066060549607;-77.0252989753134
Moving star with beam of light;2010-07-20 03:10:00;5 minutes;Moving star with beam of light My wife and I went out to walk the dog.  While out we all saw a slow moving bright star!  I thought it was strange, the dog would not look away, and became agitated afterwards?  But what we think we saw, left us floored!  The damn thing emitted a tube of light.. I think Z saw red lights around it or moving away from it.   My wife does not want to talk or have me make this report, so please do not post my name!   I did not believe in UFO's until I saw this light!  Kirk to Enterprise: Beam me up? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous provides no contact information.

I went outside with my camera and camera platform (tripod) and fired 10 continuous frames of what I thought to be bright stars/planets?    After taking the images I went back into my home and transferred the HD data.  The 10 frames in sequence showed 1 constantly stationary star, and another object moving (vectoring) in the air in 1/4 inch increments (the object was moving fast!!) slightly deviating from its forwards trajectory*.   In the 10th frame..the object emitted what looks like a plasma beam!  The samples are most extraordinary*   Series analysis performed by Dr. Bruce Maccabee & W Allen ((NUFORC Note:  Photos were forwarded by the source of the report, who is well known to NUFORC.  The object in the photo is not inconsistent with the appearance of Jupiter, but we do not know what the object is.  PD));38.9066060549607;-77.0252989753134

Luminous spheres in flight, then suddenly vanishing into nothingness;2012-07-04 21:06:00;5.5 seconds;I generally film the fireworks at the Washington Monument, and setup a static HD motion picture camera in a fixed position.  Periodically, I would start and stop the video to check the video quality.  In one sequence of film, are luminous spheres, modulating in color (red/green), and in a formation.  The video captured the objects until they suddenly vanish one, by one, into the sir.  The objects are consistent with objects imaged over the US Capitol Building July 16, 1952. This is most spectacular video!  It shows these objects leaving (ascending) from a river, based on the camera POV in regard to the monument.  The film analysis shows luminous spheres in flight, then suddenly vanishing into nothingness.  Camera recorded HD video which is very unusual and showing objects with uniform consistency cloaking (vanishing) from screen.;38.9066060549607;-77.0252989753134
