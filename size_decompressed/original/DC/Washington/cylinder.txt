Up until 1:00 AM the weirdest thing I saw was a dumb guy climbing dangerously on a large tree.  I had no expectation of a UFO sighting then nor at anytime.  After the 12:00 fireworks and some music and laser lights (which were disappointing), I decided we (me and my friend) should start leaving, as the crowd was incredibly huge.  We walked through part of downtown DC including the George Washington University to the Foggy Bottom Metro Station.  As we got near the station the crowd swelled again as people try to get to the few escalators going down.  It took a very long time to get to the escalator, so I stood and listened and people-watched.  At about 1:00 AM there was the sound of explosions and it made me jump.  It was just the 2nd round of fireworks being launched from a barge in the Potomac River behind the Lincoln Memorial.  Thank God it wasn't real bombs.  All we could see were the flashes of light behind 12-story buildings and some reflections in office windows.  The fireworks lasted about 6 minutes, and after about 2-3 minutes of fireworks as I was inching my way along in the crowd, I noticed near the western horizon what appeared to be (a) shooting star(s).  I was not looking directly at it though.  I said to my friend, What good timing for shooting stars!  It's great to see that during the fireworks.  Then I saw more, and this time I got a better look at what they were.  (It also occurred to me later that the shooting star(s) never burned up in the atmosphere.)  I saw a pair of dark but lit cylindrical objects flying in formation from NW to SE passing almost directly above me.  Definitely not meteors.  They looked identical.  They moved at high speed, but I was able to see them well enough while they lasted, since I was now looking for more shooting stars.  Less than a minute later a single cylinder moved from WSW to ENE at about the same speed and had the same appearance.  I then ! said, to no one in particular and not loudly really, Am I seeing UFOs?  My friend was either caught up in the fireworks and/or crowd and didn't notice anything.  No one said anything after my last comment, but then very few people around me would have been able to hear me with so many people jabbering and the incredibly loud, echoing fireworks.  At this point I was almost at the beginning of the escalator.  I guess resistance is futile I felt I had no choice but to get on the thing.  If I could do it over again, I would have grabbed my friend and tried to get out of the way so I could hang around and look for more of these things, whatever they were.  I have searched the Washington Post's of the last few days but have not been able to find anything on any UFO sightings.  I am now searching the internet for the same (for the first time) and happened upon this site.  I hope this helps me resolve what it was I saw.  I am keeping a wide-open mind and not jumping to conclusions.  Anyone else?  Please speak up if you saw them.  Thanks!;38.9066060549607;-77.0252989753134

It would be be;2006-11-10 08:20:00;30 Seconds;Sighting recorded Friday November 10th, 8:20AM.  I witnessed an object off the lower left side of the plane (South/West).   It would be best described as silver, cylindrical, shaped like a cigar tube.  No Windows, Wings, Identifyable Marks or Propulsion source.   It was half way between our plane and the ground.  Taking into account the speed our plane was travelling, the object was either hovering or moving very slow in a South West direction along a parallel flight path with the ground.  No erratic movement noted.  I was on a Continental Airline flight. The plane departed at 7AM from West Palm Beach, FL, en route to Newark, NJ.  We landed in Newark at about 9:30 AM.  I have never witnessed an unusual object such as this before. The sighting lasted approximately 30 seconds.  There was not time enough to get the attention of anyone else on the plane.  The object appeared to be slightly less than half distance between our plane and the ground.  I understand commercial aircraft generally travel at 35,000 feet, if this is the case, it would be my estimate that the object was located at about 17,000 feet.   Visability was perfectly clear. There were no clouds anywhere.  I cannot provide a comparison of the object to the sun, since my line of view was from above the object looking downward. I struggle to comprehend the actual size of the witnessed object.  It was large enough that it was clear and distinct but otherwise small from my point of view.  In comparison to objects on the ground, it was bigger than the size of a large house on the ground. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and we found him to be quite lucid, and emphatic, as to the very real nature of his sighting.  PD));38.9066060549607;-77.0252989753134
Cylindrical object over Washington D.C. viewd from near Smithsonian Metro Station;2008-08-13 20:00:00;3 to 5 min;Cylindrical object over Washington D.C. viewd from near Smithsonian Metro Station My friends and I went on a trip to Washington D.C. on August 13 2008, at about 8:00 pm or a little after we were walking west on the mall towards the Smithsonian Metro Station when I noticed an object in the sky.  It appeared to be cylindrical in shape and dark, gray maybe or a dull metallic color it was relatively well offset by the colors of the evening sky so it was plainly visible to the naked eye.  It seemed to be fairly large and distant it stayed completely stationary for some time.  After I first noticed it I didnâ€™t point it out until I realized that it had not moved at all for close to 30 sec.  I pointed it out to my 4 friends who all saw I but we could not decided what it was, the general consensus seemed to be that it might be a kite of some sort but to me it seemed too high in the sky and large, also the area of the sky it was in did not see like a place where anyone would fly a kite of any sort.  I pulled out my cell phone to take a picture the clouds behind the object could be seen on the screen the but object did not appear despite that fact that as I mentioned before it was plainly visible to the naked eye, a fact that I pointed out to my friends, and all of my group saw it.  If I recall I also heard someone in another group we passed mention noticing it.  The object remained stationary for several minutes thereafter until it moved slightly down and to the right and from view. 	The object was perhaps 30 to 40 degrees in the sky to the WNW, generally in the area of the sky between the Washington monument and the White House but probably more distant.  It particularly struck me as odd because this is not a residential area, and as far as I know restricted air space, also this is the area of the sky were aircraft approach Regan National airport.;38.9066060549607;-77.0252989753134

I took 1500 frames. In 6 frames 6-7 minutes into the show, a black cylinder darts through the frame and is imaged in 5 frames (1.5 seconds) of action.

My family and I saw something fly over head silently and without lights.;2011-07-04 21:15:00;2 seconds;Parked on 14th street bridge during fireworks display, my family and I saw something fly over head silently and without lights.  It was black or carbon, and we all watched this object fly over.   Can anybody tell me whats up or if anyone else saw something?  I am in the US Military and have never seen anything like that.   I do not wish to be contacted or named ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  One of six reports from same source.

Luminous object thought to be a star?;2011-12-11 20:08:00;4 seconds;Luminous object thought to be a star? Taking random sky scans using 200 mm F 2.8 lens @ 20000 ISO, I decided to take stationary platform shots of the stars on a relatively clear night.  I fired 23 continuous frames in high speed mode using a RC D700 Nikon.  I focused on the stars and started taking a series of rapid fire images.  I had to focus on a star, and set the lens to manual, then start the burst of frames with the remote control.   When I loaded the data into the computer, one of the objects thought to be a star was in motion.  The samples show the object, though in a straight flight trajectory, the frames show this object was sweeping, each exposure sample showed a different flight angular positioning of this object relative to the stars around it.  I have 19 continuous frames showing this object taken from a RC camera*  It was luminous like the stars*, and way up in the sky, it would not have been visible by the human eye*;38.9066060549607;-77.0252989753134
