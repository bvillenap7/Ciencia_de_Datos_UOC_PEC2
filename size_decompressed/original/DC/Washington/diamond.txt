I looked around to find where the noise came from and i looked in the sky and their was about 22 or 23 of these diamond shaped flying objects.   I was in the air force for about 6 years, and i have never seen any aircraft shaped or osund like this one, i wanted to see if their was anyone else who had seen these ufo-like things, nad i found a man, sitting on a nearby bench, their was a homeless man who was speaking franticly about the crafts, and he ran off, i tried to stop him, and all these other people were being drawn to the attention that the homeless man had drawned to himself, i met a woman, she was a newspaper editor, and she told me that those were ufo's and i agreed with her that i have never seen anything like it, then 11 minutes passed, and later on, when the light started to come up around 1:10 a.m., and the ufo's faded away and nobody else admitted to seeing them.
