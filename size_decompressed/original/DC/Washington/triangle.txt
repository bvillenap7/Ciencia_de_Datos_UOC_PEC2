Three lights in a triangular formation being followed by a smaller light.;2001-12-14 23:30:00;1-2 minutes;Three lights in a triangular formation being followed by a smaller light. Watching the meteor shower, I noticed two lights that seemed to be changing directions in their movement.  The brighter of the two was actually three lights in a triangular formation.  The smaller light followed the triangular lights back and forth across the sky.  They were faster than a jet airplane but not extraordinarily fast moving.  They seemed to be at a medium altitude, perhaps 5,000 - 10,000 feet or perhaps less.  This made the actual size of the object undeterminable. After some time the triangular light vanished in an instant and the other light turned in the opposite direction and flew off towards the horizon.  Living near Andrews Air Force Base, it was assumed that this was an air force action but the triangular shape is what sparked my curiosity and made me think that something unusual was going on.  It may very well be an air force plane of some sort but it remains for me a UFO none the less.;38.9066060549607;-77.0252989753134
Three orange triangular lights in the Washington, DC sky during the Leonids.;2002-11-19 05:25:00;30 seconds;Three orange triangular lights in the Washington, DC sky during the Leonids. While observing the Leonid meteor shower in a crisp clear dark sky, my wife and seven year old son and I watched three orange triangular lights zip overhead, in very tight formation, from east to west.  At first, we considered that they were F-16s that have been flying over DC on patrol.  But there was no audible, as is typical with the F-16 overhead flights.  Suddenly the lights merged, spread apart, the left lead light zipping away at almost 90 degrees, before the lights zipped quickly to the western horizon out of sight, obsured by the then full moon.;38.9066060549607;-77.0252989753134
This is my second report of these Triangular shapped flying objects with red flashing lights.  This second sighting compelled me to rep;2006-04-16 23:00:00;20 minutes;This is my second report of these Triangular shapped flying objects with red flashing lights.  This second sighting compelled me to report it.  My last sighting was two years ago in 2004 in New Jersey.   This sighting occured in Washington, D.C. in April of 2006.  I was at a friend's house and the three of us decided to go outside on the apartment balcony and smoke a cigarette.   While we were out there I saw small flying aircrafts that were flashing red lights.  It reminded me of my sighting two years ago and brought back memories.  I realized it was the same objects.  I recognized the speed of the red flashing objects.   Again, my friends being very skeptical just assumed they were airplanes but not me.  No way, this is the second time that these objects came around.  This time in Washington, D.C.  They moved the same way in all types of directions.   The flying objects disappared after a short time, maybe 10 minutes.  Then after that I saw other aircrafts which looked like helicopters with spot lights just like my first sighting flying around the area.   We didn't stick around to see the helicopters fly around but they were gone after 30 minutes.  Again I  assume it is a UFO or something government related.  Especially since it happened in Washington, D.C.   You never really know with the government.   I don't know if they were any other outside witnesses but I have done some research online and have seen some forums with other witnesses of the same event.  I just decided to report this stuff since it was my second sighting of the same thing but in different states. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

black triangular object with three red lights underneath it flying over DC;2006-05-17 00:30:00;10 seconds;black triangular object with three red lights underneath it flying over DC I was driving south on the 295 interstate coming out of downtown DC where I work. It was the early am of 17 May 06, Wednesday at about 12:20 am. I was headed south and as I approached the area of Bolling AFB (to the right) and the Naval Research Lab on the 295 I saw the side view shape of a Stealth aircraft......nothing else has that shape....flying over the interstate headed in the direction of the AFB..to the right. I then looked to the left side of the 295 and saw a black triangular shaped craft with 3 red circular lights in each corner of the triangle flying over the area across from the Naval Research Lab. The stealth appeared to be escorting the craft. the triangle was descending and appeared to go down in an area with a very high treeline. The treeline is thick and dense with a fence that stretches the entire distance of the trees.;38.9066060549607;-77.0252989753134

I was standing outside my apartment building, and I happened to look up, and I saw a black triangular object flying north to south.  It was clearly illuminated by the moon.  It was totally silent.  Of course I kept my eyes on the sky.  A few minutes later I see a chemtrail plain as day, or rather by night illuminated by the moon.  Thats the last I saw as the trail moved east to west.;38.9066060549607;-77.0252989753134
