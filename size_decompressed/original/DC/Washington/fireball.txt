Intensely fast green glowing fireball crossed the sky from nw to se over the Washington DC beltway and went below the viewable horizon.;1999-04-14 22:30:00;15 seconds;Intensely fast green glowing fireball crossed the sky from nw to se over the Washington DC beltway and went below the viewable horizon. While driving along the Capital Beltway at about 830 at night, I was headed south on the outerlook near the Rt. 50 exit.  Because my tops were off on my car, I noticed a extremely fast green fireball race across the sky overhead moving from nw to se.  The fireball was first noticed just above my head and then flew inside the Washington DC beltway and headed off in the direction of Andrews airforce base.  If the object was at 30000 feet, it would have to be moving in excess of 20,000 mph.  Since it was dark and the object looked like nothing I had ever seen, I could not judge the altitude.  I have watched meteor showers and this was like nothing I had ever seen.  Much more bright and colorful.  Plus, there was no trail like I always see with a meteor shower.  It did look like the object had a bit of green haze around it but not much.  I cannot overstate how bright the object was.  Anyone outside would have noticed it and there had to be other people who saw it.  It moved across about 40 degrees of sky in less than 7 seconds.  It traveled from zenith to 40 degrees where I lost it through the trees but could see it move further se through gaps in the branches and as much as I could keep my car from wrecking.;38.9066060549607;-77.0252989753134

Delta 434 reported flaming falling object which left a visible contrail.;2001-07-23 18:20:00;15-20 Mins ?;Delta 434 reported flaming falling object which left a visible contrail. This is no joke. At about 1820 EDT Delta 434 and a couple of other aircraft reported to Wash Center (133.725) a large flaming falling object which left a visible contrail. The first report stated that a large ball of flame was noted passing by the aircraft at their 10 o'clock position.  After the object passed by he reported a large, visible contrail along the object's downward path. The first aircraft reported the object as a daytime meteor. The object's downward movement and contrail was confirmed by at least three other aircraft. No geographic references were noted in any of the reports so I can't tell you exactly where this all happened. The freq serves the Wash Center sector around Gordonsville & Flat Rock, just east of Richmond VA.;38.9066060549607;-77.0252989753134

Fireball Over Capitol Hill- Very Long Deep Blue Tail- During Anti- War Rally;2007-01-27 12:30:00;4 seconds;Fireball Over Capitol Hill- Very Long Deep Blue Tail- During Anti- War Rally I witnessed a huge aerial event over Washington, D.C., while attending the Jan. 27 Anti- War Rally and March. A fireball streaking high overhead from south to north, it was a DAYTIME SIGHTING, the persistent long tail was bright color of electric- arc blue mixed with violet- the color and brightness appearing like lightning from this witness' perspective, the head of the object grew larger as it moved from my right to left high in the sky, directly over the U.S. Capitol and behind the speaker's stage- I was located in the Mall between the Capitol and the Washington Monument, facing east, standing almost directly in front of the speakers stage about 100 feet back when I saw this object streak overhead  about half- way through the scheduled speakers presentations. I was awed and blown away for quite a while, and I wondered whether anybody else in the crowd witnessed this !  I was initially frightened by the streak or dart of light I saw in the sky over Capitol Hill- I thought at first a big firework, then I saw how high up it was- thousands of feet, or several miles- and then I thought missile, and the fireball got somewhat larger as it traveled, -and I actually expected an explosion with sound- but only silence happened, and the tail faded without leaving any smoke or cloud whatsoever. The tail of a normal meteor would have left a thin remnant smoke or cloud trail like a contrail- but I repeatedly sought for a wisp of smoke to try to understand what I was seeing- and saw only CLEAR BLUE SKY AND SUN- BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER ! AND my early impression is this was LIKE AN ARROW ! Why ? Because the tail was very long and persisted way too long to be a normal meteor. You see, a normal meteor is colored incandescent white or bright sun- yellow, with a short tail because the tail tracks closely to the head of the meteor ( look at videos of the unfortunate shuttle reentry loss ). But THIS object- the tail continued for at least 20 degrees of sky, the entire display faded all at once, and the color of the tail was electric- arc blue- like an arc welder, but deeper blue- fringed with violet- FULL LENGTH- and I think the head of the object, as it progressed and grew bigger, was more violet than blue. Moving south to north, from the direction of the sun towards north.  I turned and looked at the faces of the crowd together with the media risers close behind me- NO REACTION AT ALL ! That really bothered me, too !;38.9066060549607;-77.0252989753134
Glowing orb with sharp turns in Washington ,DC;2009-05-27 23:00:00;4 minutes;Glowing orb with sharp turns in Washington ,DC It was a humid night, a little hazy, you could see the moon and maybe one star. I was in Meridian Hill Park in NW Washington, DC. looking at the sky around 9:30 pm I saw a strange light moving slowly across the sky heading South.  It abruptly made a 90 degree left to the East then after a while appeared to be lowering and faded out.  It looked like a large bright planet, a warm colored glowing orb. I couldn't tell how high up it was, but I think it was about 200ft when it faded out.   My friend who was with me had seen a diamond shaped UFO up close as a 10 year old and also seen others just like this one. It didn't seem to be moving that fast but did cover a large area in a short time.  It faded out what appeared to be near Howard Univeristy Hospital (or on 14th near Belmont st) to the north west of the Capitol. If anyone has any idea what that might have been, please let me know.;38.9066060549607;-77.0252989753134
a vectoring orange streak, which at the end of forwards vectoring, makes a sudden 90 degree turn?;2009-08-19 20:57:00;2 seconds;At 20:57 PM I photographed a high speed sequence of images of abstract clouds that were above my home?  The technology allowed me to image, exactly what I was focused on (clouds). However in the sequence of images are  what starts as a stationary orange anomaly in the clouds? In each proceeding image, is a vectoring orange streak, which at the end of forwards vectoring, makes a sudden 90 degree turn? In each representation of this anomaly, a streak of light which peaks brightness only in various shots?  The anomaly, matches the anomaly which landed in front of me in Baltimore 08/03/08 http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/065/S65053.html, however this time I have it vectoring in the sky?  Unlike anything I have ever seen? http://www.facebook.com/UFOdc?ref=profile#/album.php?aid=98539&id=783309194 http://www.facebook.com/UFOdc?ref=profile#/video/video.php?v=122114149194;38.9066060549607;-77.0252989753134
Red flaming object flying low over Washington DC with no sound;2010-08-28 22:06:00;2 minutes;Red flaming object flying low over Washington DC with no sound At the indicated time, my wife and I observed what appeared to be a red flaming object heading over Northwest Washington DC.  We reside in a high rise building and lost sight of the object after about 2 minutes as it travelled over our building.   I was able to go onto the patio of our residence and could not hear any sound coming from the object.  It was moving at a pace consistent with air traffic , but was outside of the normal areas where we have previously seen air traffic and had no flashing lights that one would expect to see on a traditional aircraft.   The object was at an altitude that I would estimate at between 2,000 to 3,000 feet and appeared to be travelling parallel to the ground, not increasing or decreasing in altitude.  The object appeared similar to a rocket, although all that I was able to make out was the flame.  The flame was distinctly red and lacked the white or yellow colorations that I have seen when observing several shuttle launches! .   The object was heading towards the Potomac Maryland area.  The object was flying in a straight path. I am a financial services executive and have never previously reporting anything of this nature.  Given the security parameters in place in the Washington DC area, I would hope that someone would have information on this object.   I am reporting it in hopes that someone can provide me with an explanation of what this very unusual object was.  It was flying low enough that it should have emitted some type of sound and I was amazed that I could hear no noise at all.   Also the red coloration was very unusual.   Would appreciate any information.;38.9066060549607;-77.0252989753134
