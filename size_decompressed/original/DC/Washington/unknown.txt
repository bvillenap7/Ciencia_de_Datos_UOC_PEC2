It ran North/South,was white in color against the blue sky and had what appeared to be circles or lines across it running East/West at equal intervals across the entire visable length. It was not other contrails cutting across it.  They were short lines. I have never seen a contrail anything like this ever and have no idea what produced it and there has to be lots and lots of other observers.  I dont know if an aircraft or type of UFO produced this,but if airplane,its not anything I have ever seen before. NOTE: I come from an aviation family, have been flying, and flying in planes my entire life and for me to make note of a contrail after seeing countless thousands,(some up close), then it has to be something that is significant and very very strange.;38.9066060549607;-77.0252989753134
Unusual Contrail..had evenly spaced lines across the entire length of the contrail;2000-10-15 12:30:00;5 minutes;Unusual Contrail..had evenly spaced lines across the entire length of the contrail I observed a contrail unlike any other I have ever seen before..It was crossed by lines evenly spaced the entire length of the contrail..they almost looked like circles around the line spaced out evenly. There were many other contrails in the sky that day..(blue sky,no clouds) and none crossed this contrail,all ran parallel to this one.

'Unidentified Ground Object' Spotted in Northwest, Washington, DC;2015-10-17 13:00:00;10 seconds;'Unidentified Ground Object' Spotted in Northwest, Washington, DC I was walking in my backyard towards my driveway when my cat, who was also in the backyard, suddenly froze staring at the base of a tree.  It then took a few steps backwards, turned around, and ran full speed to the door on the other side of the house (to be let back inside).  I looked around the tree to see what had frightened the cat, but there was nothing there, so I turned and took a few steps away, but decided to quickly look back one last time.  That's when I saw this object running from the tree to behind the trash barrels located near the end of the driveway.  It was about 12-15 ft. from me and in my direct line of sight on a bright, sunny day.  I was very startled, and decided to first let the cat back into the house.  A few minutes later I walked over to the trash barrels, but there was nothing there. The object appeared to 2 dimensional (like a geometrically shaped cardboard cutout), and it seemed able to camouflage itself (like a cuttlefish, or something I'd expect to be created in a DARPA lab).   The object’s legs appeared to be moving rapidly, but it’s movement was comparatively slow as if it wasn’t getting good traction.  The object was approximately 18 inches tall.  It was shaped like a small black sphere with a pie shaped cutout (similar to the outline of an astronaut’s helmet) over a black triangular shaped mid section, and a barely visible pair of legs below the mid section. I don't expect others to believe me, as I wouldn't believe such a story if it was told to me. Never-the-less, I’ve reported what I had seen, because I couldn't attribute it to being a shadow, glare, or another rational explanation, and perhaps others also spotted it. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be sincere.  However, he provides only a first name, and a minimum of contact information.  We are uncertain as to the authenticity of the report.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));38.9066060549607;-77.0252989753134
Buzzing Lighted Craft.  ((anonymous report));2017-12-21 06:24:00;1 minute;Buzzing Lighted Craft Saw a flying object with red, green, and white lights flying low over D.C. towards the Potomac, then changed direction NW back into D.C.   The object made a strange buzzing noise, not the sound of a helicopter, which is why I paid close attention to it.
