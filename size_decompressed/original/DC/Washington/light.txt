Million Man March had visitors?;1995-10-15 22:00:00;10 Minutes;Million Man March had visitors? On October 15th I drove to our Nation's Capital to do some vending at the Million Man March. I parked my red GMC SUV right behind my vending spot, set up my tables, and began to unload my supplies. I had several people working with me and I also saw many other venders that I know setting up as well. There were alot of people walking around the area, shopping, eating, and just taking in the scenary. I took out my VHS camcorder and began to talk and film people in the area. At some point I looked up into the sky and noticed it was full of stars. I've always enjoyed looking at the stars and have never seen a more spectacular night than this one. I noticed a star moving slightly back and forth. I was fatigued this evening from the long drive and other things I had to do that night and at first I thought I was just seeing things. After another look I was sure I wasn't seeing things. I made a comment to somebody standing close to me if they had ever seen a UFO and pointed towar ds the object. His response was if that's a UFO..what's THAT? and pointed the opposite direction. The star he pointed out was making little circular motions. I began to tell other people in the area to look up while I scanned the sky for other stars. I saw at least 50 other stars making subtle movements. I tried to catch this on video but my camera barely works with good lighting. The only thing I caught on tape was our voices and reaction to the sighting. I watching the stars moving for about 10 minutes and then continued to unpack my supplies and later fell asleep in my jeep. When I woke up the events at the Million Man March had already begun and I was late getting started. I sold out everything I had in just a few hours and never looked up even once that day. I have friends who did and saw close up in the day what I probably saw that night. They described them as looking like clouds and changing into silver metalic disks.;38.9066060549607;-77.0252989753134
I observed two small lights cross the night sky from approximately Orion to the North Star.  They appeared to be chasing one another.;2000-03-03 22:05:00;10 seconds;I observed two small lights cross the night sky from approximately Orion to the North Star.  They appeared to be chasing one another. I am a ((title and agency are deleted--witness is a federal employee))  in Washington, DC.  I was ((deleted))  near the Lincoln Memorial and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial when the following events occurred.  I was standing in Constitution Gardens on the north side of the pond, looking approximately southwest towards Orion.  I saw what I at first took to be a shooting star because of its speed and the way it seemed to be falling or dropping, but it didn't fade away the way falling stars usually do.  Then I saw that there were actually two lights which were moving along parallel to each other.  The lights were small and white with a pale greenish tinge.  I thought it might be an airplane with a light on either wingtip, but the lights were not flashing, and they seemed to be moving too fast for an airplane.  As I watched, the two lights converged into one, and then changed again so that one appeared to be following or chasing the other.  The rear light seemed to be swinging back and forth behind the path of the front light.  It crossed my mind that they might be fighter planes, but they looked like they were much too close together, and there was no noise (I noticed this because a few seconds after they disappeared, a regular airplane went by in approximately the same location, and I could clearly hear it).  The lights were headed almost directly towards the North Star, but a little lower on the horizon.  They disappeared into the lights of the city.  I looked at my watch and it was 10:05 pm - the entire incident had taken about 10 seconds.  I immediately went back to the ((deleted)) and wrote everything down, because it seemed like such a peculiar event, and the lights did not strike me as being normal airplanes.;38.9066060549607;-77.0252989753134
UFO sighting during President speech;2002-06-06 18:08:00;35 approx.;UFO sighting during President speech During the President speech about homeland security an object was visible outside the window of the foyer. It was a circular light and could have been taken for a reflex in the glass at first. However the object light changed intensity and dimension. Furthemore the object kept moving back and forth the President head, up and down and diagonally in typical UFO fashion. It is visible in intermittence for the whole duraion of the speech on the left side of the head of the President. ((NUFORC Note:  We received several reports about the unidentified lights seen during the President's speech.  We see nothing about the lights that would cause a reasonable person to conclude that they were genuine UFO's.  We suspect either reflection off the inside of the window behind the President, or landing lights on aircraft landing at Ronald Reagan Airport.  PD));38.9066060549607;-77.0252989753134
coloured moving lights over washington;2002-07-25 00:30:00;5 minutes;coloured moving lights over washington in 2002 we had a holiday in cuba, 10th - 24 july,  on the way home i saw something that will stay with me until the day i die,  the flight path home took us along the eastern side of the usa, i had a window seat and whil over land i like to look out at the scene below, as we were passing over washington i looked out of the  airplane window and saw 'lights' that i assumed was maybe lightening but the movements of these lights made me realise it was something more, i tried to show my husband but as i pointed out where the lights were they would suddenly 'jump' moving at great speed and he would miss them, fascinated i watched for as long as i could which was only a few minutes as the plane was moving away from them.  the lights were coloured, blue, orange, red, violet, it seemed as though i was watching something spinning and the colour changed as the object turned,  it would be in one place, revolving for a few seconds and then it would be gone only to reappear in a different part of the sky, there was more than one object and there seemed to be a pattern to the movement, it was unlike anything i had ever seen befor,  i knew i would see something about these lights in the paper and sure enough a couple of days later there was a report in the daily mail about the u.f.o over washington;38.9066060549607;-77.0252989753134
Light hovering in sky that jerked and wobbled about, surrounded by brief flashes of light;2003-01-27 02:30:00;1 hour;Light hovering in sky that jerked and wobbled about, surrounded by brief flashes of light From my bedroom window I saw a strange, flashing light hovering about 5 miles in the sky.  At first, I thought it was a star or plane, but then realized it was generally stationary, but jerking erratically.  It flashed and changed color frequently.  Occasionally, brief, smaller flashed of light popped up around it.  These flashes, and the main craft were white, and sometimes yellow. ((NUFORC Note:  We believe that the star, Sirius, seen in the southern sky at this time, would have to be ruled out, before we would consider a UFO as the explanation for this sighting.

A formation of about 20 pale lights moved slowly across the Washington, D.C. evening sky.;2004-03-02 20:30:00;1 minute;A formation of about 20 pale lights moved slowly across the Washington, D.C. evening sky. My husband and I were sitting outside on a small backyard patio (typical of Georgetown/D.C. row houses)when my attention was drawn to look upward at 20 or so pale lights -- about the size of large stars -- moving slowly across the night sky.  I looked around to see what this could be a reflection from, but realized that these were objects and they were moving slowly, and several from time to time quickly broke their formation, darting sideways and forward.  The lights moved as a general large cluster, with individual lights quickly moving forward and sideways, but still maintaining the general formation.  We watched for a little more than a minute -- time for me to ask, Are you seeing what I'm seeing? and to get up from my chair and walk the length of the patio and watch until the objects simply flew out of sight.  Weird.  Never thought I'd be reporting something like this . . .  Would love an explanation. Would also like to know if anyone else saw this.;38.9066060549607;-77.0252989753134
Lights moving in a counterclockwise oval pattern;2004-05-21 22:42:00;five minutes;Lights moving in a counterclockwise oval pattern Witness One: On Friday evening, May 21, 2004,  I was watching television in bed.  At approximately 10:30 pm, an electrical storm began to develop.  I was beginning to get sleepy and was considering turning the television off and going to sleep.  When there were two very rare bursts of static on the television about a minute apart (both at 10:42, according to my TiVo clock),  my decision to go to sleep was made since I also feared that it might not be safe to leave the television on any longer.  I pressed the record button on my TiVo so that I could finish watching the program at another time, very likely made a quick trip to the bathroom (though I'm not sure), took off my glasses (I'm very near sighted), and got back into bed.  I lay down on my left side facing the large panoramic windows in my bedroom.  Even with my very impaired vision, I immediately became aware of some lights moving in the sky in a way I'd never seen before.  I immediately sat up, retrieved my glasses from the night table, and put them on.  Outside my window and over Rock Creek Park and a large residential building across the street, balls of light were moving rapidly and a bit jerkily in an oval-shaped counterclockwise pattern.  It's difficult to say exactly how many there were, but I believe that four individual lights  would be a good estimate.  After watching them for a stunned minute or two, I got out of bed, and went next door to get my sister.  Together we stood at the window and watched this light show for approximately five minutes.  Towards the end, the lights seemed to simply fade away through the heavy cloud cover until there was only one left.  That light eventually faded as well.  I did not look at the clock again until after my sister left.  The time was 10:58.  Though I've called them balls of light, they weren't perfectly spherical.  There was no hard edge to them, though I do believe there was a brighter intensity at the center of each.  During the entire event, they kept moving in the same circular pattern – very, very rapidly and very, very erratically,  Though pinpointing precisely where they were is tough, I recall that my sister and I both stooped a bit to get a full view of the show.  (I usually have the blinds in my bedroom about 1/3 of the way down.)  I forgot until Saturday evening when I turned on my television and my TiVo that I had recorded during the exact time of the event.  Because I'm very sure that it was the second burst of static that caused me to turn off the television, I can time the start of the event (using the TiVo clock) at precisely 10:42.  In retrospect, the static on the television is very interesting.  Our cable service is very reliable here and is not affected by the weather at all.  Neither my sister nor I can ever recall seeing bursts of static since we've had this service (more than four years) and they are dramatic.  Both are preserved on my TiVo.  I'll add one other observation.  Living in Washington, DC,  during the months after September 11 we became very used to hearing the jets patrolling our skies.  They were always audible, sometimes even loud enough to awaken you.   Though we no longer (or only rarely) hear those jets anymore, contrails are always visible.  I have watched contrails being formed (almost daily, in fact) and, while you can spot the object making them with the naked eye, it is completely silent.  On the morning of January 8th of this year,  I was so startled by a pattern of contrails in the sky outside the same bedroom window that I took digital photos of them.  There were at least 20 (and maybe even more) in a very narrow area and I had a hard time imagining how that many planes could fly so closely together without anyone hearing a thing.  Witness Two: On the evening of Friday, 5/21/04 I was in my bedroom reading.  A very powerful thunderstorm had been right over our building for approximately ten minutes when my sister came into my room and asked me to come look at something.  I glanced at the clock and noted that it was 10:46PM.  She asked me to look out the window in her bedroom at the sky over Rock Creek Park.  I saw at different times 1, 2, 3, or 4 blurry, yet distinct white lights moving counterclockwise in an apparent oval shaped orbit.  The cloud cover was heavy, but my perception was that the lights were within or circling one particular cloud.  The lightning was intense and lit up the entire sky several times as we watched the lights. The lights moved constantly in an erratic, jerky fashion, seemingly unaffected by the lightning.  Their movement appeared ghostly to me and I thought of Casper cartoons.  Their shape is harder to describe.  Narrow at the bottom and wider at the top is close – almost torch-like with indistinct edges.  It was my impression that their blurry, undefined appearance was due to the cloud cover and extremely hazy skies.  After about ten minutes the intensity of brightness dimmed and I realized that only one light was still visible as it gradually disappeared.  The storm raged on for another few minutes.  My sister and I talked for a minute or two and I went back to my room at approximately 11:00PM.;38.9066060549607;-77.0252989753134
3-4 crazy star-like objects moving at very high speeds and direction change. defies convention. I saw over D.C!;2004-10-31 20:00:00;10-15 seconds;3-4 crazy star-like objects moving at very high speeds and direction change. defies convention. I saw over D.C! Myself and two friends were visiting a friend in D.c. on Halloween night.  3 of us went to the new world war 2 memorial.  This memorial is a man-made island, located in the heart of the city, to the west of the washington monument-- which you can see in the reflection of the pond surrounding the memorial.  All of us were smoking cigarettes and looking up at the stars, which were fairly prevelant this night, though there was some cloud coverage.  One friend spotted what seemed to be a star, moving about at an insane speed, in no one particular direction or course. Two to three more objects that also looked like stars appeared in the sky with the first object.  The objects now, which were a light white, close to the color of any random star, looked like they were playing almost, looping around one another, and changing direction and speed in ways  we believed to be completely impossible for any craft of our knowledge.  The objects would hover and accelerate and take up so much distace in the sky in an instant.  These objects also moved backwards, and there was certainly no turing radius either, they stopped on a dime, and flew backwards and loopty looped and the crafts chased one another in these formations and in a figure eight sort of design. They then dissapeared behind very high clouds. All the objects were fairly dim, and very far away, and it would have been extremely hard to catch this event if you weren't directly watching the sky, as we were.  We are 100 percent sure of what we saw and i know there are reports similar to ours that also occured over washington. Please do not allow this siting to be dismissed.  We are intelectual individuals ranging in age from 17-20.;38.9066060549607;-77.0252989753134

The intensity remained the same as it moved in a straight line at a slow rate of speed for about 5 seconds before disappearing.  It was not blinking and did not appear to be an airplane or a meteor.  My guess was that it was a satellite, except within a matter of minutes a second light appeared in precisely the same spot as where the first appeared, was of slightly greater intensity, and moved across the same path as the first before disappearing.  The possibility of two satellites on the same trajectory only minutes apart seemed odd.;38.9066060549607;-77.0252989753134

For weeks, I had observed a bright luminous celestial body in the sky I couldn’t identify.  The object would rise in the east and proceed in a westerly direction.  I was pretty certain that it was not Sirius and it shown so brightly that it had me captivated and perplexed.  I mentioned it to an acquaintance who happens to be a professional photographer and UFO Hunter. On the morning of July 20, 2010, I called him at 3:00 am and asked him to go outside and take photos of the star so that we could figure out what it was.  It was larger and brighter than any star I’ve ever seen even Venus. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

My housemate knocked on my door and woke me up, claiming there were strange flashes of light in the sky.  We both went outside.  As soon as we were outside I observed repeatedly flashing bright white light in the night sky.  It looked almost like lightning, however there was no thunder and the light was continuously flashing and lighting up the whole sky.  After about 15 minutes of the repeatedly flashing light, a very large cloud quickly covered the entire sky in a matter of a few minutes.  Shortly after the cloud moved in a very large ball of light appeared behind the cloud.  At first it looked like the moon shining through a cloud.  I then noticed the moon was actually very far away from this strange light source.  The light source then began to move around.  It flashed a brilliant green light and then moved around again.  Then it flashed a bright orange light and began to move around again.  Suddenly there was a huge gust of wind and the object disappeared.;38.9066060549607;-77.0252989753134
6 glowing objects fly near roof. (reoccuring);2012-08-09 03:00:00;10 minutes;6 glowing objects fly near roof. (reoccuring) On two separate occasions I witnessed glowing objects in flight that ranged in size from firefly size to navel orange size. The first sighting happened Tuesday August 7, 2012 at approximately 11:30 pm. I was sitting on the deck with my friend and about 60 yards away in the distance we saw glowing objects flying right above a 2 story house in front of the chimney.  From what I could tell, they were round, or spherical objects that could change their size.  At the very least they would appear to be the size of a firefly but much brighter, and at times the objects would appear to grow to the size of a navel orange, but then shrink and disappear.  I watched these objects fly around for about 15 minutes. I walked away for 10 minutes then returned and the objects were still there.  On Friday August 10, 2012 at approximately 3 AM I witnessed the objects again, they were flying around in the same place as before.  This time I had binoculars and with getting a closer look!  I was able to detect that they were not fireflies.  They seemed to maneuver like moths, in a rather erratic fashion.  But they did not have wings.  One of the objects which was about the size of a ping pong ball flew in a corkscrew maneuver within what seemed like an area of 2 feet or so.   All of the objects flew within an area of about 3 feet, I did not witness the objects flying away from the area in front of the chimney.  I wouldn't be surprised if the objects were to appear again.;38.9066060549607;-77.0252989753134
