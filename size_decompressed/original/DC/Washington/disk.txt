Roiling, red/orange disk traverses nation's capitol at supersonic speed, near White House...never reported (1974).;1974-06-06 20:30:00;two minutes;Roiling, red/orange disk traverses nation's capitol at supersonic speed, near White House...never reported (1974). We were on a third floor balcony of a building across the street from the Costa Rican embassy.  We first spotted the craft to the northwest, visible as what appeared to be a bright landing light of a jet liner down near/toward the Washington monument, slowly moving eastward.  This is when it first caught my attention, and I pointed it out to my friends, as it seemed oddly bright and large for an aircraft landing light.  It remained in this aspect for 15 - 20 seconds, when it suddenly seemed to veer into a south-east vector, with the apparence of coming toward us, passing slightly to the east of the White House.  At this point my friends and I became VERY interested, as what sort of aircraft would be permitted to operate so dramtically and closely to the presidential mansion?  The night was overcast, it was most likely a weeknight, possibly Thursday or Friday night.  As the object veered toward us, it began to cross the city at a very high rate of speed, faster than any fighter jet could traverse the city.  As it came closer and closer it presented a definite red/orange roiling disk, with no tail ot trail behind it, underneath the cloud deck.  Now we were very excited, and shocked, and some of us began to be terrified and a few hit the deck, thinking it might crash into us or crash into the low hills behind us.  As it passed east of us, somewhat overhead, it was presenting a pure disk (circular, perhaps it was spheroid).  I had the impression of a roaring sound, and yet, later, I realized that it had made no actual sound.  This was the most dramatic thing I've ever seen in the nighttime sky before or since, and I was fortunate enough to have see the meteorite that later crashed in Pennsylvania in 1965 as it flamed blue-white across the sky, through our family's picture window in St. Clair Shores, Michigan.  This was SUCH a dramatic nighttime display that I couldn't WAIT to hear the official explanation the next day......but there was no report of it in the papers, and when I called the local police station, the officer handling the phone had not heard a thing about it.  The lack of reporting of this aerial phenomena was actually more bizarre, even terrifying than the phenomena itself, for how could such an astounding display, traversing the entire nation's capitol, not be noticed by others, and reported, or at least SPECULATED upon.

Black motionless disk spotted in the evening above Washington, D.C.;1999-08-14 20:00:00;2 minutes;Black motionless disk spotted in the evening above Washington, D.C. Walking in Adams Morgan along busy sidewalk in the evening and looked up toward north, northeast about 70-80 degrees from the horizon black stationary disk motionless for approximately 2 minutes of viewing (partly cloudy around sunset).  Object appeared stationary and then disappeared apparently.  Had some sense of physical object unlike aircraft due to contrast with clearly definable clouds.

UFO appearing behind BBC correspondent on Breakfast News during US Election coverage (November 2000);2000-11-09 08:47:00;4 minutes;UFO appearing behind BBC correspondent on Breakfast News during US Election coverage (November 2000) This has actually been inadvertedly filmed by the BBC, and shown on their Breakfast News program during coverage of the US elections.  On the afforementioned date, the BBC switched their coverage to a Washington studio for a live interview with their Election Correspondent.  The time was approximately 08:47 (GMT).  The correspondent was seated in front of a window, through which a backdrop of night-time Washington was clearly visible.  As the interviewee was speaking, a UFO slowly 'drifted' in from the top left corner of the window and hung motionlessly for the rest of the interview.  I would describe the object as disc-shaped (as viewed as a near side-on angle) and was a soft blue colour.  I have e-mailed the BBC to see if they could identify the 'object' as a reflection, etc. but, as yet, they have not replied.  There were two observers to this incident - myself and a housemate.  I am currently a first year psychology PhD student, aged 27 and my housemate is a research fellow, having recently completed his PhD in the same subject.  We are both based at ((Name deleted)) University, although my reporting of this incident has no association whatsoever to the Department or the University.;38.9066060549607;-77.0252989753134

My sister mentioned that a lady in her office saw the UFO along with her husband while in their car in the Washington, D. C. area just before dusk on March 13th.  The lady indicated that she witnessed the UFO for approximately  eight seconds while her husband saw it for a longer time since he had difficulty getting his wife's attention.  She estimated the saucer to be about three city blocks in diameter and fairly close to the ground.  There was many flashing lights of different colors on the underside of the saucer.  I will try to get this lady in my sister's office to file her own report on this sighting since she knows much more about this sighting then I do.

U.F.O. Reported in Washington D.C.;2005-07-27 06:30:00;25 Minutes;U.F.O. Reported in Washington D.C. Awoken by my alarm clock I arose to see a peculiar shape in the window. It was flashing slightly (in multiple colors) and against the dark sky I could clearly make out it was a disk shape. I could easily tell it wasn't an airplane but some form of U.F.O. It seemed to hover in a single position for a few minutes then it dropped and remained stationary on the ground, held up by some form of retractable legs, for about ten minutes. The legs then retracted and the space ship rose vertically and then disappered almost immediately.  Following the landing of the ship a red station wagon sped directly from the road I presumed the U.F.O. had landed. The car was being driven very carelessly, well over the speed limit. Whatever the driver had seen it had caused him a great alarm and he wanted to get away quickly. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Daytime sighting of bright light changing to stationary white/blue gray annulus and then moved very fast.;2008-06-11 16:45:00;1.5 -3 min;Daytime sighting of bright light changing to stationary white/blue gray annulus and then moved very fast. Weather: Temperature (est) upper 80s/low 90s), humidity (dew point 60s), wind light, clear sky with patch of high level cirrus to north east.  Air craft contrails moderate to short with definite gaps in trail. Narrative: I was sitting on a lounge chair located in the patio shade attempting to read a novel as I played with my granddaughter and a neighborâ€™s child.  They were interested in how the chair could change positions as I relaxed so they were tilting me to and fro.  My grandson was off exploring around the corner of the house. I observed a contrail passing from North to South as an aircraft flew along the usual flight path to the west of Washington.  This contrail was short to moderate in length as it evaporated into the dry upper-level air.  The next aircraft observed along that path did not pass until after 1700 hours.  Length of contrails depends upon humidity level of the surrounding air and there were definite long gaps in these contrails. As I looked at the contrail and the aircraft started to disappear behind a nearby tree, my attention was drawn to a bright light very slightly above the contrail.  I assumed this light to be caused by the sun reflecting from another aircraft.  As I looked at the light source, its position in the sky relative to the contrail did not change.  Thus it could not have been caused by reflection from another aircraft. Nor could it have been caused by reflection from a satellite.  Both sources would have moved relative to the contrail. Shortly the apparent position relative to the still existing contrail changed from above to below the contrail.  Time for this change from the initial was estimated in the neighborhood of 30 to 60 seconds.  I noted that the light was now an object that appeared to be similar to a high flying balloon such as those used for upper air studies.  So my next guess at the cause of the bright light that I first noticed was a reflection from the instrument package.  Thus I arose from my lounge chair to call my grandchildren so that I could show them the balloon. The object now appeared against the blue sky background as a white/blue-gray annulus with a darker blue-gray center. It was much larger than the original light source.  Relative size can be compared to that of a pea (3-5 mm) held at armsâ€™ length.  From my viewing angle I assumed that it was a round object with a flat bottom since it appeared elliptical.  Color and shading was consistent with light shining through, not reflecting from, a high flying polyethylene balloon.  Brightness was similar to that of the moon which was in the eastern sky on that day.  The moon in the southern sky was hidden from my view by the roof of the home. I continued to view the object as it moved quite quickly for a short (relative) distance and stopped.  Upon this movement, I started to think that perhaps the object was much closer to me and that it could be some type of air borne seed (such as cottonwood) or debris moved about by low level winds swirling around the house.  Second thoughts occurred as I changed my position relative to nearby houses and trees.  This object had moved too fast for wind born insects, seeds or debris. As I continued to observe the object, it very suddenly accelerated and sped off eastward passing across my field of view from west to east behind the nearby rooftop in well under one second.  Total subtended angle of movement before moving out of my sight was in the 20 degree range.  No contrail or other evidence of its passing remained except the image in my minds eye. Altitude of this object cannot be estimated from this single observation since the size of this object is unknown.  Estimated angle above the horizon at first sighting is around 40 degrees.  The apparent standing still with respect to the contrail can be explained by the initial movement of the object directly toward me.  The object would have moved closer to me and toward the north as it descended below my reference contrail and become a recognizable shape.  From my viewing angle, the object was probably circular giving it somewhat of an elliptical cigar shape popularized by other UFO reports.  It moved too fast across my field of view to describe it better.  Total viewing time was 1.5 to 3 minutes.   This is estimated from my first sighting to my subsequent moving about to locate my grandchildren.  I certainly did not look at my watch during this event.
