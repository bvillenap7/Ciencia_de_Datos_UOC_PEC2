At first I thought it was a constellation (like Orion's belt), but it was moving in a worm-like wiggle formation toward the National Mall.  There appeared to be about 8-12 lights in a sequence and wiggled in a straight trajectory.  I grabbed my binoculars to get a better look, but by then, the light formation was fading from my view. I didn't see any type of shape or solid formation.  It was definitely within the atmosphere and it made no sound. I thought it being DC, it might be some experimental flying military craft, but the fact that it made no sound and wiggled made me suspicious. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no e-address.  We do not know whether this is intended to be a serious report.  PD));38.9066060549607;-77.0252989753134
a formation of dimly glowing objects...maybe birds?  Very odd.;2006-02-15 04:15:00;30 seconds;a formation of dimly glowing objects...maybe birds?  Very odd. I have been debating with myself whether to bother reporting this, and decided it looked odd enough to do it...I went out onto the balcony to have a cigarette early this morning, and first saw two dimly lit (yellowish-white) objects pass over me, heading south.  When I first saw them, I thought they might be military jets, and then that perhaps they were birds.  Anyway, after these two had passed, I noticed what at first looked like a string of similar dim lights, then appeared to be a loose V formation, I think a dozen or so lights, heading south-west.  The way they moved, I still think they could have been birds, night herons perhaps, that just looked like they were glowing because of the ambient light being amplified by snow on the ground.  The way they appeared to glow through the cloud cover, however, seemed odd to me.  Anyway, just thought I'd post this in case anyone else saw these lights and thought they looked unusual.;38.9066060549607;-77.0252989753134
8 orbs of light flew  directly over head in a formation before a synchronized deformation and dissapearance. Lone orb 5 min later.;2014-02-22 10:30:00;20 seconds;8 orbs of light flew  directly over head in a formation before a synchronized deformation and dissapearance. Lone orb 5 min later Myself and 6 other people were on a 9th floor rooftop in Washington D.C.'s Dupont Circle neighborhood at roughly 10:30 PM.  Something directly above me caught my eye.  I looked up to see 8 orbs of light flying silently in formation about 2000 yards up.  The orbs looked to resemble what we know as a plane.  Four orbs in a straight line with two orbs going out to each side and angled toward the back of the formation at the midway point of the 4 in-line orbs.  It was immediately evident that this was not a plane however as the clouds that were in the back ground (much higher in the sky) were clearly visible in the space between the orbs.  The orbs of light traveled in this formation for roughly 15 seconds going south to north.  At the 15 second mark the formation went through a synchronized “deformation scramble” into an amorphous unidentifiable jumble (still retaining their individual properties just no longer in a geometric formation of any kind).  The mass of unorga! nized orbs accelerated not over the horizon but directly following our horizontal site line.  The lights then vanished completely at a height I can only describe as three fingers above the horizon (holding my hand out a foot in front of my face) and roughly 5 miles away. Five minutes later someone facing the south (I was facing north) said, “Look another one.”  I again looked immediately up to see a single orb of light, flying at the same altitude and in the same direction as the previous 8 orbs.  This one had a more defined haze of light surrounding it and was lighter/whiter in color.  At around the same distance as the deformation described in the previous paragraph, the single orb began to move laterally from my view point no more than a 10-15 degree divergence from its northern flight path on either side.  Essentially it began to wiggle back and forth for 5 seconds as it continued its northern progression in the same direction as the previous 8.  The orb then disappeared in roughly the same spot as the ones prior.;38.9066060549607;-77.0252989753134
Multiple light formation seen at 9pm Friday, June 20th, over the Potomac river in VA, from tallest hill in Washington, DC.;2014-06-20 21:00:00;30 minutes;Multiple light formation seen at 9pm Friday, June 20th, over the Potomac river in VA, from tallest hill in Washington, DC. I live on the top of a big hill in DC that overlooks the Potomac river.  I was looking out my window towards the South East and over Virginia or the river, I saw a slow moving formation of lights.  Not unlike what I've seen of the Phoenix Lights.  I watched them for a little while 15-30 mins.  I took some photographs, which I will submit.   This view also encompasses the takeoff/landing path for Reagan National airport in Alexandria, VA, but I have been watching the planes come and go for a couple of years, and have never ever seen something like this.   The lights in the formation moved in inconsistent ways.  Some moving up and down some left (south) some right (north).  I went out to the street and could see them there as well.  I went in to get something to eat and when I returned they were gone.   Also to note, the lights were orange, not yellow or white.  I did see aircraft take off from the airport while the event was occurring and it appears the the lights were further off than the aircraft.;38.9066060549607;-77.0252989753134
