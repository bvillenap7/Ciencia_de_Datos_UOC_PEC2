White light over Potomac river.  ((Venus??));2020-03-15 22:20:00;15 minutes;White light over Potomac river I was driving down 340 toward the Virginia line, a bridge crosses the Potomac river.  A bright white light seems to be hovering just over the ridge line about 500-1000 feet.  There where no other lights then white, it didnâ€™t seem to move as I got closer. I  lost site, behind some trees, as I got close to the mountain ridge it was over.  It appeared to be over top of the river and not the ridge like I initially believed.;39.3086;-77.6278
