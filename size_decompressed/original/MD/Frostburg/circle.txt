Parked in front of my house, got out of car and faced east where the sun rises and seen two very large craft.  Glowing a vibrant orange and each having 4 lights facing us at all times in a diamond shape on the craft. If the lights where a compass east and west would red lights while south and north would be white lights.   All of our phones where dead so I got my neighbor to come out with her phone and record it.  We have about a two minute video of this.  The lights where mesmerizing and seemed to be blinking in a counter clockwise rotation.  As the original two moved left and right up and down in a fashion that is impossible of any known technology or aircraft known to man, they where completely silent, as the two headed due south and left the atmosphere with a small flash they rendered on the same path the took the first time only this time a third caught up with them from the same path about 4 to 5 seconds behind them.   As they entered the atmosphere and where further away, they actually appeared larger than when they got close, maybe from the heat and extreme tempature of the air around the craft as it entered the atmosphere they all three eventually met up in a reverse delta formation and left the atmosphere.   At same time directly under them I witnessed what seemed to be an orb comeout of a house and shoot into the street light. I have video of this from a cell phone.   All this happened in the course of about 4 mins.;39.6498;-78.9357
