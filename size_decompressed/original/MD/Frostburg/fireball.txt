Strange blue-green ball of light seen on I68;2012-04-10 22:30:00;seconds;Strange blue-green ball of light seen on I68 I was by myself driving down I-68E from Frostburg, and I was going over the Clarysville bridge, when I saw this ball of light fly through the sky. It's almost hard to describe because it was this blue-greenish color that I've never seen before and it was almost like the ball was pulsating to different colors. The speed of it was just incredible. It was only in my field of vision of the sky for about 10 seconds before it had completely crossed the sky, but it looked as though it was arcing across the sky, but then in the middle of the sky it looked like it almost - I honestly can't even think of a word to describe how it moved but the closest I can come up with is it instantaneously moved moved about an inch higher. I had pulled off to the side of the road because I was in wonder about what I had just seen because in all the years I've been looking at the night sky, I've never seen anything like it. I've seen comets and meteors falling, as well as I'm an amat! eur astronomer so I know what a tail to a comet or meteor would look like.
