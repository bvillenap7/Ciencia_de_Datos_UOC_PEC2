I saw two objects that were moving in a clockwise rotation, about two hundred feet above the trees.  The object would stop every two minutes or so and flash red light between the two objects, then the larger of the two object would flash a green then blue light towards the ground.  The objects were hovering or flying above a farm. After about twenty minutes the object then departed they were spun off, like someone had a rock tied to the end of a rope and then let go of the rope, they left in a high rate of speed.  I am in my mid-twenties and life long skeptic of para-normal pheonomenia, currently attaining degree in chemistry and work for major telecommunications company.;39.6498;-78.9357
