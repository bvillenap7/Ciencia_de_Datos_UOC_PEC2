A clear starry night, no clouds and I think moonless.I looked to west then I saw a shooting star.   As I looked back to the north I saw what appeared to be 5 rectangular lights about 600 to 700 hundred ft. above me.  They were flying in a V formation.  ((I am an ex Airborne Ranger and not excitable.)) They flew in unison, made a tight turn to the south.   This area is under commercial flight paths and jets can be heard many miles away at 35,000 ft.   They did not make any noise, and were flying at a very low rate of speed. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) The objects appeared slightly smaller than the moon. They were light yellow in appearance and moved in perfect unison, as if this  were a single craft. I`m not saying it was alien in nature but, DAMN IT WAS STRANGE!!! ((END ADDENDUM)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));39.6498;-78.9357
