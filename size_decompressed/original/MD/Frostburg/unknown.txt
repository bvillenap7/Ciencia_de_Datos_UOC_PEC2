My daughter noticed a light in the sky, at first it was still then it started moving extremely fast.  Once we were on interstate 68E. the object was above and to the left of our car then was above and in front of us and came down closer. Remember white, red and blue lights.  Then another object with the same kind of lights was in the sky to the right side of our vehicle and headed right toward the first object.  They went so close to each other, i thought they were gonna crash into each other right in front of us.  Then the second object shot backwards from us, headed west and was so fast it was out of sight in seconds.  The first object continued heading east toward cumberland.  I got a call from my oldest daughter who just got off work in Lavale, Md. She was freaking out like something happened to her.  Her car stalled in the middle of a main intersection in LaVale. We were seeing this strange object while i was on the phone with her and i was telling her that we just seen 2 ufo's.  As we got off our exit for LaVale to go get her the first object continued toward Cumberland. We seen this from Frostburg to LaVale.;39.6498;-78.9357
