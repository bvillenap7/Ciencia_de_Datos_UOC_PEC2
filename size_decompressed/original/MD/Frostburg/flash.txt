I could hear a loud bell, almost like a Christmas bell, continuously ringing.  It got louder as I walked through campus.  I noticed that nobody was around.  It was so loud that I had to use my hands and cover my ears.  I could see a woman running in the distance, so I approached her and asked, “what is that sound?”  She said “What sound?” and when she said that, I saw a bright flash go across the sky and the sound stopped.  I said “never mind”.  It was incredibly weird. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
