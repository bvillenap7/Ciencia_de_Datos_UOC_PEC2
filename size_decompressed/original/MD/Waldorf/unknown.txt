Me and my boyfriend were awaken from dead sleep by very loud airplane noises that sounded way too close/ or loud...we thought we were about to be attacked (because of 9-11) or we were at war.  It was so loud, but then it went away like it was never there and I went back to sleep.  I had forgotten all about it until I saw the 10pm news on Fox 5 and there was a UFO siting in Waldorf, were we live!  They mentioned two F-19 (sic.  F-16) fighter jets being deployed to possibly identify the reports comming in but they found nothing.  We must have heard the jets going over our house, or maybe the actual UFO.;38.6213530769231;-76.9425776923075
