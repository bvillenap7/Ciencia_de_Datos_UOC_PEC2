Off in the distance I saw an object moving in a very strange way. It was moving up then down very fast then it would move to the left then the right.I had never seen any of our aircrafts shaped like this or move like this. I watched it for about 5 minutes, it was still there when I proceeded to go on to my mothers.She lived about a mile away.She came out and got in the car, we proceeded to go to the store.I backed out and went to the stop sign by her house and there was the object up close now flying very slow over the buildings and trees.The object was very large about the size of a football field, it was mettallic in color, it made no sound, it had no windows or lights, it was between being oval shaped and mushroom shaped.This craft flew so slow it was almost hovering. Now the strangest thing about this! object is coming from the bottom center it had a black tube looking object coming from it about half the size of the craft.Now while I watched this craft I had the strange feeling that it was hunting for something. I watched it until it went out of sight, or as if it blended into the enviroment.I will always remember that day, it will always be very clear in my mind.And then the very next night I went over again to take my mother to the store, we go to the stop sign again, it is around 1000 pm and there flying at an average speed was many bright white lights flying scattered all over the sky making no sound. When we got home we were watching the news and the castors were talking about the strange lights flying over Andrews Airforce base, and making jokes about them being ufos flying over the base. Now when I saw this craft it was around 1100 am in the daytime on a gray cloudless day, there were no leaves on the trees,and I saw this craft up close, and I watched it for at! least 1000minutes. I just want this on record somewhere what! I saw t hat day. I sure will never forget it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD));38.6213530769231;-76.9425776923075

None of the 5 persons present during the actual photographing remember seeing the object.  It was not known untill the film was developed a few days later. Myself and a group of friends were shooting off model rockets in the parking lot of West Lake High School here in Waldorf Maryland around 17:00 Easter Sunday 1998.  I snapped this photo of my nextdoor neighbor prepairing another rocket for launch, and when the photo came back from CVS, the object in the upper right hand courner was present.  It appears to be roughly oval in shape with what might be a triangular construction on top.  The triangular region seems to be highly reflective, while the lower oval portion of the overall object is dark and featureless. I have ruled out the possibility of lens contamination, it only appears on the one frame, and there were no rockets in the air at the time, and no other persons in the area.  Noone from the group remembers seeing anything, and we were all suprised by the photo.;38.6213530769231;-76.9425776923075

On closer examination, the object was either revolving with a single light or there was a row of lights flashing in sequence. While driving north on rt 5 in Waldorf, on the left, I noticed out of the coner of my eye a single light that caught my attention.  I started to slow down and noticed that there appeared to be more lights that were flashing in sequence from right to left.   I then looked closer at it and could only see half of what to appeared to be round. I saw also a faint u-shaped bottom to a solid object.    After I looked more closly at the object the lights sped up the sequence in which they had started with.  The lights had sped up so much that it became one continuous blur of lights, all lights were bright white.  The number of lights I saw was 6.   After what seemed to be a lifetime, but was only about a minute, this object was gone.  No sign of anything ever being there, nothing.  I didn't hear anything nor did I see anything that might have been there.   At arm's length the object was about 2 inches and about at angle of 11 o'clock.   I am a white female,age 22, 2 years college, and am working in retail right now.;38.6213530769231;-76.9425776923075
