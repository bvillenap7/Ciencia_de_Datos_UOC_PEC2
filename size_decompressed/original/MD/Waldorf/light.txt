Three circular lights fuse into one and become an intensly bright beacon;1997-10-15 21:30:00;7 minutes;Three circular lights fuse into one and become an intensly bright beacon Had I known about this site being available back seven years ago, I would have reported it to you all, but I did contact the local sheriffs who responded out to my house, but I don't believe they took a report.  I am a Federal Police officer and I worked downtown in Washington, D.C. I decided to take off early that Friday night due to boredom when I arrived home at around 2115 hours.  All the lights were off in my house but my husband and eleven year old daughter were in the family room watching TV.  My husband (now ex-husband) went to take a shower while my daughter and I remained in the family room watching the TV. I decided to make hot chocolate for her and coffee for me in our kitchen which was dimly illuminated by the under range top light, when I heard my daughter tell me in a very startled voice, Mommy, come look at the lights!  I told her to hold on a minute while I finished making our drinks, but her voice became even more desperate almost pleading with me to come look at the lights, and finally she started crying and almost in a state of panic, look at the lights!  I thought she had turned the lights on in the family room because my kitchen lit up as if every light were on.  I turned around and couldn't believe my eyes when I realized how brightly lit our family room was.  It was a very warm October night, about 68 degrees outside, so we had a few of our windows open, including my sliding glass door in the kitchen which leads to the backyard where my dog Cleo was.  Cleo is a black lab, doberman, dalmation mix, who weighs about 95 lbs. I told her to wait inside while I went outside to see who or what was in my driveway.  As I walked outside, I noticed three circular lights at about tree level across the street at my neighbors house.  The tree was about 35 feet in height and the neighbors house was only about 20 feet high.  In relationship to my house and my driveway, the circular lights were approximately 75 feet from me and were intensely bright.  The circles of light were lined up horizontally and about 35 feet off of the ground.  The circle in the middle was large and appeared to be five feet or so wide, the smaller lights on each side appeared to be two to three feet wide and all three ligths were a combination of amber, cream and white.  A color that I have never seen before or since.  The lights gave off or emitted heat and there was a humming noise in the air.  When I walked out further to try and see what these lights were and where they were coming from, they moved quickly from horizontal to vertical, with the largest light still in the middle.  The larger light seemed to be gyrating or oscillating and the lights appeared to be moving closer to me in which the lights became even more intensely bright, almost blinding me and there was heat being emitted.  I didn't realize that my little girl had ran outside the door after me, so when I realized the lights were coming closer, and now I placed them at about 30 feet away from me the lights appeared to be like a beacon almost with a circular shape and almost to where you couldn't tell where one circle was from the other -- like they fused together.  I turned around and ran inside, not realizing my child was outside crying, I ran back out to get her and I got her inside when my dog and other neighborhood dogs started growling and howling and acting almost as if she were spooked or rabid, she busted through the screen door and began barking and snarling at the front door.  At that point I ran into the bathroom and pullled my husband from the shower with my hysterics about what my daughter and I were seeing outside.  By the time my husband got the soap out of his eyes and a towel on him, we ran out to the front yard where the object still was brightly illuminated in our driveway, when the lights separated into three discs and sped off at at a rate of speed that most conventional airplanes could do and at what appeared to be a 45 degree angle.  You could see a vapor trail of where they left because it was partly cloudy with the moon behind my house which is located in a southwesterly direction.  When the police arrived, some of my neighbors came out to ask me if I had seen or heard anything because their dogs were going nuts and my daughter and I explained what we had seen.  But my daughter saw it first so I have no idea of where they came from or how they descended to tree level.  I think the sheriff's deputy thought my child and I were crazy, but my ex-husband who really didn't get a good look at anything too much agreed that my child and I definitely saw something, particularly convincing was the fact that our dog busted through our screen door and didn't calm down until ten minutes after the lights disappeared.

A bright green fast moving light.;2000-12-15 05:30:00;10 seconds;A bright green fast moving light. The incident happened about 2 months ago on my way to work at about 5:30 AM. It was a very clear morning. From the passenger side of the car flying extremely fast came a bright green light or ball with along tail on it. It was not all that high from the ground and was flying parrallel with the ground. It just flat out flew out of site. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));38.6213530769231;-76.9425776923075

Bright orange light seen in daytime sighting by UFO investigator while travelling.;2003-08-06 08:27:00;8 seconds;Bright orange light seen in daytime sighting by UFO investigator while travelling. I was in a vehicle, stopped on Highway #301 amidst work traffic heading south in Waldorf, MD. Wednesday morning, August 6, 2003.  Time was 08:27:30.  The sky consisted of unbroken gray cloud cover approximately 200 feet thick with its base at approximately 400 feet altitude.  Directly above the highway in my line of site at approximately 10 degrees elevation, a small but very bright orange light came shooting out of the cloud base approximately 1600 feet away from me.  The object's trajectory out of the cloud base was horizontal at first but immediately curved sharply downward--directly toward the ground below.  The object continued to burn steady until it passed 100 feet altitude at which time it faded out within a full second and visually ceased to exist.  Estimated speed was approximately 50 feet per second.  I was facing SW.  The object travelled at first from my right going to my left (NW to SE) before diving.  Object appeared star-like similar to Planet Venus in image size and intensity with no noticable form.  If the sighting had occurred at night, the brightness could rival a welder's torch.  Size of object was likely only a couple feet diameter.  Size and distance range was determined by using estimated altitude of cloud ceiling and elevation of object at point of exit from the cloud base.  Object was very close to intersection of Hwy. #301 and Rt. #228 in downtown Waldorf.  There were at least 200 cars between me and that intersection.  There were at least as many cars behind me, as well.  Sighting was brief and unexpected.  No one was seen stopping and getting out of their cars.  Object looked generally like a flare from a flare gun but appeared to have controlled flight, in my opinion.  I am an independant UFO investigator with many sightings to my credit and have personally determined this to be a true unknown.;38.6213530769231;-76.9425776923075

I saw it in Smallwood Drive as I walked home towards Middletown Rd.  I was near the Hampshire Housing track when I saw it at about the 10 o'clock position.;38.6213530769231;-76.9425776923075
Bright light in sky hovering and then moved very very rapidly.;2014-10-02 19:30:00;15 seconds;Bright light in sky hovering and then moved very, very rapidly. I was sitting in my truck at my son's football practice talking on the phone and noticed a ball of light in the sky. I thought it was a star until it zipped away really fast.  It was like it was hovering and then it moved a little, stopped and then zoomed off.  It was really really fast when it moved.  Too fast for anything man made i think.  It was a bright light.  If I didnt see it move i would probably never had noticed it cause it definatly looked like a star in the sky.;38.6213530769231;-76.9425776923075

It continued to hover in the same location for 10 min or so.  It then moved drastically to the right, then straight up.   The object disappeared a couple times the reappeared.  Movement was not of a airplane/ helicopter.  After 35-40 minutes, it flew toward my direction at a lower altitude.  I saw 3 lights at that point lined up in a row the white being the largest on far left side, middle light slightly smaller & less bright a light translucent baby blue, a light pinkish red light the same size as the blue one.   Object flew over my house to the other side.  It hovered over a field next to Hwy. 228.  Then it came back to the original side and repeated the same movement.;38.6213530769231;-76.9425776923075
