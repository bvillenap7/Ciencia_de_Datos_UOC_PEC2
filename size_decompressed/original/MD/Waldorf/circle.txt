A  U.F.O. was obseved being chased by f-16's in Waldorf, MD, which is located 20 miles from Wash D.C.;2002-07-26 01:30:00;20 minutes;A  U.F.O. was obseved being chased by f-16's in Waldorf, MD, which is located 20 miles from Wash D.C. on 7-26-02, I heard jets take off from andrews air force base around 1:15 a.m.. About 5 minutes later the jets were in over my area, sounding as if they were flying at low altitude.  I went outside and saw a fixed wing military aircraft using its full afterburner and traveling at a s.e. heading. Thr jet left the area at a high rate of speed and quickley left the area. I went back inside perplexed as for a explanation regarding these unusal flight manauvers at this time of night,  AT this point I heard more jets in the distance and went back outside and coming from the north I see this strange blueish orb traveling at about the same speed if you could compare to a shooting star.   I say it was about at 5000 feet when I first saw this and within  a second it desended to about 3000 feet in about 1 second.  It went right over my house making absolutley no noise whatsoever,  at this point a f-16 has come on to the flight path of the object on a S.E. heading about 1000 to 2000 feet behind it clearly in a pursuit mode and unable to vector the object.  I followed the pursuit as long as I could until I lost sight of the crafts.  A neighbor who was outside smoking a cigar also wittnessed the pursuit.   The object from start to finished stayed on a horizontal heading traveling from N TO s.e. ((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken at length with this witness to the July 26 event over Waldorf, MD, and find him to be quite credible.  He is scheduled to be a guest on the Jeff Rense Radio Program (<www.rense.com>) on Tuesday night, September 10, 2002.  The program will be archived.  PD));38.6213530769231;-76.9425776923075
Very hard to explain, the movement, the actions, and the speed...very wierd.;2008-01-02 22:35:00;10 mins (approx.);Very hard to explain, the movement, the actions, and the speed...very wierd. Before I explain..or try to explain what I view in the Stary Night skies over Waldorf, I never thought about UFO's or Aliens,etc.  But, on this night I witness something I just can not explain.  I saw two seperate groups of some type of wierd form of flying machine. I thought wow I wonder who they are looking for...But then I notice..it was'nt doing anything but,sitting in place..FOR A LONG TIME!.Suddenly like from a movie, another beam of light comes out of the cloud as if it was already there. As I was bugging out about what I was witnessing. I look further in the sky, and saw one very small cirlce object, with different color lights, blinking in a diamond like formation. It seem to either be small or very far, but the light did'nt resemble anything I ever saw before, and being near a base you tend to be able to reconize every time of plane that flies over your house. Alot more happen, but I believe what I told you is more then enough...;38.6213530769231;-76.9425776923075
3 white lights hovering over my neighborhood then started to land.;2014-10-12 02:30:00;3 hours;3 white lights hovering over my neighborhood then started to land. On October 12, 2014, I was up late at night sitting on my steps in front of my house.  I witnessed a small object with lights all around it hovering over my neighborhood. Initially I thought it was a plane, however the aircraft was moving too slowly to be an airplane.  I then noticed the object coming closer to the ground.  I immediately became frightened because I was the only one outside in my neighborhood because how late it was. I went inside the house and heard the dog barking across the street and it would not stop barking.  I then got scared that maybe the object saw me so I turned off my lights in my room and went under the blanket.  Thirty minutes later I was touched one time and became dizzy and saw lights shining in my eyes through my blanket.  I believe the extraterrestrial is invisible to the human eye but not invisible in general. I was so scared I didnt move hoping it would leave.  I then went into a sleep still feeling dizzy.  I believe the ext! raterrestrial was touching me making me feel dizzy in hopes I would forget however when I woke up I still remembered everything that happened. Unfortunately the extraterrestrial has been coming every night for the last few nights doing the same activity.  Shining a light in my eyes, touched me one time and shocked me, and making me dizzy. I am not sure what the extraterrestrial wants or why.  I believe it wants me to forget the situation however it frightens me so much its impossible to forget.  On the last encounter the extraterrestrial dropped something in my ear.  I am reporting this to every internet site or agency I can in hopes the extraterrestrial(s) leave me and my family alone.
