Hovering cigar shaped object.;2007-05-06 12:30:00;5 min;Hovering cigar shaped object. I was driving to work on Sunday 5/6/07 at 12:30 PM.  I was on the back road between Prince Frederick and Waldorf Maryland.  As I entered a new road (Cederville) I saw what appeared to be an airplane coming in for a landing just above the tree tops. (This is what my mind first said it was.)  As I drove towards it I noticed that it was not moving in any way, not forward or backward or even away or closer to me.  At this point I pull off of the road and shut off my trucks engine.  My windows were open and I could hear no sound of engines at all.  I sat there looking at this UFO and could not make sense of what I was seeing. I reached for the phone and called my friend and was talking to his wife about it.  As I looked at the object closely I could not see any wings and it looked like a cigar shaped sliver metal fuselage.  I could even see some detail on the surface.  I could see the sun sunning on the surface of the silver metal.  It had a darker area at one end that was a little larger then the rest of the lines of the craft. The object was about 1 Â½ inches long if the ruler was held at arms length.  As I was talking to my friend wife the object started to move off to the North very slowly and started to come lower and lower.  It went below the tree level but I still could see it on and off as it passed throw the trees.  This is one gage as to how far away the object was.  I would say that it was not very far into the tree line because of this. After I drove around to the other side of the tree line and found nothing.  There are fields on ether side of this tree stand.  I drove next to a church that is in sight of the fields and asked if there is any airfield close to there.  I was told there was none.  I was traveling northwest and the object was seen south of Washington DC. in the Maryland county of Charales.;38.6213530769231;-76.9425776923075
cigar object floating in air very clear;2007-08-18 07:15:00;15 sec;cigar object floating in air very clear We were eating breakfast on the back deck and all noticed a almost submarine like cigar shaped floating object glideing in almost a diagonal line across the sky it made no noise or left any trace and had no wings or propelers. It was very close to the ground and just a little bit over top of the trees. It was amazing. And crazy.;38.6213530769231;-76.9425776923075
