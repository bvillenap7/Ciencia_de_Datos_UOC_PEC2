Disk-shaped object with sequentially-flashing green lights around the perimeter -- 5/73 -- flying low.;1973-05-01 09:00:00;3-4 minutes;Disk-shaped object with sequentially-flashing green lights around the perimeter -- 5/73 -- flying low. Note: I have entered this before -- but in July 1973 by mistake.  It was in the SPRING. ..  I was entering Rt. 70S from Fields Road (70S is now 270).  The ramp dumps you onto the road about 50 feet before you go under the Shady Grove Road underpass.   Just as I was heading under I noticed something round up in the sky.  As I emerged from the underpass I was already looking up to see if I could see the object.  At first I couldn't and I wondered if it had changed direction, when all of a sudden it came into view, not high, but at a much lower altitude than at first.  It was crossing the highway in front of my car going roughly from NW to SE.  I think it was flying too low for legal airspace.  At that point, since I was almost under it, it looked just like a big black disk, but a second or two later it got far enough away to see the edge of it -- which was a band of sequentially-flashing green lights.  That's when I knew this wasn't anything ordinary.   It continued in the SE direction -- I sped up to about 90 MPH because it was the only thing I could do to see more, but I couldn't keep up ... I think it must have been traveling 300-400 mph.   I watched the object go into the distance and noticed that it kept descending, so that eventually I was looking straight out at it.  My location on Rt. 70S was high ground, and in 1973 there wasn't much built up along it, so there was a pretty clear view of this object.   After awhile it was so far that I couldn't even make out the flashing lights anymore.  It began to veer slightly toward the east. ....  The next morning, in almost the exact spot, WPGC announced that the Air Force said that the object reported by some observers the day before was 'an experimental airplane with sequentially flashing lights.'  The announcement did not include anything about the fact that this object had no wings of the type our aircraft usually has. ...  The sighting occurred about 9 a.m. over a highway that in those days wasn't as busy as it is in 2005, but there was other traffic besides myself.   I'll never forget this and am still hoping to find someone else who saw it and did the research to find out what it is.   Since the radio announcement said the Air Force made the statement, and the object did kind of veer off toward Andrews AFB, I never talked about it for 28 years.  (I can draw a sketch of what I saw if I could talk to a researcher.) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));39.1366513513514;-77.2180229729731
Black round obj  with seq flashing green lights, 6-8 in wide viewed at arm's length, and seen in daylight -- and no wings!;1973-07-01 08:00:00;30 seconds~;Black round obj  with seq flashing green lights, 6-8 in wide viewed at arm's length, and seen in daylight -- and no wings! I know this is an old sighting, but I've never reported it before and have to get it off my chest!  ... I was driving south on Rt. 70S (now Rt. 270) and had just gone under the Shady Grove Road overpass.  The day was gloomy, almost like a foggy-rainy day but it was not raining the clouds just seemed to be very low.  As I came out from the underpass, I saw this big thing above me.  It had no wings that I could determine and I tried hard to speed up to keep getting a better look.  I probably got up to about 80, but it was no contest.  It was black (I could only see the underside at first), and at arm's length I would say it was about 6-8 inches in diameter, a real big-un as they say. As it continued south in front of me and drew away, I could see that it had green sequentially flashing lights along the rear (but I could not, of course, see whether these lights went all around the object).  It then slowly changed course toward the East and I lost sight of it because I had to drive.  I think the object was going about 300-400 mph -- it reminded me of the way a C130 had looked the day a friend said, It isn't going that slow, it is just that big.  I let it go out of my mind, but the next morning I heard on the radio that the Air Force had reported that the object seen by a number of people was an experimental plane they were testing.  It did seem to me that something that size would have had a budget that people would be arguing about.  If it was a secret, why were they testing it in broad daylight?  And, most of all, why didn't it have any wings?  I would love to hear from anyone else who has seen something similar.;39.1366513513514;-77.2180229729731
