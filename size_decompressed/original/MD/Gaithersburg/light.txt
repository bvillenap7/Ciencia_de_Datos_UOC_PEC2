3 UFOs in sky, 2 fighter jets, Gaithersburg, Maryland;2005-08-29 00:25:00;three minutes;3 UFOs in sky, 2 fighter jets, Gaithersburg, Maryland I was on my deck smoking a cigar with my father.  There are usually planes flying in and out of my area going to Dulles, BWI, etc., so seeing air traffic is usual.   However, I saw a bright light illuminate as high as the planes were.  First suspicion was that it was a satellite, or a helicopter.  It was neither unfortunately.  The starshaped light (had vertexes like a star) starting moving to the left very slowly, and then blue and red lights started blinking that were much smaller than the yellowish light, not in unison.   Then the light moved up, and fast to the left and stopped, then went up a little, and then the light transformed into a small ball of light that was not as bright, the blue and red lights stopped, and then it disapeared.  Immediatly following this another starshaped light moved into the scene, and did almost the same movements, but then we saw two objects that looked like planes (because of the lights planes give off) move EXTREMELY fast parallel under the starshaped light and keep on flying past. Possibly fighter jets sent out to investigate or scare off the crafts?  As this was happening we saw no commercial planes, just the lights, and the fighter jets which only went by the scene once.  Then, the startshaped light number 2 disapeared, and for another minute nothing was going on  then to the far right of the sky another light started, moved to the left, and then went into a ball of light, but not as small as the previous two, and emited a blue misty/cloudy/lightning type string in the sky. The final light went left like the others, stopped, and then vanished but without turning into a ball of light. After this I was shocked, frightened, and positive that these were ufos, and i'm very glad to see that figher jets were sent to make them go away.;39.1366513513514;-77.2180229729731

I WAS USING THE RESTROOM AND HEARD WHAT SOUNDED LIKE AN AIRPLANE FLYING OVER. SO I JUST DECIDED TO GLANCE THROUGH THE BLINDS OF THE WINDOW TO TAKE A LOOK IN THE DIRECTION THAT I HEARD IT GOING IN. I DID NOT EXPECT TO SEE ANYTHING, BUT I SAW WHAT I THOUGHT WAS AN AIRPLANE, GOING NORTHWEST, THEN IT JUST DISAPPEARD! I IMMEDIATELY OPENED THE BATHROOM WINDOW TO GLANCE OUTSIDE TO SEE IF I HAD MISSED ANYTHING. I STOOD STILL FOR QUITE A WHILE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT HAD JUST HAPPENED. I DECIDED TO GO UP STAIRS AND WENT INTO MY SISTERS ROOM AND ASKED HER IF SHE HAD HEARD ANYTHING. SHE SAID THAT SHE HAD JUST HEARD AN AIRPLANE GOING BY. ALL THIS TOOK PLACE WITH IN A PERIOD OF ABOUT 4-5 MINUTES. THE SIGHTING OF THE, WHATEVER IT WAS, TOOK PLACE OVER ABOUT 5-10 SECONDS.
