Shimmering object in northern sky of Montgomery County Maryland;2011-10-08 21:00:00;1 hour;Shimmering object in northern sky of Montgomery County Maryland   For about a month a strange spherical craft hovers in the northern sky.  It will sit still for about 30 minutes to an hour then move north.  At first I thought maybe it was a star but then it moved north at a slow rate of speed.  It could possibly be a helicopter but for it to hover for so long seems odd.  There are no flashing lights like an aircraft but it shimmers and it looks like a spinning top.  It appears as if it is watching Dulles airport in Virgina as we are in the flight path of planes taking off.;39.1366513513514;-77.2180229729731
