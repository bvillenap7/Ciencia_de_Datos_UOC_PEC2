Summer of 1977 I saw a large oval black object hovering just over the tree tops going very slowly.;1977-06-15 21:00:00;15 minutes;Summer of 1977 I saw a large oval black object hovering just over the tree tops going very slowly. In the summer of 1977 as I walked back towards my home from the park in our neighborhood, in a small housing development, I noticed a very large but quiet UFO hovering over the tree tops.  The object captivated me.  I could not take my eyes off it.   Instead of going home, I followed the UFO as it moved slowly across the tree tops in the wooded area that surrounded the development.  I followed the UFO, for approximately 15 minutes, to Quince Orchard Road, and it continued straight into the woods across the road.  (At the time that area was all wooded).  I could not follow it any further. The UFO looked oval/dome shaped.  It was very large.  It was dark colored like gray/black.  It had windows along the top dome section.   Not all windows where lit, but there was some light coming from some of the windows. It traveled very slowly, because as I followed it, it stayed ahead of me but I didn’t lose sight of it until it went into another wooded area where there was no road. I wanted to see if I could continue to follow this thing, so I caught a ride with a car that came along just after losing sight of the UFO- the fellow that stopped to give me a ride said he saw something.  I jumped in and told him I had seen it too, that I had been following it from Quince Orchard development.   He drove a little further to the little shopping center at the end of Quince Orchard Rd. but it was gone. I don’t know who that fellow was or if he ever reported the sighting.  But I never said anything to anyone about it until I had been married for awhile.  I told my husband and my four children. I wonder if the occurrence seen in approx June of 1977 was the same sighting I saw!   I think the UFO came from what is now the Seneca Park area.

LOW FLYING BLACK OVAL OBJECT WITH GREEN LIGHTS SEEN FLYING BY THE 270S EXIT OFF OF SHADY GROVE RD. IN GAITHERSBURG MARYLAND.;1999-04-15 23:45:00;20 seconds;LOW FLYING BLACK OVAL OBJECT WITH GREEN LIGHTS SEEN FLYING BY THE 270S EXIT OFF OF SHADY GROVE RD. IN GAITHERSBURG MARYLAND. I WAS DRIVING ON SHADY GROVE RD.  AT ABOUT 11:45 PM. THE SKY WAS FOGGY AND LIGHT RAIN WAS BEGININNG TO FALL. AS I WAS ABOUT TO EXIT UNTO 270S I SAW, ( & THE PERSON SITTING IN THE PASSENGER SEAT BESIDE ME), AN OVAL BLACK OVAL OBJECT (ABOUT 10FT WIDE) WITH GREEN LIGHTS UNDERNEATH IT FLY PAST AND ABOVE OUR CAR, APPROX. 30FT ABOVE US, AND 15FT IN FRONT OF US.  IT SEEMED TO BE CRUISING AT ABOUT 40MPH, BUT AS SOON AS IT GOT IN FRONT OF US (30FT ABOVE, 15 FT IN FRONT) IT EITHER DISAPPEARED OR FLEW SO FAST THAT WE COULD NOT TRACE ITS PATH ANY LONGER.  THE TIME LAPSE WAS APPROX. 20 SECONDS.  I REMEMBER WHEN IT BECAME VISIBLE TO ME (WHEN I SAW IT CRUISE ABOVE US ) I WAS IN DISBELIEF, AND AS I BEGAN TO ASK THE PASSENGER SITTING BESIDE ME IF HE SAW IT TOO,  HE AGREED WITH WHAT I HAD SEEN.  I ASKED HIM TO DESCRIBE TO ME WHAT HE SAW, AND HIS DESCRIPTION MATCHED MY VERY OWN VISUAL RECOLLECTION OF THE OBJECT.  WHAT WAS SO SURPRISNG ABOUT THE THE OBJECT WAS THAT IT WAS FLYING SO LOW, YET IT MADE NO NOISE,  AND THEN SUDDENLY IT EITHER TOOK OFF VERY FAST ( AND QUIETLY) OR JUST SEEM TO DISAPPEAR.

Bright object at edge of moon sat still, then moved slowly away from moon.;2003-07-08 20:31:00;6 minutes;Bright object at edge of moon sat still, then moved slowly away from moon. I am an amateur astronomer. My wife spotted an object she thought was a planet very close to the moon. I walked outside and she asked me to look at the planet next to the moon. It was early twilight. I looked and saw what appeared to be a star or planet just at the edge of the moon. It was apparently just at the edge of the moon on the dark side of a 3/4 full moon. I watched it for maybe 30 seconds and during this time it did not move at all in relation to the moon. I was going through my mind to try and figure what planet it might be, but none came to mind that would be in that part of the sky. All of a sudden the object started moving in a direction which from my perspective was toward 2 O'clock in relation to the moon. It moved much to slowly to be a satellite. It was not possible to tell if it moved in front of or behind the moon as it passed the top 1/5 of the moon. In 5 minutes it moved a little more than the width of a hand at arms length. The whole time the brightness of the object was about what the star Sirius would appear like at that time of day and it did not waver. My wife went in and got a pair of 12x50 binoculars about 2 minutes into this sighting, in the binoculars the object was no more visible than it was without them. Then as we were talking about it the object at some point disappeared, but no one actually saw it when it did finally disappeared. I did manage one digital photograph of the object with my Olympus 5 megapixel C-5050, I am sending it to you although it does not look like much. The photo shows both the object and the moon.  We can only figure it was one of two things. A balloon which very coincidentally did an apparent hover right at the point that it was resting on the very edge of the moon on the dark side and then proceeded to apparently move on and finally dissapear. The other is that it was a huge spacecraft near the moon which decided to leave while we were looking. It was certainly not a star, planet, or satellite, and it was not an airplane or jet or space shuttle. If this was a spacecraft near the moon you most certainly will have other reports of it, as it was difficult to miss.;39.1366513513514;-77.2180229729731
