I was driving out of my street and I looked up at the moon, I saw three rectangular objects next to the moon. They were there for about 2-3 minutes. They were in yellow color (solid color and non-flashing). When I stoped about 2-3 minutes later, there was nothing next or near the moon. ((NUFORC Note:  We received a seemingly credible report from Bealeson, VA, for an alleged sighting at close range for the same night.  Please see that report.
