Nine unidentified flying objects in the night sky flying very slowly in single file and emitting no sound.;2012-07-04 18:00:00;8 minutes;Nine unidentified flying objects in the night sky flying very slowly in single file and emitting no sound. The evening of July 4th, my husband and I heard fireworks going off in our immediate neighborhood and  went outside our home to see them.   We searched the sky for several minutes only to find most of the fireworks had ended.  We were just about to go back inside when we saw several objects flying in the night's sky, one right after another (we counted 9 of them).   At first we thought they were helicopters headed for Camp David but they were moving much too slowly and they didn't make a sound.   They each disappeared at the same spot by going into some very light cloud cover.  Oddly enough, they never emerged on the other side of these clouds.
