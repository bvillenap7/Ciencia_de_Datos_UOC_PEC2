silver gold disc flew over Montgomery County Fairgrounds left to right, did a 90 degree upwards and disappeared;1979-08-15 23:00:00;1-2 minutes;silver gold disc flew over Montgomery County Fairgrounds left to right, did a 90 degree upwards and disappeared At the Montgomery County Fair (sometime in summer either 1979 or 1980), my two friends and I saw a silvery/gold disc fly over the horizon (a quarter would have covered the disc), flying from right to left.  It turned 90 degrees and flew up, until it was very small, seemed to dart around in a dance and disappear.  Thatâ€™s all.  I believe.

I was in the back seat of a moving vehicle in Gaithersburg, Maryland when I saw a bright, gold, circular object to the east;2011-01-16 20:12:00;2 miuntes;I was in the back seat of a moving vehicle in Gaithersburg, Maryland when I saw a bright, gold, circular object to the east I was in the backseat of a moving vehicle. It was about 20:12 when I saw a Bright, gold, circular object to the east. It was no reflection coming from the windshield it was not a star because it appeared to move and it was too bright. To add on, it was not an airplane because it had  only one light, not a bunch of lights like airplanes do have and lastly, this object moved like no aircraft. Then, at about 20:13, the object moved slowly towards the north and then back south to the point where it was directly overhead. After looking straight up at this Bright object for about a minute, my neck started to hurt. I only observed one object. Suddenly, I was amazed to see that the object started to dim in brightness to the point where it wasn't bright anymore and eventually to the point where it faded into the night sky.;39.1366513513514;-77.2180229729731
