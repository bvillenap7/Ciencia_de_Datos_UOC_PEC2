O;2006-06-22 21:00:00;15 Seconds;I was driving in my neighborhood, at around 9:30 at night.  The sky was clear. I was driving into my neighborhood from east to west.  Out of nowhere came a huge green fireball.  It traveled rapidly then disappeared. It only lasted about 15 seconds -tops.  My first thought was not actually a meteor, ufo or comet. It actually was about north Korea's recent threats to test fire a missile( I did not logically think about distance from N. Korea and the possibility).  I then continued home.I had never seen anything like that before.;39.1366513513514;-77.2180229729731
Orange fireball over Gaithersburg MD on 04/12/2012;2012-04-10 22:30:00;2 seconds;Orange fireball over Gaithersburg MD on 04/12/2012 When I was walking my dog before bed time around 10:30pm-11:00pm, I saw an orange fireball with tail flying from south east to north west in the sky. It flew with high speed that I was not able to see clearly.  It was definitely not an airplane.  It was pretty low and disappeared behind the distant trees.  I thought it was going to crash to the earth and waited for the sound from the explossion.  But nothing happened. Anybody else saw it?
