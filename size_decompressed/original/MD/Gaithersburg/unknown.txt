Red flashing light, two green lights on either side.;2015-08-22 22:00:00;2 minutes;Red flashing light, two green lights on either side. As me and my father were walking out of the Montgomery County fair parking lot, what we can only describe as what looked like a commercial airplane, (green wing lights, red flashing tail light) zoomed out of the lights from the midway carnival rides about 1000 feet up.  About 100 feet away from us, it abruptly stopped in mid air, and hovered in the air for around two minutes.   At some point, my dad decided to pull out his phone, to try to take a picture of it but before he could, it then went from 0 to 50 back to the lights of the midway.  It was soundless, and I could not make out the shape of the craft.  I use ufo in a semi broad sense, as I think it could have just been a drone.;39.1366513513514;-77.2180229729731

But as I looked again they were too big and too bright to be. I kept staring and they moved a bit but primarly stood still. One looked smaller than the other who was much much brighter. My partner came back from walking our dogs and stood outside to take pictures of it. Letting me know that she experienced something weeks ago but around 4am before heading to work. And thought she was seeing things since she was still tired. The objects with bright lights stayed there for about 30 minutes or more. The last time I went back and looked they seemed to fade away like moving back away from us but without movement if that makes sense.
