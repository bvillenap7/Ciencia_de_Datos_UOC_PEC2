The formation traveled to the southeast at a high altitude untill it passed from my sight. I can say it was higher that average air traffic, wich I witness on a daily basis. I was observing the lunar eclipse on 1/20/00 at 11:10 pm. I witnessed a triangular formation of lights in the sky that passed between me and the moon. There were 11 lights in the formation of an equalateral triangle. The triangle shaped formation of lights did not vary in shape at all. The intensity of the light also remained constant, about that of a dim star, but varied in color from amber to faint red. They traveled from northwest to southeast over the Belcamp area.
