Two lights hovering in the early, morning, sky for  almost a  half  hour.  ((NUFORC Note:  Conjunction of Jupiter and Venus?  PD));2014-08-18 05:00:00;20 minutes;Two lights hovering in the early, morning, sky for  almost a  half  hour. My husband and I were on our way to work this morning, and I  noticed two  lights hovering in the sky.   I told my husband to look at  the two lights.  At  first, he  said it was probably a  helicopter. I was sure it was not.  The two lights were stationery, and looked like a big craft.   There were no stars in the sky.  I observed them for the entire car ride.  By the time we got home, my husband knew it was not a helicopter! ((NUFORC Note:  Possible conjunction of Jupiter and Venus, which occurred on this date.

Orange sphere seen by 2 people in Belcamp, MD.;2015-08-15 23:10:00;3 minutes;Orange sphere seen by 2 people in Belcamp, MD. Was driving home and I saw 2 orange light in the sky flying towards Edgewood, MD. I was a passenger in the car and told my girlfriend to pull over.  Once she stopped the car the two lights change their direction in the opposite way and flew out of range of my camera phone.   All of a sudden one light started to flicker and the disappeared.  The other kept flying until if got over a tree line in the distance and do the same thing.   The weird thing is when both lights changed direction they were both right over us and looked about as high a plane would fly while doing airborne operations about 800 to 1500 feet.  I am Airborne, so I would know that height, but I heard no sound of engines or anything.   Not sure what it was but it was very bright and really weird.
