Looking through a skylight on a clear day.  At a very high altitude a UFO flew across in the limited view of the skylight from southwest to towards the northeast at an extremely fast rate of speed.  Unless it was some experimental craft there isn't any to my knowledge that can fly this fast.  I know that military aircraft fly at higher altitudes than commercial craft but this was extremely fast for any craft.  I've also seen the shuttle pass by and that wasn't traveling near as fast as this craft.;38.7992;-76.5287
