As my son and I were walking out of the school, we noticed a bright light above the southwestern horizon.  We watched it for about 2 minutes.  I thought that it was a plane heading toward us.   I turned and began to walk to my car.  As I turned, my son noticed the light move upwards and then to the east.  Then it disappeared.   He called out to me.  As I turned back to look, the light was completely gone.   I am not sure how far away from the object we were.  So Iâ€™m not sure of the exact distance it traveled before disappearing.   The apparent distance from the spot where we first noticed the light to where it disappeared was about 2 inches.  It traveled this distance in about 2 seconds.
