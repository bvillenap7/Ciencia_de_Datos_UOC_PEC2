Around 8:40 pm on a very clear night, I saw about 5 maybe more lights in sky about northwest. At first they were very still in a line start near land going upward. I thought they were stars and thought it was strange that I never saw them there before. Then they in unison moved slowly upward, into middle of sky then spread out. Some say satellites, Iâ€™m not sure what it was.;38.4941;-76.53
