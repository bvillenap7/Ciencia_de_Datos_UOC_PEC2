It landed across the water from our house and after a short time, it disappeared in a giant flash of light. My family and I were woken up at about 12:30 by a low humming noise.  I was the first one to the window and saw an object- probably about 100-150 feet long- with a  bright light encompassing it descending from the sky, approximately 3/4 mile away.  It landed across the water from our house behind a line of trees, where it sat for about 2 minutes, during which time all we could see was a glow extending above the tree line.  After 2-3 minutes there was a bright flash and then nothing.  We checked the general area of the landing- very rural- the next day, but found no signs of anything.  We brought our dog with us- a hunting dog who had been bird hunting in this area with us many times.  Although we didn't notice that the area had been physically disturbed, our dog acted very odd-  very nervous, like he does in the middle of a thunder storm.  But when we got him back in the boat and away from the area he calmed down and returned to normal.;38.7742;-76.0759
