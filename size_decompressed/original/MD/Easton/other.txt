PD));2009-09-19 20:30:00;10 seconds;An orb of light raised from the ground, in the distance, slowly into the high sky, then disappeared. I was looking out of my bathroom window, looking out past the farm behind my house. It was nighttime. In the distance I see a bright orange light appear from the ground, and slowly rise up. It continued to rise slowly and brightly into the sky. It raised extremely high into the sky, and then disappeared. I do not think it was a regular thing, planes go sideways, helicopters don't fly that high, flares are faster and less precise on where they're going, and a firework would have left a trail. The experience left me dumbfounded and perplexed. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));38.7742;-76.0759
