Fireball going into a double circle type cloud formation.;2003-06-30 02:10:00;20mins;Fireball going into a double circle type cloud formation. On 30/June/2003 at 02:10 hrs. Clear skys, no winds. I observed two large cloud like objects to the south of where I was standing. The outter ring was large and perfectly round. The inner circle was the same. The outter and inner circle had even space between them, at which I could see the night sky behind it. As my girlfriend and I were watching the cloud like object, another object fireball like was just over head of both of us. The fireball object shot along the sky going south towards the double cloud like rings. As the fire ball moved closer to the circles, it threw off a light streak that was as bright as day, it looked like it had a tail, comet like. When the fireball entered the center of the cloud it vanished from sight. The tail of this object remained for 10 mins. After the fireball vanished the circle remained until about 20 mins later, after that there was no trace of the objects. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible missile launches out of Wallops Island, VA.
