A wwhite flashing UFO zipping below storm clouds.;2001-05-26 22:00:00;45 min (intermittent);A wwhite flashing UFO zipping below storm clouds. This night there was a thunderstorm, and so no plane was ever in evidence.  This sighting was entirely below storm clouds.  THree times I saw a blinking white light--first, about 10, low, going back and forth a few times.  It disappeared when I told Dad to look at it.  THe second time, I happened to glance out my window and it blinked three times, perfectly stationary--and I know there's no tower in that spot.  THe third time--wow!  At about 10:40, the light started careening wildly around, probably did it for 7 seconds or so, and then I stopped watching.  I didn't want to see any more!;39.6573;-76.5738
The white lights were back again!;2001-05-27 21:30:00;15 mins.;The white lights were back again! I saw these *things* again--I'd gotten over last night and started watching again.  From about 9:30 PM to 10 PM, towards the NE and SE, I saw a light blinking three times, then no further activity.  One of these was yellowish, moving vertically, one white and stationary, and one of them was white and moving diagonally up, and it blinked three times, than another three before it disappeared.  The only one that didn't do this was SE and very low, moving back and forth behind some trees.  I only see one at a time, so I don't know how many there are. I think this is a regular occurrence, and shall try to keep watching. On a weirder note, the things seem to disappear when I call them to the attention of another person.  I am probably reading too much into this, but there have been other stories like that. Oh yes-and that night, before sunset, I saw four military choppers in the area.  You never know..
