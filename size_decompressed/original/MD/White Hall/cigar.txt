Large White Lights Over Baltimore County.;2018-11-14 19:30:00;5 minutes;Large White Lights Over Baltimore County. Very large set of white lights in the sky.  Many military planes flew toward it which gave perspective of the size.  It was quite large.  The lights were far off in the distance and took up a good deal of space in the sky.  When we saw the military planes flying towards it and saw how little they looked compared to it, it became obvious that whatever they were flying towards was quite large.  It looked like a long cylinder with many white lights.  As soon as the planes flew over our house, the lights disappeared. About 5 min later, the military planes were flying back the other direction from which they came.  One flew right over the deck and was very large.  Its wings looked like a B52.;39.6573;-76.5738
