Observed a High Speed flight of a Fast moving object;2002-01-27 12:45:00;10 Sec;Observed a High Speed flight of a Fast moving object I went to the door of my Family room to look out at the Garden. It faces slightly ENE. I looked into a tree and spoote two Morning Doves on two different Branches. While I studied them, my attention was attraced to a streaking object from my right to left in a clear Royal Blue cloudless sky. I was watching a replay of Wall Street Week with Louis Roukeyser on WMPT. As he finished with his banter with is weekly guests, he said Now it is time to answer some questions from our viewers. It was precisely at the start of this sentance that the object was first seen by me and it was gone before the end of that same sentance. It was travelling at a speed that was unbelievable. It made no sound and left no trail. I went to my neighbors and told him of my experience. We then watched above as the Commercial Airliners made their con-trails above in the sky. At approximately 1300 -1310, we both observed a USAF Tanker travelling from South to North. I mentioned that it had a small craft beneath it. My neighbor said it was part of the plane, until about two minutes later when a silver white object detached from the Tanker, dipped below, moved left and the up and over. It then headed South towards DC at a high rate of speed as detected by sound, but not visual.;39.1585;-77.0837000000001
