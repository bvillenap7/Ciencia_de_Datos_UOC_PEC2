I was smoking a cigarette on my third floor balcony and noticed a bright light that was flickering to my southeast.  I came in and picked up my camera and started to film the light.  Through the camera I was able to see different colors flickering within the bright light. It seems as though you could see some type of structure within the light.  The light got really bright then just faded away.;39.4212055374592;-77.4079605863195
Black object hovering in daytime sky;2021-07-10 12:00:00;10 minutes;Black object hovering in daytime sky I saw a black object hovering in the daytime sky over Frederick, MD.  It appeared in between clouds and seemed to briefly disappear behind one, then reappear.  Hovered or moved slowly.  Using binoculars, I could see it was strangely shaped, sort of squarish with protrusions (not wings).  I had already observed numerous birds, jets with entrails, and planes and it was not any of those.  I looked online for possible satellites or ISS in my area and I didn't see those listed. I also tried to see if there were any other reports of a sighting but did not find any.;39.4212055374592;-77.4079605863195
