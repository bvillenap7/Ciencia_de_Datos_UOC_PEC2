This cloud glowed with light similar to a fluorescent lamp over a 25 mile range. Despite the sunrise it did not change to the typical pickish color that clouds do when the sun rises or sets.It stayed bright white and looked like no other cloud I have seen. I guess it could have been some sort of reflective entrail... at any rate it was very odd ((NUFORC Note:  Reported to be re-entry of Soviet space debris.  PD));39.4212055374592;-77.4079605863195
Reddish-Brown Cigar-Shaped Object Flies Over Frederick, MD.;2013-06-11 17:45:00;5 seconds;Reddish-Brown Cigar-Shaped Object Flies Over Frederick, MD I saw a cigar-shaped object flying fast across the sky, about 1000 - 2000 ft in the air, moving into Frederick from the SSW heading northward.  I noticed how fast it was flying and then realized that it didn't appear to have any wings like a plane.  I thought of it being a plane or helicopter or drone aircraft, but it moved fast like a fighter jet, but there was absolutely no sound.  The craft was a reddish-brown color with a gray front end, ironically like a lighted cigar.  I watched it until I couldn't see it any more behind a building, but about 10-15 seconds later, I watched a commercial plane taking off into the sky from the Frederick airport, which was apparently larger and the wings were noticeable.  I watch numerous aircraft flying through this area on a daily basis and nothing flies like this object did.  My location during this sighting was just south of the Westview Regal 16 theater.;39.4212055374592;-77.4079605863195
