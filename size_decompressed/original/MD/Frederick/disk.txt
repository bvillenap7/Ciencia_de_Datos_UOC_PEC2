The ship was studying something on the ground.  ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  PD));2002-02-17 21:00:00;5 minutes;The ship was studying something on the ground. I looked outside the window of my car and saw the disk float around for only a little while then disappered but came right back into view.  My sons also saw the UFO.   It wasn't a very dark night so it was easy to see.  It was a bright, white color with yellow,green and light blue signals emitting out of it.   The object looked like it was studying something because it stayed in the same spot for quite a while.  There seemed to be a light energy field traveling behind it which stayed until the object was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.  Student report.
