Four very bright white lights that hovered.;2010-08-08 20:53:00;under a minute;Four very bright white lights that hovered. I am writing this on behalf of my daughters: There were three girls involved in the sighting my daughters which are 14 and 11 and there friend who is 12.   They think the whole idea of UFO’s are silly and have little to no knowledge on the subject. We were leaving the swimming pool and walking to the cellar doors which are about 10 feet away.  It was around 9 pm and was almost dark out.   We noticed a bright light on the ground in the middle of the yard and looked up.  There were four really bright lights just hovering there, they were about the size of basketballs.   There were three outer lights that formed a triangle and one in the middle.  The lights were very bright and white we could not make out any details of a plan, ships etc…  My sister handed me the digital camera (we had been taking underwater pictures in the pool, so we had the camera with us) and we took four pictures.  I am not sure what setting my camera was on I just turned it on and took pictures.  There was no sound except for some kind of whishing noise when it took off.  I’m not sure how long it hovered, seconds.  Then it slowly drifted across the backyard toward the woods and then took off and was gone.  As it took off it turned to the left and! seemed to leave trails of light for just a few seconds.  We were very scared and are not sure what it was.;39.4212055374592;-77.4079605863195
Unknown object in the sky that did not move.;2015-09-16 14:45:00;5-10 minutes;Unknown object in the sky that did not move. My daughter and I we heading home from school and she noticed in the Southwestern sky what appeared to be two planes.  She said that one was odd as it did not appear to be moving and we could clearly see the other plane moving with contrails behind it. I pulled over in a parking lot to observe the sky.  She pointed out that the object appeared to be facing downwards and stationary with small V shaped contrails that came together as the object came to a point.  We could still see the other plane moving to the right of the object. It was odd sight as we continued looking at the object it then went back from a dot to what we had first seen an object facing downwards with the same small V shaped contrails behind it.  I continued home in the hopes of viewing from my home but trees we blocking that area in the sky.;39.4212055374592;-77.4079605863195
