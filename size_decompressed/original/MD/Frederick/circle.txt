Silent orangish-red silent objects in the night sky;2012-07-22 22:30:00;10-15 minutes;Silent orangish-red silent objects in the night sky Sunday evening at 10:30 pm July 22, my husband and I were sitting on our front porch facing southeast.  Suddenly, looking south to the house across the street I saw a bright orange light. It moved off to the east, seemed to go higher and then disappeared.  As it went to the east towards Baltimore there was suddenly another one approaching us from the south. It also went east and went higher and then disappeared from sight.  I spoke to my husband right away and we both went out to the front yard and stood there entranced.  We could not understand what these were as they were very silent. There was no aircraft noise at all.  The amazing thing was the objects kept coming from the south going east for about 10 minutes in time.  I did not count but I would estimate that there were at least 10 perhaps 12 in all. Midway through the sighting there was a formation of 3 bright orange lights together that seemed to make a triangle shape. After this there were single objects ! again. They moved very deliberately, not very fast, but steadily. As they turned east they seemed to rise and they seemed to be going faster and then they disappeared from sight. At  one point I mentioned my son’s telescope to my husband. There was not tine to get it and set it up so my husband went inside for our binoculars. At that point there was one more orange light coming over the trees. As it turned east I trained the binoculars on it. I could make out what appeared to be a large disc shaped object that had row upon row of lights on it. It was in a vertical position like a satellite dish. I felt the lights were all separate as there seemed to be areas of black between the lights. It was rather hard to be sure of this but it is the impression I got when using the binoculars. This turned out to be the last object we saw.;39.4212055374592;-77.4079605863195
NOISELESS OBJECTS MOVING OVER FREDERICK, MD.;2012-07-22 22:30:00;10-15 seconds;NOISELESS OBJECTS MOVING OVER FREDERICK, MD. WHILE MY WIFE AND I WERE SITTING ON OUR FRONT PORCH ON SUNDAY EVENING JULY 22, 2012 AT ABOUT 10:30PM,   WE OBSERVED STRANGE ORANGISH-RED OBJECTS IN THE SKY THAT WERE MOVING VERY SLOWLY.   MY IMMEDIATE THOUGHT WAS THAT THEY WERE SOME SORT OF AIRCRAFT, BUT THEN IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THEY WEREN’T MAKING ANY NOISE.   ALSO IT SEEMED THAT THEY WERE MOVING IN A SINGLE FILE FORMATION UNTIL THREE WERE IN A TRIANGULAR FORMATION FOLLOWED BY MORE SINGLE FILE OBJECTS SIMILAR TO THE FIRST ONES WE SAW.  TO ME THEY SEEMED LIKE VERY INTENSE BRIGHT LIGHTS THAT WERE ROTATING LIKE A BEACON. THEY APPEARED TO COME FROM THE WASHINGTON, D.C. AREA OVER OUR TOWN, FREDERICK, MD, AND THEN OFF TOWARD BALTIMORE IN AN EASTERLY DIRECTION. WE ARE IN THE GLIDEPATH FOR BALTIMORE-WASHINGTON INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT AND  I THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS PASSING AIRCRAFT MAY HAVE ALSO SEEN THEM AS WELL.   SOME FLEW OVER OUR HOUSE AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME AS THE OBJECTS.;39.4212055374592;-77.4079605863195
Floating orb;2013-07-06 23:37:00;2 minutes;Floating orb There was one single object that flew across the sky very slowly from west to sw approximately.   We were sitting outside enjoying the night when we looked up and saw it.   There are a lot of planes that fly through the area but this was at a much higher altitude.   It also just disappeared suddenly in the sky.   It was flying to slow to be a shooting star and was to Gish and fast to be a plane.   It looked like a star but did not act like one.   I assumed it was a satellite but I checked reports and could not find any that would be visible at that time.;39.4212055374592;-77.4079605863195

I noticed the object as I was passing Casa Rico and followed it until I got off on the 70 W exit.   I saw the object move across the sky and continue its course following route 40.   I took a short video but stopped recording when I thought it was not visible because of how dark it was outside.   This morning I realized the object is visible in the video.;39.4212055374592;-77.4079605863195
