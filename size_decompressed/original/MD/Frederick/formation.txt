5 or 6 oranges objects seen flying over Frederick MD  11/29/2013 18:50.;2013-11-29 18:50:00;10 minutes;5 or 6 oranges objects seen flying over Frederick MD  11/29/2013 18:50 My wife was closing the blinds upstairs, and see yelled down to me, come up stairs and look at this, come up stairs an look at this.  When I got upstairs and looked out the window at approximately 6:50PM on 11/29/2013 I saw 5 or 6 orange objects in the sky moving towards the S/SSE direction at a decent rate of speed, probably as fast as a plane would be seen traversing the sky, flying in a simple formation.  I looked to see if the corners of the formation were steady, hoping to see a mother ship, but they were independently moving.   The objects were overhead, not directly, overhead like if you were looking out a window.  It appeared to me that one of the ships was a laggard and moving more quickly to catch up to the rest, I cupped my eyes out the window and looked at laggard object catching up and did see a rotating light pattern moving about a pentagon or hexagon shape, red, green, blue, after a few minutes the objects disappeared either behind a clouds, fog! , or they just faded out.   There was no sound from the crafts whatsoever.  Weird.;39.4212055374592;-77.4079605863195
Large blue craft hovers in neighborhood with large beam of light seemingly targeting house.;2015-02-06 05:00:00;Seconds;Large blue craft hovers in neighborhood with large beam of light seemingly targeting house. I couldn't sleep.  I had too many thoughts about starting my garden.  I was in bed right by the window.  Even though the blinds were mostly  shut, I could see a tremendous beam of light very close and part of a vehicle or hovering device that had shades of blue in the shape of like a transformer, or cubicles attached to one another.  It made no noise.  It hovered with beam seemingly targeted toward my house or my window.  I froze, I had my phone about to call my son in another room.  I remember giving an affirmation that no one is taking me.  Before you know it it just disappeared sideways and I ran to my son's room and told him I was frightened as to what occurred. Of course he thought I had dreamed it, that I probably fell asleep and I said I rarely remember dreams and I couldn't sleep.  I had too many thoughts about starting my garden.

Of course he thought I had dreamed it, that I probably fell asleep and I said I rarely remember dreams and this was so vivid.  In all my years of being on this earth I had never been so frightened as to have to go to my son's room and had him hold me. Earlier about an hour prior to this incident I happened to observe a bright star go dim, fade and then go  bright again.  For a moment I thought maybe this was connected.   That maybe it wasn't a star  maybe I was observed  and then this thing just zoomed down out of nowhere.  Whatever it was, perhaps a vision of a A vehicle instead of a vision of an angel, I certainly wasn't looking for it  and it was very real to me.;39.4212055374592;-77.4079605863195
A formation of lights in a checkmark pattern moving very fast across the sky.  ((anonymous report));2017-03-22 22:25:00;4-5 seconds;A formation of lights in a checkmark pattern moving very fast across the sky. My brother and I were taking out the trash around 10:20 to 10:25pm.  He stopped to finish his cigarette before walking inside and said wow look how bright the stars are tonight.  We stood looking at the stars for 30-40 seconds.   Then we saw a formation of dim lights coming from the south and heading north north west and crossed over Route 40.  The formation was almost like a chevron but without equal number of lights on each side.   There were four lights in a straight line then two more creating a kind of check mark moving across the sky.   The lights stayed in a solid formation while it was moving so we're sure it was a single craft.  It was hard to judge how high it was flying but we came to conclude it was only one to two thousand ft in the air.  It covered alot of air space very quickly and was flying at least four times faster than a typical airplane that we're used to seeing.   Also, this craft was completely silent We both ran inside to call for our stepdad to come out and by the time we looked again it was gone.  We would really like to know what it was and we hope this information can help. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of the report elects to remain semi-anonymous provides little contact information.
