Looking to the west at 45 degrees above the horizon a bright white light disappears;2006-11-18 21:20:00;5 seconds;Looking to the west at 45 degrees above the horizon a bright white light disappears I saw a light in the sky larger than a star and brighter than a star but muted or blurry looking.  It rapidly began to fade.  This process took roughly 5 seconds.  It also appeared to be moving, but just slightly, at a direction of west to east.  After the light disappeared I did not see it again.  I am a 25 male who sells books.  I have never reported anything like this before because I haven't seen anything this differant in space before.;39.4212055374592;-77.4079605863195
Star suddenly moved and disappeared!  ((NUFORC Note:  Probable sighting of Venus, Jupiter, and twinkling star?  PD));2007-06-07 23:30:00;45 min;Star suddenly moved and disappeared! All of my report happened between 11:00pm-11:45pm.   There was an unusually bright star in the sky so I got my binoculars. It felt out of place so I kept an eye on it.  On the opposite side of the horizon there was a star near what is typically the brightest star in the sky that was blinking red and green and white.   I was now keeping an eye on the big out of place one and the one that was giving off three colors. Neither moved at all and during a span of 40 min I managed to see 2 meteors streak across the sky.  After 40 min I started looking at all of the stars through my binoculars to see if any other ones gave off any green or red.  When I was finished scanning the less neck cramping stars I focused on a bright star directly overhead, then all of sudden it started moving.   I was able to track it as it picked up speed got smaller and disappeared.  From the time it started moving it was gone in about 2 seconds.  Completely in shock I turned around to see that the very bright out of place star that I kept an eye on for 40 min was gone.  The star with red and green never went anywhere so I'm sure there is a logical explanation for that one.;39.4212055374592;-77.4079605863195

Brilliant blue pinpoint of light fading in and out.;2014-04-04 22:15:00;5 minutes;Brilliant blue pinpoint of light fading in and out My wife and I were walking outside to get in our cars, when my wife called my name and asked me if I saw a light in the sky.   I walked closer to her and within seconds spotted a pinpoint of very bright blue light which lasted for about two seconds then faded out.   Maybe ten or fifteen seconds later it appeared again.  This object was maybe 30 degrees up.  I have no idea of the size as it only appeared as a pinpoint.   The object repeated this cycle of fading in and out over the span of a few minutes, during the whole span of time it covered maybe a palms width of sky at arms length.   There was no sound and the gap between flashes seemed random at about ten to thirty seconds.   What struck me was the intensity of the light.  It was a deep sapphire blue and it was so bright it almost glistened - like the visual effect you see when looking at a laser.;39.4212055374592;-77.4079605863195
Yellow (White), red and green lights emulating from stationary object over Ft. Detrick for about 15 mins;2014-09-23 21:00:00;15 minutes;Yellow(White), Red and Green lights emulating from stationary object over Ft. Detrick for about 15 mins Upon looking out at my back yard with views facing southeast, south, southwest I saw a bright light that hovered south over the Ft. Detrick area.  I am about 2-3 miles from Ft. Detrick.  Lights would change from yellow (or white), red and sometimes flash green.  Stayed there for a long time (15 mins) until it just disappeared.  Looked at the light from 3 different vantage points (1st floor, 2nd floor, backyard) and it stayed stationary in regards to its surrounding.   When I got the binoculars out all you could make out were the lights which changed from white to red to green in no particular order.  In the last minutes it did not flash any green.  Planes are typical all around the area and were visible in sky at time and the UFO was not large like a plane nor did it have the 3 lights that a plane usually displays, Was around 8:50-9:10 estimated time.  Sky was clear and mars was still visible in the south west. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));39.4212055374592;-77.4079605863195
