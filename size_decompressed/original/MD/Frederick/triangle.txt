My wife, our roommate and myself were driving north on Rt. 15, in Frederick, MD, on our way home from shopping.  I was behind the wheel.  About a half mile from our exit, I noticed what, at first, looked like a very bright star over the area of Fort Detrick, to our left.  My wife noticed it around the same time. Suddenly, we both realized it couldn’t be a star, because it was moving at an extremely high speed, in an easterly direction.  We tried to follow it visually as we exited off the highway at the Motter Road exit. Turning right onto Motter Road, we crossed a little bridge, and pulled immediately into the empty parking lot of a veterinary office on the right, overlooking Rt. 15.  We could still just barely make out whatever it was we were seeing as it disappeared into the east. Suddenly, we all noticed directly overhead, two more objects, triangular shaped, all with flashing lights around them.  They were also heading east, but crossing over each other in very close proximity. Then, from the north, we saw one more triangular shaped object, also with flashing lights, heading southeast.  It seemed like it was catching up to the other objects. Finally, we saw one object north east of our position, that just stayed stationary.  None of these objects made any sound in the entire time we observed them. We watched this for ten or fifteen minutes, before getting in our car and heading home.  On the way home (we live quite near Fort Detrick), we thought we saw one more of the triangular-shaped objects.  It was being followed at high speed by a plane we assumed to be military. And that’s what we saw.  I should note — our roommate shot pictures and video with her iphone — nothing showed up in either the photos or video.;39.4212055374592;-77.4079605863195
