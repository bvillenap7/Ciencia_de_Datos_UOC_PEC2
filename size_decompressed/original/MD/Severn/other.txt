Three random chunks of car-sized brown mold motionless in a clear blue sky near BWI.  ((NUFORC Note:  USAF Acad. Grad.  PD));2012-10-19 18:00:00;3-5 minutes;Three random chunks of car-sized &quotbrown mold&quot motionless in a clear blue sky near BWI Others saw it too!  Stuck in traffic near BWI, we saw three differently sized, very odd-shaped solid objects motionless in a clear blue sky several hundred feet above the ground roughly a mile east of Telegraph Road and Reece Road.  It was not smoke, balloons, a hang-glider or any known vehicle or object.   I first thought it was debris like a sheet of black plastic that had been carried into the sky but the three pieces stayed relatively motionless during the 3-5 minutes that I watched it.  I can only describe it as resembling a dark brown mold.    As an Air Force Academy grad with 30 years working in aerospace, I can safely say that it was not a conventional aerodynamic design of any kind and seemed unlikely to be debris.  I was totally freaked out and baffled.   Did anyone else report something strange like this?;39.1269;-76.698
