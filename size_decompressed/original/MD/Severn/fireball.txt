Observed green fireball in South sky falling straight down;1998-12-17 20:38:00;5 Seconds;Observed green fireball in South sky falling straight down On 12/17/98 (Thursday) at 8:38PM (2038hrs) my husband and I were driving west on Quarterfield Rd. in Severn, MD when I observed a Green Fireball in the south sky. I reacted by stating, there's one of those green things! My husband also observed this object as a green fireball decending at 90 degrees to the horizon at a rate of maybe, 150 ft/sec. I would estimate it's distance at 1/2 mile away and disapeared approximately 75-100 ft from the ground. We observed the object turn, White and then appeared to have a tail for about 1 second before it disapeared. The object's size could be compared to a dime held at arm's length. A simular object was observed by us 2 years ago (unreported) in the area of Towson, MD.;39.1269;-76.698
