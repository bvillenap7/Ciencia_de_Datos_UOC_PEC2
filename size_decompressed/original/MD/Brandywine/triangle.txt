Strange rotating debris and triangular vessell above Brandywine;2016-09-25 12:00:00;10 minutes;Strange rotating debris and triangular vessell above Brandywine Saw what appeared to be a piece of paper or plastic very high in the sky.  The object was in a state of constant rotation, and appeared unaffected by any wind turbulence.  It was heading due south along MD Route 301.   At the same height , but spaced approx. 100 feet away was a dark metallic triangular shaped craft with dark red lights at each tip.  Both objects were moving at the same clip, both due south.  I was able to pull my truck over and make these observations with a pair of binoculars.   My wife and son were with me and it was actually my wife that noticed the objects and pointed them out to me.  I could only track them for a few minutes because the sun was very bright making it hard to keep a visual.;38.6922;-76.832
