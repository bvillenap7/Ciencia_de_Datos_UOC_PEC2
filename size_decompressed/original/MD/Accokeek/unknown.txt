All lights went out, the radio, all electrical equipment, while the engine kept running.  I got out of the vehicle to see what was wrong and heard a loud humming.  I could not see anything even though it was a clear night.  The trees and a nearby water tower blocked the view that I thought was near the sound I heard.  This was a realtively new vehicle at the time and had never experienced any electrical problems whatsoever.  It never experienced any electrical problems after the incidents.  While I am not certain it was connected to a UFO sighting, I had heard of vehicles that had experienced UFO's with the same type of symptons.  I am interested if any other folks have experienced similar incidents. I will never forget the erie feeling that I had, especially after it happend three times in a row in the exact same place at about the exact time. After my first encounter with the incident I made it a point to drive slowly through the same area during the next htree evenings thinking that something might be wrong with my vehicle.  Nothing was wrong with my vehicle. I had it checked out the following day after the first incident and the electrician said he couldnt find anything wrong with it.;38.6704;-77.0117
