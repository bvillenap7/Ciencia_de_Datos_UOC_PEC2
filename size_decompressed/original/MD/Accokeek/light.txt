ball of light flew over vehicle at treetop level and vanished;2011-10-25 06:50:00;15 seconds;ball of light flew over vehicle at treetop level and vanished driving north on Indian Head Hwy (210) in Accokeek, Maryland, when I saw a ball of light pass over my vehicle at a high rate of speed.  There was a plane nearby above the ball of light at a much higher altitude.  I could tell that this light was different, than airplane lights.   I looked up and saw it, and I believe the other drivers saw it also, but we didn't stop.  It appeared only for maybe 15 seconds, above my vehicle.   It passed over head and then seemed to vanish.   I didn't see it again. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  We suspect an evening sighting, but we have no way to confirm that fact.
