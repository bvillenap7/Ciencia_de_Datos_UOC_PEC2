On each of the three tips of the triangle was a white light and in the middle of the craft was a round duller light that glowed pink in a plasma effect.  It moved so slowly I was scared that if it was an aircraft that the airspeed would not have been enough to generate lift.  I was not the only person that saw this.  I had no idea what this could be until I saw an article on the TR-3B.  This was it.;39.2147;-76.0795
