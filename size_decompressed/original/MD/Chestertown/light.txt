Light makes two 90 degree turns at high rate of speed.;2010-11-01 22:00:00;5 seconds;Light makes two 90 degree turns at high rate of speed. Early Nov 2010 at approx 2200 Hrs, due east of Chestertown, Maryland, I observed at a distance of approx 2 miles, a single white or yellow steady light (not flashing or blinking) moving at a slow speed in a north to south direction, at a low altitude. The light suddenly stopped, dropped 90 degrees straight down at a rate of speed faster than a free falling object, made a 90 degree turn to the south, and accelerated almost instantly at an extreme high rate of speed. Weather was clear and cool, no cloud cover. Dover AFB approx due east approx 30 miles. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));39.2147;-76.0795
