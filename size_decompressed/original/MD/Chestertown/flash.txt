Every 10 seconds flashing green light;2011-09-15 21:15:00;2 hours;every 10 seconds flashing green light We saw a light strobe every 10 seconds ( we counted mississippi and one one thousand(S)). the color was green, and it was in the sky. it was in the general direction of the setting sun. I called a friend that lives almost 20 miles away and he and his girl could see the same thing, flashing every 10 seconds. to me it looked as if the light was curving.. so from what i saw it was making a half circle. my friend that i called said it looked as if it was coming straight twords him. while this was happening we saw a bright light ( brighter than anything else in the sky) that looked to be a plane.. yet it was bigger... it moved from the tree line ( miles away) up twords the green flashing light.. and i watched it move from one spot in the sky to another in a second. i've watched air planes my hole life, and this thing moved fast it moved an area on the window i was looking out of of about 5 inchs in 1 second.. then slowed down to an almost normal speed. as i was w! atching this i told my girl friend to come look, and our friend that lives 20 miles away called and asked if i just saw the light move across the sky fast as shit. as i was telling him what i saw and confirmed we are looking at the same thing..  it just vanished.  gone and we never saw it again.. the flashing green light went on for a while.. and when we looked back around 10 ish to see if it was there still it was gone, BUT there were now numerous  human aircraft flying in the general area of the flashing light. we could tell the human craft from the unknown light because of the landing lights the human craft have.;39.2147;-76.0795
