An irregular flight pattern zig zagging then back and forth and up and down with a light as bright as a star;2004-11-07 04:00:00;20 seconds;An irregular flight pattern zig zagging then back and forth and up and down with a light as bright as a star I was up at 4 am drawing the jupiter/venus alignment, everytime a plane or satillite would go across the sky it catches my eye.each time these crafts have a flight pattern that goes in a arc.then i saw a flash of light which caught my attention. this light jumped irradically from what seems to me from constellation to constellation. a very irradical pattern zig zag then back and forth and up and down again but courisly enough still in a arc it must have lasted 20 seconds or so then gone again, very strange but acceptable. this to me only gives more credit to God just like an author or artist can creat different books or works of art God can create different worlds.;39.0991100877192;-76.843723245614
Heard sounds of humming over the trees for one hour early morning.  Saw lights above the trees moving and flashing beams on the ground;2005-07-05 03:10:00;one hour or so;Heard sounds of humming over the trees for one hour early morning.  Saw lights above the trees moving and flashing beams on the ground I was awaken by a loud but low humming noise.  I thought there were people mowing their lawn so early in the morning.  The window in our room was open because it was particularly hot.  That was why I heard the sound outside.  I am a light sleeper and I can be awakened by any sound that is unfamiliar to my ears.  I tried to sleep through the sound, again still thinking that someone was mowing the lawn.  But the sound went from soft to loud, like it was moving far and near.  I still could not get back to sleep and was already intrigued by the unfamiliarity of the sound.  I decided to check it out.  I looked out the window and I saw in the sky just above the trees bright ligts, white, blue and yellow, moving very slowly horizontally.  That was the one that was making the humming or whirling sound. I woke my husband up because I thought I just saw a UFO.  He also saw the lights but he dismissed it as just a helicopter hovering.  And went right back to sleep.  I observed it for some more minutes because I could not believe that it was only a helicopter.  I know how a helicopter sounds like.  But this one was really different.  It hovered close to our building and I thought I saw a light beaming from it down the ground, like a huge flashlight looking for something.  If it was a police helicopter then where are the police cars?  Nothing was happening in the area, no movement of people or cars.  It was just peaceful except this hovering, humming sound getting louder and softer every minute.;39.0991100877192;-76.843723245614

At the Laurel Lake watching the fireworks and a circular formation surrounded by lights appeared in the sky.;2014-07-04 20:30:00;20 minutes;We were at the Laurel Lake watching the fireworks and a circular formation surrounded by lights appeared in the sky.   It hovered for several minutes, then the lights went out and it returned to the tree covered area behind us.   This formation happened several times with the lights disappearing and then reappearing getting closer and closer over a 30 minute period.   Although it was 5 of us there were hundreds of people who witnessed the same event ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Two small white lights moving erratically in the night sky.;2015-07-01 22:45:00;3 minutes;Two small white lights moving erratically in the night sky. When my family was driving in the car late at night, as we neared our house, I saw a light in the sky.  I thought it was an airplane at first, since my house is near an airport, but it didn’t have the pattern of an airplane’s lights, and it wasn’t moving like an airplane.  I spotted a second light a few seconds later as I was studying the first one.  My younger sister claimed to see the lights as well. The two lights were white and small, much like stars, and they were bobbing along in the sky, moving back and forth and up and down in an erratic fashion.  Eventually they disappeared into the clouds, and I saw the light patterns of an airplane following in their direction.;39.0991100877192;-76.843723245614
