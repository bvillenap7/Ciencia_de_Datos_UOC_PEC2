In the distance we both saw a bright light cross the sky horizontally then disappear.  To me, it looked like a sideways falling star, but brighter.  It was so bright and you cannot see stars in the daylight.  It disappeared into thin air.   Luckily, we both saw it, so I know I didn't imagine it.;39.0991100877192;-76.843723245614
