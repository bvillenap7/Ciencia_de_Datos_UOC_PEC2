Multiple bright objects in the sky like meteors.;2014-09-27 16:00:00;1 hour;multiple bright objects in the sky like meteors I don't want to sound crazy, I saw multiple very bright objects, much like meteors traveling very fast from the north to the south west sky, i did not hear any sound, the sun was too bright to follow them, some of the objects created something like a flying ribbon effect, there were airplanes flying nearby at a lower altitude than the objects, I did not have a camera to take pictures I really don't know what this is.;39.0991100877192;-76.843723245614
