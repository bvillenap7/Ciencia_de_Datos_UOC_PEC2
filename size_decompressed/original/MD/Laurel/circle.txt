I was walking my dog past the Maryland City Elementary school down the street from my house at approx. 6am.  As we were passing the school heading down Crumpton South, I noticed what appeared to be a planet sized orange/red object in the sky.  It was at about 40 degrees above the horizon (facing south/southwest). At first I thought it was mars or mercury, but it seemed to big to be a planet (appeared a little bigger than I have seen Venus). I kept walking while watching the object.  It appeared to become slightly bigger, so I stopped before I reached a group of trees that would block my view so I could see if it was moving like an airplane with its lights on.  It wasn't, so I started walking again and thinking about what it could be.  When I got past the trees to where I could see it again, it had changed from an orange/red glow to a single white light(much smaller), like you would see on a plane.  It blinked once, maybe twice, then moved in a quickly accelerating motion at approx 20 degrees up and to my left, out into the atmosphere. At it's fastest rate, it looked just a little slower than a shooting star.  I was looking south/slightly southwest the entire time.  It was still very dark, enough so to still be able to see all the stars in the sky. I was going to call the local airports to see if they noticed anything unusual on their radars at that time, but didn't think I could get through to the controllers, or whether they would give me the information if I could get through.  If you can get that type of information, I would appreciate you letting me know what they picked up on their equipment.  Thanks.;39.0991100877192;-76.843723245614
Bright light suddenly shrinking to small and going out.;2000-09-15 21:13:00;30 seconds;Bright light suddenly shrinking to small and going out. I had stepped outside to get some fresh air and noticed in the northern sky at a 45 degree angle a bright white light.  The light was steady and I thought as usual it was a plane from Balt-Wash Int. Airport.  So as I was going inside the house I looked again and the light had not moved in 15 seconds.  As I watched in amazement, the light suddenly became smaller and smaller, and suddenly as if a light switch was pulled, went out completely.  What kind of scares me is that someone else sent in a sighting to you 1 year and 1 day ago, and the address is right down the street from here on Crumpton South in Laurel, Md.  I kept looking and looking but nothing ever happened after that. ((NUFORC Note:  This sighting seems reminiscent to us of a sighting of a bright satellite.  As a satellite enters the Earth's shadow, it slowly fades from sight in a few seconds, just as this witness describes.  Just a guess, since we did not see the object.

There is a lot of air traffic here, so you get used to lights in the sky.  But this was different.  Dull red/white light, so hard to see you almost have to look to the right or left of it to see the light.  Sometimes brighter, then duller.  It took a good 5 minutes to go halfway across the sky, really slow for any plane or satellite.  I actually went back inside the house for 30 seconds, came back out and it was still slowly going from east to west.  This is where it gets really scary. Hear this.  A jet from BWI is heading in the same direction as this object. I thought to myself, could be a collision. Same direction, mind you.  As the jet gets within about 1/2 mile overtaking the object, it suddenly gets slightly brighter, then\ blinks out.  Just like that.  As if someone turned the light out.  I kept watching. the jet went directly past where the light would have been.  I stayed outside for a good 15 more minutes to see if I could see the light. Nothing.  Did anyone else see this?  Did BWI know about this??  What is going on in this area??????;39.0991100877192;-76.843723245614

round object above the trees;2011-10-28 00:00:00;10 minutes;round object above the trees I was talking to someone and I saw in the sky a round looking object. It was right above the tree tops about 100 feet away from where I was. It looked like it had windows and was yellow colored. There was a white colored dome on the top of the object. also there were a couple of flashing lights. It was not an airplane or a helicopter but was moving slowly near the trees then it disappeared;39.0991100877192;-76.843723245614

As I drove into the parking lot, I looked up and noticed 5 bright red circular objects floating from left to right. After 1 disappeared 3 more flew above the tree line and followed the other. Before I could video tape the sighting, 2 of the bright red objects formed 1 bright red object. All 8 objects disappeared 1 by 1!!!;39.0991100877192;-76.843723245614
