Bright objects larger and brighter than any planet or star in the sky at that time flying in a stretched out pattern, sometime 2 or 3 together, sometimes single objects.  All came from the north west sky from low on the horizon, traveling at the same speed and disappeared from view directly overhead.   When viewed from binoculars objects were red in color and appeared to be not steady but shakey as if they might be spinning.   Notably, there was no noise over the several minutes we observed the phenomenom.;38.9855877828054;-76.5062579185522
2-6 orbs of light intersect, then bounce, reverse direction, turn, then bounce again for >15 minutes.;2015-10-02 19:15:00;>15 minutes;2-6 orbs of light intersect, then bounce, reverse direction, turn, then bounce again for >15 minutes. On 2 October, 2015, I was sitting in my living room at about 7:15 PM.  I sat facing French doors.  The curtains were drawn and there was a clear view of the night sky.  I noticed lighted orbs “dancing”  in the sky.  I went outside to observe them more clearly.  Here is what I saw:  Two orbs moved across the sky.  They were heading towards each other then, once they intersected, they both headed back in the reverse direction.  Soon there were three orbs, then 4, then 5, then 6.  Again, the orbs would head in the same direction, intersect, then reverse direction (or “bounce”).  The number of orbs visible at any one time varied from 2-6.  The orbs stayed in almost continuous motion.  However, at times the orbs seemed to stop and hover in a loose pattern for a moment, only to resume the “bounce” activity.  I did not notice any distinct shapes formed by the orbs.  The only clear cut pattern was the “bounce” activity that remained consistent.  There was no noise in my area before, during or after the sighting.  I shot still and video photography with my I-Phone.  I managed to capture images of the activity as described above.  At one point, I asked my husband to observe the activity.  He observed it for a moment and was non-plussed.  After a few minutes, I suspended observation and went inside.  The orb activity continued for an unknown amount of time.;38.9855877828054;-76.5062579185522
Red, green, white, and blue lights moving across sky in Annapolis, MD.;2021-03-21 20:35:00;10 minutes;Red, green, white, and blue lights moving across sky in Annapolis, MD. While walking home with my wife from our parking spot, I happened to look up at the stars as it was a very clear night. I saw two lights moving together directly above us. One red and one green. They were moving in the NW direction. These were too far apart to be aircraft Nav lights and one slowly overtook the other. I stayed in the street watching them fade in the distance then looked back above the direction of our house to see about 10 more on the way. Colors included white, red, green, and dark blue or purple. Moving in same direction as the last two. Some overtaking others. No sound and solid colors. According to winds aloft data, these were not moving with the wind as far as I could tell. Took some cell phone pictures, but quality is terrible. Does show colors however. Called my family on Kent Island to step outside to look as well but they couldn't see anything similar to what we were seeing saw. The larger group of lights continued in that direction ! until they faded out of sight. Total time from for each group to cross over and dissappear on the horizon was about 5 minutes, so moving pretty good for a night with no breeze.;38.9855877828054;-76.5062579185522
