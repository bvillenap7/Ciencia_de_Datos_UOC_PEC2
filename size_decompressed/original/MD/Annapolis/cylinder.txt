White cylinders with fins moving over Eastport, Annapolis.;2011-06-13 20:00:00;fifteen minutes;White cylinders with fins moving over Eastport, Annapolis. Tonight around 8 pm, my wife and I were returning from a walk when I spotted an unusually bright white aircraft high against the blue sky.  It was cylindrical with two or three side-fins (far too small to be wings on such a large fuselage), it was moving northeast at a  rather slow rate and was neither making noise nor leaving a contrail.   Almost immediately I noticed two more such craft in the vicinity, though they were well spaced out in the sky, apparently at different altitudes, and possibly moving at different rates.   Over the next fifteen minutes, a neighbor joined us and we saw three more of them, each traveling individually, at different heights and speeds, but all of them traveling northeast towards the Chesapeake Bay.   I looked at two of them with low-powered binoculars and could verify more closely that they had no wings or tailfins, and no apparent markings, and they left no contrails.;38.9855877828054;-76.5062579185522
