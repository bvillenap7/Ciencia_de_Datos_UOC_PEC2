Thje sky was slightly overcast with high haze, moving west to east. Some stars were visable, including part of the big dipper. I saw a distinct crescent shaped form, moving from east to west.  There was no light, eratic movement or change.  simply a thin cloud-like C shape moving across the sky.  Had I not been in a reclining posture, I would not have seen it. The form went by rapidly, but not so fast that I didn't have time to comprehend  what was happening and concentrate on the object. Were I to hazard a guess, I would say that a black object was moving across the sky  and creating a pressure zone ahead of it's path.;38.9855877828054;-76.5062579185522

Then we both saw it from outside the 2 nd floor window.  It looked different.  It was in the shape of a bottle with two lines at the top end crossing over each other with circular lights at each end and then an almost identical shape, just smaller beneath the large craft.  It was white against the dark sky, or more like a translucent grey.;38.9855877828054;-76.5062579185522
Loud sound heard.;2015-08-26 02:00:00;4 minutes;Loud sound heard I was up at 2 in the morning and heard a loud noise that echoed through the neighborhood. It sounded like alien sonar over and over above me and lasted about 4-5 minutes.  I peeked through the blinds but was afraid to go outside.  It was a sound I have never heard but sounded out of this world.  I have searched the internet but have not found any similar experiences;38.9855877828054;-76.5062579185522
Large white flare with white trail.;2017-06-06 22:00:00;10+ seconds;Large white flair with white trail June 6, 2017.  Approximately 10 PM, I noted a broad white flair/streak heading NW over Annapolis, lasting 10 or more seconds.    The width was a little smaller than a full moon, and left a white trail that dispersed slowly.   It seemed to end about Â¾ across the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be unusually sincere and sober-minded.  He describes himself as holding a very responsible job in the medical field.

Tall ship;2020-07-10 16:00:00;0.02;Tall ship I was working on my hammock. I looked up and around 20 thousand feet maybe a few miles out I saw a massive white rectangular shape that was vertical over a cloud. It had a slight curvature.  It appeared for a split second then vanished.  Five minutes after the clouds above my house started heading in two opposite directions.;38.9855877828054;-76.5062579185522
