Looked like a firecracker;2011-08-11 23:30:00;5 seconds;Looked like a firecracker I just saw the weirdest thing fall from the sky.  It was bright blue and green and pretty large. It looked like a flare or a firecracker it was so bright.  I was looking at the moon.  Very weird no sound not a meteor not a comet really close and went straight down behind the trees  Really big and square with prongs on the bottom.  Very fast straight down with no sound.
