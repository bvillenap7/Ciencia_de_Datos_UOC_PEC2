Orb seen while driving Route 50 towards Annapolis;2007-04-14 11:00:00;20 seconds;Orb seen while driving Route 50 towards Annapolis I was driving down Route 50 East towards Annapolis, Maryland, and I looked up and saw this shiny orb floating in front of me.  I was roughly 4 miles from the Riva Road exit near Crownsville. It was a clear day, sunny and cold at 11:30 in the morning. The Orb was roughly 20 feet above the tree line, off to the right at about 20 degrees (or at 1:00).  It appeared to zip to about the 3:00 position in a split second.  I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me, so I got my camera out of my console and snapped a quick pick. The orb did nothing else but hover there in the sky.    I couldn't pull over at that time because there was a car to my right (as you can see in the picture) and my exit was coming up fast. Once I made my exit, I pulled over and got out, but it was gone.  This is too good to be true, I guess I can't get a better, second shot, I thought.  It's definitely not a weather balloon, because the way this thing moved and at the speed it moved, it's just not possible.  It all happened so fast, in the blink of an eye it was across the sky to my right.  The next thing I know, I check my camera and there it was, I had taken a decent pic of it thankfully.  I added a small red arrow to the first pic, otherwise, the pictures are unedited and untouched. Keep looking up...
