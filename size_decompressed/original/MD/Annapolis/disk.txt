UFO SIGHTED IN ANNAPOLIS OVER WEST ST.;2005-09-15 09:10:00;4 seconds;UFO SIGHTED IN ANNAPOLIS OVER WEST ST. I had just got in to my work and was  talking to my boss, i work at a car dealership, and i was facing south and through one of the show room windows i saw a metal object that based on the low cloud level did not look to be that large, i would say it was not more then 30 feet long and it was maybe 13 feet in hight. so it was flying low, it looked just like the ones that are on tv or ones you see people take pictures of like a silver disk. and it was not going that fast. no one else at my work saw it. but after like 4 seconds, in which i took a double take and realized what it was, it was masked by a building across the street and never reappeared. i am reporting this in hopes that some one else saw it and will report it ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Saucer shapped object with lights all around it in the sky in Annapolis;2005-12-12 19:00:00;10 minutes;Saucer shapped object with lights all around it in the sky in Annapolis There was a strange set of lights in the sky right above the tree line, that appeared to be moving slowly down (toward the earth).  There was a light in the center and decreasingly smaller lights on either side of the center light obviously wrapping around what appeared to be a flying saucer.  It sat still after I noticed it, then it slowly moved up and out of sight.  I've never in my life seen anything like it, I know it wasn't an airplane or a helicopter.;38.9855877828054;-76.5062579185522
Four silver objects in shifting formation over the Eastern Shore;2008-11-16 14:20:00;2-3 minutes;Four silver objects in shifting formation over the Eastern Shore I was crossing the Bay Bridge, heading east, when I saw four silver objects flying south over the Eastern Shore.  I guess their altitude was about 1,500 feet.  I thought they may have been fighter jets, but they made no noise and their flight patterns seemed rather irregular, almost as if they were bouncing around.  And the closer I got they didn’t seem to have wings but were perhaps saucer-shaped.  I tried to keep them in my sights as I drove.   After a little more than a minute they turned and headed back up the shore, towards the north. ((NUFORC Note:  Date indicated above is flawed.  We have assigned an arbitrary date above.

I was photographing several buildings with outside security lights. The night sky over the buildings was fairly dark.  When I began to edit the photos on 3/21/10 I noticed 3 images had noticeable light patterns in them. As I enhanced the lighting in each photo distinct shapes appeared. Photo # 1 had several orbs surrounding the top of one building. Photo # 2 has distinct saucer shaped objects with a beacon light on top.  The objects were departing the area appearing to bank to the right. Photo # 3. As the objects moved away from the sight they took on a bell shape.  Some were translucent blue, some were translucent maroon.;38.9855877828054;-76.5062579185522

Bright objects witnessed in the western sky near Annapolis.;2016-01-02 16:30:00;15 minutes;Bright objects witnessed in the western sky near Annapolis. We watched three bright objects slowly move across the western sky, one was significantly larger than the others.  The objects were glowing bright yellow/gold in the setting sun.  We could not tell the shape of the objects until a picture was examined to show a saucer shape.  The larger object had two metallic looking orbs appear to the right of the object.  The orbs moved along with the larger object then disappear after about 15 seconds.  All the objects continued west and were observed until out of site.  This observation lasted about 15 minutes.;38.9855877828054;-76.5062579185522
