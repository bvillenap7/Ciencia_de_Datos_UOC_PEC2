Someone said look a falling star I turned and saw not a falling star. All four of us watched this streek falling northwest for one minute. It was a thick tail of white or yellow sparkles. it stopped and left a smoke trail in a stright line after a short time it started to bend into a S shape as if it had crossed two different levels of wind currents. 5 min. latter the same streek appeared going the oppisite direction up and SE it went through the only small cloud in the sky spliting into two half circels with a line (its trail) going through it. Its trail also turned to smoke and slowly formed a s shape. The smoke dissipated in 15 20 Min. There was no sound, no object visible, no navlights. The moon came up 1/2 hour later.;38.9855877828054;-76.5062579185522

It was that close, at least it appeared to be.  I saw a fiery tail, traveling from east to west. It had a very gradual arc, as soon as it looked like it was going to hit and blow up, it fizzled out. I have never seen one this low in the sky!!!!!  The tail wasn't that long either like you normally see on a meteor.  Who knows, maybe it was something else.;38.9855877828054;-76.5062579185522
