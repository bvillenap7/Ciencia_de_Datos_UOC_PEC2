Suddenly an oval shadow caught my eye moving from right(NE) to left (SE). It was about 50 feet wide and 30 feet high.  The shadow flashed across the road in front of me then was clear as day on the brick sidewall of the overpass as it moved away at a speed of over 100 MPH.  I immediately assumed it was an airliner as Baltimore Washington International Airport is about fifteen miles away so I looked up in the air and their was nothing.  Since it was a warm day I had my window down.  There was absolutely no sound.  I thought that perhaps it had been a State Police Helicopter.  There was nothing and their Dauphin Helicopters have a distinctive sound. There was not a cloud in the sky.  There was nothing that could have made that distinctive oval shadow moving at a high rate of speed without one sound.  I am a US Air Force veteran and aviation nut so I pay close attention to anything that flies.  I have no explanation for this incident.;38.9855877828054;-76.5062579185522
Object appeared only a few miles from the Naval Academy in Annapolis, MD;2006-01-25 20:15:00;5 to 10 seconds;Object appeared only a few miles from the Naval Academy in Annapolis, MD I was standing in a school parking lot between 8:15-8:30 p.m.  I noticed an oval (round) object slowly drift out from behind a puffy cloud (it was a very windy evening, but a clear sky with a few puffy clouds).   The object was a bluish/grayish color, but not shiny.  The material looked like concrete.  The object was lit, but I could not tell where the lights were coming from.  It had roman-type arches all the way around it (which were lit up).  There was no sound.  The object moved at a very slow rate of speed.  I stared at it for a few seconds and it just disappeared.  The location of this sighting occured a few miles from the Naval Academy in Annapolis, MD.   If anyone else saw something that night, please post a sighting.;38.9855877828054;-76.5062579185522
