PD));2009-03-29 21:40:00;10 seconds;Flaming baseball sized object  fell quietly from the dark sky flamed out at 20 feet above water. From my 5th floor patio, I looked up just to see a flaming baseball sized shape quietly fall and flame out about 20 feet above the water before it hit in the water.  I did not hear any sizzle. It was a small object and quietly landed in the water.  The wind is causing mild ripples across the water and from our distance, it was not possible to detect an impact ripple. ((NUFORC Note:  Several reports of this incident.  Probable meteor?  PD));38.9855877828054;-76.5062579185522
Stationary light over Annapolis, MD;2011-04-09 00:15:00;10 minutes;Stationary light over Annapolis MD Looking out at night sky-some small planes-one light that I thought was a plane did not move.  Watched it for 5 minutes and since it didn't move thought it must be a star.   I got my binoculars and looked at it and it was a sphere-white greenish in color.  The strange thing was with my naked eye it appeared it had lights or glittering like a star but through the binoculars no light appeared.   It did not move after 10 minutes--then I went inside.  I have never seen anything like this in 51 years.;38.9855877828054;-76.5062579185522
