Strange metallic sound heard in the sky for 10 seconds;2015-12-19 21:00:00;10 seconds;Strange metallic sound heard in the sky for 10 seconds We didn't see any craft or object in the sky.  Me and two of my friends were outside on my patio smoking a cigar and just talking and out of nowhere this LOUD and strange sound just started ringing over the sky.  It's hard to explain what this sound was.  But it lasted 10 seconds.   It didn't sound like a plane or a rocket or an explosion.  It had a metallic sound to it.  We all just sat there in silence and looked at each other in disbelief at what we were hearing.  Never heard anything like this in my life.  Haven't heard it since.;38.9855877828054;-76.5062579185522
