Near a radio tower, and  I and the other 3 members of my family saw a bright flash of lightning coming from the front of the formation.  The objects then disappeared suddenly. 10, black objects triangular in shape, formed in the shape of an eye.;38.9855877828054;-76.5062579185522

I saw luminous triangles, flying in formation during the Leonid meteor shower;2001-11-18 04:45:00;5-10 seconds;I saw luminous triangles, flying in formation during the Leonid meteor shower I set my alarm for 4:30am on 11/18/01.  I was to meet some friends to watch the Leonid meteor shower.  After dressing in layers to ward off the chill, I stepped out onto my back balcony to see if I could see any shooting stars.  I saw three almost immediately.  I went in and excitedly phoned my friends - It was going to be great!, I said.  I stepped back out again, not wanting to miss anything.  I saw another shooting star, and then two large, luminous triangles appeared over the houses and trees from the north, headed south.  At first I related the illumination to the meteor shower, but when I looked directly at the objects an instinct kicked in that these were NOT stars, and I was witnessing something incredible. I live a block and a half away from the Naval Academy and I am used to Navy flyovers, Blue Angels, etc.  THIS WAS DIFFERENT.  The triangles did not project light to the ground, they themselves were yellowish, white light. Their edges were not sharp, they were slightly rounded with the glow of the light. The light did not fade or throb, it was constant. They appeared to be flying in formation - points facing down, close together, on a diagonal.  Together, they were about the size of a half moon. Their movenment was fluid and quick and they were SILENT.  My field of view is not very wide out my back porch, so I was only able to watch the objects for 7 seconds or so.  Soon after they disappeared from my view, I heard a boat horn sound twice quickly.  It occurred to me that maybe someone on the water saw the same thing, as the objects were headed in the direction of City Dock.  I met my friends on the back campus of St. Johns.  I told them I was pretty sure I had seen UFOs (a first for me, by the way) and quickly described my experience.  They reacted with friendly skepticism.  We were lying on a blanket, enjoying the wonderful meteor shower when I saw the triangles again in the southeast corner of the sky.  I sat up, pointed, and said Look!!!  There they are!!!  Thank goodness one friend was ! able to see them.  They were much farther away - about a third of the size they were before, and not as luminous.  They were now reddish orange in color and continued flying quickly in a southeast direction.  Just before they disappeared from our field of view, one triangle broke out of formation and darted ahead.  It was surreal. It seemed as though the triangles were animated - right out of a movie.;38.9855877828054;-76.5062579185522
Three luminous triangles flying in formation;2002-03-08 23:49:00;5 seconds;Three luminous triangles flying in formation I stepped out on my porch just before midnight.  I looked up and saw 3 triangular outlines of yellow white light, flying in a V formation from West to East.  They were silent, and very fast.  I saw similar objects on 11/18/01, and reported them on this website.  I am VERY curious and puzzled.  I live two blocks from the Naval Academy.  I hesitated to report this most recent sighting because I began to think that surely the Naval Academy is behind it somehow.  So far I have no confirmation.  Any help into the investigation of the matter would be greatly appreciated.;38.9855877828054;-76.5062579185522
A black triangle near the Naval Academy moved silently and would hover.;2003-10-06 20:12:00;2 minutes;A black triangle near the Naval Academy moved silently and would hover. I was driving east on Ridgely Ave in Annapolis not 100 yards from the Naval Academy.   Overhead to my left I saw a jet coming in the opposite direction from the area of the Academy.  I supposed it to be a commercial jetliner as there are many which fly in that path on their way to BWI (Baltimore Washington International Airport).   There were two white lights on either wingtip and one blue blinking one in the center as well as lights on the front.   It seemed to be flying rather low and unusually slowly, so I kept my eye on it.   When it slowed almost to a standstill, I knew something was not normal.  I broke my gaze just long enough to pull to the curb.   With the car in park I glanced over my shoulder and saw the craft just hovering in place.   Jets don't stand in one place or they'd drop from the sky, (Harriers excepted), and it was too large for a helicopter.   Besides I had the window open and it was completely silent.   I was able to look more carefully now and saw that the front end was well lit in fact the nose seemed to be composed entirely of glass panels reminiscent of some WWII bombers.   It was floating about a hundred feet up and was not large, maybe forty to sixty feet across.   I could not make out the exact shape, was it triangular, or fusalage and wings?   I did see that it was painted black.   I was straining to see if I could observe anything through the glass panels when it began to move again.   It floated slowly at first, perhaps ten miles per hour, then picked up a little more speed.   My window was open as I said, and it made no sound.   I started my engine and turned the car around in an effort to pursue the craft.   It was traveling exactly west in a straight line at level altitude.   The speed limit on the road there is 30mph, so it easily pulled away from me and disappeared beyond a stand of trees though it was not moving very fast.   It was out of view for a few seconds by the time my road went over U.S. Interstate 50.   I paused on the bridge and took a look down along Route 50.   There was no sign of it anywhere.   Had it turned north before reaching the highway?   That would mean it was over the Severn River.   I turned around again and went along my original route.   A minute or so later I was on the middle of the Naval Academy bridge which spans the Severn.   Again I looked, but the craft was no where to be seen.   I don't know what I saw, but my intuition tells me it was not extra-terrestrial, but one of ours, albeit using an unconventional form of propulsion.;38.9855877828054;-76.5062579185522
Dark object with red lights appearing to be that of a triangle;2012-07-04 22:30:00;6 minutes;Dark object with red lights appearing to be that of a triangle Large Triangle (appeared to be based on the contour of the lights) with red lights contouring each angle.   It was very dark evening with broken clounds relative humidity was high, what was unusual about the object was how slow it was moving (speed similiar to that of a blimp) and at a such a low altitude (less than 700 feet) moving east, pausing the continuing on east north east out over the bay.   At first we thought it to be a plane landing at Lee airport, however, it was moving outbound of the landing pattern, not to mention the size relative to any plane that would be able to land or take off from that airport.   My estimate would be approximately 150 yards in equal lengths between the red lights, which were 3 at each angle.   Of note, beside the slow air speed, the was absolutely no noise.

Driving in opposite direction, we turned around to view the object, red lights in lieu of the blue were seen when driving opposite direction.  Did not sound, look or fly like any other spacecraft seen, believe not military as other commercial planes followed minutes later thus the airspace was not restricted for it.  The object disappeared into the clouds within minutes, without a doubt we were not supposed to see this.;38.9855877828054;-76.5062579185522
