Observed a large triangle of three star-like lights moving noislessly, slowly and smoothly across the sky from due west to Due east.  Object was first observed at about 30 degress prior to 12-o'clock position. when it passed to about 20 degrees from 12-oclock it disappeared - total arc was about 50 degrees, each light quickly fading individually as it passed a certain star. - near Mars at that time.  The object occluded stars when it passed over them. We looked for further occlusion after it and none was observed.  Our assumption was a formation of planes - but as we are in Dulles flight path we are used to such craft.. this was not Dulles traffic.  The time and rural location would have made any sound audible.  There was none.;39.3516;-77.6533
