Please have someone prove me wrong!!;2017-01-30 07:00:00;hours;Please have someone prove me wrong!! I live near an airport and I see objects chasing and circling aircraft as they approach.  Shape hard to tell, could be round or oblong.  They have very dim lights, but are visible against the night sky.  I see so many, it's like an invasion.  Thankfully, no harm DONE.;39.2811999999999;-76.7406000000001
Brightly lit ship of varying  shape and colors.  ((NUFORC Note:  Object in photo appears to us to be Venus, possibly.  PD));2018-05-08 21:00:00;15 minutes;Brightly lit ship of varying  shape and colors.  Based upon my visual I believe it to be more than a quarter mile in  length . I have seen the ship on several occasions across from my home and it changes shapes from a triangle to a circle to an oblong and cigar shape.  It also changes colors and sometimes I miss blasts of different colors of red green blue and like a light purple.     I am attaching several photos taken this evening.      If it all possible I would like someone to contact me from your organization.   Thank you.;39.2811999999999;-76.7406000000001
