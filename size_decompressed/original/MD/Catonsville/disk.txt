I took pictures with my cell phone.;2017-08-21 14:40:00;2 minutes;I took pictures with my cell phone. During the eclipse, I snapped 11 shots on my cell phone, each picture within micro seconds of each other.  One of the pictures showed a disk shape image with a very bright white light on the center bottom. Other pictures taken showed a bright light in the sky.  This was not the moon!   The eclipse was happening at the time I snapped the photo, therefore, the sun and moon were overlapping which would have produced 1 image.;39.2811999999999;-76.7406000000001
