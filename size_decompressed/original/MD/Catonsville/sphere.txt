Round, silvery object floating over Catonsville MD.;2009-04-03 14:30:00;20 seconds;Round, silvery object floating over Catonsville MD. Yesterday in Maryland, the weather was gorgeous - bright blue sky, sun and gorgeous fluffy clouds. I stopped to take a break from painting my front step railings and just looked up at the sky. A very bright reflection immediately caught my attention to the south west.  I watched it to see what was so bright. The silver object appeared to be floating in one area with no movement from side to side or up or down. It stayed this still for about 25 seconds and made no sound. It was approximately a mile from my house but I could not begin to judge the altitude.  I realized that this was not an airplane or a helicopter because it had no shape other than round.  I changed my position to see if I could see another angle of the object but it still continued to look like a ball.  It was definitely NOT a balloon.  I was about to go into my house to get my husband so he could see the object, I turned from the direction of the object to go into my house then looked around one last time to see it, and in that short a time, it disappeared completely. I have never seen anything like this in the sky before. I am a 43 yr. old wife and mother of three sons.  I am a level headed, college educated artist and currently home school my 16 yr old son due to his chronic migraine condition.  My husband is a high ranking employee of the DOD.;39.2811999999999;-76.7406000000001
Orange spheres in the sky;2011-12-24 19:30:00;1-2 minutes;was driving in Catonsville near the Oella/Old Ellicott City area.  Witnessed three orange spheres in the sky in a sort of triangle formation.  The objects stood out distinctly from the stars and appeared to be lower to the ground.  I witnessed the first two slowly fade away while the other continued to travel slowly in the sky.  As it approached the North star it too faded away.;39.2811999999999;-76.7406000000001
