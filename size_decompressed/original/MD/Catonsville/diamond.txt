Large startionary diamond craft comprised of smaller dianond patterns/crafts within the larger shape,;2018-04-26 20:00:00;10 minutes;Large startionary diamond craft comprised of smaller dianond patterns/crafts within the larger shape, Saw a very large, bright light in the sky and knew it wasn't a planet or star.  It remained stationary and I could discern pulses of light emanating from different sides.   I ran in the house to get binoculars and could then see that it was a diamond shape and 6/8 smaller diamonds in white light within the larger object.  I was in awe and alerted my sister and two neighbors.  I snapped a few photos with my phone and the object then descended below the tree line.;39.2811999999999;-76.7406000000001
