Four Fireball-like Objects Flying in Formation Over Washington, DC Area   ((anonymous report));2016-11-05 18:10:00;2 minutes;Four Fireball-like Objects Flying in Formation Over Washington, DC Area Observed one, then two, then four white fireball shaped objects in formation.  The first appeared to hover very high in the sky, then three others appeared (from the right sky - perhaps were obscured by trees in my view).  I saw three similar objects in the Washington, DC, area on October 15, 2016.  They did not look like ordinary jets.

Three comet-like, high-flying, no-noise aircraft over Washington, DC.;2016-11-12 15:41:00;10 minutes;Three comet-like, high-flying, no-noise aircraft over Washington, DC This could be entered either as fireballs or formation.   My girlfriend and I observed three comet-like objects very high in the sky.  Bright white, no noise.  Not a normal jet contrail (was short and didn't dissipate or leave a trail), but looked like a bright white comet with a short tail.  There were three flying together--not close together, like military jets, but at a distance from each other.   This is the third sighting I've had of these things over the Washington, DC, area since October 2016.  My previous report is November 5, 2016. This perhaps could be the same thing as the UFO that flew over DC on election day November 9  - see Youtube.;38.9882907975461;-77.1267607361965
