Craft with 3 lights hovering over 495 then darting away;2003-01-21 22:55:00;5 minutes;Craft with 3 lights hovering over 495 then darting away Tonight while i was leaving work to go home at 10:55pm, i was in the parking lot unlocking my car door. I randomly looked up and happened to see a craft with three lights in a straight line with a blinking light underneath the object, so at first i would think this is a plane or what have you. but then i noticed it was just hovering near the 495 interstate. then the craft started to float to the right for a bit and then floated to the left. so i got in my car and see if i could get closer to the craft. when i got to the main road i paused to see if i could still see it. i looked as i saw it hover for a few more seconds,and then it darted away from me in unbelieveable speeds. let me remind you that i did not hear any noises, and usually when helicopters and planes are near i can hear some noise.  Also i reported a sighting on April 25, 2000 in these reports. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous.  PD));38.9882907975461;-77.1267607361965
