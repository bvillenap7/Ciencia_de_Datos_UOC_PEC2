However, as I looked to my right, there was another light exactly as the first one I notice.   I went back inside to get my wife.  She came out and saw the lights too.  The brightest of these lights were amazing.  They looked connected.  No sound at all and they never moved an inch.   I looked through my binoculars but the light was so intense I could not make out what they were.   I got in my vehicle to leave for work and looked back to the position of the lights..... Gone!  As if someone clicked a switch and turned them off.  This was not street lights. Really spooked me.;39.0715;-76.6963
