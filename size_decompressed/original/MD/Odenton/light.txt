I was on my deck looking up at the stars shortly after dark and noticed a light which appeared far out in space.It was just as big as the stars and just a tad dimmer, there wasn't a cloud in the sky and the atmosphere was clear as well. This light moved in a straight coarse for about 1 min then just dissapeared. I honestly don't think it was a jet or satalite, because I see many jets being that I live close to BWI airport and I would know the difference. This appeared  way out in outer space where jets don't fly and a satalite wouldn't suddenly just dissapear.Im convinced this was something other than a conventional aircraft.;39.0715;-76.6963
