2 Clockwise Rotating Lights around each other.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly an advertising or display light??  PD));2011-09-16 03:10:00;3 minutes;2 Clockwise Rotating Lights around each other. I wanted to report this because it seemed very weird. Took my dog out and saw 2 stars in the sky, they caught my eye because they were flickering more than the others, I thought at first they were planes.  But they weren't moving like planes do. The 2 stars were rotating clockwise around each other, until they reach a vertical line and just stayed there.  I checked after 10 minutes only 1 of the stars was still apparent. I tried to take pictures or video but my cam wasn't able to capture because of the darkness. ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly an advertising or display light??  PD));39.0715;-76.6963
