Two people witness high speed glowing sphere cross the sky and disappear;2008-03-30 03:10:00;3-5 sec;Two people witness high speed glowing sphere cross the sky and disappear My friend and I were traveling west on Interstate 70 about 10 miles east of Hancock MD and approximately 3:10 AM.  The sky was clear, the weather was chilly and slightly breezy.  There were no storm/rain clould in sight.  Directly in front of us in the sky about 45 - 55 degrees above the horizon, we noticed a very bright object moving toward the earth and incredible speed.  It was glowing with a yellowish hue, had no tail or coma.  It seemed to move toward the ground but we didn't see it go behind the tree line it just simply disappeared.  This was no aircraft I have ever seen, or my friend (who was driving btw).  I have seen meteors, comets, planets, and other celestial objects...this was neither of these.  Although it was only a few seconds in duration, I could tell immediately that it was out of the ordinary.;39.6969;-78.1765
