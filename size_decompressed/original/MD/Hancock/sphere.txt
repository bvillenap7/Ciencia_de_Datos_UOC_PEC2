The day was cold, clear and cloudless.  Time 11:30 am. Date 1-10-10. Camera Fuji FinePix S5100. While taking photos of an in flight C-130 I noticed a jet trail to the NNW and snapped a photo of it as well.  I routinely zoom in on the photos to see how well the photo came out and when I zoomed in on the supposed jet there is a perfect sphere emitting what had appeared to be normal jet exhaust.;39.6969;-78.1765
