Circular light flying low, not blinking and no sound.;2008-06-07 21:07:00;1.5 minutes;Circular light flying low, not blinking and no sound. The guys were working on the lawnmower and I was standing on the back porch. As usual I was scanning the sky. There was a circular non blinking light traveling from the northwest to the southeast about as high as a piper cub would normally fly.  We all saw it both with the naked eye and using 10-50 binoculars.  Even after dark (this sighting was at dusk) airplanes are distinguishable through binoculars and this remained a circular bright light.  It was traveling at approximately half the speed of a piper cub and there was no sound.  It wasn't a helicopter because they can be heard even from within the house.  Just before it went too low on the horizon to see anymore a small plane passed it.  The plane was obviously a plane.;39.6969;-78.1765
Light flying northwest over Hancock.;2008-07-18 21:50:00;< 2 minutes;Light flying northwest over Hancock. My husband and I saw flying very slow and fairly low over the town of Hancock a light headed in a north easterly direction. Seen through the binoculars I saw two lights but one object. I did not see a distinct shape. There was no sound, no flashing lights. My husband says it was sort of oval, but he saw it through the binoculars while it was closer than when I saw it. Just about 30 seconds after the object went over the town of Hancock there was a jet flying much much higher and in a south westerly direction.;39.6969;-78.1765
Star sized light stops and flashes very brightly, seemingly in response to a flashlight.;2010-07-10 22:55:00;7 minutes;Star sized light stops and flashes very brightly, seemingly in response to a flashlight. Saturday July 10, 2010 at approximately 10:55 pm EST myself and four other adults were outside enjoying the first cool night in over a week.  We were skywatching and we were pointing out satellites to the other couple and our grown son. I pointed to one in the western sky headed due north and at approximately 40 degrees above the horizon and had them watch it.  It was approximately the same size and brightness of the surrounding stars. My husband flashed his Ryobi flashlight twice at the satellite and it stopped  WNW of us.  It lit up about as bright as 20 or 30 stars. He again flashed his Ryobi at this light and again it flashed as brightly as the first time.  The flashes were approximately 15 seconds apart. While the others watched to see if it would move I came in and got the phone to call this in to NUFORC.  I took the phone out with me and the object was still stationary.  The position of the light was roughly 10 degrees south and west of  Phecda.   I could see it until 11:02pm EST when it dimmed out and was no longer visible.  We did not see it continue north. The visiting couple were scared enough to leave, which they did while I was still on the hotline. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and we found her to be exceptionally rational and capable.  We suspect that her description above is quite accurate.  Please see her illustration on our homepage.  PD));39.6969;-78.1765
Moving light responded to a flashlight;2010-07-11 22:55:00;< 10 minutes;Moving light responded to a flashlight We (my wife, my son, and myself) were talking to some friends (an adult married couple) that were visiting, and we were talking about lights in the sky because mutual friends told them we introduced these mutual friends to stargazing and satellite watching.  We all started scanning the sky to see if we could see any and pointed out a few satellites to our friends.  We saw a bright one come from the west to the east and disappear just east of directly overhead.  As our friends were getting into their car to leave we saw another light come from the south west headed north. We asked them to hurry up and look because this one was lower in the sky than the others we showed them were.  When the light was west of us for the heck of it I flashed my light at it twice.  I got an immediate response of a flash from this light. It went from a normal star sized light to almost a headlight sized light but very bright.   My wife immediately asked me to try it again and immediately it flashed again.  The time from the first flash to the second was no more than 20 seconds.   It stayed still in that same place for another 5 minutes and then it just vanished.  It was a little lower and west of The Big Dipper.  I never thought I'd get a response from the light.  I just did it for the heck of it.  It flipped everyone out when it responded, not once but twice.  I'd sure like to know what the heck it was.;39.6969;-78.1765
Object with flashing green and red lights seen darting across sky then hovering.;2014-09-23 21:18:00;current;Object with flashing green and red lights seen darting across sky then hovering. At approx. 9:18 pm my husband saw what he first thought was a shooting star.  It suddenly stopped and stayed still.  He got the binoculars out and noticed that it appears to be covered in green and red lights.  He had me go out and look and that is what it looks like.  My son could also see it from 8 miles away?;39.6969;-78.1765
