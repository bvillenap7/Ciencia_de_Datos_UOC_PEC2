Strange Green Light Spotted over Maryland;2015-09-11 22:00:00;25 minute;Strange Green Light Spotted over Maryland My brother asked me to come outside to see this green light at approximately 10:30 pm. We walked out front and down the driveway (we live on a small hill) and looked to the south/south west, roughly 45 degrees up.  At first glance we saw nothing but all of a sudden this dot in the sky roughly the size of a nearby planet or star began to turn from dark green into florescent bright green and shined brightly light green for roughly 5-10 seconds before dissipating once again.  The object did this randomly over the course of the sighting and as it did it slowly moved across the sky from left to right (from the viewpoint of looking south/ south west).  I saw the object 4 times however my brother saw it more than i had because he'd been outside looking at it prior to telling me about it.  After roughly 10 minutes after the last sighting we were not able to see it again and it never flashed again.  I wouldn't necessarily rule out that it was a lazer or satellite of some! kind but what baffles me is how vibrant green it was and how pin pointed it was.  In general we saw a dot roughly the size of a star turn vibrant green and then fade away into nothing, leaving us asking, What the hell was that?;38.5281;-76.9842
