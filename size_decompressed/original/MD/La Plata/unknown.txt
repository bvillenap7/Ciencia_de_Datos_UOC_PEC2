It was dark on top but on the bottom it looked like it was on fire moving very slowly from the left of 301 to the right. I drove to the north side of 301 to get a better look because it was now over the trees.  I would say the distance from the ground to the object was the distance that you would normally see a small plane fly.  The object came to a complete stop for a few seconds, about four cars stoped at that point.  Also I would say the size of it was about the size of a car.  It totally disapeared because of the trees.  I then drove south on 301 to try to find an open area without trees after that I did not see it anymore.  The estimated time frame of the sighting was about five minutes.;38.5281;-76.9842
