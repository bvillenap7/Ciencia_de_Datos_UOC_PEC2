Approx. 10-15 minutes later at 20:45 another object hit the South-Eastern atmosphere and lit up the night sky (as if a big lightning storm), left fragmented burning pieces around in the sky then as the object came towards the ground it had a large firey trail behind it that took about 2 minutes to dispate even though the object had obviously come down and hit the ground a distance away. At approx. 20:50 we spotted about 20 military helicopters flying in a semi-circular pattern above the general area that we were driving in and they were all maintaining a strict fixed line as if they were blanketing the whole area as to not miss anything. Having gotten home about 21:10 in Henderson, MD we called some friends and they too saw something like I just described- a trucker friend of mine saw it in Virgina and other truckers were reporting seeing in South Carolina, another friend saw it in North Carolina.;38.9693714285714;-75.8052571428572
