Hovering flashing lights over New Germany MD.;2012-08-23 22:30:00;1 hour;hovering flashing lights over New Germany MD. We were at New Germany State park near Grantsville MD.  It was a very clear night and this area has almost no light pollution at night. Its on the middle of nowhere.  We were standing on the rock dam at the end of the lake.  We were looking up at how good the stars were showing up when i noticed something very bright and changing colors.  It also was pretty much hovering at what i guess was maybe two thousand feet.  There is mountains in the area but it was well above those . We watched it for a good 25 minutes.  The entire time it never got any closer our further  away. Visually it appeared many miles away.  The odd thing was it did spirals then hover then zip to the right then stop.  From the distance away we were i think the speed of its movements to be of a very strange nature. I've been around all sorts of planes all my life a my dad was air force.  I've seen all sorts of planes pull crazy maneuvers.  This thing would just zip in a straight line and stop instantly.  finally i was positive i had just seen my first UFO. Trying to rule out things i would line up the lights which morphed from bright white to blue and red to trees.  This confirmed it really was moving like i thought it was.  During the time we were watching it we saw several planes fly over with lights flashing and it was  obvious those were planes. We went inside got the kids and brought them out.they saw it and after a few minutes went back inside.   Next day i looked for anything it could have been.  Nothing but open sky where it was. So i have no explanation for what i saw.  Maybe some new technology who knows.  It was cool nonetheless.;39.652;-79.1274
