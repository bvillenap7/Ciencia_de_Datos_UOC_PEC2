They were moving slowly up and then horizontally.  We stopped and watched for about 3 minutes. We then drove to Carrollton Rd. and turned left and watched from there.  They seemed to continue to move forward and up.  They seemed to dissapear as they went higher.  We could not tell how far away they were.  But they did appear to move with purpose. We had the windows open did not hear any sound at all.;39.6163;-76.866

Fireball like object spotted silently moving intelligently overhead, appeared to pulsate.;2019-01-27 22:30:00;~2 minutes;Fireball like object spotted silently moving intelligently overhead, appeared to pulsate. Spotted object moving from the northwest to southeast.  Thought it was a comet at first but it was moving far too slowly.  Altitude was higher than a helicopter but lower than a commercial plane.  Made no noise whatsoever.   Looked like a pulsating fireball, dimming and then brightening as it traveled.  Movement was intelligent.  Took about a minute and a half to two minutes for it to travel out of eyesight.;39.6163;-76.866
