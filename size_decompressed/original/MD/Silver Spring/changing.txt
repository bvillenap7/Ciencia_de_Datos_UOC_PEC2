Have you ever been abducted?   I have.  My story in detail.;2003-02-22 12:00:00;1 to 5 hr;Have you ever been abducted?   I have.  My story in detail. This is the truth though scary.  I was in my room grading my students papers when all of sudden I noticed a bright light outside my apartment.  I stepped outside to see what all what the comotion was when I felt a warm sensation come over my body.  The next thing I can remember is being alone on a cold hard table with people in Docter like masks above me. I can swear they were at least 8 feet tall.  They were slimy.  I knew this because they touched me in places I'd rather not share.  They stuck a needle in me but for some reason I felt no pain.  In the backround there were more people that appeared to be the female versions of the people.  The people talked in a foreign language that could not be understood.  It was a series of clicks and mumbled speech.  The room grew cold and I felt something being pulled out of me.  My apendix I believe.  Then I was knocked out once again.  I woke up right where this adventure had started.  I thought it to be a dream but then I felt the scar on my side. It looked as if someone had split me open with a machete. It was stitched closed as if a surgeon had performed the strange operation. ((NUFORC Note:  We have inquired whether the witness would be willing to have the scar examined, and perhaps photographed, by a physician, and whether she would like to meet with an investigator.
