There were lights on one object.;2013-07-23 18:10:00;5 minutes;There were lights on one object. Two objects were sighted moving fairly slowly against a hazy, early evening sky. They appeared to be oval in shape flying quite high and reflecting light as though silver in color.  I would have assumed that they were airplanes, judging from the altitude, but they were quite close together, and did not have the shape of planes.   They appeared to be flying much too high to be helicopters, and lacked a tail portion. At one point the rearmost craft appeared to have two circular lights, glowing almost like the headlights of an automobile.  These lights glowed for only ten seconds or so, then abruptly turned off.  The two craft were steadily gaining altitude and finally disappeared into the hazy sky.;39.0439912133892;-77.0272332635983
