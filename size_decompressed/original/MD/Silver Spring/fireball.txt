Falling object with strange green glow, like a meteor.;2007-11-08 22:00:00;15 Seconds;Falling object with strange green glow, like a meteor. This was more of an Unidentified Falling Object.  There was an object in the near distance, about 2 miles away from the sighting.  From that distance it looked like the size of a mid-size plane.  The object was round, looked sort of meteorlike, silverish with a large bright green glow surrounding the object.  There was a long tail of fire trailing behind it.   It fell within 10 seconds at an angle behind some trees and disappeared with no sign of explosion following,  I could not follow it.
