Red-Orange Fireballs in the Night sky;2011-08-02 22:00:00;1 hr.;Red-Orange Fireballs in the Night sky On August 2nd 2011 at approx. 22:00 I was in my back yard and noticed what appeared to be an extremely bright light traveling in a south easterly direction in the night sky.   The object appeared to be aflame and seemed to move like a small aircraft except there was no sound it look like a rotating spherical object as well. It was an overcast night and the object either went under the clouds or faded out.  About two minutes later another glowing object appeared and did the exact same thing.  I stood out and watched for about a half an hour as these objects kept traveling in the same direction, some solo, some in pairs, some in groups of three. I went up and had my wife and her sister and my nephew come out and see.  We stood and watched the objects for another half hour continue to pulsate and fly across the sky.  The object seemed as a fireball it seemed to rotate like a pulsar star as well   Attached is a picture unfortunately taken with only a cell phone camera.;39.0439912133892;-77.0272332635983
