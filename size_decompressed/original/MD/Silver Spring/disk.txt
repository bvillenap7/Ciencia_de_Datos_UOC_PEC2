It was less than a 100 yds from me, as clear as day. Saw a saucer hovering over the, then Hebrew Congregation on Lockwood Drive.  The saucer seemed to idle for a few minutes then it jetted off in a split second.  It was less than a 100 yds from me, as clear as day.  The saucer was your typical dull silver color with green lights circling the outer rim.  My cousin and I were both 13 the spring of 1977, I remember this day clearly, because we were getting ready to go for Easter Sunday Service and we were standing on the 4th floor balcony of the, then El Dorado Towers.  The Synagogue is approximately 100 yards from the building, at arms length the saucer appeared as big as a football field (100yds).  By the time I realized what was happening I told my cousin to run inside and get my camera, but the saucer disappeared in a split second.  My cousin and I couldn’t believe what had just happened, and being we were just kids we were afraid to tell our parents in fear of being labeled out of our minds.  Till this day we still don’t talk about the incident, because it freaked us out.  I remember telling my cousin that maybe they had heard us mention we were going to a picture, and they zipped off instead.  I think that we always felt as they had heard us, and therefore we were afraid of saying anything, in fear of getting abducted.;39.0439912133892;-77.0272332635983

It was flying UP and DOWN, From LEFT to RIGHT and it looked like it turned around itself (if that makes sense..) Going really HIGH and then coming DOWN again...;39.0439912133892;-77.0272332635983
