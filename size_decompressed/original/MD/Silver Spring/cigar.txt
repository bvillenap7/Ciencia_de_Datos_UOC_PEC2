Metalic cigar shaped objects passing over one another in Silver Sping Maryland.;2006-04-20 09:10:00;5 min.;Metalic cigar shaped objects passing over one another in Silver Sping Maryland. As I was riding the bus this Wednesday morning I noticed a bright metalic object out side the window.At first I thought to myself,it must be a plane.But as I looked closer I relized that I did not see any wings what so ever,no vapor trails and the object seemed to fly very slowly compared to that of conventional planes.The object headed to the east then suddenly stopped in mid air.I couldnt believe it.I said to myself no way was this happening,then a feeling came over me that had me think, what is this thing waiting for?I looked around and the only thing I saw was blue sky,there wasnt even a cloud in sight.Then out of no where I spotted a second metalic object just like the first only headed toward the west.Buy this point the bus had stopped to let off passengers.This is when I turned my attention back to the first object and relized that I was correct,it had stopped in mid air.Then to top that off the second oject flew underneath and past the first.It wasnt until this happened that the first object resumed speed and flew out of my sight.What a way to start your day...;39.0439912133892;-77.0272332635983

The craft, 12 of them, were floating very slowly, forming a rectangular cigar shaped formation, first 4 of them leading the other crafts, moving very slowly with 2 triangular shaped small crafts following the bigger cigar shaped rectangular formation with one craft guiding in the middle.   There was no sound around all these crafts.  The crafts looked clear and transparent with a larger crafts guiding some of the smaller crafts that also formed a triangle shape following the rectangular ones.  There was no beings in the craft.   The witness did not experience any abduction or sense of missing time, etc.  The light weight and transparency of the craft almost like a fabric, clear white, which made it suspect that it is a ufo not a drone. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and exchanged several e-messages with her, and she seemed to us to be unusually sincere and serious minded.  We suspect that she is a highly reliable witness, and has reported here honestly.  PD));39.0439912133892;-77.0272332635983
