I saw an white oval object in the distance, fairly high, over Kent Island/Stevensville somewhere to the east (right).  The object was hovering, was white, and seemed to shine.   As I drove across the bridge, it did not move.  I pointed it out to my passenger, who was also able to observe it.   However, it then suddenly vanished.  I kept a look out driving over Kent Island, but there was no sign of it, or any other object that could have been mistaken for it.;38.9368;-76.3471
