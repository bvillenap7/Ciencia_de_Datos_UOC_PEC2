Hovering triangular object near Chesapeake Bay.;2012-09-25 20:00:00;20+ minutes;Hovering triangular object near Chesapeake Bay. Sighting of something unidentified occurred Sept. 25 2012. Approximately 7:30 p.m. with a duration of at least 20 minutes. I was crossing the Bay Bridge (Chesapeake Bay) from Annapolis to Stevensville, MD.  Off to my right, hovering approximately over the south end of Kent Island, was a large triangular object.  I say large in that it was too large to be a helicopter.  The only other thing I could think of would be a blimp but could find no reports of a blimp in the area. That being said, I will give a description of what both myself and my husband observed.  Initially three lights in a triangle pattern (white) with a blinking red light on top.  In watching it, it seemed to rearrange, or turn, so that at some times the lights appeared to be straight up and down in a line, with the red light disappearing altogether, sometimes the red light would appear to be on the bottom.  It hovered in nearly the same area for an extended period of time indicating that it could in no way be a fixed wing aircraft.  It may have remained in the area longer than what we observed as we left the area and it was still there.;38.9368;-76.3471
