Bright stationary lights;2002-10-27 00:15:00;1 HOUR +/-;Bright stationary lights At roughly 12:15 a bright light was seen outside my window.  At first I thought it must be a helicopter with a spotlight.  Then I noticed there was more than one very bright light, three, maybe four.  I was suprised that the light was so bright, but I couldn't hear any noise.  I opened the window slightly, there was silence, only the sound of crickets.  I woke my husband up, he was amazed at the brightness of the lights.  We watched as the lights remained stationary for more than an hour.  We eventually fell back asleep.  When I awoke at 3:00am the lights were gone.;38.9368;-76.3471

These whitish orange lights hover side to side fairly low to the ground and ocasionally will get really bright and larger in size for small periods of time then they go back to their reg. size and whitish orange color. They hover for such long periods of time at first glance they look like a light off a tower or a star but after longer observation you find that they kind of hover side to side. We thought they might be helicopters, just when you think that they move in a way or get really big and bright. I have no idea what we are seeing but we see them on a reg. basis at least once a week. Helicopters are the only thing that I can come up with but they look really weird.;38.9368;-76.3471
Beight glowing lights sitting starionary for 15 minutes then moving off slowly. completely silent.;2012-07-27 00:10:00;15 minutes;Beight glowing lights sitting starionary for 15 minutes then moving off slowly. completely silent. I left work at the local grocery store on Kent Island at the same time that leave every night.  At a stop light on my way home on the access road out front as I was sitting at the intersection of ft 8, I looked to the left and saw 4 bright glowing lights sitting over the road about a mile down.   I have never seen anything like it before and was so shocked I called a coworker to ask her if she saw it.   They were completely still for at least 15 minutes as I sat and watched them and took pictures.  I went home and told my husband who told me he just heard on the radeo this morning that this was the 60th anniversary of the 1952 sightings over DC and MD.;38.9368;-76.3471
White ball of light with bluish purple lights on the sides.  Made no noise.;2018-10-04 20:00:00;4 minutes;White ball of light with bluish purple lights on the sides.  Made no noise. I watched a white ball of light about 1000 ft off the ground come from the north east to the south west.  The ball was about 10 to 15ft round and had bluish purple lights flashing off the  sides of it.  It made no sound and we watched a passenger plane flying around 10,000 feet fly over it and we could here that plane but couldn't here this ball of light.  The next night I watched the same exact light fly the same path.   I've lived here for 35yrs and planes fly over all the time and this was something different!;38.9368;-76.3471
