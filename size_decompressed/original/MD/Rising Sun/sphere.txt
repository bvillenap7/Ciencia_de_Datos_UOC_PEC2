They were all spherically shaped except the upppermost, which was shaped like a classic child's top.  They were all self-luminescent, and the appearance suggested some type of connecting, luminous cord.  All objects gave off a bright glow, similar to the glow given off by adjacent, moisture-laden clouds reflecting the bright sunlight.  The bottom sphere seemed to be smaller than the middle two, and, as stated before, the uppermost was shaped like your classic spinning top.  These objects would have never been detected had I not deliberately looked up.  I went in the house-they were first observed from my front porch-to get a camera.  When I returned, they were gone.  They were observed by yours truly, my wife, and eldest daughter.;39.6882;-76.0492
Bright white sphere on Sylmar Road;2004-02-15 21:39:00;10 seconds;Bright white sphere on Sylmar Road Was driving south on Sylmar Road, off to the left over a field saw bright white light about 45 degrees up on the horizon.  It was sphere shaped and forming about a quarter of a mile from my car.  Ball of light intensified and seemed to be getting larger.  Then Sphere dove straight for the ground at very high rate of speed and then sharply reversed course in an arching pattern.  Sphere continued upwards and disappeared behind cloud cover. I stopped at intersection of Slymar and Rt. 273, for few minutes but saw no further sign of the object. Absolutely did not resemble any aircraft or any other natural phenomenon I have ever seen.  I was close enough to get a good look at it. It was an enlightening experience to say the least. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));39.6882;-76.0492
