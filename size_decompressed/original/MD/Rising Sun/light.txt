AT NIGHT 5 OR 6 LIGHTS FORMED A CIRCLE, DESENDED, THAN LIGHTS WENT OUT;2011-03-03 20:30:00;2 to 3 mins;AT NIGHT 5 OR 6 LIGHTS FORMED A CIRCLE, DESENDED, THAN LIGHTS WENT OUT MARCH 3, 2011 8:30 - 8:35 PM  LOOKING EAST FROM THE INTERSECTION OF RT 272 & RT 273 IN CECIL CO. MARYLAND, JUST EAST OF RISING SUN, MD.  I SAW 5 OR 6 LIGHTS THAT FORMED A CIRCLE, POINTED AT THE GROUND. I COULD SEE NOTHING ELSE BUT BLACK SKY. I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG THE LIGHTS WERE THEIR. I WAS JUST LOOKING AROUND AND THAN LOOKED IN THAT DIRECTION AND SAW THE LIGHTS.  ONCE I NOTICE THE LIGHTS, I NOTICE THEY WEREN'T MOVING AWAY FROM ME, NOR MOVING TOWARDS ME, OR TO THE LEFT OR RIGHT. THEY WERE COMPLETELY STATIONARY. THAN I NOTICE THE CIRCLE OF LIGHTS WAS DE SENDING. THIS LASTED FOR 15 TO 20 SECONDS. THAN THE LIGHTS WENT OUT. I WOULD SAY THE LIGHTS WERE 500 TO 800 FT OFF THE GROUND AT THIS TIME.  WHEN THE LIGHTS WENT OUT THE SKY WAS ALL BLACK, THEN I NOTICE IN THE AREA WHERE THE LIGHTS WERE A SMALL FLICKERING LIGHT. THAN I NOTICE ABOUT A 100 YARDS CLOSER TO ME TWO MORE SMALL FLICKERING LIGHTS. BUT IN 2 TO 3 SEC. THEY WERE GONE, LIKE SOMETHING CAME BETWEEN THE LIGHTS AND FIELD OF VISION. THAN I NOTICE THE FIRST LIGHT I COULD STILL SEE AND THAT IT WAS MOVING NORTH SLOWLY. I WATCH FOR ABOUT TWO MORE MINUTES TILL IT WAS OUT OF MY FIELD OF VISION .;39.6882;-76.0492

I was walking my dog in the back yard, when I happened to look up and noticed a series of flashing lights in the sky over the farm across the road.  It appeared to be a central white light with faint red lights flashing in a random pattern around it, I observed the lights for approxamitley twenty minutes it remained stationary for the entire time before seeming to fade away.  I am a grounded college educated individual with a background in history.;39.6882;-76.0492
