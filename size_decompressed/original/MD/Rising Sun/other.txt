We saw a cluster of lights flashing in the distance. It seemed to be stationary. We were driving east bound on Rt. 273.  Thought it may be a hellicopter, but as soon as we decided it was probably a hellicopter, suddenly there was a bright head light.  It started coming toward us as we were still driving.  It was heading west down Rt 273.  It was going at a slow speed and seemed to be getting lower.  Maybe the height of 1 1/2 telephone poles.  I got the feeling that it may hit us.  All we saw at this point was the head light coming right to us.  It finally flew over us.  We got a look under it.  I didn't see any landing gear.  It was light gray or white.  The shape was a rounded rectangle.  My son described it as being more rounded.  He got the best look at it and said that it was something he had never seen before.  There was NO sound either.  Which was something we didn't realize until a few minutes later.  I called the  Rising Sun Police department when we got home to see if any one else had reported anything strange.  The person I talked to said that she saw a cluster of lights and thought it was just a plane.  It wasn't plane lights.  There were too many lights.;39.6882;-76.0492
Trapezoid shaped object with 4 lights, 1 flashing, and no sound.;2015-01-15 20:00:00;5 minutes;Trapezoid shaped object with 4 lights, 1 flashing, and no sound. I was on my way to work, and I noticed in the distance 2 bright lights that seemed to move together.   By the time I reached the end of the road I saw 4 lights.  It was almost above me and I could see a trapezoid shape and 1 of the lights was constantly flashing.   I got out of my car and for as close and as low as it was I should have heard it.  I heard nothing of any known aircraft.   I watched it for about a min outside of my car.   Then decided to try to follow it.  I only got about a mile or 2 down the road and it was well out in the distance fast.   I did try to film it but only got a dot on my screen.;39.6882;-76.0492
