BLUE FLASHES, LIEK CAMERA STROBE, IN PASADENA SKY EARLY TUES.AM/3:30AM/8.30.11;2011-08-30 03:30:00;7 to 9 seconds;BLUE FLASHES, LIEK CAMERA STROBE, IN PASADENA SKY EARLY TUES.AM/3:30AM/8.30.11 Very early on the morning of 8.30.11, around 3:35am, I saw the same flashes someone in New Carrollton MD saw back on 6.24.11 at 3:00AM.  What struck me is that the individual who posted their description saw word for word exactly what I saw.  That person wrote: “Set of sky flashes lit up entire sky with out any radar anomaly or storm...It looked like the whole sky took a picture, for what seemed like seconds there were two sets of flashes with a pause between the two….There was no sound or bolts of lightning, nothing on the radar, just looked like someone with a really huge planet sized camera took a picture of our planet with flash….flash was bluish- white and looked exactly like a camera flash…”<- Okay, the only difference in that person’s experience and mine is that after I saw the blue flashes, there was a very brief red flash, just one, but it was almost as bright as the blue flashes. This is not he first time I’ve seen anomalies in that area of the sky he! re in Pasadena this is the 4th time in 5 years we’ve lived here that other-worldly objects make themselves seen to us.  We’ve also seen the same red/orange orbs someone else here in MD described, floating down our street moments after a terrible electric storm in June 2010.  My husband had the presence of mind to grab the camera and have me take pictures.  I chased them down the street until they floated up over the tree line and out over the waters of Stony Creek.  In any event, the encounters have been more frequent and varied, i.e., we’ve not been limited to just one type of experience since moving to Pasadena, and after seeing those huge flashes in the sky last night, I can honestly say I’m uneasy and really want to take the photos to an expert and have them analyzed, but I don’t know to whom I should forward the photos. I didn’t get a photo of the flashes last night, but I have plenty of the other photos….;39.1244;-76.4949999999999
Mega flash of pure white light.;2013-02-09 02:50:00;2 seconds;Mega flash of pure white light. extremely powerful flash of pure white light that filled the entire sky and illuminated all surrounding areas.  No lightning or storms present that nighr.   One flash that was similar to a mega camera flash or some sort of energy bomb that lasted an entire second and was followed by a smaller flash around a bright white ball that quickly shot up into the sky.  I have seen many storms throughout my life but this was completely un-natural and completely unexplainable...  I would compare the energy released to the first light emmitted from an atom bomb.
