It was in the eastrern sky.  A formation of about 10 crafts. formations within formations diferent colors in each formation. I had just gone out to play with my friends when I noticed some lights in the sky. I told my friends to look and we saw 10 lights. The first 4 were in a diamond formation and gold in color with the lead object traveling North eastward. The next 4 were in a square formation and were redish in color.  The last 2 were bluish and were in a straight line traveling the same direction as the rest North eastward. For a couple of seconds they all stopped moving, then after a second or two more each group split off in a different direction and were gone.  The whole event lasted only for a about a minute, but I looked down at my watch and nearly 20 minutes had passed. After I asked the rest what time they had we relised that all of us had lost about 20 minutes. I'm 30 now, 20 years later, and I can still see it in my mind like it was that warm sumer night. It still scares the hell out of me.;39.1244;-76.4949999999999

12 objects, with reddish orange lights, low in the cloudy sky on Christmas Eve;2014-12-24 19:20:00;10 minutes;12 objects, with reddish orange lights, low in the cloudy sky on Christmas Eve What we saw on Christmas Eve:  It started with two reddish orange lights, side by side, moving low across the cloudy night sky.  The objects were moving from southwest to northeast.  They were well below the clouds and they made no sounds. As we stood watching those two, 6 more appeared behind them, flying in what appeared to be a Z formation. The lights were the same color on them.  As we watched those move across the sky, two more appeared behind the Z formation. These were seen from the front of the house and we went out on the deck in back of the house and spotted two more, following a different path of the 10 others, a little further to the north.  These two disappeared into the cloud cover after passing over the house. Could possibly have been drones, but there were so many of them.;39.1244;-76.4949999999999
