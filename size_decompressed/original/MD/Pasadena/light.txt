It was 5:30 a.m. July 17, 2006 and me and a friend were standing in his back yard. We saw a light just above the horizon where the sun was coming up...there were no stars in the sky because the sun was rising, but this stayed visable, so we examined it for a while...we kept seeing multiple flashes around the area of the light, so we continued to watch and see what was going on...after about 30 mins i saw what i would say was a wave of energy come from the light, it was in the shape of an arch and was colorfull, and i felt that something big was happening, for a few second i actually feard for my life...just after this small burst i saw multiple objects shaped like J's turned 90 degrees to the right, coming from the direction of the light...they appeared very small from where we were, but they were within the atmosphere...we watched as they went in seperate directions across the sky...after we could no longer see the small objects, we continued watching the light... after a few minutes, the objects returned from the direction they had gone in and were heading towards the light...after a minute, we no longer saw the objects and the light began to fade until we couldn't see it anymore...ever since this event occured about 17 hours ago, the sky has felt much more occupied than before, i can't shake the fealing that w/e i saw is still present...;39.1244;-76.4949999999999

On the morning of 10/18 /11 between 600 & 630 hrs I saw a bright object shoot across the sky.;2011-10-18 06:00:00;1-2 seconds;On the morning of 10/18 /11 between 600 & 630 hrs I saw a bright object shoot across the sky.  The object was much larger than a star, was very bright and had no color and had no tail like a comet. It did not move as fast as a shooting star.  I observed the object at about a 60 degree angle moving in a SSE direction. Due to large tree I could only see the object for 1 or 2 seconds.;39.1244;-76.4949999999999
Three UFOs seen in Maryland 8:12pm est two orange glowing orb shapped one cigar shaped.;2014-02-15 20:12:00;1 minute;Three UFOs seen in Maryland 8:12pm est two orange glowing orb shapped one cigar shaped Driving back to work after making a delivery I saw 3 UFO’s.  Two were south east of me.  They were one orange glowing ball shaped light and the other was a little different.  It was also a light but wasn’t just one glowing ball, I can’t quite remember how to precisely describe that one.  It was more like a cigar shape maybe.  Both were close to each other and appeared to be hovering or slowly descending a few hundred feet to a few thousand feet in the air approximately a mile to a few miles away from me over what I would guess to be near Gibson Island or so.  The third one was another orange glowing ball or orb shape at approximately the same height and hovering or descending in a similar manner.  It was to the east of me.  If I had to guess I would place it near Curtis bay area or Dundalk.  Saw for approximately one minute until there were below the tree line and no longer in sight and I had to drive back to work.;39.1244;-76.4949999999999
