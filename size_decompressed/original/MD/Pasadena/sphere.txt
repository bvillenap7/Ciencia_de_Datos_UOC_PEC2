At least 36 bright white illuminated moving objs in a straight, but highly irregular spaced line,  SW to NE.  ((Starlink satellites));2020-03-26 05:45:00;5-8 minutes;Observed at least 36 bright white illuminated moving objects in a straight  but highly irregular spaced line moving from SW to NE. On 03/26/2020 I observed at least 36 spherical brightly illuminated objects in a very straight line moving across the sky (approx from 240 degrees to approximately 60 degrees) at approximately 0545. THEY WERE ALL MOVING AT THE SAME SPEED BUT VERY IRREGULARLY SPACED, SOME IN CLOSE GROUPS FOLLOWED BY OTHERS.  I had a somewhat obstructed view and my phone was in the house but it was a very strange and unexplainable sighting.  They were not planes and there were no blinking lights that I could see.  They were spaced irregularly but absolutely in a straight line.  For someone who had a 180 unobstructed view it had to be much more striking,they probably saw a broken straight line from 240 degrees to 60 degrees.  I have seen what I believe are satellites that look similar but there is no way there could be that many satellites in the same line at approximately the same time in my opinion.  I reside close to Baltimore Washington Airport and there was 1 plane preparing to ! land and at that time of the morning I'm sure there were some preparing to take off.  I believe this will be a well documented sighting as it lasted a long time, the sky was clear, visibility at ground level was excellent, no moon and lots of unusual and bright movement.  Many people would be going to work even though COVID19 has caused a limited the number of cars on the road.  I HAVE NEVER BEEN EXCITED ENOUGH TO REPORT ANYTHING IN THE PAST.  I would like to know what happened and how many other observers there were.  I don't want to be put on e-mail list that would sink a battle ship.;39.1244;-76.4949999999999
