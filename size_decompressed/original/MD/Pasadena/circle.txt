Orange object with white streaks observed near BWI airport.;2013-10-13 19:45:00;1 minute;Orange object with white streaks observed near BWI airport. On Sunday 10/13 at approximately 1945 Hrs.  We observed what appeared to be a fire ball in the sky traveling at the same speed as an airplane.  The fireball was bright orange and had two white streaks behind it.  We live approximately 10 miles from BWI airport and the object was lower than planes which were in the area.  The ball was descending in an approximate 20% decline and was traveling from west to east.  As the orange ball passed our location and came upon a tree line we could see a large plume of smoke in the sky and the object was no longer observed.  The smoke just dropped stright down in a denseness that almost looked like a black parachute coming down to the ground.  The object made no sound whatsoeve and was smaller than a large passenger carrier but larger than a military jet.   The object was observed by two ther neighbors and one was actually able to take a picture for which I am trying to retrieve and email same.;39.1244;-76.4949999999999
