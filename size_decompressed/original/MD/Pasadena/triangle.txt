I saw a triangle as I was playing in my yard;2012-06-30 12:00:00;~1 Minute;I saw a triangle as I was playing in my yard I was playing with a inflatable beach ball in my backyard when I was 10 in 2012, and then I looked up at the sky in the northern direction and there was a distant triangle just sitting there about 100-500 feet off the ground..  It was in the shape of a triangle and the color was black.  I could see that it had multiple lights on it.  There was only 1 visible triangle.  So I ran inside freaking out and I got my father.  When he went outside,  It was completely gone!  There wasnâ€™t even a trail that it could make as the weather was sunny.  Then, I never saw the triangle again.;39.1244;-76.4949999999999
Very bright no sound shaped like a triangle.;2017-02-11 15:00:00;2 minutes;Very bright no sound shaped like a triangle I looked out my living room atrium doors.  Over the Patapsco River, entering into the Chesapeake Bay, I saw what appeared to be the brightest star I ever seen.  I watched it and it slowly moved toward my house.  The light then turned at Fort Smallwood Park and went over my home.  When I looked up, it was a triangle shape with brown underneath with one bright bright light on the back.  It seemed to moved very smooth.  There was no sound what so ever.  It looked like the size of an airplane.;39.1244;-76.4949999999999
