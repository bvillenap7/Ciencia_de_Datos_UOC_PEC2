My daughter and I were watching about 50 crows in the big tree beside our house, when suddenly, I saw something that looked like a great big pale white cigar.  It came out of the eastern sky, flying about as low as an airplane, but it didn't have wings.  It did not have a tail, and it was very fat. I ran in to get the video camera, and began taking footage.  It looked somewhat smaller, and went behind a cloud, then shot straight up.  Some of the video footage shows it kind of flatening out and disappearing, then coming back to the cigar shape. I am 43 years old.  My daughter is 8.  We are homeschooling Christians who value truth and honesty.;39.1244;-76.4949999999999
