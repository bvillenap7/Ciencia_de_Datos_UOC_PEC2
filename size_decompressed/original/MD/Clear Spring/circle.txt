Hugh bright light, Very fast..;2013-07-26 22:00:00;10 seconds;Hugh bright light, Very fast.. The sky was very dark with minimal stars.  You could clearly see it had a circular shape but it had a bright glow around it.  It was about half the size of how the moon normally looks in the sky and it moved very quickly.  As soon as I pointed it out to my mom it slowed down and slowly shrank in size and completely dissipated into the clouds.  We thought it might be a low flying airplane and waited for it to reappear on the other side of the cloud but we never saw it again.  Almost immediately after ,though, there were two very fast Airplanes that kept flying around in that very area.  They stayed for about 5 minutes or so. My mom and I have never ever seen anything as crazy as that before,  I can't put a finger on what I might have been.;39.6678;-77.9061
