4 bright round balls of light in a diagonal line.  ((anonymous report));2017-09-24 16:30:00;3 seconds;4 bright round balls of light in a diagonal line While walking outside to do farm chores just after dusk, I happened to look up at the sky, as I usually do, to look at the moon or passing aircraft.  At that exact moment when I went to look back down a flash of white caught my eye and I saw 4 round balls glowing bright white, like a LED bulb in brightness. These lights were in a diagonal and were just above the horizon and shot straight down and disappeared. A house in the distance obscured whether they reached ground level.  They appeared suddenly in a 4 orb pattern then extremely fast they went down and disappeared.  I continued to see normal planes flying high with normal lights but this was definitely different. I have seen shooting stars and meteors, but this was completely different and larger. So in conclusion...4 bright lights in a diagonal line moving extremely fast downward at angle.  Just after dusk.  Looking at the southern sky.  No clouds, no storms, no lightning.  Just regular sky with passing airliner traffic and suddenly 4 bright round lights.  Lasted 3 to 4 seconds at most.  No time to even grab the phone for video. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));39.5169;-77.1064
