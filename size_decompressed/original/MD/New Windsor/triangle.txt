It was before dawn, and I was sitting by a tree, bored and looking up at the sky.  It was a clear morning (plenty of stars).  First I saw an airplane go by, lights flashing, and I followed it until it disappeared over the trees.  Maybe a minute later, in the North portion of the sky, I saw a slow, very visible object.  The object was shaped like a pyramid, and was lit up with large, round blue lights all along the bottom (one light at the front, two in the middle, and three along the rear).  I couldn't see the sides, but  red lights glowed enough to give them definition, and it left a faint red trail.  The object took its time going by, and made no noise at all.  It also, for some reason seemed to be very high, but very large.  It kept moving in a straight line and disappeared beyond the tree line.  Later I asked my Dad if he had seen it, and he said he hadn't. At that time I was around 15 years old.  I remember it clearly now, 15 years later.  I have watched those UFO specials hoping to see something like what I had seen, but never have.  I have not seen one like it since. I am a college graduate (a B.A. in english), and I work as a department manager at a local music store.;39.5169;-77.1064
