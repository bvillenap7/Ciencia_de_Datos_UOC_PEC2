My wife and I along with a friend of ours went out to a field in Fruitland to watch the launch of a military defense rocket from NASA's facility at Wallops Island, Va.  We are located about 30 miles to the northwest of the facility.   The original launch time for the rocket was 23:09 and around 22:04 we noticed a very bright light in the sky above us, nearly directly over head.  It appeared to be 10x larger then any other star in the sky, we could not make out anything other then just a bright light.   The object was moving due east while traveling what appeared to be no faster then a small plane.  No noise was present and no lights were flashing just one solid white light.   The object begin to appear to slightly change to a orange/white color as it slowly faded then after about 5 seconds faded into complete darkness.  It was still in what was a clear sight of view but just faded into complete darkness.  We then learned the rocket was delayed untill 23:09, and we stayed to watch the launch.   We didnt see anything else the rest of the time untill the rocket launch, which I have to say was an amazing sight.   We have no idea what the light that we saw was, but it left us wondering what we had just seen. ((NUFORC Note:  International Space Station over-flight.  PD));38.3155;-75.6197
