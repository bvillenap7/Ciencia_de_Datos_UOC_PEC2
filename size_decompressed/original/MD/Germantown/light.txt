2 bright moving stars dogfighting!;2005-08-01 19:30:00;20 seconds;2 bright moving stars dogfighting! It was a clear night in Germantown, Maryland, about 7:30 pm on August 1, 2005, my birthday.   The sky was a light blue and I could see the stars starting to show.  I was on my cell phone talking to my friend on the back deck of my townhouse.   That’s when I noticed 2 lights up in the sky that looked like bright white stars.  But they were moving, and the speed that they were moving was unbelievable.  It was like they were chasing each other.   For about 20 seconds, I started to describe everything I was seeing to my friend.  It was like they were playing with each other, like a dogfight.  Darting in and out of each other’s way.  Then one took a hairpin turn and the other followed.  The one that was being chased just disappeared.  Like someone turning a light off.  The light that was chasing it passed the point of where the first disappeared, and then it as well disappeared.  I couldn’t see anything after that. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length via telephone with this witness, and she seemed exceptionally bright, sincere, and credible to us.  Her view of the objects, apparently, was very good.  PD));39.146164516129;-77.272935483871
White orb of light that rapidly ascended;2012-09-17 06:15:00;1 minute;White orb of light that rapidly ascended At 6:15 AM, I was walking past the loading dock, on my way to work at a new construction sight at QAIGEN in Germantown, Md. and as I left my company trailer, I witnessed an orb of white light approaching just over the tree line from the south.  It sort of wobbled a bit as it moved so it caught my attention.   I deceided to monitor it just for a bit as it continued heading toward me.  It was moving slowly so I walked a bit (had to get to work), as I walked, I turned to walk East past the loading docks to where the construction sight is, and it turned to parallel my direction.   Still moving very slowly.  It was now past the trees and high enough up that I had full view of the object.  I never once noticed any sort of strobing lights to identify it as either a civilian or military aircraft.   The light stayed constent no matter what direction I was observing it from.  Anyway, as I walked, it gradually moved past me (second witness saw it at this point).   Shortly after it moved by me it started to ascend at about a 12 degree angle and rapidly moved away until it was just a pin point of light in the predawn sky.  It only took about five seconds for it to move this fast.   I never heard any sound of jet engines or rotor wash from a helicoptor and like I said before, there was only ever a white orb like light with no aircraft strob lights.;39.146164516129;-77.272935483871
