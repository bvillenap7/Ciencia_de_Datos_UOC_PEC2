Unable to move encounters of a 4th kind;2011-02-22 01:45:00;10 minutes;Unable to move encounters of a 4th kind   I fell asleep at 1:15  I usually sleep on my tummy but I slept on my back today I knocked out I woke up but I could only open one eye at a time.  I opened my right eye and just saw my fan and a flash of light, I opened my left eye and could see my tv on ( note that I had left it on) it had the flash in the back too.   Afterward I try lifting my body uprise and I couldn't I felt a numbness and I couldn't move at all I headed unexplainable voices to my right ear and I could react I couldn't even panic, furthermore I could here like a blender sound or a hovering sound I was scared.   I tried opening my eyes again and I couldn't once the noise started to fade my body started to de paralyze.  I also remember feeling cold feet and I had positioned it a certain way when I was able to move I say they stay just like I left them and I panicked and called my mother.  When i was calm I looked at the time and it was 1:45  I was just woahed away. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
