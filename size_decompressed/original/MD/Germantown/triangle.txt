Arrowhead shaped formation of red lights moving with no sound from east to west over Germantown, MD.;2000-06-09 22:35:00;<1 minute;Arrowhead shaped formation of red lights moving with no sound from east to west over Germantown, MD. I was out on my deck and was looking up.  I saw something moving  in the corner of my eye.  I focused on it and saw a formation of 4 or 5 red lights in the shape of an arrowhead.  The lights were quite dim and difficult to see without focusing on them.  They moved extremely fast with absolutely no sound.  It passed the roof of my house about a second after I sighted it.  I proceded to my front door, but by the time I got there it was gone.  It seemed to be flying very low, since it moved so quickly.;39.146164516129;-77.272935483871
Black hovering triangle in Germantown, MD;2016-07-31 15:30:00;5-7 minutes;Black hovering triangle in Germantown, MD My friend and I were at a community pool, laying out tanning.  I was looking up at the clouds and saw a small black triangle high up towards the clouds.  It hovered for a few minutes far above us.   I told my friend, who looked and saw it as well.  It stayed in the same place for about 2-3 minutes, and then slowly flew off to the right, taking a good 4-5 minutes to finally go out of our view.   It was definitely not a bird because we saw 2 birds while we were watching it and they glided faster than this object was flying.  It was black, triangle, almost boomerang shaped, with either a reflective surface or lights that flashed.;39.146164516129;-77.272935483871

I was testing my new iPhone 11 camera and took a picture into the night sky, into complete darkness, above my home and much to my surprise I noticed two triangular shaped objects in the sky from the picture I took.  Please see attached picture.  They seemed to be far enough away that I couldnâ€™t have heard any sound or have any idea how large they are.;39.146164516129;-77.272935483871
