I thought it was odd because it wasn't moving and the skies were clear. At first I thought maybe it was light reflecting off a plane, I've seen that before.  This was different.  Even though it was extremely bright it was more than just a light.  It had shape, I could see that it was spherical. Just as I thought, Oh my God, that's a UFO not a plane  The light got brighter quickly then slowly faded out.  It disappeared.   I pulled over and stared at the spot for a minutes waiting for it to reappear.;39.146164516129;-77.272935483871
