White Round Objects viewed from Germantown;2007-07-21 18:30:00;10 Minutes;White Round Objects viewed from Germantown Saturday July 21st 2007 about 6:30PM  I was outside looking in a Southwesterly direction, looking at air traffic when I noticed a plane below and ahead of it in front there was a white round like object flying about the same speed as the plane. The skies where partly cloudy, I ran inside the house to get my camera, but when I came out the object had flown under the clouds and it blended right in. about 5 minutes when by when I then spotted the object again when it broke the cloud on the other side. I follow it until I could not see it any longer.  Saturday July 21st 2007 about 7:30PM  Around an hour later a friend came outside and sat next to me and I started telling him what I had seen, as I was showing him pointing at another airplane heading about the same direction, he said to me look there it is, and at a much higher altitude there was an object much smaller round like same white color appearance traveling in a northerly direction, we followed it for about five minutes but it was a bit stressing on the eyes to keep tracking it.;39.146164516129;-77.272935483871

Multiple UFO sighting flying slowly.;2017-04-07 22:32:00;20 minutes;Multiple UFO sighting flying slowly. I was coming home from the hospital from visiting a friend at 10:30pm in Germantown, MD. I looked up and saw multiple silver circle shaped objects close together.  They were couple thousand feet in the air, so I knew it wasn't drones flying.  I knew it was airplanes because they were so many of them and they were close together.  I counted 12 of them they were flying very slow and no noise at all.  I tried filming this but my iPhone had poor quality.  This lasted about 20 minutes, until they disappeared by clouds.   This was my very first UFO sighting!;39.146164516129;-77.272935483871
Approx 05:45 on April 28 2017 I witnessed a single, bright, star like object in the southern sky of Germantown, MD.;2017-04-28 05:45:00;20 minutes;Aprox 05:45 on April 28 2017 I witnessed a single, bright, star like object in the southern sky of Germantown, MD. At approximately 05:45 on April 28, 2017, I witnessed a single bright star like object in the southern sky of Germantown, MD.  The Sky was dark and had absolutely no stars or planets visible.  Just this single stationary bright round object.  It never once moved on any plane.  It was too high to be a helicopter and displayed no aircraft characteristics.   I picked up a passenger and 5 minutes into their trip (I am UBER driver) we both required the object.  Being I was driving I could not keep an eye on it.   After dropping passenger off, I could not re-aquire the object.  I am wondering if it was Space Station?  Only object I can think of.  I am surprised no other reports seemed to have surfaced.;39.146164516129;-77.272935483871
