3 Lights In Triangle Shape...Glen Burnie, MD / Pasadena, MD;1999-03-10 20:00:00;30 Minutes;3 Lights In Triangle Shape...Glen Burnie, MD / Pasadena, MD UFO Spotted in Glen Burnie, MD on 3/10/1999 at approx. 8:00PM...  All I could see was 3 very bright white lights in a triangle shape.  It must have been far up in the sky and made no noise at all.  It stayed for about 30 minutes and then headed in a south-east direction.  I followed it but it disappeared when I got about 1/2 mile down the road.  It didn't move very fast, but I really couldn't tell because I don't know how far away it was.  It made no noise and did not move for approx. 30 minutes.  I was going to get my videocamera and videotape it but I didn't want to leave it because I thought it might land and I wanted to follow it.  However, other people in Glen Burnie and Pasadena, MD saw it, and they videotaped it and took a picture of it.  This occured 10 miles away from BWI Airport.  UFO watchers in this area contacted the airport about this UFO and many others spotted in the area but they claim they didn't see it on radar.  UFO watchers group also contacted military and government about this and many other UFO's and keep getting the same answer: They have no knowledge of any of this.;39.1667412280702;-76.6244377192983
Returning from work my husband and I spotted a huge glowing, intense lights that resembled a fire, along the woods on 8th avenue, Glen;2006-11-06 02:00:00;10-15 minutes;Returning from work my husband and I spotted a huge glowing, intense lights that resembled a fire, along the woods on 8th avenue, Glen Burnie.We pulled over, and we were going to report a fire except there was no smoke and the lights seemed to shift around from white, red and orange and shine above the tree line. We sat trying to figure out what it could be for a matter of moments.We proceeded on Crain Hwy, the lights were visible behind the industrial buildings so it was a pretty large area.While stopping at the gas station on the corner we noticed a few people gassing up their cars were pretty perplexed by the lights as well.After we returned from a near by 24 hour diner the lights were gone, and there was no sign anything had happend.

Strange, illuminated cloud in an exceptionally cloudless sky..;2014-08-28 05:00:00;1 minute;Strange, illuminated cloud in an exceptionally cloudless sky.. Approx. 5 am, I am leaving for work.  Exceptionally clear sky and brilliant stars all week.  Amazed to see a small single round cloud less than 1000' above my house, except it wasn't really a cloud, just cloud-like.   I quickly scanned the entire visible sky and confirmed not another cloud marked the sky from horizon to horizon.   As I stared at this cloud, it dissipated before my eyes in about 5 seconds.  I turned to retrieve something from my car and then returned my attention to the previous spot I'd been watching and was amazed to see another cloud in EXACTLY the same place except this time it was glowing orange.  The glowing was coming from INSIDE the cloud!   I live near BWI airport, directly in an approach route and have seen all types of aircraft come and go, jets and props, and have also seen the occasional spot lights scan the sky on cloudy or foggy nights.  This was an anomaly and was not lighted from the ground nor was it any aircraft.  Beyond that, I have absolutely no idea what I was looking at.  Just to repeat, THERE WAS NOT ANOTHER SINGLE CLOUD in the sky, and it was, again, exceptionally clear.   I then ran back inside my house, woke my girlfriend, and we both were back outside within 60 seconds but there was no sign, nor clouds, anywhere to be seen.;39.1667412280702;-76.6244377192983
