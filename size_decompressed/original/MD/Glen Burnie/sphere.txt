white/silver orb  seen in Glen Burnie Md. following 2 high altitude jets leaving contrails.;2004-11-08 08:00:00;3-4 minutes;white/silver orb  seen in Glen Burnie Md. following 2 high altitude jets leaving con trails. At approximately 8:00 am Monday morning I noticed two high flying jets traveling south to north, leaving a contrail. Behind the two jets a ways back I saw a white/silver orb following behind the jets. It was about the size of a dime at arms length. It followed along behind the jets for about 3-4 minutes, long enough for my school friends to see it too. Shortly after the sphere was lost to view a green helicopter, the same shape as the Maryland Police helicopter but NOT a police helicopter, followed along the same path but much lower and much slower. It may have been a coincidence.    This was reported to me by my 12 year old son. I have transcribed it as told.;39.1667412280702;-76.6244377192983
The White Orb aircraft pulled off Star Wars like maneuvers with warp speed seeming to teleport from the Ursa Major constellation.;2015-10-24 23:15:00;3 minutes;The White Orb aircraft pulled off Star Wars like maneuvers with warp speed seeming to teleport from the Ursa Major constellation. At approximately 23:15, I was outside smoking a cigarette and looking up at the night sky, like I usually do.  I noticed a white orb shoot from a star which was on the handle of the Big Dipper.  The object was doing zig zag maneuvers, too fast for any known aircraft we the public have knowledge about.  This white orb continually did the same maneuvers in the same area for approximately 3 minutes.   A passenger airline was flying by when all of a sudden, the Orb seemed to warp towards the plane and disappeared.  I've never witnessed any known craft to do such maneuvers.   This is not the only UFO I've seen, but sure is one of the creepiest.;39.1667412280702;-76.6244377192983
