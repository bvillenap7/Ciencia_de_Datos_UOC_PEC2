As I followed it for a few minutes I looked away few 1 second max. .And when I looked back where the object was it was no longer visible. At first I thought I lost it behind a tree that was obstructing my view. But Iwaited and the object never came back into view even when I moved to different viewpoints . It was very clear that night and I looked all around and there wasnt a    plane in sight. The object had dissappeared without a trace. I went outside to walk my dog when I spotted the light. It was about the size of half a penny held at arms length. It was yellowish-orangish in color. It made no sound or smell. It was moving at about the same speed a commercial airplane does. I spotted it in the southeastern sky and it was moving in a southwesternly direction. It was visible for about 2-5 minutes before it vanished. It was a very clear sky that night about as clear as it gets around here. I think its altitude was about 100ft to 200ft. It was oval or almond shaped. I thought it was a airplane until it dissappeared. This is my third sighting all in Southgate comunity in Glen Burnie MD.. My mother witnessed the second sighting (two craft). This sighting was only seen by myself.;39.1667412280702;-76.6244377192983
Odd Noiseless object in the sky with red lights and No Sound heared.;2013-05-09 00:00:00;20;Odd Noiseless object in the sky with red lights and No Sound heared. It was Almost Midnight when i arrived back to the apartment complex were I live. My wife and myself observed this Light that was strobing red.  It was at first over the area of the willows apartment complex and then it went very slowly towards Bwi Airport only to come back slow to were we saw the object At First. It made no sound Like a Helicopter should have made.   I wish i would have had my camara with me. I went in my apartment and it was still there i could see it thru my window. It was at a time almost stopped above the willows Apartment complex. We live just across the street at Woodforest Apartments. Very Odd I thought about one of those rf toys that Fly but it was too high for that and made no noise and just stalled in the air with only red Lights strobing.;39.1667412280702;-76.6244377192983
