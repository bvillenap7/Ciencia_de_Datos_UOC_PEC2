Glowing V moves across sky;2007-11-29 20:45:00;15 seconds;Glowing V moves across sky I walked outside to get something from my car and looked up.  The night was clear and I started to admire the stars when I saw right in the middle of my field of vision a v shaped object moving steadily across the sky.  I thought to video it with my cell phone, but the glow was so dim I knew it wouldn't come through so I just stared at it as it moved out of my field of vision.  There were lights from the city (I'm close to Baltimore) so as it got close to the horizon the lights overpowered the dim glow.;39.1667412280702;-76.6244377192983
