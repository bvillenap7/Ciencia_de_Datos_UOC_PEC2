BRILLIANT ROUND LIGHT 200 FEET AWAY SHONE INTO MY BEDROOM HYPNOTICALLY;1990-07-15 02:00:00;15 MINUTES;BRILLIANT ROUND LIGHT 200 FEET AWAY SHONE INTO MY BEDROOM HYPNOTICALLY I AM NOW A RETIRED CLINICAL SOCIAL WORKER/PSYCHOLOGIST WITH MORE THAN 35 YEARS OF PRACTICE.  I WAS LIVING ALONE BACK ON JULY 15, 1990 IN A NEW TOWNHOUSE IN GLEN BURNIE, MARYLAND.  I HAD BEEN LIVING THERE FOR TWO WEEKS WHEN THE EVENT HAPPENED.  I WAS AWAKE LYING IN MY SECOND FLOOR BEDROOM WHEN AT APPROXIMATELY 2:00 AM I WAS AWAKENED BY AN ALMOST BLINDING BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT THAT SHONE DIRECTLY INTO MY EYES THROUGH AN OPEN WINDOW WITH THE SHADE TOTALLY RAISED.  THE LIGHT WAS ROUND AND AS LARGE AS ABOUT 5-6 FULL MOONS.  IT SHONE DOWN TOWARD MY EYES AT APPROXIMATELY A 45 DEGREE ANGLE FROM THE SKY. THE LIGHT SOURCE WAS ABOUT 200 TO 300 FEET AWAY FROM MY HOUSE. IT SHONE VERY MUCH LIKE A SEARCHLIGHT FROM A POLICE HELICOPTER ONLY 4 OR 5 TIMES BRIGHTER.  I KNEW IT WAS NOT A HELICOPTED BECAUSE THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO SOUND AND THE LIGHT DID NOT MOVE OR FLUTTER BUT WAS PERFECTLY STATIONERY.  I WAS COMPLETELY MESMERIZED BY THE LIGHT AND COULD NOT MOVE AS IF I WERE PARALYZED.  IT SHONE FOR WHAT I FELT TO BE ABOUT 15 MINUTED.  I DESPERATELY WANTED THE LIGHT TO STOP SHINING.  I FELT AN UNSEEN ALIEN PRESENCE CONTROLLING ME ATTENTION SO THAT I COULD NOT LOOK AWAY OR JUMP OUT OF BED.  THERE ARE NO SPECIFIC CONCEPTS OF WHAT KIND OF THOUGHTS OR TRANSMISSIONS MIGHT HAVE OCCURRED DURING THESE 15 MINUTES.  I FOCUSED WHATEVER VOLITIONAL THINKING I COULD  MUSTER ON ASKING WHOEVER OR WHATWVER WAS FLYING THIS CRAFT AND SHINING THIS LIGHT INTO MY EYES.   FINALLY I WAS RELEASEED FROM THIS CAPTIVE HYPNOTIC STATE AND WAS ABLE TO BLINK. WHEN I REOPENED MY EYES THE CRAFT AND LIGHT WERE GONE AND I FELT AN EERIES CHILL UP AND DOWN MY SPINE.   I HAVE TOLD MY TWO ADULT CHILDREN AND TWO CLOSE FRIENDS ABOUT THIS INCIDENT BUT NE ER REPORTED IT TO THE POLICE FOR FEAR OF BEING LABELED AS NUTS.  I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT I AM VERY STABLE MENTALLY AND AM NOT PRONE TO HALLUCINATIONS OR DELUSIONS,  I COULD SUPPLY YOU WITH MANY MANY SOUND MINDED UPSTANDING CITIZENS WHO COULD ATTEST TO MY CREDIDBILITY.   OCCASSIONALLY I HAVE BAD DREAMS ABOUT THIS EXPERIENCE.;39.1667412280702;-76.6244377192983
