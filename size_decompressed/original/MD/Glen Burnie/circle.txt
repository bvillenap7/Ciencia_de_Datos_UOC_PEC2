It had a lot of red flashing lights on it.  It was white in color with red lights.  It appeared to have a criss-crossing of lines on it, almost looking like a snowflake.  It would sit motionless for a while, then move jerkingly through the sky.  Finally it went too far for me to be able to keep watching it.;39.1667412280702;-76.6244377192983

If i had to guess I'd say it was a hot air balloon?  But its close proximity to BWI air traffic should rule that out?  What looked like fire would glow bright dime and then vanish as the object just hovered in the night sky.  Did any others see this?;39.1667412280702;-76.6244377192983
