Cylinder gets skinnier and then disapears like when turning off a TV. 2 people saw the craft near BWI airport... living near the Airport we are use to seeing aircraft... this craft had birght lights and there wasnt a glare from the lights like normal lights... that is why it cought our eyes... after about 10 second of stairing at it... the cylinder craft disapeared completely... I myself have 20/10 vison and could no make out where the craft was... there were no clouds where the craft had been and it was still mostly light out... it disapeared much like how a TV would Turn off... it got skinnier and disapeared without a single trace. I would have passed it off as myself going crazy if the person i was with didnt ask if i saw it also.;39.1667412280702;-76.6244377192983
Silver cigar shaped object spotted in Maryland;2015-01-05 15:43:00;45 seconds;Silver cigar shaped object spotted in Maryland At 3:43pm on 1/5/2015 in Glen Burnie, Maryland, United States, I saw a long silver object.  I was looking out my open window towards the east.  It appeared to be very very high in the sky it was long and silver bright and moved at a steady rate toward what looked to be SE.   It was very very clear sky's and not a cloud in site with very bright blue sky's.  It appeared as if the sun from the west was shining very bright on the object.  This is a pretty windy day so it could just be a silver balloon.  The object did not turn or shift it just seemed to dissolve.   I live with in about a few miles of a airport and have planes and other aircraft fly directly over my house, so close I can read and see which airline the plane is from.  I have lived here my entire life, im 26 years old so I know aircraft very well and their paths of flight. This object made no noise at all.  Whenever I see a very high up plane that flies by and the sound does not hit my ears till later due to ai! rcraft speed and hight the object I saw had no sound ever.  I hope this report helps someone confirm their sighting if they saw the same object.   Thanks for letting me share my sighting.  If the owners of this site need more info just let me know.   Thanks.
