We were on my patio sitting around after the kids lit off July 4th fireworks. It had been a stormy day, but the thunderstorms had moved out about an hour earlier. Sky was mostly clear.  A recently-retired Lockheed-Martin aerospace engineer brought his kids (who go to school with my kids) over for a barbecue. His wife and my wife are on a couple of PTA committees. We were all sitting around talking and he and his family were getting ready to leave when a big triangular craft about 150 feet on each side with whitish lights at the vertices flew over at about 200 feet and 200 mph. No sound whatsoever.  My wife said: What was THAT? The aerospace engineer said: It's just an old Boeing stealth recon aircraft. You should see the new stuff they fly. He then said he and his family had to get home and they left a few minutes later.;39.2756;-77.2115
