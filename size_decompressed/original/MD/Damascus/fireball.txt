Saw many red fireball spheres moving sequentially across the sky along a path through the property over Damascus, Maryland on December 31, 2020 just before midnight on New Years Eve.  These same orbs look like the ones seen in Kiawah Island just off the South Carolina coast, about 25 miles south of Charleston on Christmas Eve 2018.  They were identical with a multidimensional glow.  I would say they looked more like living organic cells that transformed from an internal yellow to a central darker nucleus or went through some nuclear transformation or altering gene state when it passed over head and got closer to me video taping.  Between scene shot 1.58 to 1.59 you see this cell cycle transition in the sky.;39.2756;-77.2115
