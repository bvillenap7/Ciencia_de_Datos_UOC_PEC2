It was very definate in shape.  We could see the shadow the saucer in the sky.  It just flew straight by overhead.  Their were 3 red lights that would blink one after the other and everyonce in a while a 4th one would blink.  It siting seemed to last an hour as my friend and I sat there in disbelief wondering if we both saw it or if we were dreaming.  But it was very clear that there was definately something there that wasn't a normal aircraft. I just feel frightened  and obligated to let someone know of this incident.;39.2756;-77.2115
