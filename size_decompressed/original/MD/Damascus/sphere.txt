Bright orange ball seen rising over Damascus tree-line morning after storm.;2014-07-14 05:10:00;5 minutes;Bright orange ball seen rising over Damascus tree-line morning after storm. Saw a bright orange ball several miles out (about the size of a star), just over the tree line.  I wouldn't have given it much thought it except that it was unusually bright -- a very warm orange.  Then I noticed it was rising.   After a minute of rising it started to drift to my left what might've been several hundred feet (about an inch from my perspective on the ground).  I was hoping it would dart around but its movement was slow, almost lethargic, albeit not like any aircraft I've seen.   After what looked like some more swaying about it started to drift up again (about an inch every 5 seconds) before fading out behind a storm cloud. I've never seen a UFO before.  I was on my front steps having an early morning cigarette.  The sky was a bleak grey patched with left over storm clouds. I did a few minutes of reading online about Chinese lanterns immediately after seeing the orb and almost didn't write this report.   Then I realized that we just had a decent storm last night, with very strong lightning that lasted until midnight.  Any Chinese lanterns anyone might've lit for the 4th of July had to have been very durable, or very lucky to survive last night's storm.;39.2756;-77.2115
