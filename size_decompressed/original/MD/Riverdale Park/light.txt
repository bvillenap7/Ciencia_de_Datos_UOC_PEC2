It mas moving slowly moving from NE to N direction.  A moment later of watching, three other similarly oriented objects appeared to be rising in a vertical line and moving from NE to N. I then urgently called my husband from inside the house to look.   There was no sound, they glowed for possibly a few minutes and then faded out completely. I took pictures of them.  While sky lanterns are illegal in Maryland.  While the neighbor, husband and I were both shocked at the observation, the neighbor does not believe they were UFOs, suspected that they were sky lanterns.;38.957;-76.9144
