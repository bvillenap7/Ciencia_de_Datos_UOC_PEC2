Round large orange and black shaped ball that was in the same spot for two to three minutes.  Ran inside and got my camera and took a picture from the deck.  Went to the ground to take a second picture and it disappeared into thin air.  It was almost see through but bright and vibrant with a black haze covering it.  Too big to be a blood moon or planet.
