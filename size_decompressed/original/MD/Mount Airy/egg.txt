Strange lights in egg-shaped formation over Mt. Airy, Maryland.;2016-10-09 00:00:00;40 minutes;Strange lights in egg-shaped formation over Mt. Airy, Maryland. Between 11:45pm and 12:10am, I saw outside my window a strange formation of lights, appeared to be in an egg shape, very, very bright white lights, seemed to be moving together in some king of formation, although, the lights seemed to separate and rejoin periodically.  The lights were behind some very think trees in my yard, and at one point, about 5 of 12 midnight started to move towards my house, and light got brighter.   I became frightened, and tried to call my daughter, but she didn't answer the phone.  Then the lights backed away from my house a little bit.  At that point I videotape the craft which seemed to be moving erratically, and then shot straight up and disappeared into the dark sky.;39.3886;-77.1683
