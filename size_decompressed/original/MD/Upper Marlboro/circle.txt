It was moving extremely fast and there was no noise whatsoever.  The object looked like it was at low altitude and as soon as I looked at it it diss appeared.  I only saw it for about 3 seconds and it was gone.  I've never seen anything move so fast. A bout 10 minutes later there were helicopters in the area.  I live very close to Andrews AFB and planes and helicopters every day but this was unusual.  Again I only saw this thing for a split second but that was the fastest thing I've ever seen and it just disappeared (no clouds).;38.850331627907;-76.8050274418605
