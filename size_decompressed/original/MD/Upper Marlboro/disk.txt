I have interviewed them numerous times and just last night I questioned them again and this time I wrote it down so I wouldnt forget. They were traveling by car at night down route 301 in Maryland. They saw 6 disk shaped crafts hovering above the power lines about 50 to 100 feet. They ships were very close together and did not move. They pulled over on the side of the road, got out and looked up to stare at them. The ships had white/yellowish lights  on them that went around. They got back in the car after 5 minutes until they were out of site of the ships. The ships remained until they could no longer see them.;38.850331627907;-76.8050274418605
