Rocket like object Flys over us with high speed;2017-12-14 23:08:00;15 seconds;Rocket like object Flys over us with high speed My girlfriend and I were sitting in my car, when she pointed out what looked to be a shooting star.  A cigar shaped object.  When she pointed this out I noticed it in the sky also. A couple seconds go by and we realize that this object is actually going upward towards the sky and then a bright light like flames started to appear under the object as if it were a Rocket or missle. After about 5 seconds, the flames/bright - light stops but this object is continuing to go up.  Finally it then  elevated  horizontally and zooms off in the sky like coming in the direction we are, but above and high above us.  As i noticed it was going to fly over us I get out the car and it’s partly cloudy out, but i was able to see this object fly over us and then disappear into the clouds.  This object sounded like an air plane  and had a green light on it flashing. We both are still mighty confused on what we saw tonight.  Couldn’t think of anything else it could be.  All of this happened in 20-25 seconds;38.850331627907;-76.8050274418605
