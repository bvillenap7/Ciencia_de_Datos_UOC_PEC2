Orange sets of lights seen over Maryland;2013-11-17 18:00:00;<5 minutes;Orange sets of lights seen over Maryland While driving north on route 4, just north of upper marlboro, md I noticed two light orange lights (which resembled small fireballs) in the sky moving from west to east.  The lights traveled over route 4 staying the same distance from each other.  Less than a minute later another pair of lights traveled the same path staying similar distance from each other.    Following the two sets of lights were 3 or 4 single orbs of light.   No sound could be heard above regular traffic noise.;38.850331627907;-76.8050274418605
