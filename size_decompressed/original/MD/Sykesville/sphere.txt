Reddish-Orange orbs sighted in Sykesville, MD.;2014-08-29 23:20:00;5 minutes;Reddish-Orange orbs sighted in Sykesville, MD Around 11:20pm this evening I was driving south on Route 32 in Sykesville, MD, when I noticed strange lights in the sky.  It appeared to me as if they had just crossed over 32 and were heading west.  I quickly realized I was witnessing UFOs.   I turned onto Johnsville Road and got out of the car to observe.  It was eerily quiet.  There were maybe a dozen of them.  They were reddish-orange orbs that appeared to be just sitting in the sky, and then I saw them all move together, but very, very slowly.  They all proceeded together in the same direction up Johnsville Road, completely silent, and suddenly all of them disappeared at about the same time. I am not certain about this part, but I thought that the lights turned white just prior to disappearing.  I did try to get photos on my iphone.  All I have are a few shots of black sky.  In one photo there is a bright light in the bottom left corner of the photo, but I am thinking I may have picked up a street light.  I cannot be sure, it is quite blurry. Side Note:  I noticed my car lights were out when I turned around.  I had left them on.  Upon starting the vehicle, the lights immediately came on.  My lights always stay on a few minutes after the car is turned off and then they automatically shut off.  However, when I got home I left my lights on and when I opened my car door all lights shut off.  I have to assume something has gone bad in my car and the UFOs had nothing to do with my lights.  I am going to see if I can figure out why suddenly all the lights go off when I open the car door.  This has never occurred before.;39.4567;-76.9696000000001
