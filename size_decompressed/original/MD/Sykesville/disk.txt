On April 27, 2017, at 21:55 time, I heard a loud noise, so I looked and suddenly a disk/saucer started to fly over my house from right to left and continued past the house over the trees and my neighborâ€™s house and continue further.  It was several feet above the house.   The disk was very large and round in shape.  It was gray and had red running lights on both sides only in the middle of both sides.  The lights were red.   Under the saucer directly in the middle was hanging a square black box with a rectangle box attached to half of the square box.;39.4567;-76.9696000000001
