white light in sky that showed some red color changes intermittently;2008-08-10 00:15:00;1Hr 15Min (still there);white light in sky that showed some red color changes intermittently I saw a light in the North-north-east direction that was about 10 to 20 thousand feet up.  Initially I thought it could be a helicopter as it appeared to intermittently have a red flash.  However, it didn't change position significantly for over an hour.  It would at times seem to vary in position (minimally) up and down and from side to side. I looked at it through binoculars and when I focused in it appeared to be bright white light and have occasional red and green colors.  When I focused out it took on different shapes and showed the appearance of multiple lights that changed color. At 1:40 it appears to have increased in altitude.;39.4567;-76.9696000000001
Several bright lights clustered and seemed stationary except one of them moved fast to join the group.;2014-08-16 23:00:00;unknown;Several bright lights clustered and seemed stationary except one of them moved fast to join the group While driving at approximately 11:15 PM,saw a strange pattern of very bright lights in sky that seemed stationary. Drove to get a clearer view of them and then one of the lights came fast from the right of the others and became part of the group. They were not in a straight line but were clustered together.;39.4567;-76.9696000000001
Two white lights observed from private airplane prior to dawn near Frederick MD;2017-09-27 06:50:00;5 minutes;Two white lights observed from private airplane prior to dawn near Frederick MD I am a pilot and aircraft owner.  I had to go to Tennessee on Wednesday for a service call for work.  I departed from my home airport at Essex, Maryland, at 6:30am, just prior to dawn in a clear, still morning.  About 20 minutes into the flight, I was over Liberty Reservoir, headed toward Frederick, a couple of minutes before sunrise, and I saw two white lights hanging in the sky in the distance directly in front of me.  Not unusual to see inbound or outbound air traffic for BWI or Dulles, I didn't think much of it. I am aware the eye sometimes plays tricks on us, when it comes to airliners sometimes they seem to be just floating in the air, while they're actually flying typically between 180 knots and 240 knots inbound or outbound.  That's what these were doing, seemingly hanging still in the sky. Plain white lights.  If I had to guess an altitude and distance, I would say 10-15 miles away at about 6,000 to 10,000 feet. Then one of them started to move.  Up and away toward the northwest very quickly, growing progressively fainter and fainter for about 15 seconds, before moving completely out of sight.  About a minute later, the second one did exactly the same thing.;39.4567;-76.9696000000001
