Triangular shaped object with bright lights, dropping orbs, being seen over Sykesville, MD;2012-03-13 20:20:00;2 hours;Triangular shaped object with bright lights, dropping orbs, being seen over Sykesville, MD   Several people have been seeing two bright lights floating in the night sky fading from bright blue to white.  To the passing eye, they appear to be REALLY bright stars, but upon closer inspection, you realize the lights are too close to be a star and the light is not star-like.  Every once in a while a bright bluish orb will drop from it, almost looking like a shooting star, but slower.  I watched this from my bedroom window, using a nearby tree as a reference point, and it rotated and moved before my eyes, then after several hours disappears.  We have seen this phenomenon every night for the past two weeks.  One neighbor got this on his iphone and said between 5 and 6am it was closer to the ground for him to see the distinct outline of the triangle shape and it made no noise, only a beam was lightly shining on the ground, like a helicopter spotlight, only it made no noise and was massive in size.;39.4567;-76.9696000000001
Green, red, yellow triangle object near Liberty Dam.;2014-03-26 03:00:00;1 minute;Green, red, yellow triangle object near Liberty Dam I was driving home from work 3am on 3/26/14 driving up Marriottsville Road going toward Sykesville when a low lying triangle shaped object appeared in front of me just above the trees.  It appeared to have multiple green ligts, 2 red blinking lights and 1 yellow light in the back.  I pulled  my car off to side of the road and rolled down my windows to try and listen, it was slient with no down wind.  At first I thought it was a helicopter but there was no noise. It stayed in one position then slowly just went off to right in direction of reservoir I lost track of it through the trees. There were no cars on the road and there are no houses on that particular part of Marriottsville.  It lasted about a minute just wondering if anyone else in area saw anything?
