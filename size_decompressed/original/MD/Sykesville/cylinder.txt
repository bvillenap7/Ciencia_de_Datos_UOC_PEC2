Upon further observance, I realized it was a flying craft of some sort.  I observed for a moment or two and then noticed a second one behind it.  I continued to my car and put down my things and dug out my cell phone. The cylindrical craft were pretty far off and hard to see through the cell phone camera.  I could see with the naked eye that there was what appeared to be a separation or indentation in the center of the craft.  I am not sure I’m seeing its side or underneath, but I think I was seeing the side of the craft.  I can see there are no wings or propellers.  They are just bright moving cylinders. They were moving westward.  I was unable to determine if there was any sound associated with the craft as there was a chainsaw noise a few doors down.   Not long after I lost sight of the UFOs a jetliner passed over and it was obvious it was a jetliner.  I could see the wings, the side and underside as well.  The 2 craft I had been observing were not airplanes. I suspect some sort of government operation, but I cannot be certain.  I have never seen craft such as these before.  I did a youtube search and found someone in Ireland who saw the identical scene.  They also saw 2 bright daytime craft very much like what I observed.  Also, there were a lot of large black birds flying at the same time I was videoing the craft.;39.4567;-76.9696000000001
large bodied very bright silver craft with no wings, shaped like a pill and no exhaust trailings. ((anonymous report));2017-10-17 09:00:00;7 minutes;I was at the lumber yard and 3 of us saw a large bodied very bright silver craft with no wings, shaped like a pill and no exhaust trailings. For the size/diameter of the body it was moving a lot slower than a jet... it wasn’t a large ballon or a Goodyear blimp, pretty big in diameter and moving slower than a chair and it didn’t have wings or exhaust coming out the back, slower than a jet.
