3 Orange colored objects in formation over Sykesville, Maryland New Year's Eve 2012;2013-01-01 00:05:00;15 minutes;3 Orange colored objects in formation over Sykesville, Maryland New Year's Eve 2012 My husband, myself and our son were outside last night shooting off some fireworks for New Year's Eve when we witnessed 3 orange glowing objects flying in a triangular formation moving in moderate speed from west to east and with no sound coming from them.   They disappeared rather slowly and gradually from sight and then a few minutes later two of the orange lights appeared again moving in the same direction and speed as the first three objects.   We know they were not passenger aircraft or helicopters.;39.4567;-76.9696000000001
