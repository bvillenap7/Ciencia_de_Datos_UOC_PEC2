White Orb Sighting at 7pm in Harford, MD;2018-09-18 19:12:00;5 minutes;White Orb Sighting at 7pm in Harford, MD Was at daughters Soccer practice in Fallston, MD, and noticed a bright looking object in the sky just after 7pm.  Initially thinking it was a star, I thought it was unusually bright and then noticed it appeared to be moving.  I pulled out my phone and started recording, and after zooming in, the object appeared as a white sphere on video that almost pulsated appeared to grow in size and shrink back down over seconds.  This all appeared to be at a far distance.  It moved gently to bouncing in no consistent pattern around the sky in a small vicinity.  The Sphere then became hard to track and seemingly vanished and then a smaller black object appeared very close in the sky.  It was either the same object or a second different object.  Over the next few minutes the bright lighted object appeared and disappeared.  Because of the distance they were easy to loose focus of, but then bright lighted UFO would prominently appear again.  My second video featuring the Bright lighted UFO is ended after the object seemingly vanishes into a specific direction.  There is a small local nearby airport geared for recreational flying, along with drones being used around the area.  The movement and coloration allowed me to ration past these explanations for the object.  I filmed 2 planes flying by very close to where I recorded the object as a reference.  (At first, thinking the planes may be investigating, however not moving fast as a jet, making them seem recreational.);39.5303;-76.4356
