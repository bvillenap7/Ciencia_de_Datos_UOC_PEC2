It's standing perfectly still in the southwest sky.  We've been watching it for the last 45 minutes.  Sometimes it will move slightly right of left, but has not moved from the original spot we saw it in.  It is a very clear night out, so there are a lot of stars in the sky, but this is entirely different - much larger and brighter. ((NUFORC Note:  We observe that the sighting is not inconsistent with that of a planet.  PD));39.5303;-76.4356
