Had just laid down on the porch to sunbathe, when I looked up a saw a massive white cylinder that moved around the sky, like an etch a sketch.  At times it would tip from side to side and then became a saucer.   I watched it for 3 minutes til it shot off like a rocket toward Baltimore.  30 seconds later all the power went off in the home although there were no storms in the area.  Outage lasted a few seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));39.5303;-76.4356
