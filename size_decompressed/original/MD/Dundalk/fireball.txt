Myself and my 3 children were driving on peninsula highway in Dundalk, Maryland, 21222, when we saw 3 circular glowin white objects that had glowing tales behind them. Initially I thought they were meteors.  But, they appeared to be under intelligent control.  The trajectory of the objects were flying at a very low degree,  I think about 10 degrees.  I kept an eye on these objects for about 20 minutes until I could no longer see them due to building structures.   This was the first time I've seen what I think we're ufos.;39.2619;-76.4992000000001
