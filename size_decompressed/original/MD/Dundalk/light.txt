I didnâ€™t know what it was so I took at my phone to take a picture the object came down and the stopped and then just sat there and when I got my camera on my phone working it started to go away I got a picture but I got it when it was going back in the sky when u zoom in you can see it is a blue light and like dots of light below it. It really was weird, I never believed in this kind of stuff until I seen that! ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));39.2619;-76.4992000000001

White fast strobe and green solid squares in Baltimore, MD.;2015-11-23 20:00:00;5 minutes;white fast strobe and green solid squares in Baltimore MD We were outside looking at the moon with our telescope.  After that, I noticed A green light.  I thought it was a plane but realized it was changing from solid green to white strobes.   After it got closer I observed a few green squares next to each other In a rectangular cluster for about 30 SEC then change to white strobes dots in same formation, the strobe speed was fast to many to count in a sec.  The lights did not look like airplane light it was very brilliant also it was moving way too fast to be aircraft that are regulareally seen here.   Once I noticed this thing was not right it was almost overhead heading south then did a 90 degree turn west.   We flipped out and could not stop watching it and yelling holy crap did you see that. We watched it for about 5 minutes, until it went out of sight.;39.2619;-76.4992000000001
