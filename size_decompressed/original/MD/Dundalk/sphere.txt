I'm not the hysterical type, but what I saw while parked on the damn Wal-Mart parking lot (of all places) gave me the creeps. I'm sitting and waiting in the car while the wife shops. I was just looking toward the front entrance of the store when a glint caught my eye. I thought I saw something bouncing around next to a passenger jet flying in low. (we're not far from BWI airport) I rubbed my eyes, because I figured I was seeing a glare or something. NOPE. Upon looking back up, there were now three shiny spheres- just circling and following the aircraft until it was almost out of sight. Then- another plane was coming in low and they were back! Unreal!! These things were NOT balloons or anything like that. I'm not a drinker or a drug user and my eyesight is 20/20. It went on so long that my wife came walking out and I had time to show her. She freaked. She won't speak of it. Before they left, I asked a woman who was loading groceries if she saw what I saw. Her reaction was to turn and say Good Lord!!. She split in a hurry. Here's something strange: We can't for the life of us nail down the date we saw them. No, we weren't abducted! It's just weird. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous.

Red lights over Dundlak;2020-10-31 20:00:00;5 minutes;Red lights over Dundlak On Halloween night at 8:00, I was standing on my balcony and witnessed 6 red lights arranged at a 45 degree angle moving slowly from East to NorthEast. After a minute or so, two other crafts fell right into place at the back of the line. As they reached a certain section of the sky, they simply faded away one by one until they were finally gone.;39.2619;-76.4992000000001
Red Lights and Spotlight;2020-10-31 20:00:00;5 minutes;Red Lights and Spotlight Observed 6 red lights in a 45 degree pattern moving from east to northeast. After a couple minutes, two other lights appeared in sync with the speed and alignment of the other aircraft. After roughly 5 minutes, the lights went out one by one after reaching the same location in the sky. Also observed a spotlight in the same direction for three days leading up to the sighting. It was definitely not being sent from the ground. It appeared as on the edge of a disc. I would see appx 180% of light, then nothing. Then the cycle would repeat. This went on for about 10 minutes each night.;39.2619;-76.4992000000001
