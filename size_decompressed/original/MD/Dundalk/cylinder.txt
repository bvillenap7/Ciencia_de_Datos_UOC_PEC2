Out of a v-shaped cloud.;2013-06-23 20:15:00;10;My cousins fianc√© and my self seen 8 white cylinder shaped somethings in the sky they were flying out of a v shaped cloud one by one about 1-2 mins apart.  They sped up and slow way down almost as if it were hovering.  Then they would disappear once the last one came out the cloud broke apart.   I have never seen anything like this. We tried to tape it and take pictures but none of them would show up everything else did but them. ((NUFORC Note:  We presume a nighttime sighting, and have amended the time above.  PD));39.2619;-76.4992000000001

I witnessed a white cylinder shaped object levitating over Logan Village shopping center in Dundalk, MD, around 5:30 pm on 07/24/2015, while waiting for the bus to go home.   I was at bus stop for about 10-15 minutes.  I noticed it just staying in the same spot up in the sky.  Clouds were moving, but the object wasn't.  I don't know what it is.;39.2619;-76.4992000000001
