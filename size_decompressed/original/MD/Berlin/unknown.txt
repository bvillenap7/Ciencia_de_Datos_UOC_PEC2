Object in the sky on Maryland's eastern shore.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of a twinkling star?  PD));2014-11-28 22:40:00;Still happening;Object in the sky on Maryland's eastern shore. We were outside sitting on the porch of my parents home.  My husband noticed a bright object in the sky.  He pointed it out and said is that a star?  I looked at it and it appeared to be changing colors.  At first glance one would assume it was a star.  We watched it for several minutes and it did not appear to be moving.  I went inside and got binoculars. When we viewed it through the binoculars it appeared to be am object that is flashing very bright colored lights that are blue, red, green, and white.  Definitely not a star or planet.  We asked my mother to look and she said she saw the same thing.  It is still there and just appears to be hovering.  Has anyone else in this area seem this?
