About 11:00 AM Eastern Time 9/19/2013 in Berlin, Maryland, I walked outside with my children (4 and 2 years old) and looked up at the sky to see if there were any Chem-trails today.  The sky was clear and blue with a few scattered white clouds.  I saw what I thought was a very large bright white star in the sky near the sun.  (About 4 times the size of a regular star, but in broad day light.  Bright white and perfectly round.) It was moving quite fast but in a stop/start sporadic path.  It would surge forward a few “inches” in my view, stop, then go again a few more “inches” in roughly a 45 degree angle.  I was not wearing sunglasses so this was not a reflection on a lens. I watched it for about 10-15 seconds until it started to enter a cloud, and was about to go out of my vision due to my house’s roof.  So I looked down for a moment and walked down my 3 steps so I wouldn’t lose it.  When I looked back up it was gone, and I stood for 5 minutes trying to find it again but could not. I am General Manager for a local business almost 30 years old.  There was a white plane high in the sky a few inches from where the light vanished in a cloud.  This white plane continued on its path and did not seem to respond to the light.;38.346;-75.1833
Orange light over the ocean seen from the coast of Maryland.;2014-10-27 19:20:00;30 seconds;Orange light over the ocean seen from the coast of Maryland. On October 27, 2014 at 7:20 PM at Assateague State Park, Berlin, Maryland, while observing the night sky I saw the international space station go by as well as satellites and a meteor.  I also noticed an orange light over the ocean that resembled the red navigation light of an aircraft.  I viewed the light with 10x50 binoculars as the orange light travel north then either turned east or climbed upward, decreased in size, flashed a few times then disappeared. I have worked night work for years on the coast of Maryland and have spent many hours watching the night sky.  But I have never seen anything like this orange light.;38.346;-75.1833

Seem to move with the rotation of the earth, but stars do not emulate such colors.  Seen it on several different occasions.....what is it?;38.346;-75.1833
The a/c was just above the tree line, going at a fast rate.  It was flashing red and white lights.  It was heading north towards Dover.;2015-07-30 03:00:00;2 minutes;The aircraft was just above the tree line, going at a fast rate.  It was flashing red and white lights.  It was heading north towards Dover, DE.   I came upon a open field and searched frantically for the lights and it was nowhere in sight.  It just disappeared.;38.346;-75.1833
