Three stationary lights in triangular pattern;2010-11-19 19:00:00;20 minutes;Three stationary lights in triangular pattern Saw three stationary lights in a triangular pattern below the moon, above the water. They stayed on for about 30 seconds, shut off for a few minutes, then came back on again.  One of the lights then made quick circulations as if the lights were going around on a larger object.   A few minutes later the three lights came back on but were in a diagonal line this time.  The lights were slightly bigger than stars and gave of a radiant white glow.  I also noticed two plumes of smoke in the sky. Just little trails of smoke. One above the lights, and one to the right of the lights.;38.346;-75.1833
