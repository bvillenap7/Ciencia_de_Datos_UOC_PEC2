Red glowing object and Triangle -north east maryland;2008-01-24 21:15:00;1 minute;Red glowing object and Triangle -north east maryland 	At approximately 21:00 I received a phone call from an associate about a first hand encounter of a craft hovering above his vehicle in Bel Air, Maryland. This was before the sighting I am reporting myself.  He described the shape to be triangular but smoothed around the edges like a guitar pick and having 5 or 6 blue lights. It made no noise at all and just hovered about his vehicle then disappeared. Around 21:15, I spotted a figure in the sky, three lights in a row, a diagonal line. The line faded in and out twice and then completely disappeared. Ten minutes later, the object came around again but this time actually had more shape to it, its aura cigar like in shape. It first appeared as a small red dot-like shape in the sky then got increasingly bigger. It glowed red and looked as if it was spinning. I could kind of make out the shape of the central point, which was like an oval ring or halo. I started freaking out and telling someone about it and as soon as I started to it kind of just faded away, shifting into the sky to the left of me. Another in the same area, its position to the south, spotted this object, which is the general direction of the town of Bel Air where my associate spotted the object directly above him. The colors described were different so I decided to count them as two different sightings.  I would rather submit little personal info as possible though I have included my email for further contact.;39.6022;-75.9529
