They remained stationary as the flashed.;2013-08-15 04:40:00;15 seconds;They remained stationary as the flashed. As I was on my back deck drinking coffee and smoking a cigarette, I looked into the night sky for a chance of seeing any left over meteors from the perisids.  I did not see any streaking across the sky.   But, suddenly, a bright stationary object appeared and flashed once then disappeared.  About 5 seconds later it reappeared and flashed again remaining in the same spot.  A split second after the second flash another, bright flash appeared to the left of the original object.  It flashed again and disappeared.   I stood watching for severl minutes and the objects did not reappear.  I also looked for any flying aircraft from strobes but none were to be seen.   The lights I saw were not aircraft strobe lights plus they remained stationary, while flashing.;39.6022;-75.9529

Went out for a cigarette and saw a portion of the sky was glowing red.  I moved so I could see the sky more clearly and noticed all bugs had stopped making sounds.   I watched the glow for several minutes and noticed it was pulsing in 1 second intervals.   I pulled my phone out and tried to record it, but the moment I hit record, the glowing just stopped, and the sky went back to normal, and the bugs resumed making noise agin.   I didn't see any ships or objects, but I simply cannot explain what I saw.;39.6022;-75.9529
