I was driving down the road when I reached a semi-clearing. I saw three orange circular lights in the sky, two flying close together and one farther ahead. They were like a long, stretched out triangle. Then the one that was farther ahead dropped lower than the other two and it became an upside-down triangle. The two lights that were close together separated, and the entire formation became more like a normal triangle. It was clear that the three lights were separate and not part of the same object. Next, one light went on farther ahead of the other two lights. The two close lights were in such a position as the bunch was almost in a line. The farthest light then slowly burnt out, then the middle one, and finally the last one. During this whole thing, the lights were too low to be a plane, but they definitely were not helicopters. They moved very slowly.  It must be noted that the sighting was in the general vicinity of an extremely large, mostly abandoned, quarry.;39.6022;-75.9529
