Large soft diamond shaped light in sky emitting a prismed light.;2018-04-10 23:00:00;10 minutes;Large soft diamond shaped light in sky emitting a prismed light. I was driving east on route 40.  Less than a mile before the Mechanics Valley Rd and Rt 40 intersection, I noticed an oddly large soft diamond shape light to the left of Rt. 40.  The light emitted from it seemed to prism, if that makes sense, and was mainly red or silver.  The size of the light as well as the shape, I know it was not a plane or a helicopter.  I had put down my window to see if I could hear anything and could not. I passed through the Mechanics Valley and Rt 40 intersection the light was still to the left of Rte. 40.  Coming to the Rte. 40 and Rte. 272 intersection, the light crossed over Rt 40 and now seemed to be going east bound along Rt 40.  However, I made a right to go north bound on Rte. 272 the light then remainded parallel to my travel path until I made a right onto Lums Rd and I could no longer find it. Honestly, it was so odd that it actually scared me.  I tried seeing if what I was seeing was a tower light being seen from an odd perspective-since I was driving, but this light was larger, was definitely moving, and was not a plane or helicopter. The oddest thing I've seen in the night sky.;39.6022;-75.9529
