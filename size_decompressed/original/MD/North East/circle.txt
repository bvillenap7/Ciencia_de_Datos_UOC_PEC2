Orange/yellow object in the sky;2013-07-03 21:30:00;20 minutes;Orange/yellow object in the sky While I was on my boat in with my husband and two friends watching fireworks we saw a steady orange/yellow lighted, circular object in the sky.  There was no sound coming from the craft.   We watched it hover in the same spot for about 20 minutes, turned to look at fireworks for about 30 seconds, then turned back to see the object and it was completely gone from the sky.   We stayed in the same spot for 40 minutes and never saw it again.;39.6022;-75.9529
