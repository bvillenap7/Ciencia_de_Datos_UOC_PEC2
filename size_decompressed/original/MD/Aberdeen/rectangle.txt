A flash of white light streaked across the sky over top the trees too small and too low to be an airplane and made no sound and moving way too fast to be a helicopter.   The Aldino Airpark is close but planes never fly to or from there that late and dark in the night. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
