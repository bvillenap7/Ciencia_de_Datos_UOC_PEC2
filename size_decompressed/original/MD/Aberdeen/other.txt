I was leaving my work after it closed with other people I work with and my friend who just got in to town to visit me.  I heard a plane and glanced up and when I did I saw a very dim object moving not too far from the plane but seemed to be lower than and behind the plane.  It was moving silently and roughly the same speed as the plane and started to veer off in a different direction from the plane and then suddenly disappeared.  It was hard to tell if the object was six or seven round objects flying in formation, or one object that had six or seven discs on it that were either very dim lights or reflective material reflecting ground light.   My friend was the only other person to see it because my co workers were busy talking to one another and by the time they looked up it was gone.;39.5125;-76.1806
Boomerang shaped object over Aberdeen, Maryland.;2014-12-13 19:30:00;15 seconds;Boomerang shaped object over Aberdeen, Maryland. My wife and I were sitting in our hot tub getting ready to watch the Geminid meteor showers. We didn't know they started after 9:30pm.  While I was scanning the night time sky I noticed an object crossing the sky.   I immediately told my wife to look at what I was looking at.  To her amazement she saw what I saw!  The object was shaped like a boomerang.  The object emitted no sound that we could hear.  The object appeared to be see through or cloaked.  It wasn't too high in the sky either.  It was moving southeast. All we can say is we saw something that we both have never seen before.;39.5125;-76.1806
