To whom it may concern:   	I would like to report a UFO sighting on Friday September 5, 2014.  The sighting occurred around 9:00 pm in the western sky above Aberdeen, Maryland.  I was looking at the big dipper group of stars, when I noticed what appeared to be a star above the first star in the handle.  I had never noticed it before, so I continued to watch it. The star began to grow larger and brighter.  I watched it become extremely brighter then anything else in the sky for a minute or so.   The light then moved very fast towards the north, omitting a bright tail of light that disappeared in less than a second.  The tail of light was perfectly straight with no curve to it, and was hundreds of times larger than the light it seemed to come out of. 	The conditions that evening were mostly clear with some light clouds scattered in the sky below the area where the sighting occurred. I was the only witness to this sighting that I am aware of.;39.5125;-76.1806
