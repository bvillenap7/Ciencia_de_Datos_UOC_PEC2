At approx. 2310hrs in the area of Carsins Run Road in Aberdeen, MD, I was outside on my porch, the weather was partly cloudy, 0% precip, and no air traffic that I could see or hear.  What I experienced was a sky based explosion sound, similar to thunder, but sharper, not distorted by the air and resonated to where I felt it through the concrete and in my chest.   After the 2 second incident, I noticed dogs barking in the distance.  I've been through enough thunderstorms living in this area to where thunder does not and has not had that reaction on the dogs in the local area.   Earlier in the evening, my wife and I also experienced another sky based boom, to which we also felt it in our chests due to the strength.   Although not a true sighting, I felt this should be reported.;39.5125;-76.1806
