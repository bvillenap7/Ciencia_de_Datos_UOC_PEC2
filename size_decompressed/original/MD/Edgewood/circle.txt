Moving dots across the sky.  ((Spacelink satellites??));2020-02-27 05:25:00;20 minutes;Moving dots across the sky This morning around 5:30 am, we were outside & watched a procession of dots/”stars” come across the sky.  There was 40-50 of them (we didn’t count, so the total number is unknown).  We stood watching them for maybe 10 minutes, I went & woke my daughter up to come outside & watch.  She was outside with us for another 10-15 minutes.  I can only liken them to satellites but closer than any I’ve seen.  They were evenly spaced out, & continuous.  There was a couple times when there seemed to be a slight delay before they started up again (maybe a couple extra seconds).  During this, there was maybe 5 or 6 that were off to the side as if “escorting” them.  ~ I really don’t know how to describe it,  I do know I've never seen anything like it.;39.4269;-76.3094
