I'm outside the front of my house in the street listening to Frank Ocean and I'm dancing by myself with my dog and I look up and my dogs looks up as well I can't move I see something in the sky and it looks like a plane but it's not moving and it has the green lights that a plane usually has and I'm staring at it and it then moves extremely fast zooming so fast that it appears to be a flash of white light and then it's gone.;39.4269;-76.3094
