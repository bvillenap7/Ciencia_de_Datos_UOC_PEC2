I thought it was an airplane however, the object remained stationary.   As I would stare at the object it it appeared to give off other colors of light, the object yet small seemed to pulsate.   I lost interest, but went out again about 20 minutes later, and the object was still in the exact same spot.  After this point about every 20 minutes or so, I would check on the object and it was still sitting there stationary.  This went on for about 90-120 minutes before I ended up going to bed. The last time I checked on the object it did however drop a little in the sky, closer toward earth where it still hovered.   Tonight, 8-4-14 I went out to check the same location, but nothing is there.  It could not have been a star because I would see that star, and also it was a little big to be a star.   Obviously it was not a plane since the object stayed stationary for so long.  Can someone else please post if you saw the same thing Sunday night.   Thank you.;39.4269;-76.3094
