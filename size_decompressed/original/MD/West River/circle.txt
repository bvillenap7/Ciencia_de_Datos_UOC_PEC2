My son was on the front porch having a ciggarett and had notice in the northwestern sky a strange white shaped ball,egg darting about through the light pink clouds. He called me to take a look and shure enough that is what I saw. The object appeared small the size of a tennis ball from our distance.It would jump from one direction to the next in and out of the clouds at a fast pace and then it just disappeared.;38.8272;-76.5435
