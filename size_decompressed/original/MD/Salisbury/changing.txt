Vacillating object seen through kitchen window;2003-12-15 18:55:00;15 minutes;Vacillating object seen through kitchen window My friend Josh had just called. I walked into the kitchen for a snack, and when I looked out the window there was this object. It was substancially far away. At first I thought it was a star or a plane because there was a plane flying close to it. I told my friend Josh about what I saw. We had both had previous UFO experiences and had done our reading on the subject. The object started out white then vacillated, blue, then red, than white again. It was spherical at first but as it moved in a small up and down motion the shape became unclear. It moved up and down, then left and right but not far enough for the manuverability of a plane. It seeme to get a bit closer. I had been talking with Josh and watching it at the same time for about five minutes before I got a strong uneasy feeling. I looked around then back at the object. After a few seconds the feeling subsided. About eight minutes later the feeling came back but stronger. It was strong enough to make me gasp out loud. I felt like it was watching me. It seemed to come a bit closer before it flickered a few times then dissapeared. The anxious feeling subsided then. The object was about the size of a pin head but got to about the size of a pea.;38.3689147058824;-75.5954852941175
Three witness observe a black and silver object appearing to change from bell shaped to round.;2014-08-03 14:00:00;15 minutes;Three witness observe a black and silver object appearing to change from bell shaped to round. On August 3, 2014, at approx. 1400 hrs. in Salisbury, MD, three witnesses observed a black object high in the sky silhouetted against white clouds.  The object appeared to change from black to silver, hovered, moved back and forth left to right and then at a steady speed climbed up until it disappeared from view. The object at times appeared to change from bell shaped to round and when it started climbing upwards appeared to be flipping like a coin tossed into the air, alternating from black to silver. The attached photographs were taken with an Android cell phone cell phone which didnâ€™t capture the sharp contrast of the object against the clouds.;38.3689147058824;-75.5954852941175
