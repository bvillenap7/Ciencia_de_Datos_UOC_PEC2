A gold ovalish shaped craft hovering just over the tree line, varrying in intensity of light, no sound.;1997-11-24 02:00:00;2 minutes;Summary : A gold ovalish shaped craft hovering just over the tree line, varrying in intensity of light, no sound. I an d the other witness observed the object just over and within above the tree line within my backyard at 0200 hours. It appeared trough the trees as the moon or another form of light. After walking around to get a better view through the trees, we could see the object wasn't moving much, but the posibility of low flying was out of the question. The object was gold in color and oval in shape. No sound was heard from the object. The light from the object gained and decreased in intensity serveral times, making it hard to see but then popping back up out of no where. Then finally disapating completely, and no trace of the object was visible. The whole sighting lasted for about 2 minutes. The other witness and I then proceeded into her car to try and see if we could see anything departing the area around my house but to no avail.;38.3689147058824;-75.5954852941175

It would get bright then dim, then bright than dissapeared in one spot.  Gone total blackness. My friend and I were just sitting in his back yard.  All of a sudden there were these bright lights coming up from behind the trees.  These lights got brighter. We got out to see what that light was.  It was oval and it was in one spot.  We keep asking ourselfs What is that?  The light got dimmer, then brighter, then dissapeared.  There was now nothing but pitch black behind these trees now.  I called the airport for aircraft in our air at that time, none. We seen it come up behind the trees, but it dissapered in one spot.  No other explanation than it was a Unidenitifed Flying Object/ ;38.3689147058824;-75.5954852941175
Five oval white and blue lights zooming (first in patterns then straight patterns)in the cloudy sky at dusk.;2005-11-15 20:30:00;10-15 Mins;Five oval white and blue lights zooming (first in patterns then straight patterns) in the cloudy sky at dusk. Observed on a fully moonlight night just after dusk.  It was very cloudy, but clouds were moving fast.  In the clouds, I observed (corner of right eye) five moving orbs of light in the cloudy part of the sky.  I was driving.  I stopped twice to figure out where they were coming from.  The patterns shifted from circluar to meet in the middle and zoom back out again.  After I got to my destination, I watched for five more minutes.  In this time, the oval lights stopped for a few seconds and started back in an odd pattern.  First they circled again, meeting in the middle and then three of the oval lights dissapeared.  One of the two left became a blue light instead of white.  They formed a chasing pattern throughout the edge of the clouds, zooming wildly back and forth but never leaving the clouds.  Eventually, they just stopped.  I watch the skies repeatedly and I know where the beacons are in my hometown.  These were no beacons, or stars, or planes.  Totally odd.;38.3689147058824;-75.5954852941175
