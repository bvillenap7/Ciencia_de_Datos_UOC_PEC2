COPIED E-MAILED MESSAGE/REPORT:   Hello Mr. Davenport,   It was nice to speak with you tonight about my sighting.  My name is ((deleted)).  I’m an Airline Pilot, based in Salisbury, MD.  I’ve flown for three different airlines, and corporate operations since 1988. Tonight at 2048 local time I witnessed an equilateral triangle shaped object, due north of my position, moving east. The corners of the triangle were defined by reddish-orange orbs of light.  It made no sound that I could hear, and appeared to roll about its longitudinal axis, so that I was observing the object edge on. I was observing the object from PGH, the local hospital, and it seemed to be about 5 to 10 statute miles away. I will attach a photo.  I hope this helps with any investigation that may ensue. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be quite sincere and sober-minded.  We suspect that he is a skilled, and highly reliable, witness.  PD))  ((name deleted));38.3689147058824;-75.5954852941175
