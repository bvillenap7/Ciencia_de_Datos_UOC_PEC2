Sighting of a huge, diamond shape UFO in Maryland.;2003-11-15 21:00:00;10 seconds;Sighting of a huge, diamond shape UFO in Maryland. I was sitting in my living room watching tv. I had just sat down when i saw something out of the corner of my eye from the window. I jumped off the couch and looked out the window. I only had like seven seconds to see it but it was huge! It was a diamond shape and it had lights on each corner. I think it also had another light in the middle but i am not positive. It was huge though and it was fast. It flew over my house exstreamly quickly. Way quicker than any plane I have ever seen and with my father being retiered Air Force i knew my planes. I also knew that there is no planes or jets that regularly fly over my house. I am not a scientist so I cannot determine the hight or exact speed or size it was but i know it was huge and fast. I have seen a UFO on a previous occasion but it was not as close or as big as the one i just saw. After I lost sight of the craft I ran back into my dad's study and told him what I saw. He did not believe me but he said he had heard something like a sonic boom but not quiet the same. It was very amazing.;38.3689147058824;-75.5954852941175
