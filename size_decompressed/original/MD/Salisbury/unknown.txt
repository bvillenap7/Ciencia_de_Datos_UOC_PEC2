It was blueish white and radiated from a single point. Cloud coverage was low so we didnt see any distinctive vehicle. 2 or 3 seconds later we heard a distant deep clap of thunder, and it was structured like a sonic boom, but much deeper. there was increased flight traffic in the area for the next 2.5 hours.Also i heard my first jetsabout 2 or 3 minutes after the flash. they were there pretty quick, but DAFB is at least a 8-10min scramble to get that far south, leading me to believe our planes were already aware of the situation.;38.3689147058824;-75.5954852941175
