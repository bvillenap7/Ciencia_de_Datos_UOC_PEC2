We had to had the direction of where I saw them to get to our destination and while stopped at a intersection, we BOTH saw them at a different part of the western sky.  We look at each other and went on about our business.;38.3689147058824;-75.5954852941175

Reddish-orange light flying east to west after Salisbury, MD, fireworks.;2015-05-07 21:40:00;1 minutes;Reddish-orange light flying east to west after Salisbury, MD, fireworks. On July 5th, 2015, in Salisbury, Maryland, shortly after the 4th of July fireworks finished at approx. 9:40 pm, my brother, nephew and I saw a reddish-orange light traveling east to west at a constant speed.  The light resembled the red navigation light on a small plane but had more of an orange tint to it.  We watched the light until it faded from view, approx. one minute. The light was the size of the navigation lights on a single engine airplane flying at the altitude these airplanes normally fly at. We are familiar with aircraft lights as we live one mile from the Salisbury Airport and grew up just outside of Andrews AFB.  This light was unlike any aircraft light we are familiar with. Other aircraft were seen landing at the Salisbury Airport earlier that evening.  This did not resemble those at all. This light resembled a red light I saw over the Atlantic Ocean in November 2014. I videotaped and photographed this light.;38.3689147058824;-75.5954852941175
