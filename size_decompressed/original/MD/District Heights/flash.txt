Helicopters do not sit in the sky like that and it was two small planes circling uneath it around and around 45 min later it move it started like gliding around like it was going to land and then i could not see it anymore and then it came back right in the same spot for another 15 to 20 minutes and then it vanish and it was gone.  President Obama was addressing the nation that night.  I understand he went to Andrews AFB the next day cause i heard it on the news.  No one believes me plus smoke came from it and it was round ring of smoke i look out the window every night every since this happen.   I seen a ufo back in 1973 in the mid west and that was in the daytime. This what i saw is true ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
