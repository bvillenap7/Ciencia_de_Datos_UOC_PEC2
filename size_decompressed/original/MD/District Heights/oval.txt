I regret not jotting down the actual date that I spotted a UFO in the 2nd week of August 2016.  I didn’t think it was anything, until someone encouraged me that I wasn’t “seeing things” that didn’t exist. I was walking the dog at approximately 6:30 pm.  I saw an oval shape that shone like a very bright star.  It moved at a speed faster than a jet, or anything I’ve ever seen, and it didn’t have a smoke trail.   I stood and watched until it went out of sight.  It was way above the clouds.  Usually when I see planes that high, I see a smoke trail and the speed appears to be somewhat slow.  The speed is what caught my eye. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD));38.8534;-76.8892999999999
