The craft was first visible in the clouds and I could only see the lights rotating under the craft.   Once the craft came into the clear sky I could see the craft very clearly.  It looked like it was made from heat vapors like u would see on a hot day on the road in the distance.  The craft was heading towards Andrews Air Force Base and there were a couple of planes in the sky and one helicopter.  They seemed not to notice the craft, but seems like the craft notice them.  The craft decreased its speed and then the 2 dim lights under the craft went out.  And that's when I could see the actual shape of the craft which was almost directly over my head. The craft was circular in shape and it was totally black with no reflection or sound. Just when I thought the helicopter and the other planes in the sky were going to notice it.   Then 5 lights appeared on both sides of the craft in the shape of a two half moons, one on each side of the craft, and flickered like a Morris code.  One long and somewhere between 5 to 6 short flickers.   Then then craft went black and the 2 dim lights under the craft reappeared and started rotating in a circular motion and then the craft continued its course.   The further away the craft got, the harder it was to see until it was not visible anymore. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
