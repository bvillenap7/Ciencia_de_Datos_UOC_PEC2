Triangular aircraft.;2005-06-24 22:00:00;1 minute;Triangular aircraft. I was the passenger in a car, looking out the front window at the sky. The street was lined with very large trees and I was looking at the point where the trees intersected with the sky. There was suddenly a gap in the trees and I saw a large triangular thing with lights on the bottom hovering there not too far off of the ground. I immediately told the person driving to stop but we could not see past the trees. We turned around and slowly drove back looking for another gap in the trees. For a second I saw the triangular aircraft again. It was unlike any plane that ive ever seen. I know that there is an airport in the area but I have lived in this neighorhood for 2 years now and I have never seen an airplane fly over the neighborhood, especially one that looked like that.;38.9958617021276;-76.938570212766
Two triangle UFOs were spotted, one followed a commercial plane for a few seconds.;2016-08-07 04:09:00;20 minutes;Two triangle UFOs were spotted, one followed a commercial plane for a few seconds. Two triangle shaped UFOs were spotted hovering around in the sky.  Each UFO had 3 white lights and occasionally a red light was seen.  They hovered in the sky and rotated as if they were scanning the earth.  At one point, a commercial plane flew by and one of the UFOs followed it for a few seconds before returning back to its spot to hover around.  As daylight approached, the UFOâ€™s seemed to get more and more distant until they disappeared.;38.9958617021276;-76.938570212766
