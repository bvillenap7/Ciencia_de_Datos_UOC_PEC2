Heard booms, saw flashes, and sky was green in that direction;2001-04-11 12:00:00;several minutes;Heard booms, saw flashes, and sky was green in that direction I remember it was the middle of the Spring semester in 2001 at the University of Maryland, and i had gone to sleep an hour earlier.  The sky was partly cloudy that night and it seemed a bit hazy. I was awakened by soft booms and went to the window to investigate.  I saw flashes of light on the horizon, as i didnt have a real good view, but they were all coming from the southeast, perhaps towards the Andrews Air Force Base area.  These flashes were not in the sky, but on or under my field of view, as there was a stadium in the way.  I think the booms corresponded to the flashes being made, but as i could not determine what they were, i went back to sleep.  I however couldnt sleep, as the booms still took place every few minutes (perhaps i heard 15-25 in all), and later i got up to the window again, the booms and the flashes were still there but a bright green cloud/haze was in the southeast direction. I'm pretty sure there still could be a rational explanation to what i saw, but i could never figure it out. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.
