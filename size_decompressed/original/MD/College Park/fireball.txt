Big Green Ball of Light Falling over College Park, MD on December, 11 2004  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor.  PD));2004-12-11 20:00:00;2 seconds;Big Green Ball of Light Falling over College Park, MD on December, 11 2004 I put 8 pm as the time, but it could have been anywhere between 7 and 10.  I was in the shopping center down on Baltimore Ave. across the street from Cornerstone Bar.  I was walking out of the video store there when I saw it.  It happend so fast all could say was Holy sh_t!  What's that?  By the time my friend turned around to look it was gone.  I'm not sure if I actually saw a UFO but I looked up and saw a falling green ball of light.  I didn't consider that it would be a UFO unti I typed 'green ball of light' into google to see if anyone else had seen it and all the 'green ball of light' results were described as UFOs.  I'm not sure how far away it was.  It was falling in the same way that a falling star would fall, but it was too big and too green to be a falling star.  I wondered for a second if it was a bomb.  I repented and waited, but there was (obviously) no big explosion.  I'm really curious if anyone else saw this.  Please post if you did.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor.
