Three lights... first 2 then 3... formed triangle;2014-04-11 21:00:00;5 minutes;Three lights... first 2 then 3... formed triangle Three glowing lights not similar to aircraft lights,  lightly orange in color.  This happened about a month ago.   I was on a smoke break over looking the golf course outside the clubs grill bar.  I believe I witnessed something when I was 16 so when I saw the light I thought, Hey, what the heck, check it out.   There was one very bright solid orange light possibly oscillating a but it could have been various environmental factors and IMHO too far away to get any detail.  The first light was then followed by a 2nd which made me think I was looking at an aircraft route, but then there was a dance.  The front light shifted right and the the 2nd left.  When my manager came out I grabbed her.  She wasn't interested and I was going to be the weirdo pushing the subject.   Shortly thereafter the objects were joined by a third which made it more interesting because they seemed to form a triangle from my angle.  The whole thing was very cool and I did take pic on my iPhone.  *granted I wasn't that close so its nothing highly credible but I think it's worth mentioning/showing.
