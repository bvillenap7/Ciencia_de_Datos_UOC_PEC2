Series of strange orange lights (independent/multi-directional) moving over treeline.;2014-09-10 21:30:00;45 seconds;Series of strange orange lights (independent/multi-directional) moving over treeline While driving northeast on Route 610 through Whaleyville, my passenger saw a few strange lights on the horizon above the treeline.  I immediately pulled over and we both watched as the orangish lights moved slowly and independently of one another. At first, we saw what appeared to be three different objects.  There was one in the center which appeared stationary.  To its left, there was another object/set of lights moving towards it.  To the right of the center object, there was another object/set of lights that was moving towards the center.  The rightmost object/set of three lights slowly moved downward and disappeared behind the treeline.  The leftmost object/series of lights disappeared while as we were watching it in the sky.  The center object flashed and its lights seemed to rearrange in configuration.  Then it flashed and went out.  My passenger said that when she first saw the lights, the left and right objects/series of lights left a little contrail or little sparks. I did not see that part. There was no sound that we could discern from the objects. We estimate we were about a half a mile to one mile from the treeline. The night sky was clear, only a low ground fog. Odd notes: after the lights were gone, we heard a screaming noise coming from the open field.  Possibly a fox or injured animal but it sure was creepy!   I also had to try three or four times to get my car to start to back up.  I don't think this is really attributed to the event, though, as my car has had this issue in the past.;38.4102;-75.2765
