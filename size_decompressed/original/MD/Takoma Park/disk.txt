I, my best friend, and her little brother were walking at night to go to a local store (7-11) a half mile away.  We cut through our neighborâ€™s back yard and into a park.  As we were walking through the park surrounded by trees,  a huge disc the size of a condensed helicopter with rotating iridescent flashing lights (as a strip around the craft), swooped in and hovered above us.  It was hovering at about 5 stories high, right above the trees.   We all looked at it and screamed and proceeded to run while looking back.  As we began to run, we saw the craft zip into the sky and disappear.   Me and my best friend were only 14 at the time and never forgot what we had seen.  We still talk about it to this day we are now 32. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
