Three white crafts sped off one after another in different directions faster than any jet plane i have ever seen;1973-08-15 22:00:00;5 minutes;Three white crafts sped off one after another in different directions faster than any jet plane i have ever seen The following is another incredible U.F.O. sighting I experienced in 1973 about august at 10:00 pm on a clear night.  My brother was outside in the front yard looking straight up when he called for me to come outside. He pointed out three white points of light that did look like stars but slightly larger and they were in a triangle formation close together that appeared to be in a higher orbit than a regular 747 passenger jet.  We continued to observe those three points of lights for about five minutes when suddenly, one of those crafts sped off with a streak behind it and disappeared in a second leaving the other two behind. Then two seconds later the second craft sped off in the same manner as the first into a completely different direction leaving the last one behind.  And two seconds later the last craft sped off in the same manner as the first two crafts into a completely different direction, and no sound whatsoever could be heard.
