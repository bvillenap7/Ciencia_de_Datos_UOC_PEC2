Zoom in on pic I was looking up to see the moon and was waiting for a cloud to move.  When the moon came into view I also noticed a flickering light underneath the moon that was very bright and seemed to be still.  I took a picture and brief video.  (Please see attachments)  Then when I looked at the object it looked like it was moving in my direction, so I hurried inside because I was feeling nervous.  I put the video and picture on my computer and will include it.  It just looks like a bright light from a  distance but when I zoomed in on it in video and picture a horse shoe or u shaped light can be seen.  Please let me know your thoughts.  If its something more common like a plane, please let me know because it really freaked me out!  Thanks!;38.9816;-77.0044
