3 bright oranges red orbs of light floating  over the city.;2014-08-15 21:40:00;10 minutes;3 bright oranges red orbs of light floating  over the city U.F.O sighting occurred on August 15, 2014.  I was on Carroll Avenue between Carroll and Ethan Allen Avenue.  The event lasted around 10 minutes from 9:40pm until 9:50pm.  I was not the only one who witnessed these objects there was a women there she looked to be of Ethiopian decent she also saw the objects. The Objects in question were three large bright orange almost sun colored objects with no distinguishable shape.  They really just looked like floating orbs of light. They were moving in a manner that I have never seen before and were impossible for any Earth based terrestrial aircraft to achieve. At times the objects would just completely disappear from sight and then reappear in a completely different location to far away for any normal aircraft to achieve with known technology.  At times they would travel in a straight vertical motion in a way that only a rocket would be able to move and move directly at one another one coming down and the other going up and then meeting in the middle. Eventually all three U.F.O left the atmosphere traveling straight up in the air and then eventually the light just disappear not because they were too high to see but just out of nowhere the light just vanished.;38.9816;-77.0044
