Explosion and fireball experienced by entire community;2019-01-01 00:30:00;30 seconds;Explosion and fireball experienced by entire community An explosion that shook houses strongly enough to have things fall from shelves was accompanied by a huge fireball near the sight lines possibly north east of the zip location. Residents of approximately 25 homes experienced this and all homeowners have looked for news report explanations but cannot find any mention of it.  Some in the community are fire and police, and their sources do not report anything in their agencies.  The entire community was deeply shaken by the explosion and fireball, most certainly by the resolute denial of our collective experience of 25 or so entire families.
