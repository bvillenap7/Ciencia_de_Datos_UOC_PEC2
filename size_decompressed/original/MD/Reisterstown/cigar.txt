While I was looking up I heard a plane coming across, I looked up an noticed a white airplane flying (which is not normal for that time in the morning.   So I thought  was odd (because I work on site at the airport and I know only restricted flights are flying.  So after watching this plane for a second I noticed a bright star getting closer to the plane.  I watched it and that bright star flew directly across the plane about 3,000 feet above  The star didn't make any noise like the plane had done as it passes over me seconds after crossing over the white plane.  I watched the star continue on its flight plan until I couldn't watch it anymore.    Seconds after that, I dropped my keys while watching the craft,  I bent over in total darkness to find my keys!  And I heard 2 loud engine jets going across my home, but I couldn't see them because they were 2 fast and my tree was blocking the view while I was looking for the keys,  when I stood up the jets were gone;39.4527;-76.8152
