flying fire ball in baltimore county, maryland;2001-04-20 02:33:00;3 sec;flying fire ball in baltimore county, maryland i had just came home from a trip to ocean city and was sitting outside of my house with a few of my friends. we had been sitting outside for just a few moments when we herd a strange high pitched hum comming from the sky. we steped of my porch and saw a firey like object flying in the sky. it looked like it could have been a plane crashing but it was going straight at a tremendous speed. many of my friends said it was just a shooting star, but what kind of star makes a noise. the object was fairly big and looked to be very high in the sky. it appered to me as if the ship was entering our atmosphere and was burning on entery.
