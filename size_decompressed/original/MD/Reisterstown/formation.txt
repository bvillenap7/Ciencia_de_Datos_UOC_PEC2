Duration was so long, we went back to playing volleyball after about 20 mins.  The sun was getting lower in sky toward setting, seemed to be illuminating the underside of the craft.  Best guess is they would have been transparent had the sun not have been hitting them at this angle.   Speed/height/size hard to tell ...but there were hundreds, moving silently, some in formational clusters, others solo.  All perfect halo shaped oval craft. Toward end of event, the quantity of craft began to get less and less. **I believe a similar event was sighted another another individual in the last few years a few miles from our location.;39.4527;-76.8152
