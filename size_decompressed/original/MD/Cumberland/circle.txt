Rotating bright colored orb appears two nights with different behaviors.;2014-08-30 23:55:00;5 minutes;Rotating bright colored orb appears two nights with different behaviors. This is a two night sighting, one on 8/30/14 and another similar sighting on 8/31/14. 8/30 Stargazing and looking to the east we see airplanes. An object catches my friends eye to the west-northwest (northwest of Cumberland, toward PA), a few miles out, about 5 degrees or less above the horizon is a glowing, rotating and flashing brightly, an orb like object moving at about 100 knots to the north.  The object comes to a halt, pauses all movement for at least 20-30 seconds and changes direction exact opposite of its heading, still clearly rotating and displaying an array of colors from white, blue, red and orange.  The object suddenly vanishes after about 2-3 minutes of observation. 8/31 at approximately the same time, zero dark hundred hours, (note: we are now equipped with nikon hunting binoculars, very good quality for night hunting) an object appears to the west many miles out, in a hovering posture 10-15 degrees above the horizon, displaying a similar array of colors and what would appear to be rotating.  The object dims and reappears, eventually becoming very bright with a wild display of colors and then disappearing.  About 10-15 minutes later, the object reappears, now 5 degrees above the horizon, closer than before, displaying an extreme brightness of rotating colors, and dimming, it is clearly rotating from our view in the binoculars, and after about 2 minutes the object becomes very very bright and then vanishes before our eyes.
