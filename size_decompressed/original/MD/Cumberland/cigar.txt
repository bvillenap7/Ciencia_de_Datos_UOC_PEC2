I took off my sunglasses and still saw a cigar shaped object aprox 300 or 400 feet long.  Basically the color was grey and seemed to fade in and out while emitting no sound.  It appeared to be about 1000 yards away, moving slowly and aprox 1/4 mile above ground.   After a short while the object became very visible and shot away at a speed that was unbelievable.  I and my wife and myself observed possible UFO's in Pa in the late 80's but not of this sort.  This was not an imagination event or a mistaken plane, this was the real thing.  I had dropped my clippers and looked around for anyone else, but no one was present.  I was shaken but believed what I saw and knew again that we wern't by ourselves.;39.5995;-78.8461000000001
