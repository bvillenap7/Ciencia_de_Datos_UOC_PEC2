I remember seeing 2 of the brightest lights on this object that seemed like huge headlights.  This object came straight toward my yard and made a pivot turn in the sky and headed toward downtown cumberland.  I remember the two bright headlights, many other lights and a bright blue strobing light that i think was ontop of the object.  I ran up my alley called bond st. following this object.  My children drew pictures that resembled airplanes with many lights on the bottom.  Their friend Ashley drew a pic of an oval object with 2 headlights with somekind of rope thing hanging off the backend of it.  I remember the sound of this thing reminded me of a jet engine but was not loud at all and if you were up the street you probably couldn't have heard it.;39.5995;-78.8461000000001
