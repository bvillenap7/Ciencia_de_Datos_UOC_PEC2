A bright V-shaped stationary object in the northwest night sky.;2015-02-23 19:00:00;20-25 minutes;A bright v shaped stationary object in the northwest night sky. I heard a helicopter flying low over my house and went out to see what was going on.  I saw the helicopter and then noticed a bright v-shaped light/object in the northwest sky, around 30 degrees above the mountains.  It appeared to be emitting light beneath it.   I viewed it from several locations in my yard and it looked the same.  I got my son (20) and wife and they also saw it.  It was brighter and twice as big as anything else I could see.   I went inside after about 20 minutes and looked online to see if anyone else was reporting it.   I went out about 10 minutes later and it was gone, although a bright star that was under and to the right of it was still visible.
