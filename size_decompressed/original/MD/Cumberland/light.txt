Damned comp wouldnt accept time of 1730, just starting to get dark, but not enough for stars. A few puffy clouds.  One cloud, however, was black & puffy at one end & rectangular at the other.  Too early for stars, but visible near black were 3 lights, color of incandescent.  Suddenly from the black cloud came, like a yo-yo another light & zipped back into the black cloud.  The 3 lights origanally visibile had not moved, but the triangle they formed was larger than the black cloud.   As soon as the yo-yo light had returned to the mother ship the other 3 lights moved to the black cloud & were engulfed.  Wife & I watched until we climbed the mountain on the other side & never saw another light.;39.5995;-78.8461000000001

Stunned to what I seen. Bright. Semi stationary light. Very bright. Seen no form. Just the light.;2012-10-12 20:00:00;6 to 10 seconds;Stunned to what I seen. Bright. Semi stationary light.  Very bright. Seen no form. Just the light. I live in one of the last houses in the narrows.  My window faces south south east and can see the ridge on other side of the narrows. The opposite ridge line is only about 100 to 200 above the railroad tracks. Very low for something to be floating or flying.  Only birds.  On the moments before I seen the unknown a flash got my attention to the window which offers a wide view to other side of the narrows. My living room lights were off and was watching t v.   As I was staring out to direction of bright flash a large white- bluish light appeared. My first thought was.  That's not normal.  The bright &quot0rb&quot seemed to come to edge of ridge line from my point of view.  It then stayed stationary briefly.  Long enough to throw my senses off.  The light or orb moved slightly to the left.  Stopped.  Then moved to left again.  Stopped.   By this time it was blocked slightly by trees on the alley I live on.  But was still visible and bright.it had stopped again.  No plane does! this.i served in air force in viet man and have a great understanding of flight characteristics of both military and commercial craft.  This in a matter of mere seconds had me shocked. At the last moment of getting up and straining to look out window the light turned from more of a bright white off blue too a all blue light.  It then vanished.  I was shocked because for a second I thought the light was from landing lights on a approaching aircraft.  And was coming straight toward me.after the event I thought to myself. The light was too bright to have been landing lights!!!!  I also tryed to tell myself it is explainable.  I have no idea as to what it was. And I was thinking. Somebody else had to see this.  I decided not to call police. Now a few days after experience I went on the net to see about weird sights in Maryland sky's. Was shocked to see that other reports and the same sounding object I had witnessed. That is how I found this web site to report this. Did not know one ! could do that. What are the odds of seeing something like this! outside my window. Scary. This did happen. I hope someone reads this and can interpret what I saw. And why?!!;39.5995;-78.8461000000001
Hovering flashing object with sudden movement;2012-10-20 22:30:00;30 minutes;Hovering flashing object with sudden movement Noticed a flashing light at first I thought it was a star but it continued to flash and then made very fast movement and then hovered again and flashed.  Then I noticed two more but were either smaller or farther away but hovering as well.  It lasted about half hour and seemed to stop when an airplane came in the direction.;39.5995;-78.8461000000001
Orange orb.;2016-09-16 21:40:00;1 minute;I saw an orange orb while looking out my window.  I only saw it for a minute because of the rooftops nearby.  It was about as bright as Jupiter or the international space station.  It was headed roughly towards the east, and covered about 10 degrees of the sky in the duration of the sighting.  It was clearly under an overcast sky.  This and it's direction of travel rules out the space station.  It was a steady orange-white color.  The steady glow and calm air (I went outside to see if the wind was blowing in that direction) rules out Chinese lanterns.
