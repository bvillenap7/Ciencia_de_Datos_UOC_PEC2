Transparent Bowl-Shaped Craft - Cumberland, Maryland;2008-06-15 20:35:00;3 Minutes;Transparent Bowl-Shaped Craft - Cumberland, Maryland I was walking the mile oval dirt track at Allegany College in Cumberland, Maryland on June 15 at approx. 20:35. We live near a small airport (Cumberland Municipal) and my attention was drawn to the sky by a low flying two-engine aircraft. To my surprise, there was another object in the sky unlike any that I have ever seen. It was an almost transparent upside-down bowl-shaped craft. Underneath the craft was what appeared to be a thin solid 'line of light' discharging from the bottom of the 'bowl'. The light had the appearance of a fluorescent light (it could have been circular but from my point of view the light was a straight line). It should be noted that this object remained stationary in the sky. I thought it might be moving away from me, but it was not. It should also be noted that there was a full or ¾ full moon that evening, but this object was well away from the moon. I thought, 'Am I really seeing this?'. However, as I passed the tennis courts - with object still in full view - I heard a lady speaking to her husband saying, '...I don't know. I guess it's an alien invasion or something.' I said to her, 'Do you see that?' She stated, 'Yeah, it's really weird.' I agreed and kept walking (with the stationary object now over my left shoulder). As I turned back to look at the object again, it was gone. I could hardly contain myself until I reached the tennis courts again. I stopped and asked the lady, ‘Did that thing ever show itself?’ She walked over to me and very excitedly said, ‘Oh my God. That thing just vanished! It didn’t fly away it just vanished!’;39.5995;-78.8461000000001
