White fireball over rural Northwestern Montgomery County.;2005-10-31 21:30:00;30 seconds;White fireball over rural Northwestern Montgomery County. My friend and I was walking down a country road called Wasche Rd at nigh on Halloween.  I looked up and saw a bright white flash stream across the sky that was much bigger than a shooting star, aircraft, or satellite.  It had a hazy aura around it.  I am a Civil Air Patrol cadet and am very familliar with aircraft and have never seen one that makes no noise at what seemed to be a low altitude.;39.1339;-77.4103
