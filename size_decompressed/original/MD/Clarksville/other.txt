White ball shaped bright object whizzing across the holloween sky;2005-10-31 19:00:00;5 seconds;White ball shaped bright object whizzing across the holloween sky I was out trick or treating with my daughter and our neighbor and his daughter when we saw a bright white ball shaped light speed across the sky overhead. It was approximately 200 feet up and was traveling west to east, it didn't make any noise and after it crossed over us and it split into two and then the lights winked out. When it appeared I pointed it out to the my neighbor and all of the 30-50 people in our area trick or treating looked up and saw it as well. There was a story about it on WTOPNEWS.com that stated that it was a meteorite, but the story mentioned an orange and blue object and gave a time of 9:15pm.;39.2079;-76.9593
