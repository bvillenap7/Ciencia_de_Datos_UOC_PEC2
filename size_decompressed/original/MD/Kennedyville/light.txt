Mr. Davenport, I reported a sighting that occurred on 10/8/03.;2003-10-08 19:30:00;about an hour;Mr. Davenport, I reported a sighting that occurred on 10/8/03. You commented on the ufocenter website that you think that I may have observed celestial bodies. Could you please elaborate? Please note that there are 2 other sightings reported that night near me...one in Bel Air, MD  and one in Rising Sun, MD...(That is the direction I was looking while watching the ufo.) Also,  there is a body of water between Kennedyville ( me ) and Bel Air or Rising Sun There are really no other sightings in MD in October that I could find on your sight except for that night at the times the 3 separate reporters reported our sightings. Those times are very close together. There is one exception near Annapolis MD...... I would like to hear from the others who had sightings in Bel Air and Rising Sun that evening.  Could you arrange that? Feel free to give them my info. Thank you ((name and e-address deleted));39.2991;-75.9821
