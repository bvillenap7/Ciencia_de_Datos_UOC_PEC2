seemed to be practicing formations;2003-10-08 19:30:00;1 hour;seemed to be practicing formations It started out as 3 equally spaced orangish (amber)  lights diagonal formationed. The 3 lights went out at the same time.  Next, a large ball of orangish light appeared and 2 lights broke off into a horizontal formation.  They faded out again.  This went on for almost an hour.  Sometimes the ball would break off into a vertical formation while other times into a horizontal or diagonal formation. It would only stay visible for 5-6 seconds at a time.  The last 10 minutes were the most active. It broke off into a formation of 4 from the main ball of light ( all perfectly spaced ).  Then when it re-appeared it broke off into a formation of 5 lights.  And finally into a vertical formation of 6 equally spaced lights.  The main light would never moved once it appeared. Once each ball of light went to it's place in the formation, the formation stayed still for 5-6 seconds and then would fade out all at the same time. My wife went next door to tell our neighbors.  When the neighbors came out to see,  the craft(s) never revealed themselves again.  I have never seen anything like this before and neither has my wife.  The lights seemed to be no more than 1000 feet from the ground ( sometimes just above the tree line ). ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness may have observed celestial bodies.
