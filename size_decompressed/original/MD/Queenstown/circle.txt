It was still dark, moon was partially covered, & there were many stars in the sky.  While walking, I noticed a very bright light coming from the southern sky & assumed it was a plane or helicopter.  As I watched it, it was moving fairly fast & the closer it got, the brighter it got,  I then thought perhaps it was a plane in trouble, etc.  As it come closer, it was descending rapidly, & then passed maybe 1/2 mile in front of me, barely over the tree tops!!!  It was a round glowing white ball of light and had a tail attached to it.  It was moving fairly fast but was very distinctive.  It was so low that I thought it was going to hit our barn but it must have come down in a field close by.  I did not hear anything when it landed.  I woke my husband up & we noticed that in the sky there was a path or rather a band in the sky where this object had traveled from south to north.  Sort of like a vapor trail left by big jet aircraft.  Our question is, what would this have been?  I called the local airport, the FAA in Baltimore, & I got the impression that they thought I was a nut.  All I can say is that I am a professional person, in my forties, and this is the first time I have ever seen anything like this.  Please advise as to what this could have been.;39.0025;-76.1424
