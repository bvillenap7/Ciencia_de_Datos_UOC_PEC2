Many lights seen coming through the clouds they moved pretty fast and in no uniform pattern.  These lights stayed in the same area in the sky circled around changed directions and even came close to one another.  We thought at first that it may be search lights used for advertising.  no beams came from these lights from the ground.  They were above the clouds and just looked like glowing light playing tag.  They vanished little by little until one remained and vanished also. have no idea what these were all 3 of us are really wondering.  Tonight i will look out side again and see if they reappear.  These lights were seen from my home and i have never seen them before.  I have in this past year since what i thought a light zipping by but can't confirm because only a glimpse sighting.  last night they were hanging out for maybe 5 minutes when i first saw and gathered my husband and son to see.  Could you let me know if anyone else had seen these ?  E-MAIL AS PROVIDED BELOW??  thank you !!  yes our cat did respond to this event when he came out to look, he just looked out at them.;39.5133;-75.8389
