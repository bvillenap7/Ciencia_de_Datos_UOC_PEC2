Pictures and video of blue egg shaped orb.  ((NUFORC Note:  Lens flares, caused by pointing a camera at a bright source of light.  PD));2015-07-31 23:00:00;2-3 minutes;Pictures and video of blue egg shaped orb. I went out on my back patio to take pictures of the blue moon on 7/31/15 about 11:00 pm.   I took 4 pictures, and a few seconds of video.   I could not see it with the naked eye.  On both the pictures and the video, there is a blue egg shaped object.  It was in the sky between the moon and the tree line behind my neighborâ€™s house, then it landed behind the trees and then it took off again.  You can see a jet stream dissipating in the pictures.   In the video, again not noticeable to the naked eye, there is a blue orb quickly flying around. ((NUFORC Note:  Lens flares, caused by pointing a camera at a bright source of light.
