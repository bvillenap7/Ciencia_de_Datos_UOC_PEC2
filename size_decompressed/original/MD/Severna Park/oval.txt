I was walking my two dogs around 8:15pm in Severna Park, Maryland.   When I look at the sky at a very unusual set of lights that were not planes.   First around seven lights, that uniformely traveled together for about a minute and slowly disappeared one by one, at about 130 degrees South East.   I was stunned, so I stayed to see if there were any more lights coming.  In fact half a minute later four of them appeared slowly following the same route desapearing in the same location.   I waited again, and one more light like the others appeared once again going to the same location as the others.   The lights all looked the same.  They were orange-red in color and oval shape.  They did not blink at all and they all steadly traveled at the same speed and disappeared in the same point I mentioned earlier.;39.0809;-76.5590000000001
Hovering and phone video scrambled!  ((anonymous report));2017-07-21 12:30:00;~2 minutes;Hovering and phone video scrambled! I was at a red night with plenty of other cars and maybe a few thousand feet up was a aircraft I’ve never seen before.  It was hovering up and down and side to side.  It was so crazy to me (and everyone around was looking up at it) we’re looking at each other looking for answers and it held the whole light up.   I took my phone out and took a video a perfectly clear video with me commentating and everything.  When I went back later to show my wife, the phone was zoomed in on the corner with the aircraft not visible whatsoever.  You can hear me talking and explaining what we were looking at, but the camera was zoomed in somewhere else.  I know for an absolute 100% fact I took a GOOD video of the aircraft.  By far the most crazy unexplainable thing I’ve ever seen.  I’m not even into stuff like this but this was truly something out of this world.  It was HUGE, HOVERING in place with no wings or anything like that. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));39.0809;-76.5590000000001
