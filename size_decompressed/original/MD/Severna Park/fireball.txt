The ob;1993-06-01 14:00:00;9 seconds;Flaming object cross an open area between two tree lines, the object was just above the tree tops which are 60 to 100 feet tall.  The object crossed the opening  between the tree lines very slowly in about 4 (four) seconds, the object crossed the 150 foot opening between the two tree lines.  The object could then be seen flickering above and thru the second set of trees for about another 4 to 5 seconds before it could not be seen anymore.  The object was between the size of a VW bug and a Toyota Sienna I could not understand how gravity did not bring this object down as slow as it was moving and that is why, in my opinion, I believe it was some kind of powered craft which was on fire. Object was seen at my previous address in Severna Park,Maryland,21146.During the daylight hours.;39.0809;-76.5590000000001
