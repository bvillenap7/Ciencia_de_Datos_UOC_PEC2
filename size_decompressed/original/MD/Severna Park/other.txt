((HOAX??))  I could not aee the outside of the ship, but I know I was in one. ((anonymous report));2016-07-24 00:00:00;Unsure;I could not aee the outside of the ship, but I know I was in one. I am unsure as to whether or not I should be writing this, it feels very strange.  I am not crazy. I have a small orange salt lamp in my bedroom.   About two hours ago, I unplugged it because it was getting slightly hot and I wanted to sleep.  A few minutes after I unplugged the lamp, it turned back on, and got extremely bright.  I know it seems very stereotypical, but my entire room filled with light.   I don't remember much, but I will try to maybe update this later.  I remember having my right arm lifted as I lay on my back and dropped onto my chest.  That is all I remember.  This was not a dream.   I woke up in a different room of my house with the lights on.  I have experienced time loss in the past, but this was a whole new level.  I know this is a sighting website, but I figured that people in Maryland would like to know what may be going on and what may happen to them.   I am very scared right now, but I know I am safe.
