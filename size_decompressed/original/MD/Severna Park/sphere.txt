Orange spheres over Maryland.;2013-09-03 21:30:00;2 minutes;Orange spheres over Maryland Second time spheres have been seen in the sky over Severna Park Maryland. The sphere was red in color , translucent, with a bright orange fire like center.  The single object kept at a steady controlled speed about that of a plane at low altitude.  The object moved across the sky making no noise and had no other lights such as navigational lights.  The translucent outer sphere was that of a well defined ball of light.  It stayed on a controlled path from South to NNE direction before disappearing behind the treeline.  This object was witnessed by two individuals over our home this past winter.;39.0809;-76.5590000000001
Silent red spheres moving in single file across the sky in Severna Park Maryland.;2013-11-09 21:00:00;15 minutes;Silent red spheres moving in single file across the sky in Severna Park Maryland. Driving home from dinner with my wife and noticed reddish spheres floating across the sky. We live near BWI airport so planes are a normal thing to see over the neighborhood, but these were a bit slower and brighter and were silent.  They appeared from the southwest and were traveling in the same path moving to the northeast.   I video taped them with my cell phone and when they all passed we ran into a neighbor who was in their yard with company and they all said they saw the same thing but that they were coming from the direction of the moon.   They started out a brilliant red and would turn to a fainter shade of red and then white.  As they passed overhead it seemed that their color became less pronounced.
