We are confused by that fact. PD))    I was starting to doze off durring the david letterman show. i was awaken by a repetitive sound kinda resembling a phone of the hook but alot louder and definitely more profound.as i started to rise up off the couch i noticed it took a great deal of effort as if i was drugged or something. Ofcourse i wasn't, but the physical feeling of a struggle to raise up off the couch was definitely present. As i could only sit i couldnt stand still have no clue as to why. i noticed the woods behind my house was completely illuminated as if there were flood lights on or a landing light on a helicopter as if it was searching. I know for a fact it wasn't any rotory aircraft. I also recall as if i was very cold and started to develop goosebumps in a big way. Eventually i was able to force myself to stand up. Only took me about 5 or 6 minutes to push myself up and walk over to the double french doors which lead to our sun patio. as i stood by the window the light faded with a slight flicker then was gone. Now im not quite sure how much time has past since this first inccident to the 2nd but, it wasnt too long after. I had made myself go to sleep in my beedroom.  I was awaken by the same erie noise as before except this time its directly out front and above my room windows. I have 3 windows in my room 2 large windows in the front and one smaller window on the side over top of my garage. Whatever this light was, shining thru my windows as if to see or whatever . I just knew somehow or for somereason this wasnt right. I knew enough to stay outa the lights. i do remember a chilly, cold like heat coming from outside, kinda like a vapor rub type wind. i know it sounds strange but thats the best way to explain it. almost menthol like. i wasnt able to yell but i was able to move and walk better this time . So being the wimp that i am i hid in my closet like a freak and never told anyone about it til now.  I woke up in the morning in my closet to a beautiful day. Even though for days i havent been able to sleep alone. This really scared the crap outa me.  Mr.D, When I made this post, I was unaware of the time allotment. This happened to me quite some time ago. It wasn't recent. It took a long time for me to even get the courage to really come forward to post this. I heard about this site a few years ago and didn't take notice of my mistake. This event happend on June 20th 1989. I beg of you to please let me know if anyone ever had an experience simular to this one in your experience. It is something I desperately wish to have some answers on. Everytime i think about the noise i heard. i get goosebumps and feel exactly the way i did that night and the night after.;39.0809;-76.5590000000001
