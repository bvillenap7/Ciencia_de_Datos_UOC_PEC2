4 glowing orange spherical objects viewed, flying in some type of formation.;2011-12-16 22:59:00;5 minutes;4 glowing orange spherical objects viewed, flying in some type of formation. I am an aerospace engineer and licensed private pilot, on my way home on Rt. 97 heading south, around the Highs Gas Station I saw four glowing orange spherical objects, definitely not a small plane or any aircraft I have ever seen before.  There was one object in the lead, followed by 3 other objects in a triangular formation.  All objects moved very slowly across my field of view to the left.   After being in shock of what I was seeing and pulling the car over, I tried for about a minute to snap photos on my cell phone but I was not able to get the objects into focus.  I put down my cell phone to watch the objects disappear into a slight faint pinpoint type glow.  Objects appeared to be at several thousand feet, I figure possibly someone could have launched some type of flare or firework and maybe this is what I saw burnout, however while I was watching these objects I didnt see parachute or anything that would have suspended them in the air.  And the objects didnt appear to be burning, just glowing orange.   The weather appeared as a hazy like overcast, aviation weather reports an Overcast to Broken cloud layer at 10,000 feet and 10 SM visibility, I believe the overcast clouds and haze had an effect on how I viewed the objects.   If someone could help me understand what I just saw that would be appreciated.;39.3202;-77.0102
