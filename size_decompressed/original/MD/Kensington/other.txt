Object seen in kensington solid slow pulsing light twinkie shaped.;2019-08-19 04:00:00;5 seconds;Object seen in kensington solid slow pulsing light twinkie shaped. i got up from sleep to go to the bathroom afterwards i was looking out the third floor window at the woods in back of the house looking for nocturnal animals.  i saw a blink out of the corner of my right eye and immediately thought it was a lightning bug because it was in the tree line.  Then there was a much larger blink that had the shape of a twinkie. It pulsed about like a light on the top of a tower.  Not rapid like collision lights on a jet.   There was a low cloud cover and whatever this was was slightly in the clouds, low.  We live in the flight path for Reagan nat airport so i am used to seeing commercial aircraft.  Usually in fog the aircraft turn on their landing lights.  I think i have seen a plane where the collision avoidance lights strobed together, although what i saw moved slow and pulsed slowly and the whole object was the same brightness.  There was no noise and it was low probably 600 feet AGL.  No navigation lights either. also the path that it was traveling i should have seen it sooner b/c it would have gone in front of me which it just sort of started it pulse run to my right.;39.0339;-77.083
