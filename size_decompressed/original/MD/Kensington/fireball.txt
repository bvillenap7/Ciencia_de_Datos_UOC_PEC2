At first I thought it was a plane/helicopter as there is a lot of air traffic in this area.  Then I realized no blinking lights, just a bright, solid orange color.  It was moving steadily, but then a small blue light broke off and burned out.  Then the orange fireball appeared to slow down to an almost stop.  It moved in a slightly different direction, then disappeared.;39.0339;-77.083
