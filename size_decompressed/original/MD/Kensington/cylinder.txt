Large, oval shaped very bright, white light (like a flash bulb) object, about 150 feet above us;2000-06-09 22:15:00;2 seconds;Large, oval shaped very bright, white light (like a flash bulb) object, about 150 feet above us While my husband & I were sitting on the deck there was suddenly a very bright flash, as if someone took a flash picture.  At the same time was looking at a large, submarine shaped (though it could have been tilted) object about 150 feet above our heads.  It flashed and then disappeared, no sound.  There is no explanation for this object of light...no car lights, flashlights, anything could have made this bright, brgight flash.  There is no answer to the shape & size of the object seen.  Though we are on the flight path to National, there was no noise and the object was so low and large and disappeared so suddenly that there was no way it was a plane.  I think it may have left a little trail though that may have been just the movement.;39.0339;-77.083
