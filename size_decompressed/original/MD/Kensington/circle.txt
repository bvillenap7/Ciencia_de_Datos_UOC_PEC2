Curious as to what they were, stars or planets, I finished putting out the trash, continued to stare at them and went inside to look online about them. Finding nothing, I took my camera out to try to photograph them. At 8:50 or 8:51 I was back out and there they were, but immediately began to lightly hover, the bottom two most notably. Then all four seemingly distant stars started to move at perfectly measured intervals from each other. The bottom two performed a strange half circular manoeuvre with each other and then quickly followed - perfectly straight and completely quiet- the first two objects.  Their pace was powerful and seemed to have a forcefulness about them that you do not sense when watching airplanes/jets.  They had no blinking lights.;39.0339;-77.083
