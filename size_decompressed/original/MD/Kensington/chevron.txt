Object appeared over trees coming at me from the east, raesembling in shape, size, speed and apparent altitude a v-formation of geese, with I estimate four lights on each side, each light considerably larger/brighter than an average star. The object appeared at about 30 degrees above the horizon, approached to nearly overhead while slowly turning -- apparently banking -- left, or south. As it did so the lights slowly faded and  disappeared. There is often air traffic in the sky -- we are in the approach patterns for Baltimore-Washington International and Reagan National airports -- but there were no other aircraft in the sky at the time that I recall. Unlike aircraft this object displayed no blinking navigation lights and made no sound whatsoever. Difficult to estimate altitude, but I would guess about 800 feet or more. At no time was anything other than the lights visible. I am an experienced observer, a military journalist I am familiar with al! l kinds of aircraft. This report was delayed by skepticism, but it defies conventional explanation.;39.0339;-77.083
