Sphere flying with Parent Aircraft.;2017-02-23 12:00:00;All day;Sphere flying with Parent Aircraft Very fast and round sphere flying through the sky in Abingdon, Maryland.  Video the sphere and picture is the escort plane flying next to it.  Another above average temperature along with breathtaking sunsets observed in Maryland on, February 23.  As I have been reporting since January 28 after experiencing and reporting a very directed vibrating current sound that affected myself and one other person, there has been a measurable increase in aircraft activity daily.  Today, I observed more activity in the couple hours leading up to sunset than I ever had up until this point.   I'm hoping someone can help answer some questions about all of this.;39.4799;-76.2955
