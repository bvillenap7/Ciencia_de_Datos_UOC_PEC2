However it was longer, and it didn't fade out like a shooting star normally does. it went through my field of vision in about 2 seconds. i jumped up and from my angle saw it farther to my left. I started thinking in my head what it could be. My wife asked what was wrong, and I explained that i thought i might have seen a UFO, in the traditional sense, i could not explain what it was. We were talking about for a few minutes, trying to debunk what I had seen. Then we heard screaming.....it was very chilling.  We cracked our bedroom window and heard it over and over. it sounded artificial, not like a human, so we started guessing it was an owl perhaps?  i don't know what they sound like, but i have heard there are some that make wild ass noises. Then about 2 minutes later, we heard a swarm of sirens go past our neighborhood and off to the east, where the light had gone. I wish I was more prepared and had more than just a story to share. So question, where can I find out if there is to be a meteor shower?  Is there some website that records this information?   2ndly, is there any type of owl that makes a screaming noise like a human?   The answers to those questions would set my mind at ease.
