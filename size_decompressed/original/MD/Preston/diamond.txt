Anyone else see it? We were driving home in the middle of nowhere when we looked up in the sky and saw 2 huge bright lights directly in front of my car.  It was not moving at all and seemed to be very low to the ground.  I thought it was a ufo so I stopped the car and looked out my window to get a better view.   As soon as i stopped the car the craft began moving, but at an extremely slow speed.  It was making absolutely no sounds which was so wierd because of how low it was flying.   As is slowly passed directly over my car I could see that it was in the shape of a diamond with 4 bright lights, one on each corner, but i could not really see and structure in between them.   As it moved past us to the east, with out any obvious changeover at all the light started moving in an oval shape very randomly. they were now red green and white and were very flashly.   In this way until it disappeared into the distance after about 10-15 minutes.    Did anyone else see this??;38.7466;-75.912
