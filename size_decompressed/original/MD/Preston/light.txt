I witnessed a star like light moving across the sky faster than any airplane and thought I was witnessing a meteor at first and called my daughter outside to see it.  It then changed direction as it passed by what I believe is the North Star (brightest star in the sky this night)  It changed from a north direction to a north west direction.  As we watched it more it changed direction again to the west, then back to the direction I originally saw it come from.  It traveled as I said pretty fast, much faster than a plane, then as it headed back to where I originally saw it, it seemed to just vanish, like it went from very fast to light speed or something.  The light looked exactly like a dim star as you would see in the sky on any given night.  No flashing, just a white solid light.  It was very high up possibly in space even, made no sound as it passed over.;38.7466;-75.912
