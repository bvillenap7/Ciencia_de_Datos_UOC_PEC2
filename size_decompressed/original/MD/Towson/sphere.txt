Red orbs of light over tree tops.  ((anonymous report));2009-06-30 20:00:00;5 minutes;Red orbs of light over tree tops. I was sitting on my porch with my boyfriend and a red orb of light slowly crept up over the tree line approx. 300 ft from me.  Once it reached about 150 feet from me, it just disappeared very quickly.   This happened 4 more times in succession.  My boyfriend said it was def a UFO sighting.   I tried to photograph it, but it wouldn't show up well on my phone camera, so I just watched it happen. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

white sphere flew silently over the house;2009-12-12 02:10:00;5 seconds;white sphere flew silently over the house My husband was standing at the window in the kitchen and looked up and saw a large( about the size of a house) pure white sphere move across the sky. The object was silent, emitted an aura around it, and the center appeared to pulsate. The center also appeared to made more of plasma rather than metal which you would expect to see if it were a man-made aircraft. He said it was traveling extremely fast and was about 10-15 feet above the tree line (60-70 foot pine trees). It was in his line of sight for about 4-5 seconds and then disappeared behind the tree line. He said it looked like a dinner plate standing on end, not the typical disc shape you would think of with ufo's. He also noted that the light was emitting from the object, it didn't have actual lights on it like you would see on an airplane.;39.4097114035088;-76.5919622807018

Unknown substance hits vehical window and disappears without damage.;2015-11-09 15:00:00;1-3 seconds;Unknown substance hits vehical window and disappears without damage. Unknown Object Report November 9, 2015.  About 15:00 Towson, Maryland 21286  About three o'clock, PM, on Monday, November 9, I was driving south on Providence Road in Towson,  Maryland, Baltimore County. About 50 yards south of Hampton Lane, I noted a strange white light out of the corner of my left  eye. I turned my head to better see what the white light was.  As I did, the white light became the size of a basketball.  The white light slammed into the driver's side door window.  This was accompanied by  a  sound similar to hitting a strip of grooved pavement, but only on the driver's side. As I glanced at the white substance (or sphere) that had hit the window, I noted that it also spread leaks of white substance on all sides of it.  It looked like a water balloon does when it hits something solid. I sounded like a beach ball hitting. This took no more than a second or three.  I am not sure.  My heart started to speed up, but I maintained control of the van I slowed down so I could  look into my side view mirror, looking for anything I might had hit.  There was nothing there.  I slowed further so I could see behind me and on the right side of the van, to the rear.  There was nothing. I looked around me for other vehicles on the road, but saw none. It was a dry, sunny day likely in the 70s.;39.4097114035088;-76.5919622807018
