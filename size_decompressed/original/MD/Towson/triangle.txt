Triangular object, no lights or engines, completely silent;2008-04-23 00:30:00;2 min;Triangular object, no lights or engines, completely silent I am a 50 year old male living in the US. I have lived in this same home for eighteen years with my wife. I've seen strange lights before, that have turned out to be planes or helicopters and even a blimp one time, but this object was totally different from anything I have ever seen.  I went out to my back yard about 12:30pm EST. The sky was perfectly clear and I was looking at the stars. I caught something out of the corner of my eye, looking up into the night sky I saw a triangular object in flight towards the north. The first thing I noticed is that it was completely silent and rather high in the sky. I am close to two airports, also two hospitals.  I've watched many planes and helicopters over our area for the past 18 years but, this object seemed much higher in the sky than most planes that fly over.  I saw the object fly approximately from the south to the north for a few seconds then come to a complete stop. The object sat in one spot allowing me to get a good look at it. It was white and triangular in shape with three red spots(not lights) on the belly of it. There did not appear to be any sign of a rear exhaust or any lights on the object.  After sitting in that spot for maybe five seconds the object shot off to the north at a speed I've have never seen any aircraft move and totally disappeared as if it had flown out of the atmosphere and into space.

Light appeared hazy Sitting outside, during the twilight hours (sun had already set) A small sphere shape object appeared, with a triangle shaped light being emitted from the bottom (basically shaped like a halogen light bulb.) The light seemed to glow and appeared hazy even though it was a perfectly clear evening.  The object moved slowly through the sky and did not make any audible noise.  After about 30 seconds, it disappeared behind the tree line, but was still visible through the branches until it faded out of focus. An unforgettable image ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));39.4097114035088;-76.5919622807018
