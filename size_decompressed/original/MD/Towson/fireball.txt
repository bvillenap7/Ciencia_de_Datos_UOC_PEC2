Bright orange sphere quietly flying accross the night sky.;2013-08-09 21:42:00;1 minute;Bright orange sphere quietly flying accross the night sky. I was walking my dogs and saw a bright orange round flying object.  It was moving from East to West.  It flew steady and straight across the sky normally around the same height airplanes fly.  There was no sound and did not leave a smoke trail.   It was bright orange all around and no blinking lights like airplanes have.  It was very hard to focus on it.   If I was to guess the size of it, it was as big a 5 jumbo jets stacked up together, but in round shape.  I wish i had my cell phone camera on me.   There was another witness.

It left no tail streak and within the flickering, amber glow we saw a large, dark object.   Meteors are usually white or green and always leave a tail streak. It had no typical flashing plane lights and made no sound.  I am quite certain it was neither a plane, helicopter, or meteor.;39.4097114035088;-76.5919622807018

It was while sitting at the longest red light in the history of red lights, that I saw the forth.  They looked like fireballs falling.  But it seemed like they were stopping and then would start moving again.  The three on one side and the fourth coming in from the opposite direction.;39.4097114035088;-76.5919622807018
