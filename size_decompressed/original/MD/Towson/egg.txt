Single, chrome, stationary object witnessed near Baltimore, Maryland. Vanished instantly.;2011-09-26 18:15:00;10 seconds;Single, chrome, stationary object witnessed near Baltimore, Maryland. Vanished instantly. As I was driving home, I just happened to look out the driver's side window, and I saw an object which I initially thought was a very bright star.  However, the daylight was still very bright and no other stars were (or would have been able to be) visible.  When I looked again, I saw that it appeared to be chrome or silver in colour. It did not move, and I had the windows up and the radio on, so I was unable to determine if any sound was being emitted. I do not know how far away it was or how large the stationary object was, however, it appeared the size of a pea held at arm's length. As soon as I was fully able to grasp what I was actually looking at, I drove behind two or three trees, and by the time my vantage point was clear, the object was gone.;39.4097114035088;-76.5919622807018
