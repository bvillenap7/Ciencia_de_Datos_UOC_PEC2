I had a number of choices for what to put in the shape of the craft section because this thing seemed to change formation.  At first it appeared as four lights in the sky moving in a pattern, probably a message.  They were making a distinct patterns, first forming the shape of a cross then gathering in the middle then going outward and making more shapes. It appeared to be a chevron, but then it seemed to change shape as it drifted further and further away into the sky.  The lights from the shape got very close and then the stars appeared to move, as if a huge ship was going across the sky.  It was so frustrating, whenever i thought i was getting a glimpse of something cloud coverage would block me.  I think they were blocking me.  The clouds were very strange last night, filled with an orange hue.  Finally at the end of the sighting, the four orbs turned blue in hue and huddled around a star, perhaps they use this star to harness energy and shoot backwards into space.  These lights faded off into the distance but will still discernible when i left the spot i was at.  This doesn't bother me, I will check the sky for them tonight, they still could be very far away, just visible because of time and space.  During this time I saw a fox acting strange, I saw deer traveling across and abandoned parking lot, and many bunnies.  At around 2 am i saw a big orb, oval shaped and bright wall fall from the sky like a shooting star to my left.;39.4097114035088;-76.5919622807018
