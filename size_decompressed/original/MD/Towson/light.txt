I thought it was a satellite as it passed over like a tiny fast moving star.  It got very bright for a second and  then went back to a moving dimmer light/star.  It was not a shooting star.  It was followed by 8-9 of these each 10-13 seconds apart pretty much on the same path.  Last one was a little to the left.  Each one got very bright when it was about 60 to 75 degrees out if looking up is 90 degrees.  Too tiny to be airplanes.  Starlink maybe?;39.4097114035088;-76.5919622807018
