Very bright object spotted at dusk in Towson, MD;2012-03-07 18:10:00;About 30 seconds;Very bright object spotted at dusk in Towson, MD At about 6:10 I entered my room to grab my phone off my desk.  I glanced outside and something caught my eye.  I quickly realized it was a plane but then something crossed it's path. It was extremely bright and flew on a straight course, but faster than the plane.  It looked smaller than the plane and shined a bright white, possibly reflected sunlight off a metallic surface.  It also looked as if it left a small, almost see-through trail that was gone in seconds.  It broke my line of sight when it passed in front of a cloud.  I waited for it to come out the other side, but it never did.  After about five minutes I stopped looking for it.;39.4097114035088;-76.5919622807018
