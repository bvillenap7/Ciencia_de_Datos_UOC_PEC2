2 white oblong objects hanging in sky at high altitude near Towson on a clear afternoon.  ((NUFORC Note:  Aerostats, probably.  PD));2015-10-23 13:45:00;2-3 minutes;2 white oblong objects hanging in sky at high altitude near Towson on a clear afternoon, looked like blimps but never moved On 10/23/15, about 1:45 p.m., clear & sunny day, I took the Charles St. exit off 695. At the top of the off ramp, looking east,  there were 2 white oblong shaped objects in the sky, same height but with some distance between them.  I watched them while I waited for traffic to move, thinking they were blimps but the objects never moved and seemed to be at a higher altitude than blimps fly.  They just hung there for the 2-3 minutes I watched and were still there when I drove away. It made me feel weird but I convinced myself they were just blimps until I saw a similar report on your website from a couple weeks ago that sounds exactly like what I saw.
