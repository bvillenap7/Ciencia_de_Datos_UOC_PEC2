We drove out of the city and off into a farm field where there were no lights around so we could see the stars clearly.  It was difficult at first to actually see the stars because it was a cloudy night and we were only 15 minutes away from the bright lights of the city.  As we searched for Andromeda, we all started commenting on the orange light that hung right above our horizon dew North.  The light appeared to be moving, but after a few minutes we agreed it was still and that it could possibly be a radio tower or fixated light of some sort. We tried to get a closer look with my telescope but all we could make out was a grainy, orange glow. (Definitely in the shape a circle- we were able to see the shape with our telescope set at 25x) I attempted to use my phone to zoom in on the object but it was still blurry so I just gave up.  In our opinion it was not a star because it was so close to our horizon and the brightness of the city wouldn’t have allowed us to see a star that low.  It was lower than any observable star in the sky. The clouds South of us were moving in so quickly that we could literally watch them roll over the horizon covering the stars.  We got distracted by this and turned around for a second, when we turned back around the object was completely gone.  We did see a plane flying through the sky (at about the same altitude) but it was definitely not the same object because it had a red blinking light and it was definitely a plane. After we all realized that the object was gone we got such an eerie sensation that we just had to get out of there.  We decided to drive down the road a little bit to make sure it wasn’t a radio tower with an orange light on it- we drove a mile and realized there was no tower, still feeling afraid we turned around and booked it back to the city.  We want to go back to the farm field at some point this week to make sure there is not a radio tower there. We will keep you updated. Unfortunately- I did not get the picture that I was ABOUT to take. UGH!;39.4097114035088;-76.5919622807018
Multiple flying bright discs flying over Towson.;2015-06-06 22:40:00;~10 minutes;Multiple flying bright discs flying over Towson. Towson, MD, near Towson Town Center June 6, 2015, around 10:40 p.m., I saw multiple moving bright spots in sky.  They were flying from North to South. They were flying in groups, one group after the other.  There were about 4 groups of 5 spots. I thought it's helicopters and looked at them with my binoculars.  They were definitely not helicopters, they were silent bright circles moving with different speeds, slow at first and faster later.;39.4097114035088;-76.5919622807018
