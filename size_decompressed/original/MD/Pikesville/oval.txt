Very loud hovering craft with red green white flashing lights;2015-01-17 03:27:00;5 minutes;Very loud hovering craft with red green white flashing lights 01/17/15  Between 3:15am to 3:27am  Woke up to a loud noise outside of my window.  At first thought it was the television, but when I muted the tv, realized it was outside.  Sounded like an aircraft of some type.   When I looked out the window, saw some type of large aircraft hovering (50 feet?) directly above my apartment townhouse building.  From my vantage point had multiple green and red alternating flashing lights.  The green lights were flashing like a triangle.   Hovered for possibly five minutes, then slowly flew away eastbound.  The shape above appeared to be oblong, but as it flew away, it looked more like a cylinder with white flashing lights.   Took a picture with my cell phone while it was moving away, but appears blurry and somewhat different from what I actually saw.;39.3733;-76.7278999999999
