Blue ball of light flashed across the sky in Northwestern Baltimore County, Maryland.;2002-02-23 21:30:00;seconds;Blue ball of light flashed across the sky in Northwestern Baltimore County, Maryland. I was driving on 795 South, at approximately 9:30 pm.  The stretch of 795 that I was on at the time is very well lit, since I was near the merge with 695 (the Baltimore Beltway).  In a North to South direction in the sky, there was a ball of light that was greenish blue in color, almost turquoise.  It flashed across the sky in the matter of a second.  There was no trail behind it.   I had seen something similar on 2/13/02, which I also reported on this site.  This time, my daughter (who is 13) saw it too. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor.
