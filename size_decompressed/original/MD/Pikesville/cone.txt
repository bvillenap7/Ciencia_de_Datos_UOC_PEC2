I was on my balcony as I am every night.  I happened to look up and see an orange ball of light.I watched it for about 15 seconds and I noticed it was moving very fast across the sky.   About 5-15 seconds later, the object just stopped.  As it moved, it went from orange to yellow to bright red.  It didn't slow don't it just stopped for about 5 sec. count... one one thousand 2 one thousand.  This is what all times are based off of.   Then it took off again and about 3-5 sec later it stopped for about 5 sec and did this about 4-5 time until it disappeared.  Off to the right.  No explosion or did it ever descend, it just disappeared.   Also I saw no blinking lights like an aircraft!   Look, if you are really reading this, I swear this is what I saw.  Very confusing to me!  Believe what you want but this was real.  Do I believe the are aliens from other world.  Yes, I would have to be an idiot not to believe.  Do I really believe in what I saw YES!  I will take a lie detector to! prove it!;39.3733;-76.7278999999999
