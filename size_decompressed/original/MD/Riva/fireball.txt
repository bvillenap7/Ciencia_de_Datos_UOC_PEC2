While at soccer practice in Riva, MD, approx. 630pm, my son and three of his friends saw 1 Orange light rise up in the sky, fairly slowly.   He mentioned whitish sparks coming from the back of it and a smaller Orange ball coming from the larger first ball.   I did not see the object, although more than 3 individuals described it exactly as my son did, corroborating his sighting.  The Orange ball rose than moved behind a cloud and was not seen after that.   My son also mentioned a horn being tripped as the object disappeared.;38.9547;-76.5786
