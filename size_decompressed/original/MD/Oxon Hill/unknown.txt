Didnt anyone else see the slow moving black object gliding over the DMV?????;2013-11-15 16:00:00;15 minutes;Didnt anyone else see the slow moving black object gliding over the DMV????? I debated for a few days on whether or not to report this and have been watching daily to see if anyone else would.  On the evening of Friday 15th I 'd arrived at work and did what I usually do which is look up at the sky.  What I saw could best be described as an electric guitar, black, huge and just below the cloudline, and it was very cloudy this day because of approaching storms.  This is my second sighting within a year, that ive seen something strange and unexplainable gliding through the sky, and I am telling you these things are SILENT!  It flew over my head therefore I could see it was one solid object, at some point it appeared to hover in the distance once glided past me, I would say it could have been as much as two miles out and it still was visable as a little dot, so it had to be pretty huge, however it was very high.  There were two other witnesses to this, (coworkers), one of which is ex military and whom admits to having  witnessed a few of them in his lifetime, thought it might be balloons until I showed them the pic I took and a explained that it had flown above my head. The pic was taken from my LG Optimus 13 pix, and is very fuzzy. I am currently looking into having it analyzed for the publics proof, I don't need it, I know what I saw, and am hoping others will come forth with a report to.
