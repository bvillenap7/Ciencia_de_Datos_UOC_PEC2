I noticed something drop down out of the sky above our heads and stop for about 2 seconds then started to fly south.  When I alerted my friend to look it stopped again and shot off the the left of us really fast in a zig zag pattern over the Potomac River and into the clouds.  It was shaped like a triangle and look brownish in color.  After we seen a helicopter fly low in a circle motion above us and above the water.  Then in a far distance a white light started to flash.
