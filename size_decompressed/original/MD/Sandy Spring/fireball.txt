My mother bean and I saw a fireball shooting out of the sky. At first, it seemed like a comet or meteor, but we now know it was not for both of those would last a lot longer than what we saw.  It was only seen for 3 minutes because it came down at an incredible speed. I tried to take a few pictures but it was almost as if what I saw with my eyes did not appear on camera.
