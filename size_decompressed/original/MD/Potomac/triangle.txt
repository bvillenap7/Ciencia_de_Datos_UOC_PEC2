I and girlfriend noticed a bright object in the sky around 10:45.;2012-12-14 22:45:00;40 minutes;I was driving with my girlfriend and i noticed a bright object in the sky around 10:45. As i mentioned it to her i realized that the lights were not blinking.  There were three bright white lights on the bottom of the object.  The bottom was shaped like a triangle.  The object was very low and flying slow. We were following it, and it stopped over a golf coarse and hovered for a few seconds.  This gave me a good side view. It seemed that it curved up from opposite sides on top.  There was also a red light on top near the back.  Soon the object moved and it was headed towards the Potomac River.  We got onto a road that moved parallel with the object, it stayed low over the river but then it came back our way and also got higher.  I drove the opposite direction and it stayed behind the whole time. I pulled over and got a picture and video, but all you see is the lights, no detail of the object.  Then I had to drive my girlfriend home, which was about 15 minutes north o! f our location.  On our way we passed an open area with no trees and saw the object high up and moving north faster than before.  It was noticeably bright, easily the brightest thing in the sky.  As we got to her house I saw the object pass by very fast and it was going north.  As it went by i realized how massive it was.  It looked almost like a cigarette at the speed it was moving.;39.0397;-77.1917999999999
