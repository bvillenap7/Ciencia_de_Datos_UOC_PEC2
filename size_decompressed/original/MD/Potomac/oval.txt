Bright orb high in morning sky seen moving in and out of clouds.;2015-08-26 07:35:00;3-5 minutes;Bright orb high in morning sky seen moving in and out of clouds. I saw what appeared to be an orb shaped object that was quite high in the sky.  It appeared to be smaller than any aircraft that would be flying that high.  It was also very bright the sun was not reflecting off of it like it would an aircraft.   The orb moved steadily and slowly across the sky in between clouds.  As it approached a cloud...and proceeded to enter the cloud, it did not come through on the other side.   I turned away after a couple minutes and waited before looking up again.  I then saw the orb do the same thing a second time.  I cannot explain this. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to provide no contact information.  PD));39.0397;-77.1917999999999
