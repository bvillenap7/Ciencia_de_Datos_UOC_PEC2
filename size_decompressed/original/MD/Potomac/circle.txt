Large orange ball traveled fast in night sky and then disappeared;1988-06-01 21:00:00;3 secs;Large orange ball traveled fast in night sky and then disappeared I am writing to report an old sighting because I am still curious as to what it might be.  It did not appear to be an alien craft but I would guess a strange natural phenomenon or light play.  I’m sorry I don’t even remember how long ago or the time of year it was.  Maybe 20 years ago, a friend and I were standing in her driveway at night (definitely dark).  We both saw an orange ball travel fast from east to west for just a few seconds and then disappear in the middle of the sky.  It was fairly low in the sky and was traveling just above the school building we could see about 1/4 of a mile away.  It had the strength of color and glow of the setting sun.  It appeared large although we had no reference point as to its size.  At the time I had no idea who to call to ask what it may have been.  We were in Potomac, Maryland about 20 miles northwest of Washington, DC. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));39.0397;-77.1917999999999
