STEADY RED LIGHT GOING EAST TO WEST;2001-10-26 05:00:00;ONE MINUTE;STEADY RED LIGHT GOING EAST TO WEST STEADY RED LIGHT THE SIZE OF THE NORTH STAR, MOVING EAST TO WEST, VERY FAST, VERY HIGH.  I HEARD AIRCRAFT ENGINES, BUT COULD NOT BE SURE IF THERE WAS ALSO AN AIRPLANE IN THE VISINITY. THE SOUND WAS SIMILAR TO THE F-14.  IS THERE SOME KIND OF MILITARY AIRCRAFT THAT ONLY HAS RED LIGHTS AND DO NOT BLINK? ((NUFORC Note:  All ships and aircraft are required to have a red light on the left (port) side, and a green light on the right (starboard) side during nighttime operations.  This allows other craft to be able to identify which direction another craft is heading so a collision can be avoided.  We suspect, given that the witness heard engine noise, that she witnessed a fast-moving aircraft, perhaps a military fighter.  PD));39.0397;-77.1917999999999
Bright yellow light followed (intercepted) by red pulsating light;2012-05-18 00:00:00;20 minutes;Bright yellow light followed (intercepted) by red pulsating light I was running on a high school track in Montgomery County, Maryland at around 11:30PM on 5/18/2012.  I noticed a bright yellow light off in the distance, flying from the east to the north and then west in a circular path. Soon after I noticed the first light, a second, slightly dimmer, pulsating red light appeared from way above to the top and right, and descended on like an intercept path (45 degree angle), behind the yellow light.  It was flying far behind the yellow one and slight got closer and closer until it looked like it was literally 1 inch behind the other.  Then it kept following the other yellow one until they were both out of my vision through the trees. By this time, though 15 minutes must've passed since I first saw them and I literally had to turn around 360 degrees on the track to keep sight of the path.  It went from my right all the way around... it was really bizarre cause I never saw anything like that.;39.0397;-77.1917999999999

I saw a reddish pink light across the sky with dark clouds floating and it was not a sun.  This pink light disappeared in less than five minutes.  There was one witness who took the photo of the light.;39.0397;-77.1917999999999
