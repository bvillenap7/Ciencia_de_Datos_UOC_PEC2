Loud noise, bright lights and a new part of me was opened!;2003-02-16 18:00:00;ufo;Loud noise, bright lights and a new part of me was opened! I was outside looking at all of the snow on the ground with my dog when I had taken a snowflake in the eye. I had gotten mad at the snow so I had looked up. with all of the clouds in the sky i knew that I wasn't going to see much. I wanted to look up at the stars so i just stared off and when I rellized there was a weird flashing light up in the sky. So I had thought that well it was problably a plane but it wasn't moving! I had gotten a little freaked out but i just kept looking up! I stared closer, closer and then a new set of lights appered through the clouds. then another after another came down through the clouds. Each one had eight diffrent sets of flashing lights. Then my dog started to bark and the lights had all light up as if they heard her. The lights got brighter and brighter and I heard a loud shreeking noise and yet dipite the pain I keept looking up. My dog got scared and ran with her tail tuked. Then out of no where a beam of light flashed on my face and then my body and I fell as if someone oushed me! Then with a flash of light they dissiperd. all except for one wich lingerd there for a moment flashing its lights as if it was trying to communicate with me. when it was doing this i didn't feel scared but rather safe in an un-homely way. Then just like the others it went away in a flash! I still remained still and then wen't inside and started to feel things i've never felt befor like a new part of me had just ben awaken. And then I found myself going to this site as if i've always known where it was. Now i am writting this! ((NUFORC Note:  Report submitted by a young student.
