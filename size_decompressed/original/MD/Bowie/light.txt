I obseved the light, stationary in the sky with binoculars,  for approximately one hour, before the cloud cover concealed it.  Three nights later I observed the same object in another part of the sky.  I summons three of my neighbors, who saw the light also.  We observed the light through binoculars for approximately 45 min before in moved below the tree line.  The entire time the light continued to change from red to green to yellow.  Through the binoculars it almost appeared the red light was rotating around in a circle. I first saw this light on 032699 at 2330 hours.  The thing that caught my attention is the red light that was ommiting from itt.  I got my binoculars and through them I could see the light was changing from red to green to yellow.  It also appeared the red light may have been rotating around in a circlet.  My wife and I watched the light for approximately one hour, before the cloud cover concealed it.  The light appeared to be stationary and was as bright at the stars in the sky.  Three days later on 032999 at 2300 hours I again saw the light in a different part of the sky.  Through the binoculars I could still see the light changing from red to green to yellow.  This time I summons three of my neighbors who also observed the light and the changing colors.  It also appeared this time that the light was moving.  We watched it for approximately 45  min before it dissappeared below the tree line.  We are not pranksters.  We are reporting this because we would like to know if any one else in the area has reported this thing.  We would also like to know what it is.  Two of us are police officers and  another one of us is in the  U.S. Air Force.  My dad was in the Air force for twenty five years and I lived on Air  Force Bases for much of that time.  I know what an air plane looks like and this was not a plane or a star.  None of the other hundred stars in the sky on these two nights was doing what this particular light was doing.  Tonight I'm going to try and get pictures if i can.;38.9581876470588;-76.7570605882352
Bluish white light UFO flying low at high speed above Baltimore Washington Pky, Dec 23, 2007;2007-12-23 18:45:00;5 seconds;Bluish white light UFO flying low at high speed above Baltimore Washington Pky, Dec 23, 2007 On December 23, 2007 at approximately 6:45pm I was driving with my 21 year old daughter, south on the Baltimore Washington Parkway around Bowie, MD. (just before the NASA exit)   The strip of bluish white light caught my attention as it was directly in front of me flying low.  I watched this object for about 5 seconds and then it disappeared.   I thought it must have vanished behind a cloud, however there were only thinly scattered clouds at that time.   My daughter looked at me, after it vanished, and asked, Did you see that?   We discussed what it could be, but knew it wasn't a shooting star or any aircraft we have ever seen.   I am in the aviation business and have attended airshows in Paris and Dubai and have never seen anything fly like this.   This object was about the length of two full moons and its movement was smooth, direct and fast.  It flew in an angle downward from the right to the left and it flew low.  It came suddenly and disappeared suddenly.;38.9581876470588;-76.7570605882352

Shiny object moving towards clouds.;2014-09-02 12:00:00;1 minute;Shiny Object moving towards clouds I was driving to work on route 214.  There were big clouds in the sky ahead of me, and there was something whitish and shiny moving toward them.  I say shiny because the sun was reflecting off of it.   When it got in front of the cloud I could not longers see it.  I'm almost certain it disappeared.;38.9581876470588;-76.7570605882352
Very bright light in the sky over Annapolis;2017-05-18 15:15:00;25-30 seconds;Very bright light in the sky over Annapolis The sky was clear and blue. at 3:15PM I was driving east on Route 50 from D.C. towards Bowie, and a very bright (stronger in intensity than, say, Venus) light suddenly appeared in the distant sky straight ahead at a 45-degrees position over the horizon, for approximately twenty five to thirty seconds.   Since Route 50 was congested I could only glance at it about five or six times during the 25-second period.  Each glance lasted about two to five seconds.  Then it was gone--just vanished.   I continued to watch where it had been until I got to Route 301 to turn off and there was no plane or dark object that would indicate an aerial vehicle producing it.   When I got home I checked the map and it appeared to have been high over Annapolis or Edgewater, Maryland, a distance of 17 miles from where I saw it.  But that's a guess--it could have been farther away.;38.9581876470588;-76.7570605882352
