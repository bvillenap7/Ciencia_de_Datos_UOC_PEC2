Bright light floating around;2021-09-04 03:15:00;2.5 hours;Bright light floating around Saturday September 4th, 2021 Awoke to dog barking (as usual) at around 0315. Looked out my door window after going downstairs. Door faces directly south. Noticed unusually bright light in distance just above tree line. This is within urban city neighborhood. Object was very far off, almost appeared to be a planet or other star, but noticed Object floating around, moving slightly in a non rhythmic or patterned way. Wife observed Object after I made the risky decision to wake her. I continued to observe the Object for almost 2 hours until it slightly descended and gradually faded away toward the south.  Object appeared to be triangular in shape. During the observation multiple photos and videos were taken from a samsung galaxy phone. Position and movement of object over time clearly shows it was not following a trajectory or orbit. Object would fade and brighten multiple times.  Weather was clear skies with little to no cloud coverage. Other stars and planets in sky were clearly visible. Using the Skyview app, the object appeared at first to be Bunda, a star in the Aquarius constellation. However, the movement and brightness of the object did not align with that theory.;38.9581876470588;-76.7570605882352
