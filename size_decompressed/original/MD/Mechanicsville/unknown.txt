Base sent jet out on search Around 7pm tonight, I heard what I thought was a plane flying close to the house.  The noise got closer and louder sounding almost like a big truck and the house started shaking. Very quickly after that I heard a high pitch sound and could hear the object soar over the house very fast.   While I was hearing this my husband was in the bedroom and looked out the window.  He came out to me and asked, What the hell was that?  He described what he saw as an object with very bright lights flying very low slowly heading south in the neighborhood and stop over where our house is and turn west and take off very fast over top our house and our neighborhood.  We went out back and could see nothing anymore but heard a jet start up on pax naval base.  Within a few seconds we saw the jet start circling around the area.  That lasted at least 15-20 minutes.   The base saw something pop up on radar that the was not supposed to be there.  Very weird.;38.4292;-76.7245
