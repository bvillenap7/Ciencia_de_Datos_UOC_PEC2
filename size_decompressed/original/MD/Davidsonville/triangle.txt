It is a very clear Night no cloud cover.  We noticed a large craft flying low that changed directions and tilted to fly towards where we were standing in front of the yard on the other side of the Road.  We questioned why it was so bright and low.  We also heard nothing that sounded like jets or planes.  As the craft reached towards the road we noticed 3 distinct white lights on each corner and a flashing red light on top of the craft and the craft was approx. 5000 ft up which is not normal for planes that large to fly in this residential/rural area.  It then flew over us silently tilted once again to make a faint turn and realized it was an isosceles triangle.  It slowly flew past and above us down Governors Bridge Rd towards route 50. It was so clear and unbelievable that we witnessed this craft.   I ran inside quickly to get my phone to take pictures b! ut it had flew off and didn't return.;38.9372;-76.6356
