Saucer shaped disc hovering silently over the treetops, rural Anne Arundel County, MD. October 1976;1976-10-20 20:00:00;10 minutes;Saucer shaped disc hovering silently over the treetops, rural Anne Arundel County, MD. October 1976 It was a clear mid October night, approximately 8:00 pm.  I was 18 years old, my cousin and I were on our way to Annapolis, MD.  It was on riva road, mostly rural, 8 to 10 miles south of Annapolis.   We came over a small hill on a short straightaway before a larger hill.  On the straight we both saw this object to my left, it was hovering very low maybe 200 ft.  Above the treetops. It was so surprising, I pulled over right away.  We stayed in the car,because honestly, there was some fear, but not enough to leave.   As we sat there two other vehicles also stopped to look, though we didn't speak to them.  It was very large, stereotypical of the flying saucers from the movies.  It was perhaps 80 to 100 yards across.  It was a metal gray color,with a dome or bubble in the center.  It sat there hovering silently, then suddenly tilted one side down towards the trees.  It very slowly moved down, still tilted at an angle, as it did white lights started going on and off in sequence.  They weren't overly bright, but looked to go on and off completely around.  As it neared the treetop it leveled off.  Then quicker than I could blink the object was on the other side of the road.  It stayed there a few seconds then it was gone.  It left so fast it seemed to disappear.  All the while,it stayed completely silent. I drove towards Annapolis with us scanning the sky but it was gone.  The next day I was expecting the local paper to have it on the front page, but nothing.  I worked at a local country store, and the owner was in the Maryland house of delegates.  I told anyone that would listen, but I don't believe anyone took it seriously. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));38.9372;-76.6356
