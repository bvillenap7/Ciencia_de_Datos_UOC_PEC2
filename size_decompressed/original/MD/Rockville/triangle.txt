BUT THE FIRST SIGHTING WA;1999-09-30 20:29:00;10 seconds;I RETURNED TO THIS SUMMARY BECAUSE SOMETHING DIFFERENT JUST NOW HAPPENED AS I WROTE THE COMPLETE DESCRIPTION. BUT THE FIRST SIGHTING WAS AN Equilateral triangle.red light in center,white lights on the corners.Altitude Approx. 5000ft. stationary to a tilt.Seen from auto on Randolph and Nicholson slightly to the south 70degrees. My wife and I saw the flying triangle of lights from the car. We live near the landing pattern for Andrews Air Force base and I have noticed within the past year that the nav light configuration has changed for many aircraft and now take on a triangle shapes vastly different from the wingtip and tail configuration. What was different about this triangle in the sky was the red light that was equidistant and in the center of the white lights. This weekend there has been ...JUST NOW AN INEXPLICABLE DISPLAY OF RT.RED AND WHITE LFT WING LIGHTS IN LINE  WITH A SUPER BRILLIANT RED STROBE (TWICE THE DISTANCE AS BETWEEN THE WING LIGHTS) BELOW AND 30 DEGRESS LEFT OF THE APPARANT WING LIGHTS. There was an abnormally loud single engine noise which made me look off the porch by my computer. Anyway this weekend has been replete with low screaming fighter jets 3 in formation that I saw and lots of helicopter traffic. The red strobe I just witnessed as I was writing this was really bright about 10-20 million candle power in red.  And why would it be in perfect 90 mph formation below and to the left as if attached in some way. It reminds me of Pheonix when a later event by the National Guard became the cover story.;39.070892857143;-77.1396328571428
Triangular object silhouetted against moon - digital photograph;2001-06-27 20:50:00;30 seconds;Triangular object silhouetted against moon - digital photograph Photographing moon with Fuji S1 Pro digital camera and 1000mm f/11 Mead mirror lens. Took a series of perhaps ten photographs - two show the anomalous shape. I heard no sound, in fact I didn't even see the object until I downloaded the images to my computer. The object has moved to the far edge of the moon in the second image, which was taken approximately 30 seconds after this one. ((NUFORC Note:  We presume the witness means June 27th, 2001, and we have changed the date here.  PD));39.070892857143;-77.1396328571428
Bright triangular shaped object moves at a rediculous speed across my window;2008-01-15 01:50:00;2 seconds;Bright triangular shaped object moves at a rediculous speed across my window I was sitting at home watching TV early in the morning.  As I was watching TV out of the corner of my window this big bright light caught my eye.  This light was moving very fast across my window.  It had three big bright lights in a triangle shape.  Two at the bottom facing the ground and one facing the sky.  I have watched planes go across this window every night.  This object was flying the opposite way of these airplanes and a very high speed.  From my view the object looked like it was a couple hundred feet off the ground and moving downward.  I have never seen such a bright object cross that window before.;39.070892857143;-77.1396328571428
6 orange colored triangular shaped craft moving at extream high speed and ultra high altitude;2009-12-11 22:41:00;5-7 seconds;6 orange colored triangular shaped craft moving at extream high speed and ultra high altitude At 10:41 on Friday the 11th December, I witnessed 6 UFOs in a triangular shape flying south easterly in direction, very high in the sky, (Satellite high) if I was to try and guess the height I would say these or this body was in near orbit to earth, the light being emitted by the triangular shape or they may have even been 6 individual craft flying in formation were moving at my best guess 3 times the speed of a satellite passing over head, the light from the craft/crafts was very dim constant orange color, difficult to focus my eyes in the night sky as I had just taken the dog out for a quick late evening walk, there was no sound that I could detect being omitted by this sighting, there were also several commercial aircraft at high altitude flying in different directions unconnected to this (Near to Airport) This sighting has shaken me for I have never ever witnessed anything like this before, the speed of the craft or crafts was fast, much slower than say ! a shooting star or meteor but way faster than satellite track.;39.070892857143;-77.1396328571428
Green triangle, and flashing lights.;2013-05-01 00:00:00;3-5 minutes;Green triangle, and flashing lights. In May of 2013 I was in Rockville, Maryland, when I looked into the clear night sky and saw a bright green arrow shaped object whiz across the sky while it was happening I tried to tell my friends to look up but I was speechless..   Then after about 5 minutes I they looked into the stars with me and one of them though they saw a shooting star, so we kept looking and it was extremely unusual, it was a very bright flashing object going around the area at amazing speeds, then all the sudden it stopped, and it was gone.  It last for about 3 minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.   PD));39.070892857143;-77.1396328571428
