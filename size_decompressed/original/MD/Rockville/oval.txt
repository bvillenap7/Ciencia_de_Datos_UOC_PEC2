I saw 3-4 huge oval cloudy shapes darting zig zag fashion at split second speed about airplane level.;2016-12-03 18:00:00;10 minutes;At approximately 6-6:15 PM I exited  MD355 North onto the I-270 North towards Rockville. As soon as I was on 270, I saw 3-4 huge oval cloudy shapes darting zig zag fashion at split second speed, about airplane level.   There was no light coming from the earth, light a search light. Compared to the airplane that flew by,these shapes seemed 10 times as large.  I stayed in the right exit lane until exit 5, then had to leave 270 north.  However I was able to maintain these darting huge cloudy objects for about 10 minutes.;39.070892857143;-77.1396328571428
