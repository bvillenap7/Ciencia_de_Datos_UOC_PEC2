blue falling object, followed by 2 white lights and aircrafts searching Rockville,MD;2012-10-05 22:30:00;20-30 minutes;blue falling object, followed by 2 white lights and aircrafts searching Rockville,MD On the night of October 5, 2012, at around 2230-2300, in the rockville, Md. area, i unsure which road it was on, since i am not local to the area.  I was told it was place where high income people shopped.  I was driving on a 4 lane road, with two lanes on either side and grassy area in the middle with trees on either side of the road.  i know i was near a large shopping/metropolitan area.  i was the driver of the car.  It was a clear warm night, with no cloud cover. it was dark clear sky when the first 2 different UFO’s where seen, there was almost no street lights to inter fear with my sight. While driving coming from the right hand top corner of my vision coming from i saw a blue round fire ball like object that appeared to be fall from the sky, moving out from the right upper corner to left lower corner of my vision, this lasted in my sight for about 6-8 seconds.  its size was about 2-3 inches around from where i was. It had a clearly defined edges and appeared out have an outer shell of some short, which dark blue or black areas the outside.  This dark outer layer did not fully coat the object but move around it. The inside was what i could only describe as blue lighting inside, it appeared to be rotating or moving very rapidly inside. there where different shades of darker blue closer to the “shell” and lighter blue into the center.  This thing fell very quickly and i heard no noise or any other lights. there appeared to be no tail or trail in the sky behind it. Within 1-2 minutes after seeing this thing fall from the sky,  two white solid lights appeared in the sky one about a hands length above the other, the higher one trailed behind the lower one, about what appeared to be a hand length away. While moving to the across the sky from left to right side of view i was positioned behind these objects, for they where moving away from me, there was no other lights around these things, they where solid white balls of light these 2 objects, no wing lights or nothing things else around them. they then where gone from my sight and never reappeared. 5 minutes later, i arrived in the shopping/metropolitan area, while still continuing to look up to the sky,  there was about 6-8 small air crafts in the air flying around the general area. these where definitely planes for they had the correct wing lights in place. they appeared to be flying in pairs. i was able to stop at a traffic light and clearly see these planes searching for something. they where gone from the area after about 12-18 minutes.  I have never seen anything in my life like this, besides the normal air crafts.;39.070892857143;-77.1396328571428
Two small white/metallic objects about 30 to 40 degrees below and equidistant to the sun;2016-01-30 14:30:00;Seconds;On Saturday, January 30th, 2016, at 2:30pm, in Rockville, Maryland, I was standing on the subway platform (Metro's Red Line) waiting for the subway going into the direction of Washington D.C.  The weather was a  clear day, with barely any clouds, and bright blue skies overhead. I was facing in the direction of the sun, when I noticed two small white/metallic objects about 30 to 40 degrees below and equidistant to the sun (This is my best estimates).  The objects were oval shaped maybe 1/10 to 1/20 the size of sun in comparison. At first, I thought these were two small clouds, but I noticed that these were unusual looking since they had a shiny metallic and reflective texture for clouds.  I turned to my friend to see if they saw it as well.  They confirmed the two objects, and found them to be very strange in appearance.  By the time I turned around to lend them my sun glasses to get a better view, the two objects had disappeared. This whole incident occurred in a matter of seconds. I am open to the idea that this could have been an atmospheric phenomena if someone could explain this, but for now, I feel these were two objects which were unidentifiable.;39.070892857143;-77.1396328571428
a formation of four or five lights in a single line parallel to the ground forming one apparent craft;2021-04-04 00:15:00;5 minutes;a formation of four or five lights in a single line parallel to the ground forming one apparent craft -I filmed entire event via a night vision / infrared monocular  -object not visible to naked eye, only the monocular  -i am a lawyer in DC and MD and i practice law. However i have an interest in the ufo genre and occasionally film sky from my bed through the window  -my viewing window looks approximately east/south east  -i know what planes, stars, planets, and helicopters look light at night  -the object was four to five lights arranged parallel to ground (i.e. a line of lights parallel to ground) appearing as one craft. The light formation was at a slight tilt to the left and hovering, it seemed  -occasionally, little flashing orbs would appear in my viewfinder around the possible craft/light formation. I had been witnessing many of these bright flashing orbs for about 45 mins before the light formation appeared. I filmed the flashing light orbs as well. Orbs also not visible to naked eye but only through the camera/monocular  -all lights seemed to appear as the color similar to a halogen lamp like, say, the headlights of a contemporary BMW  -The potential craft/light formation seemed to flash in two or three areas along the craft, not seeming to move at all, but rather, hovering  -I zoomed in a few times (36x) and saw more clearly that this was indeed a formation of four or five lights, a possible single craft  -I lost track of the light formation after a few minutes but the light orbs continued flashing   -the video is shaky bc no image stabilizer  -I tried to get the ground and/or stars in the pic for perspective  -i cannot gauge how far out the object was nor its size. Same with the flashing orbs. I believe it/they was/were at least a few thousand feet in air and about 2 to 3 miles away from me. The flashing orbs were all over the east/southeast view at various times throughout the recording  -I have been seeing the flashing orbs for the past couple months and gave a number of recorded films of said objects. For example on july 4, 2021 i filmed a series of flashing orbs close to/nearby a fireworks display  -happy to share videos  -please do not reveal my identity  -please use email for contact.;39.070892857143;-77.1396328571428
