White fluorescent light color/dark circle in center/spherical shape/glimpse of it leaving orbit vanished leaving 2 lights behind it;2013-09-22 23:25:00;3 seconds;white fluorescent light color/dark circle in center/spherical shape/glimpse of it leaving orbit vanished leaving 2 lights behind it I was taking my pet out for a nighttime walk when I looked up at the sky for a moment. About a good 5-10 seconds I was looking up at the sky, I saw a flying object with white fluorescent coloring flying upward toward the sky. It was difficult to make out the shape of it due to a poor perspective. I caught it (from my angle) coming out from behind a house (though i'm sure it was much further away) and I have a hunch I caught a glimpse of it JUST as it was leaving the planet. I saw it for maybe just about one second traveling at a miraculous speed (for an object so far away) before it disappeared. After it disappeared it left two lines of light behind it that vanished after about 2 seconds. All I could make out was that from my angle it looked like a round ring shaped craft with a black dark spot in the center of it, so I guess you'd define that as a spherical or circle-like object. Also, there was no sound being emitted from this object. At first I thought it! was just the moon, but then I looked around and realized that from the direction I was standing, the moon was 90 degrees to my left. So NO it wasn't the moon.;39.070892857143;-77.1396328571428
Grey, circular object with no lights or sound gliding swiftly across the sky.  ((anonymous report));2017-04-17 22:18:00;15 seconds;Grey, circular object with no lights or sound gliding swiftly across the sky. Using astronomy app to map stars, when I noticed a grey circular shape gliding across the sky without any sounds or lights.  I had binoculars with me and got a quick glimpse of the object- it definitely was not a meteor or a plane because I see many of them pass over all the time.  The way the object was moving was oddly swift and smooth in a straight horizontal line headed toward VA.  It would have been very hard to pick up on as it did not leave a trace.
