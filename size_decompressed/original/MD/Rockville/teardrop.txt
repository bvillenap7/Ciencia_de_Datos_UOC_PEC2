There was NO sound.  My friend I simply watched it fly over us and out of view. it was a steady movement and left our sigh shortly after entering it.  As far as we know nothing happened. we just watched it fly over.  From where were the span of the object in the sky was 2-5 meteres across, suggesting it was very very large if we had been up close.  At the time we were both afraid I dismissed it as a government experiment and we slept. (down below it says contacted by an investigator, there isnt much else than this, other than a picture in my sketch book.);39.070892857143;-77.1396328571428
