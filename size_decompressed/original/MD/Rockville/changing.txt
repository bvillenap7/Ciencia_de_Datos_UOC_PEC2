Object that acted like a rust colored balloon turned flat and sped away.;2003-12-12 13:00:00;30sec;Object that acted like a rust colored balloon turned flat and sped away. I was looking out of a parked car window at a helicopter that looked like it was dragging a rust colored balloon behind it. The helicopter flew off and the 'balloon' floated free for awhile (15-20sec. A thought entered my mind oh, someone lost their balloon. Then it's flight leveled off and it pivoted (changed)into a flat silver object that sped off flying low at tree level. The car windows were closed as it was cold, this was an urban area, and there was very little wind.;39.070892857143;-77.1396328571428
strange dark shape changing object with an aura;2005-09-13 16:15:00;~5 min;strange dark shape changing object with an aura Single dark object appearing to continuously change shape, such that it looked to be almost tumbling slowly and in a straight direction of travel. A random glint of light could occasionally be seen as well, like an intermittent reflection of sunlight which added to the tumbling appearance. With clear blue skies the object itself was clearly visible but impossible to say at what height. Adding to the strange appearance was a ring of distortion around the object in an area several times larger than the object itself. This distorted area looked similar to the effect of heat radiating in the distance off a hot road, except that it had a distinct swirling pattern seemingly generated by the object.;39.070892857143;-77.1396328571428
