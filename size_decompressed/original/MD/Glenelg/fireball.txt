Fireball floating slowly low then vanishing.;2014-02-27 20:00:00;1 minute;fireball floating slowly low then vanishing. While driving on I-70 noticed a fireball low as some of the airplanes fly in their routes to BWI airport.  Looked like the residue of a firework floating toward the ground but much larger.about 1/4 the size of a 747 aircraft.  Floating towards the ground and then suddenly vanished.  Was as low as some airplanes fly along interstate.  Planes fly low enough in this area that you can read what airline it is on the plane.  That's how close it was to the ground but maybe a 1/2 mile in front of me. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));39.2585;-77.0202
