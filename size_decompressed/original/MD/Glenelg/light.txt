silent light seen floating in sky in July of 1990;1990-07-15 23:30:00;2 minutes;silent light seen floating in sky in July of 1990 On the evening above I came home from work and parked my car in front of my house. Looking up in the sky I saw a small light that was moving in an unclear pattern but stayed in the general vacinity. It seemed to be close by the way it moved but I could not hear the craft. I had, at the time, a million candle power spot light in my car. I pointed it to the sky in the direction of the object. It did not seem to change direction or activity. It actually scared me and I went inside. I came outside a half hour later to see nothing. No idea what I saw. I thought it could have been an ultralight aircraft, but it made no noise.
