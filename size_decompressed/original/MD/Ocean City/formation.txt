This entire incident lasted only about 10 seconds.  It was about 9:30 pm and I was looking out toward the ocean from the balcony of the 10th floor ocean front room at the Hilton.  The sky was clear and the stars shined brightly.  2 ships were on the horizon and not moving.   Seemingly out of nowhere, a straight line of 5 evenly spaced amber colored lights appeared in the sky directly in front of me.  They were in the sky well above the ocean's horizon, and half way between me and the 2 ships on the horizon.  My immediate thought was that a very large bomber type air plane was heading right for us.  I called for my wife to come quickly to watch.  More lights appeared (as many as 8 total) and then the straight line started to move in a perfectly sycronized worm or wave frequency pattern.  After 2 full waves the lights simply faded out.  My wife arrived in time to see nothing at all.  It was already over.;38.3378;-75.0873

It was definitely moving pretty fast, disappeared as it continued flying (lights got more dim than they already were), no noises after the fact, no blinking lights;38.3378;-75.0873
