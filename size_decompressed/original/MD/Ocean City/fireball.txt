About 30 minutes north of Ocean City on a beach, my girlfriend and I were sitting on a lifeguard stand looking at the stars.  Far up on our right I saw a star that was moving.  Then it stopped and held its position.   Then it moved again but in a different direction.  Then it stopped.   Then it repeated this pattern several more times.   With an understanding of geometry, I figured the the object must have been more than 10 miles above the earth.   At the rate it was moving, it must have been traveling at many thousand miles per hour to move from one point to the other....How it was able to pause its movement and just hover and then suddenly burst to another position is beyond me.   I am a man of science but when I saw this object, it was a surreal experience.  I couldn't believe what I was seeing and it truly frightened me.  It definitely was not a plane.  There is no man made object I know of that could have moved the way this object did.  This was an impossible event that I witnessed but it was very real.  Everything I'm telling you is the truth and factual. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD));38.3378;-75.0873
Object of green, active cold fire traveling at very high speed low above the ground in absolute silence.;2004-08-15 05:30:00;30 seconds;Object of green, active cold fire traveling at very high speed low above the ground in absolute silence. It was a green sphere of cold fire with brighter light in the middle and greener on outside proportionally.  We were on the beach in very early morning sitting on life guard chair with clouds after the rain.  I've noticed some kind of light in the skies coming from the ocean behind the clouds, as it came closer it appeared under the clouds at the height of about 1 km.   Size of it must of been enormous (if u took a quarter and distanced it from yourself between your fingers-that would approximately describe the size) it moved at the speed of about 5000-10000 km/h with absolute silence over our heads.  It took about 15 seconds to cover the distance from horizon to zenith.  Right after it disappeared in clouds on the side of the continent it started to dawn, as if it was traveling in the last wave of darkness.  We were astonished because it wasn't any type of aircraft known to this day.  Fire was active, but appeared to be cold, as if you looked at the sparklers throu! gh heavy green mist, but there was no mist and object appeared to be between and under the clouds.;38.3378;-75.0873
Flashing lights of all sort hovered above Ocean City, Maryland on August, 30, 2012.;2012-08-30 22:15:00;2 hours;Flashing lights of all sort hovered above Ocean City, Maryland on August, 30, 2012. I was watching a movie when a bunch of flashing green lights caught my eye (I was sitting next to a large window).  Right away, I ran outside on the porch. The light's hovered for about 15 seconds then faded away. There was about 10 lights, and they were in the shape of an oval. I stayed out on the porch and a few minutes later 8 red lights right next to each other hovered across the whole sky. It was so crazy that I ran back inside and woke up my son. We waited on the porch for some time. A bit later, the flashing green lights appeared again this time they were hovering across the sky (15 seconds). They were the same shape and everything. Towards the end the stopped flashing and turned orange. We waited for another 20 minutes and nothing happened. I put my son to bed and found this website. As I writing this report the green lights appeared again! They were the same as before. They hovered for over a minute this time. At the end, they all disappeared excep! t one which out of nowhere fell out of the sky unimaginably fast. It looked like it hit the ocean (we were right next to the ocean).  I don't really believe in UFO's , but after what just happened I don't know what to think. I have never seen anything like this.;38.3378;-75.0873

Two fireballs observed over Atlantic Ocean from Ocean City, Maryland, hotel balcony.  ((anonymous report));2017-08-04 22:00:00;2 minutes;Two fireballs observed over Atlantic Ocean from Ocean City, Maryland, hotel balcony. While on vacation in Ocean City, Maryland, wife and myself witnessed unusual sight over Atlantic Ocean while sitting on balcony of hotel room.  Date was either 8/3/17, 8/4/17, or 8/5/17 (donâ€™t recall which of those three nights) approximate time 22:00 hours. Witnessed a fireball traveling parallel to the coast, heading from the north to the south, about the speed of a normal aircraft.  Seemed to be within a few miles of our location.  It turned east over the ocean, appeared on a trajectory to higher altitude, again at normal aircraft speed, and extinguished after about 10 seconds.  No aircraft warning or marker lights were visible nor could we hear any sound.  Fireball was visible for approximately 50 to 60 seconds total. A second identical sighting was witnessed 5 to 10 minutes after the first. Note that Dover Delaware Air Force Base.  Is not far north of our location.  Unsure if it might have been afterburners from jets conducting nighttime training. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
