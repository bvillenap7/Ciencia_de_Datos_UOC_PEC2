After and hour it came back and stayed 5 minutes then left again very quickly.  I am at 39.37 and 75.08 and it was east and north of me - over the ocean??  Very high (maybe like Polaris) and too far away to see clearly.  White blinking light in a round shape without binoculars and white blinking with red, some blue blinking light with binoculars.  If it had not left that spot it would not have been unusual.  Then to return and leave again definitely got our interest.   Just before sunset, two Air Force fighter jets flew very low over our area following the coastline.  Not unusal because Dover AFB is an hour North of here but unusual that they were so low.;38.3378;-75.0873

Circular lights in V formation that moved  very quickly and changed patterns.;2010-07-31 23:00:00;10 seconds;Circular lights in V formation that moved  very quickly and changed patterns. My brother in law and wife and I were on the deck of our beach house.  We were commenting on how beautful the stars were, how clear the sky was.  My brother in law commented on different constellations and I mentioned how on the night before my brother and I used an application on his phone that would tell you what you were looking at in the sky.   I looked up and saw what looked like a group of birds in V formation but in light form.  I thought that was odd and continued to look and the lights moved very quickly and then shifted from V formation to where the left side of circular lights moved to the right side and then disappeared.   I said look, look, and by the time my brother in law and sister looked it, the cirular lights of around 10 lights in V formation was gone.   They thought I was seeing things, but I have never seen anything like this.  Still gives me goosebumps. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Total of three balls of white light flying north to south.;2013-07-08 22:15:00;Few seconds;Total of three balls of white light flying north to south. My wife and I were sitting on the balcony of our hotel room and we saw a white ball of light fly by at an incredible speed high in the sky.  It was not descending like a shooting star, and seemed to be changing directions.   After sitting there stunned for a while we then saw two more objects flying across the horizon, above the ocean.  These looked longer in shape, white light, not blinking.   These two objects changed positions and seemed to be in a formation.   These two objects disappeared in the ocean or possibly over the horizon.   We then sat out for another hour with no other incidents.;38.3378;-75.0873
