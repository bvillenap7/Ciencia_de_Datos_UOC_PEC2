White diamond out over ocean in daylight... hovering  (over 2 hours);2020-09-07 12:00:00;>2 hours;White diamond out over ocean in daylight... hovering  (over 2 hours) Around 12:45 p.m. today (east coast time), I was sitting on my ocean front balcony facing east.  The sky was clear blue with clouds out far over the ocean.  I noticed a white dot hovering out over the ocean...many miles out.  It was about 2-3 inches above the horizon.  It was still & not moving.  I kept watching & finally decided to get my grandfathers old binoculars.  Through them, it looked like either a square or diamond shape, but solid white.  It can be seen with the naked eye as just a white dot, but through the binocs, it had the square or diamond shape.  Definitely had 4 points.  I then remembered I had newer & stronger binoculars in my Jeep.  I walked out & grabbed them, & returned to the balcony (5 min duration).  I saw the same thing through the stronger binocs, but could def. see a diamond shaped object.  With the clouds & lines in the clouds as my backdrop, I could clearly see the object wasn't moving up/down, or left/right.  I was planning on going to the beach, & after watching this for 30-40 minutes, I gathered my stuff & walked out to the beach (10 min duration).  I brought the stronger binoculars & continued watching from the beach level.  My balcony is about 20 feet above the beach FYI.  I watched this object for another 30-40 minutes, when at 1 point, I looked in that direction, & it was gone.  I continued looking in the general direction of where it was for another hour or 2, but it never returned.  It was very far out over the ocean, it never moved, & was still the entire time.  It was the only thing in the sky, that far out, bright white, & about the size of a pencil eraser, from where I watched from.;38.3378;-75.0873
