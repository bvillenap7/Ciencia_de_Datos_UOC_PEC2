UFO over Ocean City, Maryland;2010-11-27 23:30:00;01min;UFO over Ocean City, Maryland My girlfriend and I had just returned from the Clarion and were staying at the Carousel on 118th street in Ocean City, Md.  It was around an estimated 1130pm, November 27th, 2010 and we were out on the balcony.  Our room was on the 2nd level, oceanfront, so we were about 50yds from the coastline.  She was reclining on one of the balcony chairs and I stated, Hey baby, baby.  What is that?   When i noticed it, the object was directly perpendicular to me traveling in a southern direction 40-50yds above the coastline, probably 30 or 40yds from my deck.  I estimate the speed of the unidentified object to be around 25-30mph.  It was dark and very quiet that night and there was not a sound to be heard besides a very ominous silence.  Perhaps a humming or a feeling of something actually being there was what made me look to the sky.  What i saw was a silouette of a triangular craft with about 9 afterburners on the underside.  Four or five on the left definetly, four or five on! the right that were harder to make out because of the difficult angle which really gives a better visual as to how close this craft really was to my position, and 1 afterburner in the lead on this craft which was heading south along the coastline.  These lights were very odd in that they didn't glow bright like any typical vertical afterburner or exhaust nor did they burn like any conventional horizontal exhaust type aircraft.  These lights maintained a steady maroon/deep dull red glow that almost blended in with the nightscape.  I watched it travel at least 75 yds before it disappeared and during this event there was still no evidence of any type of lights.  I spent 4yrs on an aircraft carrier so I know personally that when an aircraft flys along a coast with no port or starboard lights, no running lights, and no sound whatsoever at such a low altitude, then it must be unidentified.  I challenge anyone to give a flight log of anyone flying the coast that night between the hours of 11pm and 1am that night.;38.3378;-75.0873
