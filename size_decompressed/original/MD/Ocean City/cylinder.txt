We were dumbstruck and discussed it at the time.  Once it passed the moon we could no longer see it.  I have posted many questions on the internet trying to find other people who saw it with no luck.   I cannot believe we are the only people who saw it since it was a beautiful night the moon was full and, no, we were not under any chemical influences. I am a retired high school teacher my daughter is currently a stay-at-home mom who recently worked in a financial institution.;38.3378;-75.0873
