flash of light! possibly abduction!;2001-07-24 10:00:00;1 second;flash of light! possibly abduction! About 3 years ago my mother and I were driving back from Ocean City. There were more people in the car ,but we recall it best. Anyway, we were driving back when we saw a white light in the sky. it looked as if it was getting closer and closer. then everything was white for a second. After the incodent we looked at the sky ,hoping to catch another glimpse, but only found the same calm night stars. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.
