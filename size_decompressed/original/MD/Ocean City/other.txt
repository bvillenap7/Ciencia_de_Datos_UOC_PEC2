Today, 11/16/07 I visited your site again since 8/7/07 and was happy to see my first posting up, so now I would like to post the second one.  The summer of 1990 my extended family was visiting from overseas, and we decided to vacation in Ocean City, MD.  On or about July 20, 1990 after a long day shopping and enjoying the beach weather, my brother and I walked down to the beach for a smoke.  We sat on the shore and talked, when I noticed a set of triangular lights that seemed to dance around each other in the night sky. At first I just thought they were stars, but I also noticed they would blink every now and then, as if they disappeared and reappeared again.  At first I thought, the motion of the waves might have influence over balance, and perhaps on a clear night stars really do twinkle, so I quickly dismissed it as just a quirk. Then suddenly I saw one light dart away from the other two. At first I had hesitated in telling my brother what I had seen, but noticing that the other two lights had now followed the stray light from East to West, I asked him to look up in the sky and tell me what he saw.    My brother then affirmed what I had seen, and we began to speculate as to what it could be, he was the first to say it might be UFOs.  This went on for about 30 minutes, it was definitely not something that was just momentary, it seemed as if the three lights danced around each other, followed each other, and perhaps signaled each other. This is my second sighting, both of which I've witnessed with two different family members, who can verify my stories. I would like to further add that coincidentally on August 1977 I became psyschically intuned with departed loved ones through dreams.  I just find it fascinating that my first sighting which was a direct encounter with a saucer might have enhanced these abilities or are directly attributed to them.  Since my encounters I've read many books, including the powerful Edgar Cayce on Indigo children which represent a new evolutionary human society.  Emissaries from heaven is the term that is associated with children with psychic abilities.  I was 13 when I became psychically aware.  I want to thank your website for helping me realize that what I have witnessed is not something I dreamt up.;38.3378;-75.0873

Fenwick Island Orange UFO;2009-08-15 23:59:00;5 Minutes;Fenwick Island Orange UFO About midnight Saturday August 15th, on Fenwick Island, we observed an orange object moving in the sky from South to North. The object appeared to be an orange light in the shape of a figure 8.  I pointed the object out to all the people at the party. The object then slowed and appeared to descend to about 1500 ft.  The was no noise.  The object then appeared to stop and was motionless.  After about 2 minutes the object began to ascend almost straight up but slightly to the north at a great speed, and seemed to disappear into space.;38.3378;-75.0873
Glowing green orb object seen during iPhone video playback.;2013-07-09 21:00:00;0.08;Glowing green orb object seen during iPhone video playback My sister was filming the ride The Sling Shot with her IPhone on the board walk. She didn't notice anything unusual during that time until she played the video back on in the car on the way home. We noticed on the video a strange green colored glowing butterfly shaped object following the ride as it went up and down. The object was approximately 20 ft from the actual ride and moved with the bouncing ride similar to the natural movement of the ride itself but then took a sudden turn as the ride was bouncing back down after the 2nd bounce and went in the opposite direction of the falling/bouncing ride. As the ride was coming back down during its final bounce the object suddenly shot back up into the sky in a very fast zig zag direction and vanished. We couldn't explain what it was on the way home and then my sisters daughter said that it had something to do with the iPhone itself because during the ride home my niece also made a short video of her sister in the car and said that she had the same object on her phone for a short period only too. We played her video back which was around 30 seconds long of her filming her little sister singing in the car and sure enough there was the same strange green object floating around on her screen for only about 5 seconds then disappeared as well. After we reviewed her video both my sister and my niece tried to see if this would happened again by making a short video in the car using both phones and after several attempts to see if the video would produce the green glowing bounce object it would not. I don't understand why it happened only on the boardwalk and in the car just the two times. Does it have something to do with the iPhone?  Or was it something following us home from the boardwalk and would only display itself during those two videos?
