star sized object  spinning circles over Ocean City Maryland in 2002;2002-06-06 23:00:00;5 seconds;star sized object  spinning circles over Ocean City Maryland in 2002 I was at the beach walking down the board walk just looking out over the ocean.   Looking at the sky i saw a dot, about the size of a star, i dont remember if the dot was red or green because this was a number of years ago, but my best guess would be green.  This object appeared out of nowhere out over the horizon, it shot northwest at amazing speed, then stopped in mid air, spun a few circles then made a straight shot northeast at amazing speed,stopped, spun another couple circles, stopped then shot off into space, getting smaller and smaller leaving a sort of glowing trail behind it.  This object was about twice as fast as a shooting star.  I cannot tell how many miles this thing covered because it was night and so far away but it did cover a great distance from what i could tell ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
