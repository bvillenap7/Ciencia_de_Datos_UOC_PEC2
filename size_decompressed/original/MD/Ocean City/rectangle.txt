Black rectangle never saw it move.;2019-06-18 17:00:00;3 minutes;Black rectangle never saw it move. All of us saw this black rectangle craft. It was days after a airshow in Ocean City MD. We were going out to eat and just left our beach house it was about 5:00pm.  I looked up into a very blue sky and there it was all black and 2D.  I could not tell how hi it was because there was nothing to compare it to nor could I tell the size of the craft.  We watched it a short time then went to eat.  None of us saw it move a inch it just hung there with no noise.;38.3378;-75.0873
