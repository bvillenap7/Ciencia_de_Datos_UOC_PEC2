A bright light moving across the sky getting closer stopped on a dime got brighter and took off with no sounds at all;2009-10-11 04:00:00;5 to 10 min;A bright light moving across the sky getting closer stopped on a dime got brighter and took off with no sounds at all I was on vacation in Maryland at Jane’s island state located 26280 Alfred J Lawson Dr. I got up at 3:30 am to go down to the dock to get an early start on crabbing. The still night sky was very clear and the stars seemed to be very close as well as a lot of them. I got my traps into the water and sat in my chair as I heard a plane going overhead. I looked up to locate its flashing lights and I did. Seconds later I was still gazing at the stars as I always do I noticed an odd looking star. I thought nothing of it until it stared to move. I’ve seen many falling stars or shooting stars. What ever you want to call them so I’m pretty familiar about what they look like. As this particular one was moving very fast it stopped on a dime. Note this sighting was also very close. I would say roughly 200 to 300 yards away. When it stopped it sat there for 10 to 15 seconds. It then made a 90-degree turn away from me, but as it was turning it was getting brighter like flam! es out of a rocket. Then it got even brighter like a thrust or something and shot across the sky moving parallel to the canal. What ever this thing was moved faster then a plane. I continued to watch this to me a UFO until I couldn’t see it anymore. Thank for your time, and if you have any questions please contact me.;37.9834;-75.8457
