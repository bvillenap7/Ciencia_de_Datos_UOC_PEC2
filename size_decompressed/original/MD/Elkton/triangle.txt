I got in my deer stand around 3:30 am   after sitting there for about 5 to 10 minutes. I looked up in the black sky and seen soom lights there were three white lights and a row of colored lights in the back,red,green,blue,yellow and think there was ornge.  As it came closer i could tell it was a triangle shape.It came down tree top leavel about 25 yards away from me on the other side of the creak.When it started across the creak the row of colored lights went out.  Then a beam of light came out of the middle.  When it got wright over me i could not see the ship just the out line and the ligts it blended with the night sky.It made no sound what so every.  It was only about 15 feet from me.I never seen any thing fly so slow.It seamed to last only for about 5 minutes.  About two years latter i relized when it was leaving it was starting to get day light.  So now im wondering what happend because it hade to last alot longer than what i could remember.  So what happend to me i guess ill never know.The worst part is not knowing.  I only told a couple of pepole of course they all laughed at me and told me i was crazy.  I know what i saw and its the truth. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD));39.6248999999999;-75.8351
