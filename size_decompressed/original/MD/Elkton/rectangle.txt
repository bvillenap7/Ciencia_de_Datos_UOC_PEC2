Large 40 ft rectangular object, large white beams of light in each corner shining down, quietly flying 100 ft up just above the trees.;2017-03-06 22:00:00;2 minutes;Large 40 ft rectangular object, large white beams of light in each corner shining down, quietly flying 100 ft up just above the tree s Extremely large object thought it was a plane flying 100 ft above the ground just above the trees behind our house flying from North to South.  I was looking out the back door looking south and noticed it flying very quietly and slowly.  It looked sort of like a plane with shiny metal color but was flying way to low and quietly to be a plane and was more rectangular not like it had wings.  It had 4 very large white beams of light in each corner of the object shining down, looked like search lights.  I yelled up to my husband to look out the upstairs back bedroom window after it had gone past a bit but he didn't see it.  My husband asked if it was a drone, and I thought maybe it was but just went online and saw what large drones look like and don't think it was a drone.  I am curious if it could have been a plane flying that low. ((NUFORC Note:  For some reason, source of report indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));39.6248999999999;-75.8351
