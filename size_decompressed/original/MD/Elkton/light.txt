A light descended slowly into the Elk River, just off the Chesapeake Bay.;1993-07-15 17:30:00;5 minutes;A light descended slowly into the Elk River, just off the Chesapeake Bay. Coming off the Chesapeake Bay onto the Elk River on our boat, my father and I watched a bright light descend from the sky in a controlled manor and enter the water about half a mile in front of us.  Confused and thinking perhaps a plane had crashed (although like I said, it came down slowly and under control) we proceeded over to the area but found no wreckage and no evidence of anything in the water (ie. lights).  The object didn't disappear behind the curvature of the earth because there were trees in the distance behind it that it definitely passed in front of, giving us a reference point as to it's location.  Neither of us had been drinking, we were left totally baffled.  The Elk River is a well traveled river, it has a very deep channel and is used by freighters passing through on their way to Baltimore and is also very close to Aberdeen Military Proving Grounds.  Other residents in the area have stories of strange things they see including odd looking crafts in the s! ky moving at unusually fast speeds (or sometimes just hovering) and doing outrageous maneuvers such as sharp, sudden turns.

BRIGHT WHITE STROBE LIKE LIGHT WITH A BEAM SHINING DOWN, VERY, VERY LOUD;2002-02-01 21:00:00;30 MINUTES;BRIGHT WHITE STROBE LIKE LIGHT WITH A BEAM SHINING DOWN, VERY, VERY LOUD ABOUT 8:45 PM ON FRIDAY FEB 1 2 OF MY CHILDREN AND I WERE SITTING IN THE LIVING ROOM TALKING AND I HEARD A NOISE THAT AT THE TIME I THOUGHT WAS JUST A LARGE TRUCK COMING DOWN MAIN STREET. IT GOT LOUDER AND LOUDER. I KEPT WAITING FOR THIS TRUCK TO PASS. IT SOUNDED LIKE IT WAS RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE. IT WAS SO LOUD THAT WE WERE TRYING TO TALK OVER IT. WHEN THE SOUND DIDN'T RECEDE I WENT TO MY KITCHEN THINKING THAT MY DISHWASHER WAS GETTING READY TO EXPLODE (THE SOUND WAS SO LOUD AND SO CLOSE). IN THE KITCHEN I LOOKED OUT THE WINDOW AND ACROSS THE STREET OVER A HOUSE I SAW A VERY BRIGHT LIGHT WITH A BEAM THAT WAS SHINING DOWN BEHIND THE HOUSE. AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS A POLICE HELICOPTER SEARCHING FOR SOMEONE. BUT IT WAS SO LOUD (SO LOUD THAT YOU COULD ALMOST FEEL IT) AND THE CRAFT (WHICH I COULD NOT SEE BECAUSE IT WAS SO DARK AND THE LIGHT COMING FROM THE BOTTOM OF IT WAS SO BRIGHT)WAS NOT MOVING. IT WAS STATIONARY. SO I RAN OUTSIDE TO GET A BETTER LOOK AND THE NOISE WAS UNBELEIVABLY LOUD. I'VE NEVER HEARD A POLICE HELICOPTER SOUND LIKE THIS. MY TWO YOUNGEST KIDS CAME OUT TO SEE WHAT IT WAS AND THEY WERE SCARED. I TOO WAS SCARED. AT THIS POINT MY OLDEST CAME FROM UPSTAIRS TO FIND OUT WHAT THIS NOISE WAS. SO WE ALL WATCHED THIS THING BUT COULDN'T MAKE OUT THE SHAPE OF THE CRAFT. IT JUST SAT RIGHT ABOVE THIS HOUSE FOR THE LONGEST TIME WITH THIS BEAM SHINING DOWN. AT ONE POINT IT STARTED TO MOVE SLOWLY AND WHEN IT DID WE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF THE LIGHT UNDERNEATH. I CAN ONLY DESCRIBE A LIGHT SO BRIGHT THAT YOU COULDN'T LOOK DIRECTLY INTO IT. THE LIGHT WAS ROUND LIKE A STROBE LIGHT. A BUNCH OF LIGHTS MAKING UP THIS STROBE LIGHT. THE LIGHTS WERE WHITE. WHEN THIS THING MOVED WE RAN INTO THE HOUSE BECAUSE WE WERE SCARED OF THAT BEAM AND DIDN'T WANT TO GET CAUGHT UNDERNEATH IT. WE WERE LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW AND IT WAS MOVING (NOT FAST) FLYING OVER OUR HOUSE. WE COULDN'T SEE IT ANYMORE BUT THE BEAM STILL SHONE DOWN BEHIND THE HOUSE ACROSS THE STREET (FROM SOMEWHERE IN THE SKY BEHIND OUR HOUSE) I CALLED MY HU! SBAND AT WORK AND TOLD HIM WHAT WE WERE SEEING AND I TOOK THE PHONE OUTSIDE SO HE COULD HEAR BECAUSE IT WAS STILL REAL LOUD, AFTER HEARING IT HE CAME STRAIGHT HOME. BUT IT WAS GONE. WHAT STRUCK ME AS EVEN ODDER WAS THAT WHILE ME AND THE KIDS WERE OUTSIDE CHECKING THIS THING OUT, NO ONE ELSE CAME OUT OF THEIR HOUSES. I KEPT LOOKING AROUND TO SEE IF ANY OF THE NEIGHBORS WERE OUT LOOKING AT THIS THING BUT I DIDN'T EVEN SEE ANYONE LOOKING OUT OF THEIR WINDOWS.;39.6248999999999;-75.8351

Two bright fast lights.;2016-12-28 19:20:00;5-10 minutes;Two bright fast lights While driving to visit family, we spotted two abnormally bright orange/red lights in the sky. Observed for a few minutes, stopped and got out of the car as one of the lights became even brighter than within seconds it traveled straight up and disappeared.   The second light did the same thing.   Have never seen something travel so fast nor straight up in our lifetime.;39.6248999999999;-75.8351
