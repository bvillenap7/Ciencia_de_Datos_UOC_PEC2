Several craft at different speeds cross sky at approx same high attitude.;2013-08-04 21:15:00;5 minutes;Several craft at different speeds cross sky at approx same high attitude.  Shined high powered spot lite and laser at 1 and it stopped, then proceeded. I went back inside because mosquitoes were to bad. These were not regular planes or airliners. Viewed with binoculars there were no lights, just solid silver, with plasma field. This is not my first sighting. I had a very close encounter at the age of 12.
