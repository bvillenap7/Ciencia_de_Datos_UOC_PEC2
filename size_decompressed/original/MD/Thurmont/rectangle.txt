I heard the dryer inside going and was scrolling through Facebook.  I looked up from the screen to see what I thought was a plane getting ready to land at Frederick airport, which is about 20 miles away.  But I noticed it didnt move and the light on it was getting brighter.  Now it was probably a good 2-3 miles from the house.  It looked like a star.  It shot straight up.  Then without a sound it wizzed above and past my house.   As it past and got closer. I noticed it was triangular in shape and black but had three round lights on the bottom.  The closer it got the bigger it looked.  I would say at a whole the ship was the size of a jet plane.  But a full black triangle.  And the round lights where probably a good 4-5 feet in diameter. It was very quiet.  I heard a slight hum as it passed over me.  I've been wanting to tell someone but didn't want to sound crazy.  I don't know what it was.  But it definitely sent me inside for the night.;39.6128;-77.3991
