Bright orb shape, travels slightly then vanishes.;2013-08-01 22:00:00;3 minutes;Bright orb shape, travels slightly then vanishes My husband and I were in our backyard to have a cigerrete before calling it a night.  I noticed almost immediately a bright ball at 12 o'clock southeast.  It was still, not flashing but bright.  I said to my husband oh wow look I think that must be Jupiter or one of the planets look how bright and close it is.  Mind you I have been watching it for almost two mins now.  I love to look up at night. My husband said where, so he looked up to direction I was looking and I pointed.  I swear the second I pointed at the orb its light shrunk down to look like every other star and began to quickly move about two to three inches right ( but thousands of feet up) then just vanished.  It was if they knew they were spotted and took off.  I said to my husband I think we just saw a UFO. Then we both felt scared and ran inside.  I know it was not a plane.  They don't stand still and always have some flashing light and it was not a helicopter, there was no noise at all.  I do live 5 minutes from Pax River Navy base so planes and helicopters come and go all hours of the day and usually shake my house.  `Again this was silent, and looked to me like a bright close planet that just vanished.;38.2674;-76.4954
