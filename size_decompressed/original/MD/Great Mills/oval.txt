My mother called me at approximately 11:19 am on 12/20/12, she was at the stop light up from the street of our house.  She looked accross the street to the elementary school, and said she could see what she thought was spaceships.  The next day my daughter was at school, and her friend told her he was walking outside of the high school that same day, and saw 2 spaceships.  I have a pic to prove, what they saw.;38.2674;-76.4954
