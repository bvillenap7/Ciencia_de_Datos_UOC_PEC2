THE OBJECT WAS TOO BIG TO BE AN AIRCRAFT AND WAS HOVERING FOR THE MOST PART  OF MY OBSERVATION;2019-10-12 22:00:00;15 minutes;THE OBJECT WAS TOO BIG TO BE AN AIRCRAFT AND WAS HOVERING FOR THE MOST PART  OF MY OBSERVATION WAS TRAVELING SOUTH ON NEW HAMPSHIRE AVENUE INTO THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.  I NOTICED A TRIANGULAR SHAPE OF WHITE LIGHTS ALONG THE PERIPHERY OF THE OBJECT IN THE SKY.  THOUGHT IT WAS UNUSUAL, IT ALSO HAD AN UNSUAL TAIL OF LIGHTS AT THE BOTTOM ALMOST IN A SWERVED OR ZIG ZAG SHAPE.  IT MUST HAVE BEEN HUGH BECAUSE OF THE WIDTH AND LENGHT I OBSERVED.  I TURNED ON SHERIDAN OFF OF NEW HAMSPHIRE, THEN RIGHT ONTO KNOLLBROOK DR. APPROACHING CHILLUM RD WHERE I COULD STOP TO TRY TO TAKED A PICTURE.  WHILE ADJ USTING MY CELL PHONE I LOOKED UP AND THE OBJECT HAD DISAPPEARED.  WHEN I NOTICED A STREAM OF LIGHTS MOVING IN A STRAIGHT LINE ON THE LEFT SIDE WHICH WAS APRROACHING A SMALL WHITE CLOUD.  I NOTICED ON MY RIGHT THE OBJECT HAD REAPPEARED JUST A SHORT DISTANCE AWAY FROM WHERE I HAD ORIGINALLY SEEN IT.  I COULD NOT CAPTURE THE OBJECT ON MY CELL PHONE SINCE APPARENTLY IT WAS TOO HIGH IN THE SKY.  I KNOW THAT WE HAVE A SPACE STATION IN VIRGINIA AND I THOUGHT PERHAPS IT WAS NEAR THAT AREA.;38.9559663716815;-76.931753097345

My boyfriend started freaking out on the phone. He told me he just saw a UFO on BW Parkway. He said it was hovering over the Parkway then it turned on this very bright light. He then said as he was trying to call me his phone shut down and wiped all contacts out of his phone. He then told me the object took off leaving a bright trail of blue light in the dark skies. The UFO was tree level. He could barely tell me what was wrong he literally was scared shitless. He said it looked as if it was about to land on the Parkway but the closer he got to it the more it the brighter the light would get a unique blue light is how he describe it.
