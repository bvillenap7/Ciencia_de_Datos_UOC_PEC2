It seemed very close to the earth  at dusk with no other stars visible in the sky, but as the night progressed, the object did not move and other stars in the sky were barley visible.   I have photos and no one can seem to identify it.  It looked like a circle or star of white light.  With my camera on zoom, there were some red lights in it.  It did not move for about 3 hours.;38.9559663716815;-76.931753097345
