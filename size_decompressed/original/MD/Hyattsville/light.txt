I was sitting in my car in an apartment parking lot, and I saw what looked like two headlights of a car.  I first thought it was two helicopters searching for something.   Then the light on the left (facing me) begin to move slowly beside the other light until the two lights became one.  I thought to myself if it was a helicopter it would be impossible for the two to get so close.  After a couple of seconds they separated and flew in opposite directions with red & white blinking lights like on an aircraft.  The direction in which I was facing I could see the power light (red) from the train station but these lights where further off in the sky.  I looked in the daylight to see if there was some tall tower with lights and I did not see anything.  It may have been the airforce or something but I thought it was strange.  I watch the news to see if any testing or training was going on in the airspace and nothing has been reported.  Of course my family thinks I am crazy, not sure what I saw but I saw something.;38.9559663716815;-76.931753097345
