Confused;2013-06-05 11:06:00;1 minute;My girlfriend and I were relaxing on the bay looking east towards the eastern shore when what seemed to come straight out of the water a red flare begins to rise steady upward at a rate of speed much faster then any other objects in the sky I.e. the planes in the distance  anyways we watched it keep going up till it passed through one cloud my gf thought it disappeared then a couple of seconds later reappeared heading on the same coarse straight up for maybe 15 to 20 more seconds then the red ball eventually disappeared  The entire event lasted no more then 1 minute. After it was gone we notice the vapor trail from it passing through the clouds . I am very confused and would like to think it is just a serimonlly candle balloon but I doubt it.;38.7838;-76.5574
