Three lights surrounded by smoke;2003-01-28 05:30:00;60-90 seconds;Three lights surrounded by smoke I was driving along I-795 North.  Initally I saw two lights surrounded by a large amount of smoke...at first I thought it was a traffic helicopter having problems.  As I continued to watch - the lights seemed to rotate.  Next I saw three lights in a straight line and the smoke disappeared as the lights took off - about the speed of a commercial jet.  I pulled over and watched the lights move high into the sky (what I would say was higher than a commercial aircraft flying pattern in our area) and south until didn't see them anymore.  I had about 5-7 mile visibility from where I pulled over.  I didn't hear any noise, and I would estimate the lights were about 1/4 mile away from me and maybe the equivalent of 10-15 floors (as compared to a building) off the ground.;39.4234;-76.7762000000001
