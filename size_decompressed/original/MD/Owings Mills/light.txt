Bright white object observed to the Westat about treetop level, gained altitude andflew off silently;1997-03-26 22:10:00;5 minutes;Summary : Bright white object observed to the West at about treetop level, gained altitude and flew off silently Saw a bright white object which appeared to be hovering at treetop level a few miles to the West of my home in Owings Mills Md. The light was pulsating about once/second, and was much brighter than any aircraft light I had everseen. After a minute or two, it gained altitude and flew off to the southeast. As soon as it stopped hovering, the light dimmed to a more normal level. As it flew off, I sawa blinking red light near the white one. Itwas too  dark to see anything of the craft itself.I initially thought it was a Helicopter with a searchlight, but it was absolutely silent.  We have helicopter overflights on occasion,both military and commercial, and, at thedistance I observed this object, they arequite easily heard. The neighborhood wasquiet, and I should have been able to heara helicopter. Also, if it was a searchlight,it was not pointed at the ground as one wouldhave expected with a helicopter.I am a 40 year old Electronics Engineer, and am a stable individual. We just moved intothis house in Owings Mills last summer. Itis a more rural area than our last house,and has frequent overflights by military cargo planes flying in a corridor thatusually extends from the southwest to thenortheast.;39.4234;-76.7762000000001
2 bright white lights sitting above the beltway, not moving whatsoever.;2011-03-11 23:10:00;1 minute;2 bright white lights sitting above the beltway, not moving whatsoever. Was driving down 695 (East bound) from Owings Mills MD (from 795 S).  It was in the area of 695 where there is construction and the speed camera installed in a vehicle.  Was driving through the construction zone and noticed two oddly bright white lights sitting over the beltway. I have never noticed too many planes flying through the area and since the lights were not moving I automatically threw out the idea that it was a plane.  It did not move at all and was at an odd height.  Too high to be any sort of pole or something used to light up the immediate area.  When I was driving uder it, I could not make out any shape but may have noticed a red light that flashed.  Not entirely sure. Either way the lights were very suspicious given the area (695 beltway in the Baltimore area), so I doubted it was military craft.   I am sure many others who were driving noticed this as well.

Golden yellow lights moving around in the sky like 20 planes in same direction and disappearing one by one.;2014-09-20 19:55:00;10;Golden yellow lights moving around in the sky like 20 planes in same direction and disappearing one by one. Dear sir/Madam,   This is in regards to the unusual scene I noticed in the sky on 09/20/14 at 7:55 pm near Catonsville.  I saw some golden yellow lights moving around in sky they were as if  20 to 25 planes moving in the same direction.   After sometimes the lights disappeared one by one.  Initially my husband refused to see, as he was driving.  When we stopped, he and my daughter were totally shocked.   I don't know if it was some kind of UFO or something else.  But I'm quite sure it is not normal, if it was meteor shower then it would seem to be falling not moving here and there and going off.  We are very curious to know what it is?  Thank you.;39.4234;-76.7762000000001
