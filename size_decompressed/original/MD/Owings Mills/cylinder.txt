Bright cylinder that hovered and moved rapidly.;2014-08-28 19:45:00;2-3 minutes;Bright cylinder that hovered and moved rapidly. My husband and I were coming home from work at approximately 19:45 on the evening of Thursday, August 28, 2014.  We turned onto the road that our apartment complex is on and out of the corner of my husbandâ€™s eye, he spied a bright light.  He told me to turn the car around to see the object more clearly.  As I turned the car around, I saw the object. The object was moving side to side and up and down at a fairly rapid rate.  Then the object seemed to stop and hover.  It then moved very rapidly to the right and hovered again.  It then moved to the left, then up and down and went below the tree line. We were sitting in a parking lot as we were watching the object. It had a bright white glow about it.  We did not hear any noise or sound from it.  We believe it was about a mile away.  Granted, if there was a sound, it may have been drowned by the traffic noise. Once the object was below the tree line, I drove in the direction of the object however, we were not able to locate it again.;39.4234;-76.7762000000001
