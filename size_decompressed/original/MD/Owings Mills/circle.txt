It moved from side to side and would hover and then it would stop moving and descend.  The blue would get really bright, then dull.  Then, within minutes it disappeared among the trees.   I called the police to report what I witnessed.;39.4234;-76.7762000000001
Blue, bright light.  Moving fast and circular movement.;2017-01-01 19:05:00;15 minutes;Blue bright light.  Moving fast and circular movement. I was trying to see moon from my telescope, and all of a sudden, blue light appeared from left side of the moon and went to right side.  Changed light once to red and back to blue before I started recording.  It was not a full moon, but in the video I took it appears full round some how.  Blue circle was moving very fast and different patterns.  Blue light was very bright.  At once it was going towards incoming airplane and than all of a sudden it changed direction.  I'll send video clip that I took.  Just trying to figure out what was the object I saw that night?;39.4234;-76.7762000000001
