The movements were unusual so we began to drive closer to the object.  As we approached the object it changed color from a royal blue to a bright white and stopped in mid air.   It then changed course and began moving in the direction of the car and changed color 2 more times before changing course again and moved back towards the development.;39.4234;-76.7762000000001
