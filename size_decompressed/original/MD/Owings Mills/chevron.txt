A boomerang shaped UFO with lighted edges flies by Oryan's (spelling) Belt.;2004-04-09 22:14:00;about 10 sec.;A boomerang shaped UFO with lighted edges flies by Oryan's (spelling) Belt. My dog needed to go out for a walk, so I put on my glasses and slippers and went outside to walk her.  I looked up and noticed Oryan's(unsure of spelling) Belt, when out of nowhere a Boomerang like shape came turning towards me, it had lights going around the edges of it.  I first thought it was a plane, but then i noticed that there was no sound anywheres except for crickets and my dog growling(she has never growled at anything before) and the fact that there was no tail or flashing lights, then all the lights began 2 flicker and the weaker ones, like my flash light, went out.  It was traveling to the left, I stuck with North and South directions, but I think it was NW.  It turned away from me, North I think, and disappeared.  A sec later all the lights came on brighter then ever, like the batteries were recharged.  I ran in side and was talking with my friend, online, about it and some girls in school.  He told me that it was probably a gov't space craft or something, but then I realized that it was too thin and the angle the wings made weren't the same as gov't space crafts.(I used to be obbsesed with UFO's and gov't space craftes when I was younger)  So he reffered me to this site, and here I am.;39.4234;-76.7762000000001
