The object appeared in the sky, with four birght white lights and one bright red light in the center of the four white ones.  The object hovered for approximately 8 seconds giving me the impression of a round shape, then moved away at an incredible rate of speed in a straight line.  I have never seen anything excelerate quite as fast.  It did not appear to be any type of aircraft I've ever seen.;39.4234;-76.7762000000001
Just read above.;2012-09-20 23:00:00;10 seconds;Just read above. I went out on my deck to have a cigarette about 11:00 pm and saw a bar of very bright lights hovering about 100 to 150 feet above the ground.  The lights were about 20 to 25 feet long, made no noise, and appeared to be swirling with no space in between. Then they shot off over my row of townhouses, leaving light trails that vanished in a couple seconds.  From the light trails, I knew I had seen one edge of a craft.   This was so disturbing I have thought about it every day for the last year.  I've tried to tell family and friends, and have been laughed at, ridiculed, and asked if I was drinking.  I've given up on telling anyone.  But, I know what I saw.;39.4234;-76.7762000000001
