I was attending a football game at Jack Kent Cooke stadium. It was during the third quarter and the Redskins were scoring a touchdown so everyone's attention was focused on the field. I noticed an object out of the corner of my eye and looked up. I saw an object briefly cross upper rim of the stadium. It was dark and diamond shaped with definite edges, but seemed flexible. I had the impression I was looking at a manta ray. On each corner of the object was a very dim light. Object made no noise at all and moved in a manner that could not have been a balloon. The object rose above the rim of the stadium, hovered briefly and then shot off.;38.9403;-76.8959
