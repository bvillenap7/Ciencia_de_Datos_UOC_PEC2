Saw three bright lights and a hovering craft;2012-03-02 01:50:00;40 sec;Saw three bright lights and a hovering craft On 03-02-12 at approximately 0150 hrs. I was driving on the N/B outer loop of the Capitol Beltway (RT 495) in Landover MD when I observed 3 bright white lights in a triangular pattern in the sky.   As I drove north and got closer I noticed the craft had 2 smaller red lights within the pattern.  I slowed down as I got closer to the craft and could see that it was about 200 to 300 feet off of the ground.  I could just make out the triangular shape of the craft and noticed that it was not moving but hovering.    As I drove buy I also noticed that the body of the craft had an angular shape to it.  I pulled to the slow shoulder of the road and looked back to where I the craft should have been but it was gone.;38.9403;-76.8959
