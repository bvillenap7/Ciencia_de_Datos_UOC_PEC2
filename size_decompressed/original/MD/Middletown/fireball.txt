Burst of flame and shot away.;2012-08-08 10:58:00;10 seconds;Burst of flame and shot away. Going down over Braddock Mountain on 70 West, looked up to what i thought was just an airplane, the object was up in the sky to the right.  It bursted into one giant ball of fire and shot to the right and got smaller.  It was a blast of flame (white color) as the flame died away while getting smaller i see a red light on the object.  Watched it for about ten seconds before it completely was not visible anymore;39.4427;-77.5542
