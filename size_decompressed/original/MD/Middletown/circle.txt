Sitting on my side porch right on mainstreet in Middletown on a cloudy night. (moon was in and out of clouds even)  When at airplane height, saw a very bright starlike object, looked like any other star as far as brightness goes but much more circular and definite in shape.  Came out of a cloud and sped at an extremely high speed for prob 3 to 5 seconds then went out like a light would go out immediately not a gradual burn out like a shooting star.  Have seen many shooting stars for I look at the sky almost every night sometimes with a telescope.  Very interesting cant wait to see more!!  Was pretty exciting experience. Also there were other regular airplanes in the sky and this moved about 25 times faster than they were...;39.4427;-77.5542
