Nine orange lights in linear pattern in sky, changed direction, hovered and disappeared.;2009-08-01 23:30:00;5 - 10 mins.;Nine organge lights in linear pattern in sky, changed direction, hovered and disappeared. I was travelling on Rt. 17 South between Myersville and Middletown at 23:30 on August 1, 2009 travelling @ 25 mph.   I saw 9 orange (not red and not yellow) bright lights in the sky in front of me coming from the southeast (Washington, DC) in a straight line formation.  The lights changed direction (east to west) and were travelling at equal speeds (they moved across my horizon in unison).   As I continued down the road south the lights again changed direction toward my car. At this time I decided to pull off to the side of the road.   The lights passed over my car and I looked out my sun roof but the light was too bright to make out the shape of the objects.  I did not hear any sound.   Eight objects increased their speed and each disappeared sequentially heading north.  The last object hovered over my car for 2-3 seconds and then sped off in a northern direction and disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and she sounded to us to be quite sober-minded.  We suspect that the report is quite accurate.  PD));39.4427;-77.5542
My girlfriend and I were outside smoking a ciggarette in the front yard around 23:00 hours on 21OC17.  ((anonymous report));2017-10-21 23:00:00;2-3 seconds;My girlfriend and i were outside smoking a ciggarette in the front yard around 23:00 hours on saturday october 21, 2017.  The front yard faces the north towards pennsylvania.  I noticed a breif flash that caught my attention, I immediately thought it was a meteorite (shooting star).  My girlfriend has never wittnessed a shooting star so i grabed her shoulders and turned her towards the lite object in the sky,it caught her attention as soon as i turned her in the direction of the object, she wittnessed this lit object only for about 1 second. The bright white lit object did not have the charecteristics of a meteorite burning up in the earths atmosphere.  I have wittnesed that experience many times,and they differ of coarse.However this bright white lit object that came from the night sky starting somewhere close to the center point from where the little dipper was and the ground was.I knew it was different from anything ive seen falling from the sky before. It did not burn up and it was going way to slow ...It simply lit up bright white and stayed the same brightness for as long as i could keep it in sight. The house accross the street obstructed our view and it hit the ground... It was round like a globe or diskâ€¦  Bright white.                                           !
