Color changing lights.;2019-04-20 21:45:00;30 seconds;Color changing lights I was on 695, towards White Marsh Blvd.  It was nighttime and I could see an unidentified light in the sky.  The further I drove, I realized how close I was to it.  The best way I could describe it was a flying object with multi-color, sequential and changing LED lights.  The lights changing colors was hypnotizing.  The ufo was low enough for me to realize I was driving under it, and then past it.  It was slowly hovering over the highway.;39.3834416666667;-76.502575
