Bright orbs traveling across the sky in triangular pattern.;2013-11-08 21:15:00;1-2 minutes;Bright orbs traveling across the sky in triangular pattern. Looking up in the sky moving I saw first 3 orbs which could be described as orange and at some points almost purple in color traveling south east.   Another group of three in a triangle followed seconds later followed by one single object.   All of them traveled across the sky at the same rate of speed until they were out of range of sight.   I was able to capture about 1:30 seconds of video on my cell phone, not the highest qualityâ€¦ Their is absolutely no question that these were some sort of craft and nothing we have on this planet.;39.3834416666667;-76.502575
Bright, white light emerged from the hor. and moved upwards.  It vanished completely into the air in about 15 sec. ((anonymous report));2017-12-08 16:34:00;15 seconds;A bright, white light emerged from the horizon, moving upwards. It vanished completely into the air in about fifteen seconds. Mother and I both saw it, and both found it interesting. It could not have been a planet, seeing that the sky was overcast and it was still daylight. It was also not a plane or helicopter - there was no accompanied noise and the body of the aircraft could not be seen through the lights.
