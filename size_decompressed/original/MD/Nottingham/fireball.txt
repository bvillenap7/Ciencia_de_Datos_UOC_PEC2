(facing west towards Towson) WE then looked up to see two reddish objects in the sky.  Then one seemed to catch fire and fall, And seconds following it exploded scattering debris.  Then coming from the South west not to far away, appeared several more reddish craft one by one following the same flight path (And not regular flight path of passenger planes).  As they were coming in some others were approaching from a slight north western approach towards Timonium.  And when each of the aircraft got to the site of explosion, their red lights would go off and appear to vanish but at least 2 that me and my son could see the silhouette of an aircraft with no lights, just black objects.  I didn't have a camera at hand but I did have some binoculars (8x30 field 7.5, if this matters).  I stabilized them on the bench out front and viewed one of the red! dish lights coming in.  The craft was moving to fast to point out a shape but I could clearly see only one light and craft.  So I panned over to a plane in the far distance.  It was farther away and I could clearly see its Red,Green,White lights and could make out the planes shape.) The whole thing lasted about 20 to 30 minutes.  You don't have to report this because I have no footage just my word. But it might help on any other reports. BWI, APG ,and Martins Air base should have picked something up. Not to mention anyone in the Northern Baltimore County could see it who looked westwards and up.;39.3834416666667;-76.502575
