They saw 3 bright saucer shapes in a triangular formation flying across the sky very quickly.  He had recorded them on his phone.  He said they were traveling at such a high speed that he could only capture them for a short time before they disappeared out of the cameraâ€™s view point.

Hundreds of spreading bubbles of different sizes, all glowing green, spread across the sky.   A few minutes later, another cluster appeared and spread across the evening sky.   We have never seen anything like this before.  I tried to film this, but they do not show on film.;39.3834416666667;-76.502575
