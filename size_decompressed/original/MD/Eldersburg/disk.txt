As my friend and I were driving down a long, straight, relatively dark, highway, we saw blinking red and white lights and slowed down, assuming that it was a police officer. As it became closer it was obvious that the lights were blinking in a circular fashion around the bottom of what appeared to be a disc shape. The shape seemed to get lower until it was probably only approximately 100 meters above the car and continued straight along the path of the road heading in the opposite direction. Although it was difficult to judge distance and size accurately (since it was dim with only the light from some nearby buildings and street lights,) it seemed to be the size of a small rancher. I am not someone who was terribly convinced until I witnessed this. The episode gave me a very sinking, powerless feeling. I broke down in tears when I saw it although at first I couldn't even quite place what the object was.;39.4056;-76.9441
