I live near a very wooded area, there are NO small airports around the area.   I was sitting on my back porch, along with my friend.  Previously that night I saw a flying object land far out in the woods (about a mile). I didn't think much of it, although I see the same occurance very often.  A few hours later, at 3:47 hours, I heard strange noises coming from the exact area where the flying object landed.  The only thing I can compare the noises to is steal beams being hit together very rapidly, no one lives in those wood so it's not likely it was coming from a house or factory.  About 1 minute into the beam noises, I heard sevral animals or something like that sqealing very loudly, from the same wooded area, I started to feel really nauseated so I went inside and looked from inside, I was also too scared to stay outside, i've never heard anything like this before.  The noised went on for about 10 minutes (thats a rough estimate) until they stopped. About 5 minutes after they stopped the flying object lifted from the woods but when it was in the sky (red lights) It split into two objects (airplane like objects this time but no noises they were silent) each object went in opposite directions, I then stopped looking. ((NUFORC Note:  No other reports from this area.  We will contact the students who submitted the report and invite them to photograph the alleged landing site, and contact a local investigator.
