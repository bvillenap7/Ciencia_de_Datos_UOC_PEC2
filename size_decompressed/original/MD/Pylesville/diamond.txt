Diamond shaped bright light aircraft seen slowly moving;2021-01-07 18:49:00;2 minutes;Diamond shaped bright light aircraft seen slowly moving A diamond shaped aircraft was moving very slowly and very low in the sky. There were three big, bright lights that created a triangle figure, with two smaller bright lights in the front (stacked) creating the diamond figure.  It hovered or moved very slowly for a while, so I went outside to look at it with binoculars.  After 45 seconds or so it started moving faster, but still quite slow.
