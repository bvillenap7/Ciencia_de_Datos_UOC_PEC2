In west, brilliant point of light (larger than star or planet) & streak fell nearly vertical from sky.;2000-01-16 20:50:00;1-2 seconds;In west, brilliant point of light (larger than star or planet) & streak fell nearly vertical from sky. Almost due west, a very bright point of light leaving a streak, not a tail, fell from the sky toward the ground, in a distance that seemed to be only a mile or two ahead.  It seemed to be traveling not as faast as a meteor but faster than a free fall object.  It appeaared to disappear at treetop level.  I think that it was in front of the mountains +/- 10 miles ahead.   It appeaared to land just north of Williamsport, Md., perhaps in the Potomac River.  No reports of any sightings weere made to any local radio stations, T.V. station, newspapers, or police.  Perhaps it was an object further away & just mistaken for something closer.;39.6415326732674;-77.7260069306929
Bright light over Maryland skies,,,,;2007-09-22 05:25:00;30 mins;Bright light over Maryland skies,,,, The moment of the sighting happened around 5:25 a.m. when my boyfriend was outside smoking a cigarette and suddenly yelled for me to come outside to look at something. At first I thought it was a plane or helicopter hovering very low but then I realized it was definitely something else.  The skies were clear except for a few clouds passing by and there was relatively no wind. The object was extremely bright, brighter than the North Star and its size didn’t compare to a star. It was like 20 stars put together or more. It hovered very low below the clouds and moved left to right very slowly. Even when the clouds passed by, you could still see it shining through. The light would constantly turn off and on and at times it wasn’t visible for about 30 seconds. The shape of the object was like a star that is flattened out and its color was a bright yellow/orange. There are not any military bases near by or radio towers of such, just mountains and open fields.;39.6415326732674;-77.7260069306929
Very illuminous light moving very fast blinked twice then gone.;2012-11-17 00:37:00;2 seconds;Very illuminous light moving very fast blinked twice then gone. Clear night no clouds. Very bright light moving very fast, west to east, south of the city. About 40 degrees up from the horizon.  It just appeared flashed twice then disappeared. Size was about 1/4 in. as seen 6 in. from my face. This is my third sighting at night between midnight and three a.m. in the past 6 weeks. All different sizes and shapes. I heard voices from down the street saying &quotDid you see that&quot. A hoax? I don't know. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to provide no contact information.  PD));39.6415326732674;-77.7260069306929
Unusal lights were observed in one location (not moving) then simply went out.;2013-01-29 23:50:00;50 minutes;Unusal lights were observed in one location (not moving) then simply went out. UFO Siting  Date: 1-29-13 Time:  11:50pm EST   Approximate physical location of craft:  Latitude:  39°41'38.81N Longitude:  77°40'35.08W Altitude:  800 to 1,200 feet above the ground  Description of area:  Lights were observed over farmland with some houses located at the north end of Hagerstown, Maryland in Washington County, Maryland, USA. Description of siting:  There was no visible craft but lights were observed twice within about 1 hour (in the same location).  The first time the lights were observed was by 1 person around 11:00pm and was discounted as a plane but in a strange location (not the typical approach to the local airport).  The second time the lights were observed was at 11:50pm by 2 people.  There were multiple lights with different colors (red, yellow, orange) in roughly a straight line but not exactly lined up. The lights stayed fairly consistent but did appear to fluctuate somewhat.  Then the lights simply went out.  The craft/lights did not appear to move, land, fly away or otherwise act like a plane, helicopter or other normal aircraft. The area that the siting occurred is generally in the path of the local airport (Hagerstown Washington County Regional Airport - HGR) and it is typical for planes to approach the airport from this direction which we observe many times over the years.  When planes come in from a far distance, they appear to be standing still for a few minutes but then move to the left as they approach the airport.  This is the typical observance of landing aircraft seen by us many times.  The first reaction to what was seen on the night of 1-29-13 was that it was just an airplane, but after a few minutes of it not moving, we went to get binoculars, then the lights went out in about seconds.  Aircraft approaching the airport DO NOT turn their lights out completely right before landing!!  If anything, they turn their landing lights on as they get closer.  Again the craft did not appear to move at all and was seen in the same location about 50 minutes apart, then the lights simply went out.  ! We observed the entire area for another 20 minutes looking for the lights to re-appear, they did not. Another concern is that the location of the siting was about +/-10 miles southwest of a military installation known as Site R (aka “the underground Pentagon”) just north of Camp David.  This area is a strict no-fly zone and aircraft approaching the airport (HGR) must abide by the approved flight path. Other observations we noted.  We saw some clouds, stars (big dipper), a nearly full moon, communication towers in the far distance with red blinking lights and several high altitude aircraft with their typical red blinking lights which were much farther up in the sky (perhaps 5,000 ft or 10,000 ft).  All of these items are observed nightly, which is normal.  The siting of the mysterious lights were distinct and nothing like the other lights or items listed above.;39.6415326732674;-77.7260069306929
Orange and Blue lights seen moving away from each other rapidly.;2015-04-24 21:45:00;15 seconds;Orange and Blue lights seen moving away from each other rapidly. I was walking at night between buildings at my boarding school when I saw 2 non-flashing lights in the sky.  One was orange and one way blue.   They were hovering very close to one another and vapidly went different directions.  I could not see where the blue one when since a building was in the way.  The orange one did disappear as it was moving away very quickly.   They were very high up in the air and went from 0 mph to easily 600 mph in approx. ½ of a second.;39.6415326732674;-77.7260069306929
White ball with mist pause then flyoff at tremendous speed.;2018-10-23 20:32:00;3 seconds;White ball with mist pause then flyoff at tremendous speed. I was driving in Hagerstown, Maryland.  At the Lowes h Center on Wesel Blvd toward Burhans blvd.  A bright white dot appeared to come fron the top of the sky descending into my view approximatley 10 miles away.  The light was very white like halogen light bulbs on a luxury vehicles headlights  The light had a mist around it.  It paused at my 11oclock view for a mere second before descending at a rate of speed that is truly unexpalinable toward my 5 oclock.;39.6415326732674;-77.7260069306929
Distant light moving oddly in night sky above Hagerstown, MD;2021-02-08 20:45:00;20 minutes;Distant light moving oddly in night sky above Hagerstown, MD I was sitting on my exterior deck and stargazing after nightfall, and began focusing on a particular section of the sky directly above my home. I began to notice what appeared to be a brighter-than-average white star at first begin to make short, halting movements. At first I assumed that I was seeing a satellite of some kind, but the light's movements seemed strange after continued viewing. The star-like spot of light would move from left to right, halt, then move downward from its position, halt again, and then appear to move towards another random position, or return to a previous position. It never moved across any considerable distance, and seemed to be making these movements within the same small grid-like area. As this was directly above my sitting position, I have no idea what altitude this light was at. I observed this movement for at least twenty minutes before returning inside, including the use of standard binoculars I observed the same movement! s through that equipment as well, but was unable to make out any additional detail. I opted not to attempt to take photo or video via my phone due to the distance, inability to include any on-the-ground reference points, and poor resolution of my phone.;39.6415326732674;-77.7260069306929
