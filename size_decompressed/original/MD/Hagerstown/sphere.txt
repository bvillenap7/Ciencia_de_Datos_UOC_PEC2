Red-Orange Orb Sighting in Hagerstown Maryland, USA on 03/18/2012;2012-03-18 21:50:00;65-70 seconds;Red-Orange Orb Sighting in Hagerstown Maryland, USA on 03/18/2012 At approximately 21:50 EST I was sitting in my back yard in Hagerstown, MD.  I sensed something moving in the air towards the front left dark night sky.  I glanced up (due south) and immediately saw a reddish-orange circular orb like object, with a lesser intense aura encompassing the object, traveling in a straight line across the sky from south to north. It was similar to mars in color, however, was much larger (about 4x) to the naked eye.  It traveled overhead at an incredible speed, much faster than a jet. I could see actual commercial jets flying around in the sky, and it was nothing like them. It was not any satellite I know of.  There were no observable blinking lights, and no shape, other than what I can only describe as an “orb”. It moved very smoothly.  I was able to video it on my iPhone for 58 seconds before it was completely out of the line of sight.  It had absolutely no sound at all.  It remained the same color and brightness, and almost the exact same size during the entire time I witnessed this object.   I am an amateur astronomer, and have never seen anything like this, ever!;39.6415326732674;-77.7260069306929
Red, green and orange lights flickering around the object which hovered at least 20 minutes and then slowly moved north.;2014-09-13 22:00:00;1.5 hours;Red, green and orange lights flickering around the object which hovered at least 20 minutes and then slowly moved north. We observed a sphere shaped object hovering in the sky, it had red, orange, and green lights flickering the whole way around the sphere.  It stayed in one place for at least 20 minutes and then slowly moved north. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the object might have been a twinkling star, but we cannot be certain.

Four white spheres going in methodical patterns over north Hagerstown, MD.  ((NUFORC Note:  Advertising lights?  PD));2014-11-26 23:29:00;ongoing;Four white spheres going in methodical patterns over north Hagerstown, MD. 4 (four) hazy white lights, circling rather quickly in a circle, then each one goes into the middle and starts the process again sometimes going to the center and then back out to their respective spots, then starts circling, going into middle and back out.   What is odd to us is that there are no beams (as you might see if there's an event somewhere) going from the ground to the sky...just the white hazy circles continuing this pattern in north end of Hagerstown, MD.

Glowing orange sphere seen by 2 of us headed from north to south in Hagerstown, MD;2015-07-16 22:10:00;2 minutes;Glowing orange sphere seen by 2 of us headed from north to south in Hagerstown, MD. This evening, at approximately 22:10, my wife noticed an orange sphere very slowly moving over the house from our backyard.  She called me out to take a look.  ' The object was a glowing orange (not like a Chinese lantern as I have seen those).  The object had no blinking to it.  As for size, we would say it was maybe 8-10 times the size of a star to the naked eye.  The object was moving from north to south as we were facing southeast.   It only lasted approximately two minutes total in view and simply faded out of sight and we lost sight of it.  We moved to the front of the home to see if we could find it again to no avail.   We waited 15 minutes or so and kept looking for it to reappear although it never did.  This was something neither of us had ever seen.   My wife is a 46 year old housewife and I’m a 50 year old program director.  In all our years, THIS we couldn’t explain.;39.6415326732674;-77.7260069306929
