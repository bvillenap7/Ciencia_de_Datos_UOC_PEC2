Was not a plane was too close to be a plane I went out on my front porch to smoke a cigarette and talk to a family memeber, while we was talking we noticed in the sky a very bright red (almost like a plane on fire) circle going from east of the sky to the west not traveling very fast but was much closer than a plane...  It was the for a solid 2 minutes at least and then completely went away. I'm not sure what it was but it was very odd and I have never seen anything like it before, and while this was happening, there was no sound or smoke or anything no trail behind the object, but it did have sorta like a haze all around it.   It was completely by itself and looked almost like a air plane or something on fire but I know for sure it was not a plane...  This object was entirely too close, and was moving faster than I've ever seen a plane move in the sky.  It was rather big, too, about the size of a penny in you hold a penny in your hand up to the sky.   It was there, then gone..
