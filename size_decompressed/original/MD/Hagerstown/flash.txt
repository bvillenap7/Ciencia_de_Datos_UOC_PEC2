Every Saturday night my buddies and I make fruit cups and shoot the breeze, usually by 7:00 we'd be drunk, but the weather was bad the night before and my buddy O got his Honda stuck in mud and rocks.  We were outside jackling her up when out of no where three of us witnessed a giant green light so bright it litted up the entire sky green, turned white for a split second then changed direction and shot left.  It came straight from outer space like them movies in outerspace.  we were so winded up Os car is sat sunk in the mud until monday cuase we sat all night drinking laughing and shooting water balloons into the sky provoking them aliens to come back.  This is a true story.  Some people wrote ((name deleted)) mom rode a sheep into orbit, nope all five of us saw it shot away. ((NUFORC Note:  Despite the jocular, or less-than-serious, tone of this report, there were other reports from Maryland of a green fireball that was seen at this time, and on the indicated date.  Please see other reports.  Possible meteor, we believe, but it is impossible to be certain.  PD));39.6415326732674;-77.7260069306929
large white flash of light speeding across sky and disappeared within 3-5 seconds;2007-10-21 21:40:00;3-5 seconds;large white flash of light speeding across sky and disappeared within 3-5 seconds At approximately 9:40 PM on Sunday October 21, 2007, I was driving in my car heading West on Interstate 70 in Washington County, Maryland.   Just before the Smithsburg exit, I noticed what I first thought was a large airplane very low in the sky.  There was a bright flash of light, the object seemed to be illuminated from the center outward. It was travelling at an extraordinary speed straight across the sky and then it vanished as if behind a cloud but the sky was clear. It was only visable for about 3-5 seconds.  My friend, a passenger in the front seat, asked, Did you see that?  And we described the same thing to one another. Worth mentioning: about 1-2 minutes prior to the sighting my satellite radio lost it's signal and stayed out for about 2 minutes.  Right before the sighting the radio signal returned.;39.6415326732674;-77.7260069306929
