Oscillating craft with two parallel beams of lights that appeared to hover before gradually flying out of visual sight.;2016-04-03 10:20:00;0:30;Oscillating craft with two parallel beams of lights that appeared to hover before gradually flying out of visual sight. I am a pilot myself and fly out of the KHGR Regional all the time and have never seen anything like what I saw this morning.  These flat units of light remained stationary, but appeared to be oscillating at a low speed.  The object disappeared out of my line of visual sight as I contacted tower off the runway regarding any weather balloons in local airspace, but that turned back negative.

Four parentheses shaped lights in sky;2019-01-26 20:30:00;1-2 minutes;Four parentheses shaped lights in sky Saturday Night, January 26, 2019, at approximately 8:30 pm, I was getting ready to get in my car, and stopped for a moment to look at the night sky particularly the Orion Constellation.  There were some thin clouds in the area.  When I looked up to the left of the constellation, I noticed 4 (four) parentheses shaped lights in a vertical formation headed past the Hagerstown Outlet Mall north (moving parallel to South Potomac Street near the ACT gas station.)  There was no noise, or any other lights and I watched them disappear one by one. My first reaction was not quite believing what I was seeing feeling rooted to the spot then I became fearful and nauseous.  The sighting lasted 1-2 minutes (maybe less).   Once the lights disappeared, I got in my car and continued with my plans for the evening.  I felt a bit anxious about returning home.;39.6415326732674;-77.7260069306929
