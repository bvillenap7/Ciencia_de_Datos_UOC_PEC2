I saw it too!  RE: Football sized saucer over Hagerstown, MD in summer of 1974;1974-07-24 19:00:00;1-2 min;I saw it too!  RE: Football sized saucer over Hagerstown, MD in summer of 1974 While I was cleaning up the remains of an outside dinner I saw this craft that was HUGE, to a little kid, just hovering silently. My view of the craft was slightly obstructed by the house but I clearly remember it had different colored lights (red, blue, yellow) slowly revolving around its perimeter. I don't remember how long it stayed but I remember just staring at it for what seemed a long time and then it just sped away.  I've always wondered what it was and for the longest time just assumed it was something that was associated with the county fair. Then I read the account from another couple seeing the same thing. I lived approximately 6 miles from West Franklin Street, on Day Road.  Pretty amazing! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Football sized  saucer over Hagertown MD in summer of 1974;1974-07-24 22:00:00;5 mins;Football sized  saucer over Hagertown MD in summer of 1974 It was dark out, and my wife and I just got out of our car close to our apartment on West Franklin St. For some strange reason we both looked toward the downtown area in the sky. Above the square of Hagerstown was a craft that seemed to be about a football field long, and was hovering silently. My wife and I just kept looking at it without even saying anything for awhile. It had different colored lights slowly revolving around it's perimeter. We couldn't believe the size of it, plus the fact of no noise. Then we began to talk about it, watching it slowly begin to move to the west.All at once it sped up to an incredible speed and vanished. I went to the apt. and called Hagerstown Airport and asked if they picked up anything on radar,and they said no. We have kept quiet about this forever. Now we aren't exactly positive of the exact date that summer, since it has been such a long time, but we will remember this the rest of our lives. The reason I am doing this now is, we are wondering if anyone other than us had seen it. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));39.6415326732674;-77.7260069306929
Dark saucer shape object with dome coasting along 40 degree angle up from horizen moving west to east. .;2012-10-17 14:00:00;3-4 seconds;Dark sauser shape object with dome coasting along 40 degree angle up from horizen moving west to east. . About 2 pm i got a strange feeling to go out side and watch the sky. My back porch faces south of the city,  I saw what was a dark saucer shape craft with a dome about 30 to 40 degree angle up from the horizon, from my vantage point it looked to be about a 3/16 inch long compared to a ruler placed about 6 in. from my eyes, it was coasting along, i reached for my cell phone to take a pic. for the second i took my eyes off of it, gone.  Even with a pic. from my phone it would not of appeared to be more then a little tiny thing with few details in the sky.  This is the 3 rd. time in the last month at about the same place south of the city but with different shapes.  The others were at night, cannot give the time but one was just a bright flash at about 45 degrees lasted one second very large, second one was going horizontal from left to right (east to wast) it stated small and got larger with a trail behind it finished with just being a ball with a tail then gone!  that fast.   I believe half of what i see and little of what i hear. I am a skeptic not a naysayer.;39.6415326732674;-77.7260069306929
