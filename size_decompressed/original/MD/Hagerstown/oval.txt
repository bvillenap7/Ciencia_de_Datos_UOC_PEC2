Orange/gold ovular object seen hovering, then shut off lights the second another eye witness came within view.;2013-10-02 22:45:00;5 minutes;Orange/gold ovular object seen hovering, then shut off lights the second another eye witness came within view. On the evening of October 2, 2013, at approximately 10:45pm EST, before going to bed, I was walking past a picture sized window in my bedroom getting ready to turn off a dim overhead light.  From the corner of my eye I caught a glimpse of a bright orange/gold color light in the northeastern sky near South Mountain.   As I walked over to the window to get a better visual, the light/object moved across the sky slowly from the southeast to northwest direction, and appeared to get closer to my home.  The object finally came to a rest at what appeared to be 800-1000 feet off the ground, and perhaps 1/4 mile from my house.  (It was difficult to ascertain the actual distance)  After looking at the object, it appeared to have an ovular shape with a slight “top hat” look to it.  I watched the object for approximately 3-4 minutes before leaving the room and going to another room which was closer to the northeastern side of my home.   After watching the object for another minute or two, I called my wife to take a look at what I was seeing.  The very instant she turned her head to look in the objects direction, the object quickly “shut” from top to bottom almost like two doors sliding shut and meeting to close in the middle.  As it was shutting, the light grew dimmer till it was not visible.  However, I was still able to briefly see the outline of an ovular object. Upon the objects disappearance, there appeared to be two airplanes approaching from the southeast, with one of them splitting off heading southwest, and the other making a sharp turn directly to the north, heading towards the area of Blue Ridge Summit Pa.   I watched the airplane for a few minutes and notice it was circling the area at a high altitude, almost as though it was looking for something. For the record, this is the second occurrence I have seen a similar object in nearly the same location in the last 15-16 years, although I did not report the first sighting when it happened.;39.6415326732674;-77.7260069306929
Low and slow flying object with white lights and about 3 red lights on the front?;2015-10-22 20:30:00;8 minutes;Low and slow flying object with white lights and about 3 red lights on the front? On Thursday Oct. 22,2015 at around 8:15pm. I was mowing and saw a low flying object that had about 3 red lights and also white lights on the front ( it appeared round? ).  Flying over the South Mountain range from Smithsburg, MD, towards Hagerstown/Frederick area.  This is actually the second time I have seen a UFO in this area. The first time was about almost a year ago and I happened to see bright lights while I was driving and as I quickly looked up I saw it was hovering over a house ( very low in the sky).  I could not hear any noise from it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));39.6415326732674;-77.7260069306929
Green oval shaped object observed overhead while traveling on 70W just south of Hagerstown.;2016-03-02 19:30:00;~2 seconds;Green oval shaped object observed overhead while traveling on 70W just south of Hagerstown. Driving on 70W towards Hagerstown coming down South Mountain (located a few miles south of Hagerstown), observed an object oval in shape.  Object was green in color.  Object moved straight forward overhead in the same direction as I was moving along 70W.  Object took a little less than 2 seconds to fully cross the sky.  Size and distance from car couldn't be determined.  It was roughly the size of a quarter if I were to trace the shape through my front window.  No sound could be heard because my windows were closed and music was on.  Number of witnesses is unknown as there were several cars on the highway (20 or more) and I'm not sure who noticed the object.;39.6415326732674;-77.7260069306929
