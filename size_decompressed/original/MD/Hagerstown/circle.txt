Bright orange light with no sound.;2012-10-15 08:00:00;5 minutes;Bright orange light with no sound I was returning home and noticed the bright orange lights just above the tree line at my house.  They were moving slowly and there was no sound.  I jumped from my car and took a few pictures on my cell phone and then ran to a neighbors who also saw them.  He thought they must be hot air balloons but I knew they would not be out at this hour plus there was no sound at all.  I then went to my home where my 80 year old mother saw them before they were out of sight.  I have photos but have no idea how to send them.;39.6415326732674;-77.7260069306929
Witnessed a strange dark circle in the sky,during the daytime hours;2015-11-02 16:00:00;49 seconds;Witnessed a strange dark circle in the sky,during the daytime hours On, or about Nov. 2-5 2015 early in the evening 4pm -5pm I stepped out onto my back porch area. I glanced up when I saw some birds flying by, and something unusual caught my eye.  By definition it appeared to be a UFO.  It was flying, and it was some type of object I couldn’t identify.  I ran back into the apartment and grabbed my camera.  Not bothering to check the settings I put it on video mode and began recording. 	It appeared to be a perfect circle, and was completely black. It didn’t make any sound and was moving very slowly due north.  I was able to follow the object for about 49 seconds before it slowly drifted down and disappeared behind some trees.  I didn’t have any idea of what to do with the video.  Feeling that it would be ridiculed I kept it to myself. 	When I came across this site I decided that this would be a safe place to post it.  I always believed that UFO’s are real, but this is the first time I witnessed such an event.  I do not claim to know exactly what it is that I saw, but it is available for scrutiny, and perhaps someone can tell me what it is. 	The guess work on the date and time is due to the fact that perhaps after changing the batteries, I never checked to see if the date and time were correct and just continued using the camera. 	Background 		I am a 67 year old African-American male.  I have lived in Maryland for about 6 years.  Born and raised in New York, I have a B.A. from Fordham Univ. in New York.;39.6415326732674;-77.7260069306929
