Friday evening myself and my coworker were went outside Washington County Hospital to put our book bags in our cars because we were leaving work at 23:00.   As we were talking we both noticed a slow pulsating red light, about 3.5 miles south and Im not good at judging the height but it was maybe 100 feet higher then a cell phone tower. A few minutes pass and the light moved straight up and slowly started heading toward the hospital.  It was moving so slow that I asked Is is me, or is that light moving toward us?   She agreed with me and and it took about 5 minutes for the light to move 3.5 miles. Its movement was a constant speed and the light didn't change its speed of pulsations. I can't be sure how fast it was moving, but I can be sure it wasn't as fast as a helicopter.  The hospital is 8 stories and when it became directly over our heads we could tell it was maybe 50 or 60 more feet high. I was have never experienced something like this before.  I have been around air crafts all my life and it was not a helicopter or an airplane.  It was dead SILENT! We were so freaked out I think we both must have said to each other noone's going to believe us 100 times.  The object continued over the hospital and disapeared.  The whole time it was moving I concentrated on what was surrounding the light. Due to poor lighting however, I couldn't be sure shape or size.  I could only observe some black construction of an aircraft around the light. I also believe that what ever it was we saw had to be relitivly small.  I don't know what it was but I don't think it was military, because there are no military places in hagerstown, and it was too low and silent to be a helicopter.  Im puzzled.;39.6415326732674;-77.7260069306929

Driving down Broadfording RD, we saw a glowing blue ball of light approximately the size of a small bus cross the sky about 100 yards in front of us. It descended then moved forward quickly and disappeared.  We drove up and down the road around the spot we saw it and could not find anything.

Dark grey or brown, amorphous object, streaking west to east over Hagerstown.;2014-03-10 21:10:00;5 seconds;dark grey or brown, amorphous object, streaking west to east over Hagerstown. Had walked outside to my car, and noticed an object with an indistinct shape, travel west to east at a rapid rate.  The object was slightly lighter in color than the nighttime sky, but was still noticeable.  It was at an indeterminate altitude, but moved from where I noticed it (about straight above me ) to the horizon very quickly.  I would have thought it was a meteor, but there was no fireball. The weather was clear, and the moon was half full.  I noticed no airplanes in the sky at the time.  As a side note, I can regularly see airplanes in the distance headed towards Dulles airport (I assume). I heard no noise from the object, nor did I see any lights at all from it.  It is possible it did move erratically, but the indistinct outline of it, and the speed it was travelling made it hard to tell.;39.6415326732674;-77.7260069306929

Was on a trajectory be teen Funkstown and Meritus  hospital.  Was very low and lights seemed to be about 100 feet apart.  I pulled over and got out of car.  There was no sound and I could not see any shape.   I sighted it again from eastern Blvd in the area of the YMCA about ten minutes later heading northwest.   My girlfriend saw it in the vicinity of Hagerstown airport at about 1840 hours and lost sight.    No more than 100 feet altitude.;39.6415326732674;-77.7260069306929

I initially intended to check the outside temp on a thermometer attatched to my window screen.  It was 22Â° and very clear.  My attention was quickly diverted to the skyline above Greencastle pike.  Just above the tree line behind my house I noticed a very low flying object which basically looked liked a very bright ball of white light.  I couldn't make out any shape of the craft as the light was too bright.  It continued to fly very slowly in a southern direction towards Hagerstown's west end.  I just assumed it was a Cessna type plane flying low on a landing approach to the Hagerstown airport and I continued admiring the clear morning sky. As I'm scanning the sky and looking at what stars, I could see, I noticed two other passenger planes flying at different directions at a much higher altitude than the flying ball of bright light I first noticed.  Both of those planes displayed the blinking red lights that I'm familiar seeing. The sight of those higher flying planes made me realize that the plane that I thought was a Cessna wasn't displaying any red or blinking lights at all, just one massive light covering the entire craft.  I also realized that the ball of white light was actually flying towards the center of town, not to the airport as I originally thought because of it's low altitude and speed.  It was literally just ten or fifteen feet above the tree line that runs perpendicular to Greencastle pike and connects to the adjacent neighbourhood. When I gathered all my thoughts together and began to think that this thing may not be a private plane at all, I grabbed for my phone which was charging on the nightstand next to my bed with the intention to shoot some video.  As I raised the phone and fumbled with video mode and focus, the light disappeared as if someone turned off a light switch.  I didn't see a light trail that I would expect to see if the object had accelerated away at high speed, nor could I see a dark outline of an unlit object against the morning sky.  It's as if it were erassed with no trace of it ever being there in the first place. At this point I just froze in place. I didn't know how to feel or what to think. I was just numb trying to understand what in the world it was that I just witnessed.  Never in my 48 years have I seen anything in the sky that I couldn't explain. For the past few days in my spare time I've been driving around the area directly under where I observed the light trying to explain this off as something normal.  There are no high mountain roads for it to have been car headlights, and I believe the object behind the light was too big to be a civilian (toy) drone. This object was in my view for exactly 5 minutes.  It made no sound at all, never changed speed or color, and never diverted from its flight path before I lost sight of it.  As far as size is concerned, I'm guessing that it was equivalent to the size of a private Cessna style plane, but possible a little bigger.  The trees that I observed the object flying over are approximately 50-60 feet high, putting the height of the object in flight at about 75-100 feet. Lastly, I scanned the sky that Sunday morning in all directions until 7:20am, trying to relocate whatever it was that I witnessed.  I've also checked the same area of sky from 5:30am until 7am the following Monday and Tuesday mornings only to find nothing out of the ordinary.;39.6415326732674;-77.7260069306929
Strange lights, low in sky, hover and then move slowly away.;2018-02-06 05:00:00;15 minutes;Strange lights, low in sky, hover and then move slowly away. I live near Hagerstown Airport and I walk around my neighborhood at night and am up early in the morning.  I entered a date and time for this form but I see strange objects flying in the area often.  Usually I see a stationary light in the sky just above the tree line that looks like one set of lights that you'd see on a sports field.  It stays in one place for several minutes and then slowly starts to move across the sky, always quite low.  There is usually no sound, though sometimes I hear a very low wooshing sound.  I also hear prolonged wooshing noises late at night when I'm in bed.  They do not move away quickly, but seem to stay in the area for several minutes.  I look but see no lights or anything which surprises me because it sounds like something is hovering very low above the house.  My entire family have been woken up from these sounds before.  I assume these are maybe experimental aircraft since I'm less than a mile from the airport, and I know there are restricted areas there and lots of stories about stuff like this, particularly about the Sierra Nevada Corporation.  I should add that I only see and hear these strange things after dark, so maybe they want to keep things secret...;39.6415326732674;-77.7260069306929
