Standing at the front door of my workplace looking at a family of crows [mother feeding 2 young] on a light stanchion in the parking lot next door. Behind the crows, passed a 'dirty' white light. Light was cigar shaped and appeared to be some distance away [estimate 2-3 miles] at approx 20 degrees above the horizon. Weather was mostly clear with some low morning haze rapidly burning off. Light was first seen to the ESE and traveled noiselessly in a straight line at a constant altitude to the SW. As it traveled, the light seemed to elongate and contract slightly. Sun was at the wrong angle to be causing that much reflection. Light was 'dirty' or muted white not shiny as if relected off of metal. Without taking my eyes off the light, I shouted for a co-worker to come to the door. Before she arrived the light emitted [ejected a better word] a second object. Second object looked exactly like a star at night. Compared to the large light it was just a pinpoint of bright light. 2d object left the first to the rear or in the opposite direction from the flight path of large light. Small lights path was initially approx 45 degrees downward but arcing horizontally and flattening out before I lost sight of it in the treetops across the road. 2d objects rate of speed was very much greater than the large light's speed. Large light did not seem to pause or slow as it ejected 2d light. Co-worker arrived, I pointed out large light and she said What in the world is that Light shortly disappeared in the haze to the south southwest without ever changing direction or altitude. Hard to estimate size, speed or distance to light as there were no distinguishing features to judge scale. Guessing 2-3 miles distant at 5-10,000 feet altitude. At that distance, the size of the light would have been approx the same as an commercial passenger jet fuselage but had it been a jet I would have heard it at that distance. Very possible it could have been more distant thus larger, higher and faster. Estimate speed at 1000+ mph but this would be very dependent on actual distance from me to object. Would simply classify speed as rapid. I am 46, an ex-air defense artillery crewman [Vulcan] and have experience observing numerous aircraft types, in various light [reflective] conditions including military jets on afterburner or emitting IR decoy flares as well as satellites passing overhead. Light was not a short contrail. This was nothing like anything I have ever seen before.;39.6415326732674;-77.7260069306929
CIGAR SHAPED, MOVING SLOWLY ABOVE TREE LINE , BRIGHT OBJECT EMITTED FROM END, SHOT INTO SKY.;2001-08-01 07:00:00;2 minutes;CIGAR SHAPED, MOVING SLOWLY ABOVE TREE LINE , BRIGHT OBJECT EMITTED FROM END, SHOT INTO SKY. TWO OF MY EMPLOYEES WHERE CHANGING SHIFTS AT AROUND 7 AM, WHEN THE NIGHT AUDITOR SAW A CIGAR SHAPED OBJECT IN THE SKY, WHICH SEEMED TO BE ABOUT 5 MILES AWAY, OBJECT MOVED AT A VERY SLOW PACE JUST ABOVE THE TREE LINES, WHEN IT ALL OF A SUDDEN SHOT WHAT APPEARED TO BE A BRIGHT STAR OBJECT FROM ONE OF THE ENDS, AND FLEW UP INTO THE SKY AND OUT OF SIGHT. BOTH EMPLOYEES WHERE VERY STUNNED AND HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT EVER SINCE.;39.6415326732674;-77.7260069306929
