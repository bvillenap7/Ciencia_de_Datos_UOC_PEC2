I-81 south of Hagerstown MD, we saw what appeared to be a large, triangular object hovering just above the trees.;2003-12-03 20:00:00;60 seconds;I-81 south of Hagerstown MD, we saw what appeared to be a large, triangular object hovering just above the trees. My husband, 2 children and I were travelling down I-81 heading for a hotel in Winchester, VA.  I was driving and somewhere south of Hagerstown I noticed a formation of lights in a triangular shape hovering above the trees and buildings off to my left.  I tried to get my husband to look at the object(s) to see if he could determine what it was, but he said it was probably just a plane or helicopter.  I could not constantly look at the object as I was driving.  It then floated slowly over the road in front of us and off to the right of I-81S.  At this point in time I could vaguely make out a dark triangular shape of the craft as the area below it was very well lit and the craft was very low.  There were no strobe lights or blinking lights on the craft, only white lights that outlined what I assume to be the underside of the craft.  After passing to the right of the road for a few seconds, it crossed over I-81 once again at a very low altitude, then I lost sight of it as I continued down the road.  I know it was not a conventional airplane, as it hovered and was moving too slowly.  I thought it may be some kind of experimental military craft, but why would they be flying it so low (what seemed to be only a couple hundred feet above the ground) and in such a busy, populated area?  I would love to know if anyone else had witnessed this craft, or if anyone knows what it may have been.;39.6415326732674;-77.7260069306929
i thought i was seeing stuff at first;2008-01-17 02:04:00;5 mins;i thought i was seeing stuff at first I was sitting on my porch smoking a cigarette and looking up at the stars when i seen these two lights through the trees that kind of looked like a cars headlights and as it came closer i realized it wasnt a helicopter and it sure as heck wasnt an airplane,it was making a noise,but not like a helicopter or air plane would make, i only saw one and it was shaped like a triangle,it had two very bright lights in the front and then a light in the back that flashed all lights were white.;39.6415326732674;-77.7260069306929

Triangle shaped light low on horizon did not move for more than 30 minutes, but did flash intermittently.;2012-08-06 04:10:00;35 minutes;triangle shaped light low on horizon did not move for more than 30 minutes, but did flash intermittently around 4am two people witnessed a triangular shaped light above the Hagerstown, MD region  (witnesses were just west of Hagerstown looking eastward)  The light was fairly low to the horizon and the flash is what caught the attention of the two...the fact that the shape of the light was &quotdefinitely&quot triangle, changed in intensity from very bright to disappearing altogether intermittently, and did not appear to be moving sustained the attention.  The object did not move for about 30 minutes then blinked out and did not reappear.  A brief video of the light was captured via a cell phone...BUT, it is of such a poor quality, the value is questionable.;39.6415326732674;-77.7260069306929
Large pulsating triangular object seen hovering over town for at least an hour.;2012-09-12 04:00:00;1 hour;Large pulsating triangular object seen hovering over town for at least an hour. Two mornings in a row now I have seen a large craft/ unidentified flying object hovering above Hagerstown in the north eastern sky at approximately 4-4:30am. From my vantage point it appears to be somewhere above the fairgrounds or perhaps farther out of town. I have ruled out plane due to the fact that while observing it for an hour it barely moved.  Most fascinating is the spectacular light show this thing is giving off and is what first caught my attention. It pulsates with just about every color of the spectrum around the edges of the craft and the bottom portion looks as though it's erupting with fire. Last night the object was much closer and I was able to vaguely make out a shape that I can only describe as something out of battlestar galactica it appeared to be triangular, but not perfectly triangle. It's edges were rounded appearing almost like a boomer-ring! I was also able to hear a loud hum like noise emanating from the object even at a distance.  I awoke my Fiance the second night to verify what i was seeing and she was just as baffled and amazed as I. When trying to capture the object on video and picture the quality was very blurred so i quickly drew a quick concept of what I seen on a small white board I keep in my kitchen while it was fresh in my mind.;39.6415326732674;-77.7260069306929
