Pulsating very large, bright object sighted low in night sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Sirius??  PD));2015-03-11 22:00:00;20 minutes;Pulsating very large, bright object sighted low in night sky. Middle-aged social worker about to go to bed happened to look out window and saw very low large bright object in western sky, just west of Hagerstown Regional Airport.   At first, thought planet but way to low.  Got binoculars and observed for 15 minutes as object got smaller and disappeared.  Through binoculars object was triangular-shaped and appeared to pulsate.  Colors changed from gold to bright white/yellow with color at tips.   A small airplane flew directly below the object during my observation and must have seen it, too, as it passed.
