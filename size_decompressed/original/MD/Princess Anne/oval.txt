Bright orange disk with vertical stripes, or ribs.  Eastern Maryland.;1970-06-10 17:00:00;5 Min;Bright orange disk with vertical stripes, or ribs.  Eastern Maryland. I was about 12 years old, and I was going over to visit a friend.  I looked up and I noticed an object that was disk shaped, bright orange with dark orange vertical stripes (ribs ?).  It was moving very quickly, but I had a clear view for several minutes.  I did not hear anything, but I am sure it was not a normal airplane.  Comparatively speaking, it was a minor event, but it has always been a puzzlement to me. ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.  PD));38.1932;-75.7028
