Tiered Saucer UFO spotted in Derwood MD;2008-05-09 12:30:00;Few minutes;Tiered Saucer UFO spotted in Derwood MD It was a long time ago (a few years ago) and I was very young (somewhere between 3rd and 5th grade), but I remember it very distinctly.  Sadly, I don't remember the date or approximate time (this is because I am very bad at telling time.)   My family was driving along Redland Road, and when we past the local Bible Church, I saw something in the sky.  It was not moving, just seeming to float there motionlessly.  I'm unsure how far out it was, but it seemed like it was in front of the tree line. It was grey and metallic, very shiny and silvery.  It was tapered at the top and a bit at the bottom, think of a tiered cake combined with a typical flying saucer.  Closer towards the bottom, the main body of the UFO stopped, and there was a thinner ring of orange and possibly red lights?  I don't remember the exact colors, but I do remember there was a thinner ring that had orange lights that seemed to rotate, or at least flash at different colors to make it seem like it rotated.  According to my family members, I never mentioned it when I saw it, and none of them saw it, but I would attribute that to them being busy with other things while I enjoyed looking out the window.
