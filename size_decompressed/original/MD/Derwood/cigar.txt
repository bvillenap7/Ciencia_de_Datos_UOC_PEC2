Slow moving cigar shaped UFO with orange and red lights.;2015-07-23 20:00:00;5 minutes;Slow moving cigar shaped UFO with orange and red lights. I was leaving to go to a restaurant with my family and while walking up to the car.  I saw the UFO.  It was cigar shaped, grey, with red and orange lights.  It moved slower than a plane. I went into the car and my Dad asked what I was looking at.  I told him, and as an ex-pilot he could' not identify it.  We started driving and I saw it again, but I soon lost track of it. The UFO was silent I took pictures, but they are blurry and just look like a white dot.;39.1381;-77.1565
