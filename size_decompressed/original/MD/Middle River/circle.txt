Small ball of light streaks across sky and disappears.;2017-12-19 17:20:00;5 seconds;Small ball of light streaks across sky and disappears. I was waiting at a traffic light (with other people in their own cars) when a bright, white light streaked horizontally across the sky in front of me across Eastern Boulevard towards Martin's Airport.  It was not an airplane it was one small light.  I thought it was a meteorite at first.  It disappeared into thin air over the airport property after about 5 seconds.  It was low in the sky and not directly over any of the runways.  It did not make any audible noise.;39.3408;-76.4078
