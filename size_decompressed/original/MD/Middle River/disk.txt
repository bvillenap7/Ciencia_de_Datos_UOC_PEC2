I walked outside and noticed across the street, behind my neighbors house in the woods, was a disc shaped object surrounded by small red and yellow lights that were blinking consistently.  I thought maybe it was a tent when I saw it, but judging from the distance which was probably 100 meters or so, it was about 14 feet high from the ground.  At the base of it was a bright yellow light that stayed solid.  Above all there was this high pitched buzzing noise that I thought may have been discharge from a streetlight or something but this was the first time I had ever heard it outside.   I watched it for about 6 minutes, and went inside to grab a video recorder.  I came back outside and it was gone.  I wasn’t sure what to do so I waited there for about 5 more minutes, and it never reappeared, but I could still hear this high pitched buzzing noise. This is not fabricated, and I wasn’t hallucinating, I really did see this. I didn’t know what to ! do so I thought that I would report it on this database.  I was somewhat skeptical about UFO’s, but now I’m not so sure anymore on what to believe.  I’ll keep my eyes and ears open thought and if something else occurs, I’ll be sure to report it.;39.3408;-76.4078
