My car was parked in front of my house and the alarm randomly started going off.  I went out to move it to a parking lot across the street (thinking perhaps the sensor is getting confused and a fast moving car set it off.)   While coming back to my house, I stopped to admire the moon (it’s ALMOST full.)  As I was standing there, something to the bottom right of the moon zoomed a bit, left a small white-ish trail, pulsed/zoomed again and left a looooong, thin fire trail and was GONE.   The thin fire trail only lasted for a few seconds.  It was a muggy, cloudy night out there tonight.  No stars are visible, so I can’t believe it was a shooting star…. I have seen other strange things, but never reported them;39.3408;-76.4078
