Triangle shaped object with light, hovering over essex for 2 hours.  ((NUFORC Note:  Three planets in E sky??  PD));2012-08-23 04:30:00;2 hours;Triangle shaped object with light, hovering over essex for 2 hours A triangle shaped object with a star-like light about 1500ft above the ground.  At first I thought the object was a star until it came closer and moved slightly in all directions.  At some points there was a dim haze coming from the object.  From 4:30 until 6:30 the object moved closer and then further away.  I used stars as a reference point to make sure the object was moving. It was very stable horizontally but would move slightly side to side and up and down.   At 6:30 the object seemed to be beyond our atmosphere.;39.3974;-76.4495

There was a lightning storm to my right at the time (west) but clear skies to my left (east) where I'd spotted the object.   I assumed it was a toy because it was moving oddly, but it would have been fairly large as it seemed to be fairly distant from my location.  I showed the footage to a .mil friend of mine to see if it was a drone - but he responded in the negative.   Curious if anyone knows what it might have been - interesting experience regardless.;39.3974;-76.4495
