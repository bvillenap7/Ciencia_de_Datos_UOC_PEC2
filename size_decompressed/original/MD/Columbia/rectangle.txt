Large, low-flying, slow moving, silent black rectangle with no lights;1979-10-01 19:00:00;2 minutes;Large, low-flying, slow moving, silent black rectangle with no lights This has stuck with me for years.  I have always attributed the sighting to the prolific amount of DOD and NSA activities in the immediate area, but its still weird. I was walking to my friend's house after dark, and was rounding the NW end of Wilde Lake, where there's a walking path.  While walking up a slight incline behind some houses, I had an odd feeling of being watched, and instinctively looked up.   What I saw was a blank space in the sky. The night was crisp and clear, and many stars were visible.  There was a solid rectangle shape, black, with no lights, and completely silent, blocking everything behind it.  It was way too large to be an aircraft.  I stared at it for 30 seconds or so, it seemed to be almost imperceptibly drifting to the north.  I looked down to get my bearings, and when I looked back up, it was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));39.2074094972068;-76.8603351955306
We saw a lime green, rectangular shaped light shoot (stagger) across the sky in Columbia, MD on 2/23/02;2002-02-23 21:02:00;3 seconds;We saw a lime green, rectangular shaped light shoot (stagger) across the sky in Columbia, MD on 2/23/02 It was a green color.  It was the color that the flashing cursor on old computers used to be.  It was traveling east and it moved vertically in the sky.  It wasn't like it was moving gracefully, it was more like staggering as it went forward.  It was fairly low in the sky, but not low enough to see it's features.  It almost looked like that old video game blip. We are not crazy people.  At least I don't think we are. Thanks! ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor.  Please see other reports.  The two witnesses from Maryland are not crazy.  PD));39.2074094972068;-76.8603351955306
