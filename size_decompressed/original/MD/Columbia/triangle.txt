Triangle shaped structure with lining the perimeter.;2002-11-01 21:00:00;1 minute;Triangle shaped structure with lining the perimeter. In 2002, I had taken my dog outside for a walk.  I was standing on our lawn in the front of our house.  My body was facing East towards another row of townhomes in my development (the different rows of townhomes form a square.)  I had my head down because I was watching my dog but something caught my attention. I glanced up and I noticed lights directly above three of the townhomes in front of me (the homes are approximately 50 ft. away.)   I noticed there was a structure or formation to the lights.  The formation looked like the right wing of an airplane except the wing was very large.  I initially decided it was just a low flying airplane and I convinced myself that I couldn't see the rest of the plane because it was being obscured by trees. The lights appeared to be along the perimeter of the triangle or the wing.  From what I remember all of the lights were white.  I can't remember if any of them were flashing. As I watched this structure I realized there was no sound associated with it and that it was just hovering.  At some point it just seemed to disappear and I couldn't figure out where it went. I didn't know if the trees had just obscured my view and it was just a plane that had flown away or if the plane had really just disappeared.  I remember being perplexed and a little excited/weirded out. My gut told me I had just seen a UFO.  I ran inside and told my husband about what I had seen (my husband was not impressed.) I also drew a picture of the plane in case I had seen a UFO.  I then called the police (at the risk of sounding crazy) and asked them if there had been any reports of unusual aircraft sightings or UFO's in the area and I was told no.  I felt like an idiot after calling the police and decided I had probably just seen a plane.  However, after reading accounts from others on this site, I am now doubting whether or not this really was just a plane.  I really feel that what I saw was a UFO.  Am I going crazy? The best way to contact me is via e-mail.  Thank you! ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD));39.2074094972068;-76.8603351955306

They looked as though they were floating in the sky then began to move across the sky.  As we turned the corner it seems they just disappeared through the trees although that was strange as it is a very clear night outside.  We are near BWI airport but there isn't any way these were airplanes.  There were planes departing and arriving and these were not airplanes.;39.2074094972068;-76.8603351955306
Low-flying triangle in Columbia, Maryland.;2015-05-01 23:45:00;5 minutes;low flying triangle in Columbia Maryland While driving on Broken Land Pkwy I observed a large (est around 70ft from tip to tip) low flying(under 100ft) triangle shaped craft with multiple lights.  Upon seeing the object I turned off my radio, lowered my windows, and slowed down to see if I could hear anything, but there was no sound.;39.2074094972068;-76.8603351955306
