TWO FLYING ORBS IN A CHASE AT NIGHT;2003-10-26 23:00:00;Nighttime Walk-a-thon;TWO FLYING ORBS IN A CHASE AT NIGHT I and my friends were having a Nighttime Walk-A-Thon and us four were ahead of about nine others, and we had stopped to get a coffee at a little corner store and wait for the others to catch up. And we were just exiting the little store, when this giant glowing gold orb about as big as a Walmart crunched into a ball slid quickly through the sky, silent as anything, like it killed sound for a minute to get away in stealth, but the silence was so thudding, like bass on a radio, you could feel it in your stomach almost. It had little white port-holes (We couldn't tell what shape, they were so brightly shining.) and they were all across the ship in one big, thick, sideways Y shape. Anyway, the ship wasn't spinning or rotating, just speeding away. But it was strange, this thing was so bright but didn't light up the sky one bit. So then came the second UFO orb, red, and glaring. But this one wasn't quiet at all. It had the sound of a large, metal bowl, with broken lightbulbs scraping around inside. It was a noise that scratched the inside of our skulls like really gritty sandpaper. And this one was red like lava, with ripples, or two golden bands, one inside the other, all over it. This ship was the same size as the other one, or maybe bigger, and was speeding after it, like it was chasing it. After that ship passed, we waited for the others to come. When they did, they said they hadn't seen a thing but we all had the same kind of splitting headache which lasted through the next day. We told a bunch of people, some of the marathon guys believed us, and other people did too, but most of them thought it was just really late and we were seeing things, or that we just saw two large meteors. But the headache wasn't the only thing that lasted a while after the sighting, for us guys that saw it. The red UFO left a purple streak of light in our vision that lasted twice as long as the headache. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.
