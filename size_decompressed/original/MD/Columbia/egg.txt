((HOAX??))  While sitting in traffic, I noticed three specks in the sky.;2014-11-21 17:00:00;10-20min;I was sitting in traffic on 295 on my way to Hickory Ridge Road in Columbia, Maryland.  While sitting in traffic, I noticed three specs in the sky at first I could not tell that they were crafts you could tell that they were high out in the atmosphere because they were moving very slow two we're going downwards parallel with one trailing behind I looked to my right and I saw three more scattered but headed in the same direction as the three that I had just seen I looked up and I saw two more and I thought how can I be the only one seeing this. The did not leave a trail but you could see fumes/exhaust coming from the back of the craft.  I would describe them as appearing to be bulled shaped.  As traffic moved they went out of my view. I also saw a plane fly by and wished I could be a passenger to get a closer look. ((NUFORC Note:  We don't know whether this is intended as a serious-minded report.
