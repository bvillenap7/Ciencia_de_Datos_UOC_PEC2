Very bright orange colored light NNW of MD, USA.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Venus.  PD));2009-02-12 20:30:00;30 min;Very bright orange colored light NNW of MD, USA I was driving to my home in MD, there was a very bright light located NNW of where I am, is the first time I see a light like this, is very bright, at first I thought it was an airplane coming towards my location but a few seconds later I saw an actual airplane coming from the same direction but it looked smaller and not as bright as that light(I have a wide knowledge of airplanes),I thought it could be a star but looks a little too orange and I took a look at other big stars and none looks so big, I tried to take a picture but is very difficult to see the shape, and the light is still there, since it’s not moving I really don’t know what it can be, but the color, brightness and speed of it make it different to any other thing I have seen in the sky. I was trying to find if there’s any planets that can be seen now, or a satellite I found out the ISS is located south of the US at this moment, almost opposite of where this light is now.

Bright Green Light Shoots Across The Sky.;2013-11-02 22:30:00;2 seconds;Bright Green Light Shoots Across The Sky My husband and I were sitting on the couch in our living room which faces a window (ironically we were watching a documentary on the War of The Worlds radio broadcast.)  Through the window we both saw a very bright green light shoot across the sky.  We think it was a meteor.  Very pretty!;39.2074094972068;-76.8603351955306
Bright fast moving light that stopped and hovered.;2014-09-01 21:15:00;2 minutes;bright fast moving light that stopped and hovered. We (mother and son) were driving up Interstate 95 North bound when we saw a light shoot across the sky.  It moved at an incredible speed.   The light stopped and hovered for about two minutes.   Our view was then blocked by trees and we did not see it any longer. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Two small white lights very high in the sky moving in unison.;2018-07-16 09:00:00;10-15 seconds;Two small white lights very high in the sky moving in unison. At approximately 9:03 am, I was outside checking something on the side of our house near the roof.  As I was looking up, something in the sky caught my eye.  I noticed two small white lights very high in the sky.  One was directly above the other and they were moving in unison.  I didn't hear any noise or see any trails behind them.   After maybe 10 or 15 seconds they suddenly disappeared.  I thought maybe they went behind clouds (although it wasn't very cloudy.) I never saw them re-emerge.  I was thinking maybe they were airplanes flying very high in the sky?  I told my son about it this afternoon and he encouraged me to write in because he didn't think planes would fly that high in the sky (and so close together).   He also thinks I should have heard some sort of noise and that I should have seen a trail if they were airplanes.  There was definitely no sound and there were no trails left behind.;39.2074094972068;-76.8603351955306
