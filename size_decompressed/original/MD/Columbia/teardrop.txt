While returning from an evening out in Frederick, Maryland at 2:06 AM, traveling on MD 32 East between Exit 18 and Exit 17, directly in our line of sight about 2-4 miles ahead of our vehicle.  We saw a single large teardrop object that was luminous green at the base and white light trailing it.  It seemed to drop out of the sky and disappear as it would have hit the ground.  There was no secondary flash or sound associated with this event.   MD 32 South turns to the right from where we saw the object drop and we looked at the area to see if there was any activity in the area, there was none.  There was no other traffic in the area when we saw the event.;39.2074094972068;-76.8603351955306
