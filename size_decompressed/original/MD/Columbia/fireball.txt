I was driving home from work at approximately 9:30pm.  I was approaching a traffic light when something in the sky caught my attention.  I figured it was a plane but it was moving horizontally across the sky at a fast pace.  It was definately on fire and there was a smoke trail behind it.  I was concerned that it might have been a small plane that was on fire but then I realized it didn't make sense because it wasn't falling it was moving in a straight line across the sky.  It was hard for me to follow it because I was driving and I didn't want to cause an accident.  Nobody else on the road seemed to pay much attention to it.  Eventually it became obscured by some trees and I could not see it anymore. I did not hear any sound associated with whatever it was.  It never occured to me that it could have been a UFO until I stumbled across this site.  I had wanted to read more about the UFO sighting at O'Hare airport.  I am still not sure if what I saw was anything other than a shooting star or a comet.   I don't think it was a shooting star because this was at least the size of a golf ball maybe a little larger.  But I guess it could have been a comet?  I have never seen an actual comet before (except in pictures) so I have nothing to compare it to. I really wish that I had been able to watch whatever it was more closely but hindsite is 20/20 I guess. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
