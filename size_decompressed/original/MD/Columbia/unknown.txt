Small reflection moving at 45 degree angle.;2005-12-27 03:20:00;2 seconds;Small reflection moving at 45 degree angle. Not sure what this was, but for a couple of seconds, I saw something in the sky moving at a 45 degree angle. It was shiny. If I had to describe what I looked like, If you break off a small piece of lead from a number 2 pencil, that's what I saw. You know, that color. It was not lit up and saw it almost as if a reflection for a moment. What grabbed me instantly was the angle it was going. Pretty cool.;39.2074094972068;-76.8603351955306
Light solid blue semi-circle of light projecting onto bedroom floor.;2009-07-06 01:00:00;30 seconds;Light solid blue semi-circle of light projecting onto bedroom floor. On July 6, 2009, around 1:00am, I woke up to tend to my infant son in another room who was crying.  When I returned to my bedroom, there was a bright light solid blue light shining onto the carpet on the floor in my bedroom.  It was in the shape of a semi-circle.  It almost looked like a half of a spotlight shining on the floor. I am not good with measurements but I think the diameter was probably 8 inches long (maybe the size of the top half of a small personal pizza.) The light was still and did not move.  I did not hear any noise outside.  At first I thought maybe it was a car headlight.  Then I realized that this explanation was not possible since our bedroom backs up to a heavily wooded area and there are no cars around.  Our bedrooms are also on the second floor (we live in a townhome) and the blinds  were halfway down so there was no way a light could project into our room and shine onto the floor in the shape of a semi-circle. I began looking around to see if I could find the source of the light.  I could not see any blue light coming in through the window, but I decided to look out of the window anyway.  As I took a step forward, the light on the floor disappeared.   When I looked outside I did not see anything or hear anything.  I looked for planes and or helicopters that might have had search lights but I saw nothing in the sky.  The whole episode lasted approximately 30 seconds or less.  Today I called the non-emergency police number to see if there had been any other sightings of this light or if there had been any search helicopters in the area. I was told there were no other reportings of any lights but it was a possibility a helicopter was in the area.  However, the dispatcher was unable to confirm whether there was a helicopter in the area at that time.  I found the incident VERY unsettling! ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and she sounded to us to be quite sober minded.  She was shaken by the experience.  PD));39.2074094972068;-76.8603351955306

Looked like a bullet shooting down.  A silver bullet.  I looked around and saw 2 maybe three more coming down in a different angle but still down I tried to show on face time but could not see objects through phone.  Not a trail but it looked like ballpoint pin marks scratched on the sky accept ballpoint dot is at the bottom of the stroke and the stroke is going down.

White flying object high up in the sky traveling through in Columbia, MD.;2016-03-11 05:45:00;Not sure;White flying object high up in the sky traveling through in Columbia, MD I just got off work and was waiting on my ride and was laying down on a bench in front of my job.   While looking up in the sky, noticed a white flying object traveling through.  Bad eyesight, and was very high up, so was unable to make out the shape of the flying object.  No streams/smoke/trailings behind the flying object.  No lights, completely silent.;39.2074094972068;-76.8603351955306
Blinking white lights looked like rotating object in the night sky moved oddly and then stayed it the same place 5-10 minutes.;2019-08-10 20:45:00;20 minutes;Blinking white lights looked like rotating object in the night sky moved oddly and then stayed it the same place 5-10 minutes. Above the horizon level to the moon I could only see a row of white lights blinking in succession the way the lights were blinking it looked like object rotating, but there was no way to know for sure.   In the parking lot of Walmart in Columbia, looking south towards the 1/2 moon and Jupiter, I was in my car and watching the lights flash oddly.  About the size of regular stars.  Lived in this area 50 years so I know what helicopters, planes, and such look like taking off from BWI, National, Dulles etc but this was very different.  \ It moved to the right, then down slowly, and seemed to zig zag and flash intermittently.  Then it stayed still for several minutes while it kept spinning (or blinking lights in quick succession in a row).  I was going to go home but instead got out of the car and watched it.  The lights did not recede while it stood still for 5-10 minutes at least (same size).   Then it very slowly started to move straight downward in the sky.  I checked! my cell phone to see what it could be when I looked back it was gone.  I wanted to show someone else, but that Walmart parking lot is iffy and I wouldn't talk to anyone else there in the dark.;39.2074094972068;-76.8603351955306
