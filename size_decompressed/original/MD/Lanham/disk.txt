Saucer shaped, kind of a silhouette in front of the sun.  Could have been a bird, but it doesn't look wingy.  Clearly not a plane or blimp.  Possibly a blur of the camera with the sun.  But it definitely looks saucer-like.  Never actually saw it as I was simply holding up my phone/camera snapping pictures.
