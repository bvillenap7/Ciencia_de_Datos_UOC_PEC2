Parallel lines moving from West to East in the sky;2006-11-28 00:00:00;5minutes;Parallel lines moving from West to East in the sky On Nov. 28th I was awakened at EXACTLY midnight by our Donkey outside in the yard.   I looked out the window and into the sky to see white lights in the distace almost like fireworks thru the trees.  I noticed these lights moving from West to East thru the trees at a very slow pace.   I live in the pathway of the Baltimore Washington International airport so I have seen many planes in the sky. This certainly was not one of them.   As the object got a little closer and between the trees again I saw what appeared to be two parallel lines of BRIGHT white and green lights.   I did not hear the typical commercial airline noises.  I watched the object move from West to East at a very slow pace until it was out of my spectrum.;39.1901;-76.9659
