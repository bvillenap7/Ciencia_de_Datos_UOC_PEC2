Red/orange spheres flying across the sky and I have video;2021-04-09 23:00:00;3 minutes;Red/orange spheres flying across the sky and I have video About 2300 on 04/09/2021 me and my wife we outside smoking a cigarette.  We saw two spheres of reddish orange.  They traveled a speeed and motions that were unlike Aircraft. Very quick and sudden moves as they crosses the sky.  Not a sound either.   I have a video of the encounter as well.  What made it so clear for us to see was because they were below the clouds and that night we had dark clouds so they illuminated as they traveled across the sky;38.4534;-76.5084
