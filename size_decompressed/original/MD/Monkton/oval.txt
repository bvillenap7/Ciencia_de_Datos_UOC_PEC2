7-10 objects, Multicolored Lights, No Noise, Oval Shaped;2006-10-01 19:20:00;5-8 Minutes;7-10 objects, Multicolored Lights, No Noise, Oval Shaped The first thing I saw was an oval shaped object with several seperate multi-colored lights flashing in sequence around the sides of the object. The lights were Red or Orange, Blue, White, Yellow, and Green. The manner in which they flashed resembeled the rotator lights on most fire engines, not really a flash, but almost as if the light was spinning. The lights would also change position. They were lower to the ground then a plane would be. Low enough to be able to make out the outline of the object. As it was moving it started to decline slowly and went behind a tree. I waited for it to re-appear on the other side for about 2 minutes and it never re-appeared. When I turned around there were 7-8 other identical objects in other nearby areas of the sky. One of them also went behind a tree for about 2 seconds and did not come out the other side, instead it came out the same side it came in. Others, changed speed, although not drastically. I also did not notice any noise, it was almost completely silent. Relatives in Harford County also reported seeing a strange object in the sky about 30-40 minutes after my sighting.;39.5678;-76.6026
