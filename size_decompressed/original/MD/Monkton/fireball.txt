Green fireball to the North;2010-06-24 22:00:00;5 seconds;Green fireball to the North Sitting on the back porch smoking a cigarette, something caught my attention out of the corner of my eye.  I turned to view what I initially thought was a firework, but I was struck by the fact that it was moving diagonally (from right to left) down. Unlike a shooting star that streaks across the sky, this appeared to be a green fireball whose movement was more deliberate and the intensity of the light fluctuated. Full disclosure.   The object was not above the tree line, so I was viewing through a small cluster of trees and didnâ€™t get as good a view of it as I would have liked.
