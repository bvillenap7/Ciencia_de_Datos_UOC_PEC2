3 big red lights outside the Movie Theater;2002-08-03 21:30:00;5 sec.;3 big red lights outside the Movie Theater as i came out from the movies saturday night, as the people were pushing and shoving out the front doors, I happen to look up above the tree line in the parking lot and saw 3 bright RED lights with a little white light at each end. I just stood there with my mouth open, trying to see what it was.  I didn't have time to point to it...it changed into a little dim light and then disappeared.   Oh...by the way...the movie was Signs that I saw. Power of suggestion?  or did anyone else see this thing??
