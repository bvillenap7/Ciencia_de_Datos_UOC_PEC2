Formation of 8 to 10 lights seen by Mother and Daughter;2012-12-30 20:00:00;30 seconds;Formation of 8 to 10 lights seen by Mother and Daughter Getting out of my car along with my Daughter on the night of Dec.3012, 8:00 pm Eastern time, I looked up at the sky as i always do.  The sky was clear, night blue, and bright from the moon light with no clouds and  several stars. I noticed movement and turned my eyes toward it (slightly to my left), and could see dimly lit objects gliding across the sky going to the right of me.   I blinked my eyes several times to get a good focus before asking my Daughter who was to the right of me getting out from the passenger side to look at what I was looking at.  She confirmed to me she was seeing them too and we both asked each other what they were.   When discussing it we both agreed we were seeing dimly lit lights 8 to 10 of them, evenly spaced one next to the other, traveling together moving foreword in a straight line leaving the Virginia area and heading towards Waldorf.   Although they weren't moving extremely fast, after getting over the initial shock of it all, we couldn't unlock our phones fast enough to get a picture before they disappeared in the distance;38.8224;-76.9466000000001
