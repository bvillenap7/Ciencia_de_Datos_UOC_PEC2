Orange object cruises past home near Andrew's AFB.  ((anonymous report));2017-04-28 01:00:00;2 minutes;Orange object cruises past home near Andrew's AFB While sitting on my front porch talking with my nephew, I looked to the right of my porch overhand and saw a glowing orange object floating over the tree line.  It looked odd as if to paulsate.  I looked to see if there were any navigational lights and could see none.   I immediately called to my nephew to come see as the object cruzed past the house heeding northwest.  There is a military base near to my house, (Andrews Airforce Base).   As the object flew near that direction, the orange light went out and we could still see the the silliwet of the object which was now black without distinct form at the distance.  The object made no sound as it cruised by and eventually faded from sight.  My nephew thinks it was some new military technology.  I believe it was not of this world.  I have seen other objects such as see through cigar shape objects flying as low as street lights, making no sound at all with others there to witness this event also.  Many times they are fl! ying towards the military base and lights go out as they pass over it.   This event on the 28th of April, was the first time I've seen the orange ball.  At the time of this sighting, the sky's were clear and the object appeared to be within a few thousand feet from my house and approximately 5-6 hundred feet in the air.
