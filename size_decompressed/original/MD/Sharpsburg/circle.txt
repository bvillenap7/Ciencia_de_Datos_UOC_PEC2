On the third night, I finally decided to sit and observe.  The object changed colors several times rapidly, appeared to move in a slight circular hovering motion.  It did not dissepear!  it continued there until I eventually went inside and tried to sleep, which I could not becuase I had an incredibly anxious feeling all night and the next day.
