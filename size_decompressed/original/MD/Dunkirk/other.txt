Me and a friend viewed a craft.  We turned around to see it again and it had vanished.;1999-01-15 20:43:00;30 Sec.;Me and a friend viewed a craft.  We turned around to see it again and it had vanished. Coming up a hill (towards solomons, I believe it is southbound) immediately after the route 261 turnoff from route 4 me and a friend of mine saw a UFO flying approximately 100 to 300 feet off the ground.  It was shaped like a K with two lights (almost like searchlights)(these lights also gave off enough light to tell its shape though it was not an auro or haze around the ship caused by some other souce) at the top and bottom of the the vertical line of the K.  We decided to turn around and see it again.  This was no more than 20 to 40 seconds afterward.  Upon turning around this craft had vanished. We scanned the horizon in all directions  and could not find any sign of the craft.   Also within 1 minute of our sighting this craft there was an extremely bad automobile accident approximately 2 miles southbound(?? towards solomons) of our location.  One of the observers (namely me) has believed for sometime that there are such things as UFO's and aliens (not nescessarily related but maybe) and the other observer thought both ideas were ludicrous though now he does believe in UFO's and thinks aliens may exist. ****IF YOWOULD LIKE TO YOU MAY CONTACT ME FOR FURTHER INFO.

Orb seen hovering in sky, vanished within a few seconds.;2006-03-03 13:00:00;2 minutes;Orb seen hovering in sky, vanished within a few seconds. I was on my way up to a town (driving in my car) called Dunkirk earlier and I look up in the sky and see this round orb sitting there. From where I was it was small (if you were to hold up a match at arms length, it was the size of a matchhead) and not moving. But it was shiney because the sun was behind me and the orb in front of me.  So I'm like, hmm, maybe it's just a plane getting hit by the sun and didn't think much of it.  So I drive about 400-500 yards up this big hill that goes into the town. When I get into the town I look off to my left and I see four military planes in formation off to my left. These planes looked odd and they were hauling ass. I look back to my right (by this time the orb was behind me and to the right) and it was GONE ! In a matter of   30 seconds or so.  Then I look back at the planes and all four of them were turning around above me and headed back to I would guess Andrews Air Force Base in a hurry.  I was blown away. I didn't think it was a UFO at first, but I had my suspicions, now I know it was.   I found a picture of the plane and come to find out, they were Warthogs, here is a link of what the plane looked like:  http://www.altixsoft.com/airforce/screenshot3.jpg  Here is a picture of what the Orb looked like:  http://www.orbwar.com/light/orb-block-005b.jpg;38.7403;-76.6389
