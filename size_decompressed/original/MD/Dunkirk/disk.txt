Orbs of light floating in a disc pattern.  Red and green lights on a craft possible triangular.;2017-06-13 23:40:00;10 minutes;Orbs of light floating in a disc pattern .  Red and green lights on a craft possible triangular I first saw a large craft with green and red lights.  It seemed to float in place and then go straight upward.  It then moved further out to one side.  By the time I started videotaping, it was pretty far away and my phone didn't capture a good video.  I saw what seemed to look like more lights in the sky blinking in close proximity to the one I had been watching.   I went back inside to call my husband, who is a truck driver, to tell him and he said you just interrupted me,  I was trying to video tape this UFO looking thing hovering over an embassy building in East Brunswick New Jersey!  There's probably no way we saw the same thing but the timing was insane.   I then started to see more aircraft, which I thought were possibly military with the green and red lights.  They would go straight up into the sky and then move out over top the house. They made no noise.  When I was outside taping, however, I thought I heard a low humming noise.  I am not sure about the aircraft after the original sighting, but whatever I was seeing the first time had to been a UFO.  I was thinking maybe the craft that came after were miltary chasing the objects, since they went out of sight.   I was at my father's house visiting, and everyone in the house was sleeping, besides me, but my husband was seeing similar things and on the phone with me while I was watching part of it.   The next day I realized my phone had set timers for the same time 8:40 PM over and over.  There were at least 5 alarms set for the same day and there's no way I would have done that.;38.7403;-76.6389
