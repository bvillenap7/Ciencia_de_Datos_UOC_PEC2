They were pretty far away but it seemed as though they hovering above the freeway.  I was standing on a hill when i noticed them but i quickly decided to get a better view of it.  When i got to a better vantage point one of the lights had already disappeared.  The remaining lights hover in a triangle like formation.  One of the lights began to drift away from the rest, and soon that one disappeared.  The remaining to stayed there together for about 30 seconds before coming together and combining then splitting apart and suddenly vanishing.  They were like orange or amber colored one light was significantly brighter than the rest.  The thing that stood out to me the most was the large number of airplanes in the area it was six of them all in the sky at once its like they saw them too;39.24025;-76.69795
Moving star and strange man;2012-10-11 19:30:00;5 minutes;moving star and strange man Witnessed a bright star move in a meandering nonlinear path. It appeared to be surveying the land? The object moved freely and intellegently. I lost sight of it behind the treeline. When I moved around the tree it was gone.  Then, from the direction the star went, came a man walking up the street. He was very muscular, wore a backpack, had a shaved head.  Don't know how to explain it but I immediately associated the man with the star.  He looked at me, I raised my hand in acknowledgement.  He did not return my greeting and I then booked it home.;39.24025;-76.69795

Two yellow lights were flying over the Power line causing the street lines to flicker constantly for about 2-3 minutes.  At first I did not understand what was going on and continue to drive down the street and returned to my home.;39.24025;-76.69795
