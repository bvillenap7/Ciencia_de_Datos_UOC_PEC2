Bright light above Sugarloaf Mountain.;2016-10-23 06:30:00;2 minutes;Bright light above Sugarloaf Mountain. I was driving to work in the early morning and it was still dark.  On 85 in between Frederick and Dickerson, MD.  To the left is Sugarloaf Mountain.  I happened to notice what looked to be a really bright star right above the mountain.  I thought to myself,m Wow, how have I never noticed that star before?   As I drove for the next couple of minutes I was glancing back and forth between the bright light and the road.  I was trying to see if I could make out any movements or blinking lights to indicate that it was just a plane or a helicopter.  There was none.  The last time I glanced away at the road and looked back, it was just gone.;39.2126;-77.4199
