Last Friday when the power went out, I noticed two lights coming up from behind the bisects across the street.  The saw one flying low come over the street, over my house and to the back where there are many acres and farm land.  It would firecracker every 30 seconds or so in white light.  I also noticed zig-zag lines in movement fast but hovering. I ran in to grab my phone to take photos but the phone died even though I had just charged it.  The same thing happened this time when I tried to record. About ten mins later, six lights slowly emerged one by one in a uniform line and crossed over the Farm land.  It looked like a tent shape form was hanging from the light.  They just hovered over the land.  So I grabbed my flashlight and shined it at the lights.  One then started moving toward my house.  When I stopped shiner my flashlight the one retreated back in line with the others.  Then they just seemed to disappear one by one after 50 mins.;39.4331999999999;-76.6545999999999
