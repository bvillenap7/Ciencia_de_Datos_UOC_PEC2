A sphere appears in the sky, traveling south to north just maybe 50 feet above the trees these are large oak trees approximately 80 feet high.  The object appeared to be 30 to 35 feet in diameter, traveling very fast, and just vanished, after approximately 2 seconds. I was in shock, and had seen my niece was the same.  This is my description of the object.   A large sphere, the inside area is brilliant blue, circumference is a border of neon green, with gold rays streaming off the back, similar  to the crown of the statue of liberty.
