Very large surrounding area lite up. The larger light changed shaps as it fadded. On the night of 19 September 2009 I was in my front yard putting away some equipment that I had used earlier in the day. I just happen to look up in the sky at that time to see this very large white light that was surround by an even larger area that was all lit up. the light did not appear to be moving all, if it was moving it would have had to be upward but I do not it was moving. the longer I watched this object the smaller it appeared. as it fadded out it was as if you were moving a spot light, the center porition started to grow smaller and the shape changed from round to oval and then just disappeared altoghter. but bthe surrounding was still lite up for a shot period of time and then it too fadded away. reported to the local authories, They confimed three other reported sigtings that night.
