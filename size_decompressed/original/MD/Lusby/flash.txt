Went out on deck of house and noticed a light that would not move towards or away from me.  It would flicker yellow, red, & white.  It was very vivid for the first hour, but now appears to be slightly smaller and not showing all the color it had when first sighted.  Have never seen this type of light out here before.   I have seen several plants that appear to be flickering from gases released, but never this.  The colors were too vivid.;38.3642;-76.4378
