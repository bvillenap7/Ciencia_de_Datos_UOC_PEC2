Square lights above South Mountain in Boonsboro, MD at 21:45.;2007-04-29 21:45:00;2 minutes;Square lights above South Mountain in Boonsboro, MD at 21:45. This was located in the same spot as another UFO (as far as I know) the same day.   It looked like four dots in a squared postion close together.  They were very bright.   I do know of a military base in the area of the sighting.   I can't provide too much info because is went away shortly after I saw it.  It was fire colored.  By that I mean it was orange and flickering yellow and red.  It was directly above South Mountain.  The sky was dark and very slightly coudy.  The moon was shining bright.  It creeped me out as much as my rottweiler.;39.5521;-77.7005
