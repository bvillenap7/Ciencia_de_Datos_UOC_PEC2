I was driving to work on approximately 3/15/92 in the evening, when I thought I saw a private plane about to crash, it was a row of seven lights at tree level going at a slow speed.  This was a small valley I was driving on one side and the object was on the opposite side.   I rounded a corner to find that the object was now directly in front of me, over the road, and not moving.  I drove up to it and parked under it.  When I rolled down my window to get a good look I realized that their was total silence and no downdraft.   I watched it for several minutes then continued on to work ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));39.5521;-77.7005
