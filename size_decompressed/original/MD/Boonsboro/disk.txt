UFO observed near Boonsboro, MD in the evening.;2007-04-29 20:50:00;45 seconds to a minute;UFO observed near Boonsboro, MD in the evening. This happened at about the same spot as another ufo that i saw later this evening.  It was above South Mountain.  We were walking on Route 34 and directly in front of us, above the mtn, I noticed a silvery light-reflecting thing.  I told the others and we looked.  First we thought that it was a helicopter, then a small plane, then it stopped moving so we thought it was a helicopter again.  We got really creeped out when it turned and disapeared into the sky.  Not flying fast, just, disapeared!  We assumed it was a disk-shape object although we were at an extreme angle so it actually looked more like a small silvery line in the sky.  This object was EXTREMELY shiny!  We also started to think maybe a bird had a mirror or something crazy like that.;39.5521;-77.7005
