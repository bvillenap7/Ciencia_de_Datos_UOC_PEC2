Meteor, Comet, Craft breakup.    ((NUFORC Note:  Result of earlier missile launch.  PD));2004-08-31 21:00:00;35 minutes;Meteor, Comet, Craft breakup. Looked like bright light. Could have been a craft breaking up in the atmosphere. Did resemble a comet or meteor that had broken up in the atmosphere.  Just spread out over the sky and faded away over a 35 minute period. Was surrounded by approximately 6-7 C130 transport planes from Martinsburg WV. Coincidence?  They do fly around here a lot but not that many or during a sighting of an anomaly.
