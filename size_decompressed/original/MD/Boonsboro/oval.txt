A large ball of white pulsating light that seemed to change to an orange color was very low to the ground it seemed to be hovering and there was no sound what-so ever.  There were no visual obstructions and no wind.  After watching it for approx 5-6 min there were 2 smaller flashes of light that came from the bottom of it and then would disappear.  The object would hover for a little longer then it would vanish.   This ritual happend 3 times in the course of approx 40 min. Besides myself there were 2 other witnesses. There were various aircraft to be within the vicinity as well.;39.5521;-77.7005
