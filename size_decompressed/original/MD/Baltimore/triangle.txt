An extremely large black rectangle or triangle ufo floating at tree top level outside our house.;1984-09-01 19:00:00;15 minutes;An extremely large black rectangle or triangle ufo floating at tree top level outside our house. When I was a teenager, my parents and I were heading to the symphony when we saw an extremely large black rectangle or triangle ufo outside our house. The symphony started at 8pm.  My dad never wanted to be late so we left a little after 7pm to make sure we made it there in plenty of time.  Our house is on a small hill near the end of our block.  It was twilight to dark.  As we left the house and started walking down the front steps down to our car – we saw this black object floating just barely above the tree tops. It was enormous and hardly moving.  It spanned from one end of our block to the other end.  I don’t know how long our block is but the object was more than the length of our block and there are 6 three story colonial houses between our house and the end of the block and the object was long enough to cover them all.  It was wide covering houses on both sides of the street.  The object was also tall or thick (maybe one story or more thick) and not aerodynamic at all.  There is no way that should be flying.  It was so large that we could never see the far side of it.  We really only could ever see 2 sides of it so it could be a rectangle or a triangle. We walked down the steps and into the middle of our street and stood directly underneath it.  It was very close nearly touching the tree tops (large oak trees in our neighborhood).  It was a matte black and blocked out the sky from our view because it was so massive.  It had lights on the underside -some large, some small, but the lights were dull and not bright.  I can’t remember where the lights were but know some were different colors.  The side of the object had a window like opening which had dim lights. With an object flying so close, it should have been loud but this object didn’t make a sound but you could sort of feel it in your chest.  Even blimps make sounds but this object just didn’t make a sound. We stood directly underneath it for several minutes looking up and then it slowly drifted up the side street next to our house.  It went from moving straight ahead to moving at a 90 degree angle without turning.  We kept walking with it up the side street while it was directly overhead.  It was gliding so slowly that it was easy to keep walking with it. We could have kept walking with it but my dad said that he didn’t want to be late for the concert and we had to go.  In the end, we watched the object for about 15 minutes.  I didn’t want to go but we did.  When we got into the car, I asked my dad what it was and he said that he didn’t know and didn’t want us to talk about it ever again.  I tried to bring it up several times and he made it clear that we were to never discuss it.   Years went by without talking about it– when my dad was dying I asked him about it and he couldn’t remember it happened.  I thought maybe it was all in my mind so a few years after my dad died I asked my mom if she remembered and she did.  This made me both relieved and uneasy.  We’ve talked about it several times since then.  My father was a physician, my mother is a nurse.  I am a medical researcher. While I wasn’t afraid while we were watching the object (it was oddly peaceful), those moments seeing it have haunted me almost every day since.  I’ve been uneasy sleeping at my house since that initial night and have had to sleep with a light on only when I’m there.  Every time I felt the slightest low hum, I rushed to my bedroom window to see if it is there. I’ve since moved away but my mom still lives there.  I moved to a very large city and oddly I sleep better in this large city than at my childhood home. I can be contacted by an investigator if needed.

The 3 connected triangles in the Sky.;2002-08-06 18:16:00;6:24;The 3 connected triangles in the Sky It was a really clear beautiful day with absolutly no clouds in the sky.  Me and a friend where sitting in a room.  From the window I noticed a huge flash of light that resembled a lightening bolt.   My friend only saw the great flash.  It looked to me as if smoke came from the flash.  Then about 5 minutes later as we were trying to figure out what the hell we had seen we noticed what looked like 3 white triangles connected at the base tiliting high up in the sky and it looked like it was flipping on its own axis, was coming from where we had seen the flash of light.  It continued to travel across the sky until it appeared to look like a star and then it vanished.  This happened during the day time.   I never thought I would be one to witness such an event.

Silver dots in triangle shape at noon on Saturday;2007-01-23 12:00:00;1 minute;Silver dots in triangle shape at noon on Saturday I have no shades on my window, and often lay on my bed on Saturday morning, reading, thinking, fuming, laughing, etc... .   Well, I looked-up, and saw an object movie across the day-sky.   I thought, It looks odd.  I could only see three silver dots, in the shape of the sky as they moved at the speed of normal aircraft across the sky...maybe we make triangle shaped ships.   I could not see any body structure, just three dots.   Whitish-silver, but not glowing, metallic looking.  I could see the object, assume some light, but could not discount reflection...hologram?  It was windy, and it moved consistently, way high up. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Description: I am rewriting my previous report b/c it lacked clarity, but not due to misspelled words...due to my not proofing my own work until it goes out. Anyway, again, on Saturdays, I lay under unshaded windows, often until noon or so, after I go out for breakfast, thinking, reading, sleeping, fuming, laughing.   This Saturday, at around 12:00 PM, I looked up and saw three silver dots, smaller than the tips of my fingers moving in the shape of a triangle...less than a tenth the  size of the tips of my finger, that's how high-up it seemed...they moved across the sky at a normal rate of speed for a craft as high-up as this one.   I thought maybe the wind, which was kicking-up, had carried something skyward, so I watched until it went out of vision's range, but it wasn't an object kicked about by the wind...too regular...watched about a minute until it went out of view.   No solid object could I see, though upclose it might be solid, but just three dots.   Can't say it glowed...may have reflected...maybe holographic...maybe we have something new up in the sky these days.    Maybe it was how the sun hit, but it seems like the sun would have changed as it glistened across a metallic cover...not a light, but more of a reflection.  Whitish-silver.  Or, maybe, it was three very distant normal craft moving in perfect formation. I just don't know...they were close, though...if they measure less one tenth the tip of my finger, then the three together measured half, or less, than the tip.

Large, slow moving aircraft that appeared to be triangular with a bright glowing sphere at the top center, flew over Canton/Baltimore;2015-09-17 20:56:00;3 minutes;Large, slow moving aircraft that appeared to be triangular with a bright glowing sphere at the top center, flew over Canton/Baltimore City, MD, last night.  They were completely silent.  We watched as the slow moving aircraft moved north-east in a horizontal motion.   Out of no where, a second aircraft appeared where we saw the first one.  There were no clouds in the sky for the object to go behind.  The second aircraft moved just as slowly, and began to follow the first one until they were both out of view. There were 3 of us that witnessed these crafts.  We also live in a city where airplanes fly over all the time.  These were not airplanes.  We shot a video from our phone, but all it shows is two glowing dots.  The only value is to show how slowly they move, and the flickering glow of the sphere.;39.3092537267081;-76.6167068322983
In West Hampden. Swirling pulsing noise prompted me to look outside where I saw a large floating illuminated object by the tower/antenn;2016-01-29 22:45:00;5 minutes;In West Hampden.  Swirling pulsing noise prompted me to look outside where I saw a large floating illuminated object by the tower/antennae things over by TV Hill.  Extremely bright, white with red in center.  Like a mass of lights.  Blinked off VERY briefly twice over the course of one or two minutes until it slowly flew SE towards the city.  I then saw the triangular shape of these lights.  Lights clumped together, not spaced like a regular plane.;39.3092537267081;-76.6167068322983
Backwards flying, triangle, no sound ship 3 lights;2016-02-02 18:00:00;60 seconds;Backwards flying, triangle, no sound ship 3 lights. Coming home from work with son and daughter.  My daughter yelled, Mom, look!   As I got out of the car, both son and daughter was looking at the sky.  When I saw it I couldn't believe it.  Low slow flying backwards triangle shape craft.  3 lights in the shape of a triangle but close enough to see the shadow of the ship.   Absolutely no sound from the ship.;39.3092537267081;-76.6167068322983
3 distinct objs,  Solid white lights, in Triangle formation, traveling same speed.  At high alt. traveling NE above city.

Lights were slowly dimming, then disappeared.  I know the flight paths into and out of BWI, these did not fit anything that would have came from there.   Also, I am up every morning, same time.  NEVER seen these lights, or anything resembling them before. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));39.3092537267081;-76.6167068322983

The bright red lights appeared to be in triangular formations.  I could not distinguish if they were individual objects in formation or triangular objects with very bright red lights in each corner.   I stood watching for several minutes until they were gone.  I never witnessed any air craft with such intensely red bright lights that hovers silently in triangular formation before last evening.   A friend visited me about a hour later who said that he had witnessed the same objects;39.3092537267081;-76.6167068322983
