Large object that changed colors in night skies over Baltimore,Maryland.;2008-08-03 21:40:00;15 minutes;Large object that changed colors in night skies over Baltimore,Maryland. It was Sunday, August 3, 2008, at approximately 9:40 p.m. just outside the Baltimore City limits, when I saw in the eastern sky what I thought was a headlight of a plane coming towards me. It was the size of a large star but, as the object came closer overhead, it grew almost to the size of a full moon. It suddenly veered off towards the south and only a white tip, the size of a large star, was visible with the exception of a black rectangular shadow that seemed attached to the tip. There were small sparks/flames from the tip (like a firework}. It moved exceedingly rapidly.  It then vanished for a split second. Suddenly, in its place appeared a huge, clearly defined horizontal teardrop shaped object--with 2 extending tips on each end at the middle - that was a brilliant orange. This object was the size of at least two (2) full moons not including the tips. The object was not moving.  Just as suddenly this entire object turned beautiful neon green. The shape did not change nor did object move. Then, all of a sudden there appeared, at the top middle and middle rear part of the object, what appeared to be cartoon lightening streaks. In other words these streaks were jagged, had width but were very small in comparison (approximately 3 - 4 regular stars in length). They were gold in color. They did not move nor did they glow. They did not seem like rays and their shape was clearly defined. Just as suddenly the entire object completely disappeared without any trace. There was no noticeable sound at any time. This entire episode lasted approximately fifteen (15) minutes;39.3092537267081;-76.6167068322983

There were no sounds coming from the craft. A half moon neon bluish green shape was on the front of the craft. As it passed overhead you could see two brights lights on either side which could have been some sort of engine. It cleared the entire viewing span of the sky in less then 1 minute and appeared to be only a few hundred yards above the earth. I was not going to tell anyone this until I saw the same type of reports on this website. I can say for sure it was not a helicopter nor was it a plane. It was not like any aircraft I have yet to see.;39.3092537267081;-76.6167068322983
