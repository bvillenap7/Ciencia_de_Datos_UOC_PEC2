It turned blue to red to purple to yellow and then orange.Every time I would get a good shoot of it through my telescope, it would hide behind the tree line. Almost like it knew that I was observing it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness may have been observing a twinkling star, but that is only a guess.  If, in fact, it was moving, it was not a star.  PD));39.3092537267081;-76.6167068322983

It seemed stationary at first, then it started moving very slowly side to side...as I kept looking, I could see what first appeared to be an airplane coming in from the left, but when I looked at it closer there were a series of white and red lights that were flashing side to side - it was small from my angle, but I could still tell it wasn't a plane. It came in fairly near to the first bright light and stopped in mid air, then started getting brighter and brighter like someone was turning on a light switch. They both stayed stationary, and alternated between dimming and getting stronger. Then, out of nowhere, a light just flickered out of the darkness and appeared, creating a triangle - one that started moving slowly in formation, all of the lights together. Then it changed shape a bit as each light moved, and a couple of them flickered out...weirdly, though, the one bright light was still there (it never went away until the very end). For the next hour or so, more and more ships or whatever they were would come in...at one point, there were five of them, all really bright and at all different levels of the sky. These ships, again, looked like airplanes at first - but they would change direction, go directly vertical in the air, and also stop completely and become stationary. Many times, the lights would also descend below the trees so that I couldn't see them, making them too close to the earth to be a plane. Occasionally they would all go away and I would think that it was over...only to look back out a minute later and see another triangle. About an hour and a half into this, I went out to the hallway of my dorm and called 5 more people in, all of whom saw the same thing. So with me and my roommate, that makes 7 witnesses that I now know of, and I think they were going to! tell mo re people as well. The climax was near the end, when there were actually five lights that made a large V-formation, two on either arm near the top and one in the center. It very slowly rotated, and then the lights went out. This just stopped happening about five minutes ago...actually, wait - I just looked back out again and there are two more lights back in the sky, with the same pattern as before. Overall now, this has been going on for two hours.;39.3092537267081;-76.6167068322983

Object appeared to be an airplane with no blinking lights until it separated into 2 objects.  The two objects circled one another, gained speed and then disappeared into the sky.;39.3092537267081;-76.6167068322983

I kept my eye on it and it seemed to turn to its side when it revealed a sort of triangular shape with to harangue orbs under it. the two orbs were only visible when it turned to its side.  Once it turned facing you I guess it looked more round and would seem to go away really far and then come back really quick. it could have been getting smaller.  Then enlargening?   I have 3 videos from a distance.;39.3092537267081;-76.6167068322983

Object witnessed in the southwest sky of Baltimore. Bright light/orb miles away in the sky but remained stationary for 15-20 minutes. Object was very bright and pulsated at times. It also appeared to split in multiple objects, then collapse back into one object. After 20 minutes of not moving in the sky, the object disappeared. It didnâ€™t take off or fly away, the light/orb simply was gone.;39.3092537267081;-76.6167068322983
