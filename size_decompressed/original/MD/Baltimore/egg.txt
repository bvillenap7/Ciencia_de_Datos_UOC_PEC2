Ovoid object with blinking lights moving slowly over downtown Baltimore;2004-09-29 21:45:00;?;Ovoid object with blinking lights moving slowly over downtown Baltimore The object was large and white and smooth and had blinking lights.  It traveled in a clockwise circle over downtown Baltimore.  It moved very very slowly.  At first we thought it was a blimp, but it was so strange and quiet that we really couldn't tell what it was.  I saw it first, on my way to pick up some half and half from the local 7/11.  I went and got my roommate and had her come out to look at it, and when our other roommate came home from work we took her out to see it as well.  No one could say for sure what it was.  Observers are one Hopkins graduate, one current Hopkins undergraduate, and one young professional.  We watched it for a while, and it kept moving in its circle, so we came back to the house to check the news for any report of it.;39.3092537267081;-76.6167068322983
Stationary long objet with dome in middle.  Red/orange & blue lights kept shining with varying degrees of intensity.;2006-05-15 23:00:00;15+ Mins.;Stationary long objet with dome in middle.  Red/orange & blue lights kept shining with varying degrees of intensity. Saw colored lights in the sky over Baltimore from my home across the Chesapeake Bay in Queenstown, MD.  Looked through monocular and saw stationary object with orange/red and blue lights which kept increasing and decreasing in intensity.  At first it looked flat and long with a dome shape in the middle, and then as if it turned slighty on it's side it looked diamond shaped and these same colored lights outling it.  After about 15 minutes it started to fade, but don't know if it was because of clouds moving in around it.  After it seemed to disappear, just to the left of it I saw a flash of white light and didn't see it again.  If anyone else saw this or something similar, please email me at jane@vanity-fair-prints.com.  I would like confirmation that others have also seen this ufo.;39.3092537267081;-76.6167068322983
