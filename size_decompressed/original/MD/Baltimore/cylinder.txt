Two distant shapes going west;2005-09-02 18:30:00;30-60 seconds;Two distant shapes going west Two friends and I were sitting in my back yard looking at the sunset on friday, sept 2, 2005. I diverted my eyes momentarily and two objects in the southward sky had caught the glare of the sunset. That is how i know they were metallic. They were very far off, possibly far enough to be in orbit, moving quickly due west at a uniform pace. They looked higher than i had ever seen a plane, but lower than i had ever seen an artificial satellite. I noticed the one to the rear first, and whether it was perspective or size, the one in the lead appeared smaller, yet moving at the same pace and appearing to be the same (MAYBE) cylindrical shape. The male friend of mine suggested that it was the international space station. I do not know, but a similar report given several years ago convinced me to put one in myself.;39.3092537267081;-76.6167068322983
bright shiny silver cylinder shaped object  2 pm, irratic flying;2005-10-31 14:00:00;10 seconds;bright shiny silver cylinder shaped object  2 pm, irratic flying I was traviling home via car at 2p.m. traveling East on E. Northern Pkwy (zip code 21206).  This object was traveling in the sky from North to South.  Aberdeen Proving Grounds is North of here off I-95 and what I saw had to be alien something or a military testing something.  At first I thought it was a plane or a helicopter, but I saw no wings or top or side propellers. It was very shiny, like silver chrome.  I did a double take because it did not fly like an airplane or helicopter I have ever seen.  It had a flight pattern like a hummingbird does...I heard no sound (I had my car radio on). And it was like zip, zip gone.  I did not have to squint to see it but it was close enough to be rounded on the top and botton like a pipe that is placed horizontal;39.3092537267081;-76.6167068322983
