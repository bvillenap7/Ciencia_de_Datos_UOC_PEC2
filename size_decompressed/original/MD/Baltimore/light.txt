We had just had a terrible storm and at around 5:00 PM I looked out my back window to see the sky as it had turned beautiful colors and the clouds were magnificent.  All of a sudden, I noticed out of the clouds approximately 8-11 sphere's of lights traveling in a group at the same rate of speed.  Three or four more followed.  They were followed seconds later by two more sphere's of light.  During this time I yelled for my husband but by the time he looked out he saw nothing, it was over.;39.3092537267081;-76.6167068322983
Slashes of light in an oval shape off of I-895 in mid-spring.;2001-04-30 20:00:00;25 minutes;Slashes of light in an oval shape off of I-895 in mid-spring. My friend and I were drving on I-895 from Washington DC To Baltimore, Maryland on night in mid-spring.  My friend was the passenger and reported seeing something strange outside her window.  She said there were lights following us.  I thought perhaps it was a reflection from a near-by carnival or something, so, when I got the opportunity, I looked as to try and quell her uneasiness.  Then I saw it as well.  It was about 10-12 blue slashes of light in an oval shape.  Once again I thought it was an reflection of something, but when it followed us from half-way between DC and Baltimore to Baltimore, I knew it was no such thing.  I was driving about 75 mph and it kept pace with the car for quite a while.  It stopped follwing us once we passed some sort of military base.  I believe there is an Air Force base in Dundalk, Md, but I'm not sure. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));39.3092537267081;-76.6167068322983
2 light-shaped...things seen in Baltimore County one year ago, I report on it now;2002-01-05 23:00:00;10 minutes;2 light-shaped...things seen in Baltimore County one year ago, I report on it now I myself have never been much of a science fiction or fantasy believer. I always thought aliens, Loch Ness monster, and all that crap was just a bunch of lies used for us to explain the unexplainable. Well, my thoughts changed a little more than a year ago. I was in my father's home in Baltimore, about 11 o'clock at night. I was looking out the window as I always do at the street life, waiting for Saturday Night Live to come on at 11:30. I was the only one home at the time. As I was looking around, I saw a helicopter take off, very silent. It seemed much more silent than a normal helicopter...but, oh well. Anyway, as I tracked its movement I saw out in the dark of night two lights slowly making their way across the sky. I thought it was other helicopters, or planes, or anything like that. But then, the lights vanished. I looked again, and they were gone. The helicopter I saw before was making its way towards the area where the lights were, and it had turned it's search light on. Then, about...say...300 feet from where they appeared, the two lights came on again, but there was this haze around them, and they were heading away from the helicopter. But, they were going straight up in the sky. Then they went down, left, and finally went out again. I thought it was just some sort of light on the ground making this, but the helicopter was now flying as fast as it could towards the lights. I saw another helicopter off in the distance heading towards the lights, it was coming from the opposite direction of the first one. It also had its lights on. The two hazy lights returned quickly right near the second helicopter, then went away. Finally, I didn't see anything for a few minutes, but then as the helicopters were about to meet, two hazy lights that seemed to come from the ground shot up into the sky, and vanished. They looked like the two lights I had been watching.  I went to the police station the next day to ask what the helicopters were going after, but they said that no helicopters took off last night. I believe firmly to this day that what I witnessed was something, and something that someone didn't want to tell me about.  I also did receive about 5 calls within the next week, and when I picked up, the person on the other line hung up. On about the third call I heard someone talking to someone else when I picked up, but when I said Hello?, they hung up again.  Feel free to contact me through my email address.

No sound (although it looked too high for any sound to be detected.)When first seen, it was slightly above the tree-tops in the east of my position.

I was sitting at my computer on the third floor of my row house I noticed an aircraft flying in front of the window. This was odd because aircraft was flying low within the city. I looked out the window into the sky and saw three lights flickering in the sky. I got out my binoculars to see what the object was. It was hard to see because it was hovering and moving very quickly in and out of binocular view. The original aircraft was joined by two others who circled the orb's location for about 90 minutes. Another craft came into view quickly with three candlelight colored lights. It was chased off by the aircraft to the northwest ((NUFORC Note:  Date is flawed.  Hence, possible hoax.

Orange orb floating over Baltimore;2010-08-29 00:15:00;20 min;Orange orb floating over Baltimore An unexplained orange light was observed by over 15 to 20 patrons on the roof terrace of a nightclub in Baltimore, MD, at approximately 12:15 AM on Sunday, August 29, 2010. I first noticed an unusual glowing orange shape in the sky, perhaps a few thousand feet above the roof of the club, about 80 degrees above the horizon.  I then looked around to see if others had seen the object, and noticed that several other patrons were already staring skyward.  We began to ask each other if we were seeing the same thing, and if we had any idea what it was. My initial reaction was that I was seeing some sort of balloon suspended in the sky with a light shining on it.  However, I quickly realized that the light was being emitted from the object itself.  I felt very strange as I stared upwards in disbelief along with several others.  The orange orb appeared to be changing its shape.  Its movements during this time are hard to describe, but seemed to be pulsing. The nightclub featured many patrons with glow sticks and other flashing lights.  A DJ was playing electronic music from the roof terrace.  I began pointing at the object with two glow sticks to help others see what I was talking about.  At this time, it began to pull back further up into the sky.  The light became dimmer and it moved near what appeared to be a star in the sky, slightly to the west at about 60 degrees above the horizon. Over approximately the next twenty to thirty minutes, the orange glowing orb would generally move in a methodical fashion between several stars / planets in the night sky.  Sometimes it would move slowly and deliberately, while other times it would move in quick movements.  On one occasion, while pointing the light out to another individual, we watched as it slowly approached a star, and then made a semi-circle movement around the star, and then proceed in a straight line.  Based on my own amateur use of a night sky computer program, I believe that this star may have been Altair. I tried to take a picture of the object with my phone's camera. The object did not appear on the camera, however, an unexplained square orange shape appeared on one image, which I would be happy to provide if needed.  I did not see any square shapes with the naked eye. At least 15 to 20 patrons witnessed the same event over the course of approximately 20 to 30 minutes.  After I went to find others and return, patrons could no longer locate the object. The coordinates of the sighting location are 39.293' North, 76.611' West.

This is a nightly routine for me as I enjoy observing satellites and shooting stars.  Several civilian and military airports are in the region as well, so I understand the energy and the sound associated to these aircraft. So that is why I find what I have observed in the above mentioned evening very peculiar. So like I said, I was looking up at the stars facing west, nothing in the s.ky.  Not even any aircraft the neighbors cat sort of distracted me so I briefly looked away from the sky.  As I looked back up I noticed what I thought were headlights to a passenger jet (above 35,000 ft.)  Traveling south to north..  No sound associated to this craft what so ever.  Also moving extremely slow for any aircraft I have ever seen from t any era.  As I was thinking to myself how it was funny how I did not notice this craft approach the light suddenly dimmed to what looked like a satellite or a star for about ten seconds.. Then fading away into into the nights sky.;39.3092537267081;-76.6167068322983

Upon first sight they are indistinguishable from stars until prolonged observation reveals they are actually within our atmosphere and doing manuvers unlike any known commercial or military aircraft, such as up, down, left, right, making perfectly angled turns,and circles almost only when being looked at.  They remained in patterns that resembled triangles, straight lines and constellations.  Due to my area being close to BWI airport, many commercial aircraft come within close range of the objects but they fly higher than the objects.I have been observing them for a 3 day period between 10/16/16-10/19/16 right outside my home and neighborhood they return every night and I have seen them as far as in the randallstown area.

Binary lights dancing through the clouds in large crisscrossing circle.  ((anonymous report));2017-03-30 20:10:00;45 minutes;Binary lights dancing through the clouds in large crisscrossing circle While driving towards Baltimore, I watched multiple lights dancing through the clouds.  I told the other passengers in my car to look and they too watched the lights.  I thought they must be from the ground shining up in the clouds, as we were soon to enter the city,   As we passed through the city, the lights continued dancing through the clouds, but did not remain above any landmark on ground.  I looked for ground based lights shining upwards but found none.  As I continued to drive north through the city the lights remained in front & to the right and above my vehicle.  All the passengers in the car were watching the lights keenly and noted they appeared to be traveling with us. For several miles, traveling on city streets, and then on HWY 83 north through the city, the lights continued to dance above and to the right of my vehicle. 20 minutes after initially seeing the lights while driving, I parked on a hilltop to watch the lights. For an additional 25 minutes all occupants of my vehicle watched as the lights danced and pulsed brightly then faded, then getting bright again, all while dancing through the clouds.  We took a short video of the lights and several photos. The lights in total had a large circular shape, but the lights appeared to be moving in binary groupings. There were at least 20 individual lights, grouped into at least 10 pairings.  While parked the lights faded and the cloud appeared to grow dark grey in a large oval shape. The lights were very faint while I could see the grey outline.  It was getting late and the lights were distant and dimming and so we left the remarked sight to go to bed.

I was camping overnight during summer camp in tents.  I got out of my tent in the middle of the night to look at the stars, and noticed a brighter object near the horizon.  It looked just like a planet, but brighter, so I originally thought it was Venus, until it moved towards me quickly.  I thought it could have been a shooting star, until it sped at great speeds right over me, sometimes slowing down, in a zig-zag motion.   Then, when it was around 2/3 of the sky, I heard a VERY loud sonic boom, followed by an explainable sound.  It was like a plane, but higher pitched, mixed in with a siren.  It quickly disappeared in seconds.  Clearly, it was traveling at extreme speeds, and only about a few miles above the ground.  This happened around Baltimore.  I was surprised to notice that no one woke up.  My father had also experienced a very similar event many years ago, only the object was too far away to hear.;39.3092537267081;-76.6167068322983

Flashes of light over clear night sky;2020-02-29 19:30:00;<30 seconds;Flashes of light over clear night sky. I was walking my dog at 7:30 PM EST and saw 2 flashes of light in the sky.  One flash was to the NE of my location and another flash would have been SW of me.  The night sky was clear and you could see all the stars.  The first flash lasted about a second with no accompanying noise.  The second flash happened about 2-3 seconds later and I could see it over Orion and once again no noise.  The best way to describe the flashes would be like a flash of lighting (not a bolt).  My dog also reacted funny.  I don’t know if it was connected or not but as we we’re getting ready to go outside our neighbor’s dog, who is usually well behaved and quiet, was barking like crazy.  Yes, I live very close to BWI but this was definitely not a plane and there are no runway strobes located anywhere near me.  We have never experienced this before.;39.3092537267081;-76.6167068322983
Two White Lights Over Baltimore;2020-11-13 17:35:00;6 minutes;Two White Lights Over Baltimore At approximately 5:35 PM ET on Friday, November 13, there was a single bright white light in the sky, so bright it created a large ring in the thin cloud cover. The light and the ring dimmed slightly and then there were two bright lights, from my vantage point the second was just to the left and slightly above the first and may have been ejected from the initial single light. The lights were moving slowly in unison in a southwesterly direction. I was driving at the time so I got to a parking lot and exited my car, which took maybe two minutes from the initial sighting. I got out of the car and watched the two lights and noticed the second one was now a bit more dim and slightly further away from the original brighter light. The lights continued to move in a straight path with the distance increasing between them. I continued to watch for three or four minutes until I could no longer see the light that was ahead of the brighter one, which was now a pinpoint i! n the night sky. There were no other blinking lights or red or green aircraft lights associated with the two white lights. A few of my friends in different parts of Baltimore also witnessed them. I shot some video on my phone but there's not enough detail to really see what's going on.;39.3092537267081;-76.6167068322983
