Square and round UFO anomalies imaged over Baltimore Maryland;2009-02-09 18:14:00;3 minutes;Square and round UFO anomalies imaged over Baltimore Maryland While Taking pictures of a friend in Baltimore, directly by a Reservoir. I took several pictures..nothing flew by us at all, however in my pictures are square and round luminous objects.In one sample these abjects are together and moving, in the next image, the square object is stopped above us, and the round object is 100 feet above the center of the Reservoir. We both would have noticed if something had flown by? However there are other images at this location which show orange streaks of light flying above the buildings in the distance, orange like that encountered http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/065/S65053.html http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/065/S65048.html Forensically sampled in HD 1080 i using D700 Nikon.
