Long, transparent object moving sideways across sky.;2001-11-18 04:00:00;1 minute;Long, transparent object moving sideways across sky. We were lying on our backs watching the Leonids.  Saw a string of 10 - 15 tiny, faint lights.  An aura around the lights blended into one semi-transparent cigar shaped object.  Oriented vertically, it moved sideways across the sky.  (One person did not see the lights, only the shape.)  It did not fade or change shape, but it seemed soft/transparent, not solid.  It did not leave a trail.  Moved slowly and steadily, about the speed of a high-flying jet (as seen from the ground).  We noticed it when it was directly above, and watched it until it was obscured by the treeline.;39.3092537267081;-76.6167068322983

Clouds were moving, but objects were not. The photos were taken within seconds of each other and the pattern remained visible until other clouds covered them. Objects seemed to be translucent and all connected. Estimate the objects to be about a mile and a half in length.;39.3092537267081;-76.6167068322983
Rotating circular object with blinking lights hovers over I-95 in Maryland;2011-12-22 17:45:00;2 minutes;Rotating circular object with blinking lights hovers over I-95 in Maryland While driving I-95 North toward Baltimore Between 100 and 195 I witnessed an unidentified object flying over the interstate.  The interstate became very bright as this circular object moved slowly hovering over the vehicles.  It had bright white lights which were blinking with a few colored lights and was spinning in a circular motion heading south toward Elkridge/Jessup, MD.  It was so close that there was no doubt that it was an UFO. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));39.3092537267081;-76.6167068322983
Grey, hovering object.;2015-05-13 08:15:00;>3 months;Grey, Hovering object My friends (about 8 of us) and I attend a high school 15-20 minutes outside of Baltimore, Maryland, and have seen this Unidentified Object hovering above the city.   At first glance it looks like a plane going to BWI airport but it has not moved for 3 months at least.   It is a grey object with a haze around it and it appears to change form if you stare at it for a minute or more.;39.3092537267081;-76.6167068322983
