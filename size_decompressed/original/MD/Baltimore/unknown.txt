Sunlight in the dark.  ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch from Wallops Island, VA.  PD));2006-12-16 06:30:00;10 min;Sunlight in the dark I was driving home from a party with four friends the sat morning before christmas around 7a.m.  When one of my friends said is that a plane.  I was driving n look up n there was this lit object moving very fast in the most metaphysical ways.  Up down n back around.  It stopped in the sky in the clouds n got bright as the sun.  it was still dark out so it lit up the sky.  this was very frightening.  it looked like a black canopy with a hole cut in it with light on the other side. I thought it might b a nuke.  Then I saw two fighter jets fly toward it then it dissapeared.  The smoke trail it left was incredible. Figure eights, zig-zags, then at the top a perfect 3d cube.  None of our phones would work to take a pic.  Well bout five to nine fighter jets began flying straight up then down and all over all morning.  I was in seven 11 parkin lot n pointed them out to bystanders, who at the time were oblivious.  they were shocked at the site of the fighter jets.  I was so excited by the incident, that i called my dad to tell him of the events, n to c if he could see the jets.  I called my exgirlfriend who lives in philadelphia, n she said there were a bout 8 fighter jets in the sky up there, this was around 9a.m.  My dad called back and said there had been a newsflash of the reports.  The media said that the government shot off two missles off of an island off of virginia.  They made no mention of why, and made no other mention of it.  They blamed the smoke trail on the weather.  The smoke trail itself was incredible because it sat in the air for a good ten minutes.   i have met six other people than my friends that witnessed the same event.  The fighter jets were in the sky until dark.  My exgirlfriend told me that she saw on the news that they were saying they released a new fighter jet that day, explaining why they were in the sky.  Y did the government shoot off rockets for no reason, then have fighter jets go after it.  The hole the others from the ohare airport describe sounds similar to ! the ligh t n how it dissapeared.  It was the most amazing thing my eyes have seen.  They cant deny the truth forever. 1 ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous  provides only telephone number.

UFO Streaks Past the Moon;2008-03-21 21:41:00;2 seconds;UFO Streaks Past the Moon Tonight, I had mounted by Zakura astronomical binoculars on my tripod to watch the moon. It was partly cloudy, but the moon could be seen clearly for a few minutes every 10 minutes or so. I was watching the moon for maybe two minutes when I saw and oject zip by. If you can imagine the moon as a clock face, the object zipped from the 2PM position to the 11 o'clock position and out of view into the night sky. It was black...and left sort of a motion trail. It was too small to really get a visible on shape or size. I don't know if it was a UFO, but cannot think of anything else it could be given its trajectory path.;39.3092537267081;-76.6167068322983

I was coming home from bowling on a crystal clear quiet night when I witnessed a cluster of lights strobing in red,blue and white moving east of Brandon shores Power plant.I kept driving and pulled over to the entrance of my neighborhood when I saw another approaching directly from the west to east the same type of strobe lights appearing and reappearing in strange directions up and down across and then darting.There was absolutely no sound whatsoever.I have never seen anything with this signature and I always look at planes.It was dark I couldnt actually see the object itself.It almost seemed to be rolling and then twisting.I have never seen a ufo until now and hope my case is not considered invalid.The object appeared to be 10-20 thousand feet high in the air.;39.3092537267081;-76.6167068322983
Object in mid air with 3 distinct lights;2011-09-20 17:30:00;approx. 2 min.;Object in mid air with 3 distinct lights I was driving from the bank on Ritchie Highway in the Brooklyn area neighborhood near my home when I noticed a low flying object which I thought at the time was an airplane. However, as I proceeded up the highway, I noticed that the object had decended dramatically and was actually just above tree top level.  I though - what is wrong with this plane - why is it so low? Then, it stopped in mid air and just sat there. It was dark at the time - but it was not a helicopter. There were lights on what appeared to be the front, the middle and the back of whatever this was.There was also a haze or cloud like vapor around the object. No noise at all. There was no traffic coming in the opposite direction or behind me at the time. I had almost come to a complete stop looking at it. I then proceeded to drive and as I looked back - it was still there - not moving.;39.3092537267081;-76.6167068322983

Two very large objects reflecting the afternoon sunlight hanging just above the clouds in the sky west of Baltimore.;2015-10-16 15:00:00;30 minutes;Two very large objects reflecting the afternoon sunlight hanging just above the clouds in the sky west of Baltimore. It was the middle of the afternoon and I was driving eastward, when I glanced upwards to admire the beauty of the clouds which were lit up by the sun behind me.  That’s when I noticed the first object, which was hanging just above the clouds and gleaming in the sunlight far more brightly than they were.  It was also angular, which made it stand out from the clouds. 	I noticed the second object, just like the first, a little farther beyond it.  They appeared to be stationary.  The clouds passing beneath them, they’d reemerge in the same spot.  At one point a passenger jet passed below the clouds but still at some distance between me and the closer of these two objects, and then I realized how unbelievably large they must have been. 	They seemed to be taller than they were wide.  And as I traveled round them, turning to the north, I saw their shape from another angle.  What appeared at first to be a box with a triangular projection below it became something like a very large “X” shape, with the upper legs being much taller than the bottom ones.  Then, viewed from the north, the side facing the sun appeared to be curved, almost like a sphere with a smaller sphere projecting below it. 	They seemed to be hanging in the sky somewhere between White Marsh and the Aberdeen Proving Grounds northwest of Baltimore.  I was driving to New York, so eventually they were too far behind me to see anymore.;39.3092537267081;-76.6167068322983
