I am USAF retiree widow. Low flying military helicopter drew me to window which quickly disappeared over trees but then I saw a white 'v' shaped object high in the sky (and for hight must have been airliner size at least) headed south east.   It was peculiar in that I had never seen or heard of anything like this also there seemed to be no recognizable bulge or indication of where an engine might be and no visible markings.  It looked just like a flying printed capital V' off a poster.  Very plain, no embellishments. (Sketch enclosed.) It was daylight so saw no lights.  Husband deceased at time so no imput was persued.  Figured it might be experimental but it was not like the 'V' shaped, small craft flown by the black man/pilot that flies into Westminster, MD, municipal airport occasionally where I live now virtually beneath the flightline.

I had parked on the uppermost roof level of a parking deck, adjacent to Baltimore's city hall. After admiring the view of the lit up city hall dome to the north of me, i continued towards my car due north. I turned to my right, or the east, and saw a series of very dim lights in a chevron formation moving quickly to the south. The arrow shaped arrangement of lights meaned there were possibly 5 or 6 on each wingThese lights were very dim, and i could barely see them. However, they did continue to move in an erratic pattern to the south until i could not see them anymore. The boject made no sound, and the lights stayed relative to their original position on the craft. If it was not some type of spacecraft, I think it could have possibly been a kite, or possibly a flock of birds. Barring an optical illusion on my part, it could not have been much else.;39.3092537267081;-76.6167068322983
Chevron sighted off I-95 north of Baltimore MD.;2004-10-15 21:12:00;15 seconds;chevron sighted off I95 north of Baltimore MD While driving southbound on I95 (rate of speed around 65 mph) about 10-15 minutes north of Baltimore I spotted on the left hand field of vision a formation of white lights in a chevron shape. the lights were bright but not exceptionally brilliant. From my vantage point in the drivers seat, the lights were approx 30 to 40 degrees above horizontal. They initially were above the tree line. It was a CLEAR and UNMISTAKEABLE formation of lights in a chevron pattern. I believe that there were four lights on each leg of the chevron. I judged the apparent size as subtending an angle approximate to the width of 3 fingers held together at arms length. After approx 15 seconds the chevron was blocked by roadside treeline and I lost sight of it. My recollection is that I noticed at the same time airplane lights in the same area of the sky.;39.3092537267081;-76.6167068322983
3 luminous chevron-like objects silently cruising.;2006-02-24 19:30:00;5 - 10 minutes;3 luminous chevron-like objects silently cruising. We saw 3 V-shaped objects flying SE, though they could have been triangular. They were silent, and their distance and dimensions couldn't be determined, though they must have been quite large. They almost had a translucent appearance, though the front edge seemed luminous (almost as if hazy, glowing lights or a string of stars had been strung across the front). Each object remained visible for 5 to 10 seconds.  We saw the first one at about 7:30pm then walked to a less illuminated area for better viewing. About five minutes later two more objects appeared and flew in the same direction.;39.3092537267081;-76.6167068322983
Huge black aircraft with green lights, moving incredibly low and slow over the trees.;2017-07-10 04:00:00;10 seconds;huge black aircraft with green lights, moving incredibly low and slow over the trees. Was driving on highway through Baltimore and a huge black chevron-like aircraft (the wings went against each other in about a 60 or 70 degree angle and were shaped like rectangles with one side slightly slanted).   Moving incredibly low and slow with a small bright green light on each wing.  I saw it come from the west (above the trees over the highway, and slowly make its way past the threes to the east.  I couldn't take my eyes off of it.   Never thought I'd see anything like this in my lifetime.  It was probably a hundred feet above the treetops.  And enormous.   I couldn't hear any sound being emitted from the UFO.;39.3092537267081;-76.6167068322983
