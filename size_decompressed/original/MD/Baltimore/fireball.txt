When looking north to the city of Baltimore, we saw a green fireball which seemed to change direction from a straight fall to a flat, then a straight fall again. We were traveling north on the Baltimore Washington Parkway last night at 9:40 (21:40) and were about to turn off onto Rt. 895 when we both noticed a green fireball falling from the south of Baltimore City.  It seemed to fall straight, then turn or flatten and fall straight again.  This is the second such fireball that we have seen in the past five years.  Although I didn't document it at the time, it was the same type of fireball.   We are very interested in teh crop circle phenomena and went to England in 1995 and managed to find several on our own.  We attend MUFON meetings occasionally in Cecil County, Maryland and I have attended state functions in the past.  My husband, a school psychologist is firmly rooted in scientific tradition, yet has come to believe that there are unexplained mysteries to explore!;39.3092537267081;-76.6167068322983
Multicolored fireball in west Balitmore City near the county line;2004-12-11 20:00:00;4 seconds;Multicolored fireball in west Balitmore City near the county line On December 11, 2004, at about 8:00pm, I saw what appeared to be a fireball (actually, it looked like a large flaming Christmas tree with multicolored lights and a tail) flying through the air, as my spouse and I were shopping at a strip mall on Security Boulevard, across from Fox Chevrolet, in west Baltimore City (near the city/county line).  It appeared for approximately 5 seconds, as I first glimpsed it out of the corner of my eye. It seemed to change direction and head toward the ground. At first I thought that it was a plane or helicopter ablaze, en route to crashing. It was very fleeting, and by the time I mentioned it to my spouse and she turned to see it, it vanished. We drove to where it appeared to have crashed/landed, but we found nothing.  When we got in, I checked the evening news on the telly and saw no report of anything related. I then got on-line and did a search. Fortunately, I came across this web-site, but no one had posted anything related at that time.  It very well could have been a meteor, though I did a search for comets and meteors on-line and didn't find anything that really resembled what I saw.;39.3092537267081;-76.6167068322983
9:24 PM I know it was because Gadget made it very clear we had to take one more walk in the park before bedtime.;2015-03-12 22:00:00;15-25 seconds;9:24 PM I know it was because Gadget made it very clear we had to take one more walk in the park before bedtime. Reluctantly I took him out the back and over to Patterson Park.  It was a crystal clear night, very pleasant weather and only 1 or 2 other dog walkers out.  As we rounded the Pagoda on the home leg of our walk I was looking south and could clearly see the constellation Orion just off to the SSW.  I remember saying to myself, So clear, I’ll bet I can see Taurus  (my Zodiacal sign).  Started to swing my head to the west and out of the corner of my eye, approaching from the south, I saw something I cannot explain. At least 9 amber/orange lights in formation and 3 or 4 more lights not in formation, meandering around the formation, were rapidly moving across the sky from almost due south to due north.  I was dumbfounded.  I observed this for about 15-20 seconds. The formation consisted of 3 v-shaped flights in a chevron that was rock solid, all flew in unison.  The meanderers seemed to circle and wander around the solid chevron as they tore across the sky at incredible speed. Flabbergasted, I muttered a few expletives.  Trying to get a grip on myself I struggled to get my phone out but just as it cleared my jacket pocket the phenomenon disappeared over the horizon to the north. I looked around to see if anyone else in the park saw this.  There was nobody around except Gadget who, sensing my astonishment, looked at me with concern as if to say, “What’s up with you, ((name deleteed))?  Why so frantic?”  Completely blown away we stood there for a few moments.  I Goggled the number and called in the report to UFOReports.com right there from the park. Bewildered we walked home and I made an online report of the sighting. I tried to explain it to myself most of the rest of the night. Was it reflections of street lights off my glasses?  Their color was similar to sodium vapor street lighting.  No I surmised.  I had to swivel my head from south to north to track the lights and they never wavered in their flight path.  Arrow straight the formation flew, no wavering or smearing you would expect if it was a reflection. Space junk?  Maybe, but the formation was so solid the flight appeared to be on an intentional course.  And to have 9 lights in solid formation and 3 or for in a seemingly random formation is a mix of trajectories and not likely to be a single object that broke up on reentry.  Such junk would all follow the same path and would leave a trail of some sort.  There was no flaming trail. Aircraft?  I've never seen anything move that fast in the atmosphere.  I've seen satellites, the ISS, Skylab, these moved just as fast if not faster across the sky.  The meandering lights also seemed to take a non-ballistic course and moved in ways no aircraft I know of could reproduce. So, there you have it. ((NUFORC Note:  The source of this report appeared on the Jeff Rense Radio Program on March 13, 2015, in order to describe his sighting.  He also submitted a report about his sighting in Tehran, Iran, in September 1976.  At the request of this witness, a colleague of his submitted a second report for that same sighting.  They both witnessed the same event, from different vantage points, in Tehran.  PD));39.3092537267081;-76.6167068322983
3 glowing fireball-type objects with trailing fireball, seen flying at dusk over east Baltimore, MD. ((anonymous report));2016-09-15 19:45:00;4 minutes;3 glowing fireball-type objects with trailing fireball, seen flying at dusk over east Baltimore, Maryland. My wife and I witnessed three glowing fireball-type objects coming very slowly out of the east (~ Middle River, MD).  From our perspective, each object had a slightly smaller fireball trailing slightly below the main object.  The lights remained steady (not blinking or flickering) and had the appearance of an orange-ish flame.  I did not have my distance glasses on, so a bit blurry for me.   The objects were travelling in a tight, linear formation. Seemed to be about several hundred yards distance between each.  As the lead object approached a thin, wispy cloud it seemed to dissipate.  The second and third dissipated as well before reaching the cloud.  After a minute or two a single object appeared in the same location (again, with a trailing object) and quickly disappeared.
