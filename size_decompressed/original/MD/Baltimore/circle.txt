Experiences worth reading;2005-01-01 00:00:00;not sure;Experiences worth reading Hello I just found this site and will be sure to add to my favorites.Im not good at wording my experience's, but I will do the best I can.  I recently have not scene a UFO but I have had experiences in the past worth wording. In the late 60's  Im thinking 1969 I would of been 8 standing in our front yard in Mt Washinton Maryland with my father,mother and next older brother we saw what looked like a cigar shaped balloon with what we thought was a person on a bicycle making a propeller move this craft.It was not too far away..less than a quarter mile,but we kind of had trouble making it out.It was not a plane and now I realize this was not a bicycle powered balloon either.Next years later age 13? I found myself outside my house in Towson Maryland in my underware at around 4am wondering why Im out here..I never have had a problem with sleep walking...nothing strang seemed like it had happened. Many years later 35 now I was living at a friends house in Mt washington Maryland ...my room in the basement I may have been abducted I cant tell if it was a dream or did it really happen? Im not sure but for some reason I keep recalling a very brite light like if head lights were shining in the sliding glass door in the room I was sleeping in. I think I came to in the backyard at the same time as seeing 2 dark saucers darting away over the tree tops.I went right back in and went to sleep but I felt like I had been through some trauma.It didnt seem like a big deal at that time but that dream or whatever it was keeps coming back to me.Sometime after that I developed an anal fissure which doctors thought were hemroids for the longest time...could this fissure be from a alien exam? Other strange things are the humming in my  right ear or right side of my head which started around 2/2000 that no doctor seems to have a anwser or solution for..it comes and goes and I havent had the humming for around a year now..maybe a few brief times since.Its more like an electrical hum from a large transformer.Lastly I have an obsession for ufo's and anwsers,I found out Im really good at algebra and math in general..I didnt even carry a notebook my last year of high school ..they wanted me gone..lol I was in the cop out program my last 2 yrs of high school.I did finish college with a degree in computer networking though 2002.I always have thoughts like I may have been programed or Im being monitored.If anyone else has simular experiences or you have some possible anwsers let me know. Thanks;39.3092537267081;-76.6167068322983
Circular white light flies over Baltimore on July 4th;2010-07-04 21:00:00;about a minute;Circular white light flies over Baltimore on July 4th On July 4th, at approx 9 pm, 9 of us were sitting on a porch on Eastern Ave across from Patterson Park waiting for the fireworks to start.  It wasn't completely dark yet and we were looking up because of fireworks and helicopters.  I saw a light above that was a circle shape, the light was white.  It was very high in the air, way too high to be a helicopter with a spot light on, and was definitely not a plane.  I don't know the exact direction, but it came from the inner harbor area, and went over Patterson Park.  I asked everyone to look up at the light and everyone agreed it was definitely not a helicopter due to how high it was.  It seemed to be in the height of where commercial planes fly, but it was definitely not a plane.  It was about a pen cap size, definitely bigger than a star or a planet you can see with your eyes.  It moved slowly, it didn't zig or zag, just in a slow fluid way.  Then, towards the end, it was hard to see as it was like it was shimmering out of sight.  You really had to look for it to find it towards the end, then it just disappeared.  It was a clear night with barely any clouds in the sky so it wasn't like it disappeared behind a cloud. The light, was very solid in the center, then it was like a very slight black ring, and more light, almost like a halo around the center light.  I hope that makes sense, I feel like I'm having a hard time explaining it;39.3092537267081;-76.6167068322983
UNBELIEVABLE!;2011-03-29 21:00:00;5 min;UNBELIEVABLE! Extremly bright light hovering with a distinct red laser for about 1 min.  Then red laser disappeared and the brightness of the craft dimmed and then brightening continously.   Was traveling at high speeds faster than any helicopter or airplane I ever saw.   Then vanished in thin air!!!;39.3092537267081;-76.6167068322983
Orange Objects In The Sky;2012-09-12 23:45:00;15 minutes;Orange Objects In The Sky On Tuesday, September 12, 2012 around 23:45, I noticed in the North East sky a bright object.  At first I thought it was a star.  But I noticed that it changed to a Bright Orange as it stood still.  Then 2 other Bright Orange Objects moved close to the first Bright Object.  Then 3 more of the same Bright Orange Objects came and formed a V-Shape.  When The V was completely formed, it moves just a little.  Then it formed a circle.  When the circle was completed, each object one at a time moved off into a different direction until it disappeared.  The last object to move was the very first one I saw. None of the objects made a noise.;39.3092537267081;-76.6167068322983

To the west another orb appeared and hung there in the sky stationary.  I pulled over to take a picture  as well.;39.3092537267081;-76.6167068322983

Came back out with two of them, triangle was gone, but small orange lights were moving up slowing from the east horizon.   First one would appear, travel slow and steady to the north, then a second would appear, where there first one originally appeared.   It slowly moved in the same line and toward the first.  Then a third orange light would appear, same way.   While this was happening, the first orange light would fade and disappear.  This same pattern repeated for about 10 -15 minutes.   There was no sound.  I assumed whatever it was was far away, don't know.   I did get my binoculars during all this, the lights looked like orange dots.  No other colors.  Very steady.

A bright moving white round object was caught on photos in downtown Baltimore.;2015-11-12 16:34:00;few minutes;A bright moving white round object was caught on photos in downtown Baltimore. I went to the top floor of the parking garage at UMB and took 8 pictures of beautiful sunset within 1 minute.  When I examined my photos, I found a bright white round object with pinkish ring was caught in my pictures.  The positions of this white object in these pictures are quite different, suggesting it was moving during the minute I took the pictures.;39.3092537267081;-76.6167068322983
Circle like object UFO moves and does dance in sky.;2017-10-01 12:00:00;45 minutes;Circle like object UFO moves and does dance in sky. I noticed it from my bedroom apartment building window, then I went up to the rooftop to see it as clearly as possible it ws extremely small from my vantage point but it ws like a star in the sky but it wasn't ... I look out this window every day and I am well aware of the positioning of the stars from my window ... at night but it was bright and beautiful weather and sunny... it started moving slowly then it would drift down slightly as if it were a balloon but it wasn't I am one HUNDRED Percent SURE !!! then it would drift up ward and stay put!!!! And I tryied to video and take pictures because people are so fickle nobody believes things of this sort but I wasn't seeing things that's for sure ... a plane would fly pass it and it would drift as if it was falling out of the ski then once the plane was pasted it would drift upwards as it it were going backwards in no particular direction but far off ... I did capture as much as I could I am still in awe of it I! had been waiting to see a UFO for as long as I can remember but looking upwards all the time isn't something a person in the city does that often if at all ... I wanted to share this because it intrepid and scary yet fascinating all at the same time;39.3092537267081;-76.6167068322983
