Globe of white light zooms directly at me while I look out my window at night. veers off and zooms away.;2008-08-20 23:45:00;3 seconds;Globe of white light zooms directly at me while I look out my window at night. veers off and zooms away. I was laying in my bedroom trying to get to sleep. There are large windows that extend across the entire south wall of my room.  I rolled over to face the south and look out the window.  About forty yards away, floating in my backyard, was a ball of light.  It was about the size of a large globe.  The light was a bright, pure, white.  Before I could hardly register what I was seeing, the light zoomed directly at me with incredible speed. Astonishingly, the globe was silent, and did not seem to disturb the night air.  For a split second I was face to face with this thing.  I jumped because I thought it was going to hit me.  Then it veered off quickly to the right and moved rapidly around the side of my house and was gone.  I tried to run into the other room to see if I could still see it, but I never saw it again.  This incident was the weirdest thing that's ever happened to me.  I did not believe in UFOs.  I sill don't know what to make of what I saw.  Must be either spiritual or extraterrestrial.;39.3092537267081;-76.6167068322983

Our alien ancestors are really starting to make there present felt.;2012-06-17 19:00:00;10 minutes;Our alien ancestors are really starting to make there present felt. June17, 2012, fathers day weekend down my moms house on the eastside of Baltimore having a good time, when my moms took a glance at the sky in observe something strange flying past an airplane  I took a look just as well did everybody else, scanning the sky with my own two eyes, seeing more than two dozen sphere shape objects cruising the skies.  Metallic colored crafts with the suns reflection shining off of some, amazing.  Some were in a cluster formation, others wre flying in sets of twos and threes, the remaining was just like roaming behind.  Most of the witnesses was saying wow you see what I'm seeing, remarkable. I have seen my fair share of U.F.O.'s in the recent past but not of that magnitude.  What was really on the back of that truck in Washington D.C?  makes you ponder.;39.3092537267081;-76.6167068322983
Two Orange Orbs flanked by four smaller ships.;2012-07-10 23:00:00;10 minutes;Two Orange Orbs flanked by four smaller ships. saw one orange orb heading  south west in the sky... and was flanked by four smaller ships, the smaller ships could have been planes or jets because I saw light on them but they moved in off ways which made me second guess myself on that, they flew so close to each other that they looked as if they went in and out of each other...... the orange orbs were just circles in the sky ... all the crafts were very high up in the sky... the four ships seemed to move in various directions... and when almost overhead... two of the smaller four ships took off in two different directions... one to the east and one to the west... the other two stayed close to the orange orb... then another orange orb appeared from out of nowhere about 200 yards from the other orange orb and this happened when they were directly overhead of me... and the two orbs and the two smaller ships continued to head south... the two smaller ships also did some strange maneuvers in the sky... flying ! very close to one another and seemed to blend into each other and then out...... the orange orbs disappeared after a little while... but I could still see the two smaller ships. the other odd thing is that all of the street lamps on our block have all gone out. There were no sounds or noises coming from the crafts in the sky and I was on the phone to a friend when I saw them.
