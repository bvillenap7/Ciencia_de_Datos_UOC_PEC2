Swirling mass of approximately 12 red to amber lights.;1999-03-19 19:15:00;1 minute;Swirling mass of approximately 12 red to amber lights. It was just after dusk and I was facing West when directly above me I saw a swirling mass of approximately 12 abmer colored lights.  They were slowly moving to the South at approx. 5-10 mph.  I could not identify a specific shape or size, but the lights seemed to move independently of each other.  The size of the lights were very small and circled one another in a counter clockwise direction.  It was a very clear night with no clouds in the sky.  I cannot estimate an altitude, however, I feel that they were fairly close to the ground less than 2000 feet?  There was no sound eminating from the objects. At first I thought it was a swarm of birds, yet these objects were illuminated and slowly disappeared from sight to the South.  It was very strange and I'm curious if others have observed this phenomenom.;39.3092537267081;-76.6167068322983
Hazey, swirling, lights.;2001-02-24 23:00:00;20 mins;Hazey, swirling, lights. We were at John's Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland. We were staying at a place called the childrens house. The designated smoking there was outside, while I was outside, I looked up, it was late in the evening, there were many lights were like hazey, but moved in a way, like rotating, like a square dancing kinda thing. I stood and watched for as long as I was smoking, and I went inside and mentioned it to someone, they didn't think anything of it, and I went back out, the lights were gone. Its been on my mind all this time, cause it was right over my head. We were there for another week, and every night I would look for them, and they didn't come back.;39.3092537267081;-76.6167068322983

Baltimore MD BWI a formation of more than 20 orange lights strung across the eastern horizon at a elevation of 35 degrees;2013-10-25 20:00:00;10 minutes;Baltimore MD BWI a formation of more than 20 orange lights strung across the eastern horizon at a elevation of 35 degrees From an overpass (Long Gate Pky) on Route 100 looking East in the direction of BWI Airport  approximately 35 degrees above the horizon and covering approximately 10% of the visible sky was a formation of orange points of light in a snaking arrangement beginning with a close cluster of around 10 lights low toward the horizon at the northern end then rising, falling and rising again in a curving string of lights ending with a dispersed group of 4 lights.  The formation hung suspended in the air.   I could not tell if the lights were moving away to the northeast, or fading from view.  I drove to a safer vantage point at a church parking lot on Rt 103 but fewer lights were visible and they were gone from view within another two minutes.  The last of the lights were those at the extreme right side of the formation, the lights to the east.  At first glance I thought I was looking a fireworks, but the formation covered to large an area and did not fall through the ! sky or move the way fireworks would and they remained visible for minutes not seconds the way fireworks would.  Best guess would be some sort of flares, but very unusual.  Also way too many lights to be simple air traffic.  I've lived here for the past 22 years and this was not air traffic.  Some such traffic was visible in the sky and the lights from those craft was much whiter.;39.3092537267081;-76.6167068322983
Flight of 9 to 12 amberish lights traveling south to north in a 3 chevron formation with wandering companions.;2015-03-12 21:30:00;30 seconds;Flight of 9 to 12 amberish lights traveling south to north in a 3 chevron formation with wandering companions. I am a Security Systems Sales Engineer.  I design surveillance, access, and intrusion detection systems.  I have been a security professional for 13 years.  Before that I had a number of experiences.  One of witch was being in Tehran in 1976.  This was totally different. Standing on Hempsted Hill, Patterson Park I was looking for Taurus on an unusually clear night.  As I found Orion and started to look north a flight of lights entered from my left. Three perfect chevrons of 3 lights each and some meandering, looping lights, maybe 3 or 4 just looked loose, unco-ordinated. I thought it might be some sort of reflection but off my glasses, but I had to swivel my head to watch, and they maintained a straight line of flight, as I observed them. Freaky, It's rare I see something that I cannot explain. Contact me anytime.
