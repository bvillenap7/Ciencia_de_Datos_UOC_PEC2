Three Cruise ship-shaped objects viewed on descent to BWI airport, Baltimore Maryland;2005-02-10 23:10:00;Unknown;Three Cruise ship-shaped objects viewed on descent to BWI airport, Baltimore Maryland While approaching BWI airport on flight 1515 Southwest Airlines I observed three objects, approximately 10 degrees above the skyline.  Two were parallel to each other, and the third was just a little below the two.  They were shaped similarly to vacation cruise ships, albeit much longer and more slender,  and   because of the perspective, must have in actuality been a lot larger, certainly much larger than the plane I was in.  Many other passengers were looking out the window, presumably at the objects, because on most flights I take, I don't see many people watching out the window during the landing.  No one commented on the objects.  At the time I thought I must have been seeing some weird reflection,  or some lit up building that was resting on a low mountain or hill but they really were too solid and distinct to have been some oddity of the light, and the Baltimore/D.C. area doesn't have mountains to say the least.  They were subtlely lit.  My mind totally tried to rationalize what I saw, because they weren't like any common aircraft at all.  When I first glanced at them I thought they were other planes coming in to land, but I soon realized that they were too long and far too large, only their distance made them seem momentarily comparable in size to our aircraft.  Only upon seeing an image of a reported UFO seen around 3am over Washington, D.C. on the Coast to Coast am site did I decide to make this report.  The objects I saw were very similar to that image, although I saw three of them and from further away.  So they looked more like huge, long cruise ships, and less like the lighted cigar-shaped object pictured on the main page of the website. www.coasttocoastam.com;39.3092537267081;-76.6167068322983

The star actually grew in size.  Initially, my first thought was it was a comment (sic.  Comet) that I was seeing coming in straight on so I couldn't see the tail when it got to what I would say is double in size it just disappeared like somebody turned off the light.  So naturally, I was then staring at the sky and called my girlfriend to come to look but it was too late that's when I noticed what I first thought was two seagulls because they were a white silverish color and quiet.  After observing for 2 or 3 minutes they came in to focus and looked as to disc or could have been just round my view was from directly underneath.  They were at about 1000 feet and traveled very smoothly until they were out of site.  The whole event lasted about 10 min.  The disk was also witnessed by my girlfriend.   I and my girlfriend are in our 30's! and I would say we are the average well respected  working Americans. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
