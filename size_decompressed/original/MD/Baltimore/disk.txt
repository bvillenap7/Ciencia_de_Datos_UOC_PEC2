Multiple colored dome shaped UFO that sparkled.;1970-06-30 19:00:00;5 minutes;Multiple colored dome shaped UFO that sparkled. I believe it was back in 1970 that my brother and some of our neighbors saw a colorful flying object that had multiple colored lights around it and a sparkle effect to it...almost like a sparkler.  We could even here the sound coming from it.   It hovering above us and came close to some of the telephone poles.  It moved it such a peculiar way, sweeping back and forth in the sky.  We reported this to one of my neighbor's parents, but they concluded that it was just a weather balloon.   At that time I was very naive, but to this day I don't believe it could have been a weather balloon.  If anyone else has seen this during that time period please let me know.   I heard that someone from Chestnut Ridge, Pa, area had a similar experience. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));39.3092537267081;-76.6167068322983
Oct 1973 Baltimore, Md  Discw/dome/portholewindows/interiorLight.  Noiseless, hovering, close by, huge;1973-10-21 17:30:00;15 minutes;Oct 1973 Baltimore, Md  Discw/dome/portholewindows/interiorLight.  Noiseless, hovering, close by, huge Three of us in my car, while coming from work saw a bright white light shile turning onto Moravia Rd. heading towards Belair Rd.  At the crest of the hill where the cemetary begins we stopped the car, and two of us got out to look at a disc shaped with a dome (typical UFO) object hovering noiselessly over the cemetary.  The object had several porthole windows and the inside had a yellowish light which was spinning from left to right.  I bit my lip to focus on that specifically.  The object was about 300 ft. in the air and about 500 ft. away from us and dead silent.  Cars were whizzing by but they couldn't see is because is was dusk and looking ESEast made it hard to detect anything.We watched for 5 or 6 minutes and then it started to move towards the bay and outer harbor area, made a loop in the distance and disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness and found him to be quite credible.  He reports that he telephoned the Baltimore Police shortly after the sighting, and the female officer he spoke with reported that their department has received approximately 200 calls about the incident.  The wife of the witness also saw the object, and may submit a second report.  Also, the third witness, who now lives in California, may submit a report, as well.

Jupiter Two-like spacecraft, flew noiselessly, slowly just over the field in our backyard.;1973-10-21 18:30:00;8 minutes;Jupiter Two-like spacecraft, flew noiselessly, slowly just over the field in our backyard. My mother, my three oldest brothers, and I walked out of our house in the evening to drive to church to attend a Coffeehouse function (that’s what they were called).  It was evening and dark but not too late – I would venture to guess it was bet. 6:30 and 7:30pm.  We saw something that astonished us in the night sky.  Looking NW we saw a huge vessel that was not very high in the sky, over the field in the back of our house.  We lived on a court and there was a 3 or 4 acre field behind our house.  The UFO was about 500 feet up, moving very slowly toward the SE, noiselessly.  I have a very good picture in my mind of it – it largely resembled the typical UFO spacecraft, just like the “Jupiter Two” from the “Lost in Space” series.  On the bottom of the craft were large, lit panels.  We all remarked upon this – how amazing it was to see.  We knew instantly that what we were seeing was otherworldly.  It was so close, so large, and moving without sound.  After it departed, at a constant but slow speed, I don’t know why we didn’t just all go back inside and call the police.  I do remember that we went inside to tell my father what we had seen (he was home babysitting my little brother), but we then just proceeded to go on to church.  We all compared notes in the car ride to church, “Yep, it looked just like the Jupiter Two” we agreed.  At church we asked folks if they had seen it – only one or two people said they had heard there was some kind of large weather balloon in the area that was being tested.  This was no weather balloon.  It was directly over the field in our backyard.  I know what I saw.  I’d love to see it again sometime.  Hopefully I’ll have the presence of mind to videotape next time!  (I do not know the exact date of this event.  I thought the year had to be ’73 or ’74.  I just chose this date because I saw some other Baltimore entries.  Specifically we lived in the suburb of Pikesville, MD.)

Confirm sisters report.;1973-10-21 18:30:00;5 minutes;Confirm sisters report I am one of the brothers that my sister described in her report as being witness of Jupiter 2 looking ufo.   I was discussing this siting this evening with another brother who saw it and happened to come across my sisters report when looking for old ufo articles in baltimore.  Just wanted to confirm that as my sister described is exactly what i and brother recall and he believes he can narrow down the year after checking with parents.  I feel it is very similar to what other baltimore report saw.   I believe our parents called police and would have been one of those 200 calls that evening.  That night was clear and the saucer low and moved soundlessly and slowly.  You could make out the outter diameter outline as perfectly circular.  Not blimp shaped.  It had smaller diameter of a dozen or so lights on underside.  I remember thinking at the time how ironic that a ufo would look exactly like the underside of jupiter two of lost in space but i suppose the tv model is modelled after actual sitings.  This was early 70's suburban area.  No hot air balloon and no testing site for aircraft.  Never saw anything like it since even on tv shows showing debunked cases.

Slow moving round object in the sky, rotating slowly and heading north.;2018-08-21 15:00:00;3 minutes;Slow moving round object in the sky, rotating slowly and heading north. I was in my back-yard working in the yard, around 3pm on Friday Aug 24, 2018, when I heard a helicopter fly above, and looked up.  To the right of the helicopter (helicopter was heading west) I saw a round object moving slowly thru the sky heading north.  The helicopter didn’t appear to be chasing it, as it just flew by and kept going west (though quickly fell behind the house/tree line so I don’t know if it turned back towards the object while out of my view.)  Very rough guess, but comparing to the helicopter that was at about 1000 feet, it had to be comparable in size to the helicopter, maybe slightly bigger.  I live near an airport, and see helicopters a lot, this was just an average size common helicopter.  (local news and police take off from there, and it just looked like the standard news or police copter, nothing military).  This airport is a Maryland National Guard base as well though (in Middle River Maryland.)  The object was slowly moving to the north, while slowly rotating.  Would say approximately 1500 to 2000 feet in the sky.  It was circular in shape, but if you think of it as a burger, it was round with a small bite taken out of it.  As it rotated, the side without the “bite”, it was reflecting a lot of sunlight off the top of the object.  As it rotated the “bite” toward me, it was reflecting much less sunlight.  That was how I could really tell it was a spinning object, but indented on one side (i.e. the bite).  It seemed to make a full rotation every 10 to 15 seconds.  I could not take my eyes off of it, kept trying to rationalize what I was seeing.  After 2 or 3 mins, it finally dawned on me to pull out my phone and record some video.  With the bright sunny day, I was having a hard time seeing my phone’s screen.  By the time I adjusted the screen brightness, got my camera app open and looked up, it was gone.  With how slow it was moving, I would have expected it to still be there.  I’m so upset I did not take out my phone sooner.  It had to have moved quickly out of view, I would say it took me about 30 – 40 seconds to get my screen brightness adjusted, and get the camera app open, and look back up.  It could not have been a plane, it was moving far too slowly.  A plane would have fallen from the sky at that slow of speed.  I did not see any helicopter blades on top, no wings, nothing.  Just a round spinning object, indented on one side.  Feel free to email me at address I left in the report, I'll answer any other questions I can.;39.3092537267081;-76.6167068322983
