Large light traveling east to west, no sound, then flashed and instantly disappeared;2008-08-03 22:00:00;Approx 45 seconds;Large light traveling east to west, no sound, then flashed and instantly disappeared Unidentified object/light in sky  On Sunday night August 3 2008 between 10-10:30pm EST over a section of Baltimore City, Maryland I witnessed an extremely unusual event.  We often see and hear helicopters as we are in an urban area and just a few blocks from a major shock trauma center so there is much activity.  This night however as I sat on my deck I noticed to my left in the eastern sky what appeared to be a low helicopter heading west, the bright light on it however was larger than normal and was of a light green color which Iâ€™ve never seen in the three years of living here.  As it got closer to being overhead it appeared to be oval shaped and I realized there was absolutely NO NOISE, no engine sound, and no propeller sound.  All at once the light seemed to flash one time and go dark, completely dark, nothing, not a sound.  I mean it just went out as if someone had turned off a switch.  It was incredible.  And in the sky where the light had just been extinguished, there was nothing but clear sky. Can anybody give me any explanation for this?   Thank you.;39.3092537267081;-76.6167068322983

Three oval-shaped objects came together and flew in formation before separating and flying away.;2016-02-21 15:15:00;2.5 minutes;Three oval shaped objects came together and flew in formation before separating and flying away. Three brown oval shaped objects appeared in the distance from the 6th floor of Americas best value inn.  The objects were flying separately and then came together in a circular formation and started flying up, down and around in a circle. There were no lights or sounds.  After a minute of flying in formation, two objects flew straight up out of sight while the third remained for a couple of seconds before flying in the opposite direction.  About 15 minutes later two military helicopters came and circled the area for a couple minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
