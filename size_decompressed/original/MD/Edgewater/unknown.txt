However, there was no balloon visible.  Object moved at steady, linear pace, traveling horizontally across sky northward towards Annapolis Harbor Center.   There was no audible sound from object.  I was not able to view the object in my cell phone to capture a photo.;38.918;-76.5361
Bright, flashing multi colored lights coming from object traveling across the sky;2021-01-03 23:00:00;1 minute;Bright, flashing multi colored lights coming from object traveling across the sky On January 3, 2021, at approximately 11pm I went to my bedroom windows to close the drapes for the evening when I noticed an object, approximately 35 degrees above the horizon, traveling in a Northeasterly direction in a straight, level path across the sky.  This object was emitting bright, multiple-colored lights (white, amber, blue, red) in a very, very rapid sequence. Much faster than I’ve ever seen on a commercial, military or private aircraft. The object made no sound and due to the brilliant light it was emitting, I couldn’t determine its shape.  The sky that night was crystal clear. I viewed this object for about 60 to 75 seconds. During that time, I scanned other sections of the sky to see if there were other aircraft in the area and I saw none.  I live on the Mayo Peninsula in Maryland. Aircraft landing at BWI (Baltimore Washington International Airport) frequently travel over the peninsula on their approach. But not in the direction this object was traveling in.  I’m a US Marine Corps veteran and a retired law enforcement officer.;38.918;-76.5361
