Supposedly the space station was supposed to be crossing over but the first 2 lights that passed looked like orange balls following each other. The head light faded out slowly as they moved in perfect sequence. A minute after those two disappeared from view a massive triangle shaped 3 point light came from the horizon. We captured the video and my whole neighborhood saw it.  They went by slowly and again the front light faded and then all 3 of the eventually. About 30 minutes later we kept gazing and we saw individual lights zig zagging back and fourth. Also it looked like airplanes where chasing them and herding them up like cattle. Almost looked like a star wars battle in the sky with 15 to 20 smaller lights that moved at super fast speeds.;39.386;-76.54
Parkville, MD, ufo sighting.;2014-01-31 22:50:00;5 minutes;Parkville, MD ufo sighting I was walking to the store heading north, when I noticed a triangles in the sky coming from the east heading north.  They were not blinking but they had movement, like changing colors from red to orange.   I noticed a plane in the distance which flew over the triangle.   Once the plane came alined with the ufos it disappears within the triangle, then reappears.   After the triangle moved towards the clouds more lights from the east started to move towards the path of the tiangle.   I stood there for about 5 minutes watching them move in formation towards the north.   In total their was at least ten lights I saw in the sky.;39.386;-76.54
