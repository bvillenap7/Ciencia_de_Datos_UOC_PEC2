I arrived home from my girlfriends house about  22:00   looking up in the sky I saw a aircraft moving from nw to se with no sound.  had  red and green lights.   I first thought just a regular commerical aircraft.  but then it stopped  moved off to the right  circled around some like it was searching for something then moved from sw to ne.   then stopped again  paused  again, then from my position moved east.  then I lost sight of it.   I am not saying this is a UFO  but it did not move like any aircraft I ever seen.  and it was not a helicopter it did not have the sound.    couple weeks ago the maryland state police chopper had been over head in the early morning searching for somebody and the noise was loud.  it also appeared to high in the sky for small aircraft.  just writing what I think I saw.  I do not drink. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));39.386;-76.54
