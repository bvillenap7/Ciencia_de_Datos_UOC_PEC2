This wasnt just a star...it was something more;2011-01-29 02:00:00;2 MINUTES;This wasnt just a star...it was something more I came outside from working and happend to look up at the sky, it was a really clear night.  The sky was filled with stars.  I noticed what appeared to be a star moving across the sky.  It went from pne side of the sky to the other in a matter of mabe 2 minutes.   I was on the phone talking and I was so excited, as it passed over my building I ran inside to meet it out front but it was gone.  About 15-20 minutes later 2 jets went pass flying in the direction of the craft but they were too far behind, too slow and not even high enough. This thing was as high as the stars.  It was awsome.  I've seen things before but never like this and never this long. It didnt zig zag, I couldnt make out the shape it just went from one side of the sky to the other.;39.386;-76.54

Roughly a thousand tiny green lights in the sky moving the in the same directions at first, then slowly moving into a line, then quickly scattering.  Followed by a loud explosion type boom from the direction the lights were last seen.;39.386;-76.54

Very freaky and no it wasn't an airplane or a shooting star.  Waited fifteen minutes didnt see it anymore after that.! Gave me goosebumps and my hair stood up on my arms;39.386;-76.54
30 plus slow moving flashing green lights moving across night sky;2015-05-30 21:40:00;4 minutes;30 plus slow moving flashing green lights moving across night sky Small flashing greens lights seen moving across night sky.  All moving about the speed of a typical aircraft, no sound, no abrupt movement, no trails, just blinking lights as if there were about 30 small aircraft all following the same path across the sky.  Did not appear to fall from sky, merely lost sight as they got further away and became to faint to see.;39.386;-76.54
