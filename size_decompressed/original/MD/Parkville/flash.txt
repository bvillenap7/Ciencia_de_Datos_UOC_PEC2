I was driving home when from the corner of my eye I see a blue bright light moving fast accross the sky.  At first I thought it was fireworks or something, but there was absolutely no noise at all.  It just ended up disappearing.  It scared me because when I saw it I thought it was coming towards me, but then I didn’t hear it crash or see were it went.;39.386;-76.54
