I looked through binoculars, and noticed it was slowly moving.  Saw what appeared to be a trail of light in an oval shape, and when I got the binoculars focused, I could see it was a craft in a saucer shape.  It slowly faded away, then came back for maybe 30 seconds, and faded away again.  I've noticed its presence before, but never had gotten a better look other than a naked eye.  This was 5 miles SW of the MD/PA state line (Parkton), and at an altitude of about 2500 feet.
