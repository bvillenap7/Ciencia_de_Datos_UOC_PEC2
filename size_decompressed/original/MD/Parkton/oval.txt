Two grey, oval shapd object hovering.;2015-10-20 07:14:00;5 minutes;Two grey, oval shapd object hovering I saw two grey, oval shaped objects hovering in the sky.  I was on 83 south just before the Mt. Carmel exit.  The traffic was backed up, so we were able to just sit and observe.  They did not have any visible lights.   After about a minute, one shot off really fast towards the Hampstead direction.  The other, hovered in one place for about five minutes before disappearing.   We saw similar objects in the same area around the same time about 6 months ago.;39.644;-76.6695
