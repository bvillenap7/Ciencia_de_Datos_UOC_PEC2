3 red lights flying in a trinagular pattern in the Halethorpe area.;2017-01-01 00:00:00;1 minute;3 red lights flying in a trinagular pattern in the Halethorpe area. Was driving home with girlfriend and I noticed 3 different, reddish lights.  They were moving in an irregularly shaped, triangle pattern.  I noticed that they weren't incredibly too far off in the distance, but couldn't make out anything more that reddish blurs, moving at a constant speed.    Now I live close to BWI so I see planes come and go all the time.  These were not airplanes or balloons, we can assure you.  They were headed west, fairly slowly, until the lights just sort of faded out.  Very strange.  I even considered it being a new Christmas toy someone received, like a drone.  Nope.  Not three of them so far apart, moving at the same speed, so high up.  Strange.   Why my background is important, I don't know.  I'm not on meds nor should I be.  I'm not senile or blind.;39.2293;-76.6907000000001
