Around 2100 june 17 2010, there was a brilliant green neon light in the sky to the right of what appears to be the big dipper.  If If held a ruler up to the sky it may have measured an inch on the ruler.  The light was elongated and pulsating.  It would then split into 2 then merge back to one. It was clearly not coming from the earth/ground. It was not a srobe projecting to the sky.  It was up there and brilliant.
