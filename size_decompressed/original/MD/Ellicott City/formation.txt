Two white rectangular objects about 20 - 25 degrees above the eastern horizon.  Noticed three consecutive days between 6:15 and 6:30 pm.  Same distance apart each day.  Objects were stagnant and hovered (no movement in either horizontal or vertical direction). They were not emitting light because they were getting dimmer as it was getting darker indicating they reflecting off light from Sun.  As they were higher up in the sky than trees objects and homes on ground, they were brighter as long as sun set completely in the horizon.;39.2574834782609;-76.8161217391303
A lined formation of brightly lit objects moving West to East, 12-15 objects in two groups, ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-27 21:03:00;2 minutes;A lined formation of brightly lit objects moving West to East, 12-15 objects in two groups, one of 5 and another of 7-10. I do not have much information because this happened a few minutes ago from writing this report although I will be as accurate as possible. At 20:55 on Monday I went out to walk my dog and I was out there for about 8 minutes before I looked up into the night sky and noticed 4 objects traveling in a straight lined formation with a 5th object trailing behind slightly. The four aircraft were evenly spaced apart and it seemed as the 5th object was catching up somewhat. I then looked behind the lined formation of 5 aicraft and noticed that there was not another one behind. This is when I ran to the window where my brother was sitting in the house and I started knocking on it getting him to come outside real quick because I thought the formation was very unnatural. It took my brother about 20 seconds to put shoes on and when I brought him outside more objects appeared, this time about 7-10 aircraft with even spacing in between them and travelling in the same strai! ght line and direction as the previous craft. They were moving in a straight line although some of the aircraft seemed to wobble slightly, it was very small almost unnoticeable unless you focused on them. The direction that these aircraft were traveling was West to East at a slightly downward angle moving more or less Southeast. We live surrounded by tress so the both of us could only see them for about a minute or two and as they continued moving in their straight line. I checked a flight tracker online to see if there was anything like this being reported and nothing showed up which is when I came here. I looked up the Starlink Satellite tracker however all of the satellites pictured there did not seem to match up to what I saw because they were almost directly above us maybe a little bit farther North.;39.2574834782609;-76.8161217391303
