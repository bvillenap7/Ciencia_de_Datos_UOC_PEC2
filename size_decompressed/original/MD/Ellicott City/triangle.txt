Large triangle UFO seen on Interstate 95 in Maryland.;2014-12-29 03:55:00;1 minute;Large Triangle UFO seen on Interstate 95 in Maryland. On the Morning of Monday, December, 29th, 2014, my mother and I were driving back to Pennsylvania from a trip to Florida.  As we drove through the state of Maryland, at approximately 3:55 AM, according to the dash board clock, I noticed a large bright light glide over interstate 95, almost directly over our car, just enough to get my attention.   I was driving about 70 mph and pressed my face against the front windshield to get a better look at it, and to my amazement, I saw a triangle craft with two oval lights on the back corners of the craft and a large red light in the center.  I could also make out a very dark point on the craft which I thought to be the front of it, or the tip of the triangle.   It stopped and hovered over a group of trees as I drove down the highway.   I quickly screamed to my sleeping mother in the passenger’s seat to look out her window.  She woke up and immediately saw what I was yelling about.  She was mesmerized.  I was trying to look at the craft and the road at the same time and that was when I noticed that the edges of the craft were more rounded, almost like a popsicle stick.  It had two layers, on the bottom was the color of the cloudy night sky, and the top was a very brilliant black color.   I fumbled for my phone that had a camera attached to it and my mom watched as it hovered over a group of trees.  It hovered only about five to ten feet over the tree tops.  She got a better view of the craft and said that the red light in the center of the “V” was very “unusual” and very large and red.   When I took out the camera to take the picture, I aimed the camera towards it, but it went from a stationary position above the tree line, to completely disappearing out of view and I couldn’t get the picture taken.   She told me that when I took out the camera and aimed it, it was almost as if “the UFO knew I was about to take a picture and took off”.   We both became very excited from what we just saw and then I took notice! of the time and it read, 3:55 AM.  The approaching exit that ! was then seen was for the Ellicott City off ramp.;39.2574834782609;-76.8161217391303
