UFO sighting Ellicottn City, MD;2010-07-10 02:00:00;5 minutes;UFO sighting Ellicottn City, MD. Went out for a walk with my son, he couldn't sleep, night had low cloud cover.  We were looking for fireflies in treeline as we often do, and saw oblong shaped white lighted thing circling above tree line, it was coming in and out of view every 30 seconds or so as the complete circle was beyond our vision.   My son and I discussed at length what it could be, there was no sound, and after watching it for several moments we got a bit spooked and went inside while it, I assume, was still circling it was not directly overhead as it appeared to be about 300-400 yards in front of us over the tree line.
