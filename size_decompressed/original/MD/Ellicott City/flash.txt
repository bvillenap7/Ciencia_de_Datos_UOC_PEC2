Bright White Light Moving at High Rate of Speed East to West Above Route 40 @ Route 29 in Ellicott City.;2013-06-17 21:00:00;3 seconds;Bright White Light Moving at High Rate of Speed East to West Above Route 40 @ Route 29 in Ellicott City. I was driving North on Route 29 just before Route 40.  I saw a round bright white light from the east above Route 40 headed west above Route 40 at an extremely high rate of speed. It did a tiny little loop and kept going west.  It may have been a second or three but it was so fast. It was too close to the ground to be an aircraft and also too small.  It was just a bright white light, not so bright that it hurt the eyes though.  It was like a super sized version of an LED light.  I was shocked that I could not find any other reports of this event online.;39.2574834782609;-76.8161217391303
