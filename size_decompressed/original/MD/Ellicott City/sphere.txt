Alt  about 2000 feet . had wobbling effect when red fashes occoured about every half second. At  05:00 me and my associate were outside work. Skywatching a object weve seen four times. It was about two thousand feet altitiude and glowing a golden color. It  flashed about every half second a red  pulse of some sort. I rationalize it's heating the atmosphere. The object was seemed to hover in that location  but had a wobbling effect similiar to the coriolis effect . In my binos  , I tried to determine the range. My associate used his compass to  get it's direction. It was 78 degrees north east.  With daylight it faded to a point. Then a field around this object surrounded it and it disappeared by 06:00 a.m. also a  airliner flew past this object and  didn't seem to acknolge it's location.;39.2574834782609;-76.8161217391303
