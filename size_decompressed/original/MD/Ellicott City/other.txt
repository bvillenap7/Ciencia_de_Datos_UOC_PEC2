I drive an 18 wheeler over the road, I was traveling north on US 29 in MD and wanted to stop at a store for some breakfast/lunch.  I took the US 40 exit east then at the light I went right instead of left (wrong turn) this headed me into a residental area which is bad for big trucks so I knew I had to turn around so I took the first right down the street and went 1 1/2 blocks and I saw a person?? walking a dog.  They had a gray hooded sweatshirt on pulled on their head and facing away from me.  I guess the truck startled her (I say her due to the body shape) and she turned around very quickly and i saw a face i have never seen before except in alien report drawings.   She was about 5 foot 1 in to 5 f 4 in had an oblong face with a sunken nose, creamy pale skin, very small mouth, and two very large all black eyes that just stared at me.  I was kind of shocked and didnt think to stop for a closer look till I was past her 1/2 a block, with curiousity getting the best of me.  I made a U-turn in the intersection to go back for a better look.  When i got turned around she was gone which is also weird becauce it only took less than a min to turn around.;39.2574834782609;-76.8161217391303
Dumb bell shaped UFO over Ellicott City;2008-01-27 04:30:00;00:20;Dumb bell shaped UFO over Ellicott City I was working on the weekend as I usually do at the beginning of the year due to project deadlines.  Anyway I left my office here and traveled west on Rt.40 to turn around and head east towards Dunkin Donuts. While sitting in the left turn lane I had the feeling of being watched (my hair on the back of my neck was standing up) so I paused at the intersection and looked upward into the sky. There it was off to my left, a solid white, extremely bright circle with a slightly smaller bright circle of light off to the right connected by a line of bright whiteness again.  It looked like a dumbbell sort of. I looked down at the road to refocus my eyes and rubbed them for 3-5 seconds and looked up again and it was still there.  I have never ever seen anything like this.  No one else was around or on the roadway.  I am not sure if this was one ship or two connected together.  I was terrified and drove off making my U-turn and heading down to Dunkin Donuts.  I did not observe any other aircraft in the area and the object(s) blacked out the background.  They were just slightly smaller than the size of a water bottle cap held at arms length.  To my eye they were about the size of my thumb at arms length.  I would estimate the altitude of the object(s) to be anywhere from 1000 ft. to 10,000 ft. It was difficult to tell.  I am very level headed and am a Civil Engineer with amateur Astronimical Experience and have never seen anything like this.  Each object had to be at least as big as an individual airplane.  I did not see the object(s) move at all.;39.2574834782609;-76.8161217391303
