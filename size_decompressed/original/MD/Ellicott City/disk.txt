It disappeared out of thin air. I was riding the bus home from school at 2:20 pm around September 2004.  I was looking out the window of the school bus and saw a very shinny metallic disk shaped object in the sky.  It stayed in the sky for 7 seconds then disappered out of thin air.  It didnt make any noises.  There were atleast 12 other people on the school bus but when I turned around no one was looking out the window.  It like it was a couple miles in the air.
