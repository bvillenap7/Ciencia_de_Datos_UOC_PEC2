At first I thought I was staring at a brilliant star.  It caught my eye as I was on the phone staring out my window.  Then I saw lights blinking from it making me think it was a plane.  Then I realized that it's not moving much, if at all.  The lights were blue and red and white as far as I could tell.  At first it looked as if it was about one thousand feet high in a mostly clear sky.  Seemed to be hovering there for the longest time and then took a very slow northwest direction.  It was too fast to be a star, too slow to be a plane and a helicopter just didn't make sense because it was to high and for too long to be searching for someone without a searchlight.  I called the local news and tried calling the airport.  I walked outside to get a better view to see if the window could've been causing the blinking/twinkling effect, but the lights were still blinking with an unobstructed view.;39.2574834782609;-76.8161217391303
