It had rungs and was just like a ladder bent into the shape of a circle.  Also it had approximately four rectangular boxes equally spaced around the circle.  It was basically gray in color except at one end it progressed to black.  It was stationary. I could not see any attachment.  I was looking for a balloon or something. I was at the intersection of Route 165 & East/West highway.   I am not a trained observer but I would estimate it was about 3,000' to 5,000' feet high, about 100' to 200' in diameter.  The 'rungs' had to be 10' to 15' in length and you could see thru it in the center and between the rungs.  The strangest thing to me was it didn't move and there wasn't any noise.;39.6162;-76.4684
