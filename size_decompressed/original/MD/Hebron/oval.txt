5 crafts- Hebron, Maryland at 9:30 pm on April, 27. 2019;2019-04-27 21:30:00;15 minutes;5 crafts- Hebron, Maryland at 9:30 pm on April, 27. 2019 On April 27, 2019, in Hebron, Maryland, 4 of us adults observed 5 unidentified crafts in the sky.  At first, there were only three of the crafts.  Then later we observed a total of 5.  The crafts  appeared to be oval in shape, they were balls of light, they were opaque in color, they appeared fuzzy and not bright yet they were lit up.  They started out as three crafts that were doing maneuvers in a synced motion in the sky.  After several minutes two more appeared making a total of  five.   There were four of us who observed the activities of these crafts for a good total of 15 minutes.  The activity, we tried to get on video, but it was not showing up on the phone screen.  The synced activity was that these crafts appeared to be Zooming back-and-forth very high speed in the sky.  They were going from a south to north direction and then from north to south.  Then they would go from west to east and then east to west, and then they would circle amidst each other.  Then these crafts would fly directly over our head and then zoom back down towards a southerly direction.  The following day we saw numerous reports online that many others had seen the same lights in our area.  These crafts and lights made no noise.  They were very quiet.   After observing these lights for quite some time we observe that they were making a specific synced pattern in the sky.  The beams of light seemed to be coming from above as there are no lights or beam shining from down to up.  The lights would’ve been coming from above. These lights circled each other.  They were making criss-cross patterns.  Then they’d fly directly above our heads making maneuvers.  Please investigate the siting of these crafts.  Thank you;38.4055;-75.6928
