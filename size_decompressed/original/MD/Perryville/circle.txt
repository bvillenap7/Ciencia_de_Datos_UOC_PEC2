Dark round shadow blocks light from moon;2009-12-29 23:00:00;10 sec;Dark round shadow blocks light from moon It was about 11:00 PM.  on  a night in December.  I let my dogs out to go to the bathroom and was standing on my front porch and just happen to look up.  The moon was not quite full but it was very bright and the clouds were across the whole sky, they were very spotty like a net.  You could clearly see the moon and the halo it cast on the clouds.  I saw an round shadow move through the light cast on the clouds.   I don't know the size because I don't know the distance but it was the same size as the moon in the sky.   I could tell it was behind the clouds and and it totally blocked the light from the moon.  Once it was out of that halo of light I could not see it any more.  It made no sound.   It  moved through the sky the way a spot light does, kind of a sweeping circle but it was not a light.  All of this happened in about 5 seconds.  I went and got my husband and we both watched for about another half an hour but never saw it again. ((NUFORC NOTE:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.
