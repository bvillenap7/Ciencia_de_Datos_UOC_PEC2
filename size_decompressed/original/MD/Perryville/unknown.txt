Faint Object Stealth looking;2001-11-18 04:00:00;30 seconds;Faint Object Stealth looking I was watching the Leonid meteor shower and saw a meteor slightly to the right of where i was looking , when i nothiced something very faint to the sight , it sorta blended in with the sky.It was gray/black i guess.It resembled a Stealth Bomber in shape but more rounded in at the back of it.I saw no lights at all on this object.It was very hard to see it period.I heard no noise at all from it.It seemed pretty high up in the air , but a lot less then high flying jets(30,000 ft)My guesstimation would be around where a cesna would fly.I ran in the house startled after seeing it , then grabbed my camera and ran back outside , but nothing was there.;39.5650833333333;-76.0646791666667
Large aircraft flying WAY TOO LOW.  ((anonymous report));2017-06-01 19:35:00;30 seconds;Large aircraft flying WAY TOO LOW Two extremely low flying aircraft went over my house at 7:35PM on 6/1/2017.  They were so low that it shook my entire house!  The sound was immense.   They had to be extremely large aircraft.  They were over before I could get to the window to see, but it was so loud and rumbling that I truly thought they were going to crash somewhere close.   I see and hear aircraft ALL the time due to be close to BWI and other small airports in the area... NEVER have I had any of them sound like that or shake my house like that.   Thought someone should be aware. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of the report elects to remain anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));39.5650833333333;-76.0646791666667
