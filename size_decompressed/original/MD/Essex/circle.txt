Bright white orb over Essex, Maryland.;2015-04-04 21:00:00;20 seconds;Bright white orb over Essex, Maryland. On 04 April, 2015, at approximately 2100 hours, (9:00 PM), in Essex Maryland over looking the Chesapeake Bay, near Heart and Millers Island and viewing the night sky, the following was observed.  A very bright white circular light was observed traveling from the south to the north.  The object was at a great altitude, unknown as to the altitude level.  The object would resemble the likeness of the planet Venus, showing very brightly in the sky as an example to the size and shape, but much brighter.  I would estimate this object to have been traveling approximately 10,000 mph at least.  It covered the entire length of the sky in about 15 to 20 seconds.  This was not a meteor, as there was no tail etc.  This object covered the sky at an enormous rate of speed. In this area and at the time of sitting, is Aberdeen Proving Ground, a US test site for weapons, etc..  Over the Proving Ground was the governments test blimp for the part of the entire east coast.  My understanding is that this government test blimp, records and monitors any and all aircraft, missiles etc, and anything in the air over the entire east coast.  If so, this test blimp had to pick this object up on their radar.;39.3055;-76.4517999999999
