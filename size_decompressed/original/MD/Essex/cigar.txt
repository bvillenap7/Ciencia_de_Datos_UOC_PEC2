I saw 3 ufos on Saturday 11/07/2020. I was off Eastern Blvd in Essex,MD. 1st cigar shaped ufo was all white flying pretty low, just took off and didn't make a sound. 2nd cigar shaped ufo was all white with red stripe around the middle. It came about 20-30seconds after 1st ufo. This was also without any sound and slightly higher than the 1st. The 3rd cigar shaped ufo was all white with black stripe around middle. Now this one was high but I could still make out it didn't have wings or a tail. As the other 2 ufos had no wings or tail.  It looked like a flying submarine. I was in shock what I was seeing that I didn't get my phone out until the last ufo came. I aimed my camera at the ufo and took a picture but when I was taking it there was a glare so strong I couldn't see if I had it on my camera. Well I guess I didn't have it in my frame because I didn't see anything but blue sky when I went and looked at it. The 1st ufo was so close, I know what I saw and it ! wasn't any plane!!! If you have any questions please feel free to contact me!!!;39.3055;-76.4517999999999
It was as clear a sky as there can be,no clouds whatsoever. I just arrived at my destination to work.

I got out the truck and looked up to see a cigar shaped craft that seemed to have just taken off because it was very low. The craft was all white and looked almost like a submarine in the sky! The 2nd craft followed,as soon as the 1st was out of my sight the 2nd was there. It was a bit higher in the sky than the 1st, and was all white with a stripe of red in the middle. The 3rd seemed to follow formation with the other 2,because they to be spaced apart perfectly.  Within 30 seconds of each other.  The 3rd was all white with a stripe of black in the middle. Each craft was a bit higher than the last was. But I cannot stress this enough, that these were not airplanes! The crafts had no wings and no tails on them. I was so amazed with what I was seeing that I didn't get my phone out until the 3rd craft and tried to take a picture. But the suns glare was so stron! g on my screen that I thought I aimed my camera at it and later when I checked to see the pic, there was nothing but blue sky on my pic.  Either I didn't aim correctly or the craft wouldn't show up on my camera!;39.3055;-76.4517999999999
