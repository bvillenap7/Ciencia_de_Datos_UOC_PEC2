My father and I were driving home.  It was dark.  There was a green light that suddenly moved very fast downwards.  It was wide and VERY fast.  We came over a hill and on the ground we saw a tall object with flashing orange, red, blue, and yellow lights.  These led to a flashing green light close to thae ground.  We left and returned about 20 minutes later.  The lights were gone.  We could not tell if the ship was.  We circled down a back road to see the back of the house.  From there we could see a pulsing green light.   As we left a massive military jet flew over head.  We belive the military was searching for the craft. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible hoax, we suspect.
