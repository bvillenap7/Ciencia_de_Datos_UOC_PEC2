very bright intence light and slowly fades to nothing and moving slow;2006-07-26 22:55:00;1 minute;very bright intence light and slowly fades to nothing and moving slow I looked up and seen I thought the brightest star I have ever seen and to my surprize it was moving slowly It looked as if the light was aimed at me, it was very high in the sky I thought it could be a aircraft at first but the light slowly dimed and there was no blinking lights what so ever I ran to the house ad called my wife and kids to see but the light was getting dimmer all the time moving very slowly, the night sky was very clear I lost sight of it but my wife said she seen a small white dot moving and then it was gone as if it was going up into space. I can't explain what it was but it was very strange to see something like that espcially that bright. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous  provides no contact information.
