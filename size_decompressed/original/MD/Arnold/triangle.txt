Silent triangle spotted while leaving for work early in the morning.;2014-03-27 04:30:00;10 minutes;Silent triangle spotted while leaving for work early in the morning. Leaving for work at usual time.  0430.  I am a Fireman, and was putting my gear in my truck.  I noticed three white lights in the sky.  Not unusual, as I live about 20 miles from BWI airport and can see the flight path of landing planes.  I don't really know why, but I looked up again and could clearly make out the shape of a large triangle. It was a clear sky and cold out, about 30 degrees.  I live next to the woods and it seemed to be right over the treeline.  If I had to guess, I would say it was about 40 feet long.  The lights remained on, did not flash, were white and did not look like search lights, more like a marker light you would see on a boat.  It did not make any jet or plane like noises.  It was silent.  Looked like it was just floating along like a blimp.;39.0476;-76.4940999999999
