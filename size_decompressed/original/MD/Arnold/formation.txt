15 purple lights quikly change formation before vanishing.;2006-08-20 16:45:00;1 minute 10 seconds secon;15 purple lights quikly change formation before vanishing. About 15 purple lights that changed formation 3 times before they disapeared.  I was walking home from school one day when I decided to look at the sky for a moment. It was a cloudy day and the clouds were very dark. I couldnt belive my eyes. I saw about 15 bright purple lights moving very fast from the east to west. I guess maybe 600 mph. They were very high, just below the clouds and were in c formation for about 5 seconds. Then they made u turn and flew right over me. I expected hear a noise like a sonic boom or some thing but there was no sound. And when they turned around, they seemed to change formation at the same time and they seemed to merge together into one large bright light. This light seemed to change colors very rapidly. But as soon as they merged, they broke off into about 20 lights. They all turned to back to the original color purple when they lined up side by side. All that happened in about 5 seconds before they were suddenly engulfed by a bright blue light that came out of no where and the light slowly faded. It was completly gone after about a minute and the lights had gone with it. But the area in the clouds where they had been looked like it was glowing a purple-green color and looked like it was radiating some kind of plasma. But it only lasted a few seconds. I looked around to see if anyone else had seen it but I was the only one who had seen it. I drew a sequnce of pictures that depicted what I saw. I was to nervous to tell anyone about till now. I hope that explanes every thing. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));39.0476;-76.4940999999999
