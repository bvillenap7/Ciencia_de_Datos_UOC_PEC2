Red object over Arnold/Annapolis Maryland;2013-12-01 02:25:00;20 seconds;Red object over Arnold/Annapolis Maryland Clear starry night, the object was a reddish color, and moved extremely fast through the sky.  The object was very high up, and to the naked eye, looked like a red star accelerating at a high speed.  It of course was not moving as fast as a shooting star, but roughly 7 to 10 times faster than a conventional airplane moving through the sky at night.;39.0476;-76.4940999999999

As I was watching it because it was going at such a straight up position I saw something fly towards the plane at a speed of light speed. It stopped near the plane in the air. The sun reflected in it for a few seconds so I could see it was round and silver color. It stayed near the plane for about 10 seconds then it flew off so fast, with the speed of sound and it disappeared into the sky. It absolutely could not have been anything else.;39.0476;-76.4940999999999
