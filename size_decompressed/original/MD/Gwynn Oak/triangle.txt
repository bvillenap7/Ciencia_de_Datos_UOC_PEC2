It was a sight to see,;2010-12-08 21:28:00;21 seconds;It was a sight to see, My wife and I just got home from my job .I opened my gate to my back yard, Then I just looked in the sky .Then I turned around and looked up and saw a glowing formation of lights ,looked like a geese formation with nine lights .It moved slow and fast at the same time .with no sound ,Just pure silence.Then it faded away ,But my wife didnt see it .Well my brother lives up the street from me and he sd he saw it too ,said the ufo was huge about 2 1/2 football fields by 4 football fields .He sd he could hear the engine sd it was a sound he said he never heard in his life...Im glad he saw it  too so I know that I wasnt just seeing things, It was the real deal....We are not alone....;39.3327;-76.7358
