UFO over Gwynn Oak MD;2007-03-31 06:55:00;3 minutes;UFO over Gwynn Oak MD My 12 year old son was waiting for his school bus and saw something in the sky with white halo light around it. He said that it was big as a airplane and made no noise. He took a picture of it with his camera phone, but it came out as a white light with a dark circle in the middle. He says that it was about 3 houses from ours (which is VERY CLOSE) and drew a picture of what he actually saw.;39.3327;-76.7358
