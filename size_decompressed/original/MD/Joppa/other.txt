The craft was in view for about 20 miles, hovering at about 500' overhead.  Since the craft was near the US Army Aberdeen testing ground, it may be a test space program vehicle.  The craft was about 30'-50' high and 100' long, with a whale-like shape (rounded front to back, higher at back, flat bottom, dipping in middle.) The color was brilliant white.  There was a very large, round, bright light aglow in the middle, bottom.  It made no sound.;39.4239;-76.3514
