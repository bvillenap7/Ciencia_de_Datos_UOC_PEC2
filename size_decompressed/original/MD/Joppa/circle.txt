Two bright stationary lights.;2017-08-01 21:00:00;15 minutes;Two bright stationary lights I was driving home from work, when I saw two very bright orange lights.  They weren't flashing, but seemed to be pulsing.  They were stationary.  I captured them on a rough video, and then one of them dimmed to a star like brightness, but they seemed to be low and under the clouds.   We do have a lot of bases around here, but my fiancé and I have been seeing a lot of action in the sky.  Recently, we keep seeing star-like moving objects that get extremely bright and then fade into nothing.  Possible ISS?   I showed my fiancé the video and he thought they were bizarre, but said maybe it was drones.  Definitely very bizarre sighting.;39.4239;-76.3514
