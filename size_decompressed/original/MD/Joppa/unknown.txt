PD));2009-09-19 19:30:00;2 minutes;Bright searchlight hovered at high altitude and then rapidly ascended from view. At approximately 1930 EST I was in my friend's back yard in Joppa, MD when she indicated to me a strange light in the sky just above where Venus was in the sky.  Since there are no other stars that bright in that vicinity I assumed it was some type of aircraft.  There appeared to be a searchlight emanating from the object highlighting some clouds, which made little sense as there was little visible cloud cover and what there was was high-altitude cirrus clouds.  After approximately 2 minutes of observation the object ceased the searchlight and ascended rapidly until it vanished from view. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));39.4239;-76.3514
