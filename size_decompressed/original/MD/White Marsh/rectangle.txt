Never seen anything like this ever.  It was hovering over top I-95 by the white marsh exit.  It didnt fly away.  But was not visible to me after I turned.  It may have been a new type of helicopter.  I dont know. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));39.3921;-76.4106
