White Object over I-695E;2012-06-02 16:30:00;5 minutes;White Object over I-695E My girlfriend and I were driving down I-695 toward White Marsh and she noticed an extremely white cigar shaped object in the sky.  It was moving South at a steady speed, and had no visible markings.  As we were driving some trees passed in the way of the object and when we passed them, the object was gone.;39.3921;-76.4106
