Rotating oval shaped object with multicolored lights moving in very fast erratic patterns.;2017-11-06 22:00:00;20 minutes;Rotating oval shaped object with multicolored lights moving in very fast erratic patterns I stepped outside for a cigarette, when something caught my eye.  I saw what looked like an oval shaped rotating set of lights go overtop of my house.  I watched it move in erratic very fast patterns.  It stayed in one area of the sky moving up, down, and side to side but remaining in the same general area for about 15 minutes.  Several planes flew directly over the object and with each one the object would fly up towards the plane and back down as the plane passed by.  It then flew off in the distance for a minute or two then came back to the same area before it flew down behind the trees, where I lost sight of it.   It made no sound and appeared to be rotating quickly with multi-colored lights around the exterior.  I got a weird feeling when at the same time all of the dogs in the neighborhood started howling.   I have been researching Ufos for years and am always watching the skies. This was the most amazing thing I have ever seen.;38.4857;-75.742
