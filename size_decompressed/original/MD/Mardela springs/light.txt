When I was standing at my vehicle facing W-NW (towards Vienna/Cambridge) I saw what appeared, at first, to be a bright full star due to the similarities between the brightness of the light and apparent light shape except that it was moving slowly from right to left at a slight downward angle. On second guess I assumed it was a shooting star or something of that nature so I stood there for a moment to watch the beauty of the nature when, approximately 10 seconds after first sight, the light made a sharp ~95Â° turn, accelerated, and dropped from the sky at nearly thrice it's original speed.  After that my view of that portion of the horizon and sky was obscured by the treeline near my residence.  All in all, I simply do not recollect any such thing that could move in such a way.
