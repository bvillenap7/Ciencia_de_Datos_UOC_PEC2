Also spotted in Annapolis around the same time. In late December 1995(?) around 7:30, my mother and I were driving when a large green fireball flew over I-95. It was very quick. We were both intrigued and frightened so when we returned home, I called several places to check for reports or meteor showers and such. No one had called in and there were no meteor showers. Later, I found out my aunt and cousin had seen the same thing around the same time while in Annapolis.;39.2151;-76.7540000000004
