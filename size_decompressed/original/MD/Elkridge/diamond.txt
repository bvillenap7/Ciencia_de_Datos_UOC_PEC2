Approached by diamond shaped white light on I-95 alone at night.;2020-10-09 23:25:00;3 minutes;Approached by diamond shaped white light on I-95 alone at night. My wife was driving alone down i-95 around 11:30 last night 10/9/2020. She saw this upright diamond shaped light. It was pure white and just hovering in the sky to the south as she was heading towards it, around the intersection of 32 and 95 in the Elkridge area. It was brighter than the moon and seemed to be contained. In other words it was very bright but it was not throwing light on trees or clouds around it. There were no other cars around, and as soon as she noticed it, it started moving towards her. Around this time she muttered, I fee connected to this thing. and Its coming for me. She felt completely mesmerized by it, and not afraid at all. She slowed down to about 10mph and it moved as it if was going to come straight in front of her car appearing closer and larger in size from her perspective. It came to a stop above her and she felt like she was going to pass out. The bright white light was out at this point and she saw a w! hite light on the front and rear corners, and there was a green and red light in the other two corners. The object appeared very similar to the color of the sky, but seemed to be a solid shape.Then she felt she should keep driving. I must have stayed behind because she lost track of it and the rest of the drive was uneventful.;39.2151;-76.7540000000004
