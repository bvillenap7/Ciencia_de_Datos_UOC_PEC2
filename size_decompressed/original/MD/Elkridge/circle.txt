Round metallic ball.;2010-01-01 12:00:00;2 seconds;round metalic ball I had stopped for the traffic light.  I looked up at the beautiful light blue sky, with little puffy white clouds, and instantaneously, a silver metallic ball just appeared in front of one of the clouds.  And just as fast, it moved up and behind the little puffy cloud, as to say oops they can see me. I don't have the latest tv or tech., but the weirdest thing about this is it was the most 3d experience I have ever had. This was the traffic light going west on little Patuxent Pkwy, waiting to make a right on 108 to go to Lowes home improvement store in Elkridge, MD.;39.2151;-76.7540000000004
