They resembled the Phoenix Lights and we immediately stopped since we had never seen them before. We got out of the car and watched them for about 10 minutes. Then we left and got binoculars. It took my boyfriend and I about 30 minutes to get back since we were on foot. When we got back only three were left. One of the three disappeared When we looked through the binoculars we could see two disc shaped craft with four windows and them were emanating beautiful white yellow light ( which is how we could tell they were discs) We could see lots of very little planes with emergency lights circling these objects. The scale of the UFO versus the planes was ENORMOUS. We watched for probably another 20 minutes as the planes circled these 'crafts' through our binoculars. Then the craft on the left descended, then flew directly upwards, and once ag! ain descended. The craft on the right descended maybe five minutes later. All the planes with the emergency lights that were circling them descended as well with them. We believe they may have landed. This was right next to BWI Airport, there were planes taking off while this was going on.;39.2151;-76.7540000000004
