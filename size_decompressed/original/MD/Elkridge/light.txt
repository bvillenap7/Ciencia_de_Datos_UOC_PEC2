Second ufo sighting in same spot in two days;2012-04-11 20:00:00;20 minutes;second ufo sighting in same spot in two days I reported a sighting from 04-09 as well, again i was driving home from work with my boyfriend mother. I saw the same Phoenix Lights looking lights in the exact same spot in the sky over my neighborhood. I saw three of them, they were just giant bright white lights. I got binoculars and came back with my boyfriends mother. I looked at them through the binocular and they were either much farther away or much smaller then what i saw on 04/09 and there was hardly as much detail. There was three 'crafts' all i could make out was a row of distinguishable ' windows' looking lights on each one. that was all the detail i could see however there was no emergency lights or anything to convince me this might be something man made. They all hovered for about 20 minutes. There were no aircraft pursuing them and planes were taking off from BWI all around them. One by one they hovered and then descended straight down and they were gone ( they landed maybe?). I am not con! vince what i saw on 4/09 and 4/11 were the same the only similarity were the 'windows' on the 'crafts' there appeared to be maybe three or four in a row?? the other similarity is the way the light looked before i looked into the binoculars and the fact there was so many. they also had a weird aura of hazy white light.;39.2151;-76.7540000000004
