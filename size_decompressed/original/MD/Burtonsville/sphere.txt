Green circle seen north of exit for Burtonsville MD falling from sky at 0:05;2014-10-24 00:05:00;2 minutes;Green circle seen north of exit for Burtonsville MD falling from sky at 0:05 Object witnessed between 0:05 and 0:11 on 10/24/14 while driving North East right before the exit for Burtonsville, MD on I-95. Lasted for no more than 2-3 seconds. Viewed from the driver's seat of my vehicle over a mile away. Sighted to the North off to my left. An object suddenly appeared in the middle of the sky heading down towards the ground at a steady rate and out of site. The speed seemed too fast to be a normal day to day aircraft and did not seem like a comet nor a meteor because there was no trail and the light did not diminish or flicker. It was a circular bright green light.  The hue of green was in likeness of a traffic light. It was too large to belong to a normal aircraft one would see day to day. I take this route home from work at this time of night every night since December 2013 and have never witnessed anything like this. Helicopters and planes are common, but not anything like this.;39.0913;-76.9377
