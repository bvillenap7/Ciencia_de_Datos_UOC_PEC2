Bright orange oval shape traveling slowly through sky near burtonsville and olney maryland at 1:30am feb 1st 2012;2012-02-01 01:30:00;10 minutes;bright orange oval shape traveling slowly through sky near burtonsville and olney maryland at 1:30 am feb 1st 2012 Driving down New Hampshire ave toward Norbeck Rd, at one thirty in the morning I saw a bright yellow/ orange oval shape traveling in the sky above Blake High School.  It was moving slowly, like a cloud almost.  I lost sight of it behind trees.  When I turned on Norbeck rd I saw it again, moving slowly.   As I got to Norbeck and Layhill, it went in the direction of Olney/Rockville, slowed down and slightly dimmed before going behind trees again.  What I saw could have been emitting its own light, but it made the clouds around it shine very brightly.  It looked like a piece of the sunset in the middle of a dark sky.;39.0913;-76.9377
