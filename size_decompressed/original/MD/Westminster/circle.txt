A magical star looking thing at a football game, right before 2 undeafeted teams played!;2009-08-19 20:45:00;60 seconds;A magical star looking thing at a football game, right before 2 undeafeted teams played! I was at a football game, one was ended, and one was just beginning.  The previous team was having a meeting sitting down, right underneath the craft, although it was high.  The craft sort of resembled a star, although the odd thing was there was a white triangular shadow underneath it. By the time I had noticed it, several other people were looking up at it, including about a third of the football team.  About 20 seconds later, it slowly faded away.  Ironically, when all the people were looking up at it, I was getting out my camera, and as soon as I turned it on, it had began to fade away. The craft was a bit higher than a normal plane would be, although the shadow stretched far down, but not nearly far enough to reach the ground.

Orange Lighted Object Spotted In Westminster, MD.;2011-04-17 23:30:00;3 Minutes;Orange Lighted Object Spotted In Westminster, MD. It was 11:30pm on Sunday night, and I had looked out the sliding glass door in my bedroom because I thought one of my shed’s motion sensor lights had been activated.  It turned out that it was just the bright moon that evening that was producing the light through my sliding glass door.  At that point, I saw an orange ball of light in the sky when I was facing south-east towards Arters Mill Rd.  It was hovering over the tree line and was probably a mile or two from my location.   I was surprised that it was stationary given how strong the wind was that night and the coloring made it look like a small sun.  It was bright orange and really stood out in the clear sky.  I was so intrigued by what I was seeing, that I didn’t want to leave to try and get my camera that was on the other side of the house.   I watched it for a couple of minutes and at one point, it faded out quickly to black and then reappeared at full brightness.  About 30 seconds or so later, it just vanished so fast that it seemed like I was directly behind it because I saw no movement to either side of where the object was situated.   I don’t know what it was, but I’ve never seen anything like it before and there were no flashing beacon lights like helicopters and airplanes use.  It was circular in shape and it appeared that there was a red aura around part of it, but it was faint.  I live out in the country and am pretty much surrounded by farm land and some other houses a few acres away, so I’m not sure what could have produced that light.  I also did not hear any noise aside from the wind noise that evening.;39.5790153153154;-76.9990657657657
Pin-point Red lights, flying in somewhat formation, close to each other;2012-12-23 06:10:00;5 minutes;Pin-point Red lights, flying in somewhat formation, close to each other The lights where spread out, but way too close to be airplanes. One was behind the rest, but gaining on the other group. They were red, not blinking, very, very few clouds and pitch black out. No sound at all. At one point, 3 made a line like Orion's belt. They were traveling basically South East.;39.5790153153154;-76.9990657657657
