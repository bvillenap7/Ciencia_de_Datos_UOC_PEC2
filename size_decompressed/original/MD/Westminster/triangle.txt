We inspected further and the object did not move the same way as a plane or helicopter.  We observed the object for over 30 minutes.  It had red and blue lights flashing.  We looked with binoculars at the object and compared it to other objects in the sky such as stars and airplanes.  The object remain stationary for a long period and then slowly dissipated away.   Overall, the object was like nothing we have ever seen. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));39.5790153153154;-76.9990657657657
Two triangular crafts seen in Carroll County.;2019-09-15 21:30:00;1 hour;Two triangular crafts seen in Carroll County. Seen in Carroll County, MD, looking south on route 27.  Triangular shaped crafts (2) with red and white twinkling lights.  Strange back and fourth movements, very sporatic.  Stayed mostly in one spot, but disappeared behind pine trees very quickly one by one within a half hour of eachother.  We used binoculars to really get a good look at it.  We could see that it was not a plane and it was moving too slow for it to be a helicopter.  One of the crafts seemed to be emitting beams of lights while the other were pretty stationary.;39.5790153153154;-76.9990657657657
