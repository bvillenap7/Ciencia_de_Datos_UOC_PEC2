Strange Helicopters Over Development;2008-01-31 21:00:00;5-10 minutes;Strange Helicopters Over Development I was sitting in my living room when I heard a loud aircraft that shook the house. I ran outside to see neighbors across the street looking outside too. Then I could see the craft were 2 Apache helicopters flying very low at 500-1000 ft. They were flying in formation and obviously were not in whisper mode. They had no visible lights or typical lights on, I could only see them due to the light reflection. I thought this was strange since there are no bases nearby. I could hear them for about 5 minutes before they flew over the development. No other aircraft were visible in the vicinity at the time.;39.5790153153154;-76.9990657657657
