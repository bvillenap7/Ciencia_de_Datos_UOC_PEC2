Intensely bright, crescent shape to round in SE night sky;2011-05-28 04:24:00;14 mins;Intensely bright, crescent shape to round in SE night sky I need to preface this with the comment that I have never before believed in UFO’s as I am genuinely very cynical and could always rationally explain away any oddities. This made a firm believer of me. I looked out my bathroom window and noticed an incredibly bright shape. Initially it was oddly shaped – best described as cheeto shaped--long, slightly curved on right side and indented on left.  But it later changed to a round shape. I watched this for almost 15 minutes, the time may not be exact, but close.  At one point I left the room to get binoculars (I knew my camera would never capture any detail ) and the binoculars did not add any detail either as it was so bright!  Shortly before it simply disappeared, it appeared to shoot out beams in red and blue.  They were similar to this _-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_- and shot out from the lower left side, then the lower right side, but not at the same time.  Then it was simply no longer there.;39.5790153153154;-76.9990657657657
