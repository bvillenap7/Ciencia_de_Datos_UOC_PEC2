A huge Fireball changing shape and colors captured on video while moving over our house!.;2007-05-26 21:10:00;5 mins;A huge Fireball changing shape and colors captured on video while moving over our house!. At about 9:10pm eastern time a very large very brightly lit triangular object appeared hovering over a house down the street. I yelled to my 12 year old step son to come quickly! We watched it change into a diamond shape back to a sphere for about 20 seconds. At that time I told him to go grab the video camera!. He didn't know where it was so I quickly went and grabbed it and plugged it in the outside outlet. By the time I captured it on camera it had started to move north.  I caught 10 seconds of it before it flew over behind my house. It was changing colors of green, blue, white and red. It darted so fast that I yanked the cord out of the outlet and tossed the video camera to see the rest. I ran around to the side of my house and continued to watch the object move north. The fireball dimmed and I was able to see four to five smaller red lights around it. I was also able to see a gray shadow around them with what looked like a blackhole in the center. Then as quickly as it came it disappeared over the mountains.;39.5790153153154;-76.9990657657657
Small Orange Light Observed Traveling South;2008-08-10 21:50:00;2 seconds;Small Orange Light Observed Traveling South I was taking out the trash and usually look around at the sky afterwards. I am an amateur astronomer with a good head on my shoulders. I was just about to go inside and was standing on my porch. I happened to be looking eastward and observed an orange object travel at remarkable speed from North to South. At first I thought it to be a meteor but I remembered that it was contained within the clouds as I saw it passing thru them. I thought this to be strange since the clouds were around 1000-2000 feet. That meant to me that it might have been something else. The object was silent and no other aircraft were observed in the area at that time.;39.5790153153154;-76.9990657657657
Orange glowing object that didn't blink or flash it looked like it was on fire;2013-08-16 23:00:00;4 minutes;orange glowing object that didn't blink or flash it looked like it was on fire Outside facing east right at 2300 when orange glow like plane running lights came towards my direction.   It was about 1 mile away then drifted at a steady pace high in the sky at jet level and continued west.   The object made no sound as it drew overhead or as it passed by.   The orange light was not large but hard to judge at night, no wingtip lights just the steady orange glow.  It looked as if it was on fire.;39.5790153153154;-76.9990657657657

Fireball in sky over Westminster, MD, Dec 3, 2015, straight edged bottom to it.;2015-12-03 20:12:00;5-7 seconds;Fireball in sky over Westminster MD, Dec 3, 2015, straight edged bottom to it I was driving east on route 140 (just leaving Westminster, MD) at 8:12pm EST and I saw a white fireball cross the sky 30 degrees above the horizon on the drivers side of my car.  It left a long trail in the dark sky. I was passing the local Starbucks and Taco Bell when I saw it.  It was about 30 degrees in the sky, heading away from me. The fire ball streaked across the sky then flamed out.  Visually it looked like one half of it burst into flames because it was half a ball of flame and the bottom half looked like someone put a straight edge ruler to it and the bottom half was dark.  I couldn't see an object, just the weird effect of a straight edged glowing object flaming out.;39.5790153153154;-76.9990657657657
