Cluster seen over Carrol County ,Maryland;2003-07-26 05:00:00;30 sec;Cluster seen over Carrol County ,Maryland My wife and I were driving from our home heading east on rt.140 towards Westminster, Md. We were out early heading for a day on the beach, it was clear and I was just looking out the window at the stars. I noticed what at first glance I took to be just a commercial airliner at normal cruising altitude, not paying much attention to it. On giving it a second look there were no strobes and no navigation lights (red or green), what I observed was an irregular oval cluster of six white lights with one white light somewhat trailing the rest and off to one side. The cluster was moving to the west more or less as could be seen as it passed by known stars. The lights were not overly bright, about the same as what one would observe on a comercial airliner at normal cruising altitude from the ground. I watched for perhaps 30 seconds and one by one the lights went out all most at the same time. I don't have a clue as to what I saw , but I have lived in the country all my life and see aircraft at night on a regular basis(We live on the approaches to Dulles and BWI airports and are not far from the outer markers). Never saw anything like this before. Unfortunately my wife was not able to see as she was driving and this was on my side of the vehicle to the south of us. I wouldn't have even noticed this had I been driving or not just looking up at the time I did.;39.5790153153154;-76.9990657657657
