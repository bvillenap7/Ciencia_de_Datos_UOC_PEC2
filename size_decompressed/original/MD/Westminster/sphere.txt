The object was moving from west to east at a steady pace then behind this object appeared three additional bright white light objects that would be the size of an egg held at arms lenght.  The light from these objects was as if it was revolving.  There was no color, just white light. then there were two other groups of the objects that appeared out of the western sky and flew east out of my sight.  No sound was made and the distance in the sky seemed to be about 1500 feet high.  They were close.  I counted 15 objects, the flight pattern seemed to be in a straight line.  I live two miles from the Westminster Airport and I'm used to seeing all types of flying craft, but at 46 years of age I've never seen anything like this before. I called my husband, who is a police officer for the State of Maryland and he tried to contact the local airport at 2100 hrs, but it was closed.  We watched the news to see if anyone else reported the lights in the sky but to no avail.;39.5790153153154;-76.9990657657657
Sphere shaped orange glowing object in the night sky;2012-05-28 21:30:00;15 minutes;Sphere shaped orange glowing object in the night sky Seen a large sphere type shaped object lift up. Stopped in motion.  The object was glowing like how the sun would kinda look doing an eclipse. Traveled north.  Made no sound at all. The object looked like it was beating like a heart would beat.  We followed the glowing object til it disappeared which was about 15 minutes.  The object just vanished out of sight. The object was an orange glowing sphere object.  The sky was dark with some stars.  The orange glow was brighter then anything else in the sky.  Even brighter then the moon.  There was only one object.  The object flew about a few hundred feet off the ground.  Did not leave any trail like a plane would.;39.5790153153154;-76.9990657657657

It approached my direction at around 500 feet above the ground. There was no sound. It made it's way directly over my apartment complex and I lost sight of it. I caught the first few seconds on my security camera.;39.5790153153154;-76.9990657657657
