6 lights in 1-3-1-1 pattern changing speed and position near Westminster, MD.;2014-02-07 22:40:00;5 minutes;6 lights in 1-3-1-1 pattern changing speed and position near Westminster, MD. 6 lights came over treeline in a 1-3-1-1 formation.  No sound at all.  Lights were a bright, pale white, almost orange.  All were a single, spherical light, not a point of light, but round in appearance.  The three lights grouped together changed speed and position several times, came to a stop and shifted positions again.  All six faded and disappeared, but did not change position in the sky before vanishing (ie, did not disappear over horizon).  No clouds, completely clear out and plenty of stars visible.  Have short video clip of them showing shift in positions, but had hard time focusing due to it being dark out.;39.5790153153154;-76.9990657657657
