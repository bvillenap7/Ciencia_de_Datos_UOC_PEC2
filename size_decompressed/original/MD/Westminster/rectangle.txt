Large Square 4 lights on each corner, flying smoothly;2018-11-21 03:00:00;1-2 minutes;Large Square 4 lights on each corner, flying smoothly Standing outside at approx 3 Am and stared up into the sky like I usually do, smoking a cigarette at that time.  As I stared I noticed 4 tiny lights and they were moving smoothly over the sky in unison.   I stared closer and my eyes adjusted to seeing a black square with a light on each corner.  It was moving very smoothly and knew at that moment that was no drone.   I live in the countryside and no drones have ever been seen around my house, and it was moving as an airplane would, or rather a much slower shooting star.  It lasted about a min or 2 before it was out of my view.   Living in MD, I'm sure plenty of aircraft are tested and I have seen events before of testing the government has issued a statement before hand.  I can assure you this was something I have never seen before.  If the aircraft I saw was as high as an airplane, well then on the ground this thing would be absolutely massive.;39.5790153153154;-76.9990657657657
