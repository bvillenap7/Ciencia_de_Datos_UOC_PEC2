Three different nights in the past week, I have seen a bright colored light changing from green, blue to red.  The first 2 nights, it looked like a slow shooting star but no trail and it appeared to speed up and travel straight down very fast.  Last night, 2-19-14 @ 6:15 pm, my neighbor asked if I had seen a green light north of our house.  She said she had seen it travel from the tree line and shoot up travel sideways, back and forth and went back down. She said 2 fighter jets went towards that direction.                                       	 As we stood there, the light shot straight up like a flare, changing colors, blue, green to red.  The light appeared to float to the left and then shot right.  It changed speed, direction, traveled up, down, sideways and finally dropped below the tree line again.  There is a Naval Research Lab in that direction.  This was all witnessed by me, my 12 yr. old son and my neighbor.  I am going to wait tonight around the sa! me time with a video camera and see.  It has been in the same place 3 nights .It traveled and changed direction too fast for air craft.;38.6075;-76.6046000000001
