Space photographer??;2020-07-18 22:30:00;15 seconds;Space photographer?? Bright ball of white light looked like a satellite flew straight across horizon but gave a huge flash similar to a camera flash but created a circle of light as bright the moon.  Afterwords appeared to put on afterburners to gain speed as it flew off straight into the horizon.  My question is flash photography necessary or used with our satellites or military recon aircraft?  If not that may leave me with more questions...;39.6565;-76.2267
