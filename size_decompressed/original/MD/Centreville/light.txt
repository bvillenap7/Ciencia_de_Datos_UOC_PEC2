red lights, soundless, hover or move with blistering speed.;2005-11-24 21:00:00;several hours;red lights, soundless, hover or move with blistering speed. This is only one of signtings of these craft my sister and I have seen on several occasions over the open farm land on the Eastern Shore of Maryland.  We have begun to call them The Sky Guys.  They are out there nearly ever night.  They appear to be bright red lights in the sky.  They will move at blistering speed, then stop on a dime and stand still.  Then one or two will wander over, appear to dock, then in a heartbeat be miles away in another portion of the sky, where they will hover or slowly wander again.  Usually there are eight to ten of them. Sometimes only one will appear.  Wish someone would check them out!  They are totally and completely silent.  My sister's car will frequently stall in the early mornings when she heads out when these things have been in the vicinity. ((NUFORC Note:  If anyone else may have been witness to the lights the person reports here, we would welcome other reports for corroboration sake.  PD));39.0595;-76.0477
Two lights hovering in one spot, splits then goes in a direction. bright light faster than any helicopter that would hover like that;2012-06-11 00:00:00;all night;Two lights hovering in one spot, splits then goes in a direction.  Bright light faster than any helicopter that would hover like that. Some one posted this and it is exactly what i have seen. They hover in the same spot for a while, then split and travel towards the bay brige, then back. Very strange, i see it almost every night. Occurred : 1/5/2012 00:00 (Entered as : 01/5/12 0:00)  Reported: 3/15/2012 8:42:31 AM 08:42  Posted: 3/16/2012 Location: Kent Island, MD  Shape: Light  Duration:4 hours 2 hovering lights seen near kent island....  Almost every night you can see 2 lights from centreville, and the surrounding areas, that are towards Kent island. The 2 lights hover like helicopters but have weird flight patterns.  We have seen them go from 2 into 1 then back into 2.  There lights will get very bright and then go dim and then to nothing, then back to bright.  They move all different ways. But pretty much stay in one area. They are lower than the starts, more on the horizon, and you have to be in an open area to see them.  One night one of the lights went away, and it looked like a plane was coming over to the other light that was still there.  When it approached the light it did 4 90 degree turns (in a square) and then started to hover with the other light.  They are very strange, and they are out almost every night.;39.0595;-76.0477
Hovering light in the sky with disappearing lights toward the ground and shadows.;2018-12-14 03:15:00;45 minutes;Hovering light in the sky with disappearing lights toward the ground and shadows. Woke up around 3 a.m. to what sounded like an animal screeching.  Looked out bedroom window but didn't see anything.  Looked up to the sky.  At first glance it could have appeared as a star but I realized it was moving.  Watched the light (yellow in color) for awhile and saw it hover right, left and down slightly.   Woke my husband so that he could confirm what I was seeing and he did.  He also confirmed what I was already thinking...that occasionally there would be a flash of light to the left or right of this main light.  The light never moved much aside from the slight hovering movements.   After about 30 mins I saw flashes of white lights just above the tree line behind my house but in the distance.  There was about 4 or 5 of them.  Each would continuously flash.  One moved more right away from the others and slightly up in the air while the others disappeared.  I continued to keep an eye on the main light that was still moving slightly in the same spot.  When directly looking at it, I didn't see much around it.  When I looked to the right it appeared like there was a shadow in the sky to the left of the light.  I couldn't make out what it was and when I looked directly at it,  I could not see it.;39.0595;-76.0477
