Black circle turns to flashing light, speeds away and disappears.;2008-08-30 18:15:00;1 minute;Black circle turns to flashing light, speeds away and disappears. Basically, we were looking up at the sky and saw a black dot very high up, moving very little to not at all.  It was higher than some black birds that were flying around, so we thought that it might've been a black balloon that flew up really high.  Ignoring it, we turned away, but felt that it was still very odd so I kept looking back.  After a few seconds, I looked back up and saw the black object turn to bright white, like a flashing light (not like fire).  I told the other guy to look at it again and he said that he saw it as well.  It then proceeded to move very quickly and speed off and up.  Eventually, it was no longer visible.  Both of us agreed it was very odd.  I have never been a witness to a UFO or thought that I was before, but I can fathom no other explanation.  This is because of the odd shape and color change (and the fact that it went from pitch black to bright white flash of light) and change of speed (from stagnant to very fast) and its disappearance.;39.5331663636364;-76.3434281818181
