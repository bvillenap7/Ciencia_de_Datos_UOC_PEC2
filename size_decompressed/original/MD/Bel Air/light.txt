Great  speed of lights;2003-10-08 20:23:00;7 seconds;Great  speed of lights I was walking with my husband at 8:23 PM when I saw 5 lights go in a straight pattern diagonal line over the horizon line.  The last light faded out in a second. There is no way an airplane could travel that fast and then be gone. Two of y neighbors later reported thay had seen the similar strange lights 3 times that evening.;39.5331663636364;-76.3434281818181
two lights beside eachother  shooting upward str8 into the sky at various speeds;2011-01-22 12:40:00;1 minute;Two lights beside each other  shooting upward str8 into the sky at various speeds   I was laying in my living room and looked out my back sliding door and saw a bright light.  I figured it was a star or plane but kept looking to see this thing was moving straight upward unlike any angle of travel i've seen a plane or anything moving in.  I kept looking to see it just looked like two bright lights conjoined together one light beside another just moving at various speed like steady to slow to faster just going str8 up into the sky until i couldn't see it anymore.  That was it, I know that wasn't something normal.  Not any identified looking flying object i've seen in my lifetime.;39.5331663636364;-76.3434281818181
Bright white orb traveling fast over Bel Air;2012-10-13 01:00:00;5-8 seconds;Bright white orb traveling fast over Bel Air I was smoking a cigarette in my back yard around 130 am, about 2 hours ago, as I had my eyes fixed upon a certain area in the night sky.  As I was looking in the sky a very bright light appeared from the area left of me behind the houses in my development.  The object was an orb or ball shape about 1 or 2 miles away but in my line of sight and flying very low about the same height as a commercial jet would fly when traveling over city/populated region or en route to airport.  The ball moved at a rate that no aircraft would possibly be able to travel, as I watched it for about 5-8 seconds it was extremely bright.  The orb left no trail behind it nor did it disappear back into the atmosphere as a shooting star would.  If I had a clear line of sight on the objects trajectory I would have been able to see its further path as the object vanished over the tree line. I did not jump to conclusions as to report UFO sighting right away, I have researched for the past 2 hours the meteor shower calendar and iridium flares, and I have discovered that the most recent shower was October 7 and 8th, also I considered the possibility of an Iridium flare from a satellite but after looking up the next scheduled flare, the time was yesterday October 12th at 8:30 pm for my area. OBJECT DESCRIPTION Shape:   Circle/Orb  Color:  White/Similar to star but slightly whiter  Speed:    Not sure exactly but was much faster than any jet, helicopter, or manmade aircraft.  Speed/Altitude ratio of the object could not be matched by any aircraft built by man in present day I would know my family has many ex air force  Trajectory:    Somewhat diagonal but straight path, no evidence of slowed speed, constant path  Environment:      Clear sky, quiet no sound around me or from the object itself, I was able to see other stars in the sky as well and the North Star also,;39.5331663636364;-76.3434281818181
Reddish light.;2014-07-04 00:30:00;30 seconds;Every night, while walking my dog, I stare at the stars as ive always been fascinated with space, on the way back in i noticed a dim reddish light moving from west to east.   At first i dismissed it as a renegade firework, being july 4th, but as it slowly moved across the sky it never exploded, it in fact kept flying on.  I thought maybe a plane but i work in aviation and regulations require aircraft to utilize anti collision lights especially at night.  Not sure if it has any correlation but when i tried to use my star gazer app to check for a possible comet, my phone shut off.   After it disappeared over the treeline i went inside and my phone began working again.;39.5331663636364;-76.3434281818181
White light bright flash.;2014-07-05 23:30:00;1.5 minutes;white light bright flash Walking my dog tonight, i looked up near the big dipper, when to the right of the constellation, i saw a dim white light slowly moving downward.  While looking at it speculating what it could be, it gradually got brighter to what I would describe as 10x the brightness it previously was for a second and went back to its original state much more rapidly but still continued to move downward through the scorpio constellation.  I checked my star scope app to check for any comets coming by but none.  I was thinking maybe a shooting star but ive never seen one move so slow.;39.5331663636364;-76.3434281818181
Bright Light.;2017-09-16 01:15:00;10 seconds;Bright Light It was late.  I was outside on the side of my house.  I was smoking a cigarette when I noticed a bluish light...it was bright enough to make me notice.   Then in a matter of a second the light was coming from above the trees.  It was so bright I had to squint my eyes.  It lite up the two trees that were directly in front of me.  I got up out of the chair I was sitting in and leaned over the porch balcony and nothing was there.  It was dark again.   I saw no cars coming in or leaving my development.  It scared me.;39.5331663636364;-76.3434281818181
