I was doing first aid at a high school football game ( one of the school nursing duties in this county).  At approximatly 8:30 one of the students on the sidelines pointed out 2 white lights 4 inches apart at arms length over the school building.  The crowd watching the game had their backs to the object.  There was no sound.  I thought at first it was a security light on top of the roof of the building. The appearance fo the lights was similar to metal halide lights. We observed the lights for several minutes. I at first suspected it was a helicopter and was looking for the navigation lights, but did not see any other than the white lights.  The focus of the lights was on the game.  After several minutes the lights began moving slowly towards us.  Altitude was low probably around 200 ft if that. Distance was about 400 yards.  No sound was noted the wind direction was from the east which should have carried the sound towards us.  The craft moved forward for about 30 seconds ( very slowly) then turned completly on its side and changed direction from NW to SE. The craft flew on its side with wingtip down wingtip up and nose to SE. As it turned I was able to make out the shape of the triangle. The craft was very large.  A couple of cessnas flew at the same altitude that night in the same area, and 5 of them would have fit into the wingspan of this craft. Also we had no problem hearing the other aircraft in the area. The craft flew on its side the legnth of the school building then turned on its back and flew away I have been waiting to see if any further reports would turn up.  A number of people who saw the object said it had to be an aircraft ( reason being is that they didn't believe in UFO's)  However, because of the size and the manuevering capability demonstrated I feel that it was definetly something unusual.  The actual object was only visible when it turned on its side.   There was no sound from the aircraft during the entire sighting. The craft was in back of the main crowd, there were only about 11 people in a position to see it.  we were unable to get any photos of it.  It would have been difficult because of the stadium lights. The craft did not appear threatening at any point in time. We didn't feel afraid but were excited and elated to see it. No unusual smells were noted and no missing time was experienced. ( When I first noted the object I kept an eye on hte stadium clock just in case) There were aircraft in the area, however none were there at the same time as the object. Mostly single engine type craft were out that night. This sighting was reported to Major Filer and MUFON since I'm one of their investigators.  However, If your investigator is interested in this I would be happy to talk with him/her.  I appologize for being so late in getting this report out.  Circumstances in my life have made it difficult to keep up on my UFO stuff. You may release my name but its important to keep my address and telephone confidential.

Me and my friends each 12-14  were talking when we suddenly spotted three stars in the sky flashing and then they moved away.;2002-07-09 21:50:00;10-20 minutes per night;Me and my friends each 12-14  were talking when we suddenly spotted three stars in the sky flashing and then they moved away. I was talking to my friends and i look over and i see 3 stars standing still flashing and they all made up the shape of a triangle in the sky.  It was about 9:50 p.m. when me and my friends first saw them.   I assumed they were just stars so i went back to talking but when i looked back the top one moved next to the bottom tight one and then moved away.  I kept my eye on them and at about 9:55 the two bottom ones started moving in different directions.   The 3 things were in the south direction, right behind a house.  They looked like they were out in space.  This happened 7/06/02, 7/08/02, 7/09/02 and I believe will happen tonight.
