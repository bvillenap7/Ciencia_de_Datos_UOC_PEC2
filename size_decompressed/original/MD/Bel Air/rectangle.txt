Went from hovering to 70+mph to complete stop w/o accelerating or decelerating.  ((anonymous report));2017-07-04 21:30:00;1 hour;Went from hovering to 70+mph to complete stop w/o accelerating or decelerating. I went outside for fireworks and saw one that wasn't exploding.  It was just sitting still in the sky and not moving.  Then it changed color and moved in a triangular pattern at 70+mph without accelerating and it made a sudden stop without decelerating.  It changed the light color multiple time and went out occasionally.  It was followed by a larger object that circled the 2 smaller ones.

I saw an object traveling North in the sky. It was light blue and rectangular in shape  It was 3 dimensional like a shipping container.  It was traveling at what appeared to be the height and speed of airplanes.  There was no trail behind it.  It seemed to be very large.;39.5331663636364;-76.3434281818181
