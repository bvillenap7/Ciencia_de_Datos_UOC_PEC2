Round turquise, blue white disc hopping across the sky like a skipping stone.;2001-11-20 23:00:00;seconds;Round turquise, blue white disc hopping across the sky like a skipping stone. A round disc like shape, which was turquoise, blue and white, appeared instantly in the sky and moved 4 times, like someone was skipping a stone in water, quick , rapid, and then disappeared, having a very tiny trail of light behind it. I waited to see if there would be a crash or explosion. It was very large, very close, and very unusual. I have never seen anything like this at all. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and found her to be an exceptionally good witness.  She decribed the event with fine detail, and the object witnessed sounded to us to be bizarre, and probably not a meteor, in our opinion.  PD));39.5331663636364;-76.3434281818181
