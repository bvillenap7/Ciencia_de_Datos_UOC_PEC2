It was traveling from northeast to southwest it seamed to suddenly drop from the sky and followed a path that started high and decreased lower in the sky even though when the object did disappear it was still very high but lower from where it started.We lisitened for an explosion like fireworks, but we heard or saw nothing. We figured it could not have been a meteor because the object would have been white, red, or yellow and it would have not followed a curved arc shaped path. The object from our car window was very large and it was travling at an extremly fast pace, like a falling star. The object had a faint blue center surounded in green. There was no tail. You could defiently see a blue dot in the center of the object and you could also notice where the objects edges were. When the object disappered it was going very fast and was still very high above the horizon. It disappered instantly with no explosion, sound, or change of shape or color.

Large glowing egg shaped light that rotates.  At certain points in its rotation, you could see dozens of lights.;2007-04-05 21:30:00;40 mins;Large glowing egg shaped light that rotates.  At certain points in its rotation, you could see dozens of lights. It was the shape of an egg, standing on its end, rotating. The color was white, at first it looked like a very bright star, much larger than anything else in the sky.   After using binoculars, we noticed that it had a large number of lights at certain points in its rotation.   It hovered for quite some time, then it just darted off like...blazing fast.   As fast as it dissapeared, it then showed up again.  It repeated this about 4 times.   The sky was very clear, no clouds, and it was 9 30 at night eastern standard time.;39.5331663636364;-76.3434281818181
