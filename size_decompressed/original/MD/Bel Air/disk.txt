They were not air planes because they were moving up and down. I didn't know what it was so I went to get my wife she didn't believe it either.All of a sudden they disappeared out of the middle of nowhere.;39.5331663636364;-76.3434281818181

A smaller bright white light shot off from it later I’m not sure if this is a UFO sighting or not, honestly. I’ve never had much cause to believe in them or disbelieve, but I’ve never personally witnessed anything that I couldn’t explain in the sky. The last few nights, my family and I have been watching something strange going on. I’ve tried finding cosmic explanations for it, but this doesn’t fit the pattern. I’m reporting it- feel free to use or discard the information as you see fit. We’re only able to see this at night. There’s something stationary in the sky with lights going in a circular pattern from right to left.. they then blink several times and start the pattern all over again. If the moon were a clock, it’d be sitting at the 8 o’clock position in relation to the moon.  It continues this pattern for several hours, then around 11:30pm, something shoots off from it.. it looks like a bright white light.. it goes much faster than any falling star we’ve seen, and it zips over into the big dipper and fades out. This is the fourth night we’ve watched this happen. I live in northeastern Maryland. I called friends in Baltimore who also saw the same thing happen. There were 8 of us here and 10 more people in Baltimore who all saw the same thing. As I said before, I’ve never seen anything like this, and I honestly don’t know if this is just some technology we haven’t seen before, or if this is something unusual. I just thought I’d pass this along on our behalf. Until this incident, I had no idea there actually was a place to report this kind of thing. I ran an internet search just to see if we might find some government agency to discuss this with. Thank you for your time.;39.5331663636364;-76.3434281818181
