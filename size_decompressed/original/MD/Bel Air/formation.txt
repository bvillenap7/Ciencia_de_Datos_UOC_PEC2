3 round glowing objects in triangle formation in Southern sky approx 22:30 in Southern sky;1998-03-30 22:30:00;3-5 sec.;3 round glowing objects in triangle formation in Southern sky approx 22:30 in Southern sky Monday evening approximately 22:30 hours + _ 1/2 hour, just above (or below) star Alphard in the Southern sky from Bel Air, Maryland.     Whitish, 3 objects larger than, but not as bright as Jupiter as seen in the sky. Traveling from E to W in a triangle shape very swiftly in a straight line, no sound or blinking lights, observed for only approx. 3-5 seconds before lost in trees.    After thinking about it I can only assume it was a meteor that broke up into 3 parts no tail, but I am aware some shooting stars have no tails.   No weird feelings, loss of time or any of that.     Please write back to ArtLight@Juno.com and let me know if you are the right org. to report this too, and also if there were any more reported sightings around that time.
