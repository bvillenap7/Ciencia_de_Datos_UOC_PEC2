On Jan 7, 2002, approximately 5-10 minutes before 6pm EST that night, while driving home from work with my wife, I noticed out of my driver's side window (i.e., to the East), a bright green light that traveled, from my perspective, approximately North to South.  The light moved smoothly and in a manner similar to how I've seen a meteor travel through the sky.  It seemed like a point source, and had absolutely no trail whatsoever, ruling out, in my mind, it being a meteor.  The location of the light as it moved was to the east of my vantage point, and I would estimate it's location, based on where I was and where it was, as being perhaps somewhere over the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay.  I heard no sound, although I was in a moving car travelling approximately 55mph to the South.  It was of very short duration, visible for no more than a couple of seconds.  My wife was unable to see it from her location in the passenger seat. I know this entry is late, but I feel it's worthwhile to do so as I recently found this site, and when I checked its archives to see if there were any other reports of what I saw, I was very suprised (and relieved) to see many other sightings that clearly were of what I saw that night.
