I was laying on my truck bed when I saw a blue sphere appeared in the sky about the size of a star.  It seemed as if it was loosing altitude and next thing I know it picked so much speed and it was gone within a blink of an eye.  What was so amazing was the fact it was as silent as a heart beat.   A few minutes later there was so much air traffic that it may have been too obvious as if to cover up the sky with their aircraft lights.   Not only that, the stars in the sky where also going on and off as if they were turning their lights on and off.;38.9493;-76.9587
