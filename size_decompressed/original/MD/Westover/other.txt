The object was a half star it consisted of three points in the front, and flat in the back, the object was moving above a golf course in Westover MD.   The object appeared to be almost a chrome color and it was about 300 yards above the ground.  The object had no lights, no distinguishing marks, and I can't really give the estimate on the size, but it was very large, and extremely awkward looking.   The object was quiet, I could only hear the sound of my car going down the road nothing else. Hopefully someone else in the area has also seen this, this occurred during the evening, when people would be heading out on a Friday.   Also I had interference with my radio station, a local station which usually comes in clear.;38.101;-75.7406
