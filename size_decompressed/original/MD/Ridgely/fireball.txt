White streak of light low in the sky heading East to West in the Northern sky.;2008-08-15 05:30:00;20 to 30 sec;White streak of light low in the sky heading East to West in the Northern sky. While setting outside on a very clear day having my morning coffee I was looking north into the sky. At that time I saw what looked like a streak of light flash across at a low angle to the horizon. It caught my attention because it was very WHITE.  The light was trailing smaller pieces coming off from behind and was heading toward the west.;38.9597;-75.8813
