Small round off white orb flying medium low at tremendous speed;2016-03-09 14:30:00;5-10 seconds;Small round off white orb flying medium low at tremendous speed Very clear skies,I was watching a military type jet flying high.  It was heading southwest.   I then see this round orb flying northeast, considerably lower than the jet.  At approximately three times the speed of the jet.  It was small, and the color reminded me of French vanilla ice cream.  In seconds it was gone, no sound, no trails.;38.8593;-75.8363
