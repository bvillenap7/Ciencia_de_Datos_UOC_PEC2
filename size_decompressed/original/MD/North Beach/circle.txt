Orange orb just disappears.;2017-09-24 21:00:00;2 minutes;Orange orb just disappears I did not really give this too much thought until I heard Peter Davenport on coast to coast radio during an interview.  He stated how common these occurrences were.  This is where my story comes in.   I was walking along the boardwalk with my wife it was a clear warm night when I noticed an orange ball floating in the air over the bay, at first I thought it was one of those Chinese lanterns, but I did not see any flickering flame.  This object was perfectly round and was moving very slowly, it came off the bay over the beach across the street.  It was over some of the local stores when it just disappeared and I don't mean like a light shutting off it was like it went through a doorway.;38.7126;-76.5316
