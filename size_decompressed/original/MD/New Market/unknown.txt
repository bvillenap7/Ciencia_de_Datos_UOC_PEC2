I took my dog out to relieve herself at approx. 1 am on approx. 1/18/17 (I am a night owl) and noticed, high up in the sky beyond the roofline of the line of townhouses in which my house is located (perhaps 300 feet or so up?), what appeared to be a group of bright green lights, four in total. I stood and watched and noted that:   1) the lights were bright green only (no other colors) and they were not flashing. 2)  there was a total of four lights and they appeared to be on the perimeter of a round craft of some sort (?). 3)  the craft was not moving it stayed in the same place for all the time I was watching (5 mins.), and remained there as I went back in the house. I did not feel afraid, only curious and somewhat amazed by this sight.  No *primordial* terror at all. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));39.4114;-77.2823
