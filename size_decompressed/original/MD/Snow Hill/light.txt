I was walking my dog coming off the pier when I noticed a white light. It was not very high maybe a little higher than a plane pulling an advertising banner at the beach.  When I looked a bit closer I noticed the object had 3 slightly smaller red lights trailing behind it blinking in unison about every other second as compared to the lead white light which did not blink at all. Curious I thought to myself maybe the lead light was a small plane and the trailing lights may be some sort of helicopter escort but at that moment I realized none of the objects made a sound! I also noticed way off in the distance an actual plane and was reminded of the typical blinking lights you normaly see on a flying vehical and saw that the objects I saw did not display anything like this.   Still unsure I continued to watch as they silently worked their way from north to south along the coast and as my perspective changed to a view from behind I noticed I couldnt really make out th! e lead white light but the 3 trailing red lights now being viewed from behind kind of seemed to now be in the shape of an odd triangle. As this triangle got smaller and smaller as it moved farther away I noticed that they still were blinking in silent unison. I watched until I could no longer make them out in the sky, the whole sighting lasted just under 10 minutes!;38.1879;-75.405
