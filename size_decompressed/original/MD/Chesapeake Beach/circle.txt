Six round orange lights evenly spaced, moving in syncronized formation curving upward until disappearing one by one. On Saturday, September 18, 2010 at approximately 7:30 p.m, I spotted orange colored lights in the sky just below the area of the moon.  The objects were identically shaped, were the same distance apart and appeared to move in a synchronized formation curving upward.  I sat watching as one followed the other and they disappeared one by one into space. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.

Last night, I saw this circular object with blue, red and white lights up in the sky.  This aircraft stayed stationary although it seemed to rotate or it could have been the lights rotating in motion.  I first sighted it around 11:30 pm while I was out on my deck for a smoke.   I kept watching this aircraft for 20 minutes, and then I went to continue watching a movie.  I checked outside before going to bed around 00:45 and aircraft was still there.;38.6712;-76.5331
