Green Fireball over Western Shore of Maryland.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor??  PD));2005-12-13 20:15:00;3-5 sec.;Green Fireball over Western Shore of Maryland A bright green fireball came from the south at a low altitude and arced across the sky from a southerly direction to a northerly direction.   The object appeared in the uppermost part of our car windshield (we were at the top of a hill heading east within a half mile of and  toward Chesapeake Bay.  By leaning forward, I was able to follow its path until it abruptly disappeared shortly after appearing on the driver's side window of the car.   The fireball was bright grass green with a trail of pale green fading to lighter green to white light.  The sighting lasted about 5 seconds. The driver did not  look up fast enough to see it. (the side windows are not tinted - this helped to confirm that the green color was not from the windshield)  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor??  PD));38.6712;-76.5331
