Greetings,  Back in April 2017, I was in Greenbelt, Maryland at the “carwash” behind the Shell Gas Station located off on Greenbelt Road in Greenbelt, Maryland. I happen to look up in the sky – in the “clouds” and it appeared to me as a person to be sitting in a chair.   As I wanted to get a better look, therefore I went to where the NASA Space Center is located on Goodluck Road to where they were at the time building a new entrance.  There I parked my car, got my cellphone out and captured three (3) UFO’s or more in the picture.  Later down the road, I took a selfie of myself and a day or so later I decided to look at the picture and as I was looking at the picture, and slide the picture on my phone over and there was “ET” outside the vehicle looking inside at me.  I did not see him with my eyes, but “He” is in the photo!  Please note, I have “Hundreds of other Supernatural Photos” of me and other entities including the sound-pitch that “Alien Ships” give off to communicate. Also, I still have the original phone used to take the photos. Please NOTE….it’s Real, Real – REAL!;39.0013;-76.888
