Four long red trails Heading Downward Over Greenbelt, MD.;2017-10-04 15:30:00;5 minutes;Four Long Red Trails Heading Downward Over Greenbelt, MD. Driving on 193 in Greenbelt.  Noticed 3 very bright red trails and a forth up and to the right much bigger.  Not in direction of BWI or National.  Looked like heading to Andrews.  Took pics on cell phone.  They were all heading DOWN.  I was waiting for an impact!;39.0013;-76.888
