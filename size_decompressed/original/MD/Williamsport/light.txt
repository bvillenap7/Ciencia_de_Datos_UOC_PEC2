Red, Blue & White Strobes Stationary in the Night Sky.;2013-04-07 02:00:00;2 hours;Red, Blue & White Strobes Stationary in the Night Sky. On a clear night I happened to look though my 10x50 binoculars along a tree line of a forest. I noticed a cluster of strobe lights 1 red, 1 blue, & 1 white, the strobes were flashing very quickly (about 5-10Hz frequency) but not in any cadence with each other.  I could not see any details of the UFO, it was very far off in the distance, atleast 5 miles, I just saw the 3 strobes.  The strobes did not move in position relative to each other, they appeared to be of the same body.  I watched this object on and off for about 90 minutes and it did not move. I attempted to find it in a telescope but was unable before the sunrise washed it out. I have not searched for it again as of yet. What did I see? There may be a simple answer but I never saw anything like this before.;39.5921;-77.8129
Slowy moving object.  ((anonymous report));2018-01-19 08:00:00;2 minutes;Slowy moving object i was sitting in my room, and i heard a sound that almost sounded like a train going by.  my windows started vibrating so i went to go check it out and there was this slowly moving thing with 2 lights....i could see the sky behind it.  it eventually got far enough to where i could no longer hear or see it.  i recorded a video of it.
