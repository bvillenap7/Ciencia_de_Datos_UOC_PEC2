Sighting, no, not “little green men” but something odd last night. It was up in the sky & I can't Identify it, so its a “UFO”, but NOT a “flying saucer” & yes there is another witness.  I don't know for sure what it was but I assume it was one of Musk's Starlink satellite trains? But there are significant differences from other images I've seen of them.  Last night Western MD (39°38&#824234&#8243N 77°43&#824212&#8243W) about 9:30PM a string of 15~20, or so VERY bright white lights in the sky to the South West. (They were so bright they got my attention immediately) Roughly 45° elevation, heading vaguely North. It was a little patchy cloud so they seemed to be blinking on & off, but they were in a crescent shape, not a line like I've seen images of. The whole thing subtended only about 4 or 5°.  Checking various tables the closest contender would be Starlink 24, or 27, but 5 ° subtention, 45° elevation doesn't match. Any thoughts or ideas?;39.5921;-77.8129
