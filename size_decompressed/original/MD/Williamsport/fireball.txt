Green light emmitted from sky in Western Maryland  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor.  PD));2004-12-11 21:00:00;6 seconds;Green light emmitted from sky in Western Maryland We were driving on a small back road outside of Hagerstown Maryland when a bright green light emitted from the clouds. Four out of five of the passengers in my vehicle saw this light as it turn into a speeding ball of light soaring through the night sky. The object was so large that it couldn't of been a comet without striking the surface. One of the passengers actually saw the object change direction as if it were ascending back into the sky. We continued on the back road searching for hills that I could jump my car with and wandered what in the hell we saw. We concluded that it must have been Matt's mom falling out of orbit to find some sheep!!  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor.  PD));39.5921;-77.8129
