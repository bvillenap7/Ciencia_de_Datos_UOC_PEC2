On Tuesday night however I witnessed something that I CAN NOT explain. Just as one of the local aircraft began passing my field of view on my right, a very bright flash occured in front of me, around 60 degrees up from the horizon in the north / northeast. It just appeared. It was an extremely bright oval shaped object, with a dim circle in the middle. It was brighter by far then anything else in the sky. It then began to either move almost stright up, or deminish in intensity to a pin point then disappear. this all took place within the count of 1.. 2.. 3.. 4.., and it was gone. I have waited hoping that I would read, or hear in the Media about a super Nova. I have heard nothing. I have stood on my back deck for the last several night hoping I would see a plane, or something that would explain this observation. Everything has repeated itself routinely except for the above event. One other observation, the placement of the object,[exact distance, and altitude unknown] would have placed it very close, if not over the Peach Bottom Nuclear Plant on the Susquehanna River in Pennsylvania.;39.654;-76.3696
