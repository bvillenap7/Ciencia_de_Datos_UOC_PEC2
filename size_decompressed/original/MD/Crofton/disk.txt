A saucer circles the moon many times.;1987-06-30 00:00:00;can't remember;A saucer circles the moon many times. When I was a child, in elementary school, I was playing kick ball with my friend in his yard.  It was around mid-late afternoon.  It was still daylight, but you could see the moon in the sky.  We both noticed an object flying, circling around the moon,over and over.  It did not appear to be moving really fast from our distance, but it circled around the moon I would guess about every 20 seconds.  Knowing how large the moon is, it must have been going VERY fast.  I did not think of this reasoning at the time, because I was achild.  As a child I didn't think much of the inident because kids believe in imaginary stuff like aliens, but as an adult, it seems very strange.  My friend did make a comment, at the time, about alien ships and astraunats when looking at it.  My friend now does not remember the incident.  I don't remmeber the exact date.  It was sometime between 1986-1988.  1987 stands out in my mind, so maybe that is it.  I think it was in spring or summer.  It was warm out when we were playing.  I don't remember how long it lasted.  I don't think we continued watching it long enough to see it stop.  We had a short attention span.  It looked like a saucer shape, but was far away and could have been looked different.  There was no sound. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));39.013;-76.6742
