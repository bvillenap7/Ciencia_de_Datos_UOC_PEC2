I was in Havre De Grace Maryland to see the Concord Point lighthouse. I took several pictures of the Concord Point lighthouse.   Later that day I downloaded the pictures I had taken.  I selected one of the pictures of the Concord Point lighthouse and printed the photograh on a photo quality printer.  I noticed that above the lighthouse, over the Chesapeake Bay was an object in the sky.  It stood out in the brilliant blue sky. It looked like a metallic object.  When I cropped the picture to get a closer look, it looked pictures I've seen of objects identified as a flying saucer.  I had taken another picture from the same location approximately 3 seconds later.  The object was no where to be seen.  There is a couple in both photograhs to indicate the short span in time.;39.5493;-76.123
