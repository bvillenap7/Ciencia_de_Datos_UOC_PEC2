Cylinder shaped UFO that came to my wedding!;2006-09-17 05:30:00;4 minutes;Cylinder shaped UFO that came to my wedding! It was my wedding night.  I was staying at The Oaks Inn where my wedding was held the night before.  It is located in the countryside in Royal Oak, Maryland.  I went out to the deck to smoke a cigarette when dawn was breaking.  It was then that I saw the brown cylinder hanging in the air.  It looked like a metal drum which was bark brown in color.  It had an antenna sticking out of the bottom.  It was floating above the water and started to move westward toward Easton.  As soon as it was light enough it disappeared in the air.;38.7844;-76.22
