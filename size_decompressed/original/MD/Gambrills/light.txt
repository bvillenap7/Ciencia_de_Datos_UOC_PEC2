PD));2017-02-03 20:00:00;1 hour;Seen a bright light in the sky a lot bigger than any star.  First it was going left then it was going up then it was going right then it went stationary.  Other planes are constantly flying by so we know it's not an ordinary object, me and my friend are checking on it for about 30 minutes and it hasn't gone anywhere.  1 hour later, it has disappeared and we never saw where it went.
