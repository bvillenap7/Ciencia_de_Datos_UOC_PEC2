Disappearing brown pencil object.;2017-04-27 07:40:00;3 minutes;Disappearing Brown Pencil. Between 7:35-7:40 am, on the morning of April 27, 2017, as I was driving north on I-97 approximately halfway between Annapolis and the MD-32/MD-3 exit, I saw a long, reddish-brown, pencil-shaped cylindrical object that appeared to have been “launched,” and was ascending slowly into the sky.  This object appeared to be about five miles straight ahead of me, and approximately 1000 feet in the air and climbing slowly.  Beneath it appeared to be a black plume of smoke within the smoke were flashing lights.   As I was staring at this object, a passing cloud obscured it completely.  I was waiting for it to reappear, but when the cloud passed, the object had completely vanished. OBSERVER:  I am a 58-year old retired Air Force member, currently working as a federal civil service worker for the U.S. Army at Fort Meade, MD.  I was driving to work from Annapolis when I saw this object.;39.0374;-76.6813
