Strange lighted craft in the sky;2018-08-12 00:00:00;5 minutes;Strange lighted craft in the sky Around midnight - I was awakened by a bright light in my bedroom window.  I opened my eyes and noticed some lightning and figured that's what woke me up but as I laid there with my eyes open, I saw a strange light, sort of cylinder shaped that moved in all different directions.  It sort of hovered over my neighbor's house for a few minutes.   The light seemed to have a solid middle with a circular light flowing around it.  I've never seen anything like this strange shape/light.   It lasted a few minutes and then disappeared.   I'm hoping someone else may have seen this.;39.0374;-76.6813
