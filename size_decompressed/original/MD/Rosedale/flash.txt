((HOAX??)) In Rosedale MD.at 2:00 a.m looking up in the sky, I noticed a circle shaped object.  ((anonymous report));2016-08-04 02:00:00;5 minutes;I was outside my home in Rosedale, MD,.at 2:00 a.m looking up in the sky just looking at the stars.  I then noticed a circle shaped object mid way in the sky, not to high up,an saw glowing orange blue lights, flickering, so I kept my eye on it to double check if i was looking at a plane or star..  IT WAS NOT!  This object moved to the right a little bit, then stopped.  Then back to the left a little,an then again back to the right an came to dead stop!!!  AS I TURNED MY EYES, ATTENTION TO THE RIGHT OF OBJECT A GOOD DISTANCE FROM THE ORB FLASHING OBJECT I SAW A HUGE WHITE FLASH LIGHT TAKE OFF FAST UP INTO SKY (NOT DOWNWOARDS) (NOT STRAIGHT) UP!!! streaming white FLASH of light take off fast..  I could not tell what the white FLASH was because it streamed up into the sky way to fast for my eye to see any craft.. just bright white FLASH.  Then both objects disappeared into the nite.   I HAVE NEVER WITNESSED ANYTHING LIKE THIS IN MARYLAND.. but have always been a believer my adult life. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
