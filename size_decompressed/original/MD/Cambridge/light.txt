A bright orb like craft flying low over Maryland.;2000-11-15 07:00:00;2 minutes;A bright orb like craft flying low over Maryland. Our pet dogs were going crazy.  I walked into the backyard to see what they were barking at.  About 1000 feet away was a glowing orb object going up in the air and then coming down to ground level.  It repeated this around 3 times.  It then flew toward me about 100 feet off the ground. It flew over the house at a moderate speed. The object was probabl about as bright as the sun.  This was at night but it didn't appear to show light on anything else. ((NUFORC Note:  Source is anonymous.  Date may be approximate.  PD));38.5643;-76.0873999999999
