I was sitting at my machine, and out of the side of my eye, I can see very bright lights.   I get up, look outside my window and the colors are seriously bright.   It was moving slowly across the sky.   I thought maybe a plane, but further review told me nope, it wasn't a plane.  The colors were bright and vivid.  I ran to the back of my house, and it was there.  I couldn't chase it, but confirm I saw it! ((NUFORC Note:  We have amended the time above, to reflect a nighttime sighting.
