My cousin and I were around the age of 11 (myself) and 8 years old at time of sighting.  We were playing in at school field while my uncle was coaching a football practice.  When a huge disc shaped sauser with lights hovered over the trees in front of us for about three minutes or so then just shot away quickly I looked at her and she at me and we took off running.  We were young and scared.  My uncle and boys practicing never saw it.  I saw a report on the news tonite and thought I would share our experience.  We're firm believers.   I'm now 50 and I can picture it like it was yesterdayâ€¦ ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));39.0454666666667;-76.9257960784314
