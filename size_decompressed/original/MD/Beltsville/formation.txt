Three flickering lights at first slow and then really fast until gone;2012-12-05 01:12:00;6 minutes;three flickering lights at first slow and then really fast until gone At first I just saw one flickering light far behind the trees.  Then it came out of the trees and there were 3 lights flickering but I realized that it was the same object when the lights were always the same distance away from each other.  At first it was slow, low, and far it regained height and became faster until it was gone ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
