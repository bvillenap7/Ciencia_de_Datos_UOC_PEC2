Line of 4-6 bright white blinking lights in sky.;2013-09-20 19:20:00;30 seconds;Line of 4-6 bright white blinking lights in sky. Driving west in Grasonville, MD @1920 saw what I thought as a large plane moving slow, I thought possibly in distress, with a series of ~4-6 bright flashing white lights from wingtip to wingtip.   My wife, child and I from viewed this from inside our vehicle with the lights positioned directly ahead above the treeline. There were no other colors besides the white lights.  All lights  blinked in unison with a rough spacing of about a second.  Lights appeared to be in perfect horizontal line and were equidistant from each other.  Altitude believed to be approximately 1000-2000’ but that was approximating if it were a plane with lights, which is extremely unlikely.  Radio in vehicle was on and did not hear any airplane/helicopter sounds.  No background shape seen (if one even existed) as the lights were too bright. Lights were bright similar to that of looking at a search beam.  An attempt at following was not successful mainly due to many trees though headed west for about 5-10 minutes hoping to get a glimpse of it. Contacted local sheriff’s department around 2100 EST and was told no other reports of the lights or planes known that were in distress.  Though this occurred seemingly above our neighborhood unfortunately, no one else seemed to see this event.  Posted to our community forum and another local forum and no one else saw anything.  No pictures taken unfortunately as I did not think quickly enough.  Checked online and there were a couple shots people have taken.  The light configuration is similar to this video http://www.ufocasebook.com/2011/videotassiesky.html but the lights that we saw blinked in unison and were very bright white.  In addition, where this person zoomed in with his camera we did not have to at all. Any insight of what I saw would be greatly appreciated.;38.9456;-76.1997000000001
