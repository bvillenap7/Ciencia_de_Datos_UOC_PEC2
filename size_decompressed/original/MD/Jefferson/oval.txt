Oval shaped object sighted hovering over a field;2010-01-29 13:25:00;1-2minutes;Oval shaped object sighted hovering over a field I was driving down a back road in the afternoon when I felt the urge to direct my attention to the left of me towards a field.  My attention was immediately stolen by what looked to be a oval shaped object hovering over the field approximately 200-300ft. in the air (that would be my best guess).  The object was not moving, and was not emitting any lights or sounds, but I could tell the object was shiny due to the fact the sun was reflecting off of the object. As a passed a few trees, and my line of sight was broken, I looked back in the general area only to find the object was gone.  I slowed down my car from  about 30mph to about 15mph and scanned the sky and the fields that I could see, but the object had disappeared. I immediately called a friend of mine and told him what I had saw, and asked another friend or two how I could obtain information pertaining to anyone else reporting  a strange object in the area.  They suggested contacting the county and/or state authorities.  My plan is to contact them in the next day or two and ask about any reports of a ‘low flying aircraft’ in the past week.  This area hasn’t been known to have many UFO sightings to my knowledge, nor have I witnessed anything like this area here before, but I know I’m am now more intrigued than ever to learn, document, and report any strange sighting or occurrences from this area. I have sent a sighting report to the HBCC UFO Research as well with the same information I have provided in this report.;39.3642;-77.5404
