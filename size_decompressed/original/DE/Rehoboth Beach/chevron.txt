Vibrating double chevron travelling at impossible speed southern delaware heading toward washington DC.;2017-10-22 20:50:00;2-3 seconds;Vibrating double chevron travelling at impossible speed southern delaware heading toward washington DC Witness a double chevron shaped formation of vibrating lights.  Each arm had 3 lights (12 total).  Estimated altitude 2 miles.  Traversed 90 degrees of sky in 2-3 seconds, estimated speed 5000-7000 MPH.  Lights were unlike any plane, helicopter, drone or any other type of craft I have ever seen.  The lights vibrated in a manner that made it appear warped, almost fuzzy.   I immediately filed a report with mufon Case number 85712.  Lights appeared to be a silvery/green color, again distorted by warping/vibrating effect.  Object was coming out of the nne and traveled to the south at an angle of about 80 degrees at it zenith to my perspective.  No noise, no trail, no bemas or anything of the sort.;38.721;-75.0752
