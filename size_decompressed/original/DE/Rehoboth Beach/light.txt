bright green oblonged object flying vertical in sky;2006-06-20 22:00:00;20 secs;bright green oblonged object flying vertical in sky During a summer vacation at the beach my wife, my brother, my sister in law, and I witnessed a ufo on our way back from dinner on the night of 6/20/06.  Just after we turned off of rt.1 (coastal highway) onto John J. Williams Hwy. right before we crossed over the bridge at Love Creek we got about a 20 sec. glimpse of an oblonge, saucer-shaped object in the sky right in front of us.  The object was glowing with a bright flourescent green color and had a hazy tail behind it.  It was flying vertical at a high speed and disapeared suddenly.  It was hard to distinguish how high the ufo was due to the dark night sky, but it was definitly below the clouds.  We would love to know if anyonelse witnessed this or has any info. about it.;38.721;-75.0752
Repeated Observation of Red/Orange Flickering Lights off Delaware Coast;2010-08-07 21:30:00;5 minutes;Repeated Observation of Red/Orange Flickering Lights off Delaware Coast Red/orange flickering lights seen clearly from the downtown area near the main firehouse.  The lights were high in the sky and appeared to be south of my observation point.  One was brighter than the other, and they moved from south to north and appeared to hover in the sky.  The lights also appeared to be over the water. The lights flickered, appearing to look like distant campfires or other flames.  (Maybe they were flares?)  I was walking east towards the ocean, and was passing the firehouse when several people out front had already noticed the lights and were discussing what they could be. This is not the first time I have seen these lights.  I never bothered to comment on them, as I thought they had to be from military aircraft due to Dover Air Force Base being nearby.  However, I am seeing them more and more.  In fact, my friend and I joke about them, and when we see them we comment, Our friend is back.;38.721;-75.0752
