Four equidistant white lights forming a diamond shape from the rear of what appeared to be a silver-gray cylinder.;2014-07-26 16:00:00;2-3 seconds;Four equidistant white lights forming a diamond shape from the rear of what appeared to be a silver-gray cylinder. On July 26th, at approximately 4pm DST, my son and I observed four equidistant white lights forming a diamond shape.  These emanated from the rear of what appeared to be a silver-gray cylinder.  The object flew south to north, in an apparent straight line just west of the beach at Rehoboth Beach DE.  It traveled a minimum of 2 lateral miles in the 2-3 seconds we observed it, before disappearing into the clouds. The object was gaining altitude as well but, we were unable to determine at what altitude we first observed it or what the change in altitude may have been. The lights did not appear to be reflections of the sun as, they were a steady bright white for the entire time we observed them, the object was between our position and the sun and the object was observed below the sun on the horizon. We heard no noise and saw nothing that would have identified this as a conventional  aircraft EG: wings, port or starboard lights, white strobe light.
