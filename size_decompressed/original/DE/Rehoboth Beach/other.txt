Odd panel of four orange lights spotted above Atlantic Ocean before quickly fading out.;2008-12-03 21:30:00;7-10 seconds;Odd panel of four orange lights spotted above Atlantic Ocean before quickly fading out. Location: Rehoboth Beach, DE.  At approximately 9:30 pm this evening, I witnessed a series of four square lights above the Atlantic Ocean.  They were quite large and were yellow-orange, reminiscent of the color of a candle flame.  They were evenly spaced with the two outer squares tapering off slightly as if the panel of lights created one round object.  The image caught my eye due to its gravity in size, its odd height above the ocean, and its very closeness to the shoreline.   The sighting lasted approximately seven to ten seconds before fading into the night sky.  However, the lights were apparent when I glanced over the ocean rather than appearing out of nowhere.  The lights remained stationary even while they winked out.   After disappearing, a fellow passenger asked me if I had seen the very thing I described above, proving to me that this was not something to be ignored nor written off as a common plane or boat.;38.721;-75.0752
