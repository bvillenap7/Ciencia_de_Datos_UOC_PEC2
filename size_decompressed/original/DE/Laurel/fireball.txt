We saw two red orange lights in the sky in font of us as we were driving.  I thought them to be planets, as I immediately told my wife.   We drove approximately 1-2 miles watching these lights , and after only driving 1-2 miles we had gained on the two objects as they were now nearly directly beside the car.  We pulled over to listen to see if they were helicopters.  No sound that we could note. The lights we now noticed moving ahead and way from us.   As we were driving west we noticed them moving east, but when we stopped we could tell they were indeed moving northwest, and the only reason they appeared to be moving east is because we were traveling 50 mph and gaining on them, as they must not have been far away.   When we stopped, we watched them for a couple more minutes as they seemed to get smaller/ dimmer.  I believe the were gaining altitude.  Then one flickered a little and went out.  A few second later my life noticed the other do the same and they were gone.;38.558;-75.5585
