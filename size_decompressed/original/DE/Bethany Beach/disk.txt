Yellow lighted large disk soundless over Bethany Beach De;2012-07-14 22:40:00;22:35 - 22:37;Yellow lighted large disk soundless over Bethany Beach De I was heading northbound on Rt 1 in Bethany Beach, DE aprox 5. miles south of the Indian River Inlet Bridge, when a group of 10-14 yellowish lights describing a circle caught my attention.  Its orientation was at about a 45 degree angle from dead staight on.  It was just over the horizion to the right of me apparently about 5 miles away. Its was aprox. the size of my fist held out at arms length.  It was over the Atlantic Ocean as the bay and the ocean are about 100-150 yards away from this highway. As it got closer the 10-14 lights retained a circular shape, and appeared to get bigger.  As it moved closer following the shoreline the object tilted from its top towards me while retaining its general 45 degree orientation to flat on.  At this point I realized that this was a disk shape. It continued to move past on the right until it left my feild of vision. The final size was aprox. 20 &quotfists&quot.  There was no disernable color to the apparent body of the this craftbut it did block out stars behind it as it moved.  There was no sound.  There had to be many other witnesses.;38.5314;-75.0679
