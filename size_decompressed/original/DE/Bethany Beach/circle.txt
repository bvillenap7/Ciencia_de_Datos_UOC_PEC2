I was on boardwalk, the UFOs were located over the ocean, northeast direction. A group of 5 people saw me observing and asked if i knew what it was, i did not, they did not. The UFOs then started to move into a triangular shape, they started to align vertically, but did not totally form a straight line.  The one lowest to the ocean started to fade, then the next up, then the highest one faded last. It was a few hours after it had stopped raining, lots of rain, thunderstorms.;38.5314;-75.0679

Orange circle in sky.;2015-08-13 20:41:00;90 seconds;Orange circle in sky. My brother and I were walking along the boardwalk and noticed a small orange light above us.  We first thought it was a plane but planes didn't give off such a bright orange shade.  It started off coming towards us and ascending.   Then as it seemed as if it was about to come above us it stopped, and ascended until it faded out of sight.  Many people ignored it thinking it was some event.  We watched it the whole way and saw it go straight up into the sky until disappearing into space. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.  PD));38.5314;-75.0679

While on the sand, we took some iphone photos and a video of it until it disappeared about 10:44. I am a retired educator and my husband is a business owner.;38.5314;-75.0679
