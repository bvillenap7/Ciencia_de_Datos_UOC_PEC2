It was about 9 pm it was snowing outside and my wife asked me to go to the store i walked out my front door and looked up to admire the snow fall and as i looked up i saw a funny shaped fire looking object look kind of like a hot air balloon at first i thought i was a plane on fire but it still was maintaining a western course i screamed to my wife to look out the window and i said look up at that and asked what the hell is it. we just stared at it and after a minute it made a funny humming sound and just vanished i looked on the news and internet to see if there was any type of emergency for planes but no report i strongly believe it was an U.F.O;39.5896018691589;-75.6095140186917
