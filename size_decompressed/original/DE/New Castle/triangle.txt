Silent and hovering.;1988-09-30 21:00:00;30 seconds;Silent and hovering Very similar to the Belgium ufo photo, object was hovering low and rotating very slowly. Object appeared to be ascending because as it rotated because the 3 amber/orangish lights got smaller as it went up.  This object was completely silent.   When I witnessed this thing I ran in the house and drew it.  To this day I am puzzled by this event and very interested in the subject.  This absolutely was not a conventional aircraft.   My home was 2 miles away from the New Castle County airport and was not the Osprey.   The time of this event was 8-9 pm and was fully dark so it must have been late fall as I remember it.
