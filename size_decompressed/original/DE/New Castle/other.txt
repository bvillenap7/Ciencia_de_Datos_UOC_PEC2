Oct 1984 at 8:15 am small translucent half dome shaped object;1984-10-15 08:15:00;3-5 minutes;Oct 1984 at 8:15 am small translucent half dome shaped object When I was 22 years old, I was driving to work through a suburban neighborhood around 8:15 am when I saw a gliding translucent half dome shaped object.  It is important to note that the object was not floating in the air it was actually gliding on top of the road.  I remember looking at it and wondering if I was seeing things.   I stopped the car and just watched it glide slowly across the road in front of me.  It was only about 15 feet away from me.  It looked to be maybe 4 feet wide by 3 feet high from the angle I could view it.  It was translucent, but not transparent, sort of like aurora borealis glass, but you couldnâ€™t see through it.   It was perfectly symmetrical and glided very slowly without bumps or stops or starts.  I stayed in the car and I looked around to see if anyone else was witnessing what I was, but no one else was nearby.   The material was so different, and the way the object moved, I have never seen anything else like it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.
