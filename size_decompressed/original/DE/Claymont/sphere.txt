2 spheres side by side traveling west to east over claymont de.;2007-08-28 20:30:00;1sec;2 spheres side by side traveling west to east over claymont de. 2 spheres 1 purple 1 blue traveling very fast west to east. very high in sky i thought at first maybe it was a meteor shower but they were the only ones that went by. a falling star is alone not two side by side. observed from my back deck just looking up at that time. i hope someone can let me know what it was. thank you;39.8044;-75.4649
