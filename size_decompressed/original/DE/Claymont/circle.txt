When we went out the door my son said Mom there's the big dipper  as I looked up a group of 25 circular lit objects appeared where the big dipper was.  The group stopped and hovered together for a minute.  While this was going on a helicopter came from the east and hovered there.  We assumed they saw the objects as we had or that the helicopter had been tracking them.  The objects began to move as a group and headed east.  As they did this the helicopter turned and watched them go.  Then another group of about 25 appeared and appeared to stop at about the same place  as we watched a third group came along.  When they reached the stopped group  they all traveled the same path the first group did.  After that we did not see any more.;39.8044;-75.4649

Three sets of lights orbiting around three centers.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect advertising lights.  PD));2017-10-06 20:30:00;>1 hour;Three sets of lights orbiting around three centers While going for my nightly walk, in the sky I noticed three sets of four lights in the clouds (12 lights total).  The lights moved in a clockwise circular pattern, drifted out to a fixed perimeter, and drifted into the center of the circular formation.  There were three sets, two of which, when at their fullest 'bloom' touched each other.  The other seemed to be separated, from the group. I was alone on my walk, but there were other people in the area.  I did not ask them if they noticed the lights, because my neighborhood is not always the safest place.;39.8044;-75.4649
