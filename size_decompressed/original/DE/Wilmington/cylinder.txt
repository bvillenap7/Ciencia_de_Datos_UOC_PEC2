Assumed it was a plane banking very hard to the north although it was flying very low and made no sound.  Happened for a few seconds and then lost it as came out of the woods onto a main road.  This is a common drive for me at this time of night and I have never seen these lights before.;39.7550792122539;-75.5699094091904
