Light over General Motors plant;2005-04-19 21:00:00;30 seconds;Light over General Motors plant I was out doing carts for Acme Markets in Delaware when I looked up over the GM plant and saw a plane. Nothing unusual there until I spoted a light flying west away from the plant and it started out as a green light.  I heard no sound as the light switched from green to pink to amber as it continued east toward Elsmere, it proceeded to shoot up, hover and then accelerate to the west at a high rate of speed where I lost it.;39.7550792122539;-75.5699094091904
2 bright light shooting across the sky and disappeared in Pike Creek, DE;2012-01-20 05:15:00;2-3 minutes;2 bright light shooting across the sky and disappeared in Pike Creek, DE This happened approximately around 5:15 am.  I was walking out of my apartment building and happen to look up at the sky.  The moon was in a crescent shape to my right.  As I looked at the moon, I noticed out the corner of my left eye, what looked to be an airplane moving very fast. The only difference was there were no flashing lights and it was low, bright, white light flying low enough that if it was an airplane, I could’ve made out the shape.   As I followed the light across the sky, I noticed another one coming from the other direction (my right).  It looked like they were going to hit each other.  Once they got close enough to each other, they began to shift in the same direction side by side across the sky.  Then they just shot straight up in the air (VERY FAST!) still side by side and they disappeared!   I was in shock and still am!  I don’t know what to believe???  I only see these types of things on TV or movies.  My question is, did anyone else happen to witness this?;39.7550792122539;-75.5699094091904
Green streaking light at low altitude.;2014-01-31 21:00:00;2 seconds;Green streaking light at low altitude. Greenish light moving across the sky.  Light was very bright and could not be missed if you were looking in the general direction.  Object was moving extremely fast and seemed to be a low altitude.  Object appeared for approx. 2 seconds and disappeared.  No sound came from object.  Object was observed by two people.  One person works for an accounting office, the other works as a corporate trainer.;39.7550792122539;-75.5699094091904
Lots of pulsing red lights flying in formation, against the wind, south of the Philadelphia metro area;2014-10-12 20:05:00;5-7 minutes;Lots of pulsing red lights flying in formation, against the wind, south of the Philadelphia metro area On Sunday October 12th, 2014, a little after 8pm EST, my husband had gone outside to turn off the lights in our detached garage.  He immediately shouted back to me to come outside and bring the camera – his tone was urgent. I fumbled for a moment getting the camera, and when I stepped out our back door I was aghast!  The sky to the north of our home was lit up like a Christmas tree with a large cluster of red pulsating lights that were flying in formation from east to west.  I set the camera to video and started filming.  I was standing on the top step and my husband was below me, and to my left, at ground level. He told me to step down for a better viewpoint.  I had difficulty doing so because I couldn’t see the stairs in the dark.  He helped me down, and I filmed all the while.  The video jiggles around during that time. The sight of these lights was startling.  The lights pulsed from a dim glowing orange red to a strong, deep red.  While they moved in one large formation, each light was variable enough in its speed and pulsing that they appeared to be individual crafts, as opposed to many lights on one large craft.  I estimate there were between 25 and 50 crafts.  They moved in unison, but did not pulse in unison.  The visual effect was scintillating, like Christmas tree lights that fade in and out rapidly and randomly.  They moved slower than the average airplane, and they made no noise. My husband ran inside to grab the phone during the sighting.  He intended to call our next door neighbor so there would be another witness.  As he did so, the lights began to fade out and disappear.  I called to him that they were disappearing!  He abandoned the phone and returned outside to catch the last of the crafts. There were some stragglers that followed after the large formation was gone. These later craft were slightly different from the others they flew more in a single file line than in a cluster, they seemed to be larger lights than the others and the color was more orange. While their color also pulsed, it seemed slower and stronger than the formation lights. I tried zooming in on one of these craft. My SD card ran out of space during filming and I had to run inside and change to a new card. I resumed filming on the new card. I also tried to zoom in and take some still photos, but the shutter speed was too long for a hand held shot. (I got photos of smeared lights). At some point during the sighting, I checked my watch and the time was 8:10pm. Upon reviewing the videos, the red craft are not as visible in the film as they were to the naked eye. The brighter ones appear in the video, but the camera didn’t capture them all the sky was shimmering with them! Also, reviewing the video I noticed some larger, more orangeish craft on the upper right side. These look like those other craft that came afterwards – but they appear to be flanking the mass of red sparklers.  I didn’t realize this until watching the video. In my video, you can hear the traffic from I-495, which is nearby. There is no sound to the crafts that I could discern live, or in my video. I could not discern a shape to the crafts with my naked eye. To my view, I could only see them as lights. The weather conditions at the time of the event were chilly with a partly cloudy sky. The patchy clouds were semi-transparent, low, feathery type. The clear parts of the sky were clear enough to see stars. I estimate the temperature was about 55-60 degrees. NOAA wind maps indicate winds from the south at 3000’ and from the west at 6000’ this evening. I called our local police station to ask if anyone had reported some unusual lights, and the trooper replied that they did have a man come in around 10pm to report some unusual lights in the sky.  I also called the Philadelphia Airport to learn if they had any explanation for strange lights this evening, such as an air show, or other events involving flying objects, etc.  They said they would normally be informed of these kinds of events, but they have no such events on their calendar for this evening. My background: I’m 49 years old and have worked in banking most of my working life. I enjoy the night sky, sometimes with a telescope, but usually with the naked eye. While I have little knowledge of airplanes, I have lived under the landing pattern of the Philadelphia Airport all of my life. I see planes in the night sky all the time – I’ve never seen anything like these lights.;39.7550792122539;-75.5699094091904
Cluster of orange/red pulsating lights vicinity of Philadelphia Airport;2014-10-12 20:05:00;~10 minutes;Cluster of orange/red pulsating lights vicinity of Philadelphia Airport From our back porch, through a clear, unobstructed opening in the trees that faces north northeast I saw a tight cluster of approximately 50 or more (difficult to count) blinking orange to reddish lights. They were in a loose cluster formation traveling east to west, much slower than an airplane and without any sound.  The sky was clear to the north with high, thin clouds coming in from the south.  The lights were below the clouds but appeared very high. There were also lights from a plane traveling north, above the clouds and above the cluster, but from my viewpoint ‘through’ the cluster. The wind was light and the direction the lights were moving seemed to contradict the wind and the cloud movement. I know winds can vary with altitude, and I do not know how high these lights were flying. Having seen a fireball recently, I stopped to consider what I was seeing and realized it was not fireball, fireworks or anything else that I’d ever seen before.  I watched th! em for several seconds, thinking they would quickly vanish, and when they didn’t, I called my wife and asked her to bring the camera.  There is over 5 minutes of video that document most of what we saw.  What they looked like to me were electrically generated lights, not flame, pulsing from a very bright orange to a not so bright red and back again. No way was it flame! They pulsed at about 1 second intervals, not in unison. The lights were moving at about the same speed and direction with some slight variation. There seemed to be two types – one type was definitely brighter than the other type.  I went inside to get the phone to call our neighbor but stopped, grabbed my binoculars instead and returned when my wife said the lights were disappearing. The way they were disappearing was just to kind of fade out. No loss in altitude. Each one just fizzling out where it stood, bunches at a time until the only ones that were left were a handful of the brighter ones. As those last ones diminished, a few more of the brighter type drifted into view from the east. The position of our house and a large holly tree prevented us from seeing where they originated, they just drifted into our small field of view and every single one of them vanished within our sight after crossing our small field of view.  A couple at a time, then one at a time, with longer spaces in between, and then they were done. The last one seemed to change direction after crossing the opening in the sky. It seemed to move further away to the north before vanishing.  When I tried looking at them with my binoculars and it appeared that the orange light was coming from the bottom of the object and the red light was coming from the top. It also appeared that they went a little faster when the red light was glowing, and slower when the orange light was glowing, though that could have been an illusion. I’d like to think this could be explained as being Chinese lanterns or something of the sort, but the intensity of the electric light, their height, the fact that they remained in a such tight formation, and that they vanished so simultaneously, make it difficult to explain.  I’ve lived my entire 50+ years under the flight path of Philadelphia International Airport. I’ve worked outdoors all my life. I intentionally spend a lot of my leisure time looking at the sky, day and night, and enjoying the variety of light displays, natural and manmade.  This is a very urban area and it’s not uncommon to see distant fireworks or balloons from a party. What I saw on this date was something I’ve never seen before – and I’m just amazed.;39.7550792122539;-75.5699094091904
Silent aircraft over Wilmington/Pike Creek.;2015-10-23 05:00:00;3-4 minutes;Silent aircraft over Wilmington/Pike Creek. At about 5 am I observed a white circular light in the southwest sky.  At first it looked like a very large, very bright star, but I noticed it was moving.  It was so early in the morning that it was still very quiet outside – no birds chirping, no traffic noise.  I watched the object move from the southwest to the northeast over the Pike Creek area.  It was not a plane or a helicopter.  It made absolutely no sound at all, even as it passed over my house.  It moved very slowly, and low enough in the sky that as it moved over my house I could see not just the circular white light but also red flashing lights.  Many planes fly over this area.  I’ve never experienced any aircraft that could do so without making a single sound – as if it was engine-less and just gliding slowly across the sky.

Two tiny lights become one, then fade away slowly.;2019-10-29 23:00:00;2 minutes;Two tiny lights become one, then fade away slowly. So me and my wife usually smoke cigarettes on our back patio before going to bed. Being such a chilly night, we wrapped our arms around each other. We were having a normal conversation when I looked up to see if I could see the stars. Due to wear we live, some nights you can, some nights you can't. My wife is looking the opposite direction I am when she say's, Look a shooting star. I turned, looked where she was pointing, when I said That's no star! It was moving really fast, then stopped. It stayed in one spot for a good two seconds, when I second object merged with the first, and they began to glow super bright, white light. It dimmed slowly for about a second, then evaporated as if it was getting smaller. It's then we realized it was moving away from us, not dimming. Almost as if it was heading into space. I pulled my phone out, and got a good couple seconds of it. Wish I had it out the whole time, because two objects became one, ! but the video only show's just the one bright light.;39.7550792122539;-75.5699094091904

This object first appeared to be a bright white star or planet. After staring at it from my window for about 3 seconds, the object suddenly was a bit lower and to the left. Now appearing as a less bright, red light. This sudden change in location as a red light happened about 6 times within 10 seconds then disappeared. The object seemed to be far away. Movements were within same vicinity but could of been up to a mile apart, with no pattern. Each change in location followed up with a still pause.;39.7550792122539;-75.5699094091904
