Fireballs (n=2) Moving in a southwest to north direction.;2014-07-10 22:00:00;15 minutes;Fireballs (n=2) Moving in a southwest to north direction. The first ball came from a southwest direction was moving slightly slower than a plane, which was very bright at first, similar to a ball of fire.  What was most notable was that there was “drippings” or embers of fire or what have you from the bottom of the object.  The object then slowed down considerably and continued on its northerly path with the fireball decreasing in size until it completely dissipated. The second object moved in a relatively similar direction but instead of continuing the same directional course as the first fireball, the second moved upwards in the sky until it slowed to a halt and dissipated. It should be noted, that there was no noise, smoke, or trails associated with these objects.  To the best of the observers knowledge fireworks were not at play nor could the objects be attributed to flares.;39.7550792122539;-75.5699094091904
Saw 2 slow moving fireball type orbs heading South over Kirkwood hwy. while at gas station.;2014-08-03 20:00:00;1-2 minutes;Saw 2 slow moving fireball type orbs heading South over Kirkwood hwy. while at gas station. My fiancee and I were heading North on Rt. 7 (Limestone Road) just south of Rt. 2 (Kirkwood Highway).  We pulled into the Shell gas station located at the 7/2 intersection. As we pulled up to the pump and he got out, I looked out towards the strip mall across rt. 2 where A.C. Moore and Kohl's is, and I saw what looked like 2 glowing balls of fire.  They were perfectly round, fairly large, and flickered just like a candle flame would.  It was not an on off twinkling that you see from airplanes.  They were moving slowly from the North to the South, the second ball seemed to moving just slightly faster then the first, as the gap between the 2 seemed to be shrinking.  Not sure if that was because of the angle I was seeing them from or not. I sat there watching them until they disappeared over the awning of the gas station.

We saw many fireballs in a somewhat triangular formation, falling from the sky. Looked like shooting stars in slow motion, blinking off and on.  After a somewhat free fall, they then began to slow down and even hover, before disappearing beyond tree line.;39.7550792122539;-75.5699094091904
