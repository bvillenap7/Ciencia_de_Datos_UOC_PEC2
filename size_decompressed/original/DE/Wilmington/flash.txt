UFO object in the southwest sky as I was at Silverside rd and Concord POike at 13:00 on Friday October 7, 2011;2011-10-07 13:00:00;3-4 minutes;UFO object in the southwest sky as I was at Silverside rd and Concord POike at 13:00 on Friday October 7, 2011 Today's date is October 7, 2011. I was at Silverside Rd and Concord Pike in Wilmington, Delaware getting into my car at 13:00 when I looked up into the southwest clear blue sky and noticed something hovering and flashing in the sky.  I watched to see if it was a helocopter but it wasn't a copter or a plane.   I saw a plane on approach to Phl airport and the plane was aprox. 4000-5000 feet in the air and this UFO object was about 10,000 feet not moving in any one direction I couldn't hear any sound and it just seem to flash white light.  There was nothing in the sky and I was looking almost directly up so it was not a reflection.  I looked away and then could not locate the object as I searched to see if I could locate it again.;39.7550792122539;-75.5699094091904
