Moon sized object grew to fill entire sky, then disappeared;1969-10-15 18:30:00;1 minute;Moon sized object grew to fill entire sky, then disappeared In October 1969 I was riding my bike home from a friends house after having dinner there, so I know the time was around 6 or 7PM…shortly after total darkness.  The exact day of the month I can not recall. I happened to look up at the sky as I was riding and saw what I first thought was the moon, but then noticed it seemed brighter and orange-ish in color…and was featureless. (no dark spots or “man in the moon”)  Almost immediately  it grew until it filled the entire sky, then disappeared completely. The effect was like the moon was falling and I remember ducking! I stopped riding and continued to watch the sky, wondering what I had seen. Suddenly it was back…in the same position as the first time, only a green-ish color this time. Again it quickly grew until it filled the whole sky, then disappeared again just like before. I was a bit scared at this point (I was 14 at the time) and rode home quickly, telling my mother what I had seen as soon as I got in the house. About 10 minutes later a report came over the radio (local AM station) saying that “strange lights you may have seen in the sky” were “atmospheric testing”. At that time you accepted what you heard on radio or TV as fact, so case closed. Later in life I often wondered what sort of “atmospheric testing” it could have been and why I had never heard anything more about it. I have since searched the internet extensively and can find no mention of any type of testing that could produce this sort of phenomena,  I was tempted to make this report after reading a very similar report dated 2/20/70 in Ft. Dix, NJ, which is only about 60 miles from my sighting location in Wilmington, DE. The NJ report says “date approximate” so I wonder if their sighting could have actually been 4 months earlier, as I’m fairly certain of the month and year. I would love to hear if anyone else witnessed this as the Ft Dix report is the only other mention of this I can find anywhere!

Circular Shadow seen above Wilmington De on 6-10-01;2001-06-10 03:15:00;10 seconds;Circular Shadow seen above Wilmington De on 6-10-01 OK I know this sounds stupid, in fact im 24 and could hardly believe it myself. All i will say as yesterday in the Wilmington, DE area i was laying outside my pool. Staring into the sky for no apparent reason other then to look at the clouds that were passing by. The clouds had covered the sun.  I was staring into the sun area as i had sunglasses on. I stared for about 10 minutes up at the clouds not looking for UFOs blah blah. I live right near Philadelphia airport and have seen many airplanes etc and hear engines all the time. This, this was different, I couldnt believe my eyes.  There amongst the clouds was a circular shape. 5 inches in diameter at least 12000 feet in the air.  The clouds were high yesterday the ones that we had.  There was no airport takeoffs or landings at the time i saw this object. Is kind of wierd but for about 10 minutes there was no jet engines nothing. In the clouds i could see the circular shadow of an object curving toward the thicker clouds.  I started pointing up to the sky, my fiance was next to me as well as about 10-12 other people. I couldnt say anything i just pointed in awe.  The clouds were thicker toward the philly area and that was when it took off into the thicker clouds.  No engine noise no nothing.  I know what i saw. Be it a ufo or hi tech govt vehicle is was nothing of this planet in my honest opinion.  I dont know what it was but i do know it had perfect symetrical form from where i was laying it was about 5 inches in diameter it had to be at least 10000 feet in the air, as the clouds were super hi yesterday.  And that is my story.  Next thing i know i couldnt stop thinking of it all day.  I have no photographs i have no video only my words to describe it. Believe or dont i dont really care. Im writing this cause I saw something yesterday. Something that changed my views of the world and what is out there. Something is and its not human. I saw it with my own eyes.;39.7550792122539;-75.5699094091904

8 fireballs following same path traveled northeast.;2014-10-25 23:45:00;20 minutes;8 fireballs following same path traveled northeast At around 11:45pm, what I would describe as a fireball, came from over the trees (south) and was heading northeast.  It appeared to be on fire but with no trail/tail.  It would occasionally spark with the sparks fading almost immediately.  After the fireball was out of view, another followed in the EXACT SAME PATH. 8 of these fireballs traveled in the same direction over a period of about 20 minutes.  There were about 2 minutes between each one. They were completely silent and were about 1500 feet off the ground traveling at about 100-150mph.  My roommate and 4 of my neighbors witnessed the same thing.   We have multiple videos of this.;39.7550792122539;-75.5699094091904
Four objects noticed way up in the sky.  ((anonymous report));2016-09-25 15:49:00;30;Four objects noticed way up in the sky. Today, I noticed four objects moving to south west direction.  Three in the front, and one in back. It doesn't looked like birds, because it's way up int he sky and looked in silver color. It doesn't looked like weather balloon, cause all moving in same direction at same speed.  And doesn't looked like fighter planes, caused it stopped for a while and stayed in one place. It was so tiny, looked like a stars moving.  And sure it's not drone cause it was flying way up in the sky and could see some flights flying way down compared to the objects.  I tried to record it from my iphone, nothing was visible through the phone as the objects were so tiny. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
