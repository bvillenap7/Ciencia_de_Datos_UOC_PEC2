We saw a missile type object shooting into the air, north of Wilmington, while preparing for our shift at work, all three of us thought we were firing a missile, we ran inside to check the news after the object dissipated to see if there was any others that seen it. after scouring the internet we didn't see any launches scheduled for today so we decided to post it here and see if anyone had any knowledge about this object.;39.7550792122539;-75.5699094091904
