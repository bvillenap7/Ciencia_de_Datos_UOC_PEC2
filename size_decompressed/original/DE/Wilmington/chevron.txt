Object then very slowly moved away and out of sight.   It was relatively large and  low flying.  Dark exterior that blended in with the night sky and made it difficult to see exact outline.  Multiple cars pulled over to look at the object.  Possible military stealth plane? ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect an evening sighting, and have amended the time above, to reflect our suspicion.  However, source of report provided defective contact information, so we are unable to verify the time.  Possible hoax??  PD));39.7550792122539;-75.5699094091904
