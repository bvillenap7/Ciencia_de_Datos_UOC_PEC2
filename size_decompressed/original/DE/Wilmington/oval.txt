On our walk, I looked just above the tree line and suddenly a bright sparkling craft came flying by at fast speeds.  It was as beautiful as a firework sparkler.   Then after, I told my boyfriend to look twice, then it vanishes.  Later something reappeared in the same area where it disappeared.  Then a bright orange light hovers up and down for 30+ minutes.   There is a oil refinery in the area and you can see it in winter through the trees.   Maybe the aliens are using our resources.;39.7550792122539;-75.5699094091904
