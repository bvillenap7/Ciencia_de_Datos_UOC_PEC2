I observed a metallic sphere travelling west to east below cloud level.;2004-08-08 15:20:00;15 sec.;I observed a metallic sphere travelling west to east below cloud level. I was at the playground with my two boys when I happened to look up ( facing roughly South) and spot a sphere in the sky.  My first thought was a child's mylar balloon.  The problem was that it travelled against the wind, went very fast and travelled in a perfectly straight line.  It was below the clouds because it was silhouetted against them when it passed by.  When it was against the blue sky it was still visible, but not as clearly as when it was passing in front and under a cloud.  It did not change shape or make any noise.  It appeared solid and metallic.  I called it to the attention of my two boys (age 10 and 8) but they failed to spot it before it went out of sight.  I am a former Army Captain,and I have a private pilot's license (not current).;39.7550792122539;-75.5699094091904
Brilliant sphere floats above the Wilmington Suburbs.;2006-04-15 17:15:00;1 minute;Brilliant sphere floats above the Wilmington Suburbs. My son and I were on our way to his guitar lesson in Wilmington, Delaware.  We stopped for a traffic light in order to go Soutg on US-202.  As we waited for the light, both our eyes were caught by the gleam of an object that was about the size of a pea held at arms length, and at about 60 degrees above the horizon.  The object was at least several miles up in the atmosphere, as it was blocked out momentarily by clouds.  We were stopped, and we had the chimney of a house across the street as a point of reference.  The brilliant orb was suspended motionless, and then began to drift slowly in a south-westerly direction.  After about a minute, it took offlike a bullet in the same direction, disappearing from sight.  An amazing sighting!;39.7550792122539;-75.5699094091904
3 objects interacting over DE City;2006-08-09 15:00:00;15 min;3 objects interacting over DE City A Co-worker and I observed 3 objects rotating around one another at first,and then fly off in seperate directions.1 blue sphere-shaped craft,1 rectangular craft that seemed to be going end-over-end as it hovered and then disappeared,and 1 small black disk shaped craft that moved rapidly eastward after about 10 minutes interacting w/ the other objects.Blue sphere hovered above and then below the clouds,in and out of sight,for a few minutes after other objects left.It finally ascended out of view upon arrival of military helicopter,possibly a Blackhawk from Dover AFB.;39.7550792122539;-75.5699094091904
Light sphere seen, exactly the same as the one in the British Police Helicopter footage.;2008-05-14 22:00:00;4 seconds;Light sphere seen, exactly the same as the one in the British Police Helicopter footage. I frequently go to my back deck to smoke a cigarette before bed.  On this occaision, I saw a ball of light cross the sky at a high rate of speed.  It took about four seconds to travel from the southern horizon to the northern horizon (and it was very dark out).  There was no noise that I could hear.  Estimated altitude, about 5,000 feet.  I know this because I live near Philadelphia Airport.  It usually takes an aircraft about a full minute to travel from horizon to horizon, and they only go east-west out of PHL.  I was content to go to sleep knowing I had seen an Angel or a UFO, and not bother telling anyone, until I saw the footage of the British Police Helicopter.  The ball of light in the night shot is exactly what I saw.  Absolutely no question at all. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

A quick moving green glowing ball seen while driving.;2010-03-19 22:00:00;Approx. 3 seconds;A quick moving green glowing ball seen while driving. My friend and I were driving home through a suburban area and we saw a glowing green ball move quickly across the sky.  The ball was moving very quickly and was in and out of your sight within 3 seconds.  We thought it might have been a reflection off of the windshield but the speed and direction of the ball lead us to rule out this possibility.

Four Bright Orange Sheres appear twice with 5 minutes seen by neighbors in Delaware;2012-07-25 22:15:00;20 seconds;Four Bright Orange Sheres appear twice with 5 minutes seen by neighbors in Delaware On July 27, 2012, approximately 10:15 pm EST, I MaryLee Frederick, saw four spheres, orange in color in two formations side by side.  They appeared in the north sky and were four times the size of a helicopter light in the night sky.  They floated acrossed the sky like an air balloon for approximately 30 to 60 seconds and one by one fizzled out.  Then about 5 minutes later they appeared again near the same location and were more faint this time and last only 20 to 30 seconds and fizzled out again.  They were three witnesses on the first sighting and then three witnesses on the second sighting.;39.7550792122539;-75.5699094091904
