In each corner there was a bright white light. each light blinked  in turn. one blinking after the other. The obeject just seemed to hover there. You could here a very faint humming sound. And there seemed to be a little mist or haze like around it. We didn't know what to think it could be. After a while in one corner there was 2 lights that shone, one bright white and the other was bright red. They flashed as the object slowly started to move away, then in a bright flash of light it was gone. And there was a small trail of light left behind but then it soon faded.;39.7550792122539;-75.5699094091904

Weird Lights;2006-05-08 23:00:00;10 Minutes;Weird Lights I was driving home from work and I spotted these two lights.  At first I thought they were planes in a holding pattern. As I got closer, another light appeared and they appeared to fly in formation. As I took a left turn onto Lancaster Pike, these three lights flew fast over Silverbrook Cemetary and headed into the Town of Elsmere. I lost sight of them over the trees until I got onto Kirkwood Hwy. They flew over the Elsmere Bridge and into the City of Wilmington where I lost sight of them. I called a friend of mine and he also spotted them over Alban Park on Maryland Ave outside of Wilmington with 2 USAF Trucks following them.;39.7550792122539;-75.5699094091904
Triangular lights seen over Wilmington, DE, heading towards New Castle along 13;2015-07-21 22:00:00;30 seconds;Triangular lights seen over Wilmington DE heading towards New Castle along 13 As we sat at the traffic light at the intersection of route 13 and Rodgers road facing DuPont highway, we witnessed a triangular craft hovering about 300 yards in front of us and extremely low to the ground.  As soon as the light turned green, the craft began to move forward towards us then made a right turn heading south.   After the craft began heading south it with vanished or the lights went out but it was no longer visible.  The object was silent and appeared to be transparent or of a material that did not reflect light.  There were 3 White lights forming a triangle and one red flashing/blinking light.   This was approximately 5-10 miles from the New Castle Airport but it was definitely not an airplane or helicopter.;39.7550792122539;-75.5699094091904
