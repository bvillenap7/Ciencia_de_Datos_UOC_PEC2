Between the trees to the northwest of me I saw what appeared to be a shiny silver, egg shaped craft. It appeared to be hovering directly over Branmar shopping center, probably 200 or 300 feet in the air. Each time there was a clearing the trees I could see the object. The trees only covered the object for a few seconds at a time. After about 5 minutes my view was again blocked by the trees. Once I reached a clearing, again after only several seconds of obscured vision, the object was gone with no trace of which direction it went.  About two weeks later, again while driving, on southbound I-95 just before the exit for route 273 into Newark, Delaware I saw an object that appeared identical. It, again, appeared to simply be hovering over the area near Bear, Delaware. I had an unobscured view this time. I watched very intently as I drove (dangerous? maybe a little). After watching it for a minute or two it the object seemed to disappear into nothing. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));39.7550792122539;-75.5699094091904
