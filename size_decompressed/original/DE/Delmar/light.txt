My sister had and I had just left a toy auction in the tiny Delaware town of Delmar and were heading north on Alt. Route 13 toward Laurel (DE). As I was driving, I looked up at the sky and couldn't believe what I saw. There were six bright blue lights evenly spaced across the sky. Directly below the blue lights in the same perfect straight formation were six red lights. Needless to say, I called for my sister to look up. At that moment, the six red lights shot green lights up at the blue lights in perfect synchronization. We were speechless, and I know our mouths were hanging wide open! Then, just as quickly as they seemed to have appeared, the lights disappeared from view. When I got home, I called the DE State Police. Whoever answered the phone seemed agitated that I had called, but did tell me that a jet had been sent from Dover Air Force Base to investigate, and that there had been no word as yet as to what - if anything - had been discovered (Obviously others had seen what we had!). I never heard another word about the event, and my sister and I rarely talk about it!?. NOTE: (1) The lights were the three colors described, but the red and blue lights could have been reversed, (2) I have experienced other sightings, one several years earlier was even more profound than this one. I'll report on it at a later date. Thank you. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));38.4586;-75.5666444444445
