Walking dogs, every night. Looked above tree line due to large bright lights coming towards us.  At first, there was a huge triangle of lights, very big and bright.  Then, the form changed into 3 huge, impressive entities. NO SOUND, GLIDING across the sky, at times, hovering very low.  Each of the objects were top to bottom, if you will.  Imagine a long 2 X 4 piece of lumber, the smaller end at the top and the longer part being vertical.  HUGE glowing, impressive bright lights on each one.  After they were side by side, slowly, silently, all 3, one at a time started to leave.  When each one left, alone, it turned ever so slighly as to expose the outline of the object from the lights exposing the magnitude of the size of each one.  Then each one left exactly same way.
