Small fireball over Delaware coast;2009-11-27 18:59:00;momentary;Small fireball over Delaware coast From: Lewes, DE (19958) Time: 6:59 PM Friday, November 27, 2009   The following is not a report of any unusual phenomenon, but rather of a fireball, moving (roughly) east to west.  The fireball was bright, the blue-white color of a halogen light, diameter of a Venus-sized point, and moved in a high arc from about 45 degrees (when it came into view) above the horizon toward the ground.  The viewing conditions were mostly clear, some clouds, some moonlight.  I would be interested to see if other reports of a similar sighting are posted.
