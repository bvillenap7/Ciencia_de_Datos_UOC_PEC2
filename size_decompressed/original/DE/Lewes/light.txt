They did not move, remaining stationary for approx. 45 seconds, and then faded away, as if turning down a dimmer switch.  A few seconds later, the same formation appeared in the opposite quadrent of the sky, remained lit for about 45 seconds, and again dimmed.  The distance between the two points would have been far too great to have been traversed by a conventional craft.  Shortly after the second appearence, a formation of 8 US figther jets approached the area where the lights had appeared.;38.7332;-75.1833
Radio changing and light circling car;2005-11-29 17:30:00;Short;Radio changing and light circling car I was driving home from work as usual, when the radio changed. I changed the station back, but it changed again. I decided to turn off the radio, and as I reached for it I saw a brilliant white light out of the corner of my eye. I looked over in shock and saw 6 streams of light, shooting around my car. I promptly sped up and they flew ahead of me. Once they were out of sight, the radio came back on by itself.;38.7332;-75.1833

Bright blue light moving horizontally.;2013-11-28 20:30:00;5-10 seconds;Bright blue light moving horizontally. Bright blue light that moved really fast horizontally from left to right in a matter of seconds.  Appeared suddenly, and then disappeared.  Looked like middle altitude, not as high as the planes, but not extremely low either.  Could not have been a meteorite because no angle, just moved in a straight line horizontally.  Compared to the planes that were in the sky, must have been moving 100 times as .;38.7332;-75.1833

Is this explainable?;2021-03-03 18:34:00;?;Is this explainable? Sending this for your opinion.   A neighbor saw this and took the pics.   I have no idea what she saw and she doesn't know either.   I thought that you guys have more than enough experience to take a look.   It was about 1/2 hour after sunset and it appears to moving & the white lights in the upper right are reflections from her car windshield.   If you have an interest in this let me know and I'll see if she is willing to follow up with you. Thanks  ((name deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  We probably would have followed upâ€¦but source of report provides no contact information!!!  PD));38.7332;-75.1833
