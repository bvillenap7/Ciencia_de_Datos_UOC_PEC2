Dim horizontal lights in isosceles triangle shape flying East to West over Lewes, DE;2012-11-01 05:56:00;4 seconds;Dim horizontal lights in isoceles triangle shape flying East to West over Lewes, DE Object flying East to West. Flew between moon and Earth.  Hard to tell size versus proximity. Three horizontal (based on forward flying direction) rows of lights.  Each row approximately the 1.5 to two times the width of a normal aircraft.  May have been a row of 4-5 very dim lights - yellowish in color.  If even lights...could have been illuminated by moon, because once out of range of the moon, I could not see.  Caught moving object while gazing up and took a second for my sight to lock in - was then able to track for about 4 seconds.  Would assume low-flying object due to speed (length of time) at which it traversed my line of sight. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
