Metal colored sphere with light panel on bottom and lights flashed on and off in a pattern!  ((anonymous));2016-04-21 20:40:00;10 minutes;Metal colored sphere with light panel on bottom and lights flashed on and off in a pattern! Looking out my front window, and saw what looked like a metal, sphere shaped aircraft in the sky with a large panel of small lights on the bottom that flashed on and off in a pattern.  Lights were white.  Moved slowly and made no noise I could hear from ground.  Aircraft was somewhat low to the ground.

Red fiery round object in sky;2020-10-02 21:18:00;5 minutes;Red fiery round object in sky I was on my porch that faces south in line with Bethany Beach and I noticed this big object that was glowing fiery red.  At first glance, I thought it was a comet or something. It was moving slowly with a trail of red and it looked like a huge ball of red fire.  I tried to take pictures but it would fully focus.  I ran inside and yelled at my roommates  (2 of them) to come outside and when we returned, it was much smaller light coming from the object like it dimmed down and then at one point it disappeared and then came back (we could only see the light from it...it seemed further away now).  After a little bit we just could see it anymore from the angle of our porch.;38.7332;-75.1833
