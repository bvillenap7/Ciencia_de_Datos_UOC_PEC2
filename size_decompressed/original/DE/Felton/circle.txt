Saw bright round light coming from the Northeast heading towards my home while I was out in the evening on my front porch.  I thought at first it was an airplane however, it seemed brighter, and didn't have the usual blinking wing lights, just one bright white circular ball.  It didn't make any noise at all, when it started to crest over where I was standing going over me, I look straight up and again couldn't see any other light but one bright white light.  It then went over my home.  I ran inside and screamed for my family to look out back with me, my kids came running out to the back and I couldn't believe my eyes cause in just a few seconds it changed from one bright white light to now two orange round lights, one behind the other, then in an instant the front orange light changed to a blinking red light heading northwest.;39.0225;-75.5925
