Formation of 4 aircrafts with glowing underbelly flying low and towards Atlantic Ocean;2012-01-13 23:29:00;15 seconds;Formation of 4 aircrafts with glowing underbelly flying low and towards Atlantic Ocean Were on the deck when I looked at the sky at the stars and saw what I thought was a constellation before realizing they were moving.   Told my friend to look up, at which point we realized they were actually 4 separate aircraft gliding at slow speeds, South East, towards the Atlantic Ocean.  They separated into pairs, two switched places, and they seemed to disappear (we believe they flew into thick clouds as it was an overly cloudy night). The aircraft resembled planes, in the sense that it appeared they had wings.  The underbelly of each aircraft was glowing, completely lit up with a bluish light and they made no audible sound.  There were no navigation lights, no blinking light like planes usually have when flying at night, and they were flying substantially lower than the couple other planes we saw in other places in the sky. I have no idea what they were but my friend and I dismissed them as stealth jets flying night training missions or something because we are within 50 miles of Dover AFB and have heard they sometimes perform training up and down the coast.  The only thing I can say for sure is that I have never seen anything like it and it certainly was a sight to see.
