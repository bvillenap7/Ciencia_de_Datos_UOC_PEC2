Bright Aircraft Emitted Sparks and Disappeared.;2013-11-19 20:18:00;5 minutes;Bright Aircraft Emitted Sparks and Disappeared. Was standing outside, saw a bright reddish-orange object in the sky moving way too slowly to be a plane, then it flamed/flashed bright reddish-orange, what looked like sparks were emitted, and sped up at which point I called my friend out to look at it.  We watched it travel a short distance across the sky, flash brightly again, emit sparks, then change directions and begin going East towards the ocean at which point it appeared to get smaller and smaller until it disappeared completely.   Second one we saw tonight, first one was only seen by my friend and was a few miles from where this was seen.
