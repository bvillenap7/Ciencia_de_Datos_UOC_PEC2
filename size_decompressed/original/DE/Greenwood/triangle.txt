Hovering aircraft with orange lights;2018-12-07 19:30:00;3 minutes;Hovering aircraft with orange lights We got home from eating and my husband stated, “Oh, you just missed a meteor shower.”  He then told me to look at these two lights in the sky.  There were two bright orange lights that did not flash.  The aircraft seemed to be hovering.  The lights were south of our house and appeared to be facing north.  They didn’t move for quite awhile.   There was no sound.  The sky was very clear.  We could see stars in the sky and they were definitely not stars.  Then my husband says, “Wow, look at all the planes in the sky.”   At first I didn’t see them, but then I did... there was at least ten planes flying toward this hovering aircraft.  Slowly the aircraft turned to its right... so east.  At this point there was a third light we could see, probably the rear of the aircraft.  And it slowly continued east.  Then all of the planes in the sky began to follow it.  It seemed to basically disappear shortly after moving;38.8173;-75.5957
