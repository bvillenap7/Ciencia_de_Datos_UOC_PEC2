We saw a light flickering way up north towards Bowers or Slaughters beach, it was tiny in one spot then every now and again there would be a line across from on side or the other of this center light. I figured out it was spinning and the lights were reflections from lights on the ground,as I explained this to my friend we were both looking at it when it cought the light perfectly and the whole side was revealed to us .It seemed to be rotating very fast and not perfectly smooth. I awoke in the morning got a pen and scribbled a picture that was the exact size the object appeared to us. He believes now and admits he saw a UFO.
