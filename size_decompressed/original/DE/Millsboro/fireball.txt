Fireball that moved slowly, changed direction, then disappeared followed by a second aircraft.;2019-10-05 20:00:00;5 minutes;Fireball that moved slowly, changed direction, then disappeared followed by a second aircraft. My wife and I were at our beach house In Millsboro, DE, sitting outside having a fire.  My wife spotted a large ball of light and pointed it out because it was very different from normal plane lights.  I honestly blew it off and kept watching just to debunk it. It looked like a comet that seemed to be coming towards us and for its size, it just moved too slowly and smoothly.  If the trajectory didn’t change at all I would still say comet but it quickly changed 90 degrees and after about 4 seconds completely disappeared as we watched. Shortly after another apparent aircraft appeared to be moving much faster but in the same trajectory.  The reason it stood out was the light pattern of flashing was not normal.  Aircraft marking lights are slow flashing, but the were going in a circular pattern, slightly slower than a strobe light.  My first instinct was something was monitoring the first thing we saw. We don’t remember the exact date but it was early October, 2019.;38.663;-75.2443
