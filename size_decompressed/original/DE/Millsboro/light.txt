I noticed two flashing lights in the sky in between the highway approx. 50-60 feet in the air.  At first I thought it was a helicopter flying in the air.  When the lights begin to flash, it was a red light first that's why I thought it was a helicopter, then I saw green lights flashing.  I said to myself I've never seen green lights on an aircraft before. (not saying it's not aloud, just strange to me).  Then I started to drive slow, with my window down to get a better look.  It didn't have any sound or noise coming from the aircraft. It began to move, change direction in a weird way.  That's when i knew it wasn't a helicopter by the way it was flying and how the lights were flashing and look.  I took my phone out and began recording it.  Other people that were driving their cars noticed it as well by the way they were hitting the break.  I turned on a road not far from my house. Stop the car and kept recording it.  I began to drive again, as i was driving the aircraft started flying in the direction I was going.  I thought it was following me.  I got a little nervous and stop recording and picked up speed to get home.  As I was telling my fiance what I saw I was getting the video ready to show her.  My phone only recorded 1 second of footage, but the file size of the video was 13MB.  I knew for a fact that  my phone was recording it because I saw the time going and i was hitting autofocus and theming in and out.
