White orbs and flashing lights in Millsboro, DE.;2017-05-25 21:00:00;10 minutes;White orbs and flashing lights in Millsboro, DE. We saw these white lights that looked like lightning and we realized that they weren't lightning because they were white orbs that were moving around.  They were extremely bright, then for about two minutes they disappeared.  They came back, but when they did they appeared as circular and it looked like the size of three horizontal school busses with two blinking lights one light was blue, the other light was green.  The blinking started slow, but gradually got faster.  It looked like it took the form of a cloud or it was the shape behind the cloud, but we couldn't tell.  I was shocked when I saw this because I have always had an interest in UFO's, but never thought they were actually real until that very night.  I would like to know if anyone has seen the same thing on May 25 around 21:00 (9:00pm);38.663;-75.2443
