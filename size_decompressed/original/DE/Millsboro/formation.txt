At that time we both saw a series of 5 or 6 round orbs of light, forming a perfectly straight horizontal line.  The lights were bright white at first, but quickly dimmed from white, to yellow, and then red before fading from sight. At the time we were driving south on rt 23, the lights were seen to the southwest, just above the tree line.;38.663;-75.2443
