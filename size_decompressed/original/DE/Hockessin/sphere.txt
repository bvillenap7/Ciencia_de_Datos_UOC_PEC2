We all know we saw the same circular glowing object that night;1989-12-23 20:00:00;5 mins;We all know we saw the same circular glowing object that night My parents and I (I was 16) we were leaving our development and went to a stop sign. Across the street was a graveyard, we all froze when we saw the glowing lights going around and round. The lights were circular and changed from blue to red and green. The object hoovered over the trees behind the graveyard. We all just sat there and looked at it until it went away, then left. My parents have always been reluctant to talk about it because of course, people woundnt believe it. Although we are ALL very sure of what we saw...

Observed stationary sphere while photographing chemtrails.  ((NUFORC Note:  Contrails.  PD));2005-12-23 13:36:00;?;Observed stationary sphere while photographing chemtrails On Dec 23, 2005 at 1:36 in the afternoon, I looked out my window and noticed an unusually vast number of straight patterned white chemtrails blanketing an otherwise clear bright sky.  There were minimal natural cloud formations.   I used my 5.0 megapixel Minolta digital camera to photograph the trails as well as at least 3 high altitude jets leaving the vast linear pattern of chemtrails. The planes were flying from E. to W.   Also, I observed what I thought was a daytime star which was unusually vivid.  Not having a great deal of celestial interest (or knowledge), I didn't think much of it and focussed on the chemtrails.   I took several photos of the chemtrails and downloaded them to my computer.  When I zoomed in on the planet it turned out to be a sphere with highlights and shading.  I did not take particular note of how long it was present in the early afternoon sky but I did remember that it was in a fixed position for at least a few minutes. I would be more than happy to send any or all of the photos I took that day. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that those chemtrails were, in fact, contrails.  PD));39.7793;-75.6945999999999
Large number of unidentified aircraft flying together.;2010-10-23 18:50:00;approx. 15 minutes;Large number of unidentified aircraft flying together. I noticed a large number of objects north of my home, most likely in Pennsylvania air space. They were moderately bright, red/orange in color. They were moving west to east at a slow, stable pace. After the large cluster was no longer visible, a few more objects came into view in the same area, moving west to east. Compared to several obvious commercial airplanes within my field of vision, they were moving slower than the planes and did not have blinking or rotating lights like most airplanes have. Their size, shape, and color were constant. When I went outside onto my deck to get a better view, I saw my neighbors in my driveway looking at the lights. I borrowed their binoculars, but the objects were too far away to identify.  I have never seen a flying object that I couldn't easily identify. I called the New Garden Flying Field in Toughkeamon, PA but didn't get an answer.  I am not sure if they have an air traffic control tower or not. If they do, they should! have been able to view the objects as the field is several miles north of my home.  The closest airport that I know of that does have an air traffic control tower is the New Castle County, DE airport.  I took 2 photographs with my iPhone, but the lights are not visible in the photos.;39.7793;-75.6945999999999
