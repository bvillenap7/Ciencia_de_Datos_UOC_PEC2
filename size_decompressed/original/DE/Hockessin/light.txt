Large light blue beam of light flying over very quickly;2017-09-30 19:51:00;2 seconds;Large light blue beam of light flying over very quickly Alright, I can't really explain it, but I can do my best.  I went out to walk my dog and I look at my phone to change the song and set it to some movie OST.  Then, as I look up in the sky a large blue beam of light passes over me, this beam as it passed over me, I saw how it was flying very low like at the altitude a plane gets up to a few minutes after taking off.  After I saw the beam of light blitz over me, I ran back up my street and to my house paranoid and scared half straight.  I was not able to get any photos due to the duration of the sighting, which may be a problem, but can't be fixed due to this.;39.7793;-75.6945999999999
