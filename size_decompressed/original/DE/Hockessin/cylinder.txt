We were driving in a car going to a school open house, when we suddenly saw 3 columns of lights slowly moving from left to right in the sky.   Each craft had about 4 or 5 lights in a straight line.  The line of lights was in a slanted orientation like a backslash moving in the air.  The 3 crafts were approximately a few hundred feet apart.
