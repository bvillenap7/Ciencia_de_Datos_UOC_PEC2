I was heading north through the town of Milford noticed a flashing light out of the corner of Mayeye turned and look to the left to see some kind of aircraft banking left but flying parallel to the road after watching it for 10 to 15 seconds it started to level out and head north west and I realized I should be taking a picture or video so by the time I got my phone out begin to record it I have moved a mile or so from me was still able to get a fairly clear footage of the aircraft. It went northwest for about 30 seconds then northeast until it crossed the road that it was running parallel with previously and then headed to North and disappeared from vision within 15 seconds. When I first saw the aircraft it couldn’t of been more than just a few thousand feet above the ground and it resembled a quad copter or drone but roughly the size of a C5 military aircraft I live near an air base and see them all the time landing and taking off so I’m very familiar with! the size given altitude at which they are traveling. Also there was no sound at all coming from the aircraft and as close as it was I would’ve been able to hear some type of engine running was not able to make visual contact on rotors or anything rotating to keep it in-flight.;38.9187;-75.4291
