Hover craft in milford;2017-01-13 19:50:00;4 minutes;Hover craft in milford We were driving south on route 1 just north of Milford, DE, about 15 miles south of the Dover Air Force , and we noticed 2 white lights with a red light in the center that was stationary.  At first we thought it was a tower but as we got closer we could see it was low and the shape was circular in the middle with 2 wings on the sides giving it a triangular shape. It was hovering over a farm.   After we past it it quickly passed over to the northbound side of route 1 and continued west until we lost sight.  It was completely quiet as it hovered and moved.;38.9187;-75.4291
