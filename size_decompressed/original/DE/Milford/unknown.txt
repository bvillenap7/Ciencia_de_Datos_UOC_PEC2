Long dark gray metallic object spotted in front of cloud, moving slower than a plane.;2003-07-13 12:00:00;1 minute;Long dark gray metallic object spotted in front of cloud, moving slower than a plane. We were driving home, Northbound on a Delaware highway near Milford. I was in the front passenger seat of the car. It was sunny, and there were clear skies, except for a few clouds. I was just observing outside and I kind of slouched in my seat a bit. Then I looked forward, out the windshield and saw a dark grayish object moving very slowly to the right. What got my attention was how slow it was moving. It didn't look like a plane at all. It was long and thin like a cylinder, but for all I know it could have been round and I was just seeing it from the side. It was in front of the clouds, and it reflected sunlight at each end of it, like a metal object would. I watched it for about a minute, then reached down for my binoculars which were at my feet to get a closer look. When I looked back up, the object was gone. I thought it might have just disappeared behind the cloud for a moment, so I kept my eyes on the cloud for a good 5 minutes, but it never reappeared.
