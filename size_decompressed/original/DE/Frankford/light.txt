bright white flying object in our backyard.;2002-06-01 02:45:00;continues now;bright white flying object in our backyard. Our 15 year old daughter woke us up crying that a bright light lit up her bedroom. We went into her room, I sat on her bed & watched for about 10 minutes. At the back of our property is woods that are not very thick, I saw a very bright white light. It looked to be about 4 inches around and was flashing. It went to the right & up past our neighbors house into the sky. We went outside and sat on the picnic table. The light appeared again flashing and moving to the right again. It always appeared to the left of us and moved to the right.It seemed to get smaller and not as bright after we went outside. Sometimes it went into the air, other times just past the trees out of sight. If anyone knows what this may be PLEASE let me know. On Sunday night my daughter saw this again, but did not wake us up, this was around 10:00p.m. Our neighbors have seen this also, but have not tried to find out what it is. If this is an animal I would like very much to know what it is. Our elementary school is on the other side of the woods.;38.5174;-75.1954
