As my daughter was driving us home from shopping last night through White Clay Creek State Park, we noticed some strange lights in the sky, but they were too far away to tell what was going on.  Once we got closer, we noticed they weren't really moving very fast.  As we neared the object we realized it was not a plane and it was directly overhead of us.  The object was HUGE!  It was diamond shaped and each point had a light on it. It hovered above the trees very slowly but was moving.  We could not believe what we were seeing!  It was making a strange wah wah sound.  As it was going in the opposite direction we were, we decided to turn around and follow it.  We turned around and could not locate it. It was gone!  We drove around for quite some time to try to locate it and as slow as it was going, we should have been able to easily find it, but we did not.;39.6706657794677;-75.7219904942969
