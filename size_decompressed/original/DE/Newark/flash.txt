Red blinking light near Venus on 7/12/12;2012-07-12 04:50:00;At least 10 minutes;Red blinking light near Venus on 7/12/12 At 4:45 am eastern time  I was outside at work and looked up 2 see the 2 planets that are in the sky this month (Venus and Jupiter) and next to Venus on the right side was a small flashing red orange light that did not move.    I work nights and have looked at the 2 planets every night this month but this was the first time I saw the flashing next to Venus.   It dident seem to be a plane because it dident move.  It was a very clear night and my coworker also saw it.;39.6706657794677;-75.7219904942969
