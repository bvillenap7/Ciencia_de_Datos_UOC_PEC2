Quickly moving bluish/green light w/ tail. Meteor?;1999-01-10 19:00:00;1.5 sec;Quickly moving bluish/green light w/ tail. Meteor? I was walking my dog. I noticed my shadow on the snow like there was a quick flash of light. I looked up to the basically clear sky and saw a blue-green fireball with a slight tail moving N to S very quick. I don't think it was a shooting star because it was too low. No noise. No arc like a fire work. Completely straight line. It was about at a 45 degree angle from me and about the length of a pinky finger at arm's length. Entire event from flashing to light extinguishing was about 1.5 seconds. I saw it for over .5 sec before it extinguished. It seemed close. I dont think it was any craft but probably a meteor, just thought you'd be interested. I am a 21 yr old college senior.;39.6706657794677;-75.7219904942969

Red glowing fireball floating across field in Newark delaware;2012-07-04 21:30:00;2 minutes;Red glowing fireball floating across field in Newark delaware Sitting with my family at the edge of a field by pep boys as we were waiting for the July 4th fireworks.  Just before the fireworks started, a fireball -like, silent light with a fog like haze around it flew in a linear formation VERY SLOWLY across the field.  My wife, kids, and I were so taken by this light that we had to get out of the car and watch it as it flew right over our car.   I've never seen anything like this in my life and they're we're at least 50 people waiting for the fireworks that saw this thing too!   So I'm interested to see if anyone else posts about this UFO...
