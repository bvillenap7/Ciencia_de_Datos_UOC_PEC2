3bright lights trianglular shape like an airplane, but hovering;2005-09-17 20:00:00;1 minute;3bright lights trianglular shape like an airplane, but hovering We were watching heat lighting and turned onto a road when my husband noticed what appeared to be a very low flying aircraft at a highspeed heading toward us.  Knowing there was no airport around we watched it fearing it was going to crash when it suddenly came to a complete stop and appeared to be hovering.  It had 3 bright nonflashing lights in the shape of a triangle and there was no noise.  We watched the craft while driving due to no place to pull over.  We stopped at a light and we really don't know what happened, it either moved quickly or turned off the lights.  A few moments later about 5 miles down the road in Cecil County, MD we noticed a large military cargo plane doing about a 15 mile radius circle around the two counties flying low as if it were searching for something.;39.6706657794677;-75.7219904942969
Orange-ish array of lights cruising over I-95 in Delaware;2009-09-05 04:30:00;40 min;Orange-ish array of lights cruising over I-95 in Delaware In vehicle heading North on I-95 around 4:30 am 9/5/09.  Saw huge array of orange lights over I-95, and another bright white light to the west.  The white object seemed to twinkle like a star but zooming in with a 20x camera I could see it had multiple parts so this was not a star. There was a large part with 2 smaller parts separated but close to it, these smaller parts seemed to move away from the large part, then return (I think that is the reason for the twinkle effect).  The orange looking array kept moving to the North but slowly, and always kept it's same configuration. These were visible from 4:30am to 5:15 am.  Video was taken at high zoom and some clear images were obtained for a few seconds. These objects seemed to be just moving North very slowly and made no sudden moves or speed changes.  I would estimate people from northern MD to NY could have seen this, but I have seen no reports on the news as of today (9/6/09). There were some clouds in the sky and a full moon was behind me as I traveled north.  I wish I had thought to get my camera out sooner as the orange object(s) were huge when first seen.  When I did manage to snap pics distance became a factor. I the orange array was the Goodyear Blimp, I'd say it was 2 miles in front of me when first seen, maybe 10 miles out when filmed. The white array, which I thought at first was Venus or a star, always seemed to be 20 miles or maybe thousands of miles away, and never seemed to get closer or farther away. With the naked eye, I would have to conclude the white thingy was a star, but after looking at the video I have to rule that out.  Naked eye on the orange array was never thought to be anything other than an array of dim, orange-ish lights grouped together.;39.6706657794677;-75.7219904942969
Noisy aircraft travelling slowly S. Low in the sky lights on each corner of triangle. Near Kirkwood Hwy and Polly Drummond Hill Rd.;2012-12-06 21:45:00;30 seconds;Noisy aircraft travelling slowly S. Low in the sky lights on each corner of triangle. Near Kirkwood Hwy and Polly Drummond Hill Rd. Noisy aircraft travelling slowly S. Low in the sky.  Lights on each corner of triangle.  Seemed large but that is probably only because it was much lower in the sky than most aircraft around here. Spotted near Kirkwood Hwy and Polly Drummond Hill Rd in Newark, DE.

Trianular shaped, silent aircraft with pulsing white lights silently and quickly passed over top in Newark, DE.;2015-04-15 21:30:00;2 minutes;Trianular shaped, silent aircraft with pulsing white lights silently and quickly passed over top in Newark, DE. Pulling onto my street, around 9:30pm on April 15th, 2015, which is located in a very nice and quiet neighborhood on the outskirts of Newark, Delaware, by the border of Pennsylvania, I happened to look to the left in the west and up into the sky as I usually do, driving home.   I noticed some bright and what I thought were distant lights moving slowly towards my direction eastward.    My first thought was that it was a commercial airliner coming straight towards where is was on Bristol Lane in Cotswold Hills.  I don’t usually see lights this bright or commercial airliners for that matter moving in this direction over top of my neighborhood which slightly sparked my interest. The  PHI Airport is a little over 35 miles NE from me and I do see lots of air traffic at night when skies are clear and this was a clear night.   The Dover Air Force Base is about 50 miles south of me. As I looked up and saw the aircraft, I thought is was far away and might have been low flying because it didn’t appear to be high in the sky.  I was still driving and slowed to stop and watch the aircraft as I saw it approaching fairly quickly.  Within about 30 seconds of spotting it in the distance, it was now almost right on top of where I was.   I quickly rolled the windows down, shut the car off, and stuck my head out of the window to listen for any engine noises.  I heard nothing.  It was still silent outside.  Looking up I could now see that this craft had three large randomly pulsing white lights underneath of it with one red light in the center.  The white lights were not all pulsing at the same time.  They were pulsing independently of each other.  The red light was a solid and consistent brightness.  As the craft went directly over top of me I noticed it was still making no noise at all.  My neighborhood is very quiet and I can usually hear, jets, propeller p! lanes and helicopters.  There is a farm field behind my neighborhood and no bright shopping centers or main roads are very close to me to create noise or light pollution. Looking straight up I also noticed that the body of the craft is in the definite shape of a large dark triangle because it blocked out the sky in that area which was full of stars this night.  I also noticed now that it was moving very quickly because it was very far away at first but within seconds it was on top of me.  As it went overhead, I could see one more small red like in the very back center of the triangle.  It quickly, silently passed over top of me and over the house to my immediate right.  Still no noise at all.  I put my head back into the car and started it up again and then quickly pulled forward to track the object after it was blocked by the house.   When I saw the object again, which was only about 5 seconds later, it was very far away moving in the same eastern direction.  It might have been at least a mile away at that point and quickly and steadily moved away and out of sight in the next minute until I couldn’t see it at all anymore.  That was the last I saw of it.;39.6706657794677;-75.7219904942969
Triangular UFO sighting.;2019-09-26 22:50:00;10 minutes;Triangular UFO sighting Was driving home from a late night workout, and saw a noticeably bright and flashing light.  After a few minutes, it was apparent that it was moving, so I pulled over.  I saw two people on the other side of the road recording on their phones.   I was by the Newark Farmers Market when all this had happened.;39.6706657794677;-75.7219904942969
Observed a stationary triangular shaped object over Cecil County, Md. at 5:10 on 12/5/2019.;2019-12-05 05:00:00;10 mins.;Observed a stationary triangular shaped object over Cecil County, Md. at 5:10 on 12/5/2019. While driving to work this morning I witnessed an object in the sky. It appeared to be motionless. Hard to make out shape, but it appeared to triangular.  It had clear/white lights. Ten minutes later when I arrived at work,  I got out of my car and the object was still visible. It did not appear to have changed its location.  It appeared to be over Cecil County, Md., but not being able to judge how high up it was in the sky it's hard to say for certain.;39.6706657794677;-75.7219904942969
