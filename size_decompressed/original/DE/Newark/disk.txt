I was leeving work at 9:00 on a friday night.  I stepped out the building and felt something over me and looked up to see a flying spacecraft hovering closely to the ground.  I screamed for my boss who was just inside the office but my voice was not heard.  It hovered above me long enough for me to look it over real good.  I new it was a ufo.  It took off at a very high rate of speed without making a noise.  I now what i saw!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!;39.6706657794677;-75.7219904942969
Strange cloud changed shapes and became a saucer.;2011-09-15 17:00:00;10 minutes;Strange cloud changed shapes and became a saucer. I was walking my dog and I looked up at the sunset, red clouds moving South to North.  When I noticed a dark grey cloud moving slowly North to South.  I thought it was unusual because it had 2 white tendrils and looked like a grey football being kicked over goal post.  I noticed it stopped and the tendrils changed shape...I know this will sound crazy but each tendril became a representation of the star ship Enterprise one large and one a third of the size of the right side.  These keep this shape a while and then they became a rectangle with  a sphere on top as it moved away it twisted and disappeared all the while the dark grey cloud remained stationary.  I notice a darker grey disc in the center that went horizontal and  the cloud started to shimmer that when I notice it was a saucer shape and in seconds the entire cloud disappeared.
