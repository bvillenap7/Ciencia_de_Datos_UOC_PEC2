Red and green lights and spinning quick movements in a crowded place.;2014-07-11 21:00:00;10 minutes;Red and green lights and spinning quick movements in a crowded place. We were at a carnival and I looked up and I saw a diamond/rectangle shaped aircraft.  It was about 10,000 feet in the air and it had about 4 lights that flickered (in no pattern or sequence) red and green. The aircraft hovered and then made very fast movements back and forth, it also made spinning movements.  The spinning, quickness, spontaneity of the lights and closeness to the ground ruled out any possibility of this being a plane or helicopter. Not many people saw it because no one made a big deal but I alerted my friend and she also agreed that it was like nothing she had ever seen before. After about 10 minutes of scoping the 1 mile radius, the aircraft seemed to just disappear.;39.6706657794677;-75.7219904942969
