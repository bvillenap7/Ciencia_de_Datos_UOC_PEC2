Red-Orange light seen from the University of Delaware campus;2005-11-08 17:48:00;2 minutes;Red-Orange light seen from the University of Delaware campus While walking back form class this evening, I noticed a bright, red-orange light in the south sky travelling north.  At first I though the light was an airplane, but there were no flashing lights on the craft.   After about two minutes of watching the light, it dimmed to a barely visible white dot and appeared to start travelling toward the east.  It disappeared from my line of sight (some buildings were blocking the way), and I did not make the effort to move and look for it again. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of an aircraft, we suspect.  PD));39.6706657794677;-75.7219904942969
Object traveling at an extreme speed and maneuvers not capable by any known aircarft;2007-06-06 02:50:00;2-5 minutes;Object traveling at an extreme speed and maneuvers not capable by any known aircarft Roughly around 2:30am this morning I went out on my deck to have a smoke before going off to sleep.  After about 5 minutes or so I gazed at the stars as I normally do during the night.  As I looked over an adjacent house I noticed a flying object moving at and incredible speed.  It was not at an altitude of a commercial airliner.  It passed behind a tree line.  A few seconds came back into sight, made a incredible vertical change in direction.  Rose for about a mine and shot horizontally.  The object continued in this head for about 15 seconds and rose vertically again then vanished. The speed this object moved was at nothing I have ever seen in my life.  The sharp turns and maneuvers it made are just not feasibly possible with any known aircraft.  It did not have any distinct shape, just a white circle light.   This sighting whatever it is will be stuck in my mind for a very long time indeed.

White haze/light moving at amazing speeds.  Far greater than any known military or commercial aircraft;2009-05-30 00:15:00;4 minutes;White haze/light moving at amazing speeds.  Far greater than any known military or commercial aircraft I went to bed early on this night and awoke around 12:15am, to a thumping noise.  Although I do not believe the noise is related, I somehow felt the need to look out my window.  I pulled the blinds back and noticed a white hazy object, hovering above the treeline across the street from where I live.  The object was at a distance of anywhere between 5-7 miles away.  It was a particularly clear night and the stars were out.  It was a white light moving in a small circlular patter, very eratically.  I stared in disbelief and then walked outside to observe.  It was very quiet.  The object hovered for about 3 minutes off to the west and then suddenly shot directly to the north very rapidly, maintaining altitude and distance.  I continued to observe the light for about another minute, before it shot off at an amazing speed toward the north, northeast.;39.6706657794677;-75.7219904942969
Green glowing silent orb moving S at 30&#730 down from the horizon looking east near Kirkwood Hwy and Polly Drummond Hill Rd in Newark;2012-12-05 12:30:00;20 seconds;Green glowing silent orb moving S at 30 & #730 down from the horizon looking east near Kirkwood Hwy and Polly Drummond Hill Rd in Newark Green glowing silent orb travelling S at 30 degrees down from the horizon.  Disappeared behind tree line.  Looking east near intersection of Kirkwood Hwy and Polly Drummond Road in Newark, DE. Different from a green firework because it didn’t exhibit a parabolic trajectory such as an object in free fall.  Different than meteorite because of bright green color that did not fade.

Object was m;2019-12-12 19:30:00;20 seconds;Witnessed low flying craft over the PA side of White Clay Creek State Park while driving on Hopkins Rd towards Route 896.  Object was moving slowly over the tree, made no noise that could be heard in the car.  It was too far away to make out a definite shape but it was larger than a helicopter and the whole bottom was a bright white light.and at the same time appeared mirrored.   It was gone in a blink of an eye.  It was easily visible when we were driving next to the open fields but as lost sight of it when we drove into the trees we lost sight of it.  We didn’t see it after that.  We thought we’d see it again once we cleared the trees but it disappeared.  It was dark out and the object although close was too far away to notice any details besides the light.;39.6706657794677;-75.7219904942969
Lights moving evenly in single file at a fast pace.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-28 20:51:00;1 minute;Lights moving evenly in single file at a fast pace. Looking up at the moon I noticed a few lights moving west to east and thought it was a couple of jets.  Realized that there was no sound and no flashing lights like I would normally hear and see. As far as I could see to the East and West there was a line of evenly spaced lights (too many to count, but there were dozens) moving at a fast pace. I called my wife to come out and see. She only saw the last 3.;39.6706657794677;-75.7219904942969
