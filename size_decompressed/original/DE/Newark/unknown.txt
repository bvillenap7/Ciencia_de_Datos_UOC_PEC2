Amber light seen above Newark, Delaware. Aprox 3:30am;2005-02-23 03:15:00;3-5 Min;Amber light seen above Newark, Delaware. Aprox 3:30am I saw blinking intense amber light that I first mistook for a planet. After looking back to the sky I noticed it had moved a drastic amount in the sky. I put my head on the windowsill to keep my head steady and noticed it move from a static position to a constant velocity for maybe 3 seconds and then stop with no acceleration/deceleration. It was snowing that night (the light was intense compared to streetlamps around it), but I thought that I could make out a feint circular shape. I have been fascinated with flight since I was young and I have never heard/seen of any aircraft moving like this.;39.6706657794677;-75.7219904942969
Very brilliant white light over northern Delaware, hovering for an hour and then shot upward into space.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus.  PD));2007-10-29 04:30:00;60 minutes;Very brilliant white light over northern Delaware, hovering for an hour and then shot upward into space. I woke up around 4:20am because I was having trouble sleeping.  I was in my living room, sleeping near sliding doors and it was a very clear night.  I looked up a star chart just so I wouldn't make a mistake here.  Facing south/southeast, about 30-35 degrees above the horizon, a very bright white light was hovering over the tree line.  It almost looked like the northern star, but was 100 times more brilliant.  The object was far off in the distant, but after observing it for about 20-25 minutes, it made a very slow, controlled movement toward the south (left to right), not by much.  Very very small, slow movements.  The object continued to hover for about 50-60 minutes.  My wife came out of the bedroom, because she claimed she could not sleep either.  She observed it as well, and as a science teacher, she was curious also.  After about an hour, the object took a straight upward, controlled increase in elevation, starting out very slow and then increasing upward at a faster rate of speed, until object lost site into the stratosphere and further upward into what appeared to be outer space.  Object was looked for throughout the early morning hours and the next evening, but was not seen again.  I think it's safe to say this wasn't a weather balloon or meteor military!  I also might note that there is a local airport with very little traffic nearby, however, this airport also houses military aircraft for soldier transports, usually to and from Iraq.  Furthermore, these aircraft are incapable of going straight upward and also do not have the ability to hover for hours at a time, for all you skeptics. Make your own opinion. ((NUFORC Note:  Venus.

Reg, green lights, movement atypical.;2014-08-28 20:30:00;2 minutes;Reg, green lights, movement atypical. I was driving along rte 273 towards Newark.  I saw an object with 2 red lights and 2 green lights in the air.  I thought I was seeing an aircraft go down because it moved towards the ground (still high though), stayed there, shot up and down again and then flew forward.   An airplane and helicopter cannot move like that.  I could not tell the shape as the sky was dark. I thought it was triangular but can't be sure.  I have never seen something like that in my life.;39.6706657794677;-75.7219904942969
