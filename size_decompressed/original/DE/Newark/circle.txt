Two very bright lights seen in the sky before vanishing, one seen a second time in a different location several minutes later;2007-12-15 18:25:00;15 minutes;Two very bright lights seen in the sky before vanishing, one seen a second time in a different location several minutes later Last Saturday evening, the 15th of December, I was running some errands. I was on my way from my apartment to my place of work to pick up my paycheck (about a 5 minute drive.) I was alone in the car. There are two ways to get to my work, and if I had chosen the way that I usually prefer to take, I may not have seen what I saw that night. I thought that this other way would be quicker though, so I went that way. I almost made the light at the intersection of Wyoming Road (which I was on, facing east) and Marrow's Road, but it turned red just before I got there, so I was stopped for a few minutes waiting to make a left turn. To the south (my right side) of this intersection is a large suburban residential area. To the northwest (roughly behind me) is a shopping center. Directly east (in front of me) is a large warehouse of some kind, and slightly to the northeast of that building is a highly visible chemical factory building with large smokestacks (which I always jokingly call those pretty cloud machines.) I don't think there was anyone else stopped at the intersection. The sky that night was completely overcast not a single star could be seen anywhere. The sun had set, so it was fully nightttime, but because of the cloud cover bouncing back the light pollution it was relatively light outside. So I was sitting at the red light and just looking ahead of me, when I saw two very bright, circular or spherical white lights come out of nowhere in the eastern sky, above the warehouse. I thought they must be planes at first, and Delaware does have an airport somewhat nearby with occasionally low-flying planes, but these objects were hovering and not traveling in a straight trajectory. The lights on them were also much brighter than on a plane. It was difficult to tell exactly how far away from me they were, and I did not hear any noise. The two lights were close together at first. The one on the right remained stationary in the sky, and its light was stable. The one on the left was blinking on and off, and moved slowly to the left (north.) I got the feeling that the stationary one was in some way controlling the movements of the other one. As I watched this I realized they were not ordinary aircraft, and it seemed that the instant I thought this, the lights stopped moving for a second and then gradually retreated back behind the thick cloud cover. From my perspective, it looked like they faded out before disappearing. I had the distinct impression that they had been aware I was watching, and the whole thing spooked me out. The traffic light turned green and I continued on my way, trying to analyze what had happened and think of any other possible explanations. I was mad that I had forgotten to take out my camera, but I was so shocked by what I was seeing and it was over very quickly (the lights were visible for maybe 20-30 seconds or so total.)  After picking up my paycheck, I went to my mother's house, which is in a residential neighborhood off of Kirkwood Highway. As I pulled onto her street (again facing east) I saw just one of these same bright white lights. The light was not blinking, so I assumed it was the non-blinking one I had seen before (it looked exactly the same), but it could have been the blinking one from before or possibly a third craft. I pulled into my mom's driveway while continuing to watch the light, which was still just moving slowly around in the sky, hovering. I looked at the clock so at least I would know exactly what time it was on this second sighting...it was 6:41 pm. Now I thought of my camera and fished around in my purse for it, but was unable to locate it. (I had taken it out a couple nights before to take pictures of something else and never put it back.) I kept watching the light, and again it was like the craft knew I was watching and conspiring to take pictures of it. Suddenly, the bright light was shut off, but I could still see three very dim lights in a triangular pattern in its place. The lights were (I think) red/pink, blue/green, and yellow/orange. This triangular formation then moved to the left (north) and disappeared behind a house. That was the last I saw of it. When I got home that night, I drew pictures of what I had seen and jotted down the details. I looked up the locations where I saw these craft on Mapquest, and I was definitely looking almost directly east both times. I am a college student in my senior year, and I work part time in customer service. I was not under the influence of any intoxicants at the time. I believed in UFOs and extraterrestrial intelligence before, but now I am even more sure that they exist. I am not sure that what I saw could not have been explained by man-made technology, but I can't shake the feeling that they knew I was watching and altered their movements because of it.;39.6706657794677;-75.7219904942969
Multiple witnesses of 2 flying disks in Newark, DE on 08/29/10;2010-08-29 15:30:00;2+ minutes;Multiple witnesses of 2 flying disks in Newark, DE on 08/29/10 While driving to the Christiana Mall in Newark today, I noticed two metallic disks flying rather close to one another. They were absolutely silent and moved slightly sporadically.  The disks were spinning, but not on a perfect axis.  They were not in sync, but they stayed relatively close to one another for the approximate two minutes in which I observed them. It seemed as though they were moving closer and they flew higher extremely fast.   From my perspective, it seemed as if they flew straight up into the sky. I was able to keep an eye on the objects the whole time until I had to travel below an overpass and I lost sight of the objects, which were very far away the last time I had my eye on them. I was a passenger in a car with two other people, who both observed the objects.  Traffic notably slowed down on the exit ramp, as I assume that other drivers noticed them as well. When the car I was in parked at the mall, I got out and saw an unmarked plane, and I am! not sure if it had any relation to the UFO sighting I had witnessed minutes before.   The sighting did not have any physical effects on me or on any of the other passengers in the car that I was traveling in.  As one who takes particular interest in UFOs I was absolutely speechless to observe the sighting, and it has left a traumatizing mental effect, as the images I saw have been in my head the whole day. I am very curious as to whether or not anybody else reported the sighting.;39.6706657794677;-75.7219904942969
After running at the Glasgow Park off of 896 and rt 40, my friend texts me and asks, Dude, did you see those 8 orange lights leavin;2012-08-02 21:00:00;5 seconds;After running at the Glasgow park off of 896 and rt 40, my friend texts me and asks, Dude did you see those 8 orange lights leaving the park?   I told him I did not b/c I was not paying great attention as I had taxed myself heavily in the workout. But he distinctly saw 8 orange, dull colored lights in the distance and could not hear any noise, then they all started to disappear one by one.   This happened approximately at 9 PM Eastern Standard time during a dingy colored full moon on a clear night. Temperature is in the 80s at the time with about 95% humidity.  There were more mosquitoes than average out tonight and I recall some strange activity among animals in the area. This actually reminds me now of a sighting I saw myself about 2 or 3 months ago while driving towards Wilmington on 95 North, probably a few miles from exit 7. I remember driving and seeing a strange rotating craft appear on my right with 3 distinct lights, it was hard to see, but it appeared that one of the lights was changing colors from red to green and I had my windows down but I could not hear any distinct afterburner sounds.  I was driving most likely around 70-75 mph and I lost the craft as trees began to appear in the foreground.  I have also witnessed strange crafts/lights in the Florida area.;39.6706657794677;-75.7219904942969
Two silvery-white circular shaped craft appeared to use a cloaking technology to reappear and disappear.;2012-08-05 17:50:00;2-5 seconds;Two silvery-white circular shaped craft appeared to use a cloaking technology to reappear and disappear. Hello. I am the same guy that reported the sighting on August the 2nd after leaving the Glasgow Park. This time I was on the deck of my backyard during the brewing of the late afternoon thunderstorms that were quickly covering Northern Delaware around 5-6 PM Eastern Time.  I was sitting on my deck watching the clouds swirl as there appeared to be one frontal system coming from a Southwestern direction that was bisected by another from a Southeastern direction.  As I stand on my deck watching the clouds move with grace and speed, I noticed in the distance at what appeared to be a great altitude, maybe that of what you would typically see inbound and outbound flights appear at, but just under the main cloud layer that was forming. They were a silvery white colored and my initial thought in trying to recognize what these 2 objects were is that it may have been 2 seagulls flashing their white underbelly as the sung shines a reflection from it to my direction. Howe! ver, what happened next lead me to believe these were not birds or traditionally inbound, outbound passenger airliners as they disappeared as if they were cloaking for 2 seconds and then they reappeared in the next breath to only disappear for good after a few more seconds (another 2 to 3).  They were flying in the general direction that the storm system was heading, a Northeastern direction (they were following the frontal system that was coming from the southwest).   Both of these objects were far from where I was standing, from what I could tell but they were tightly grouped together. They did not zig or zag, they merely were flying in what appeared from my parallax as a straight pattern toward a northeast direction. Maybe due to the sunlight's distortion or other exogenous factors, the crafts appeared to be silver at first but then they appeared to be more of a pure white color. I did not see any flashing lights, just merely the objects themselves. And as for the shape o! f the craft, they were a spherical or circular fit. I did not ! see any visible wings, but that does not mean there weren't any wings b/c from my vantage point, I was quite far. The reason I decided to report this is b/c of the peculiar cloaking and reappearing nature of these crafts. I have never seen any aircraft ever do this to my knowledge. As to the specifics of weather, it was not quite raining yet, it was cool outside due to the coming frontal system, daylight was still visible although it was quickly dimming due to the dark cloud systems forming, and this is my 2nd late evening sighting within 3 days. Also, the objects left no visible contrails and I did not hear any audible jet or engine noise.;39.6706657794677;-75.7219904942969
Circle with lites.;2013-08-29 20:30:00;2.5 hours;Circle with lites. it was a circle with what I thought was 6 lites it stayed in the same place with little movement wich I say drifted up and to the right inches from far away but maybe long distance in reality.  it looks far but I can see the circle and the lites brite white green blue I thought red but im not sure. and it is in the same place again tonight my phone can not capture it but now my sister sees it too. also the stars moved faster I feel asleep before it went away.;39.6706657794677;-75.7219904942969

At first I thought it was just a helicopter.  Then people around us started to take notice of it, because the movements of it were so strange.   At one point, it hovered downward real slow, then shot back up really fast, then shot forward, and then backwards.  We couldn't take our eyes off it.  It actually was there for about 20 mins, until it just disappeared in the blink of an eye.  I am 100% certain that this was not a helicopter or any type of man-made aircraft.   I've never experienced something like this in my life.;39.6706657794677;-75.7219904942969
