On my way to work I saw 3 white lights in a triangle formation, hovering above the tree line at the end of my road.  Around the three main lights there appeared to be a few, smaller lights flashing.   The object did not move, until about 10-15 seconds after I witnessed the object.   The lights slowly started to dim as the object began moving slowly towards the north until it totally disappeared.   A passerby stopped at the side of the road after witnessing the same object.
