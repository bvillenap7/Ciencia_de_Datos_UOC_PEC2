group of reddish lights flying over a residential neighborhood.;2010-10-30 23:35:00;45 seconds;group of reddish lights flying over a residential neighborhood. My friend said what is that?.  We looked over to the right, not sure what direction, and over the houses in the nieghborhood were 5 orange/red lights.  they did not look to be pulsating but they were all in a semi-correlated line, some at different elevations but not drastically.  quickly followed two more and within the minute they were off in the horizon. my only explanation is a group of helicopters, but we didnt hear anything and I am not sure where they would have came from in the first place. I attempted to get a video/pic on my cellphone but the street light ruled that out unfortunately. and yes we were all completely sober. they were no further than the end of the street so they were very close to our proximity.;39.6102;-75.6747

20+ bright red lights flying together over Bear, DE.;2015-12-20 21:45:00;10 minutes;20+ bright red lights flying together over Bear, DE. 21:45 looking west watched approximately 20 bright red lights cross the sky over the course of 10-15 minutes.  Very bright, non-blinking lights in groups of 2-3 crossed the sky.  Did not hear any sound and did not see any color of light other than red.  Most appeared to fly about the same speed but saw one light rush to catch up to a group ahead of it.  They did not fly particularly fast except for the one that caught up to the others.  Speed was still not particularly fast.  I live close to New Castle airport so planes flying over are very common from small/medium jets to military aircraft from the Delaware Air Guard.  These lights were not like anything I have seen fly over before and they actually flew away from the direction of the airport.   Also, had other aircraft flying by normally at the same time for comparison, these did not look like airplanes or helicopters at night.  I managed to take one picture with my phone, it is not particularly sharp but does show 4 of the lights in the right side of the frame and one more entering the left side.  I am emailing the picture.

In the sky above neighborhood homes to the northwest I saw a line of red-orange lights not blinking flying northward.  They appeared about 25 degrees off the horizon.  The lights were a good size as if closer to the ground but no noise.  I kept comparing what I saw to aircraft flying over, we live on the approach to Philadelphia airport.  Not even close in size, speed, heading or view.  They were mostly in a line but some were in pairs.  These lights did not blink.  I watched as they headed north eventually out of sight.;39.6102;-75.6747
A bright, fire-like light and a small orb that protruded from it.  ((anonymous report));2017-01-01 19:00:00;4-5 minutes;A bright, fire-like light and a small orb that protruded from it. I took my dog outside around 7PM and noticed a dim orange gold light off in the distance.  From where I was standing on the front porch, it appeared to be level with the other houses, but it was obviously very far away.  I thought it was a helicopter and didn't think much else of it. About a minute later I turned around and saw that the light was very close and was slightly higher up than it was before.  It was flickering wildly and looked like fire.  It was coming my way at an accelerated speed and I began to wonder if it was going to fly over me. Then it stopped and started going upwards slowly.  I watched it go up for a couple minutes, all the while it dimly flashed every once in a while. After watching for about 4 minutes, a smaller light came out from the top of the bigger light, hovered over it for a few seconds and shot upwards, out of sight.  After that, the bigger light started moving away from me and ascending upwards until it was out of sight. I would also like to mention that my dog stopped to watch the object ever 30 seconds before going back to sniffing.;39.6102;-75.6747
Two bright white lights flying silently over Bear Delaware;2019-10-31 20:00:00;30 seconds;Two bright white lights flying silently over Bear Delaware I was testing my camera and saw two bright white lights about the size of A large star fly from the south east to north west at high speed. They were about 20 yards apart, the one on the left was flying in almost a strait line, the one on the right was weaving back and forth toward the left one. They were about 600 to 1000 feet above me and they were silent. I pointed my camera at them with video already running but Iâ€™m not sure if I captured them.;39.6102;-75.6747
