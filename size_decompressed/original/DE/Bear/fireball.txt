Fireball sighted about midnight traveling northeast in Bear, Delaware.;2012-07-04 00:00:00;1-2 minutes;Fireball sighted about midnight traveling northeast in Bear, Delaware. I saw what looked like a ball of fire traveling north east.   At first, I couldn't tell which direction it was traveling.   I called my husband over to look and it was then obvious it was traveling away from us.   My husband said it looked like a rocket.;39.6102;-75.6747
15+ orange fireballs sequentially moving north at a moderate speed in Bear, DE.;2012-12-23 20:30:00;4 minutes;15+ orange fireballs sequentially moving north at a moderate speed in Bear, DE. December 23, 2012 Bear, DE Route 1   I was driving south on Route 1 through Bear, DE and seen a string of orange lights moving across the sky. I pulled over and used my cell phone to obtain video of them.  They looked like orange orbs or flares but they wouldn’t ‘burn out’.  They moved gingerly across the sky in the same direction.  The lights were relatively low to the ground, maybe 1000ft in the air from the ground. The lights wouldn’t fall to the ground.  The lights did not spread or dissipate sporadically.  They seemed to just follow each other north across the sky very intriguing.   I looked all around for some sort of explanation such as a fire or a plane but, there was nothing.  I could not explain it.;39.6102;-75.6747
