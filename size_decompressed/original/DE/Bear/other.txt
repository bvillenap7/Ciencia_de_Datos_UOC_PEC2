At approximately 9:30am Monday August 26th I was leaving my house and while driving saw a dark object in the sky.  I sat in my car at a stop sign and witnessed the object gain and lose altitude quickly.  I believe other drivers saw it as well.  I took two still pictures with my phone that are fairly clear and show what I would describe as a mushroom shaped object.  It may have changed shap slightly, getting wider at the bottom. I initially thought it was a hot air balloon, however oh was very dark unlike typically brightly colored hot air balloons.  I also thought it could be a skydiver but I did not see or hear any aircraft in have sky.  It also hovered in the sky then seemed to rise quickly, fall at about the same speed, the rise again slowly. I watched it for about 2 minutes in total before I realized I would be late for work and drive behind trees.;39.6102;-75.6747
