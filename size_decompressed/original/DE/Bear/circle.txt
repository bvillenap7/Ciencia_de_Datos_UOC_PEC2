As we approached the stop sign, my son and I witnessed a round ball shaped object with an orange, glowing, burning, center. (It was  the shape of a basket ball or a beach ball with a flame in the middle).   To our amazement, we stopped the car at the stop sign and got out of the vehicle at that time it was low in the sky but not too far away.   We estimate it was only about 500 feet in the air.   My wife then also got out of the car (she was in the back seat).  At first, she thought we were looking at something in the road, but she saw us looking up at the object.  It traveled slowly, with no noise, and continued on a straight line path and gradually increased in altitude.   We watched it for 5 minutes until it disappeared.  By the time it disappeared, it was extremely high in the sky.  It traveled from the south to the north.;39.6102;-75.6747
