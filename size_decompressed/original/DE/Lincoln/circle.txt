blinking lights, silent, moved rather quickly.;2008-11-20 23:00:00;5 minutes;blinking lights, silent, moved rather quickly. I was called outside by a family member of mine, he told me to look at these lights in the sky, we were on the back step when i first saw them, I thought they were planets because they shine bright in the sky, but there was two lights, and they were relatively close to each other, after looking at them they also were blinking like a camera flash, and some time passed and one went to the left, and the other light almost looked like it started to rise up for about five seconds, the light that had went to the left was a good way in front of the rising light, I watched to see where they were going because they were out of my view once they went over the house (silently) and they were both going in the same direction one behind the other in almost a straight line. I went out maybe ten minutes later and saw maybe three more of these lights, all blinking in the sky, they also were going in the direction the others had went.  While all of this had happened there were three planes (clearly planes) that had went through my view also, two in the opposite direction and one went in the direction the blinking lights had went.;38.8627;-75.3996
