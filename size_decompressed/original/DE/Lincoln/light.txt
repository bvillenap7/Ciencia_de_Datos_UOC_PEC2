I went to take my dogs outside when I noticed 3 blinkings lights in the sky.  They looked like they were far away and I assumed they were planes... that is until I realized they weren't moving, just hovering. I ran inside and got my littler brother who came and had a look for himself. The lights appeared to be moving just a tiny bit but not too much. One went dark then came back on..  then After a few minutes both of them stopped blinking and it looked like they disappeared. -  By the way they were changing from red to white in color.;38.8627;-75.3996
