Triangle craft with 3 bright lights;2002-09-29 21:30:00;30 minutes;Triangle craft with 3 bright lights Traveling on Rt 300 toward Kenton. Noticed in distance where the electrical conduit at the end of Bryn-Zion Rd, on Underwoods Rd there was bright light. Thought that was strange I never noticed the electrical tower had lights before. As I drove about 30 seconds, noticed lights coming closer. Thought that it was flying very low for airplane. It was traveling slower than plane, almost hovering it moved so slow for an airplane. Only the speed of a car. It was the size of a plane with two big very bright lights in front, one in back, so gave appearance of being triangle, but even as it intersected and flew over me on route 300, I could see no details of the actual craft. Even though it was so low, that had it been flying toward me, rather than cross ways, I think the passengers could have seen right in my car. I actually ducked in my car as it flew over, as a reflex. I had no radio on and my driver's side window was slightly down and still I heard no noise. The lights were very bright but not searching, they were straight like headlights on each end of the front of the craft. It flew right over top of me and continued on over field in direction of Air Base. There we 2 cars behind me in the distance, maybe 2 miles. So I know they would have seen this low flying aircraft. It would have caught their attention if for no other reason than it was flying extremely low.

Very bright Triangle/U shaped light.;2015-08-22 19:00:00;20 minutes;Very bright Triangle/U shaped light. I was looking up at the moon in my driveway.  The sky was still blue because the sun hadn't set yet.  A light about the size of the north star appeared out of nowhere  directly to the right of the moon.  It stayed in one place for 2-3 minutes before moving slowly to the south, then becoming stationary again for a few minutes.  The light went back north at the same speed as when it went south.  It was stationary for a few more moments and then traveled east.  There where no flashing/blinking lights, it never changed color, nor did it make a sound.  In my opinion it wasn't even in our atmosphere.  The light was just as bright as the north star on a clear night.  I decided to take my telescope out when it was stationary to the east.  What I saw through the telescope, I can't get out of my head. My wife took a look and it freaked her out so bad she could take another look.  I studied this object for as long as I could.  It was a triangle or almost U shaped. In my telescope it was as big as a nickel so with something that size in the telescope I would think you would be able see some type of structure, but there wasn't.  It was just a very bright white triangle/U shape light that moved from north to south back to north and then east.  For me, the most incredible event was when it decided to leave.  As I was looking at it with the telescope, it started to move east more so I had to keep adjusting the telescope.  I found it, I centered it and in a faction of a second it was gone.  After witnessing something like this, it has me definitely looking up and questioning a lot of things.;39.2934;-75.6017999999999
