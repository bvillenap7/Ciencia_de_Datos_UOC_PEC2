Unexplainable acceleration and deceleration in proportion to emitted light intensity.;2007-11-01 04:00:00;5 sec.;Unexplainable acceleration and deceleration in proportion to emitted light intensity. I was laying out watching for meteors, facing North East. I noticed two lights traveling about two finger widths apart, one trailing the other, at equal speed. They were just slightly brighter than the average stars. I don't believe I can give an accurate altitude. Way up there. Initially I thought it could be the shuttle catching up to the space station. After about 2 to 3 seconds, the one trailing got about 5 times brighter for one second, and caught up to the leading one and returned to equal brightness. They were extremely close and continued a South West path till disappearing. The reason I believe it was a UFO is because of the change of the intensity of the light was directly proportional to it's speed. I also cannot explain it not overshooting the leading object after exhibiting such acceleration. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.
