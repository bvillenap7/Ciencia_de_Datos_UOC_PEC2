Black craft with two white lights above housing development;2011-03-24 23:05:00;5 minutes;Black craft with two white lights above housing development Driving home from work I saw two light in the distance which looked like street lights but extra large. As I came up to the area the craft was above a housing development about 150 feet.  The craft was black except for the two white lights on the underneeth of the craft on either side.  The lights were not shining down they were as if they were contained to the craft itself.  It was approximately 100 feet in length and 50 feet in width.   I pulled over thinking it was from the airbase near by but it made no sound and was just sitting still above the houses.   I watched the craft for approximately 5 minutes.;39.2934;-75.6017999999999
