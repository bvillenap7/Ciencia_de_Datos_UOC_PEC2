First we heard a sound coming from somewhere on the other side of trees like a winding noise loud, then a few minutes after it stopped a red glowing light appeared in middle way of tree line.  It started circling the pond up and down while still in the tree line, silent.  I can't recall anything after that its been 30 years since I can remember it at all.;38.6397;-75.6047
