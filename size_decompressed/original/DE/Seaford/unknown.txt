Strange lights in the sky;2002-12-27 19:00:00;5 minutes;Strange lights in the sky we had left my inlaws and were on the way to the store. We saw a large light in the sky which seemed to follow us. It was bigger than lights on an airplane,much bigger than anything else in the sky, and seemed to change colors, from a yellowish white, to a red orange. It was there till we got to the end of the road and then it just vanished. On our way back home it was no where in the sky. My children were with me at the time and all of us saw the light.;38.6397;-75.6047
