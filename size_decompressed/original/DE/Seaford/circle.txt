I saw to circular objects very high in the sky. I could not determine their speed and at first I thought it was a satilite. The objects were very clost together almost connected and as they traveled west north west they simply dissapered. At first I thought that they had moved behind a high cloud, but along the track that the object was going I could still see stars. I knew the object did not disapear into clouds but I still waited for about 10 minutes to see if it would re-apear. It never did. As I thought about it I thought that it could have been  an air craft heading for the local airforce base with its landing lights on. But the object that I saw was not projecting light, it look like it was reflecting light just as a satilite would, but it was not at that altitude. Were I to guess the altitude I would say it was at between 8 to 10,000 feet. And with the aircraft heading for the local airforce base you can hear they as they pass. This object made no sound at all. As it dissapeared it faded dimmed once,then again and then was gone ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.
