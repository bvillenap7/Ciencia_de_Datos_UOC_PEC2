As I approuched I noticed that it was not moving. At this point I was scratching my head wondering what it could be. Then as I almost got under it, I noticed that it was just hovering not moving,(maybe about 1000' off the ground), so I pulled over and got out of the car looked up, it had 2 Bright white lights aiming straight out and was shaped like a stop sign with just 5 sides, dark in color maybe grey or black, and was silent not a peep of sound. Started to get a little nerves and had a delivery to make right down the street, so I jumped back in the car, made my delivey.When I was going back to the area I pulled over again to look, but it was gone, wanted to see how it moved.First time in my life I have ever seen a UFO.;38.6397;-75.6047
