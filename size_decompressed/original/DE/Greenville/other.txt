Discription would resemble a Straight Pin Such as a ball at one end. While attending what is known as Point to Point at Winterthur I was observing, through binoculars, all events of the day including horses, spectators and the helicopter over head covering the event from the air. While observing and following the helicopter through binoculars I noticed in the distance, beyond the helicopter what appeared to me for a split second to be a comet.  I quickly realized that this was not a comet for it was not moving in a horrizontal or vertical position and it also did not have any of the usual traits of what I know of a comet.  This object was brilliant gold in color. Had a ball shape on the left side followed by a long cone shape tail or body (needle like) that continued to a point on the right. Given the distance observed I would guess the length at around 200-300 ft. Object did not appear to be moving left,right or vertically. I observed this object for at least 00:45 realizing that yes this is a very strange shape, brilliant gold in color and not moving. Without changing direction, shape or color the object then seemed to just vanish by fading into nothing.  The weather was clear, blue skys with an occasional puffy cloud. ((NUFORC Note:  The report is a bit unclear to us.  We do not know if the witness implies a duration of 45 minutes, or 45 seconds.  Also, the sighting is not inconsistent with a contrail, seen in the distance, but that is only conjecture.  We do not know what the individual was witness to.  PD));39.7927;-75.6196
