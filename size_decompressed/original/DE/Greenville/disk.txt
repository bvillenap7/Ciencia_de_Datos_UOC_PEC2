White disc makes sharp turns and then shoots up as fast as lightning.;1990-06-01 12:00:00;30 seconds;White disc makes sharp turns and then shoots up as fast as lightning. A white colored disk, exactly the color of high clouds.  Moved in a zigzag formation and then shot up into space.  Was far up in the sky.  But it moved incredibly fast.  It was inconceivable that a craft was able to cover such a large span of space in less than 2 seconds.  It changed horizontal direction twice at precise turns of about 60 degrees.  Than made a vertical turn and shot up into space, again, at lightning speed. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));39.7927;-75.6196
