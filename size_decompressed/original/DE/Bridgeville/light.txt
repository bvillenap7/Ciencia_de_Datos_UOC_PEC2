A rapidly changing light in the sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probably a sighting of the star, Sirius.  PD));2008-03-05 23:45:00;45 Minutes;A rapidly changing light in the sky. I was traveling toward the West from Mid-Sussex County to Western Sussex when I noticed a light to the Southwest.  At first I thought it was a planet but then I noticed that it appeared to be twinkling.  It was a very clear night without any noticeable clouds in the sky and there was no moon. I kept watching it till I arrived at my destination.  Once there, I got out of the car and watched it for about 30 minutes longer. The light was moving slowly toward the western horizon.  It was bigger than a star.  It was flashing at a very fast rate and very randomly.  The color was changing about 3 to 4 times a second but with no discernable pattern.  There where not any solid colors and the colors seemed very random.  After a while it started moving from side to side.  This wasn't a huge movement.  About a half a finger width held at arms length.  It was still in the sky above a distant tree line when I stopped watching it.
