We then looked with binoculars and could see it was a disc shaped object with multi colored flashing lights.   It's still currently out back of our house visible from our bedroom window.  It has not moved again for a good 30 minutes.  I have used my compass on my phone to get the exact location as to where it is.;39.4850999999999;-75.6794000000001
