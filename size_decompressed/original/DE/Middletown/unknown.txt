Bright lights are seen for seconds then vanish after a house blocks view;2007-07-15 23:15:00;3-4 seconds;Bright lights are seen for seconds then vanish after a house blocks view Was on my way home, the road right before my road. It was a very very dark night. In the distance I noticed two extremely bright lights. I would say they were spaced probably about 50 feet apart. I saw them, then a house blocked my view and when I past the house it vanished. There were no blinking lights as on an airplane or helicopter. It wasn't stadium lights or construction work. The area it was spotted in is just grass / dirt. This is the second sighting I've had, and this one was very close to the other one back in 1999. I would say it was about 1/2 mile ahead of me. It almost resembled the other craft I saw before. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));39.4850999999999;-75.6794000000001
