Craft sighted in Delaware;2012-05-10 12:00:00;30 seconds;Craft sighted in Delaware I was driving over the old St. George's bridge in Middletown, Delaware when suddenly to the left hovering over the cornfield I saw a craft that was circular in shape and had a metallic look to it that almost looked like a liquid but you could tell it wasn't, best way to describe it was like a liquid mercury look but solid. At the time I see the craft I am actually above it or about even in height with it because I was on the bridge. Suddenly everything went silent no noise from the radio or anything and suddenly without sound or anything it darted off in a North East direction towards the power plants in the area of Delaware City and Port Penn, one of which is a nuclear power plant. As someone that studies science and have watched space launches I know that a vehicle moving that fast should have caused a sonic boom when it broke the sound barrier yet it was completely out of sight in a split second without causing a sonic boom or anything. I was in complete ! shock by this event and took several minutes just to compose myself to be able to talk because never in my life did I think I would see something like this as I am a skeptic but there's no denying what I saw on that day.;39.4850999999999;-75.6794000000001
