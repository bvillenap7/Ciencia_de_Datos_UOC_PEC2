Red flashing light moving at impossible speed at night in middletown DE.;2014-07-23 05:19:00;3 seconds;Red flashing light moving at impossible speed at night in middletown DE Bright red light traveling at a very high rate speed, seen over amazon in middle traveling south down 301.  The red light was leaving trails because my eyes could not keep up with its speed,  I have never seen anything travel this fast on this earth!  It was dark out and the craft or whatever it is had no white head light for seeing, only a  bright red light that seen to be very close because it appeared to be large in size.   It lasted for a very short duration and made no sound, either this light was leaving trails behind it or it had smaller red light traveling with it I'm not sure, but I can tell you, it shook me up a bit when I seen it.;39.4850999999999;-75.6794000000001
