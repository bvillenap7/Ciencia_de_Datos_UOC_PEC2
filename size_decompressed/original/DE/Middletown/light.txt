I have been an amateur astronomer for over forty years.   On Monday, May 30 at 10:50 P.M.   I stepped outside during a break in a show.  The weather was warm and humid, the sky was clear.   I noticed what I thought to be a meteor flashing overhead from the west.  The color of the object  was white-orange.   The object immediately made angular turn to the south, then two more after.  The object then proceeded to the west southwest at a very high rate of speed.  Total time observed was 6 to 10 seconds.;39.4850999999999;-75.6794000000001
