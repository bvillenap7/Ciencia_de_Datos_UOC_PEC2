It appeared to hover for approximately ten minutes which was enough time for me to smoke two cigarettes and to find our binoculars. Next it had made a very sharp right turn and took off faster than anything I’ve ever seen in my life. We looked at it through our binoculars and it had not resembled anything we’ve ever seen in our life. It definitely had not resembled a plane of any kind or a helicopter. There was absolutely no sound whatsoever.  The object seemed to be rectangular with two very bright lights. It was nighttime in a country like setting with not a lot of air traffic that passed through. It was a very clear starlit night.;38.9253;-75.5889
