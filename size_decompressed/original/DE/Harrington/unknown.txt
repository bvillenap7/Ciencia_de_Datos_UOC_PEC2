On the morning of June 1, I went for one of my weekly walks on Wednesday, and when I got into town, I was going to buy water and turn around and head home.  When I headed into the Harrington shopping center, I happened to glance up and see something odd. The object had pulsating blue, red, and yellow lights.  It was tumbling upward.  Not flying straight like an airplane or hovering like helicopter or drone.  It was tumbling in a way I’d never seen anything move before. I took a picture and a close up of it looks almost like a drone, but a later screen grab from my video has it looking like an orb with a light flashing on the side.  I don’t know what it is, and it really frightened me, so I wanted answers. I shared the video with friends and family.  Some say it was a drone.  The thing is, when I examined the video, there is a part where whatever it was “glitched” and it suddenly was somewhere else.  I didn’t see this with my naked eye at the time, only upon viewing the video.  I’ve never seen a drone move that fast.  Unless there was a problem with my phone during filming.  Anyway, this thing was tumbling and then it suddenly reversed until it was right over me. At that point, I stopped filming because I was startled. I live in a few miles an air base.  That does nothing to answer my questions because as I said, it looked like NOTHING I’d ever seen before.  Whether a civilian or military craft – and I see a lot of both on the regular.  This thing was tumbling, doing summersaults to rise higher in the sky.  I have simply never heard of any aircraft moving in that way to get from Point A to Point B and I just don’t know what to make of what I saw or filmed. Any help or answers would be appreciated.
