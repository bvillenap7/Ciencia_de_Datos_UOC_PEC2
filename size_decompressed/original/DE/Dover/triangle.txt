Evening sighting of UFO at two different locations.;1990-09-07 22:00:00;1:00;Evening sighting of UFO at two different locations. We were camping at a private camp ground when we heard a very strange sound and looked up to see what at first appeared to be a jet airplane passing by the campsite very slowly and at a very low altitude, as if it were landing. The sound was very foreign and did not sound like any aircraft either of us had ever heard. Then the craft became silent and seemed to disappear over some trees. We then went out to a nearby field to see if we could figure out what it could have been & where it went. We saw nothing for a long while. As we decided to go back to our campsite I noticed what appeared to be a falling star. I pointed out the location I saw the light drop when all of a sudden a craft slowly approached us. It was triangular in shape and huge as it came to a stop right in front of us, almost above us. We noticed that it made no sound whatsoever. My friend noted that is did not have any flashing red light that all registered aircraft are required to display. Right after he stated that a large red light began to glow at the bottom, center of the craft. As soon as that occured we freaked thinking that the occupants may have heard us and responded. We then witnessed the craft swiftly drifted away silently then sped upward at what appeared to be a 45% angle until it went out of sight.;39.1576298429318;-75.5433293193716
1991 dover delaware.  triangular craft;1991-06-20 20:00:00;3-4 hours;1991 dover delaware.  triangular craft wound up camping on private farm in delaware after finding the beach full.  surrounded by lake on one side and corn field on the other.  friend and i were sitting on picnic table under some trees right at dusk when we heard a slight whine noise.  friend asked what it was when we both looked up and discovered craft right above the trees.  looked triangular with light at corners.  and big.  it was moving slowly and we started running after it until we got to the edge of the lake. then we just watched in awe as it slowly moved away.  while we were following it i kept saying it doesn't have any blinking lights, none.  that was stuck in my head the whole time because in my mind i thought it couldn't have been a plane.  when we turned around i expected to see the other campers to be there too but to my shock nobody else was there.  like they didn't see it or thought it was a plane or what i don't know.  i just remember being really surprised that no one else ran after this thing like we did.  so we walked back to our site and sat and thought about it.  we decided to go out into the corn field(already harvested) and try to call it back using telepathy.  we thought it could read our mind.  it just seemed that way. so i check the time-it's approx. 9:30pm-and we walk out there about a quarter mile or so and we are both facing towards our site, in the direction we saw it go.  we just stand there meditating on calling this thing back.  neither one of said a word until we both turned around at the same time and looked off in the other direction.  there was a tree line about a mile away with field in between the trees and us.  just for an instant i looked down at my shoes or the ground and right then my friend says there it is!.  i looked up but did not see anything and said where?.  he repied watch!  then, a couple of seconds later, i saw it come over the tree line off in the distance.  i couldn't believe it.  i couldn't tell what it was but it did look like the same craft and it seemed to be moving slowly.  my heart was pounding. i got really scared.  i don't think i've ever been scared like that.  standing out in the middle of nowhere with this thing coming up to us.  so it got close to us and it seemed like it slowed down until it got directly over our heads.  then it moved passed.  and when it passed it showed this huge red light and i swear it did that for me to show me that it knew what i was thinking. then a car pulled in and started heading towards the camping area. (from the entrance to the camping area was about 2 miles).  we got scared so we ran all the way back.  the car pulled in and didn't stop.  they just left.  we thought they might have been following the craft.  it sure looked that way.  from the time we went out in the field to the time we got back only about half an hour had gone by, maybe 40 min., but when i checked the time it was 1:30 in the morning.  that's over 3hrs. unaccouted for and both of us were shocked and scared.  we didn't get any sleep that night.  the next day when we drove out of there we noticed the name of this area is called thomas landing. my name is thomas.  i thought that was weird.  also when we got back on a major highway we had passed dover air force base.  we both thought that was weird also and considered making a report but chose not to.  we went home to pa..   there are other pertinent details that i left out.  minor but significantly and coincidently relative to this account.  p.s. when i asked my friend how he knew it was about to come over the trees, he said he saw it shoot down from the sky to behind the trees.

Triangle aircraft, silent, 3 lights on the bottom, no flashing lights moved in directions no airplane could ever move and landed;1995-08-14 01:00:00;1 minute;Triangle aircraft, silent, 3 lights on the bottom, no flashing lights moved in directions no airplane could ever move and landed This is over 24 years past due, but in 1995, 3 friends and I were in my car at a place in Dover called Crybaby Bridge.  It's a place where people would hang out, since Dover had no place for young people to hang out at.  I have been skeptical for so many years because there is an Air Base really close to where this happened to, so I felt it was something base-related.   It was a triangular craft, had 3 lights, NO flashing lights at all.  The lights were arranged in a triangular pattern on the bottom of the craft.  Each edge of the triangle was semi-curved. It made NO noise at all.  Sitting in the vehicle, we watched this craft appear at seemingly nowhere high in the sky then lower itself.  We watched this craft move in directions that no aircraft could do - it would move West, then suddenly move Northeast after a few seconds, then head Southeast, then Northwest, and it suddenly went Southeast and traveled a little distance then went straight down behind the treeline. This transpired in about 1 minute.  This happened maybe 5 miles from the air base.  We could see residual light from the 3 white lights on the underneath portion of the triangular object at the ground from the area.  As soon as we saw this, we took off--driving some 100MPH to escape out of fear.  Everyone in the vehicle unanimously wanted to flee.;39.1576298429318;-75.5433293193716
11-03-2000: Large Stealth Style Craft Hovers Near Delaware Highway 113 (milemaker 46.5);2000-11-03 19:40:00;3 minutes;11-03-2000: Large Stealth Style Craft Hovers Near Delaware Highway 113 (milemaker 46.5) My family was driving south on route 113 (mile marker 46.5) in Delaware, when we saw bright airplane lights in the distance approximately 2 miles away.  We Continued to drive towards the lights, which appeared to be a plane flying too low.  As we approached the lights, we thought they might be from an athletic field, however as we approachedk even closer, we could clearly see a Stealth shaped aircraft (except that the ends of the wings curved inward toward the fusilage).  The aircraft appeared to be approximately the size of a passenger jet (big!!).  The aircraft hovered in mid air, approximately 200 - 300 feet off the ground, as we passed within 200 feet of its location over a field on the side of the highway, near a stand of trees.  There was no sound we could hear over the road noise of our van.  We were very exited and I turned our van around in the highway median and went back for another look.  The aircraft moved across the road in front of us and off in a northeast direction.  We lost sight of the aircraft as we drove by a stand of trees, and when we cleared the trees, the aircraft was gone.  The aircraft appeard to have three lights on the front of each wing which projected from the nose of the aircraft.  There was also a red blinking light in the middle of the plane.  At the time, we were six miles or so from the Dover Air Force Base. I think this may have been an experimental military jet, but I have never heard of a jet this large capable of hovering like a Harrier Jet.  Also, the lack of any discernable sound intrigued us.  We wanted to pass this sighting along in case others also report this sighting.  There were many cars on the road at the time, and we are sure that many other drivers must have seen the aircraft.  I reported the sighting to the Delaware State Police the next morning. I am hoping that someone can identify this sighting as a specific military airplane, as we are interested in researching this aircraft.  Maybe its not as uncommon as we think, but we've never hear of, or seen anything like this. Thanks, ((name deleted));39.1576298429318;-75.5433293193716

Triangle shaped aircraft hovering low in a field off Route 1 South;2002-08-30 21:05:00;6 minutes;Triangle shaped aircraft hovering low in a field off Route 1 South It was Friday night and I was heading south on Route 1 towards the Delaware beaches for Labor Day weekend. I was on my cell phone with my girlfriend when I saw something resembling stadium lights in a field where no such thing belonged. I pulled over about 1000 feet south of it. It was a triangle shape, and had numerous white lights. It was hovering approx. 200-300 feet off the ground, and didn't make a sound. I was about 6 or 7 miles from the Dover Air Force base, but no craft I know of could hover still like this. After about two minutes it very slowly made its way across the road, heading NE. I quickly hopped in my car and made a U-turn, but it disappeared over some trees. Many other people were on the road and I'm sure someone else saw it. I didn't report it to the local police, because I didn't think anyone would believe me. I arrived at my house an hour later, where my stepbrother and his girlfriend were waiting. He had been 15-25 min. ahead of me and he said they saw the same thing. At first I thought he was taunting me, but I soon realized he was telling the truth. While searching this site for related sightings I came across a very similar report from two years ago in the same area (http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/S14819.html). Word for word its exactly what I experienced. I'm wondering if this has been going on for awhile in this area. Maybe its some experimental aircraft, but why would you hover by a main road on Labor Day weekend if you wanted to keep it a secret?;39.1576298429318;-75.5433293193716
Floating Airliner?;2006-05-21 20:00:00;3 minutes;Floating Airliner? My girlfriend and I were travelling down Route 1 heading toward Ocean City Maryland.  We had just passed Dover AFB minutes earlier and were south on Route 1 when I noticed what seemed to be a large tower with multiple lights on it from a distance.  As we got closer, my girlfriend thought it was another plane coming in to land (it had blinking lights) but neither of us could see it moving.  As we got almost underneath it, we noticed that the object was stationary and making no noise.  It was getting dark so we could only barely see the outline of the object, which seemed to look like a large commercial airliner.  However, it was not moving, only hovering!  It also made no noise.     As we drove by, we noticed other cars viewing the object but no one pulling over.  It was one of the weirdest things I had ever seen.

Silent, triangular craft hovering over a field within one mile of airforce base;2007-01-23 22:30:00;5 minutes;Silent, triangular craft hovering over a field within one mile of airforce base I'm filing this report for my girlfriend, as she does not wish to be involved or identified (nor do I for that matter, but when I saw that there are other, very similar cases which have occurred in the same area in recent years, I felt it was my duty to file something on her behalf). She was driving from Philadelphia to the Delaware beaches on southbound Route 1 and passed the Dover Air Force Base in Dover, Delaware.  Having commuted at night for nearly two decades, she is familiar with the air base's lit-up landing strip of lights (which flash during inclement weather) off the left side of the roadway.  She noticed that the lights were off that night. When she was about a mile south of the air base, she noticed a large, triangular craft over a field off the right side of the highway.  (There are several miles of fields and marshes just past the air base off both sides of the highway.)  There were white lights on both sides of the object, yet no airplane beacon below it.  (She has worked with airplanes.)  It was silent.  She couldn't tell what altitude it was at, thus making it impossible to judge the size, whether it was 200 feet, 500 feet or 1,000 feet in length. She kept watching it for several miles as she continued driving and wondered why it was making such a slow decent and why it wasn't landing faster.  She eventually came to the perplexing conclusion that it was hovering, despite the fact that it obviously wasn't a helicopter. She has never seen a UFO and believes it was possibly an experimental military aircraft.;39.1576298429318;-75.5433293193716
Large, silver flying object with light beaming down.;2009-02-22 22:30:00;5 minutes;Large, silver flying object with light beaming down. A few weeks ago, my boyfriend and I were on our way to the beach for a special occasion.  We left around 9:00 p.m. so we didn't have to deal with all the traffic, it's about a 2 hour drive from where we live.  On the way there we were on the empty highway, and we saw something about 100 feet away from us.  At first we thought it was a large road light but as we got closer we realized it wasn't.  It was silver with red lights along the bottom and shaped like an arrow, hovering about 25 feet above the ground with a light beaming down.  There was a small building beneath it, where the light was shining. We pulled over to the side of the highway to get a better look, but as soon as we did this it sped away and was gone.  There is no way a plane could have flew away that quickly. In only about 5 seconds after it started moving, it was completely out of sight.  There were no trees around or anything else that could have blocked the view. I was told that planes cannot stay in one place while in the air and this thing had definitely been there for awhile before we got close. I looked on the internet for any other possible explanation of what it would have been, but have yet to find anything close.  I never believed stories about possible UFO sightings, but after this experience my outlook has changed.;39.1576298429318;-75.5433293193716
A triangular shaped hovering object with green and red lights;2011-11-11 20:00:00;15-20 seconds;A triangular shaped hovering object with green and red lights I was inside my house when I heard a loud rumbling sound coming from outside.  I saw something outside in the sky through one of our very tall windows so I ran outside to take a look.  About 30ft above some tall trees I saw a triangular shaped object with green and red lights all over hovering in the distance. In each corner of the object were cylinder shaped engines.;39.1576298429318;-75.5433293193716

Four lights flying in triangle formation.;2012-12-01 19:00:00;20 seconds;Four lights flying in triangle formation. At roughly 7:pm eastern standard time, I observed four dim white lights flying west. They were in a triangle formation with three lights forming one side.  The longest side of the triangle ran parallel to the flight path of the object or objects.  The lights were steady, not blinking.  The object/s were silent, fast moving and maintained a perfect formation until they dissapeared. It may have been a single object, but I think it was four.;39.1576298429318;-75.5433293193716
My boyfriend and I we’re headed is south on Route , somewhere around 10 p.m., just a few miles past Dover Air Force Base when my boyfri;2019-01-28 22:00:00;20 minutes;My boyfriend and I we’re headed is south on Route, somewhere around 10 p.m., just a few miles past Dover Air Force Base when my boyfriend asked me to try and figure out what this thing is on the right side of the road.  It was low to the ground (about as high as a water tower), and about as big as a very large water tower.  It had three very bright lights that appeared to be shining downward, one on each end of the wing, and one at the nose.  It also had flashing red and green lights at the rear, almost like antennas.  It was in the shape of a stealth airplane, but it was hovering completely still.  I didn’t think to wind my window down, but I didn’t hear a single sound, so it definitely wasn't an airplane or helicopter.  It didn’t make any wind either.  I thought for sure I would see something holding it up like it was built there, but there definitely was nothing underneath it.  Other than the two wings, it almost looked hollow from underneath, but it was hard to tell because the lights were so bright. We continued to drive up the road a few miles in awe over what we just saw when we decided to turn around and go back to look at it again, but it wasn’t there anymore.  We then turn back around heading south again,  a few miles past where we had seen it the first time, we saw it again but it was farther away and a little bit higher this time and it was moving slowly.  Still no wind coming from it. I tried to video tape it but because it was dark the only thing you can see were the lights.  We pulled off a side road so that we could watch it.  It moved like a drone going forward and sideways very smoothly.  It was traveling away from us at the speed of let’s say maybe a helicopter until we couldn’t see it anymore. We got back on Route 1 headed South again.  I started to notice other blinking lights much higher in the sky.  They weren’t stars by any means and there were a lot of them!  There weren’t any clouds in the sky and it was a crystal clear night.  All the blinking lights seem to be headed East toward the ocean.  I continued to see these blinking lights all over the sky our entire drive to Ocean City, MD. At first we thought maybe it was a lookout tower of some sort when we first saw it, but there definitely was nothing holding it u, and again it was no longer there when we came back.  We also thought it would make sense if it was something from the Air Force Base, but it did not fly like an airplane or a helicopter and there was definitely no air flow from it.  And then seeing all the other blinking lights in the sky heading out towards the ocean definitely made it clear that this was nothing out of the ordinary!  I am completely sane, and no, i don't do drugs.;39.1576298429318;-75.5433293193716
