It was about 2AM, and we were just approaching the Dover Airforce base, Off to our right was a clearing and about 200 feet in the air was a giant craft the only way I can explain it would be as a flying football field, being dark I could see the outline, and many lights spread out through the bottom of it. I said to my friends did you see that it looked like a UFO, they said its the Airforce base dummy. As far as I know we have no planes that size or shape. It did not move an inch, it was hovering in place. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));39.1576298429318;-75.5433293193716
