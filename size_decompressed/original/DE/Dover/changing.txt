Bright light changed shapes, multiplied, and faded out.  ((NUFORC Note:  Star??  PD));2009-04-19 04:00:00;1 hour;Bright light changed shapes, multiplied, and faded out. Witnessed bright circular object Northwest of sky with stream of light beaming towards the east of it (this was when I first witnessed the object-trying to dismiss it as just the moon.  With the changing shapes, I now beleive it to possibly be a retangluar shaped object).  The stream of light merged back into circular light, then faded out.  The circular light then re-apeared, a smaller circular light emerged from the original cicular light and hovered above the bigger circle.  Another circular light formed above the second one for a total of 3.  The 3rd faded out, a few seconds later, the second faded out, then the orginal one faded out.  The object reapeared a few seconds later in the shape of a long rectangle or cigar.  This object was high and had no noticable definition, however was extremely bright white.  These same changes maintained themselves for an hour changing shapes, mulitplying and fading out. ((NUFORC Note:  Star??  PD));39.1576298429318;-75.5433293193716
