Low flying extremely fast dull yellow/white diamond shaped object heading South. Dover De.;2005-12-18 22:05:00;6 seconds;Low flying extremely fast dull yellow/white diamond shaped object heading South. Dover De. I was outside having a smoke, It was clear and dark. I was standing on my back porch facing North and watched very fast,low flying diamond shaped object traveling from North to south, and to the west of my position.  It flew strait, deliberate,  below commercial traffic, but above the trees and silent. It was a dull yellow-white in color. No blinking lights.   It was way faster than a than a jet but slower than a falling star. It had no flame tail or contrail.  It disappeared from my sight behind the tree line but just below a commercial airliner at altitude heading South-West.
