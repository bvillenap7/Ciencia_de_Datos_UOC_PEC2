Airplane vanished and reappeared while hovering;2017-04-17 16:30:00;2 minutes;Airplane vanished and reappeared while hovering Driving north on RT 1 just south of Dover, DE.  Clearly an airplane was visible low in the skyline.  I was looking exactly at it and it just vanished.  I said to my wife ((deleted--what)) was that...next thing I know it reappeared.   Then I noticed that this full size plane was hovering not even a few hundred yards over a field.  It literally hovered for a couple mins as we approached the location to our right.  It did not move as we approached or while we passed.  We eventually lost sight of it after we went past the location.   I am of a clear mind and without a doubt it was the weirdest thing I have ever witnessed and I know for a fact that what I have described is 100% accurate.;39.1576298429318;-75.5433293193716
