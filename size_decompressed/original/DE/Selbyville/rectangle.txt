Bright light in the sky over the trees, a rectangular shape.;2017-08-14 17:20:00;5 seconds;We were on our way home from work when I looked up and said “WHAT IS THAT?” . It was a bright light in the sky over the trees, a rectangular shape.  My husband looked up and said, “Did you see that?”   I was trying to keep an eye on it, when a tractor pulled out and then the trees got in the way. By the time we came to a clearing it was gone.   We have never seen anything like that before. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date above is approximate.  PD);38.4654;-75.1573
