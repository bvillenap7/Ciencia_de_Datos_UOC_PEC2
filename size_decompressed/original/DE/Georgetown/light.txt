Falling stars do not do figure eights.;2000-06-22 23:00:00;3 seconds;Falling stars do not do figure eights. The sky was relatively clear, except fot the street lights and the thin clouds left over from the previous days rain. I was sitting on my front step having a beer after work.  A meteor fell from the north/northwest...into a figure eight and exited as it had entered. It made no sound. The entire event lasted for about three seconds.;6.80099999999999;-58.1704
