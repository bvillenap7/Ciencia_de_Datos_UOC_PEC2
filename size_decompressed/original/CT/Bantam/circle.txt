Circular object with White around it and yellow in the middle.;1975-08-01 13:00:00;10 minutes;Circular object with White around it and yellow in the middle. I lived on Bantam lake and I was down at the (Brunetto Grove) beach area with one of the neighborhood dogs (Rusty).   All of a sudden this circular object showed up.  It was hoovering over the water about 6 feet from me.  The size was 4 x 4 ft. The dog saw it because he was barking at it.  The outside of color was white and the inside was yellow.   I started talking to it saying hi who are you and it said nothing just continued to hover.  Then it started to bounce over the water, went up over the trees by point folly and zipped out of site.   I don't know what it was as it didn't make any noise and it was just bouncing.  I do know that a few days later, their was a siting of a UFO in CT.  I know what I saw and I will never explain it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));41.7189;-73.2526
