Also up in the trees I saw a cluster of glowing, strobe-like flashing, and then twinkling lights, getting brighter then dimming,changing colors, with no sound.   At first I thought they were fireworks, but they were NOT fire works.  They stayed in the exact spot for an hour.This is not the first time I have seen these.  A few days ago, I saw 2 fireballs behind my house. (I looked out the window when I noticed lights in the woods)  They quickly came into view above the trees at a very high speed, leaving a contrail like a comet.  They then appeared to play and moved around in the back yard, and I noticed at the same time there was the cluster in the tree in a similar spot, and height as last night.  The small balls of light also came by the window and flashed.  It seemed as though they were watching and observing me.  Then they just disappeared, orbs and cluster in trees.;41.7189;-73.2526
