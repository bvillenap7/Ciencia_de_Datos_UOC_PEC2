Massive Bright Light.;2019-08-23 22:05:00;5 minutes;Massive Bright Light When it gets dark, I usually go outside and star gaze even if its just a few minutes because space and astronomy has always been an interest of mine.  I was outside on my back deck at around 10:05pm when I noticed what appeared to be an incredibly large bright star.  The object was at an altitude of about 45 degrees with an azimuth of about 210 degrees (North being 0 degrees).  The most noticeable feature was the incredible luminosity radiating from the object.  There was no way anyone could of missed this thing, it stuck out like a soar thumb from the rest of the stars.  I was fixated on it for about 5 solid minutes racking my mind on what I was looking at.  Too big to be a star, much to small to be the moon.  I know that some celestial objects can be seen with the naked eye, such as Mars and Venus, and can appear brighter then most stars.  Remembering I have the Night-Sky app on my Ipad I walked in my house, grabbed a drink, grabbed my tablet and headed back outside.  Ready to hopefully make some sense of what I've been observing with the help of the Night-Sky app I finally look up where the object was and it was gone.  I was in my house for only about 3 minutes max.  For some reason I had the feeling it was waiting for me to go inside. I swear every word of this is true.  I never reported anything like this before but this experience was so strange I felt compelled to report it.  Also maybe by me reporting my experience then someone else that saw the same thing that night will report it and we will be a step closer to understanding what's happening.;41.8872000000002;-72.1436000000005
