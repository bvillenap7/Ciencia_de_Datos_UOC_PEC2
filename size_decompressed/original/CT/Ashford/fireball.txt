Ten fireballs traveling in a straight line across the horizon;2013-10-06 19:30:00;15 minutes;Ten fireballs traveling in a straight line across the horizon I was standing outside at roughly 19:30 when I noticed an orange fireball traveling across the sky in a straight horizontal line.   Just a few moments later, through the trees I noticed another fireball that appeared to be the same size as the first traveling in the same horizontal line.   Having never seen a UFO before in my life, I was surprised to see two back to back.   Within minutes more of the orange fireballs traveled across the horizon until I witnessed ten altogether.  They appeared to be evenly spaced by several hundred feet and all were traveling in the same direction.   One of the ten seemed to lose altitude rapidly, and quite possibly could have crashed, but that did not deter the trailing UFO.   There was no sound from any of the ten UFOs.   There were many planes flying in the air at the same time, so it was easy to distinguish the UFOs from the usual air traffic.;41.8872000000002;-72.1436000000005
