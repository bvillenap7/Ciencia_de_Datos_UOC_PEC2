Triangle large hovering object above I-84 East exit 72.;2017-12-21 06:25:00;5-10 minutes;Triangle large hovering object above I-84 East exit 72. Driving to Worcester, MA, on I-84 before exit 72 Ashford/Waterford at 6:25 am, I noticed from a distance a large object in sky above 84 East.  It seemed like a huge drone with white blinking lights on the sides and what seemed to be a green light in front.   At first from a distance I thought it was a cell tower light until I got closer and realized it was hovering above the highway.;41.8872000000002;-72.1436000000005
