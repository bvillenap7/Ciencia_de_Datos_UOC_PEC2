2 tiny objects moving in the sky;2019-07-12 23:00:00;Minutes;2 tiny objects moving in the sky My daughter and I were looking at URSA major and URSA minor.  The moon was behind some trees to the left.  We saw an airplane pass.  Then I saw a tiny dot moving through the sky, then my daughter saw it.  I have the starwalk app and it did not detect the moving object as a satellite.  The object moves behind a house where we can no longer see it.  Then we see a second one, similar in every way.;41.9165;-71.8921
