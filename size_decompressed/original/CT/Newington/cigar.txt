My fiance ran inside to get to her camera and I ran towards the road.   I witnessed the object stall for a brief second then travel towards the moon at a rapid pace then disappear.

It was oblong almost cigar shaped and bright orange.  As it moved in the sky, I ran to get my camera, my fiance ran towards the object.  When I came back outside it had flown towards the moon and just disapeared.  We saw it for almost 30 seconds and both have never seen an aircraft move that fast and change direction that quickly, with a distinct glowing oragnge color.
