Looking up at the moon a this red line with a slight oval glow to it appeared in the sky.  The coloration was very bold. it sat still in the sky for about 8 seconds.  The glow increased in size, like it was swelling and then SHOT across the sky.  When it projected itself forward the front of the craft turned a light blue color and it left a broad red lightstream its trail that as it continued looked like two solid red beams of light.   Whatever this was went from standing dead still, to moving impossibly fast. dissappeared on the horizon and the trail of light looked like it gone turned off instantly.;41.6868;-72.7248
