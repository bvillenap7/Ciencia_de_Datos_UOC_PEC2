I slammed on the brakes and watched for a few seconds, and then it suddenly shot straight down to earth in about a split second.  So fast!   I drove around to the next street or two to see if I could see it again, but it was gone.   I would like to note that even though this deeply impressed me, I somehow forgot to tell anyone about it for two days.  When I remembered and told my husband, I was covered in goosebumps.  Very eerie and weird.;41.6868;-72.7248
