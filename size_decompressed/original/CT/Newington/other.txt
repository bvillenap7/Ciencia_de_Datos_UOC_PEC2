This event happened as I was facing east from my vantage point, it was very visible without binoculars, even though I was using 10x50 binoculars at the time, I could still only see the bright lights moving in formation nothing more, the lights were bright white, they were only visible to me for about 20 seconds then were gone, if anyone else saw this could you post what you saw and if you saw anything else. I was also hoping that maybe the people who run this site may be able to contact air traffic control towers in the area to see if any military events were scheduled at that time.;41.6868;-72.7248
