Bright solid white and blue orb over Newington.;2013-06-05 01:15:00;10 seconds;Bright solid white and blue orb over Newington. I was heading out from my apartment just after 1am.   I always look up into the sky at night upon going outside out of habit as I am an amateur astronomer.  I immediately looked up towards the south.  As soon as I did I instantly see a very bright orb in the sky headed from north to south.  I caught it roughly 10 seconds before it passed below the treeline.  It was not moving particularly fast.  It was very bright white with hard to make out edges almost like it had an aura surrounding it.  It appeared to be an orb in shape.  I also believe there was a slight tinge of blue light near the center of the mass.  All light being emitted from the object was bright, solid, and completely encompassing the entirety of the object.  I ruled out a meteor as it was moving too slow and was way too large.  I do not believe it to be an aircraft of any kind as aircraft have much smaller lights which typically blink as well as it did not produce any sound at all.  It also could not have been a satellite as it was producing its own light as well as being much too large again for it to be that.  The background of the night sky was completely clear if I recall correctly.  I was too engrossed with the object to pay much attention to the sky itself.;41.6868;-72.7248
