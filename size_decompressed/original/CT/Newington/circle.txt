Formation of shiney dots travels in same traffic lane as normal aircraft.;2001-03-20 16:00:00;20 minutes;Formation of shiney dots travels in same traffic lane as normal aircraft. I was looking up at the clouds and explaining to my 4 year old son that they move with the wind, when I noticed 2 white, shiny dots appear and then behind them, 2 more, they were moving in a northeast direction.  When I couldn't view them anymore I looked back at the cloud and there was one more that seemed to be following them in the same direction and I watched it until it disappeared.  These dots were moving fairly fast.  Faster than an aircraft would have at that altitude.  There are airplanes flying overhead all the time heading towards either Brainard Airport or Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks.  I went inside and called my mother to tell her of my experience and then went back outside about 10 minutes later.  I layed on the sidewalk watching the sky again and sure enough, I saw a bigger dot coming from the northeast heading southwest this time.  As I watched it it split up into a triangle shape with 3 of the dots at the angles and one of the dots kept going back and forth between the other 3 as if merging and then coming apart.  I am a very sane person and I tried to convince myself that what I was seeing was a flock of birds or some aircraft or anything but UFOs, but after watching these craft for about 5 minutes until they disappeared into the clouds, I can only say that I don't know what they were.  Just bright, shiny dots that seemed to move with a definate purpose.;41.6868;-72.7248
Orange ball after firework show;2007-07-21 22:00:00;30 Minutes;Orange ball after firework show My father and I were just leaving our towns firework display and we rode our bicycles. We went over 1 street when a random guy said Look up in the sky, a UFO! Sure enough there's a huge glowing orange ball. It moved so slowly. You had a feeling it wasn't normal. The guy said it was around 10 minutes before the fireworks. That was like 15 minutes ago. He also said it was moving really fast and stopping on a dime. After watching it for a few minutes my father and I heading on keeping an eye on it. We took our eyes off for less then 30 seconds and it was gone forever. But the odd thing was I saw like three or four planes in the area after.  And they stayed there for 10 minutes. And someones car engine died. But it was like an '04 And we told my sister and mom when we got home. You just knew it wasn't human, you just knew. Sadly we didn't have a camera.;41.6868;-72.7248
Silver Dots Above Clear Newington, CT Sky;2010-05-01 09:30:00;10 min;Silver Dots Above Clear Newington, CT Sky While I was standing outside at work looking at the beautiful clear sky I noticed two silver dots that appeared very high up, thought they may be birds but there didn't appear to be any movements like wings flapping, and there were phone pole wires close to me so I was kind of able to judge if the dots where moving  because they appeared just above the wire that I was using as a fixed point, they were moving closer to each other but never touched from what I could see. After about 10 min they started moving at a what seemed a slow speed, both together but not as a formation and I had to get back to work so I left. Maybe weather balloons? I don't know what they were, haven't told anyone. Never seen anything like them.;41.6868;-72.7248

Two large, bright , white lights traveling extremely fast in the same circular motion, opposite each other - loud whooshing sound  500;2011-10-23 06:15:00;About 3-4 Minutes;Two large, bright , white lights traveling extremely fast in the same circular motion, opposite each other - loud whooshing sound  500 10-23-11 Sunday morning got up at 6:07, headed outside to the backyard with the dog at around 6:10ish.  There was a lot of white gray cloud cover this morning.  There was a fairly loud, distinctive whooshing sound, I looked up into the northwest sky and saw two lights, two large, bright, white lights, traveling extremely fast in a circle, perfectly opposite each other, every one and a while crossing each others paths, but remaining in a circular motion – (the sound was not that of a helicopter or airplane and the speed the lights were traveling were extremely fast – and perfectly circular even when the every then and again the two lights would cross paths through the center, but while remaining in that circular formation)  I would have to say the size of the lights were very large, it would be hard to guess, as I was looking up from the ground but I would have to say at least the size of a house or school and the size of the circle would have to have been at lease the of a football field, but probably larger.  I stood there watching for at least four to five minutes, but had to go in to shower, when I went back outside the lights were gone (by 6:30a.m.).;41.6868;-72.7248
