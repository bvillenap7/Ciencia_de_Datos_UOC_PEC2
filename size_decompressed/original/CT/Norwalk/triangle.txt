Amber wing at treetop level, silent, low and slow.;1989-10-17 19:00:00;90 seconds;Amber wing at treetop level, silent, low and slow. In Oct. 1989, I was driving east on the Merrit Pkwy in Norwalk, getting off exit 38, when I saw it. As I approached the exit, it was going north on rte 123.  My exit to 123 looped around facing west at a stop sign.  It  sailed over my truck at 20 MPH, 120 feet up, about 75 feet wide, seemingly internally completely lit, color was amber. It was a delta-wing-like (silent) shaped craft, first impression was that it was a carnival in the sky. I still can see it in my mind.   Reported it by phone that night to CUFOS.  It glided over a now decommissioned National Guard Armory which was north of the Pkwy. It was not from any known neighborhood. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.

We have a home on direct waterfront at a point unobstructed in Rowayton ( Norwalk ) CT and have never seen anything like this!;2012-08-16 20:30:00;7 minutes;We have a home on direct waterfront at a point unobstructed in Rowayton ( Norwalk ) CT and have never seen anything like this! Witnessed 3 yellow/white lights that quickly turned into 3 reddish lights in a triangle over Sheffield Island, Norwalk, CT at 8:35 -8:41PM.  Lights were in a perfect triangle and were not moving initially.  Within a couple of minutes the three lights formed a straight line equidistant from each other.   Within a minute or so the lowest light disappeared, then the middle light disappeared, and finally the third and last light disappeared.   One light was visible through binoculars for about 15 seconds after all had disappeared to the naked eye.;41.1171899280576;-73.4230568345324

It was a clear enough night to see it was triangular in shape with no sound moving very slowly;2020-12-26 03:45:00;5 minutes;It was a clear enough night to see it was triangular in shape with no sound moving very slowly At approximately 3:45 AM on December 26th 2020 I had arose early and was having coffee at my desk when I noticed a triangular shaped object moving from west to east in a very slow manner.  While moving across the sky there were white and red lights that would blink on and off.  There was no sound and there were no other aircraft that I could see in the area.  There were no obstructions and the object was clearly visible and was definitely triangular in shape.;41.1171899280576;-73.4230568345324
