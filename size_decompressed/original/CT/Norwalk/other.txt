Red octagon shaped objected hovering and shortly after took off at high rate of speed.;2013-04-14 11:30:00;4 minutes;Red octagon shaped objected hovering and shortly after took off at high rate of speed Driving down the hill of a St. Mather Rd coming to the stop sign and as I was making the right turn on to West Norwalk Rd.  I immediately noticed a bright read object in the shape of almost on of cowboy hat or one of those fancy fedora hats.  Maybe a saucer shape with a large dome on top.   Once on the main road they was clear skyline view were I noticed the object, again with red slights at the bottom and slight tint of white lights above the red glow.  I stopped in the road to observe object as it was hovering over the distant tree lines. Now with no point reference I can't be sure how high up it was hovering, but I could tell the distance from me was maybe between 5-10 miles in my line of vision.   After about 1 minute the object started moving towards N-NE I followed till I got to the stop sign where the object was even clearer to see, but only for a brief second.  The the road i take home I was almost simiar to the direction the object was heading which was a  orth direction. Now the road I was on goes thru a section of heavy tall pines trees but shorty after I regained sight of the object where it was looked to be heading over a local park and business center. I got as close I coud to see the object hovering, but I as got closer to the area where i determined the object to be, it jettison North at a high rate of speed. I continued to drive around the local roads but as came around the corner the object was gone, and few seconds later I was able to come to a open view of the skyline but the object was gone. The most interesting thing about the object was the shape and the disticnt bright red light that went around the circumference of the object. It was dead silent not a plane or a private drone. It covered to much space to be a drone, I have read some info on the new craze of private drones. This did not fit such description as it was far to big.;41.1171899280576;-73.4230568345324
