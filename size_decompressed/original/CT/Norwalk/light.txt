Blinking Bright Star/object, at  lower alltitude than normal at stand still/ moving very subtully through the night sky.;2011-07-27 02:00:00;50 min;Blinking Bright Star/object, at  lower alltitude than normal at stand still/ moving very subtully through the night sky. The UFO appeared to be a a blinking star or a plan.  As I laid down in the bed it was descending in a weird fashion.  Then the UFO just stopped and was at a still rest.  As I watched it longer it would subtly move or rise.  After trying to wake my wife up, which failed, I left her a lone and watched for a bit more.  I knew it was not a plain when it stopped all movement.  I got back in the bed and tried to stay awake to see it depart.   I dosed off for a few minutes and it was gone.

About a dozen separate red lights flying slowly east then veering north.;2015-12-25 21:00:00;15-20 minutes;About a dozen separate red lights flying slowly east then veering north. About a dozen separate red lights with a smaller orange/dark yellow light on the port side. moving east from New Canaan area, then veering north over the Silvermine River. Sometimes moving slowly or hovering, sometimes three of them forming a triangle shape.   They were flying low though there was no discernible shape in the dark overcast sky, and there was no sound coming from them.   I tried to get photos but could not get my camera to work even after switching batteries, and I know how to use my camera.   This was reminiscent of a UFO sighting that occurred about five years ago, also on Christmas night at about the same time.  In the previous sighting about 12 craft, same description as above, flew in single file from the east then turned North over the river.;41.1171899280576;-73.4230568345324

It was one bright green light that appeared in the sky out of nowhere, and zigzagged across and up/down a small portion of the sky and disappeared a second or two later.   It appeared circular in shape because the very bright light was gone as quickly as it came. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.
