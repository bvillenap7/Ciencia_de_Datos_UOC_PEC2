The sighting took place at Veterans Park on 9/19/2009 at 8:05 pm and 51 degrees in Norwalk, Connecticut out in the Harbor. We were coming in the Harbor on our boat (4 people on board) from Sprite Island after a BBQ, with our friends following us in their boat(with 5 people on board), heading for the dock, when we noticed this exceptionally very large bright light over the harbor,that was a conical shape shining down. We watched to see is this was possibly a helicopter,or some other type of aircraft that was searching for something, but then the light started to go straight up into the sky until it was no longer visible. It left a slight vapor mist, that was white and hazy that evaporated. There was absolutely no noise, it was silent.That's when we knew it couldn't be a plane or helicopter,it did not fly forward, it flew straight up. The group of observers (being 9 total)ranged from Age 11 to 50. There were 4 children,2-11year olds, 1-12 year old, 1-13 year old,and the adults 1- advertising executive,1-marketing director,1-Interior designer, 1 Photographer,1-Guest visiting from Australia. We all saw this, this was no ones imagination. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));41.1171899280576;-73.4230568345324
