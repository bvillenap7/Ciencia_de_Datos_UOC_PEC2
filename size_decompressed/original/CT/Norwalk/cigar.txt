Strange lights in Norwalk, CT;1973-07-12 00:00:00;15 min;Strange lights in Norwalk, CT Me and my girlfriend were driving East, when we seen a light above the tree tops.  It was a bright light not moving so we pulled over and watched it for a few minutes, it then shot off to the South.  I was on my way to bring my girlfriend home and when we got to her house, her neighbor was outside in the middle of her field looking at the sky.  We asked her what she was doing that late and she said a light was hovering over her horse stables, and the horses were spooked and ran out.  She caught a bit of it and it stood there hovering for a few moments and then shot off.  It was something odd, and I know that I saw a UFO.  I don't khow if anyone else has seen this in our hometown at that time. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD));41.1171899280576;-73.4230568345324
