I was looking up at the cross, when I noticed a strange mist in the sky above.((NUFORC Note:  Rocket launch from Wallops Island. PD));2017-06-29 04:15:00;1-2 minutes;I'm an early riser and take a daily walk at 4:00 am. By 4:15 am, I was up the hill, by my son's old Catholic school, which has a clearing, and is wide open.  I was looking up at the cross, when I noticed a strange mist in the sky above. I thought it was the moon in a mist, and then a smaller misty sphere, next to it, which I thought might be its reflection.  Then four spheres of the same size popped into view, and then two more smaller ones popped in as well.  These six were perfectly sharp and clear and not misty.  They seemed to have colors (orange, yellow and blue) and shapes that I could sort of make out.  The same way they came in, they popped out, and then the sky was clear. I was awestruck.
