multi colored lights over some trees near downtown norwalk ct.;1980-07-10 21:00:00;10-15 seconds;multi colored lights over some trees near downtown norwalk ct. It was a warm evening and i was downtown with 4 friends of mine and we were about to get into a car but we were pre occupied looking at a few girls walking our way when out of the corner of my eye i caught a very large oval shaped multi colored flying object of in the distance...id say about 6 blocks away or it seemed that far...it was silent and i remember that because it was the first thing i noticed besides its colors and shape that really puzzled me because a plane or helicopter that far away would be noisy enough to hear...the sky was clear with no stars or clouds and i got the most eeriest feeling when i saw it...i happened to catch my friend leroy looking right at the same thing i was seeing...we looked at each other sort of stunned and didnt say anything until later when i pulled him aside to ask if he saw what i saw too....he admitted it but we were afraid to tell anyone due to there disbelief and i didnt want to be embarrassed....i never ever told anyone else about this and i am a sane person and know exactly what i saw that nite...i wasnt drinking or doing any drugs at all...it was a sight i will never forget.....it moved very slowly and was about about 60-70 yards above ground heading toward the groundwithin 10-15 seconds it disappeared behind some trees and i never saw it again....the lights were blue, green, white and red positioned all around the object evenly with a bright white light on top slightley higher then the others.....it was the creepiest experience i ever had and will never forget it!;41.1171899280576;-73.4230568345324
Oval Shaped Silvery Metallic Craft moving in a straight line very quickly.;1991-03-01 11:00:00;1 minute;Oval Shaped Silvery Metallic Craft moving in a straight line very quickly. My Mother and I were walking for exercise in the morning.  It was clear out with minimal clouds.  I looked up and saw a silver/silvery white object, oval shaped, gliding in the sky at a high rate.  No sound.  It moved perfectly straight and very fast but seemed like it was gliding and almost weightless.  I pointed to it and my mother saw it also.  We watched it for about a minute.  It was so bright in color (silver) that it almost seemed white.  No windows, pefectly oval, nothing like a plane or jet.  As it moved, it seemed surreal to be seeing this, I had never seen any object in the sky like this before (or since).
