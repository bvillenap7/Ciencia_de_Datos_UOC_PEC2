Large disc like craft observed hovering over Long Island Sound.;2015-02-13 19:00:00;20 minutes;Large disc like craft observed hovering over Long Island Sound. One large craft visible from the 7th floor of Norwalk hospital observed a few miles away hovering over Long Island Sound.  The craft had green blinking lights that appeared to be spinning around the craft itself.   I personally observed the craft hovering over the sound for 20 minutes or so.  But it could have been there longer prior to my seeing it.   I took a video of it with my phone.   Eventually I looked away from the window for a few moments and when I looked back the craft was gone.  This is the first time I have ever seen something like this in person.  I will never forget it.;41.1171899280576;-73.4230568345324
