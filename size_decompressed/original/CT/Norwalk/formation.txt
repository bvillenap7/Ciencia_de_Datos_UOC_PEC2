3 Objects meet in the sky, then fly off into different directions;2009-07-14 21:00:00;15 seconds;3 Objects meet in the sky, then fly off into different directions Looking up into the Southern sky, I saw THREE white dots converge at one point then they all shot off into different directions, one westerly, one easterly and one south. This event lasted about 15 seconds as I watched from the front window of my car.  I slowed down to watch the white dots meet at the same point, then as I was idling and still watching, they all shot off into different directions.  Clear, night time sky.
