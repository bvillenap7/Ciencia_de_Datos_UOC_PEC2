object displaying what appeared to be flames appeared out of the north at 1200-1500 feet;2000-12-11 17:18:00;3 minutes;object displaying what appeared to be flames appeared out of the north at 1200-1500 feet We had just gotten into the hot tub when my husband and I both noticed a very bright light coming towards us from the north. At first we thought it was a helicopter with unusually bright anti-collision lights, but the light wasn't white, it was yellow/orange, like a campfire. The size at first was approximately 3 to 4 times the size of Venus, which was visible in the west at that time. We turned off the radio to hear it, but there was no sound. As we watched, it gradually travelled south over the house, and we were still thinking it was a helicopter, but that is was on fire inside. As it travelled south, it gradually slowed down. A bit past our chimney, the object stopped, and just hovered in place for about 2 minutes, while we watched it flicker. There was no pulse or regularity to the flickering. The object began to move again, this time towards the northeast, and faster. Then it appeared to turn away from us.  The flames were no longer so easily seen, and it ascended and disappeared. We live in a very heavy aircraft traffic area, and this object did not display any normal navigation or anti-collision lights.;41.1171899280576;-73.4230568345324

very radiant object sitting in the sky, looks closer than a star;2009-09-02 05:20:00;about half an hour;very radiant object sitting in the sky, looks closer than a star This is my second time noticing a bright object sitting in the sky in the morning and it seems as if it's three dimensional and unlike other stars, i can see whats behind it.  Its the only thing in the sky that i can see.  It's very large and brighter than any star I've seen in the sky.  It's not moving but it's just sitting there.  I've seen the object before but didnt pay much attention to it until this morning.  It was visible at around 5:20am and was unable to be seen at 6am;41.1171899280576;-73.4230568345324
Yellow orange lights moving in the sky of Connecticut USA;2020-04-10 21:00:00;40 minutes;Yellow orange lights moving in the sky of Connecticut USA On Friday 10 of April 2020 at 9:00 pm I returned home from work.  I park my car and look at the stars and the sky was very clear but the color of the stars was orange and started to move.  As I kept looking there were more orange lights moving in line.  Other in circles.  It was very impressive.  I called my wife and told her to look at the sky and she saw the same thing.  What an experience..;41.1171899280576;-73.4230568345324
