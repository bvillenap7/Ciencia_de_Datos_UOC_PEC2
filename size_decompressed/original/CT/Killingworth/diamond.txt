I looked up and as it approached closer I saw 4 lights underneath it and it would every so often turn on this really bright beam.  Then turn it off.  It crossed over above, I pulled over and tried to watch it but there are too many trees so I didn't get to see it long.  It was heading ummmm I think it would be west.;41.3723;-72.5749
