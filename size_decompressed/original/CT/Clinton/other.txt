I was at my storage unit and looked at the horizon for no reason when I noticed a blinking white light. The light was different and it did not compare to anything I have seen at this location. I am very familiar with the air traffic at this location because I have been coming here for years and have seen all types of air traffic at all times of day and night in all types of weather.  I sensed something about this light and decided to get my camera.It acted too different so I knew it was interesting shortly after seeing it.I use a Flip Digital camera and was not sure if it would even pick it up.  I filmed it and I became more interested and decided to get my binoculars so as to see if this was something I could identify.  I put my camera down and viewed it. When I finally found it in my viewfinder it rose at a somewhat 45 degree angle and either imitated a planes lights or placed itself behind a plane, it seemed to me it had done something deceptive.  I watched what now looked like a standard flashing plane (jet)lighting pattern and it continued on a lateral course until I became bored and stopped watching.;41.2929;-72.526
