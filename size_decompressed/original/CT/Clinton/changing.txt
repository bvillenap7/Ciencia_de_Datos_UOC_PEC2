There were also tons of cars in the highway, so I'm sure my mother and I are not the only ones who've seen this.  Out of nowhere to my left appeared these tiny orange lights, at least 15 of them.  First they were in a few S formations then a large triangle then just a blob I guess you could say.  I couldn't take a picture because I was driving 70 mph and my mother isn't extremely tech savvy.  It seemed that they were just hovering, as i said i was driving 70mph and no matter how far i drove they were still above me.   Within 4 minutes, I had suddenly passed them and they vanished.  I had the most eerie feeling and have checked the papers today and there's no mention of any explanation.  I may not know what they were but i know that it was not a bunch of planes, shooting stars or meteors. I can't stop thinking about those lights!!;41.2929;-72.526
