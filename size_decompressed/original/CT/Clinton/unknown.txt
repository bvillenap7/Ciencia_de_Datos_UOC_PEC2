A gold,yellowish light going across the sky in space... up with the stars!;2007-09-26 04:38:00;40 SECONDS;A gold,yellowish light going across the sky in space... up with the stars! Stepped out earlyin the morning to check weather and smoke a cigar and as i always do look up and look at the stars. I know the difference between airliners,planes etc. No strobes, no red, no green nav lights. Higher than any aircraft of any kind. This was in SPACE traveling past us. Going very fast.

It was a gold color but up very high like in space. No strobes, red, green lights.;2009-09-17 20:19:00;20 seconds;I am starting to see the lights in the sky again. It was a gold color but up very high like in space. No strobes, red, green lights. A plane was not very far behind it. May have been chasing. I am sure pilot would have seen it at least on radar. Yes could have been a satellite but I do not think so. I am going to start to have the camera and camcorder near by. I could not get it fast enough. I have had it ready but my wife took it back upstairs to store. Really screwed me up. I will try to have a picture next time. They come and then they stop. once I see one I will start seeing them a lot. Then they go away again for a while.  Thanks;41.2929;-72.526
