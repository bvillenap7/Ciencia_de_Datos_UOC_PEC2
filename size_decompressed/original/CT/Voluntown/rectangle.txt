rectangular object with 4 bands of light;2007-09-07 22:30:00;seconds;At approximately 22:30  on September 7, 2007 my girlfriend and I decided to go for a walk out to the open field in the middle of the camping/forest area at Pachaug State Forest in Voluntown, CT. We went out and proceeded to sit on the rocks surrounding the outside of the field at the Mount Misery campground portion of the forest.  The night was perfectly clear and there were no clouds nor was the moon visible. There weren't any planes either, just a sky full of stars. I was looking up at the Southwest portion of the clearing and my girlfriend had her back to where I was looking and was walking towards me, when out of nowhere a rectangular object with 4 bands of light ranging from red, orange, yellow and pink appeared in the sky roughly about a football field length away from me over the tree line on the other side of the field. It was low flying and above the tree line but not by much. It started out small, about 1 school bus in length and about 3 in height [relative for that distance away. that is the best measurement I could think of]  and then when it moved from right to left in the sky it expanded to about 3 school busses in length.  I shouted for her to turn around but when she did it disappeared from site.  I got pretty freaked out and proceeded to walk back to our campsite. I at first tried to convince myself that it was a shooting star but after talking to my girlfriend for a bit we came to the conclusion that what I saw was a possible UFO. We noticed that soon after what I saw, several planes were flying over the area about a half hour later.;41.5834;-71.8576
