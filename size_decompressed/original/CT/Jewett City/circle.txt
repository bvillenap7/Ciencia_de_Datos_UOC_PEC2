An unusually bright object in the sky made a series of zig-zags and disappeared.;2013-06-30 23:45:00;1 minute;An unusually bright object in the sky made a series of zig-zags and disappeared. When I have trouble falling asleep, I like to look at the stars and the various constellations in the sky. The time was approximately 11:45pm, or possibly later. I noticed in the North or Northeastern part of the sky there was a very bright object. At first I thought it was Venus, the brightest object in the sky, but the object seemed brighter than Venus normally is, and slightly larger than Venus would be. The object remained completely still for about 30 or 45 seconds, and after that it made a series of fast zig-zags in the sky and disappeared. It was then that I realized I saw a UFO. Unfortunately since the sighting was in approximately 2013 (perhaps later or earlier), I cannot remember additional details about the sighting, such as specific characteristics of the object.;41.6062;-71.9795
