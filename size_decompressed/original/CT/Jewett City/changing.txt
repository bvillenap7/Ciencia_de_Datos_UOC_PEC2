We used stable binoculars to look closer and noticed that it was changing both color and shape.  It was continually bright white and would occasionally have blue and red ends.  At one time it changed into three oblong white balls and would return to it's original shape.  Several times it almost looked like a pyramid.  Before it was gone the three white balls moved up and down.  There was always a cloud next to it that changed into a ball also.  It was gone it an instant and we noticed that there was a wide white streak across the sky that stayed for quite a while.  It was much too low and too wide to be a contrail.  Went from NW to NE.;41.6062;-71.9795
