Bright, Red, Illuminated sky, at 3:30 am.;2018-09-29 03:30:00;ongoing;Bright, Red, Illuminated sky, at 3:30 am I've lived here 33 years, i now the landscape, i've reported odd military drills before, I've reported fireballs and shooting stars different astronomy groups before.  This i've never seen before.  I'm, used to second and third shift life style so i'm always up late in the night, but this, no, never seen it before. Beyond the trees, in the direction of Hampden, Mass., directly north of us, and emanating from the sky, not the ground, the sky is an reddish orange color, and emanating enough light, for me to see the silhouette of the trees, while the moon, is behind us high in the sky with a blueish tint. I will enclose 3 pictures from an iphone 5, 2 in the backyard, and one from the front of the house, with porch lights, and house lights on, and yet this red light is seen behind the house, causing a silhouette of the house. I live in the woods, we never have light pollution like this there is no city in that direction, it's nothing but small towns, and woods in that direction.;42.0016;-72.4597
