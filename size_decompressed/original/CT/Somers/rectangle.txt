Object with 4 light beams and high pitch grinding sound in the Connecticut/Massachusets border line on 9/3/2001, 5:16 am.;2001-09-03 05:16:00;5 -10 secs;Object with 4 light beams and high pitch grinding sound in the Connecticut/Massachusets border line on 9/3/2001, 5:16 am. The flying object was observed at 5:16 am on September 3, 2001.  The direction of the flight was from West to East directions in the Connecticut/Massachusets state border. The object had distinctively observable 4 ligth beams (similar to high beams in the cars) alligned in rectangular format and a flashing white ligth in the center. But, it could be in a diamond format from my point of view.  The sound of the craft was very unusual for a plane or a helicopter. It almost sound it like a metal to metal rubbing with a very high pitch grinding/roaring sound. The time I observed was at 5:16 am with a clear night view in the background.  The 4 beams on the corners and the center flashing light were pointing downwards, making the area below the craft relatively brite.  The speed of the craft was steady, with a speed comparable to a slow flying helicopter.  The altidude of the craft may have been in the range of approx. 1/2 km to 1 km. The whole observation may have been in 5 to 10 seconds time frame while, the object was still visible through my window.  I am wondering if anyone else has reported anything similar in this time period.;42.0016;-72.4597
