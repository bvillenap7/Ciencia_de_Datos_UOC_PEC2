i made a report on the 16th and being a nigth person and smoker im out side alot  i find it odd i see this object a 2nd time 5 days lat;2006-06-21 13:34:00;stil lhappening;i made a report on the 16th and being a nigth person and smoker im out side alot  i find it odd i see this object a 2nd time 5 days later, stars and shit u would normally see continulousy (spelling?) i find this odd  also its out 2 hours earlier in a higher location in the sky  i tried calling my friend across town who witnessed it last time, but he was unavlible so i call my other friend 3 towns away in east windsor, who i told about the first time, and she did she it right where i said it would be, and as she saw she was in time to see it change colors again from a white to a crimson red, the other difference this time is it was shooting off what appeared to be like fire works, for the alttitude, location of the horizon and the fact it wasnt seen starting lower, but above the object, i can cancel out the odds it was a firework or a flare  the other issuse was there was a beam of light to the right of it at an angle, in which it was, if u did that old trick where u extened ur arm out stick out ur thumb, cover one eye, and notice u can ussally block the moon .... this beam from the object was long enugh to not be blocked, meaning it would appear to be longer then the moon when visible, my street light also flickered, a few times after beam was shot out, and my cell phone with full battery shut off and wont go back on, i currently have it in the charger  i've also notice that since the incedent, there has been an increase of small cargo jets headed to West over air force base, smaller then a 737, but shaped different, kinda like the ones the air force or navy use for radar, and shit   again if you have any info on this please contact ((e-address deleted))  i mean seriously i told my friends about it the first time, and i have 2 witnesses 1 for each account, DAMMIT I STOPPED GOING TO THE BAR OVER THIS;42.0016;-72.4597
