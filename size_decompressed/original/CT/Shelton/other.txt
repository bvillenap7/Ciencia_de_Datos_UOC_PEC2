Arrowhead shaped craft with anomalous-looking array of red-green strobes;2019-11-04 18:15:00;20 seconds;Arrowhead shaped craft with anomalous-looking array of red-green strobes Arrowhead shaped craft with unusual configuration of lights - POSSIBLY anomalous: Monday evening, approximately 6:15PM - full dark.  Thin clouds, about 1,000 ft altitude. Was driving SW on Route 8, right-hand lane, toward Stratford, between exits 12 and 11 in Shelton.  To my right (West), above tree line, about 45 degrees in night sky I noticed an approaching aircraft about a mile away (flying NE) that drew my attention because of its strangely pulsing array of lights (Yes, I frequently watch the skies.  Am no aviation pro, but familiar enough with most of the steady air traffic in my vicinity, anti-collision and navigation lights, etc.). This aircraft looked to be traveling at an altitude of about 300 feet going NE, parallel to Route 8, above Route 714 (Bridgeport Avenue), in the vicinity of the shopping area there (and Scinto-ville). Very bright multiple pairs of red and green lights that did not strobe alternately, port-middle-starboard or vice-versa, per second, like most aircraft, but pulsed red-green simultaneously and much faster all about the surface of what seemed to be an arrowhead shaped craft. No, NOT a helicopter - I know Sikorsky is nearby. If it made any noise I could not hear it because windows were rolled and I was in moving vehicle heading in opposite direction.  As we passed I slowed down somewhat, attempting to get a better look up through front window, but was unable to make out any fuselage or wings.  Size was difficult to determine, but seemed larger than most private planes but smaller than most commercial planes.  Therefore, I decided to get off at the next available exit, turn around and try to catch up to it.  Doing so only trapped me in routine after-work traffic back-up.;41.3054000000001;-73.1216999999999
Green meteorite came out of sky, de-flames itself if that’s a word, spacecraft hovering in air, disappears into thin air, warp drive ?;2020-10-01 23:00:00;2 seconds;Green meteorite came out of sky, de-flames itself if that’s a word, spacecraft hovering in air, disappears into thin air, warp drive ? I came to a stop sign with my friend after dropping another friend off at their house.  As we stopped at the stop sign at 11:00 pm we saw a green Meteorite over a field called “  Stowe field” in shelton ct, it came down from the sky, extremely bright, not even a second later this green meteorite basically de- flames itself if that’s even a word, and we both see this spacecraft just hovering, grey in color with green outlines, almost looked identical to a fighter jet from Star Wars, then me and my friend not even blinking an eye see this spacecraft disappear into thin air and it vanishes, I would say some kind of warp drive system as silly as it sounds.;41.3054000000001;-73.1216999999999
