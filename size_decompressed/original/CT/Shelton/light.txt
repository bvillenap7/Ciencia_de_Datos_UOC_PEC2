3 seperate light hovering 15 degrees above the horizon in Shelton,CT.;2009-08-14 23:00:00;hours;3 seperate light hovering 15 degrees above the horizon in Shelton,CT. In three different directions there were star like objects all flashing, red,gree,blue,white lights one at a time over and over again. All were about 15 degrees above the horizon. These lights did not move around, they hovered in the same position for over 2 hours till i went inside and stopped looking. they were still in the same position when i gave up looking. they were like positioned north,south,& east.  They were not planes. Planes were passing them. Not sure how far away they were. we have maximum visability tonight, they could be 100 miles away for all i know..but they were clear as day in the sky.;41.3054000000001;-73.1216999999999
Ball of flashing red/gree/white lights observed moving for 20-30 minutes;2019-09-24 19:00:00;30-40 minutes;Ball of flashing red/gree/white lights observed moving for 20-30 minutes My location: 41*17’60”N - 17*11’26”W, elevation 390 ASL.  Object was observed at 49* NE from this location at an elevation of about 20* above horizon.  No clouds, clear night with many bright stars. (*) means degrees. At about 10:00pm, I stepped out my back door.  With the naked eye, I observed what I thought was an aircraft practicing stalls at night.  Being a former glider pilot and life long aviation enthusiast, I am familiar with aircraft at night.  I also have a steady stream of aircraft overhead leaving JFK and heading across in the Atlantic flight corridor.  I could see red, green/blue and white lights and thought these to be the port/starboard/landing lights of an aircraft.  The lights were clustered together and blinking rapidly. Imagine those colored LEDs blinking quickly on a wreath but this was in the shape of a tight ball.  As I continued to watch the lights slowly swoop up and down through a space of 1.0 to 1.5 degrees of sky, (using fingers,) I realized that the lights were wrong for an aircraft.  I observed perhaps 8-12 swoops.  Each swoop was in a slightly different direction in the sky, some to the left, others to the right.  Each swoop was a duration of 4-5 one thousand from top! to bottom.  I had excellent reference for elevation changes as the event occurred between two stationary trees with horizontal branches.  After observing for perhaps 10 minutes or more, I went in and grabbed my binoculars (Bushnell 16x50) and returned outside. I moved my observation position 4 feet right to gain a clear, unobstructed view without branches but still between two trees on either side of the object.  Standing and observing hand held was shaky so I kneeled down behind an Adirondack chair to steady the image. I could now see much more clearly the small cluster of multiple colored lights. My focal setting was not set to infinity. Thinking the different colors could be a refraction of white light in the lenses, I moved and observed stars and they were distinctly a single, steady source of white light compared to the colored lights of the object. I thought to try and photograph the object with my smart phone but shooting stars at night with the phone is pointless.  As I continued to observe the object through the binoculars, the swooping had noticeably slowed and diminished. I also noticed the cluster seemed smaller than when I first started, as if it was moving away but still remained in the same altitude position relative to the trees.  As I had been observing the object for about 10-15 minutes, my knees were sore from kneeling on the stone pavers. I left the object, still visible with naked eye but smaller in the sky and went to bed wondering what the ‘ell I just saw….;41.3054000000001;-73.1216999999999
Three hovering orange lights that moved at incredible speed.;2019-12-23 18:25:00;5 minutes;Three hovering orange lights that moved at incredible speed. At 18:25 on Dec 23, 2019, I witnessed three unusually bright orange lights in the South to Southwest sky.  They were motionless for about 2 minutes.   I went into the house to get my son and when we returned there was only one.  It made no sound but suddenly started to move extremely quickly in an almost straight line until it was obscured by the clouds as it went above them and disappeared from sight.
