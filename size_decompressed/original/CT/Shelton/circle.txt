circle of light with beam of light shining towards the ground  ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));2009-09-19 19:57:00;1:30;circle of light with beam of light shining towards the ground I was cleaning out my car and I saw a reflection on the window.  I looked up the road and there was a ring of white light with a big beam of light shining down towards the ground.  I kept looking at it and my mother in law starting walking down the stairs to the 2nd floor screen porch and I yelled to her about the UFO.  By the time she was at the window, the light went upwards into the sky and went out of sight.  This is a very clear night, with absolutely zero clouds in the sky.  It was an amazing view that I will not forget. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));41.3054000000001;-73.1216999999999
Very bright round ball very high in the daytime sky and very bright.;2017-12-28 15:50:00;15 seconds;Very bright round ball very high in the daytime sky and very bright. I was pulling into the parking lot where I work.  The sun was just about to set far to my right passenger side window.  The sky was still very bright and I saw a round ball very bright silver and gold color high in the sky through my windshield.  I have seen many airplanes reflecting off the setting sun and this was nothing like that.  This was so extremely bright in the already bright clear blue sky I stopped my car to get a better look before I pulled into a parking spot and it suddenly took off with such speed it was just gone in a second.  I have never seen anything like this in my life.  Just amazing.  I checked my dash cam but the sky was still so bright it didn't pick up the object that high in the sky, but I certainly saw it with my eyes.  You can email me if you have any questions.;41.3054000000001;-73.1216999999999

No towers or streetlights in this area, that I have ever seen in day or night.  On this night, however, there was a flashing light, that almost seemed like a strobe light in the sky for about 2 minutes.  It wasn’t just a flashing light though, it was EXTREMELY BRIGHT, and lit up the normally blackened area.;41.3054000000001;-73.1216999999999
Circular object with lights underneath seen in images taken of cloud formation;2019-11-29 10:36:00;unknown;Circular object with lights underneath seen in images taken of cloud formation 11/29/2019:  Jones Tree Farm, Shelton, CT  While selecting our family Christmas tree, I noticed a nice cloud formation and an ice prism.  I took out my phone and snapped several pictures in succession.  The bright sun that day made it difficult to see the viewing glass of the phone and was basically shooting blind. A short while later I reviewed the images and saw something I was not expecting to- a disc shaped object, just left of the cloud formation.  In successive images the object appears in three different locations. I electronically zoomed -in with the phones camera to see the object better.  I immediately saw a dark circular object with what appears to be lights on the underside.  One image has four in a square pattern.  One has four in a diamond-shaped pattern. The third shows five lights.  These all together distinctly tell me this object was in motion. I have all the images and will be e-mailing the files.;41.3054000000001;-73.1216999999999
