White lights hovering above the tree line.  ((anonymous report));2019-08-19 00:05:00;15 minutes;White lights hovering above the tree line. Around midnight, I came out to my front porch.  In between the trees I noticed two bright white lights with a band of five to eight smaller lights under it.  The lights hovered above the tree lines without a sound and it was illuminating the dark road (there are no street lamps on the road).  It seemed to be getting closer to ground very slowly.  Then the motion light detectors went on at my house as well as the neighbor's.  At this point, I went inside.;41.3054000000001;-73.1216999999999
