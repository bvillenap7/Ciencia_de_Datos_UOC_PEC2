I immediately got my phone out and took a picture. Only when I zoomed in I can see this light make like zigzags in the sky. It then looked like it changed color.  My 16 yr old son came home around 1030pm and we started taking videos. We then found like 4 or 5 more all throughout the sky.they looked like flashing lights in the night sky.  We then took pics and videos because now they were turning into what looked like spheres and all different shapes.  One of the pictures we took actually shows the bottom of the object and it clearly shows a circle bottom and then it like disappears and shoots off the screen. I also took a video of all 3 in 1 video to show it wasn't just a fluke happening. It was actually something in the sky.;41.3054000000001;-73.1216999999999
