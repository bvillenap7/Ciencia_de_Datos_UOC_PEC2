Light moon shine glow woods Old Farms swamp.;2005-06-15 00:00:00;5 minutes;Light moon shine glow woods Old Farms swamp. These dates may not be approximate. I believe on the evening of June 15 2005 around midnight I awoke from sleeping to the view of bright “ moon shine” coming from the woods into the basement window. I may have checked the sliding door to make sure it was locked, I may have been sleepwalking. I may have hit myself to make sure I was awake. I can’t say that I went into the woods behind our house to investigate, though I remember complaining about two small “bug-bites” on my stomachs side (I think this is were it was) to my sister.  Beyond this I can not determine events real or imagination. The entire event was very hazy and surreal, though I believe I checked to make sure I was really awake and not in a vivid dream.  I do remember a dream I had previously of a space ship in the woods around the time of November 10 1997, date not approximate. This spaceship was in the mountain passages in the Old Farms area.  This I was sure was a dream though. This moon like glow occurred near the Old Farms swamp area.  I do not know if these two subjects are related at all beyond the same area where I experienced them.  I think the spaceship dream was related to science fiction media. It was a very white light that seemed to be glowing from the woods towards the house, and nothing more that I can determine.  These events all occurred near Old Farms swamp in Simsbury CT. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));41.8754444444445;-72.8021388888889
