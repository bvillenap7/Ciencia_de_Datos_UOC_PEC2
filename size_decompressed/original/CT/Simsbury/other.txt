A white, beluga whale shaped object about a third the size of a small plane flew from hor. to hor. in 3 min. ((NUFORC:  Contrail?));2004-09-21 18:15:00;About 3 mintutes;A white, beluga whale shaped object about a third the size of a small plane flew from horizon to horizon in 3 mintutes. It was a beluga-whale shaped, white, ship that flew from northeast to southwest over Softball Field 6 at Memorial Field in Simsbury. There was woods around the field, and behind the woods was a school. It was a clear day with no clouds and flew from horizon to horizon in about 3 mintutes. It flew faster than a cloud but slower than a plane. There was a small breeze, but not enough to propel it. It was about a third the size of a small, three-person plane. (not commercial)It made no noise whatsoever and that was how you could tell it wasn't a plane. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witnesses elect to remain semi-anonymous.

((HOAX??))  Fire.  Simsbury.  Radiation.  UFO?  No animals, no plants.;2007-11-05 15:00:00;?;Fire.  Simsbury.  Radiation.  UFO?  No animals, no plants. Fire put out on mountain near Northgate Road, Simsbury, by fire department. Do not believe it was lightning, and I know no one would go up there. I am surprised they were even able to locate it, let alone detect this fire due to its location.  It is a long hike to the spot where this occurred. Possible UFO with gamma radiation - no animals or vegetation in the immediate area and surroundings. ((NUFORC Note:  One of two similar reports, with different dates, from the same source.
