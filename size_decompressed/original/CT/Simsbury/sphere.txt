((HOAX??))  UFO engineering blueprint scam Internet.;2006-09-06 00:00:00;1 minute;UFO Engineering Blueprint Scam Internet This is very basic, probably a hoax. While google searching for ufo reports, I randomly intercepted a document which appeared to be a classified diagram of a space ship layout.  I will not reveal what agency stamped this.  I viewed the page for about a minute.  It was an engineering blueprint. I tried to reload the page to see if it was false, and I could not get the page to reappear.  It was if it had vanished.  It was so out of the blue I could not believe what I had witnessed.  This was roughly around September 06, 2006.  Though this is an estimate, it was a while ago.  I still have not forgotten this event. In all truth it may have been a scam.  It has not happened since. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
