I turned over in bed and looked up into the night sky, to see a small white orb shoot across my window.   It seemed so close, I first thought it was a falling star, but it was so close and traveled horizontally.   Then it reappeared in the opposite direction and literally danced back and forth between my house and my neighbor's.   I got up and watched it close to an hour.
