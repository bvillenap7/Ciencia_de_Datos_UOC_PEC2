Thought it was a car, but happened to look up and saw the bright blue light with a bright yellow tail above the tree lines.  Was followed with what sounded like a loud, muffled boom.  I felt a weird chill come over me.   Not easily scared, but threw cigarette and jumped back into house.  Would like to know what this was, just so I don't seem like I'm losing it.;41.4344;-73.0609
