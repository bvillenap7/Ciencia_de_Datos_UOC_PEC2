Ten to twelve orange circles flying in formation southerly over Chester, Connecticut.;2012-09-15 21:00:00;5 to 10 minutes;Ten to twelve orange circles flying in formation southerly over Chester, Connecticut. We were in our boat in a cove in Chester last night (9/15/12) looking up at the sky (which was very clear).  We noticed a few airplanes (blinking lights and /or sound).  Then we saw a line of orange lights, non-blinking (relative size as a bright planet from river surface)starting to move in the sky from the north to the south roughly parallel to the river.  They seemed to be flying in group formations:  one or two of them were in a tight formation perpendicular to each other, and the others in a line of sorts.   Clearly they were navigating and moving together.  As each one got to a certain point in the sky it seemed to just disappear (can't say that they just took off into the sky or not). We listened carefully for sound but there was none. In total there were probably about a dozen that crossed the sky over about 5-10 minutes.  They were round, bright, orange, very distinct, and very coordinated in their movements. We are educated, normal, and sane people an! d were affected by this enough to report it here.;41.4044;-72.4674
