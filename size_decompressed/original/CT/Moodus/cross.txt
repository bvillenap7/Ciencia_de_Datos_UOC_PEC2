Emitted no sounds as it flew by fairly close. Was giving my horse water & admiring sunrise as an object came into my view fairly close - right above the tops of the ash trees in our yard. Thought it was a drone at first but the shape was so odd & there was absolutely no sound. It flew fairly fast at an even pace and I couldn’t stop staring at it until it disappeared. Looked like a metal cross flying vertically and had a dark red, somewhat glowing “spoon shaped” top. The strangest thing I’ve ever seen...googled all types of drones and weather tools but nothing compares.;41.5086;-72.4459
