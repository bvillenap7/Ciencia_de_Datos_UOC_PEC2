It was odd in shape and bright in the sky and seemed to be moving but stationary. At 22:08 I began filming.  The video captured the shape changing, the seemingly moving, square to oval, circle - bright white/yellow in color. Looked to be spinning at some point looked to be burning. I can provide video and pictures. It would be there , disappear , show back up same location .  Then all the sudden about 15 minutes later it disappeared and did not reappear.  It seemed to be quite high - I thought it could be a star or satellite at first trying to find an explanation.  I saw it and my three children observed it.  They are 14& 12 (twins);41.5086;-72.4459
