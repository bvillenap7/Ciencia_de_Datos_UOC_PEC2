At approximately 12:35 am on Oct. 31, 2017, I was outside in my yard.  A bright light caught my attention.  It was fairly low on the horizon, and also was a bit slower than any shooting star Iâ€™ve ever seen, and much bigger, and brighter.  Still the whole event lasted only seconds.  It moved quickly and seemed to recede below horizon.   Probably a shooting star, but it was pretty weird. I am just an ordinary person, with virtually no astronomy knowledge.  I just felt compelled to report this as it freaked me out a little.;41.5086;-72.4459
