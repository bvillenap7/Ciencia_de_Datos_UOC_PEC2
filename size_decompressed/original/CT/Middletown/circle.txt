Large orange ball moving slowly and stopping in the sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Venus?  PD));2010-08-20 19:00:00;30-45 minute;Large orange ball moving slowly and stopping in the sky Outside with my friend saying goodbye I notice a large bright circle on the sky.  I thought it was a planet, my friend said maybe venus, so i went inside the house to get my camera and told my dad you can see a planet and to come check it out.   I started snapping a few pictures when my friend says, is it moving?  I focused back at the light and off my camera and noticed in fact it was!  Slowly moving downward towards the horizen line then stopped again.   I changed my camera to video mode and started recording.  It then started moving left along the tree line in the distance prolly about 20 miles away or so.   We then proceeded to follow it up the street walking 100-200 feet away from the house.  It would stop and move constanly.   It flickered several different colors at one point from blue to green to orange and red.  It was definately not a plane with blicking lights this was way too big.  It eventually went below the tree line so we got into my dads truck and went to a higher point few streets over and I started recording it again.  It made no sound.   We watched as it sat still for about 5 minutes then it proceeded to go below the horizen line again.   The 3 of us stood there in awe of what we just saw, all agreeing it was not a plane or helicopter.;41.5556999999999;-72.6629216981132
Two orange circle lights flying  side-by-side one went straight up and the other went off into the distance and both disappeared.;2011-07-04 22:00:00;5-7 minutes;Two orange circle lights flying  side-by-side one went straight up and the other went off into the distance and both disappeared. Flying from southwest to northeast over Middletown, CT, roughly 100 yards apart side-by-side for approximately 70 miles or so.   One went straight up into the sky and disappeared 40,000-50,000 feet up and the other stayed on a straighter course and disappeared into the distance.   They were both orange lighted circles roughly 1/10 of the size of a full moon.   At first they appeared to be either helicopters or planes but there were other planes around which did not look the same as these circles.;41.5556999999999;-72.6629216981132
Bright big circular light with an aura like light next to the full moon and bellow a tiny little light getting closer to it or in it.;2014-10-09 20:18:00;7 minutes;bright big circular light with an aura like light next to the full moon and bellow a tiny little light getting closer to it or in it. Sitting Report:  I work as a housekeeper at the Middletown court house in CT.  As I come close to finish my shift I walked into the jury room to clean as schedule.  The room is in the sixth floor the last floor in the building and it has the biggest windows and it faces the CT River with an amazing view.  I’m usually contemplating the view out these windows whether is night or day.  Well as I enter the room I right away see the full moon Big and bright, shade in the water and a planet or big bright star next to it (so I thought) just stunning and beautiful.  I wanted to take a picture but for some reason I thought to get my co-worker because she has a bigger and updated phone and it could take got pictures.    Well before I decide to go get her I was staring at both the moon and what I thought it was a big bright planet or star beside it.  I started to notice a small light getting closer and closer to it and maybe even going in it.   So I right away ran to get my co-worker exited and at the same time a! little weird out about it that I forgot to take a shot with my phone just in case.  Eight minutes went by and I couldn’t find my co-worker anywhere so I returned to the sixth floor to the same window view and I couldn’t believe it……it wasn’t there anymore!!!!!    So I regret not taking a picture I was so mad.  But I took a picture of the view anyways.  I should of took that shot it was as bright as a planet or star next to the full moon.  I wonder if anybody else reported seeing something similar tonight as well.   Well that’s my story I am excited I had two ufo sittings back home in Puerto Rico when I was twelve years of age and experienced a bright light in my home that lasted about an hour and then went away.  I believe, by experience not because.;41.5556999999999;-72.6629216981132

It just sat over a military facility in Middletown CT on Smith Street and took off when a helicopter approached.  The helicopter appeared to be in silent mode and circled the area for up to 30 minutes.
