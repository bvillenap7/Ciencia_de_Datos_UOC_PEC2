Visible beyond normal sattelite viewing at sunset, Only explanation I have is the space shuttle, is it up now? Coming from the north I can make out a high traveling object usually there sattelites, But this object quite a few stops on its north to south trail, there was no atmospheric turbulance or cloud coverage, when the object reached just about to the zenith, it made a dramatic turn toward the east, I was able to watch the object travel east, then again turn to the south, the sun was down enough that it should not have been a reflection, regardless I have witnessed many Sattelites, and a few unexplaind ones and this is one of them. the object seemed to twinkle a bluish to orange color.;41.5556999999999;-72.6629216981132
Lit object hovering in sky over CT river.......Then planes began circling it in the area........it remained then moved upwards.;2014-05-16 22:00:00;2 hours;Lit object hovering in sky over CT river.......Then planes began circling it in the area........it remained then moved upwards Viewed Glowing object in southeasterly direction from Southern Middletown area placing the object over the CT river near Haddam.   It glowed and hovered and did not remain stationary as it moved behind trees and then appeared again while I remained on my back porch in the same position.   After sighting this I noticed planes began flying towards the object.  Not typical planes or commercial aircraft.  These were different.  I could tell by the sound and light colors of the aircraft which were different than most commercial airliners.   The object remained for over two hours then began moving upward in the sky until it was gone.   It reappeared once again 2 weeks later.;41.5556999999999;-72.6629216981132

Two strange lights chase each other across the sky;2017-06-10 20:45:00;2 minutes;Two strange lights chase each other across the sky I have a great view of lamentation mountain from my back patio and am a regular star gazer with or without telescope multiple nights a week. I was sitting out on patio on Saturday the tenth, watching the stars, and noticed a strange thing. My house is directly on the flight path to Bradley airport, so I know the regular tracks of planes. In addition, the sky is dark and clear enough to see the space station overhead on most nights as it passes. I noticed what at first took for a satellite passing overhead as it had that pinprick of light effect. White/blue and very dim.  Then I noticed another light behind it following it.  Very similar in size and color but it did not move in a straight line. This object weaved back and forth in a fluid like manner while following the first object across the night sky almost like a dance. This occurred as it went south west to north east over head lasting about a minute before I lost both objects behind some thin clouds. It definitely was not a plane as the objects were very fast and the second object weaved about in ways a plane couldn't, totally silent. Definitely fascinated me even though every hair on my body stood up as I watched it happen.;41.5556999999999;-72.6629216981132
Numerous high altitude fast moving lights in formation.;2018-12-22 22:00:00;15-20 minutes;Numerous high altitude fast moving lights in formation. On 22 December 2018 at approximately 2200hrs, I was taking my dog out for the final time of the night. The moon was extremely bright and clouds were patchy. As I looked up at the moon, I noticed a large number of solid lights traveling from a southeastern to northwestern direction.  All lights were equidistant and in the same formation. I couldn't guess the altitude...much higher than commercial flights.  There were several normal aircraft in the area. I watched about 25-30 of these lights fly over, I tried to record them with my phone, but thanks to the bright moon, didn't get anything. I went inside and told my wife to come outside and look.  She was baffled, especially at the speed they were traveling.  Much to fast to be a commercial flight, and too many on the same flight path. I tried looking on the airplane tracker sites to see what was in the air at the time, and nothing out of the norm.  Definitely not what we witnessed.;41.5556999999999;-72.6629216981132
