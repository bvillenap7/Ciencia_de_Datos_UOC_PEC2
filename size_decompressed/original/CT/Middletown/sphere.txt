While showing a hawk circling the skies above my house to my son, I noticed something I had never seen before.  It looked like a bubble, mostly see-through or translucent, with a single white/blue light source in it's center.  It was moving at a high rate of speed in a very straight line.  It was compltely noiseless. It was lower, much smaller, and much faster than the aircraft that fly over daily for Bradley Airport. It was hard to track as it camoflouged itself so well, but it did not turn which helped me keep it in my sight for about 30 seconds.  Within 5 minutes there was a single military jet flying low in the same vicinity, another thing I have never seen in this area.

Emerald Green Orb viewed on the  4th of July in Middletown, CT.;2017-07-02 22:00:00;20 minutes;Emerald Green Orb viewed on the  4th of July in Middletown, CT. My sister and I were watching the Middletown fireworks from the backyard last night, facing west towards the Connecticut River.  It was a beautiful clear evening.  We didn’t have a clear view of the fireworks they were visible through the trees only.   Off to the left of the display in the back field (facing west) I noticed an emerald green object in the sky that looked like an orb, the size of a grapefruit that I pointed out to my sister.  The orb was stationary above the tree line for a good 3-5 minutes, in which time we had a discussion.  Was it a plane watching for fires?  We reasoned a plane couldn’t stay in one location for so long.  We changed our logic and thought perhaps a helicopter.  It seemed to still and small to be a helicopter, there was no sound that we could detect.  We then reasoned it was a droid.  We have no knowledge of droids or their behavior.   Then the orb started moving in our direction, it gave off no sound, changed its color form em! erald green to red, moved behind a tree about 20 yards from us, changed color back to green and floated off in a southern direction beyond our view.  That was weird, we decided, what was that?   Within 5 minutes, it came back again, hovering above the tree line where it first appeared, to the left of the fireworks display.  I went into the house and got my phone and binoculars. As I viewed the orb through the binoculars, it looked like three green arrows, pointed in the same direction, with a small circular shape at the front (>>>).  Again it drifted closer in our direction, went behind that same big oak  tree and skirted off in the same southern direction.  I’m the worst photographer on the planet but did get two pics with my cell phone, my sister got one pic.  Is this thing a Droid or what????;41.5556999999999;-72.6629216981132
