We stopped the car because I asked them if they were seeing what I was seeing. They said yes and pulled over. It was a long cylindrical silver shaped object that was stationary in the sky unmoving.  The object then changed  from silver to gold and changed shape from cylindrical to round but looked like it had a pole in the center.
