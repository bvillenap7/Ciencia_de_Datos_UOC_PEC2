A light with a slight glow.;2010-07-16 21:30:00;1 min;A light with a slight glow. We noticed the craft hovering on the west side of Middletown .  The craft was not stil but it was moving fast.   As we contiued to stare at the object it did almost like a little dip and then started moving away until it faded and was completely gone.  The closes thing I can liken this sighting to is china UFO on 7-8-10 it was the same white light but without the huge tail or smoke that the Chinese UFO displayed.   What we saw was just the light with just a little glow. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));41.5556999999999;-72.6629216981132
Witness noticed a bright light that first appeared to be a plane descending.  ((MUFON report));2018-11-04 22:25:00;Minutes;Witness noticed a bright light that first appeared to be a plane descending over the Middlefield hills while looking out the front window atop a Durham ct hill.  Witness was located south of it, facing north.  It moved slowly in a downward 45-deg direction towards the west, paused, and descended again slowly straight down. It paused again, then spun as if it was a centrifuge.  Lights dimmed and disappeared.  Guess at location would be, near Wadsworth State Park or further north.  It was unusually bright.
