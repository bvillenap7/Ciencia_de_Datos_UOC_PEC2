I saw two lights in the sky that I first thought were stars and then as we drove closer I saw that the lights were part of an object.  The object didn't seem to be moving.  It seemed to hovering over this one spot.   Then as soon as we got to the place it was hovering over it started to move.  It just so happened to be moving the same direction that were headed and were able to get a better look at it.  It looked like it had a diamond shape to it and it had 4 lights.   It was lower to the ground than a plane would be which is another reason why it caught my friend's and my attention.   Once we reached our destination and we were able to really look at it, it just took off and within seconds it was nowhere to be seen!;41.5556999999999;-72.6629216981132
