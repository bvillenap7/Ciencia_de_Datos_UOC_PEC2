Small UFO over garden, daylight, 120 feet away, 19 second vid, Cheshire, CT, Oct 2012;2012-10-26 10:01:00;~19 seconds;Small UFO over garden, daylight, 120 feet away, 19 second vid, Cheshire, CT, Oct 2012 Hi, I'm a homeowner in CT.  I posted this vid on youtube tonight, I'll describe it here (not monetizing it at youtube, nor anywhere, I am an enthusiast of ufology, I've heard of you, I respect you.  And I am not drunk.  Yay!)  I just looked up the properties of the short vid, that's the time and date it gave me.  I thought it was November, apparently, twas October 2012.   I walked out my back door, I have a large yard with a woods edge at the rear, deer come each day, I think I was testing the zoom and focus.  Canon powershot 12 mega pix, not an expensive cam, the original on this computer is more striking that what appears in the youtube upload, don't know why.   Walked out the door, saw nothing, focused on rear clearing, stopped film.  When uploaded, saw this thing.  Looks like 2 birds mating, or 2 bees doing something.  But it is about 2 or 3 feet wide, gray top, lighter rear half, strange motion.   I had opened a glass screen door, thought maybe it was a refraction.  Have glass windows on the left as I walk out, but I don't see a connection to my movement and the movement of this thing.   I tell ya, when I re-looked at it the other day on this machine, I said, Oh My God.   My Hungarian GF was here, I showed it without comment twice.  She works in the garden over which it was, and she asked me, Do they live here?   Very strange, a bit disturbing.  Best wishes:   http://youtu.be/ClvdP0ERi8U;41.5041000000001;-72.9167000000001
