It zig zagged across the sky then  zipped above the clouds diagonally to my left. It was a bit off in the distance and low in the sky before it shot off. The object seemed to be moving extremely fast and I only saw it for a few seconds. It was much larger than a star- a little bigger than a softball. The object looked a bit like a giant meteor but itâ€™s movement of going up and down then shooting off upward to the left was perplexing. There was no sound. There was scattered cloud cover, but no rain or thunder.;41.5041000000001;-72.9167000000001
