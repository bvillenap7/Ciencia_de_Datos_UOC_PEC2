Grey cigar shaped object over Cheshire, CT, around midnight.;2010-07-22 00:30:00;1 min;Grey cigar shaped object over Cheshire, CT, around midnight. I am writing this report about 5 minutes after the sighting.   I stepped outside onto my back porch at roughly 12:30am.  The sky was perfectly crystal clear and their was a 3/4 moon.   The object I saw was first thought to be a cloud.  But I thought it was very strange becaue it was so tiny compared to any other cloud I had seen.  The object was far in the distance.  I would estimate at roughly 5 or 6 miles away.   Regardless of me thinking it was strange, I still just thought it was a cloud especially considering it was greyish in color.  It stood absolutely still in the sky.   I had the moon that was about a fist's length away as a good landmark for reference.   I quickly went into my house for maybe 20 seconds to grab my binoculars which were right by the door.  I turn around and look out and the object is gone.  This is what made me decide it was not a cloud.  This fact combined with that it was not moving.   I figured a cloud doesnt just disappear in less than 20 seconds and it definitely wouldnt have moved out of sight in that time considering it didnt appear to be moving in the first place.   I was a bit spooked at this sighting and still sort of am but I am excited nonetheless.;41.5041000000001;-72.9167000000001
