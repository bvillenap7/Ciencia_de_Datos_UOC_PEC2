The difference was that this “star” was moving and continued to do so for over 30 minutes during which time I observed several aircraft that were easily distinguishable as such and appeared to be much closer to the earth than the “UFO”. The movement of the object was very much like an insect on a wall.  It trailed around the sky, sometimes making loops it had no apparent direction and it stayed in the same general area of the sky.  The movements were slow but also jerky or even twitchy as if it were repeatedly speeding up and slowing down.  The color maintained a constant white light and the shape and size remained consistent it emitted no sound. The sighting was observed around 1am at beach in southeastern Connecticut there was a clear sky and not much distraction. It perhaps stayed for longer than the 30 or more minutes that I observed it.  However, I left the area.;41.3649;-71.9069
