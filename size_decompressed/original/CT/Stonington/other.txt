Bright sparkle in the north eastern sky that hovered and went below the treeline into the horizon;2008-01-24 03:08:00;2 minutes;Bright sparkle in the north eastern sky that hovered and went below the treeline into the horizon I awoke about 3 a.m., January 24, 2008. Lying down I was staring out the window.  The window faces north at about 1:00 in the eastern sky I saw a bright twinkling light.  It reminded me of a distant fire fly.  I assumed it was a plane, but it did not move to the east, or west, nor did it come toward my home.  From this distance it appeared stationary.  I realized it was probably not a plane because there was no flashing light, nor did I see green or red light as you usually do when you see a plane pass by.  As I watched, it slowly disappeared below the tree line in the north eastern sky.  I didnâ€™t think it could be a plane then, because the direction was going away from me.  I assume then, that I was not looking at tail lights at that brightness and sparkle.  The background was a tree lined hill and pastures.  There are no suburban neighborhoods in that direction.;41.3649;-71.9069
