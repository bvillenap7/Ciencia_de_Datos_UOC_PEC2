Star became extremely bright, then dim again. Then moved off to the South.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible Iridium satellite flare.  PD));2004-05-31 03:00:00;45 seconds;Star became extremely bright, then dim again. Then moved off to the South. Sitting in a lawn chair fishing from the town pier, facing east. What appeared to be a star all of the sudden became extremely bright and much, much bigger. This stationary brightness continued for several seconds and then it went back to star size again. At that time it began move off to the south.  It did not blink like a plane would. It traveled at the approximate speed that a jet would, although it seemed maybe a little faster. It disappeared high in the sky through the haze. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Possible Iridium satellite flare.  PD));41.2775999999999;-72.8114999999999
Fast moving bright light observed over Branford Ct 12/7/2005;2005-12-08 18:30:00;3-5 seconds;Fast moving bright light observed over Branford Ct 12/7/2005 I was looking up in the sky around 6:30 pm on December 7th 2005 in Branford Ct.  I saw a bright light cross the sky. It was not consistant with any shooting star I have ever seen. It seemed much closer, near where planes would normally fly.  The shape was round and the size was much wider than traditional aircraft.  What struck me as odd was the speed it traveled and the fact that it made no sound.  It lasted for what I could see was about 2-3 seconds than went out of sight.  I have seen a meteor burn in earths atmosphere which gives off a green glow.  This was pure white light.  It was near the Branford airport, however the planes that I saw in the distance before and especially after the event seemed to be moving in slow motion in comparison.;41.2775999999999;-72.8114999999999
Series of flashing colorful lights and then took off and vanished within a second.;2013-01-19 21:00:00;10 seconds;Series of flashing colorful lights and then took off and vanished within a second. When I first saw it, it was 3 extremely bright white lights.  It suddenly started flashing all different colors, green, white, blue, and purple.  Then another set of lights the same color appeared.   We were unsure if it was all one aircraft or 2. In the blink of an eye it disappeared from sight. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

White orb over Branford, CT and moving in sky between stars, not behaving like airplane nor shooting star.;2013-05-07 22:45:00;3 minutes;White orb over Branford, CT and moving in sky between stars, not behaving like airplane nor shooting star. We were stargazing with an iphone app when we noticed a circular ball of light, a light orb, that we assumed to be s planet moving somewhat quickly but quite far away. We couldnt capture video nor photo as it wouldnt show.  We watched it fly southeasterly in a linear and sometimes zigzag pattern.  We live in a flight pattern area but it didn't fit the examples by direction, AND had only a white light, looking like the glow of a distant planet or a star orb rather than blinking airplane lights we are used to.  The movement was also zig zagged at times.  It appeared to move between stars, north easterly then dropping southeasterly before disappearing suddenly.  We watched, my daughter and I,in my backyard which faces a saltmarsh.  We had been meditating then dabbling with playing CSETI tones when we witnessed this.;41.2775999999999;-72.8114999999999
Sparkling ball of light, zoomed away at a speed I have never witnessed before.;2020-07-14 20:54:00;2 minutes;Sparkling ball of light, zoomed away at a speed I have never witnessed before. This is my second encounter with this ball of flashing light. The light was stationary in the air and was sparkling much brighter than a star for around a minute and a half, and then immediately shot up just a bit, and zoomed away into the clouds far away behind it. I do have video.;41.2775999999999;-72.8114999999999
