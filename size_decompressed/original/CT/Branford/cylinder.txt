Incrediably fast object hovering then accelerating to tremendous speed, and then disappearing.;2008-04-16 14:30:00;30-60 sec.;Incrediably fast object hovering then accelerating to tremendous speed, and then disappearing. I was in the left back-driver side of the car looking to the north of Connecticut,driving north on the highway from East to Branford.  The sky was clear blue without a cloud in sight.  Noticing what I thought to be a commercial airliner I focused my sight to see what type of plane it was.  As I steadied my gaze I realized the object wasn't moving but rather hovering, and as I looked closed there seemed to be not distinctive edges to the craft.  I alerted my fellow passengers in the car in the car just so I didn't think my eyes were playing tricks on me.  As I looked closer the color of the craft appeared to be a white to faded chrome like color.  The strangest part of the whole sighting though was that, as the other passengers int the car started to take more of a notice to the ship, it began to move very fast in a parallel direction with us.  It was an unexplainable speed which I have never seen before in any man made vehicle.  Then without inclining or declining it just disappeared.  I'm still dumbfounded as to what it could of been, I am much more intrigued into what it could of been....if anyone can help me with this post a response to it somehow on this site.

Long silver colored cylindrical shaped craft seen over Branford, CT;2013-03-14 17:40:00;1:50;Long silver colored cylindrical shaped craft seen over Branford, CT The time of my sighting was approximately 17:40 hours EST on 3/14/2013 in Branford CT.  I was standing at my front door which faces east towards the Thimble Islands.  By chance I was looking out from the doorway when I spotted a long silver colored cylindrical shaped craft which was traveling south to north.  At first it was in the open air and then entered into a cloud bank. I ran in the house and grabbed my video camera and went back outside to get a better look. I focused on the craft which by now had emerged from the clouds.  What I witnessed was a long cylindrical craft with no markings, wings or a tail fin. I ran back into the house agin calling to Barbie Heid to come outside to see it.  It was at this point that the craft changed its direction to a westerly heading. I tried to film it through the trees but the trees blocked my viewing partially.  I was fortunate enough to catch a few seconds of video footage of the craft which I would be glad to send you.  I have to say with all honesty that the length of the craft was approximately the width of the sun from my viewing point in respect to its height, which was at cloud level.;41.2775999999999;-72.8114999999999
From W sky a bright white light was observed meandering and hovering at a very low altitude over the water as it approached.;2019-08-02 22:20:00;10 minutes;From western sky a bright white light was observed meandering and hovering at a very low altitude over the water as it approached and flew over the shoreline.  When viewed overhead, it appeared to be shaped like a cylinder with wings attached.  One wing was tipped with a red light, while the  other side had a green light.  The craft was humming audibly and proceeded to fly easterly towards North Branford, disappearing over the tree line. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.
