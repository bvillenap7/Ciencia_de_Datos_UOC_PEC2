I was driving on I-95 North  in Connecticut near Branford.  Off in the distance at the height of about a helicopter i saw a hovering cigar shaped object.  As i drove closer it stayed in the same location, I was driving at about 65 miles per hour.   This object looks similar to one i have seen in the past in Rhode Island.  Today on the local news there was a story on possible strange formations on a city green in New Haven which is close by to Branford.
