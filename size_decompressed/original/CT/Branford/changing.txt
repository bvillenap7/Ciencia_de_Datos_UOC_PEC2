I was standing outside with my wife and daughter, when a pulsating orb traveled across the sky.  Daughter said a “lantern” but was moving too fast for that – and it seemed to change shape later on. Luckily, I have almost the whole event recorded on security camera.  Absolutely not an airplane.  It was mostly round in the beginning and pulsating orange.  Towards the end, it looked more triangular or like an orb with tails.  It appeared to be below cloud cover so speed and distance can be estimated a bit better.;41.2775999999999;-72.8114999999999
