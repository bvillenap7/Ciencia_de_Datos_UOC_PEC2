Colorful section off egg-shaped craft 14 ft.;1984-04-15 00:00:00;6-7 minutes;Colorful Section off Egg shaped craft 14 ft. Myself and 3 friends were in what was called the pit back then, right next to the town dump in Branford Ct.. A The approximate date, 1984, spring time.  We were all in our mid teens 15-16 just driving ages.  One of us had a bit of pot that was very fresh leaves from his plant he grew and couldn't wait for the plant to mature or for the stuff to dry, but we tried lighting it to no avail.  I remember because the subject of drugs came up when I reported this to police.  So we were not high on drugs, but trying!  We were parked facing the dump in the Pit right in the middle of probably 20 acres of dug out land used for fill around town.  So to get in this private property the entrance is a gravel 30 degree shear drop on both sides about 12 feet down into the pit. Not bad enough to kill us but damage or flip if over we went.  Sitting parked trying to light wet weed Frank in the passenger seat yells look at that! WTF are those things zigzagging over the dump!?  These objects  were shooting lasers at each other and moving around just missing each other by what looked like inches.  Then in a second one was over the car on the passenger side more so I could see it as plain as day it was only 30 ft. up.  It was Egg shaped with sections of colors that were pulsating dim to bright and changing colors from one section to the next.  It was so beautiful I still get a tear in my eyes thinking about how unearthly it was.  I knew it wasn't from this planet.  But the other 3 guys weren't going to stick around to watch what could happen next.  So we started driving out of there.  As we were peeling out Gary in the back said they're all coming together in a ball.  So the other Gary driving the car turned the car around and shot it off, at the gravel entrance facing the bottom of the pit on the 30 degree, as the 4 ufos came together as one incredibly bright light a beam hit the car, the car was going crazy with noise and the lights were flickering on off then the car started moving without it running up the gravel in reverse grinding gears and lights on off radio stations changing all at once crazy!  It was terrifying and then it was over. It was gone that fast.   We were on the road driving is my next memory.  I recall the entire event. I went to the Branford PD the next morning and reported it.  I don't blame the officer for not taking me serious.  Can't say I would have.  Anyway he did say that calls came in about bright lights over the dump.  So that's my story and I'm sticking to it.;41.2775999999999;-72.8114999999999
shiny object in the sky;2001-01-26 07:45:00;2-3 minutes;shiny object in the sky I was driving home and noticed a very shiny, reflective, round object in the sky...it caught my attention so I made sure to keep my eyes on it since it didn't appear to be a plane. It seemed to stay in one place, hovering, then it began a rapid decent at an angle. Once it reached the midpoint of the horizon, it disappeared. I thought about calling the news papers in case there was a crash somewhere, but I'm not sure if it would do any good. **i can be contacted if necessary via email only;41.2775999999999;-72.8114999999999
