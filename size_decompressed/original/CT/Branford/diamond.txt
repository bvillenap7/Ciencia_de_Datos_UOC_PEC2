My friend and I were driving on Route 1, right across the Guilford/Branford border into Branford.  Straight ahead, to our left, we witnessed two diamond shaped red lights just above the tree line.  It was nearing sundown, but still well-lit daytime.  We found the nearest parking lot - the Hilltop Orchards on Rt. 1 - and watched events from our car. >From the parking lot, we were facing south.  The lights were directly ahead of us.  They were two objects, both identical, a good distance apart.  Each object had two distinct red triangular lights, and no noticable frame or body. The two lights on each craft alternated luminescence.  The object looked a little like this: <>, with each of the carats being a red light. The objects moved toward each other VERY slowly, blinking out of synch with each other.  After about seven minutes or so, the two objects met each other, and actually appeared to COMBINE, forming an object closer to a disc (of the same size) with four rotating red lights: <||>.  At this point, the object moved much faster, and dissappeared to the right of our view.  We got into our car and drove to the exit 56 onramp of I-95 in the hopes of catching up with it, but had no luck.  The craft dissappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
