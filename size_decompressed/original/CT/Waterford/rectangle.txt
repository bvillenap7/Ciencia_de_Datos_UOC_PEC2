Red ball of light traveling west and gaining altitude until lost in clouds.;2014-08-03 21:20:00;3 minutes;Red ball of light traveling west and gaining altitude until lost in clouds. Heading south on route 1 in Waterford, CT, at approximately 21:20, my spouse and I happened to notice an orange object in the sky heading west and gaining altitude.  The object was somewhat square and solid orange, as if it were a ball of light or the bottom of a rocket burning fuel through the atmosphere.   The object was several thousand feet up when spotted. I pulled over and got out of our vehicle while I handed my wife my iPhone to record the object.  There was no sound that we could hear being omitted from the object and we watched for almost 3 minutes before it disappeared into the clouds.  I must add that I specifically looked for flashing lights off of potential wings, but there weren't any.  Tonight is a relatively clear night and I can identify airplanes in the sky as I type this report.;41.3458;-72.1473
