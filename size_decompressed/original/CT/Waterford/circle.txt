A Summer Date in July 1979 Near Millstome Power Plant;1975-04-01 23:00:00;40 minutes;A Summer Date in July 1979 Near Millstome Power Plant One evening during the summer of July 79 while on a date with my future husband we were driving the beach road in our home town.  I noticed a round light over the Millstone Nuclear Power Plant.  I was watching it while we drove.  I noticed that it appeared to be jumping around in the sky.  I asked my then boyfriend to stop the car and look at it too.  We parked the car and watched this round light jump all over the sky in a random pattern.  It would then hover and move again.  We watched this for awhile and then though it would be fun to watch it from the swings at the beach.  We drove to the beach watching it, parked the car and watched it.  Sat on the swings not moving and watched it.  At one point we got scared because it moved move over the area we were sitting at and hovered.  It was still far enough up in the sky to be round but it was larger at this point.  Then while we were watching it got very bright and zoomed over the ocean at a great speed.  The light left a! tail that went away as fast at the light it self did. In a second it was gone.  We both remember this day exactly how it happened.  It was the one and only time we every saw anything like this.  I finally wanted to share this event after all this time.
