Three white ovals were seen floating in sky over cul-de-sac.;2001-12-22 15:08:00;15 seconds;Three white ovals were seen floating in sky over cul-de-sac. My friend and I were passing a football on a cul-de-sac at the end of my street,when a comercial airliner flew by low.  We continued to pass the football after the plane had left.  A few minutes later, we saw 3 small white ovals floating around in the sky where the plane had flown earlier. The first oval flew slowly towards the sun in the west and the 2nd soon followed.  The third started to follow,then changed direction and went the opposite way.  It turned slightly and I saw a metalic flash.  After about 15 seconds the ovals were gone.  We ran back to my house and got binoculars and a camera.  We returned and watched for the ovals again. Two small private planes flew by low but they didn't look like the things we saw, plus the third oval had changed direction and planes can't do that.  The sky was also clear and sunny.;41.3148;-72.6994
