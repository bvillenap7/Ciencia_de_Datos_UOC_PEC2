I remarked how blue the sky was today and that there were no chemtrails. ( seems like an everyday occurance) We saw an airplane to the left which was flying west to east. To the east of the airplane, we both saw a circular, white shape that was at first flying east , but then seemed to zig-zag side to side , then move vertical as well. We had to keep moving to keep it in our sight, as when we moved , trees would hamper our sight. We observed this object for about 1 minute, and both remarked how we wished we had brought our cameras today, since the snow that had fallen yesterday had made everything look so pretty. In comparison to the airplane it had to have been larger, because it was higher in elevation. We kept moving to keep it in veiw, but either disappeared from our sight or vanished in an instant because after approximately 1 minuter we no longer saw it any where in the sky.;41.3148;-72.6994

There are hundreds of them. I would be happy to show you and send some pictures I have taken. 2 years ago I saw what looked like a gray saucer leaving from this area. Happy hunting.
