Green luminesent object with contrail impacts ocean, lights up Guilford CT sky.;2007-08-18 00:00:00;.5 - 1 min;Green luminesent object with contrail impacts ocean, lights up Guilford CT sky. I am reporting this sighting as a second hand source primarily as a service to those involved in the laudable efforts of this site.   Secondly, it was pure coincidence that I happened to hear this story behind this encounter and I fear it would have taken a grand effort to encourage the people involved to file a report.   And so, in brief here are the details of the event as I heard them from three separate adult females living as neighbors in a small coastal enclave in Guilford, CT. At roughly around midnight on August 18, 2007, a comet-like, highly-luminescent and glowing green object appeared descending in a rapid fashion towards the surface of the ocean.  The object, which traveled in a consistent, linear trajectory was additionally noted to have a bright contrail which seemed to wax in intensity as it neared its duly inevitable impact.   Upon impact I was told there was no discernable noise but a great flash of light that illuminated the entire panorama of the community and ocean.  When the witnesses were questioned about how certain they were of the objectâ€™s identity as a comet or a meteor all three seemed to balk.  Although none admitted to witnessing anything extraordinary about the object's actions, they were wholly unwilling to commit to excluding the object as being something else, i.e. a military craft, plane crash or UFO.
