I could not hear it as it approached, only see it.  I could not hear it until it was directly overhead.  It was extremely quiet ... not like the government planes that occasionally fly low over the area and are extremely loud.   When I got back to the house, I told my son and daughter-in-law what I had saw.  My daughter-in-law had been out back of the house as it passed overhead and confirmed what I saw.;41.6282;-72.3594
