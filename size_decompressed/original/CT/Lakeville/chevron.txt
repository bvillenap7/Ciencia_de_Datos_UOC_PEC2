It then made a 180 deg turn to the south.  We raced down to the main road to follow it. As we neared Lakeville it was just dropping out of sight. We went into the lounge at Interlaken Inn and reported to our friends. They too had ran outside to watch it. It flew over at abt 1000 ft. and made no sound. The nite was clear & many small planes were flying. The lights were very white and steady. This was the second time I've seen it.;41.9525;-73.4422
