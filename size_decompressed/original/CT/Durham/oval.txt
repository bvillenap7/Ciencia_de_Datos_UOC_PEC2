By the time we went back, it was gon My mom and I were driving near our house in Durham tonight at about 8:40 pm.  We had noticed a weird light in the sky - except it was strange.  Have you ever seen one of those balloons that are on a stick?  It looked like that - but 3D which had made it even more strange.  There were about 6-10 bright oval - like lights on it, but more underneath, if you looked at a kitchen bowl and you see the bottom edge like they were lined up in a row.  It was not moving, it was hovering, and it also looked as if it was IN Durham..not far in the sky.  By the time we turned around to see it (we were driving so we pulled over) it had been hovering in a field off of a main road. It had disappeared in those 1 minute / 2 minutes from turning around.;41.4647;-72.688
