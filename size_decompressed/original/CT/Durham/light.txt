It was flying very low and brightly lit as thought there were spot lights. with I believe some blinking lights.  But it was almost silent.  It hovered in one spot ...we could see it from our house...on the third floor. I went out side on balcony and it was almost silent...then it just moved quickly and silently overhead and was gone.;41.4647;-72.688
