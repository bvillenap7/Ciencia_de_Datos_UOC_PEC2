rocket shape traveling south to north, no noise.;2005-10-31 16:00:00;2 minutes;rocket shape traveling south to north, no noise. Looked as if it was in orbit, steady path from south to north.  Absolutely no noise heard.  Silvery white in color.  High reflectance from the late afternoon sun.   Wondering if it is some sort of Govt, or private satellite, or rocket.

Elongated, lit shapes above New Milford.;2014-03-15 22:00:00;2 hours;Elongated, lit shapes above New Milford. The two objects stayed stationary for nearly two hours.  Identical, elongated shapes with predominately red lights mixed with some blue and white ones.  Little blinking. The two looked some miles apart but were both about 30 degrees above horizon line. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect an evening sighting, and have changed the time above.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Hi,   You are correct, it was 10 p.m.  I stopped watching about midnight and they were still there. At 1 a.m. they were gone.   I have looked and looked online to find similar images but have been unsuccessful. The lights were so  bright in the sky, and to just sit in a stationary position for so long.   Thanks,   ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM));41.5781999999999;-73.4150000000007
