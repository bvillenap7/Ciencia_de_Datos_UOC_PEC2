Was outside above house and barn about ten feet above barn hovered in silence and then moved approx 3 miles an hour with a buzzing sound like a blimp almost.   Had three white lights and one red beneath them.  Flashing.   Continued to move towards New York for twenty minutes.  At same pace.  Only 69-75 feet above ground.  Very quiet very slow and eerie.  I videoed it for two minutes but my cell phone only shows black fuzz with a little sound for one second.  Very strange.  Very awesome.  Not sure what it was.  But it's a very clear starry night tonight. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));41.5781999999999;-73.4150000000007
