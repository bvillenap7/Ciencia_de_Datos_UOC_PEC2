A set of jet like wings appeared on each side that resembled light beams.  Craft appeared to just be a very bright complex stationary star as above for 30 minutes, then suddenly the craft moved from the mid northern sky overhead sideways towards the north just as a high flying jet would although the two wings were perpendicular to the movement and a bright beam shined its norhternly path like a long headlamp beam.  It moved quietly out of sight. At first this stationary object appeared just to be the most brilliant star in the sky, between north and south horizons, and as far away as all the other stars. This event lasted from 9:00 pm EDT to 9:50 EDT. The UFO returned without notice, and when I tried to take a photo, the object appeared now to be a horseshoe shape of about 9 attached lights that changed their brilliance so my photo wasn't clear.   When it returned it took a place at the same altitude but a bit more in the southern sky. It moved slowly as the stars move across the night sky until it was directly in line with Jupiter making it impossible to distinguish the planet from the object possibly in front of it, but Jupiter had become the brightest object in the southerly sky by this time;41.5781999999999;-73.4150000000007

I stood on my porch thinking what is that, no sound, it was much to small to be an airplane. All of a sudden one passed over me and exploded into a beautiful burst of different colors then suddenly disappeared.  I'm still in shock by what I saw, however it was the prettiest sight.  Once again, absolutely no sound or fireworks smell.;41.5781999999999;-73.4150000000007
