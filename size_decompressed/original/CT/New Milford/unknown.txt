I was at a stopsign when i noticed colored lights in the sky in the left field of my vision.  I looked up and noticed a straight horizontal line of 3-4 lavendar purple colored lights with a small red light in the middle of the line.  I watched this light as i drove for a few minutes.   Then i noticed a set of simliar lights enter from the right side of my field of vision in the sky.  They were orange-red in color.  As the lights from the right side of the sky moved towards the lights on the left side of the sky, they shanged into the purple lavendar color as the object on the left.  I noticed they stood apart from each other in a horizontal line for a few minutes than abruptly the lights on the right moved on top of the lights on the left.   They began to circle around each other for a few minutes. As i drove along i looked to see if the lights could be emanated from the ground.  They were so high up, and the area so rural it seem! ed difficult if not impossible, for these lights to be shining from the ground.  There was not a light trail that would indicate they came from the ground (such as a laser or spot light).   I have never seen any type of aircraft in that same color or manuever in the manner i have witnessed.  My instincts felt these were UFOs.  As i drove along after 10 minutes of seeing the objects they simply disappeared.  Right before they disappeared i was driving on top of large mountain with a field stretching both sides of the road.  I had a clear view of the objects and could tell they were high up in the sky and some type of aircraft.  I began to feel frightened, and started to drive away at a fast rate.  Shortly thereafter they disappeared.;41.5781999999999;-73.4150000000007
