At 8:00 pm, Nov. 22, 2012, on a clear, dark sky east of New Milford,Ct, we saw a bright red, round ufo with red and blue rays emitting from the entire diameter.  Bigger than any star or planet, it moved slowly from south to north for about 1 min., paused, and changed direction heading east.  At this point all rays disappeared, and it dissipated and slowly disappeared.;41.5781999999999;-73.4150000000007
Formation over New Milford, CT.;2013-07-06 22:00:00;5-7 minutes;Formation over New Milford, CT. On July 6, 2013, at 10:00 p.m., eight eye witnesses saw....... a caravan of unidentifiable flying vehicles in the Northville corridor of Litchfield County over Route 202 in New Milford, CT....... Unfortunately, no one had a camera.   The vessels that approached above the trees were flying in a one up one down, perfectly synchronized formation with a bright, iridescent, glowing orange ring at each angle with brown tentacles illuminating from each ring.    This unidentifiable fleet of ships silently came out of the north from the Marbledale area of Route 202 (Litchfield Rd) and exited going east in New Milford toward Washington.   Only minutes later, another caravan of six orange lights appeared just above the trees.  It was huge, there was one group of three in a triangular formation, and they hovered only momentarily tilted in flight showing off the beauty in the triangular shape, then continued to move and went as fast as they came.   Our group of eight, spooked eye witnesses, is baffled, not just sure how to explain the incident, and would like to know if anyone in the Marbledale, New Milford, New Preston or Washington area also reported the sighting?;41.5781999999999;-73.4150000000007
