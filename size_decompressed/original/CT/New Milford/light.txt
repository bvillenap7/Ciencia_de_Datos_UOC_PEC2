Formation reapper/dissapear in the night sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Venus.  PD));2007-04-08 22:00:00;1 week;Formation reapper/dissapear in the night sky Over the last week, every night after 9:00 pm, a light sometimes in more of a disc form, shows up in the sky and can be seen from my backyard.  The first few sightings were of a blueish formation of lights and seemed to be in the shape of a baseball diamond.  This blueish formation got bigger and smaller, and seemed to hover in the same area and stayed all night.  The next night the same blueish formation was seen again, however this sighting was slightly farther away from the original spot.   The next night it was consistent with the day before's sighting.  Over the last few days, it has been cloudy here so if the formation was there, it was not seen by myself or the other witness.  Tonight was the most interesting of all the sightings so far.  At 9:00 pm est, I went outside and there was a new light, this time it was a bright white/blue light, and seemed to be in a disc formation.  Over the course of 10 minutes, the light got dimmer.  In an effort to take a picture, I let the flash on my camera go off, which in turn, seemed to cause a reaction to the formation, because the formation lit up at least ten times brighter than before.  Over the next five minutes, I also noticed that the original blue formation was visible, but both formations were still very far from one another.  As I was looking at the new formation, I noticed a commercial airplane flying towards the formation, and the airplane was going to fly over the formation.  As soon as the airplane was about to fly over the formation, the lights on the formation dimmed drastically, and seemed to disappear in the night sky.  The most interesting part was that after the plane was out of sight, the formation lit up again, and stayed lit.  As far as I can see, the formation is still presently in the sky, and has stayed extremely bright.;41.5781999999999;-73.4150000000007
Star-like object in the sky with beam of light directed down to earth;2009-09-19 19:52:00;on or two minutes;Star-like object in the sky with beam of light directed down to earth We were driving home with the top of our car down, along Route 67.  I looked up and saw a bright light high up in the sky. It was similar to, but slightly larger than a star or planet.  A beam of light emanated from the star.  The beam was directed down, like the tail of a comet.   After a minute or so, the light disappeared but the beam was still visible, although fading quickly.

bright white light  stands in the sky in conneticut.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Venus??  PD));2010-06-29 21:00:00;8:30-9:30;bright white light  stands in the sky in conneticut we saw a bright white light off in the distance that wasnt moving and we knew it wasn't a star because the sky was still light blue so stars could not be seen.  It would dissapear then reappear in a different location that was still some what close to the original location.  We watched it until it became dark out and we could see other stars and it was still much brighter than all the other stars.

Bright white light hovering.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a star or a planet.  No photo.  PD));2010-07-19 01:00:00;1 1/2 hrs;Bright white light hovering There was a star like, white light hovering in the sky.  It wasn't a plane, nor a planet, because it was too close.  This was confirmed for my sight, because I could see a commercial airliner way up past the object in the sky, I could see the stars.  Whatever this was it looked to be just over our town, looked like it was just observing.  It would sway out slightly then back to it's original position, as it did this I also noticed the light casting  out  lines onto a diamond shaped craft.  It also seemed to move closer, then back again, each time it moved I could see the shape of it.  I watched it for about an hour and a half, it was still there when I went to bed, and it was still changing it's position.  No sound was present, no blinking lights.

Bird sized illuminated UFO fly's at a extremely high speed and low altitude past me several times.;2015-08-19 21:30:00;10-20 seconds;Bird sized illuminated UFO fly's at a extremely high speed and low altitude past me several times. The UFO was sighted while I was walking my dog at approximately 9:30 pm. The UFO moved very quickly at an incredibly low altitude. The UFO illuminated warm colors (Orange Yellow Red) that I could not isolate due to its speed. The high speed caused to lights to streak across the sky. The UFO flew in a exact same swooping motion 3 time very quickly.  A very similar motion to a boomerang. The UFO was about the size of a bat or medium sized bird. The UFO made no noise as it flew. The UFO's altitude ranged from approximately 8 feet to approximately 20 feet as it made it's swooping motion. The UFO swooped downward behind my house and was not spotted again.  To be honest when I first saw it I was more curious than spooked.   After it dipped out of sight that quickly changed and I made my way inside not looking behind me for it.   A few minutes later I peered outside the window with not luck.;41.5781999999999;-73.4150000000007
