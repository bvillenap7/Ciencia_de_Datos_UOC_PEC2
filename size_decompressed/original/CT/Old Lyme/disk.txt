Teenage Boy.;2013-05-26 22:00:00;3 seconds;Teenage Boy Basically I was trying to fall asleep on a somewhat cloudy day with a full moon.  I was having trouble falling asleep because at the lake near my house people were shooting off fireworks because it was the day before Memorial Day.   There are skylights in my room that are angled at 45 degrees so while I was lying on my side I was staring out one.  I can usually see aircraft towards the top of the window flying around but it’s just planes and such.  While I was staring out the window a pencil shaped object that had lights on it went flying by.  It was close to the ground and traveling very fast.  It made no noise and was going in a straight line from east to west.   I do not do drugs or drink which is why I am very confused about what I saw.   I did further research about UFO’s in Old Lyme and found out a similar story that described the same craft I saw which took place five years earlier.  Thanks you for reading;41.3334;-72.3057
