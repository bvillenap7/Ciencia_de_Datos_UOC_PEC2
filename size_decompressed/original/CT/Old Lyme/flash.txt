white (looked like a planet) with red and green flashing around it, like police lights. CT.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible star??  PD));2006-10-30 17:45:00;half hour;white (looked like a planet) with red and green flashing around it, like police lights. Connecticut I was looking toward the west trying to find a comet that I had read about last week.   I noticed a blinking mostly white/ red / green light that looked like a plane.  For a half hour it stayed in the same spot, moving lower on the horizon behind a tree until I couldn't see it anymore.    At first I thought it was a hovering helicopter, but it did not move.   Very evident Green and Red flashing around the white center. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the witness was observing a twinkling star, but that is only a guess.  We have corrected the date above.

During early morning rainy weather, saw very bright flash with no visible source. This only occurred for a few seconds.  The space outside was like a light box as bright as sunlight.
