extremely fast pure white object over old lyme no noise or trail;2008-08-11 20:00:00;second;extremely fast pure white object over old lyme no noise or trail standing in driveway, as usual looking up towards sky facing west . night was typical, clear with few large low clouds. moon was bright could see tops of clouds and a bit through them ( like a full moon in winter ) was about three cloud patterns, two close together, the third in line closest to me with a bit of distance from the other two. I happened to look more straight up towards twelve oclock, i then saw what i could describe as   short fat number two pencil rounded not sharpened at both ends it was pure white colored(bright white) , i just caught glimpse berfore it went into first cloud, as it went over second cloud it lit up cloud like lightening, but only for a split second. it made no noise, had no trail like a shooting star, and looked like it was moving in a straight line ( not arched up or moving downward, perfect like an arrow ) biggest thing is how fast  i first saw until it was gone with no noise whatsoever and how straight with no trail front or rear!!  someone else over eastern connecticut shoreline had to see it that night!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!;41.3334;-72.3057
