Large object with two slow flashing lights. slowly moving near D.E.P fishing area;2012-08-11 21:40:00;10 minutes;a large object with two slow flashing lights. slowly moving near D.E.P fishing area While I wad fishing along the Connecticut  river at around 11 pm there was a large object in the sky.  It was moving east to west.  I was able to see the silhouette of the object, which was very large.  It had two slow blinking lights, one in the front and back.  It was not moveing at a fast past, like hovering with no sound.  Without turning the object started moving north and became out of view.  This was not a plane because there were some in the distance.;41.3334;-72.3057
((HOAX??  One of several silly reports from same anonymous source.))  Similar bright-star sighting as other reports.;2015-03-06 00:00:00;15 minutes;Similar bright-star sighting as other reports. Similar bright-star sighting as other reports. Around midnight above tree line mid sky a bright star is visible. Most of the time it is not moving, suggesting it is perhaps the North Star or part of a constellation. Sometimes it appears to be very slowly moving - not fast enough to be flying, just enough movement to be noticeable. Beyond the situation (the star) something seemed slightly off.
