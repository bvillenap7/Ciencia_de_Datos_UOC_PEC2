spots in the sky that appear suddenly and disappear just as suddenly ... photographed;2009-01-03 16:40:00;3 min;spots in the sky that appear suddenly and disappear just as suddenly ... photographed On 1/3/09 I was photographing a sunset and noticed a white spot appear in my camera below cloud level that hadn’t been visually preceded by anything in that part of the sky. It didn’t appear to be a plane due to the absence of blinking lights or any lead up to its appearance. It clearly didn’t seem to be a satellite since it was below cloud level. The event became more peculiar because then a second bright spot appeared next to it for about a minute and then one of the two disappeared (a hard thing for a satellite or plane to do, if that’s what they were.)  After three minutes, I lost view of any spot in the nearly dark sky. The reason I decided to report this is because I photographed a series of eight very clear images of that three minute span and continue to be baffled by looking at those pinpoints of light below cloud level. If viewing the images is deemed worth your while, I need some guidance as to how to do so.   The fact that there is such precise time related data on the camera further prompted me to write a report;41.3334;-72.3057
