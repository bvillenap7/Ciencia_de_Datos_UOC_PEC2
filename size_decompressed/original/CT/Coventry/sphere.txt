something niether me or my brother has seen before;2008-10-03 19:40:00;7:40 PM;something niether me or my brother has seen before It was about 7:40PM and we were in my porch watching T.V. and my younger brother spotted something in the sky above the lake to what appeared to be something circular with a a bunch of lights and weird light figures around it. It looked liked the brightest thing we have ever seen in the night sky. My older brother who is 28 years old said he saw something similar about 10 years ago. He also pointed out that if it was a plane we would have heard it and it didn't make any noise from what we tried to hear. My younger brother tried to take a video of it with his cellphone and didn't get any image from it. I also want to  point out that we couldn't see the reflection of it off the lake. Then when my brother tried to get closer to the lake and get a picture of it, it  went from where we could see it to a farther distance in a matter of seconds. Then it went to where we couldn't see it anymore.;41.7829;-72.3319
