I witnessed a UFO two days in a row, one being on the night of 9/23/2020 and the following night of 9/24/2020.  The first night I was walking out of the woods after a day of hunting and met up with my father. By this time it was around 7:30pm EST.  We both witnessed a VERY bright light moving in the sky.  At first I thought it was a satellite but it was much too low, big, and bright to be.  It was lower than a plane would be and we watched as it smoothly flew across the sky with 0 noise at all.  It didnâ€™t disappear until it got beyond the tree line.  The following night we were both in the same spot around the same time at night and it was pitch black.  As my father and I were talking I looked up and saw yet again a VERY BIG and BRIGHT light right above my head.  It hovered there for a second or two and then the light got dim all the way down to the size of a star and started moving like a satellite would.  But it was at a complete stop before it started moving.  I al! so saw a ufo last year and have a video of it flying through the sky.;41.7829;-72.3319
