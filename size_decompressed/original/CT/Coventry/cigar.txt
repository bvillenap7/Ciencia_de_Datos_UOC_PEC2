Two very bright lights in sky.;2010-08-08 20:05:00;2-3 minutes;Two very bright lights in sky. On August 8, 2010, at 8:05 pm in South Coventry, CT, my eye was drawn to the western sky where I saw an object the size of a baby's fist with 2 very bright lights in the shape of  surfboards moving in a easterly direction at a modest air speed.   It was at about 25,000 feet.  I couldn't tell if the lights were internal or external.   Both lights were coming from the same object.  I am sure they were lights and not the setting sun's reflection. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));41.7829;-72.3319
