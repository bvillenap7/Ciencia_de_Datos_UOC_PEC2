Orange/red large bright blob in night sky over Coventry.;2012-11-22 01:50:00;3 minutes;Orange/red large bright blob in night sky over Coventry On the way to my front door after working thanksgiving, i saw what appeared to be the moon in the sky above the treeline west of Coventry.  I thought the moon looked very large, and realized that it was too bight to be the moon, ans too red/orange.  Then within 4 minutes, the less than 1/2 circle slowly crept behind the horizon.;41.7829;-72.3319
