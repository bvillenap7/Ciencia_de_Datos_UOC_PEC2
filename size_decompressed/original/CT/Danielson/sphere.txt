Helicopter chasing red globe;2012-08-29 22:00:00;1 minutes;helicopter chasing red globe I was watching the Red Sox Game on TV.  It was the second inning when I heard a large helicopter outside.  I am not sure of the time but this can be used as a reference.  The sound was getting louder and louder so I went outside to see it. When it came into my field of vision I was astonished to see the chopper chasing a red globe. I would put the height of the chopper somewhere between 700 and 1000 feet.  The red globe was not brilliant but very visable and appeared about 500 ft in front of the craft moving in a straight line.  Due to obstructions I only had about a 20 second view of the objects.;41.797;-71.8857
