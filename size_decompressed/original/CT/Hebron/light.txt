A distant light moving straight up toward the sky.;2007-01-18 12:00:00;About Five minutes;A distant light moving straight up toward the sky. I was sitting in the bus, waiting to be let out when off in the distance, out above the woods I saw a bright light. I simply thought is was a star, still showing even thought it was a bit to bright to see any.  But then it started to move up, straight up towards the sky,  It couldn't be a plane because planes don't fly straight up, and helicopters don't go as high as this object did.  It just kept going up farther and farther until I couldn't see it anymore. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Three lights seen in the western sky, appeared one after another.;2015-11-29 22:35:00;20-25 minutes;Three lights seen in the western sky, appeared one after another I was in my bedroom about to fall asleep when I looked out the window, and saw a pulsing orange/red light in the western sky.  It hovered for a minute or two, and then began to slowly move north, and shot away.  A few minutes later, a similar light appeared in the exact same spot, like the first one, it hovered for a minute or two, and unlike the first one, it slowly moved to the south, and shot away.  Then another few minutes later, another light appeared suddenly in the same spot the second one was last seen, eventually it shot away, and nothing was seen after that.  During the sighting, there were some aircraft in the area, but none seemed to be trailing any of the lights.;41.6865;-72.4029
