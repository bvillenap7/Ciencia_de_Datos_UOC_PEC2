Several Orange/Red Globes -  Glowing Vessels - Black Forms;2012-08-12 20:37:00;10 minutes;Several Orange/Red Globes -  Glowing Vessels - Black Forms I was driving SE when I encountered several orange/red globes crossing over the road just above the tree line. I quickly turned around hoping to get another look since once the objects crossed the road they were no longer visible.   There were nine objects remaining when I turned around. I continued on my way marveling at what I had just seen.  I took a left on a road that runs perpendicular to the first road. About a mile up the road there is farm that spans both sides of the road, and this is where I encountered the orange/red globes again.  I pulled my car over and hopped out to get a better look, trying to figure out what I was seeing.  I watched as they headed from the Western tree line to the Eastern tree line. I could not believe what I saw next.  Between each globe was a vessel that had not been visible up until then.  The globes appeared to me to have been towing/escorting the vessels. The vessels were a reddish black and glowing along the edges, kind of like lava.  The vessels also appeared to have some sort of insignia on them. I have tried but I cannot draw the shape or the insignia well enough to do them justice.  I am not sure what became of the globes once the vessels became visible because I realized that after the first vessels appeared something large and black, separate from the vessels, was being dropped  over the trees.  The only way to describe the descending items is as black masses there is nothing that I have encountered thus far, real or fictional, that can help me describe what the masses looked like or what they could be. The globes, vessels and masses made no sounds that were audible to my ears.  I do not recall seeing any other aircraft in the sky at the time.;41.6865;-72.4029
