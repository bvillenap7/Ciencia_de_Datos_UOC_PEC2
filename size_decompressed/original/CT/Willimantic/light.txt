Super Bright Flashing Light.;2015-08-29 04:30:00;3 minutes;Super Bright Flashing Light. I was on the couch and had woken up to use the bathroom.  As soon as I returned to the couch and closed my eyes, I seen a bright flash so I immediately opened them..  I noticed a huge bright flashing white light traveling up the road.   I got up and went to the back door and watched this light moving really slowly go up the street, it stopped for a second and then it turned around and traveled in the opposite direction.  You could only see a bright white light when it flashed, other than that darkness.   There we no sounds at all and no vehicles driving by.  I figured someone was the source so I went outside to make sure there was nothing that could be causing the light.   Once I realized it was super quiet there was nobody,and nothing was happening outside it made me a little nervous, but I also came to the realization that it was definitely a UFO.   Upon googleing this light I found this website and decided to leave my experience.;41.7127;-72.2096
