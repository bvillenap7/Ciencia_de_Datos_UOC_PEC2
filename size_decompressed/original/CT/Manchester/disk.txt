Bright, big, yellow glowing disk staying motionless in the night sky, then disappearing,,, in Manchester, CT;2005-01-15 20:00:00;5 minutes;Bright, big, yellow glowing disk staying motionless in the night sky, then disappearing,,, in Manchester, CT Hello, I just found out about the ufocenter.com.  I wish I knew about it when this actually happened.  I am sorry to report it so late, but I hope this information helps somehow.  We didn't know where to email/call when it actually happened.   This is what our whole family witnessed:  About 2 years ago, in Manchester, Connecticut (we were coming out of John Harvard's restaurant at Bucklands Hills Mall), our whole family saw an object in the sky that looked like a bright yellow glowing round disk.  Many people around us were looking at the sky pointing at it, as well.  The object was as bright yellow as the moon (the moon was also visible).  It looked like a giant glowing doughnut in the sky. It stayed in one place completely motionless for a few minutes, then it suddenly disappeared and then we noticed it in a totally different parts of the sky (we thought it was the same object, but who knows), then it disappeared again and then we noticed it in another part of the sky, then it disappeared completely.  We (and all the people around us) were stunned.  We've never seen anything like that before.  Would love to find out some day what in the world that was. Strangely enough, and to my great surprise, my son mentioned the following day that his classmate said that her relatives in Mexico called that same night to tell them that they saw the glowing disc-like object behaving strangely in the sky (the same night we saw it).  I just thought I was in a twilight zone. Just thought I'd share this information with you, Best regards. E. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I looked up and seen what I thought at first was a plane but when I realized that it was not.;2016-01-25 20:14:00;1 minute;I was just coming from my neighbor's house, when I looked up and seen what I thought at first was a plane, but when I realized that it wasn't, I began to record.  I have a video that I slowed down to watch and trust me it wasnt a plane.   It was a disk shaped object that consist of 3 lights that formed around it like a belt 2 white 1 red (center light) and they were pulsating this thing just sat there and just swayed side to side no noise no smoke just whatever it was in the clear sky.   I'm in total shock I have a video and would like to know where can I go to get it checked out.;41.783;-72.5268151515151
Big, grey crescent shaped object in sky with multiple lights.;2021-04-14 20:00:00;1-2 minutes;Big, grey crescent shaped object in sky with multiple lights. Me and a friend were driving on Hillstown Road passing MCC. In the sky there was a crescent shaped object. I turn to my friend and asked her if she saw it too. She did and thought she was seeing things. It was a big, grey crescent shaped object in the sky that was stationary. We were maybe going 20-30 MPH and it didn’t move once. It stayed near the tree line. On the ends of the crescent shaped there were big bright lights. In the middle of it there were also lights, maybe about 3 of them. It couldn’t have been the moon because it was cloudy. She went to turn into MCC so we can record a video and it was gone. Disappeared within 2-3 seconds. There was no noise of a plane above or any noise for that matter.;41.783;-72.5268151515151
