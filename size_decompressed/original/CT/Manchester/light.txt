A bright star type of object, with controlled movement, that came to a stop then vanished.;2009-02-26 19:50:00;1 min. 30 sec.;A bright star type of object, with controlled movement, that came to a stop then vanished. While I was looking at the stars over my home,(i was facing south) I happened onto Orions Belt.  I started to scan the sky to the west, when I saw a bright object moving towards Orions Belt.  At first I thought it was just some space junk.   Then it stopped. It backed tracked,to the west, then it went south, stopped, then north, then it went to where where it first stopped, then continued on its original path.  It was heading for orions belt. Just to the northwest of the belt there is twin stars, they are faint, but you can see them with the naked eye.  As the objrct neared these stars, it stopped again.  But this time it got faint then it was gone.;41.783;-72.5268151515151
Blue-green light west of my home in Manchester making strange movements.;2014-09-03 02:30:00;1 hour;Blue-green light west of my home in Manchester making strange movements. I was looking out my window at night when I noticed some movement in the corner of my eye.  About west from my home, there was a blue-green light that was mostly stationary.  Occasionally, it would make maneuvers that no fixed wing craft, that I know of, can do. Its movements were occasional shifts towards or away from the horizon and occasionally left or right movements.  About an hour in, it had moved behind a series of trees and I could no longer see it. There are some other interesting facts about this thing.  This early morning (9/4/14) was the second time I've seen this thing now it was very close to the position it was yesterday morning.  It also appeared that there were faint reddish colored lights hovering near or moving away from this object. on 9/4/14 at about 3:30 AM or so, there were three consecutive bright flashes in the sky to the left of the craft.   My mother also witnessed the craft on the second day. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));41.783;-72.5268151515151
Orange spherical light, did not move, but disappeared at some point.  ((anonymous report));2017-07-18 05:00:00;Unknown;Orange spherical light, did not move, but disappeared at some point. Just one bright orange light visible, not moving, not twinkling, very visible, could not have been a planet.  Did not change location for the couple of minutes I could see it.   I tried to follow it while I was driving to assess what it could've been, but it disappeared at some point, and was not seen again.

Green orb flashing light and triangular red white blue craft;2019-07-07 21:35:00;3 minutes;Green orb flashing light and triangular red white blue craft Watching the manchester fireworks and a green light was continually flashing and immobile.  It stayed still for over a minute then sped towards direction of fireworks.  It looked much higher than the fireworks.  Then, sped to left and shot back in the opposite direction going higher until couldnâ€™t see it. 5 minutes later it returned to a nearby spot in the sky and moved about in the same manner.  Towards the end of the 23 minute show, another craft appeared.  It was triangular with a light on each tip..one red, one white, and one blue.  This was nowhere near the fireworks and the lights did not flash like an airplane.  There are airports nearby but this did not look like a plane.  It was high up too.  The police had heavy security for the fireworks snd had been using a drone earlier and it was unlit and had a distinct noise.  There was no noise coming from either of these objects.  My cell phone would not work when it got dark...could not reach server.;41.783;-72.5268151515151
