North/NorthWest bound UFO at approx 600-1000 MPH over Manchester, CT 1980-1981;1981-06-30 12:00:00;10-20;North/NorthWest bound UFO at approx 600-1000 MPH over Manchester, CT 1980-1981 Ok, well, from what I remember back around 1980 -1981, living in Manchester Connecticut, I had to be at lest  23-24 years old , my  wife at the time was 19-20 years old .  Sometime during the day We decided to go somewhere and leaving the apartment building we got inside my car.   As we backed up from our parking space we noticed a sphere shaped flying object around 25-100' diameter moving from the south -southwest.  I passed without sound at what seemed like an altitude of 1000-2000 feet up.  Now that I am much older and seen many Jet planes in flight can guess its speed.  It was moving at at least 600-1000 mile per hour. I said to her, look , see that? She saw it.  And as we began to drive forward in the car I noticed it was going behind  the roof of a neighboring apartment building.  We Rounded left on the drive way/ road and  catching sight of it again saw it moving/continuing northward in a perfectly straight line.  Then we just went about our business. Not gi! ving it any real thought as to what is was.   We didnâ€™t know what it was, so we forgot about  pretty quick.  It was a dull semi shining metal looking object , no windows, just  round shape. Almost like color of lead sinkers used in fishing and dull aluminum. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

My husband and I woke from a deep sleep to a strange blue orb outside our window.;2006-11-19 02:00:00;3 minutes;My husband and I woke from a deep sleep to a strange blue orb outside our window. This event happened very early in the morning.  My husband and I were sleeping and awoke suddenly without cause.  Our bedroom was illuminated in a pale blue glow.  For a split second I though our neighbors were outside and heir car lights were on, but he glow was much too bright to have been car lights.  Both my husband and I were unaccountably terrified.  All my hair was standing on end. I was too scared to turn and look out the window, I just felt like something was out there and looking at it would be horrible. we kept hearing a strange sound repeat itself over and over.  It was a high pitched ping...ping.   It would echo and fade and then repeat.   We finally looked out the window and saw a huge blue orb hovering stationary above the tree line.  He feeling this experience gave us was so extreme.  I really can't explain it in a way that makes sense.  We knew that the orb was something other.  We strongly felt that we were being observed, scru! tinized.  Our skin was tingling all over, vibrating kind of.   We turned away from the window and tried to ignore, but we couldn't shut our eyes because idea of closing our eyes with that strange light in the room and the orb so close outside was just terrifying eventually the noise stopped and the light faded away.  We turned to look and the orb was gone.   It was totally silent outside.  Our cat would not come in the room and didn't stop staring at the window for a while.  We have never found out what that orb was but we have spoken to several others who saw it that same night, but at different locations.  His orb was not far out in the atmosphere it was literally right outside our window, just above the trees.  It was approximately 40 times the size of a basketball.  About a year after that we were walking through a park late in the evening, I don't remember exactly what time, between 7 and 9.   We saw the orb again but only for a second, then it vanished and there was a loud boom, like thunder but it couldn't have been because it w! as snowi ng.  The power went out immediately after. It was so eerie. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));41.783;-72.5268151515151
watching object jump around sky for hours.  ((NUFORC Note:  Twinkling star.  PD));2011-11-04 22:00:00;3 plus hours;watching object jump around sky for hours There is something bright like venus which is so large you can see it turn.  It seems to continue to go from a bright star like object to turning red and blue and strobing colors.  It is making large leep frog aka like a water bug on the surface of a pond.  I have been watching it stop, start, jump, make random movements, small streak and back to its spot where it left off.  It still is there as I type this.  right now, it looks like a diamond and pure white, no flashes. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
