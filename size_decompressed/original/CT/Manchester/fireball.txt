Fireball over Manchester, CT;2013-07-10 22:15:00;few minutes;Fireball over Manchester, CT We were sitting on the deck and noticed this “fireball” coming toward my house.  At first I thought an Airplane was on fire.  But as it got closer, I noticed there was no noise, and it seemed to be kind of floating across the sky, not low but lower than the Airplanes that usually pass over, and looked like more of an orb with a light beam going around the inside of it, but not escaping the circle, so I wouldn't say it was emitting beams of light.  It continued that way until it went out of my line of sight.  It was a cloudy night, just had heavy rain and severe Thunderstorms a few hours before, even a funnel cloud the next town over in Coventry, CT.   I did take out my phone to record a video but I didn't do it right so I don't have a video.;41.783;-72.5268151515151
