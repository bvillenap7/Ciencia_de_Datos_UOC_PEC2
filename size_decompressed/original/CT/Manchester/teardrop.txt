Kinda creepy. ~ 9:10 PM September 14, 2015: ~ Two hours after sunset, I was out on my 3rd floor balcony, flying my quad copter, enjoying the lights on it (red, white and blue) very nice.  Flew it straight out from the balcony about 75 feet, while arching it upward to around 50-75 feet above ground and Swooooosh: in my peripheral vision to my slight right (10-20 degrees) I caught view of a tear drop shaped object pointed end first head swiftly to the West (more right) of my southern view.  Freaked me out a little, because it was illuminated by (what I will have to say) ambient light from the neighborhood, and streetlights.   The sky at the time was sparsely partly cloudy, low humidity, with fluffy clouds with very clear areas of visible blue (but dark) night sky, and, clear visible stars, jet planes etc.  Winds were calm.  Finished flying the quad and, wow, I was thinking, was this UFO stationary and just observing us, me, someone?  Did they (presuming there were little guys on b! oard) get startled because my quad flew out there toward them?  Was too funny-weird to not take this incident freak-me-out serious.  After a few maneuvers, I flew the quad copter back to the balcony and got goose bumps. P.S.--My guesstimate of its speed is ~250-300 mph, and possibly a bit more, as it began to fade from sight at 50 degrees to the right.  I first caught perisight of it seemingly out of nowhere  (Swoooooooooooooooooosh) and then vanished the same way it appeared.
