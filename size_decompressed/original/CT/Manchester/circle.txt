Clear night with one bright circular object, aura, captivating;2020-01-24 18:50:00;2 hours;Clear night with one bright circular object, aura, captivating One circular bright and blinking foreign object in the sky.  Did not move. Blinked a bright white light, was not constant.  Very bright, nothing around it.  No sounds that I could here. I watched this thing in the sky for well over 20 minutes.  Did not move.  Was a bit difficult to capture a clear cut image on phone.  I took photos and videos.  Had some sort of off white colored aura when looked at through a camera lens.  After going back inside I felt very odd. Very low on energy, a bit lightheaded and a bit of vertigo. It stayed in the same spot not too high in the sky for about 2 hours.;41.783;-72.5268151515151
