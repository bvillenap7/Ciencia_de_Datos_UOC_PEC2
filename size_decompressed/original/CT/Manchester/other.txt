I was driving home from my parents'in East Windsor,through South Windsor onto Route 30 towards East Hartford. It was still light out. There was a large irredescent white object hovering silently and motionless below the moon (new moon, I think) with a small jet ascending beside it at a 45 degree angle, as if to fly above it. The object wlooked like a cigar with two fins, much like the profile of a sun dial but with an extra fin. It was a strange white, like the moon but was too far below the moon to have been confused with it. I drove a mile on Route 30 before I stopped at a cul de sac to observe. I got scared and continued on my way home. About 2-3 minutes on my way, I saw what seemed a large commercial, passenger airplane hovering noiseless about 100-200 feet above the trees, above a house. Both the unidentified object and the passenger airplane hovered as if set upon invisible pedestals, while the jet flying ovetr the u.f.o. was ascending quickly, either to investigate/attack the u.f.o, or to avoid its path. The passenger plane was close to me, nowhere near the u.f.o. The next day I noticed two small, private-like planes flying around and lots of chemtrails.;41.783;-72.5268151515151
Huge bright orange semi-circle hovering over house;2011-12-04 01:00:00;2 minutes;Huge bright orange semi-circle hovering over house Looking out of my back yard, which is heavily wooded with some houses, I saw a huge and bright orange semi-circle hovering over neighbor’s house.  It looked almost like a planet and to verify it wasn’t the moon,  I went to the front of my house.  When I returned, it was gone.  It was there for about 2 minutes.;41.783;-72.5268151515151
Moving Groups of Light over Manchester, Connecticut.;2015-11-18 01:58:00;Ongoing;Moving Groups of Light over Manchester, Connecticut. To Whom It May Concern,   For the last five days, November 13, 2015 – November 18, 2015, my father and I have been observing several pairs and trios of lights moving in the night sky over Manchester, Connecticut, USA. They move in all directions without any visible signs of turning, and the behavior is unlike that of an Airliner or meteorite entering the atmosphere.  The points of light appear to move in unison, with one brighter point always leading a dimmer tail end. We've watched them for between 10 – 60 minutes, and have used a telescope during several of these viewings, just to be absolutely positive, the first night we chased one across the sky with the telescope, as it wouldn't stay still.  During a couple of these viewings, we could clearly see lights alternating between blue and red, which initially lead me to believe these were airplanes, but with further observation I noticed they did not in fact behave at all like any jet I've seen, moving in any direction at will, as I've said before, seemingly without turning. Just tonight we observed three of these pairs/trios as of 1:50 am, and on 11/15/2015 we witnessed no less than five.  We plan to continue these observations, hopefully with the aid of a video camera for further proof.;41.783;-72.5268151515151
