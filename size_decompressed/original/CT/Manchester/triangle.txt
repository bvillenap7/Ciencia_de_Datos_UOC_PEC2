White triangular craft flying low and slow over Manchester CT.;2002-10-24 15:15:00;60 seconds;White triangular craft flying low and slow over Manchester CT. On October 24th 2002 I was standing on my deck and heard what sounded like a low flying prop plane. I looked up and saw a low flying triangular shaped craft. The color being white. I called for my Daughter to come out and witness this strange craft. I did not believe this to be an ultralight craft as it was too large and too loud. There were no apparent windows or a cockpit. There was no apparent landing gear or propellers. It left no contrail. The sky was bright blue with few high thin clouds, none of which were above the said craft. The craft was moving fairly slow coming from the west and heading east. Less than one minute after the craft passed over my house a military helicopter followed the same exact flight path but was moving fast. I thought this might have been some sort of military drone but have yet to find any examples that fit the exact shape of the craft we saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Might have been a VariViggen experimental aircraft, but that is a guess.  It may also have been a piece of military equipment.  PD));41.783;-72.5268151515151
3  slow to fast moving red lights hovering over  manchester;2011-12-16 21:00:00;10 min;3  slow to fast moving red lights hovering over  manchester At @9:00pm we saw a red light we thought was a light from a tower, but there aren't any towers on our street.  We watched the light and a second one appeared next to the other one. In the blink of an eye they were right on the side of our car.  They hovered over the area for @5 mins, then a third one appeared in the blink of an eye next to the other two.  They made no sound what so ever.  Two lights left and the third stayed and they made until they were almost out of sight, then the third one left faster then I have ever seen anything fly.;41.783;-72.5268151515151
