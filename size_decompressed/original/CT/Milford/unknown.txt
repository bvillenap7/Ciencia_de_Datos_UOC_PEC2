Facing South/Southwest about 5 miles away a light sat in the sky for roughly 40 minutes. Light appeared to be something like from an aircraft in fog, could see it pointing in 1 direction. Problem being, light did not move for 40 minutes as said earlier. I called family members who went to the beach to see in another city, they saw the light as well. I also talked to 1 airline pilot who also reported seeing the light all the way up from NYC. Called radar tower and said no known aircraft were on radar nor in area.

It was a red and orange cloudy glow with an uneven yellow border. Estimate it to be about 3000 feet doing around 250 kts;2012-06-06 21:15:00;3 to 5 minutes;((Woman's name deleted/wife)) and I were driving home on New Haven Ave, about 15 Minutes ago and observed what looked to be a UFO.  Not a Joke.  It was moving from southwest to northeast.   We pulled over to the side of the road and got out to get a better look.  No sound, not moving very fast what got my attention is the lighting.  It was a red and orange cloudy glow with an uneven yellow border.  Estimate it to be about 3000 feet doing around 250 kts.  No white tail light or navigation red and green light.  Another guy stopped to see what we were looking at and observed the same thing.   We watched it cruise northeast bound until out of sight.  Been an Air traffic Controller for 31 years and never observed lights like that. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with both witnesses, husband and wife, and they both sounded to us to be exceptionally capable, sober-minded, individuals.  We suspect they are both very good witnesses.

What was really weird was on the video you could hear crickets and frogs clear as day, then when the flash happens, you could hear a strange sound as soon as it flashes it is kinda like a buzzing sound or like an electrical buzzing sound.  AGAIN ONLY WHEN IT FLASHED ITS LIGHT and it was moving very very slow in a zigzag line.?????   I'm stumped because I just don't understand how my phone could pick up sound coming from a light, unless it was some kind of propulsion.  Anybody have an explanation.;41.2195589473685;-73.0573484210525

The light was very white and bright and seemed to slowly move across the woods. There was no sound and the light seemed to come from above.;41.2195589473685;-73.0573484210525
