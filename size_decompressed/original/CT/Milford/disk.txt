Witnessed a silver disk in 1970;1970-06-15 13:00:00;3 minutes;witnessed a silver disk in 1970 I was 5 years old, playing football in the street with friends and dads. I remember looking up into the sky and seeing a sliver disk hovering below the clouds. It made no sound. At this age I knew what a plane was, and what a helicopter was. This was neither. It was a silver disk. I remember pulling on my fatherâ€™s pants asking him what it was. He and all the other adults were freaking out. He said he did not know. It hovered for about 3 mins, then shot off like a rocket and was gone. It took me 30 years to get my father to admit he saw something and acknowledge it really happened.  Approximately 8 years ago I saw a stealth bomber fly, it had the exact same characteristics of the disk I saw as a child. Gave me the chills.;41.2195589473685;-73.0573484210525
Saw five craft  and observed signaling after work.;1976-12-03 15:30:00;2 hours;Saw five craft  and observed signaling after work. As reported to MUFONCT:  After coming home from work I observed a white fluorescent cigar shaped object 60ft high and 35 ft away at closest point.  The object was about 20 ft long and about 6' high.  It moved into the southern sky about 1 mi away stayed and burst into a gigantic sparkler...which then moved in a straight line and exploded two more objects from itself.  Those two began to signal me by movements then went past their mother --then they began to turn red and blink then disappear over horizon.  I got into my car to chase mother, as I viewed it thru binoculars I raised the binoculars upward and observed the black crescent UFO which nearly filled my entire field of view.  I lowered the bino. and noted that it was several hundred feet in the air.  I ran to my car and encountered a mystery man who began to bang on my window. talked with him for a minute then drove to the police station.  Upon arriving home, I saw a chevron cloud formation, raised binoculars to one cloud and saw a classic flying saucer (hump above and below center line) which came from cloud with rotating disk and alternate red and green lights attached to disc.  It approached me and looked as if it would hit the house in which I stood--I hid behind storm door and watched saucer float above my neighbors house across the street--about 50 ft away and about 50  ft high.  Stepped outside as it veered off to the western horizon, where it hovered...after a few moments it came back towards me, turned on its axis and the rotating dissk turned on end moved to the right and disappeared piecemeal as if moving into a cut into the very sky.;41.2195589473685;-73.0573484210525
