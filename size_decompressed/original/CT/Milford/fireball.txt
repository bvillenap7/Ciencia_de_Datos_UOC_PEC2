Vertical formation of Glowing orange lights seen over Silver Sands State Park in Milford Ct.;2012-09-12 23:13:00;2 minutes;Vertical formation of Glowing orange lights seen over Silver Sands State Park in Milford Ct. I let my dog out the back of my yard and saw a formation of orange lights in a vertical formation of orange lights comming over toward my house near Silver Sands State Park.  I asked my room mate to come out and he saw them as well.  He wen't in to get a camera but they had begun to fade. He tried to take a picture but nothing good.  They were extremely bright to begin with and made no noise even as they got closer.  After about a minute as they got closer they started to get duller but I could still tell there was some kind of craft there.  We both are professionals and have never reported or seen anything like this before.;41.2195589473685;-73.0573484210525
Sequence of five orange lights in identical transit;2012-10-05 21:17:00;15 minutes;Sequence of five orange lights in identical transit ((NUFORC Note:  One of six sightings from same source, submitted over the course of two months.  PD)) This is a sequel to sightings from 8/18, 9/02, 9/19 at this location. Arrived Gulf Beach on Friday 7PM.  Wind from SW 5+mph.  Sunset at 7:10PM. While waiting, observed a couple nearby light and release a pale blue/green Chinese wind lantern . Tracked with binoculars as it drifted to NNE.  Completely dissimilar to the following:  Start:  9:17PM, @8 degrees above Fort Trumbull (about half a mile away at 300 degrees NW) The first hazy orange light emerged, appearing to swerve abruptly from a SE to a NE course, (wind at this time had shifted to the SE).  Floating steadily, it gradually rose to @ 35 degree elevation (below 1,000 feet altitude), then maintained constant speed and altitude as it continued into the NE. Appearance was a quasi Kong Ming “Hero” Chinese sky lantern.  Much larger in size than such lanterns normally are (Corrected estimate from previous one = 10-25 ft diameter) , this cone shaped red/yellow/orange light’s top-most funnel shaped portion shifted erratically from side to side as if buffeted by wind, even though the object’s transit was a smooth, steady floating speed of 45 – 75 mph.  I must emphasize that the wind was blowing from the NW directly into my face.  After 3 minutes this orange oval began to flicker, then winked out at 20 degrees NE (about 3.5 miles away). Using a Lumix SZ15 I tried to zoom in and take burst photos and HD video.  Simultaneously, I attempted to paint the UFO with a green laser, while also observing it through 7X35 binoculars – an obviously frustrating experience.  No apparent response to laser, though all objects remained – for the first time since June – out of the laser’s 2,500 ft range, therefore I was also unable to “paint” any of them.  Some useful photos and video obtained. This UFO was followed by four subsequent UFOs, each appearing from the same location and each transiting almost identically from the NW to the NE.  Each UFO in this sequence appeared only after the previous one had drifted completely away and finally winked out. The final UFO blinked out at 9:35PM. Peculiar note:  This was my fifth sighting at this location, taking place on the fifth of the month and, for the very first time, involving five objects.;41.2195589473685;-73.0573484210525
Six Flaming Flying Objects - Identified - Case Closed;2012-11-05 18:20:00;10 minutes;Six Flaming Flying Objects - Identified - Case Closed This is my 8th, and final, sighting event at Milford’s Gulf beach location. Between 6:20-6:30PM, civil twilight, observed a series of six brilliant orange orbs ascending from the opposite shoreline, due west, and gliding SE.  Each light traveled about 1.5 miles at an altitude of about 250 ft before it disappeared from view and was replaced by another, aloft from the same location. Through 10x25 Nikon binoculars I watched someone on the opposite beach involved in launching the last two of these lights.  Flashing a 5mW green laser in that direction seemed to have an affect: no further lights arose. Immediately driving around the Milford marina to this opposite shore of the Gulf, I met a group of partiers around a bonfire who admitted to launching several kong ming type paraffin sky lanterns.  Two of these which failed to go aloft were still on the beach for me to examine. MYSTERY SOLVED:  Milford obviously has more than its share of hot-air balloon/sky lantern users in various areas.  These are not necessarily hoaxers, mostly folks just out to have some fun.  The “swarm” of dozens of lights which I reported taking place on 10/13 originated from a sports bar/restaurant – some sort of celebration. Therefore, to save others undue waste of time and effort, I offer… ANATOMY OF A FAUX UFO:  IF IT LOOKS LIKE A BRIGHT FLAMING ORB WITH A HAZE AROUND IT, IT IS A SKY LANTERN. IF IT APPEARS CIRCULAR, BUT ALSO APPEARS TO CHANGE INTO A CYLINDER, OR HAVE A CYLINDER ATTACHED TO IT, IT IS A SKY LANTERN. IF IT LOOKS LIKE A CANDLE INSIDE A BUBBLE, IT IS A SKY LANTERN. IT IF RESEMBLES A FLARE ATTACHED TO A PARACHUTE, IT IS A SKY LANTERN. IT THE BRIGHT LIGHT FLOATS OR GLIDES SOUNDLESSLY OVERHEAD ONLY TO FLICKER AND/OR SUDDENLY WINK OUT, IT IS A SKY LANTERN. IF IT SEEMS FLAME-LIKE, ESPECIALLY IF IT IS YELLOW-ORANGE-RED, AND ITS FLAME SEEMS TO BE SWAYING OR WAVERING, IT IS A SKY LANTERN. I realize how unusual these things appear – particularly since I have witnessed some types of them being launched right in front of me, and still could not determine what I was observing after a two month lookout!  However, this is a very popular fad and these things are plentiful, easily available and cheap.  So expect more of them just about everywhere. The truth shall set you free.;41.2195589473685;-73.0573484210525
