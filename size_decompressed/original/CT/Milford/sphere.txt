It was huge and made no sound or reflection on the water below. My boyfriend and I were driving home and were driving along a street where there was a pond behind the houses. We saw an extremely bright, white sphere hovering over the water. We couldn't understand what is was, so we continued down the street to a point where there weren't any houses. We literally stopped the car in the middle of the road, and got out. This gigantic white sphere hovered at treetop level. It made no sound, and didn't make a reflection on the water. Then suddenly, the light was gone, and then it almost instantly reappeared much farther away over Gulf Beach (on Long Island Sound) We drove down to that beach parking lot where other people were out of their cars looking at the same thing. It began to slowly move NE along the coast line. Many of us got in our cars and followed it along the beach line to Woodmont. Then all at once, it was gone.  I don't normally believe in this stuff, but I will never forget the chill that gave me. I was in disbelief. My boyfriend and I never told anyone about that incident.

Orange and yellow round object transiting area at low altitude (no noise or tail) was spotted by 3 adults.;2012-06-06 21:15:00;5 minutes;Orange and yellow round object transiting area at low altitude (no noise or tail) was spotted by 3 adults. I was riding in the car as a passenger with my husband as we were on our way home from babysitting our grandchildren on Wednesday night, June 6, 2012 at around 9:15 PM.  We were heading west and we spotted an unusual object in the sky as it came in over the water just south of BDR (Sikorsky Airport). It was heading from the southwest to the northeast.  It looked like it came over Milford starting at the the Point Lookout area on Long Island Sound and was not travelling at any great speed.  It seemed to maintain level flight as it transited the area. My husband pulled the car over on New Haven Avenue near the intersection of Buckingham Ave. and we both got out to watch the object as it cruised directly above us and we were joined by another passerby who saw the object and pulled over, but we did not get his name. The object glowed orange and yellow, was round in shape and the light it cast was not a type of light I've ever seen before it was not bright like a landing light, but subdued and sort of pulsed yellow and orange.  There was no sound coming from it and there was no tail like you would see with a meteor or shooting star. It was pretty low too, when it finally disappeared into the clouds, they were scattered but looked between 2,000 and 3,000 feet. It’s hard to estimate size, especially at night, but I can only compare it to that of a full moon compared to the stars, but I am sure that was because it was not at any great altitude.  The siting lasted about 5 minutes until the object disappeared into a cloud. I was a Cessna Dealer back in the 1980’s and worked at Sikorsky Airport where my husband was an air traffic controller.  Though I am not a licensed pilot, my husband, a retired air traffic controller is, and we flew often.  I am familiar with what aircraft look like and sound like and this was no traditional craft. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone both with this witness, and her husband.  We found them to be exceptionally objective and eloquent, in describing their sighting.  We suspect that they are unusually good witnesses.  PD));41.2195589473685;-73.0573484210525
3 Spherical UFO's sighted over Long Island Sound, CT;2015-06-25 22:05:00;10 minutes;3 Spherical UFO's sighted over Long Island Sound, CT This is my first time filing a report Be warned. I was driving home from work at ~10:00 PM US Eastern time, and over Charles Island, there were 3 spherical balls of light that seemed to be behind the island.   These 3 balls were in an ascending order, the shortest to the left.  I mistook them for a ship's mast.  I saw the one on the far right, which was visible over the island, dim slightly and move right above the island at a 90 degree angle at a very fast speed.   The second two, the left and the middle, remained in place for a short time.  I then turned around my car and put my hazards on and pulled to the side of the road to get a good look.  The two on the left and middle had evened out at the middle's original altitude.   I stayed for a few minutes more but I didn't see any movement, to be honest I am expecting to see this on the news. - G;41.2195589473685;-73.0573484210525
