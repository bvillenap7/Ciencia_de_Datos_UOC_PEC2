Giant projector screen between two flashing, multicolored, lights. SEEN BY MANY.;2016-08-17 21:30:00;few hours?;Giant projector screen between two flashing, multicolored lights SEEN BY MANY. Went on a jog, I slowed down while passing Bay View Beach, to see two parallel moving lights, flashing different colors.  In the middle of lights was a giant 2D square, like a projector.  Witnesses told me that it had shifting messages, circles to squares to blank, etc.  Another family of people asked me what I thought it was.   Sister and friend say they saw it earlier in the day.  Up close underneath a storm of clouds.  Possible electromagnetic effect, IPhone 5 got put on airplane mode.
