huge triangular object moving at great speed and very low over my house in Milford CT;2008-07-15 02:45:00;1min;On Wednesday 7/15/08 early morning at around 2:45 am after having a smoke because I could not sleep I saw a huge triangular object moving at great speed and very low over my house in Milford CT. The object had a green hue and was flaming in the back and made no noise. Now I am not one of those who is going to say I just saw a space ship but I know it was some sort of craft and not a shooting star. The object was way to low and way to big to be a star or meteor. If this thing crashed into the earth there would have been big problems. Also my house is located under a commercial airline flight path with traffic from NY and Local Stratford Airport I lived here for 34 years and I have seen huge low flying jets but nothing like this. Also When I go to Vermont to visit family I like to watch the night sky for shooting stars and over the years I have seen hundreds but nothing this big or as close as it was. If anybody has seen anything like this or knows what I saw reply to this.

Three red lights flying in formation followed by a triangular craft with one red light that was spinning slolwy;2013-08-31 20:30:00;2 minutes;Three red lights flying in formation followed by a triangular craft with one red light that was spinning slolwy I was standing outside the Red Roof Inn, walking my dogs when something caught my eyes.  I saw three red lights flying in formation, and each light went out individually after about a minute, and none came back on.   This formation was soon followed by a triangular shaped craft with a red light in one corner.  The triangular shaped craft was slowly spinning, and remained visible until disappearing from my line of site.  All the ufo's appeared to be flying at a relatively low altitude.  No sound eminated from any of the Ufo's.;41.2195589473685;-73.0573484210525
