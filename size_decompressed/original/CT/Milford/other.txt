Strange craft over house, possible abduction;1980-05-10 13:00:00;3 hours;strange craft over house, possible abduction  500 Lights On Object0: Yes I was 15 years old, just got home from school. At approximately 3 pm.  I sat down in the den to watch some tv when I heard and “felt” a hum in my ear. At first I thought it was the tv, so I messed with it, it was not. Then for no reason, I got up and opened the door that lead out to the back porch. As soon I opened the door, the hum got twice as loud. Once again for no reason I looked up just over the back roof of the house. For a split second I saw a bronze craft hovering just over the roof top. Its hard to explain what it looked like as I only saw it for a fraction of a second. I remember it being somewhat long in the front and had some type of tail. The next thing I remember was the feeling of waking up after being knocked out. It took me a few moments to get my bearings, when I remembered I had seen something over the roof. I then looked back up to see what it was and saw the tail end flying over the front of the house. My heart was racing. I ran around ! to the front of the house, but all I saw was a strange looking rolling cloud configuration dissipating up into the sky, and then it was gone. I went back into the house, it was not approximately 6pm.;41.2195589473685;-73.0573484210525

There was a bright light that looked like a small flame at the base.  It appeared to almost be floating above the houses.  It was fairly low and vivid.;41.2195589473685;-73.0573484210525
