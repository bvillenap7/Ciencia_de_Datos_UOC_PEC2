Childhood experience in Milford, CT;1972-08-14 06:00:00;5 minutes;Childhood experience in Milford, CT This is the first time I have EVER mentioned this event. I was on the top bunk in my bedroom when I was awakened out of deep sleep. I then opened the curtain and looked out the bedroom window and saw what appeared to be a white/silver cylinder object hovering in the air. I was scared and facinated at the same time. I had always (and still have) a wild imagination, so I just lay in my bed and watched until it disappeared. I hopped out of bed right after the event ended and got a glass of water to make sure I was really awake. It happened when I was 8 years old (30 years ago) and this is the first time I ever said anything about it. What was odd to me was I expected to hear a news report or hear others discussing it. But that never happened. It was, and is, as if nothing occurred. I am a very logical thinker and not some nutcase. I am well-educated and have a family of my own now and have been very successful in life. That one event still haunts me, though. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Were we scanned by an orb or probe?;1999-04-19 02:00:00;1 min or less;Were we scanned by an orb or probe? After sleeping for a while, I woke first seeing something in the bedroom.  I awoke my wife who knows me for seeing things that aren't there said there is nothing there.  I urged her to take a look which she finally did and she was startled and closed her eyes thinking I am only dreaming.  She took a second look and freaked.  I fumbled for the light and turned it on and the object had dissapeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));41.2195589473685;-73.0573484210525
Pale circular object imoving in upper atmosphere split into three circular objects the same size;2010-03-16 22:00:00;3 seconds;Pale circular object imoving in upper atmosphere split into three circular objects the same size Just climbed in bed and was admiring the stars through the skylight when I saw a paleyellow small object in upper atmoshere moving across the sky at a moderate speed and then split into three pale yellow circular objects in a row  with the outer objects moving outwards.  At first thought it was a meteor but was too dull and circular and when it split into three all three were still the same size and circular.  Very strange, if it was a meteor it was like no other meteor I have ever seen.  I could only see it for a few seconds as they passed out of the viewing range of my skylight.;41.2195589473685;-73.0573484210525
Driving down the street thinking  did something just fall out of the sky?;2010-12-05 23:00:00;30 seconds;Driving down the street thinking  did something just fall out of the sky? I was driving down the street with my mom and I was looking out the window all of a sudden I saw something FALL out of the sky.  I was just thinking to myself  did something just fall out of the sky?. I gasped and my mom knew exactly why!  She asked me if I saw the same thing and I said yes!!  I was amazed and scared at the same time.  I felt like my stomach was miles behind us.  We haven't noticed anything strange and haven't heard anything else about it. We still wonder what it was.;41.2195589473685;-73.0573484210525

9 Orange Circles (Fireballs) seen traveling one group of 5 then 4 moving one at a time in same path;2012-10-13 20:30:00;9 minutes;9 Orange Circles (Fireballs) seen traveling one group of 5 then 4 moving one at a time in same path At about 2228hrs I heard a horn like noise. I looked out my window to see what was going on.  About South East from my location coming from Long Island sound over swamp land I saw five orange circle shape lights moving in the same direction in a direct line(top to bottom) moving in a North West trajectory.  The objects were moving very fast.  I ran outside to get a better look, the lights stayed in the same line keeping the same equal distance apart top to bottom however 2 of the lights appeared to slow down and were moving further apart side to side. The 2 lights that were moving further apart side to were lights 2 and 4 counting down.  Then the lights that were further ahead(1,3,&5) stopped in the air and waited lights 2 and 4 to catch up.  Then all the lights changed direction and headed NNE. Then four more orange cirlce lights came out however it was only one at a time following the same path as the previous five.  Once one left my view another came out. It should be noted that after I saw the group of 5 I ran to find video camera which was dead and could not be worked by plugging into a wall outlet.  Only had a charger for battery older camera.  I did video one orange light with my video on my cellphone which is near impossible to tell unless it can be blown up.;41.2195589473685;-73.0573484210525
Overflight of two firey orbs.;2012-10-21 19:06:00;7 minutes;Overflight of two firey orbs. ((NUFORC Note:  One of six sightings from same source, submitted over the course of two months.  PD))  Once more, please refer to the past Milford reports from this year for context on this sighting. Sunday, Gulf Beach, only a mild -3mph breeze from the NNW.  Intermittent high clouds.  Sunset about 6:40 PM. First:  7:06 PM.  Through windshield of parked car noticed a very bright low flying object approaching from the west (265 degrees), just above the treeline and shoreline houses.  Because of its familiar color, lack of blinking port/starboard/tail lights and peculiar gliding movement I immediately attempted to video record this aircraft.  Moving away from street/car lights to get a better view of it, and to project a 5 mW green laser at it, this object soon displayed itself as a typically flame-like oval.  It traveled from the west  into the SE, gaining altitude as it diagonally crossed the gulf.  The laser's 2,000 ft effective range did not appear to paint it, nor did it respond to the flash.  Within 2.5 minutes it blinked out in the SE sky.  Estimated speed = 45 mph. Second:  About 2 minutes after the disappearance of the first object another firey object suddenly popped up, either just between the trees exactly 270 degrees west - or possibly from the opposite beach itself!  This happened too rapidly for me to accurately judge its origination point.   As it moved towards me,  lower and more slowly than the previous UFO, I was able to aim the laser directly at it throughout its entire 2.5 minutes of travel in a trajectory similar to the previous UFO: upwards and into the SE sky.  No response, and nothing noticably reflected by the laser beam.  This object similarly blinked out about 120 degrees SE at 7:13 PM. Short MP4s recorded.;41.2195589473685;-73.0573484210525

UFO sighting in Milford, CT.;2017-08-14 08:45:00;1.33 minutes;UFO sighting in Milford, CT We were sitting on a bench in Silver Sand beach, when we noticed a light moving very slowly in the sky.  The light started to come closer to us and hovered about 50 feet in front of us.  I thought it was a drone, but it was too quiet and was moving very fast and erratic, with flashing white lights, in a pattern.  The craft then shot off towards Sikorsky.   Other onlookers noticed the craft and thought it was a plane as well, but as a plane past us, you could hear the engine this was no plane or drone.  We own a drone, and at that distance, can be heard.   Unless it was military grade, a drone canâ€™t fly at that great of distance we own one.;41.2195589473685;-73.0573484210525

Bright light morphed into craft over Milford Connecticut disappeared in thin air.;2020-06-28 21:03:00;10 seconds;Bright light morphed into craft over Milford Connecticut disappeared in thin air. My uncle and I were driving on Anderson ave in Milford CT when we saw what looked like a drone flying from west to East in front of us.  The light shrunk and it made a hard left turn and completely vanished in thin air.  I have a drone myself and none that I know of completely glow as a bright light, like this one did.  I took a video which only captures 3-5 seconds of the craft but when slowed down it is very apparent that it is high in the sky and was an illusion of it being only a couple hundred feet or so off the ground.  When going frame to frame it is clear it was moving very quickly.  It changes shapes from a light to a yellow blob and then finally a circle with a yellow ring and black in the middle.  My uncle and I both saw this with our own eyes.  We are constantly watching paranormal and UFO shows. I personally live in Las Vegas and am part of a UFO group with 20+ members who go out into the desert with equipment looking for these things.  This was just casual driving down the road.;41.2195589473685;-73.0573484210525
