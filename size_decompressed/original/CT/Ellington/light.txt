PD));2009-09-19 19:55:00;15 sec;Odd bright light in sky, with haze around it that seems to fade out. Almost looked like an explosion in the sky that faded out. First it looked like a flashlight was facing downwards but with dusty haze around it. Then it just seemed to start fading away. There are no clouds out tonight and I can see stars everywhere.

We had an aircraft visible to the south heading toward Bradly airport with its landing lights clearly visible.  The light we saw had no aircraft lights visible.  It was much larger and faster moving than satellites we see. Definitely something we've never seen before.;41.9114;-72.4626
30+ lights moving in formation moving across Ellington sky!;2020-04-11 22:00:00;5-10 minutes;30+ lights moving in formation moving across Ellington sky! At approximately 9:00 PM on 4/11/2020, we witnessed a line of over 30+ bright white lights moving in an east direction in a straight line, the lights all evenly-spaced and moving at the same slow speed.  We did not hear any noise coming from these objects. Due to Covid-19 quarantine, there were no planes flying and the sky was perfectly clear so these lights were highly visible (clearly not stars, shooting stars, etc.);41.9114;-72.4626
