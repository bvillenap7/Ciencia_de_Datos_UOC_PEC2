Near Pinney Street, saw an unidentified light source, about 1000 feet high, that seemed to have structure to it the lights seemed to be shining through something.   The object had 2 circular lights on top, a wide bright light below it, and a single light below that.  The object was not moving at all.  We watched it for about a minute, from about a mile away, until we were almost beneath it.   As we were attempting to identify it and were driving down the street, the lights slowly dimmed until they were out.  We then stopped the car, to see if we could hear a plane engine, but could not see or hear anything more.   A senior and a teenager witnessed this.;41.9114;-72.4626
