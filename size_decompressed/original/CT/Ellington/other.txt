Irregular Air Traffic - Identified;2015-10-05 11:40:00;5 minutes;Irregular Air Traffic - Identified I had just gotten to work and was outside with a co-worker having a smoke and admiring the clouds, bullshitting about the weather and the season when she noticed it first and asked what it was.  She thought it was a single craft but i was quick to notice it was 2 separate craft in a tight formation, to my surprise they were 2 Boeing B-1B Lancers.  The nearest bases are Barnes Air National Guard 103rd Fighter Wing (F-15s) and Westover Air reserve Base housing the 43rd Airlift wing.  If I recall correctly there are no B1 Wings on the East coast.  The Bombers were flying high at typical airliner height, with no after sound, heading from East to West.  This is not a UFO reporting but like my description just irregular air traffic;41.9114;-72.4626
2 aircraft with center orange lights, followed by 5 similar aircraft.;2015-12-25 20:30:00;10 minutes;2 aircraft with center orange lights, followed by 5 similar aircraft. Just got home from Christmas day with the grandkids, went outside to smoke a butt, when I saw two aircraft with orange lights just below the cloud deck.  No other Nav lights were visible, just a center orange light.   As they got close to flying over the house, the center lights were no longer visible.  My wife had just come outside and I was calling her over to look at these RQ-180 shaped craft flying eastward.  I could see their silhouette just below the clouds.   What was even more bizarre, they made no sound at all.  As I was calling my wife to come see the first two aircraft, she called my attention to 5 more orange lights flying from west to east in a relatively close formation.  The orange lights too extinguished as they approached the house.  Again, no sound what so ever.  I was in the Air Force and have seen many aircraft takeoff (F-4's, B-52's) but these aircraft can't sneak out of town.  F-4's are proof that if you put a big enough engine on an aircraft it can fly.  Westover AFB is to or north, and have seen F-15's and even Stealth fighters (at night) fly over, but again, these aircraft can't sneak out of town.   From the direction they were coming from it would have put them in the flight path of civilian aircraft from Bradley Airport.
