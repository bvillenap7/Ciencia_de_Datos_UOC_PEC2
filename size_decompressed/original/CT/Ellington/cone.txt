I managed to capture it by accident in a moving photo on my IPHONE while trying to photograph nature. I was surprised when I looked at the photo and continue to observe the movement of the object, hoping to explain it in some way besides an unidentified flying object. Maybe someone else could? I don't typically believe in such things so I'm really not sure what to make of it. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a possible lens flare.  We see many of them.  PD));41.9114;-72.4626
