Fireball seen in CT sky.;2014-01-12 17:10:00;5 seconds;Fireball seen in CT sky I was walking with me dog around 5:10 when something caught my eye. I looked up and saw a fireball fly across the sky.  I'm not sure how close it was, but it was close enough where I could see pieces and sparks fly off of it.  A tree branch obstructed my view as it continued through the sky, so I ran past the tree.  Even though this only took a few seconds, the fireball was gone.  There were no buildings or anything in the way to block my view after I got around that tree, so I'm not sure where it went.  From where I was, I could see sparks and what looked like smaller pieces come off of it so it must have been pretty close.  My dog's ears perked up, and she sniffed the air and pulled at the leash and jumped up.  I did not hear a noise with it, but she must have either been able to hear it or she saw it as well.;41.9114;-72.4626
