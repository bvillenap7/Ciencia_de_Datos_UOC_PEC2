Glowing sphere of light motionless for nearly an hour then vanished.;2018-08-01 21:00:00;2 hours;Glowing sphere of light motionless for nearly an hour then vanished. There was a glowing object somewhat low in the south/southwest sky that looked similar to Mars, only it was bigger than Mars or any other visible planet and it was not Mars (I found what was definitely Mars in another spot in the sky).  I did not move.  I used an app to figure out what celestial entity it might be, but nothing came up.  It was definitely not a plane it stayed in the same spot for at least 40 minutes or so before suddenly vanishing. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
