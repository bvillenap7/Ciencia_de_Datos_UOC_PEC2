I reacted quicly and step on the break so I don hit it.  Me and my friend was in shack mode for a few minuets. We turn arround to see where it went and there was nothing.  What ever we saw had wings and head.  It was very dark and when the object cross me it lighted up my entier dashboard and the front hood for a brife second. We did not have any drink or drug.  We drank coffee at night so we stay awake to play the casino  This was real. I will never go back there again as I am afraid that could be a warning from an angile.;41.4769;-71.9553
