I was Skywatching at Highland Lake with a friend of mine around 8:15PM.  I was still enroute to the lake when I got the sudden urge to speed up a little as if I was going to miss something.  We turned a corner to face the lake, when we saw a bright white light above the mountain line.  As I drove closer to the lake, it disappeared.  That was sighting #1.  Sighting #2 was a tiny flashing green and red object, above the mountain line at a different location.  That wasn't really anything too special.   The 3rd UFO almost looked like a blue star, however, it moved rather oddly.  It would go from one spot to another very very smoothly, and stop suddenly, yet smoothly.  When zoomed in, it looked like a flying saucer that was angled at an almost 90 degree angle, as you'll see in the pictures.  I was suggested to flash my high-beams in my vehicle, and when I did, the UFO moved very rapidly, although it was a short distance.  This happened multiple times when I flashed my lights.  Not once did it make any noise.  We observed this UFO for about an hour before we decided to leave.;41.9279;-73.0694000000002
