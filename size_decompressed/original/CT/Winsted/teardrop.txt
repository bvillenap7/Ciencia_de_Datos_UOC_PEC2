the speed  the contrail and the shape were nothing i ever seen before.and no sound;2007-04-20 01:30:00;1 minute;the speed  the contrail and the shape were nothing i ever seen before.and no sound me and my wife have been on vacation since sunday,april 15 and all it did was rain for a week, so this was our first day out of our prison.the day was perfect with just a few clouds in the sky and it must be 75 degrees .any ways we proceded to sun bathe in the driveway.the first craft i saw i realy didnt see,but what i did see was a single exhaust apear in front of my eyes ,very quilly and then it turned into a string of pearls or a loop---------loop--------and another loop and so on.i went inside and got my binocullars just in case .5 min later it appeared again .i have not ever seen anything go that fast,it made it from one herrisone to the next in a matter of 3 seconds.the craft seemed to be a tear drop shape and very reflective .again i could not believe the speed of this craft. thanks ((name and e-address deleted))  also there was no sound that i could here,i tried but didnt here nothing .;41.9279;-73.0694000000002
