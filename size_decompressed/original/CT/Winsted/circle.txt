Lighted circular objects moving silently across the sky;2008-08-15 23:00:00;hours;Lighted circular objects moving silently across the sky Noticed a strange light hovering across the lake where we live.  Looking through binoculars, there were several points of light that seemed to be pulsating around a circular object.  It looked kind of like a ferris wheel.  There seemed to be a few of these across the sky, and the lights were more green or orange than regular stars.  The main craft moved back and forth across the sky very quickly, without making any noise.  Sometimes it would leave for a few hours, only to return to the same point across the lake from our cottage.  The other objects also moved around the sky, but seemed farther away.  This happened three nights in a row. ((NUFORC Note:  Source indicates that date of event is approximate.  PD));41.9279;-73.0694000000002
