multiple  unidentifiable triangular flying objects.  ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  PD));2009-03-05 09:00:00;1 hr 30 min;Multiple  unidentifiable triangular flying objects MY brother and I were sitting up at Winchester Lake talking when we noticed a bright light about 100 feet above the tree line.  We watched it for about 40 minutes, within this time it has gone up and down, left and right, zig zag and while it was stationary it looked as though it was dropping things, then it  went up a couple hundred feet and disapeared.  We know that it wasn't an airplane because they don't move like that and we saw 2 airplanes while we were watching this thing.  Maybe 15 minutes after it disapeared a really bright light came out from above the trees.  It stayed there for about 30 seconds then started moving to the right, where it disapeared, reapeared, and disapeared over a field and in a flash it was gone.   Then, in 15 minute increments, 1 appeared and went to the left and disapeared, then another triangular with lights on each point came out of nowhere and went off to the right.  I felt really scared and i was kind of freaking out because i've never seen anything like this before in my life. ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  PD));41.9279;-73.0694000000002
