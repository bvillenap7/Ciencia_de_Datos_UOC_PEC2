Bright blue sphere traveling incredibly fast.;2008-02-11 22:30:00;5 seconds;Bright blue sphere traveling incredibly fast. I was traveling north bound on rt 8 with my fianc√©. The object was bright blue twice the size of the north star and twice as bright. The object was circular in shape also very smooth. We spotted it 1/4 - 1/2 of a mile north west of our present location. The object dropped down from the sky at around 500 ft. It then dropped at a 45 degree angle to about 300 ft it then followed a straight line at an incredible speed then abruptly disappeared before it went over the horizon.No sound was heard and no trail of light was left. The whole event lasted less than 5 seconds.;41.9279;-73.0694000000002
