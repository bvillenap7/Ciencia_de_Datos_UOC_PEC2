I went outside and saw that there was nobody around.  I quickly noticed 3 bright orange lights about 1,000 ft. up coming out of the north-west sky heading south-east, slower than an incoming aircraft about to land (we live in the flight path of Bradley International airport in Windsor Locks, Conn.)  The lights were set up in a triangular pattern on the front. I banged on the house to get my wife’s attention and she quickly came outside to join me and asked me what the problem was and I asked her to look up and tell me what it was that I was looking at.  She saw immediately what I was looking at and asked me what it was.  I said, You tell me, and she said, I don’t know?  She kept staring at it and soon she said, Oh my God, it’s round.  I agreed with her and we continued watching the UFO as it glided silently over us heading south-east.  It was as large as a 747 aircraft but round and had 3 orange lights and made no noise whatsoever. We watched for 10 minutes as it passed directly over us and as it passed, it was obvious that the lights were only in the front of the craft, no lights underneath or in the back, and no blinking lights either. Just after it passed over us, the lights began to disappear from sight similar to a car passing you on the road. 	My wife and I sincerely believe that we witnessed a UFO along with 2 other households (4 people – 3 adults and 1 teenager).;41.6853000000001;-72.9296000000001

Bright Orange And Red Orange Spherical Floating Lights;2012-04-13 20:30:00;1 hour+;Bright Orange And Red Orange Spherical Floating Lights A friend and I saw a large orange lighted sphere floating just over the trees, seemed to be lightly flickering, like a candle. It floated way up, silently and smoothly until it disappeared, about 20 minutes later we saw about 20 or more come from the hills and into the sky, a small group of people at the apartment building saw them as well and asked if we saw the same things. They continued for at least another half hour. They were all going into the same direction.;41.6853000000001;-72.9296000000001
Mysterious object more interesting than firework display...;2012-07-06 09:00:00;15 minutes;Mysterious object more interesting than firework display... We too saw the strange object during the firework display at Lake Compounce.  I was so intrigued that I was video-taping the strange object instead of the fireworks.  It sat still, moved in a sot of jumping motion, and quickly disappeared....  It seems like every year when I watch fireworks, I see something strange in the sky…;41.6853000000001;-72.9296000000001

At 8:30 pm on may 8th, 2014, I walked by my bedroom window and a large white light over the mountains caught my eye.  The mountains are located near lake compounce amusment park.  This area is not near the park and is covered in trees.  The white light looked like a sunset against the dark sky.  It stayed white for over five minutes.   I grabbed my camera to take a picture and then like a light switch the light turned a dark orange.  It stayed the same sunset shape slightly over the mountain.  The light never moved at all, just changed colors.  From my point of view it was the size of a sunset.  The light was very large others must have seen it.  I was afraid it was a forest fire...but the orange light didn't grow and I didn't see or smell smoke.  I didn't hear anything either although I was a few miles away.  The last I saw the light was 9:45 ish.   I went back to the window at 10:00pm and a fog rolled in and I couldn't see the top of the mountain.  My photo is dark I couldn't see the large round shape, however I lightened the photo and in the center of the light I saw a disk shape floating above the mountain! I didn't see a disk with my eyes... only in the photo.  It's not a plane because it did not more once.   I didn't hear any reports of fires in those woods.  There is no reason that I've found for that light.;41.6853000000001;-72.9296000000001
