Shape changing object.;2001-04-10 21:09:00;1:30 mins.;Shape changing object. Hi P, at a little after 21:oo hrs. tonite, my son (a mail man), and I saw a boomarang shaped ufo with no lights on it, black in color,no sound,about the size of a silver dollar at arms length.The incedible thing about it, and the reason I`m almost not reporting this is because it changed right in front of our eyes to a shape that resembled a snake slithering away. \/\/\/\/\/\/\/.Incredible I know but true.;41.6853000000001;-72.9296000000001
8 slow moving objects.   ((NUFORC Note:  Photo provided, but somewhat ambiguous, we believe.  PD));2018-06-30 11:00:00;40 minutes;8 slow moing objects. I saw a bright object in the western sky.  Then 3, then 5 and finally 8. they were enlongated tic tac shaped with a reddish end with a long cable hanging down.  They went in different directions. two turned south, three went north and the others just hovered slowley above my head for 40 min.  They changed shape from a bent tic tac to an hourglass on its side. they rotated slowly and faded and vanished. ((NUFORC Note:  Photo provided, but somewhat ambiguous, we believe.

Addendum to earlier report.;2018-06-30 11:15:00;maybe 25;addendum to earlier report 	On June 30, 2018, I saw what I thought was the sun glinting off of an airplane in the western sky around 11:15 AM. I witnessed three more pin hole spots which just hung in the sky ( as bright as venus). Eventually I saw a total of 5 with my naked eye and went in and got my dad who came outside and witnessed them as well.  They were moving slow and against the wind ( which the clouds were blowing SW ).  They split up and two went South, two went North and the rest glittered off and on until they faded.  At the time I thought they were drones.  I saw a jet fly right above one ( they were below clouds) and it slowly “ drifted “ to around 20 degrees off of pole center and faded in the cloud cover that was heading in.  During this I saw my neighbor over the fence and told him to look up, I grabbed my binoculars and went over to his house where the three of us observed a bent tic tac silver shape with a cable hanging from the bottom.  I got no pictures of it because I l! eft my phone on the table when I left, but we all observed it through binoculars (see attached drawing ).  I will ask them to file a report as well. The whole thing took over 25 minutes until we could no longer see anything due to that silvery cloud cover. I'm unsure as to what exactly these were, but I have never seen a craft like this. After adding a photoshop “FIND EDGES” filter to the images I can count 9 for sure but could only see 5 with my naked eye.
