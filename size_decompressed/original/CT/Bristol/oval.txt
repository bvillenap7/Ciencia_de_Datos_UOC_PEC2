It stopped moving for about 30 seconds then then began moving in in irregular patterns like the letter S, and did so for about  2 minutes at speeds faster then an aircraft. Then the object slowed down and proceeded to travel North till I lost sight of it over Wolcott Mt.;41.6853000000001;-72.9296000000001
