UFO over Bristol/Southington during firework display;2012-07-06 22:00:00;30 minutes;UFO over Bristol/Southington during firework display During yearly Fireworks display noticed a orange circular object above the lake...many people in the crowd also commented on it.  The object was stationary for about 15minutes and when the fireworks began going off, it moved toward the lake slowly....it appeared to have something &quothanging&quot off the bottom of it.... As the show continued, it slowly moved upward and disappeared in a matter of seconds.   There were numerous planes that flew over and it was obvious it was not a plane nor a star/satellite or planet..very strange experience;41.6853000000001;-72.9296000000001
Drone like craft.;2012-08-15 22:30:00;1 minute;Drone like craft. I do not know what it was that I saw, it was very close to me, about 100ft away and at the tree line.  It was late at night and I stepped out onto my 2nd floor deck that is outside of my bedroom to have a cigarette.   I looked to my left and I saw some sort of craft flying just above the tree line..but the thing is, the craft was small I thought it might be some kind of drone or something.  It was black and  emitted a red beam.  the best way I can describe the shape is that it looked like the mother ship on the movie independence day.  And the object was silent.   I have seen other things before at other times, and experienced missing time before with a group of about 25 other people. ..This was a long time ago.  But I have occasionally seen strange things since then.;41.6853000000001;-72.9296000000001
Orange lights in the sky;2013-08-30 21:15:00;15 minutes;Around 21:15 received call about orange lights in the sky.  Looked out as i just pulled in my driveway and noticed 5-6 orange lights travelling from SW to NE.  These lights were below cloud level and moving in uniform.   No sound.  No beacon lights flashing.  There was at least 1 plane in the sky flying from E to W ahead of these orange balls.   The caller who contacted me, along with 2 others reported they saw at least 10 more of these orange lights before they called me.;41.6853000000001;-72.9296000000001
