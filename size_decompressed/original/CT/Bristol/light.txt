They were red lights in formation all traveling at the same speed.;2016-11-19 18:22:00;30 seconds;They were red lights in formation all traveling at the same speed. At first I thought they we're an airplane but there was too many of them and too close together. There were no blinking lights they stayed all read they moved from the south east towards would've been the Hartford skyline.  And they just disappeared.  The initial group were followed by two more traveling which appeared to be the same speed and disappeared in the same location.;41.6853000000001;-72.9296000000001
Circling light in sky over Bristol's Rockwell Park;2017-08-25 22:00:00;~1 hour;Circling light in sky over Bristol's Rockwell Park Light in the sky moved in a tight consistent circle, avoiding leaving cloud cover.  When it had no choice, it seemed to disappear.  Camera phone glitched out taking picture of star and child chalk drawing, and bright white light flashed, turning red.  No shaft of life (as per a spotlight) could be seen.   A friend and I pursued it , and noted the circular pattern was consistent. Always making the rotation in the same time (slower for slow rotations, faster for large).  4 crafts, like from Bradly AFB seemed to be monitoring.;41.6853000000001;-72.9296000000001

Lights moving across the night sky and disappearing, all at the same place.;2017-09-29 22:45:00;15;Lights moving across the night sky and disappearing, all at the same place. My brother and I were on our way home from a movie.  Just as he dropped me off at my place, we noticed these big orange lights moving across the sky.  They would appear in the southeast, headed west, and then disappear as they reached certain point.  There were about 4 or 5 at a time in view, and they were absolutely silent - no noise at all.   My mother, who was inside the house with my father, came out and watched them with us, until they stopped appearing.   I didn't count them, but there were quite a few - they all came from about the same place, they all disappeared at the same place.  They were pretty, but the silence was so strange - eerie, really.  My brother thought they were balloons with candles or lights in them.  I disagree.  They were too high, and really far away.  I'm sure there is probably a perfectly reasonable explanation for what we saw - I'll read about some weird night balloon festival happening in the next town over, or something similar.  But for now! , I'm going with UFOs.  (Much more fun that way, I think!);41.6853000000001;-72.9296000000001

It was incredible;41.6853000000001;-72.9296000000001

It’s moving erratically, as if searching for something (up, down, left, and right).  Short periods of remaining still.  Nothing on the air radar.  Still active now.;41.6853000000001;-72.9296000000001
Potentially Huge UFO with 6 sets of a total 18 lights appears & takes off!;2021-03-16 06:11:00;15 seconds;Potentially Huge UFO with 6 sets of a total 18 lights appears & takes off! I was standing near the sidewalk across the street from Bristol Home Depot. East was at my 12 position. The event was around 1030. With 6pm behind me facing West. Now I looked up to 1030 position in the sky. To see a perfect line of lights. 6 main sets. With 3 in each. Sorta like the S in morse code. I noticed it for 15 seconds & they either went up out of view of went off out of view. It was too big to be one craft. I don't believe in UFO stuff. But this is very unusual.*I'm sure others seen it. I had no time to sign into cellphone & take photos.;41.6853000000001;-72.9296000000001
