Brilliantly lit flat object of large size seemingly falling from space at sunrise;2021-01-24 07:10:00;2 minutes;Brilliantly lit flat object of large size seemingly falling from space at sunrise Craft looked to be falling with brilliant streaks from all sides. Object appeared flat in the picture I took. Did not make the standard fireball effect of a meteorite. Looked more like something on reentry from space.It was just before full sunrise and was brightly lit up against the lighting of the sun rising to the east over the horizon beyond it. Had substantial size based on the size in the sky compared with the huge satellite dishes of our company in the foreground. No noise was distinguishable during the occurrence. I spotted it and called to fellow officers to look and the three of us all witnessed it. It disappeared behind the tree line over the horizon to the east.;41.6853000000001;-72.9296000000001
