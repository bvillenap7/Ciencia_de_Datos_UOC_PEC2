Two kidney bean shaped objects witnessed by 4 in Bristol, CT.;2018-06-30 14:00:00;30 minutes;Two kidney bean shaped objects witnessed by 4 in Bristol CT. On Saturday, 06/30/18, around 14:00 Eastern standard, I parked my car and got out to have my neighbor and his father tell me to look up at the sky.  I looked up and observed two objects to the NW.  My guess at altitude would be well over 30,000 feet.  The reason I say that is that a commercial airliner passed below the objects while at cruise altitude.  Both objects we're moving independently of each other.  One would be climbing rapidly as the other held altitude, or one would move west as the other East.  The objects we're silver in color but not reflective.  They we're sort of kidney bean shaped with something like a hose or pipe extending straight down.  My wife and I watched them for about 30 minutes untill one climbed above a cloud and the other moved to the west and we lost sight.  My neighbor said that there were 4 before I got home, but I only witnessed 2.;41.6853000000001;-72.9296000000001
