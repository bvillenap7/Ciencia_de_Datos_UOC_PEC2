Five orange circular objects were seen in Bristol August 18, 2013 at 20:06.;2013-08-18 20:06:00;5 minutes;Five orange circular objects were seen in Bristol August 18, 2013 at 20:06 We saw two orange/circular objects in the sky.  They had a soft amber glow.  We drove a few seconds more when we saw three more that had been blocked from our view by the trees along the street.  They were low in the sky, and definitely not airplanes, and had no detectable sound.   We reported this to Channel 30 and asked if anyone else had reported these.  But they did not get back to us.;41.6853000000001;-72.9296000000001
