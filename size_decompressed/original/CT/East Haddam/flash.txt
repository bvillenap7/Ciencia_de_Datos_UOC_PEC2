UFO Sighting;2019-12-04 15:00:00;Seconds;UFO Sighting I was driving around 3pm and saw it in the sky a huge circle/ flash in the sky then it was gone.  It lasted maybe 2 seconds.  Very, very white and big object with flash.  The passenger was with me and we both didnâ€™t know what it was.  No other explanations or anything in the sky on a clear day that would suggest it could have been something else.  We same to the conclusion that we saw a ufo.;41.4713;-72.4082
