It appeared to be illuminated white with a light pastel green tint to it.  The object left no trail of any sort nor could I hear sound.  The size can only be speculated as visually it was approximately 25% of the size of the visual moon at this given time of day, which was fairly large.   Could not determine distance, but appeared to be well w/in our atmosphere as it shot across sky on a straight line. I knew immediately that I had seen some sort of UFO, whose origin is the question…. Admittedly a lifelong believer but never a witness until now.   It could be “ours” but doubt it.  The intent of the E.T.’s is probably the question we might not want the answer to.;41.4713;-72.4082
