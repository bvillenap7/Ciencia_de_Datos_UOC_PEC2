We have emailed the AVI file of the event. To be honest, we are not sure this is genuinely unidentifiable. It could be some kind of reflection on the camera lens, but we haven't seen anything like this before and the image seems to have dimensionality to it.;41.4713;-72.4082

The lights were moving very slowly right to left, observed for about 30 seconds or less and then slowly faded out. The lights moved in unison together, no movement among themselves. Sky was clear and dark. No blinking was observed.;41.4713;-72.4082
