Flat, round object heading rapidly SE horizontally.;1997-01-08 17:20:00;2 seconds;SUMMARY:  Flat, round object heading rapidly SE horizontally. I was on my way home from work on roads I've travelled at this time of day for the past 35 years. Suddenly this object appeared coming from behind me above tree level heading in a SE direction relatively horizontal. It was very clear and bright (a whitish sort of metallic light). There was no haze or bluriness at all. The object was circular with very clear edges. It appeared to have either a raised middle section or a lighted area around the center. It was travelling at tremendous speed and was out of sight in just a couple of seconds. At first I thought it was a reflection but there are no street lights in the area and it was going too fast. It definitely was not an airplane nor a shooting star. It was too sharp and clear for a shooting star and too round for an airplane. Besides, it was going too fast for a plane, even a jet. I have worked at the University of Connecticut since 1961 and have never seen anything like this on any of the roads I travel to get to and from wor!k which is 28 miles from home. I have seen another strange sighting at home in Moosup, CT 06354. I was outside one night with my dog. While she was doing her business, I was looking at the stars. Suddenly a light appeared just like a light bulb had been turned on and darted across the sky. It was quite a while ago, maybe a couple of years, so I don't remember exactly which way it was going after it lit up. I think it went from NW to SE at a rapid rate and was out of sight in just a few seconds, probably five or six.;41.7778;-71.9502
