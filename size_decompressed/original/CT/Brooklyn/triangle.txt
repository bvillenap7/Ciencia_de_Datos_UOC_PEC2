3-5 bright lights, sporatically flashing and forming a triangular shape;2003-02-16 00:05:00;10-15 minutes;3-5 bright lights, sporatically flashing and forming a triangular shape My friend and myself were camping, and from about midnight to quarter past, we witnessed up to five very bright lights in the Northeast sky. It seemed that three remainined mostly on, forming the three points of a triangle, and several more lights within the triangle pattern blinked on and off in a strobe like fashion. The lights within the triangular area flashed sporatically and no apparent pattern could be established. It was a moonlit night and although many commercial aircraft had passed over us earlier in the evening, none were noticed at this time. The object(s), to my best estimate was 10-20 miles away and travelling in a northeasterly direction. It seemed that the further it went, the fewer lights were visible. The flashing lights were fairly intense and if they were from a normal aircraft, I would expect the aircraft to be much closer to us. There was no noise from the craft. I called the local state police barracks the following morning, but there had been no reports. The officer said that a helicopter had come in to an accident scene, but he didn't give me specifics as to when or where. I feel confident that this was not any sort of conventional aircraft, a formation of military aircraft, nor any celestial objects. Both my friend and myself are believers in extraterrestrial life, and are also well eductated professionals. This is the first time that we've witnessed anything like this. We are open to any explanation, but hope that;41.7778;-71.9502
