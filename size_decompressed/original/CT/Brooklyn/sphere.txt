Yet another UFO spotted by my house;2004-09-01 03:00:00;10 minutes;Yet another UFO spotted by my house I live right by a farm and the sky was pretty clear it was around 3:20AM and I was having trouble sleeping I had seen UFO's at least two times before. This time the object was much like the last one I saw a couple of weeks ago. It was staying still for about five to eight minutes and was very bright. The object was only one color light yellow almost white. After remaining still for awhile it began to move very slwly in a circular motion eventually becoming very bright actually affecting the way the sky looked. It then shot off which looked like it either went out to space or traveled to a different dimension or something. This is twice I have seen this sphere like light this summer and several summers ago I witnessed two UFO's different to this one with my whole family. I just found your site today and that is why I am writing this. I have a feeling after seeing two on the same night with each other years ago and now two this summer on seperate occasions that my house might be a hot spot for UFO activity and I will try staying up more often to try and get a picture or video to send. I also have a strong feeling inside that more and more UFO's will be showing up all over the world and that more should be put into investigating what these are, what they are doing, and why they are here. I will be visiting your site more often and will be telling everyone I know that is interested in this subject to check out your site. Thanks.;41.7778;-71.9502
