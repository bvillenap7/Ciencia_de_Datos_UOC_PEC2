Three bright blinking white lights were seen flying in formation, circling near the horizon.;2001-08-01 22:30:00;30 seconds;Three bright blinking white lights were seen flying in formation, circling near the horizon. Three circular super-bright white lights were seen in a triangular formation flying low along the horizon.  Despite their low altitude, no sound was heard.  They were also moving very fast.  They circled the area before disappearing behind trees.  Their white lights were blinking, each with its own frequency that differed slightly from the other two.  When compared to a plane, these three white lights were reported as being much much brighter and moving much faster.  They were also following a path that was not similar to the usual flight pattern of airplanes in the area.  The observer is usually a UFO skeptic who would rather not dwell on the subject, but he was slightly riled up and excited by this sighting.  He repeatedly made the comment that that definitely was not an airplane and also said, I know that was not a weather balloon.  It was clear from that reference that he was rethinking his thoughts on UFO's and aliens.  He also said that he had felt like he was being drawn outside to look for the lights after he lost sight of them.  Having known the observer for many years, I was surprised by his level of intrigue and fascination.  I would say that he might now be a believer, even though he has always been one of the more skeptical people I know.  The observer and I went out the next night at the same time and in the same location, a rural neighborhood, to watch for any strange lights, but none were seen.;41.8409;-72.8978
