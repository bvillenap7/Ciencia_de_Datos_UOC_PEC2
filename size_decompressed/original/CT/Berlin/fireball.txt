PD));2009-01-01 19:00:00;1 hour;This is the 2nd night the object or craft has been seen.  It is a few miles away houvering in the sky.  The other night it definitely went down slowly.  It was also a few miles away. Tonight 01/01/09 it is just overhead and shines very, very brightly (almost like bright headlights) I called it into the hotline.  Thank you.

Two fireball-looking objects flying side-by-side in a south-western direction.  One of the fireballs emitted what appeared to be droplets of fire from my vantage point.  The balls were not connected to each other as they weaved in an out, relative to each other. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
