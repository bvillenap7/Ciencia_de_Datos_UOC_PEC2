Round white light moving at animatedly fast rates.  ((anonymous report));1980-06-18 22:00:00;20 seconds;Round white light moving at animatedly fast rates. while parked at Silver Lake in Berlin, CT, I viewed a blinking light appear approximately a half mile awaw.  While blinking at a rate of one blink every 2 seconds, it covered half the distance twice, before halting about 1000 feet over my car.   It then blinked 3 times and then went solid white.  From this perspective, it propelled at a lighted blur to an upward point unknown and left a blurred light path in its wake.  It took 3 seconds for it to escape sight, and did not return ((NUFORC Note:  Source of the report provides no contact information.  PD));41.6187;-72.75

PD))((anonymous report));2017-03-19 23:50:00;For the past 6 months;White light it seems very close My house is facing Silver Lake in Berlin for the past 6 months I'm seeing a light in the sky is steady it can be like that for days or few hours and it just goes away I'm just wondering if anyone else had a experience of this.  One of the examples this was bothering me for hours so I decided to show my husband by the time I dragged him to see it the light was no where to see it for long time he was telling me it's a star till I proved him wrong that all the other stars are there where is the closest light that we saw.  This goes on for days sometimes it's not there at all ((NUFORC Note:  Source of the report elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));41.6187;-72.75
