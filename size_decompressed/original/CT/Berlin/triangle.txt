Two orange lights swirled around eachother and flew off side by side to the north northeast.;2006-12-24 17:30:00;3 min.;Two orange lights swirled around eachother and flew off side by side to the north northeast. Two orange lights about the size and color of the head of a cigarette slowly floated in from the southeast.They flew side by side and when they were almost overhead they began to swirl around each other. This is when I began to think they weren't ordinary aircraft. At this point they'er moves became even more eratic, but only very briefly. The two then lined up side by side again and started off in a north, northeast,direction.                                                                    This all happened as my mom and I were picking up my father for a christmas eve gathering. As they began to swirl overhead I asked my mom to look and called the neighbor on my cell phone.My mom witnessed the the two lights, but they were gone before the neighbor was able to get outside.;41.6187;-72.75
bright light in the sky;2007-02-24 21:00:00;2 min;My son and I were returning home from the Showcase Cinema in Berlin heading south towards Meriden when we noticed a bright light in the sky.  At first we thought it was a helicopter with a spot light but as we got closer it appeared to have what looked like three extremely bright headlights.  It was flying at a slow speed as we got closer and were directly under it we could see it actually had two additional bright lights on its belly.  All five lights were round, the same color and were steadily lit.  The aircraft was black and triangular.  It was a clear night. We didn't hear any sound come from the aircraft but of course our windows were up.  The reason I’m reporting this is because I’ve seen planes fly by in the nighttime sky and they usually have green and red blinking lights.  This aircraft did not.  It seemed to be moving Northeast.   We were so amazed that I pulled into a parking lot, but when we looked back it had disappeared.  How can an aircraft with such bright lights and flying at such a low altitude disappear so suddenly?   I mentioned this incident to a friend and he said that they were probably landing lights, but there are no airports in the area.
