light seperated into four parts and flew away at right angles;1980-06-01 20:00:00;10 seconds;light seperated into four parts and flew away at right angles I was looking out the car window and saw what I thought was a planet. There were no other stars or lights in the sky. I could not tell how far away it was. All of a sudden it seperated into 4 equal size pieces and each flew at perfect right angles and in perfect synchronized time to the four horizons and disappeared. Then there was nothing. It lasted about 5 seconds. The speed was unbelievably fast. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));41.3813;-73.4034999999999
