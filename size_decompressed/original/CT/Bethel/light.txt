White, green and red lighted object in Western Sky;2007-08-11 23:45:00;1 hour;White, green and red lighted object in Western Sky White, green, and red lighted object in Western Sky.  We were outside getting ready to watch the meteor showers and my mother noticed something with lights that was just standing still.  It was up a ways in the sky, and at first she thought it was a satellite, but it wasn’t moving and it was far to clearly visible to be a satellite.  We grabbed our binoculars and noticed that it had 3 colors to it, and the lights were flashing and changing positions.  It began moving after about 25 – 30 minutes of watching it and it moved very slowly just beyond the mountain top.  We got into our car and made our way to shelter rock school in Danbury and watched it for about 10 – 15 minutes and again it moved.  We then went to Lee farm Park in Danbury and watched it for just a few minutes but then it was really to far away to really see anything.;41.3813;-73.4034999999999

Then they stopped and split apart on a line. I lost track of one of them and the other stopped and just looked any star in the night sky. thats it!
