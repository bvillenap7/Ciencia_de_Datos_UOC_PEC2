Silver round object hoovering in the sky during daytime.;2015-06-29 16:00:00;5 minutes;Silver round object hoovering in the sky during daytime. I was driving home and noticed a silver object in the sky.  At first I thought it was a blimp but I have been on blimps and this shape was round. I turned up the hill and kept thinking about how it was not a blimp.   I turned around to get a picture but had to go down the hill and pull into a parking lot.  I saw an employee come out and said  look up there and tell me what you see.  It had disappeared. The next day I told a coworker and he said the blimp went by but that was at 10am not 4pm.  I asked if it had Snoopy on it and he said Yes.  No Snoopy here I saw all silver.;41.3813;-73.4034999999999
