We could not help noticing a very large egg shaped ring of steady yellow lights at tree top height, that was assending very slowly to the southwest.  It continued in a steady course for 2 ot 3 min's, maybe more as we watched.  It was absolutly silent.  No sound whatsoever!  It continued it's course until it was almost out of seight.  Whatever was in the center of the ring could not be seen.  We figured it was a lighter then air craft...but there were no sound of engines.  Maybe a ballon...but I don't believe they are allowed to fly at night and the shape was not cosistent with a ballon.  So to this day we don't know what the heck it was.  I would like to know if anyone, anywhere has observed anything like this, or if anyone may know what it could have been?  My wife, daughter and myself have only a passing interest in UFO's. We neither hunt them or venture an oppinion about ET's.  But after this encounter, we sure would like to know what the heck that thing was. Once you see something it is a huanting experience.  I only wish I had a flash camera.  It was so close I don't see how I could not have gotten a very good picture. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));41.3813;-73.4034999999999

We stopped for a picnic, and saw some craft flying by. They were silent and egg-shaped. They were copper in color, and were about 50 feet long at about 300 feet above the ground. They whisked by and we did not see them again.;41.3813;-73.4034999999999
