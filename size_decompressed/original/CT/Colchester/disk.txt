I was driving in my familyâ€™s car with my mother down a back road.  Suddenly I saw a flash of light behind us.  I turned my head to look out my window and I saw a disk shaped object, titled on its side, zoom past us and dart into the clouds above. The disk acted as though it were a prism (it was the colors of all the colors of the rainbow)!  The object left a momentary trail of the rainbow light behind on the path it took into the clouds. The object had very little effect on out vehicle the only effect was some brief static on the car radio as it zoomed by us. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));41.5695;-72.344
