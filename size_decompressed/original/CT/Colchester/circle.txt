I can tell you what it did.  It moved fast from left to right very, very fast, and stopped in one place for about four second and took off?;41.5695;-72.344
2 lights, circular aircraft seen by many in Colchester,CT;2019-11-05 19:39:00;2 minutes;2 lights, circular aircraft seen by many in Colchester,CT Flying slow and low to the ground - at first appeared to be 2 glowing stars.  Abnormally large and upon getting closer proved these lights were on the end or a large round  aircraft of the likes Iâ€™ve never seen.  Large enough to be mid plane size, not a drone.  From underneath due to lighting the shape was illuminated with a few colored lights at the bottom.  The engine was quite loud and had not others including my child seen in, I would have believed I was hallucinating.;41.5695;-72.344
