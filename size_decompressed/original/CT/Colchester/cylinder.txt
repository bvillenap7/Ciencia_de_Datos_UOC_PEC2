I had just bought a camera, and the night sky seemed extremely pretty so i thought I'd take a picture of it. A couple of weeks passed and when i developed the film, I didn't notice anything at first. But when I looked at it some other time, in the bottom left hand corner of the photograph, a cylinder shaped object There is a light underneath the object and the light helps make out the image or body line of the object. I know for a fact that this wasn't a plane because I remember there being no planes in the area, and there were no light or anything else on outside my house or in the area.;41.5695;-72.344
