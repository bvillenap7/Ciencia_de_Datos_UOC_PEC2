8 large bright orange fire balls with no sound following the same path one after another.;2013-07-20 23:00:00;10 minutes;8 large bright orange fire balls with no sound following the same path one after another My husband and I were sitting outside when we noticed what looked like a large very bright orange fire ball which had no sound.  It was at a low altitude.   It came across the sky and made a turn to the south.   About  30 seconds later a second  large very bright orange fire ball came across the sky and also made a turn to the south.   It seemed that approximately  every 30 seconds a large very bright orange fire ball came across the sky and followed the exact path of the others.  There were 8 in total.   We did not have a camera with us to take pictures, I wished we did.   The sight was phenomenal  to watch.  There was no sound with any of the large very bright orange fire balls.;41.674;-73.0075
