Bright beam of light omitted from cylinder.;2009-09-20 21:00:00;20 seonds;Bright beam of light omitted from cylinder. There was nothing in the sky as far as a craft or flying object that was visible. Something from past the stars looked like a huge flashlight beam coming down a long cylinder and flare out towards the bottom of the light. As we looked at it in aww the light sucked back up the atmosphere beyond stars. No clouds in the sky at all very clear bright night. As the beam went up the flare got thinner like it too was fitting back into the cylinder shape as it went up and disappeared. The beam of bright light that was higher up was very bright and defined contained beam however at the bottom where it flared outwards it didnt seem like earthy light/flash light type beam that flares out it seemed to be a more fluffy,foggey. Its hard to discribe. I can say whatever it was omitting that beam of light was not visble and the light even as big and wide as it appeared past the stars.;41.3869;-72.8604
