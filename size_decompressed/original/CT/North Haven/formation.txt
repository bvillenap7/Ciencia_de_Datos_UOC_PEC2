12 amber lights in formation.;2018-04-10 20:30:00;5 minutes;12 amber lights in formation. On my way to work I witnessed 12 lights in formation.  They hovered for roughly 5 minutes. A few other cars pulled to side to witness the event.  As we were watching, all 12 lights went off almost simultaneously.  Iâ€™m not one to report events such as these but this is the second time I have witnessed this formation at this exact location on Rte 22 along All Saints cemetery in North Haven, Ct.   The last time I witnessed this event was Labor Day 2017 around 2130hrs.  Same thing, amber lights in formation.  I watched for a couple of minutes and then all lights went out.;41.3869;-72.8604
