They were over route 5 in north haven.   I drove directly under 3 of them no more then a few 100 feet high and they were just hovering in formation glowing extremely bright as if on fire.   Some never moved while a few of the lights flew around and appeared to interact with eachother in pairs doing circles around eachother at very slow speeds.   They were definitely not airplanes or helicopters because there was no sound and the light was a color and brightness like I never saw on an aircraft.   I circled the block after watching for about 10 minutes to go get a closer look and they were gone.   I pointed them out to others who saw it too, it even brought local traffic to a crawl as people looked up.  I never reported something like this before and I'm not sure what I saw but I can confidently saw it was not an aircraft I know of.;41.3869;-72.8604
8 circular star like objects coasting throughout a 45 min period 6 in one direction 2 the opposite;2014-05-01 21:45:00;40 minutes;8 circular star like objects coasting throughout a 45 min period 6 in one direction 2 the opposite. Tiny circular lights that replicate stars, coasting across the sky appearing as a small meteor shower but were no reports of one for tonight.   These are very hard to spot but possible to see with out a telescope or any other magnifying device and once they're spotted coasting it seems they would collide with the other stars but never do.   If you just look up at the stars like any ordinary day you may be surprised how quickly you'll notice these.  Again, tonight i saw eight tiny circular lights coasting through out the sky, six went in one direction and two went the opposite through out a forty five minute period.;41.3869;-72.8604
