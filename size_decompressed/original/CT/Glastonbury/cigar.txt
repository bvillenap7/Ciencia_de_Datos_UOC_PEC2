Silver cigar shape in the air;2008-03-20 13:00:00;13:00-13:05;Silver cigar shape in the air I am a 15 year old kid.  I saw an unidentified flying object overhead while me and my mom were driving from the mall in Connecticut. I was looking up at the clouds when i saw something up in the east side of me.  I looked like a cigar shaped thing up in the sky.  It was silvery or metalic.  I was pretty low to the ground and kind of far away.  At first i thought it was one of those advertisment ballons but it had no thing on it. It stood there for a while with gleaming glow coming off it. This is the wierd part.  When we pased under a bridge the thing disapered.  I looked all around for it and it wasn't there.  No normal craft could disaper in one second.  I took out my phone to take a picture but it was to late.  It was already gone.  I was mad. I definitly think it was a ufo.;41.7066;-72.5745
