I was getting on Rte. 2, headed towards East Hartford, from Rte. 3.  I looked to my right, and saw something falling in the sky.  It appeared to be an asteroid or falling object.  It had a rather large tail behind it.  It was a bluish-greenish light, quite bright.  It fell very quickly I saw it for approximately 2 seconds.   Suddenly, it came to a dead stop in the sky, while simultaneously turning red, as if it were a brake light. The red light appeared to be rather large and oval in shape.  This happened over a fraction of a second, then the object completely disappeared. I am curious to know what it could have been.;41.7066;-72.5745
