I was heading north north east, so I was looking in the direction of Rhodes Island. As I looked into the sky I saw a rather large light and tried to make some sense of this and then it just took off north towards Massachusetts. I thought it was stationary at first. Nothing can move as fast as this except a fireball! I didn’t expect it to move and then it was gone. It was not way out in space, it’s very hard to say how far it was but 2-10 miles maybe. It was round and the size of a light bulb. Nothing like the size of a star or planet or anything like that. This was close and it did not have any like light rays glistening from it like must light objects do. The speed when it took off was what made me realize this was something unusual. I know how fast a fireball travels because I saw one last year. It streaked across the sky coming Massachusetts and exploded in a bright flash over Rhode Island.
