Unexplained Noise and Energy Reported Across Town;2020-09-06 04:00:00;10 minutes;Unexplained Noise and Energy Reported Across Town I was awake at 4am trying to get to sleep. Suddenly I heard an extremely loud noise that sounded like it was coming from all directions. The only way I can describe it is a whirring sound, like something going in a circular motion. I’d say it’s like an old washing machine but the noise didn’t sound crisp, it was dull.  The noise was accompanied by a strange feeling in the air, almost electric. I quickly got a bad migraine I get them when there are drops in barometric pressure so I’m not sure if that was the case or the noise was so loud it caused one. The noise then abruptly left, and it sounded like it suddenly started down the road with the same whirring. Sometimes it would cut out and in again. Sometimes it would reappear near my house then move again. After about 10 minutes it stopped.  I thought I was the only one that heard it but then the town Facebook page exploded with reports of the same noise. Another person said it felt like the noise “vibrated her body”. More reported waking from a dead sleep to the noise and that it was like a bass tone because of the depth and feeling. The reports came mostly from the northern and central part of the town, but a few reported hearing it in the south, east, and west.  I saw a UFO once before, with my mom about 7 years ago. We were both skeptics, but our experience made us both believers. When this recent incident occurred I didn’t immediately think of a UFO, but when I felt the energy I could sense this was something not normal. I’m an academic with a MA working in a field that is very no-nonsense. I want to find an explanation for everything, but I can’t find one for this.;41.7066;-72.5745
