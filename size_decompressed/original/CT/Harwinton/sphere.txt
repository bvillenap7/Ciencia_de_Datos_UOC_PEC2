Glowing spherical object appeared to be a plane with glare from setting sun but as we kept looking did not act like a plane.  Was moving northerly in a straight line and after 10 seconds turned 90 degrees to move straight west.  We watched as long as we could - did not see further deviation.;41.7681;-73.0665
