Was seen while driving down Rt. 4 towards Litchfield, from Burlington.  Very, very bright light that looked like it was falling to earth.  Once we got closer, it stopped and hovered.  We noticed 2 small lights on either side that were also very bright.  All were white. Looked to be an oval/saucer shape.  It then went in the opposite direction in a way that a plane simply could not maneuver.  Was too large to be a drone and was not the shape of a helicopter.  After we dropped off a friend and went back the same way we had come, it was nowhere to be found.;41.7681;-73.0665
