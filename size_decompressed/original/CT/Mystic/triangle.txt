When i was standing outside my job at a hotel in mystic, ct a coworker and i were outside smoking cigarettes, and we looked up into the sky where we saw a hovering light, as we watched the light, it started to move upward, straight up, we did nothing but watch as this light raised up high, then it started moving towards us, as it was moving the light patterns changed, several times they changed, then once it was right above us, the lights changed into a six dot pyramid, during this whole event, there was no sound at all, after that it just flew away.;41.3645;-71.9722
Triangular orange lights hovering over Mystic, CT.;2012-10-26 17:35:00;10 minutes;Triangular orange lights hovering over Mystic, CT On the night of October 26, 2012, my wife & I were returning from shopping when we observed 3 triangularly shaped lights hovering over the Mystic River in Mystic, CT.   As we continued to watch these slow-moving lights for roughly 10 min, they seemed to converge, until they finally disappeared in the cloud cover.  Then, my wife saw a static red light appear (following the disappearance), which remained for about 30 sec before disappearing once again.;41.3645;-71.9722
