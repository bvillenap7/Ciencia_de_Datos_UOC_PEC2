One night between March and May 2012, two friends and I were exploring our town called Burlington, Connecticut.  It was a clear night and pretty much a normal night until this event happened.  All of a sudden we pull onto a dead end (no outlet) road and saw something bizarre. There were about one hundred deer in the last yard on the left.  The man or woman in the house were looking out into their yard.  We all felt that it was odd seeing so many deer at a time.  Most of the time we would only see deer while they crossed over the loose asphalt.   As we pulled a 180 degree turn in the dead end is when we all saw what was in the sky. There was a bright light but not bright enough to hurt your eyes which was stationary in one place.  As we kept driving, the road came up to a fork and we took the left.   We were traveling pretty slowly around 15 â€“ 20 miles per hour.  The light was still as bright and in the same spot. The next amazing event was that the light shot off in the direction we headed to the right of us.  The altitude of the light in the sky was about 35 or 40 degrees.  Then POOF, it was gone.  It was almost unexplainable.   The object was in the same spot for at least 3 minutes and flew across the whole right side of our vision.
