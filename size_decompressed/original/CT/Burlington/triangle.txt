As I looked ahead, I saw what appeared to be a plane taking off.  It was flying at a height of about 250 feet, in an eastward direction at about a 30 degree angle.  It seemed strange, but I didn't pay much attention to it until I saw it make a dramatic climb in altitude.  It went from flying at a 30 degree angle to flying at about an 80 degree angle. It was practically flying vertically, and it was climbing altitude rapidly. After about 5 seconds of flying, it had probably risen to a height of about 600 feet. Then, it gradually began to level - off.   Once it was level, it slowly turned left and headed north towards me and my dog.  It banked, and its triangular shape became apparent.  It was probably flying at around 70 miles per hour.  As it approached and passed overhead, I was able to see its underside.  It was clearly a triangular aircraft. It was black or gray in color, and it had one small white light on each corner (which made 3 white lights altogether), and one small red light in the center. It continued to fly north, and I watched it until it disappeared behind the trees.  Throughout the entire flight, it made a low whistling noise, similar to a quiet whoooosh sound. It sounded similar to the sound that an airplane makes as it moves through the air, but I didn't hear the humming of an engine.   The entire experience probably lasted about 1 minute.;41.7563;-72.9436
