Strange organish bright light over northwest CT;2012-02-24 22:03:00;10 minutes;Strange organish bright light over northwest CT When I turned bedroom off, I was ready to bed and I glanced through window.  I firstly thought it was big bright star that looked like Mars.  It looked very bright orangish with two light spots.  It was very slowly and very lower with no noise over the trees.  At the same time I looked other aircrafts higher over it with flicking lights.  Most aircrafts have flicking lights for safety purposes.  That ones I earlier mentioned with no flicking lights.  It moved very, very slowly over 8 minutes from facing east (from Avon mountains) to west (going to Torrington).;41.7563;-72.9436
