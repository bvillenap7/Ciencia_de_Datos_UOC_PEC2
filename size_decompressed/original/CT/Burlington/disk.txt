Flying disk shooting beam of light into trees above haunted cemetery seen by US Soldiers.;2016-03-12 00:30:00;10-12 seconds;Flying disk shooting beam of light into trees above haunted cemetery seen by US Soldiers. One night, me and some friends went to a local haunted cemetery in a small town in CT, famous for it's legend of the Green Lady it was around 12:30am.  The road for this cemetery is on a dirt road in the middle of the woods.  We turned down the road and proceeded to the cemetery.   Coming around a corner there was a massive object hovering directly over the trees shooting some sort of light into the woods next to us.  The object was in the shape of a disk, it had a radius of about id say 35ft.  It had multiple colored lights of blue, green, red, and yellow arohnd the whole craft, the color of the beam it projected into the woods was yellow. We were all in absolute awe, and not to mention scared out of our minds.  The craft didn't stay long once we came into view around the corner, it probably only stayed 10-12 seconds and the when it went away it just shot off in a diagnal line up and across the sky, when it did so it did not make any noise whatsoever.  We tried to follow it by going onto the main road and started heading in the direction it went.  We could see it off in the distance but was soon out of sight completely. Two out of the three witnesses, myself included, are in the United States Army.  All have graduated high school.   None of us drink alcohol at all, and have never tried any sort of drugs.;41.7563;-72.9436
6 ufos, one smokes and they vanish.  ((anonymous report));2017-08-13 16:05:00;5 seconds;6 ufos, one smokes and they vanish. Saw 6 hovering way up in the sky.  We decided to pull over and follow them with the car to get a video.   One started smoking, and as we turned a corner and came to a clearing (.5 seconds later) the disks had vanished.   All we got on camera was the smoke left in the air from the craft. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));41.7563;-72.9436
