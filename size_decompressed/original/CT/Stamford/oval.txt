About 5 minutes later, it came back and flew in the same path, but this time it flew north, it looked like it had docked with another craft, this craft was not glowing.  hovering paralle with That craft that did not have the red glow. once stationary, the glowing craft began to subscide it's glow, getting less bright but with some hues of orange left, enough to light the outline of the object, i could observe that the object was made out of a metalic coloured material that would not reflect the orange light. once the light stopped the objects hovered for another 10 seconds and then shot upwards, no sound or wind are observed throughout the sighting. acouple flights occored during this sighting, it could've been reported to! the faa due to increased flight activity over the sight of the incident within 10 minutes of last sighting.;41.0714765151514;-73.5430799242426

At first I thought it was a runaway kite or balloon, until I noticed there was a duplicate shape alongside it.  They seemed to have a reflective surface on them where only the outer edges could be seen.  They would fly normally for a few seconds and then they would fly in a tumbling motion.   I grabbed my binoculars and when I looked at them they had very bright, but blurry white lights around them.  However, when I looked up at them without the binoculars they didn’t seem to have the same bright lights at all, just enough reflection to see their shape.  If I had to guess their altitude, I would say 3500-5000ft. and a few hundred feet apart from each other.  But I could be wrong since I didn’t know what I was looking at or what their relative size was.   I’m an avid planes potter and usually watch planes through my binoculars.  Planes that leave JFK or Newark are usually at 10,000-13,000ft.  Incoming planes to White Plains airport, are usually 1800-2500ft, but much smaller jets.  These UFO’s were in the same sky where I watch all the planes pass by, however according to my planefinder app, there were no planes over my place when I saw these objects.  They made no noise and flew out of sight within 30 seconds, which makes me believe they were small.  A regular jet, on a clear night, would stay in sight for a few mins.;41.0714765151514;-73.5430799242426
