I left my apartment to visit someone and as i was warming up the car on a clear night, i looked up at the stars and suddenly noticed a brightly lit(white) object that was moving slowly NNW. I thought it might be a private, single engine plane but there was no sound of prop or engine and the light was unlike any i have seen on any aircraft(large or small).  after three soconds it disappeared. i stood outside of my car for a few more minutes to see if the object would/might make a reappearance and after four minutes heard and saw a small jet airplane with pulsing lights( could not possibly have been this object)flying due south. a few minutes later , a single engine plane flew over my vacinity going west. would like to know if anyone else might have seen similar object as i have no one else around me who witnessed this with me. I have witnessed two other anomalies in the past few years, but this is the first one i have reported officially.;41.0714765151514;-73.5430799242426
An unknown bright stationary object in the sky over Stamford, CT;2008-08-24 20:30:00;still there;An unknown bright stationary object in the sky over Stamford, CT On Sunday August 25th around 8:30-8:45 p.m. EST in Stamford, CT we noticed an unknown bright object in the sky. The object was not moving. It was about the size of a plane, but not of the same shape, and was “hanging” at around the same height as that at which you would normally see planes. Judging by the location of the object in relation to our house, it looked like it may have been situated above Cove Island in Stamford or in that general direction. It was difficult to decipher the actual shape, but all of us saw holes in this object through which the light was coming.  There were 4 of us at home (our family) and every one of us saw it. It is now 9:40 p.m. and we are still seeing it. My husband and son took a video of the object.;41.0714765151514;-73.5430799242426

Something caught my eye in the sky and I looked up I could see about 15 to 20 white balls of light above The clouds some were still then they were quickly Zipping around in different directions sometimes coming to A fast halt and they would zip back in the direction From which they  came. They were close together in a A group. It reminded me of how fire flies are in a group Flashing off and on moving around in the dark Except this was quicker. I say about 5 minutes but, it could have been Longer. I became scared so I went back inside I woke my boyfriend up but, He didn’t want to go outside in the cold.;41.0714765151514;-73.5430799242426
