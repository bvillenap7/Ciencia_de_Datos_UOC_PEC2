Driving west on Long Ridge Road, I witnessed a series of six bright white lights hovering in the sky. Upon closer inspection there were blue triangular lights between each of the six white lights. The object seemed to be stationary. I stopped driving to get a closer look. I didnt want to cause an accident, but as I looked around the road, at least four other cars had stopped to look as well. After studing it for approximately 15 to 20 seconds further, I continued driving. The object appeared to be triangular in shape. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length via telephone with this witness, and we found her to be exceptionally lucid and credible.  The case is under investigation by MUFON Connecticut.
