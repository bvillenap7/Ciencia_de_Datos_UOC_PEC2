extremly bright circular light in daylight sky that quickly vanished;2006-03-29 14:24:00;7seconds;extremly bright circular light in daylight sky that quickly vanished I was driving southbound on I-95 between exits 8 and 7 in Stamford CT at 2:24 pm.  Something caught my eye and I glanced at the upper left hand side of my windshield. I saw an extremely bright stationary object at about a 10:00 position in the daylight sky. It was intensely bright,like sunlight reflecting off a mirror. Although reflected light tends to spray outwards - this appeared to be a perfect circle or orb approx 3/4 inch in diameter from my position in the driver's seat. I thought it might be the sun reflecting off a plane, but it was too large, much too bright and a little too low to be an aircraft. To my relief, the brightness gave way or folded to a flat and dull grey slender shape. I had thought it was plane after all. I looked away for a 1/2 a second and when I returned to look at the object and it was completely gone from view - vanished. I searched the sky - nothing. In the farthest distance high up in the sky I could see the trails of an airplane and  other commercial aircraft far to my left. It was really weird. I work for an airline and live in in Fairfield County CT where there are always commercial aircraft in route. I searched UFO related sites to see if anyone else saw it because there were so many cars on the highway. It freaked me out butI'm still holding out for a logical explaination. Now I know what people mean when they say they saw a bright light in the sky. It is out of the ordinary;41.0714765151514;-73.5430799242426
Very bright light hung low in the sky, circular shape whose light would glow very bright and fade.   ((NUFORC Note:  Venus??  PD));2015-04-15 21:30:00;30 minutes;Very bright light hung low in the sky, circular shape whose light would glow very bright and fade on and off.  Halo around it 9:30 pm.  Neighbor called me to come out and view bright light in the street above his house laying low in the sky.  His household had 4 observers and I came out with 3 observers.  By the time I came out with binoculars, the object moved from above his house to another angle in the sky.  It was still very very bright and hung within the scope of the tree lines.  The shape was circular and it had a haze, aura around it.  The light would brighten and fade, brighten and fade, on and off.  When looking though the binoculars, you could see a red and at times blue ring around it as well.   Before I came out, my neighbor said at times it appeared circular in nature, but would also change to a rectangular shape.  It was not a drone.  In fact, my neighbor took some great pictures of it when it was above his house.  It is a very odd picture, as in one shot in particular, it appeared that you could see the shape of someone or something standing in the center of the bright light.   We stood out there for about 30 minutes.  I know this sounds all very strange, but it was nothing I have ever seen or could identify. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a sighting of Venus.
