I was lying in my bed at around 11:00 PM on December 17, 2008 watching t.v. I heard an airplane going by outside, as usual, and looked out my looked out the window which is right next to my bed and as I looked I saw the plane I heard, but then a second later, a light dashed quickly across the night sky. It was about the size of what the moon looks like and was turquoise blue. It came out of no where and did what seemed to be a slight decrease in speed before speeding away in a slightly different direction. It  went across the horizon from South to North and speed away at an abnormally fast speed. I immediately jumped up from my bed and placed my head against the open window. It was gone though. It had left so fast across the sky. I remember thinking, well it traveled as fast as an meteorite, but it was just way too big and way too low. I don't know what this phenomena was, but I know what it wasn't and it wasn't a meteorite and it wasn't any man made machine that I am familiar with.;41.0714765151514;-73.5430799242426
Ice Blue - White Lights over Stamford, CT;2011-06-27 22:37:00;2 minutes;Ice Blue - White Lights over Stamford, CT Since I was a child I have witnessed UFO's.   Over the past several months I have personally witnessed a ice blue light glide across the sky (specifically over my home) and then fade until it vanishes.  Airplanes frequently fly over my house so I can tell what an airplane is and what isn't an airplane.   I attempted to video record the object but the camera jammed.  My goal is to get solid evidence. A month ago this object appeared while my friend was over and I pointed it out to him.  A week after I was in the yard with my girlfriend and I pointed it out to her.  This object goes from a dim light to a bright ice blue. On 6/27/11 and 6/28/11,  my brother and I were in the backyard.  I told him he would see something and we did.  On the 27th the bright ice blue object glided across the sky from west to east.  On the 28th the object glided from the northwest to southeast, but this time it was a bright white and a major rumbling occured at the same time. I live in the Belltown area of Stamford, CT.   If anyone else has seen these objects I'd like to get your point of view.;41.0714765151514;-73.5430799242426
Two white bright flashes took up the whole room and disappeared in a matter of seconds.;2014-03-19 06:00:00;3 seconds;Two white bright flashes took up the whole room and disappeared in a matter of seconds. It was really early in the morning, so it was still really dark outside.  My father was outside turning on the cars, when all of a sudden a huge flash of light engulfed the whole room.   I was staring into a mirror at the time so I noticed the light came from behind me.  It was like the light of a camera flash and the room turned completely bright white.  It was only for a couple seconds.   It was not lighting or the car headlights because they weren't even on.   After the incident, I turned around and ran outside because I assumed at first it was lighting or something happened to the car and my dad.  However, to my surprise he was oblivious to what had just happened inside.  He had no idea.  I started freaking out and that's when my sister approached the scene.  She thought I was crazy but then again, it happened.  Although, this time I didn't see it.  She did and described it in the same manner.   These incidents happened in the same place after approximately 3 minute intervals.;41.0714765151514;-73.5430799242426
Orbs of bright light traveling tightly in formation over LI Sound.;2016-03-17 22:00:00;10+ minutes;Orbs of bright light traveling tightly in formation over LI Sound. My husband called as he was approaching home to tell me to come outside with two of our children to take a look at some strange, bright lights that he observed over our area.  We live on the Long Island sound in an area called Westcot Cove.  A short walk down to the beach area, we can see clear across to Long Island.  These lights were orb shaped and very bright.   My husband initially stated that he saw about 5 at first hovering over the area at a seemingly low altitude.  By the time we ran out and approached the beach, we saw about 3.  They traveled very tightly together and made no noise, came down a bit lower over the sound and headed towards Long Island seemingly side by side.  Once over Long Island, they just hovered very brightly.  One of the lights eventually dimmed and went out as did another.  One remained bright the entire time.  I started to think maybe they were helicopters but the brightness of the lights and the way they moved so closely together confused us all quite a bit.  Even when they moved away from us towards LI, they just seemed like balls of light..  Light all around.   We wound up leaving as the one remained and continued to hover around.  Maybe someone will post what it was by morning.  Also, a dog in the area along the sound starting making a god awful howl while we were observing this.;41.0714765151514;-73.5430799242426
