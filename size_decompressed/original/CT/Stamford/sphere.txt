Amber spherical object;2011-04-07 21:54:00;2 Seconds;Amber spherical object I was out shopping for a few things and returned home.  As i stepped out to gather my bags, I decided to look up to see whether the sky had increased in cloud cover since it had rained earlier in the day.  What I saw was an amber colored sphere with what looked like a fading tail behind it. It was headed in  what appeared to be a north easterly direction. It was moving faster than any plane that I have ever seen and did not make any noise.  I have seen several strange things in the past (one of which I have reported), but I guess I can add this one to the collection.;41.0714765151514;-73.5430799242426
