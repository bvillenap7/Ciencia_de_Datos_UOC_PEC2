Domino shaped white dot formation above I-95N NY/CT leaving dotted trail behind it.  ((NUFORC Note:  Skywriting pattern??  PD));2008-08-17 13:30:00;at least minutes;Domino shaped white dot formation above I-95N NY/CT leaving dotted trail behind it. I'm not one who typically believes or follows this kind of stuff but what I saw driving home from NYC on I-95N was hard to ignore or explain.  Maybe someone has a rational answer for what it was. Clear as can be but very high in the sky above the highway I saw a formation of white dots.  There were eight dots with a line down the center, four on each side, exactly the way a domino with 8 dots would be set up.  Never losing form it slowly moved through the sky leaving a chemtrail looking trail of white dots behind it.  Round white dots evenly spaced making four perfect lines of dots behind it.  The older dots had dissapated leaving just a cloudy white ribbon for miles and the newer made ones stayed as dots for quite some time.  The formation didn't move in a straight line, it slowly turned and twisted a bit and went in and out from a cloud all the while the trail of dots were evenly spit from it. I don't know how long it lasted.  I watched it for a few minutes until I had finally driven past it.  I don't know how many other drivers saw it, it was very visable.   I tried to take a picture with my phone while driving but it didn't come out.  I'm very curious if anyone has any idea what that was that I saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible skywriting, we believe.

4 Objects over CT, April 30th.;2016-04-30 21:00:00;20 minutes;4 Objects over CT, April 30th Sightings started at 9pm EST.  All crafts were moving in a south (from the direction of Long Island) to north direction.  1st craft was in a trapezium was moving at an intense speed.  It almost appeared as a retreat from something.   The 2nd craft appeared about 9:07pm EST and had 3 lights in the shape of a perfect triangle.  This craft moved slower than the previous one, but still moving quickly.   The 3rd craft appeared about 9:19pm EST.  It was a single light moving extremely slowly.  For some reason this one gave me a bad feeling.   The 4th craft was moving at a moderately fast speed.  It appeared to be 3 circular lights forming a triangle, but they were very close together.  Are there any other witnesses??;41.0714765151514;-73.5430799242426
