We watched it fly South West to East.   It flew above us and circled us approaching closer, enough for us to see its shape.   We did not see metal, we saw light and it circled and right above us it gave us a golden glow, and then it flew away quickly disappearing.  There was no wind, no sound, and it was other wordly quick. Watching it fly away, we noticed an odd-looking constellation.  Upon closer observation, it appeared to be either a cluster of U.F.O', a Mothership, or some other huge robotic looking structure in the sky.;41.0714765151514;-73.5430799242426
