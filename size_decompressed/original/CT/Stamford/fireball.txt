Orange fireballs.;2012-11-16 18:00:00;5 minutes;We were leaving the restaurant at that time.   I looked up into the sky and saw these two orange fireballs side by side, they were approaching from the South heading North, they made a sharp turn heading East toward Long Island Sound.  They were exactly as seen on Coast to Coast website.   I could not find one other person to view them except my husband.
