Mothership over Litchfield CT;1971-10-15 20:30:00;6min aprox;Mothership over Litchfield CT I was enrolled at a school for boys called Connecticut Junior Republic in Lichfield in 1971,I was part of a gymnastic troupe that was coming back from exibition in Bantam CT we were in a passenger pannel van just coming into the downtown area of Lichfield CT when for some reason traffic came to a halt.  I still don't know why but we were stopped on a main road.  When someone noticed a very large disc shaped object hovering just above the trees, directly above us.  I was in the rear of the van where there are no seats so I opened the rear door of the van and simply got out and looked straight up at the object.  It was at least two football feilds wide, completely round, it was motionless, with bright multi-colored lights that ran around the rim of the craft.  The other kids in the van with me got out and were staring at it along with me.  We could not believe what we were seeing.  The adult that was driving the van was yelling continuously get back in the van.  Because we were on a main road with traffic in front and behind us.  I noticed some of the other drivers were also out of their vehicles looking at this object.  The only thing I can compare it to, is the mothership in the movie Close Encounters of the Third Kind.  What is really weird is when we got back to the school no one spoke of what we had just seen.  It is as if it never happened.  To this day I have no memory of any of us ever getting back into the van.  My only memory is of just being back at the school that night.  I will never forget that night.
