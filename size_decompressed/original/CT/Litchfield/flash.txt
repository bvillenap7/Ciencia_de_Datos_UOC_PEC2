My sighting took place on September 11, 2012, time was 3:00 am to 3:15 am, sky was clear no clouds, no moon that I can remember, ufo had a very erratic flight pattern moving up and down left to right flickering and almost a tumble pattern.  Colors seem to change some green and redish colors primary color star white.  I feel this was a true UFO.  I also have video and have shown it only to family, and also showed it to a retired airline pilot and his wife, who has her private pilots license both could not identify.  Would like to show video to ufo community, to try and explain it to me.  Thank you for reading.;41.7618;-73.2007
