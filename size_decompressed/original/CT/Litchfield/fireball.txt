Sparkling green fireball shooting over Litchfield CT.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor, we suspect.  PD));2009-08-14 23:50:00;5 seconds;Sparkling green fireball shooting over Litchfield CT It was around 11:30 pm August 14, 2009, when I was standing out on my deck looking at the stars in the very clear night sky. Then, facing west, over the house I noticed a bright green fireball streaking across the sky from south to north.  It was moving much slower than the shooting star that I had seen 10 minutes earlier,  but much faster than the planes I see fly over all the time.  The green fireball had sparkles coming off it, and had a long green trail behind it.  It was a very strange thing to see.  I cannot say for sure how high up it was, but it appeared to me to be fairly low, certainly lower than the shooting star. The whole thing lasted maybe 5 seconds. I would really like to know what that was.  The sparkles coming from it are puzzling. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor, we suspect.  PD));41.7618;-73.2007
Orange balls in fleet formation.;2010-09-12 00:00:00;ten minutes;Orange balls in fleet formation About midnight of a new day on 9/12/10, my son and I saw 12-14 large orange balls moving very fast, silently and horizontally across the night sky.  They were coming from the south and heading northwest and were quite high in the sky and much larger than any stars.  They seemed to be in some sort of flight formation with one following the other in twos.   Unfortunately, the photos do not show the glowing spheres of orange.   I wondered it that could be because the glow is caused by some sort of gaseous matter.;41.7618;-73.2007
