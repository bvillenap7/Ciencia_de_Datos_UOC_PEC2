It flew about 200 feet over the ground.  It was night time but because it was so close to the ground I had a great view of it.  The color appeared to be grey it had two airplane tails on the back. Just like a plane has one tail on the end of  it this had two.  It also had a 2 extreamelly bright lights on the front they appeared to be in a circle form.  I could see this object from several minutes away.  A bright light glared in my room i looked out the window and I thought i have not seen a plane this bright so i kept watching it and about 3 minutes later it came verry close flying right above my house.  It had an awkard sound almost like a plane but allitle different. My main question is, are there any planes with 2 verry bright headlights?;41.3319;-73.2367
