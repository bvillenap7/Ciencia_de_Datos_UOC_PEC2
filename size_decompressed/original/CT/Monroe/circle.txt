The light was circular and in the sky.  It did not look like a plane and that is what made us think it was a UFO.   It continued to travel over our heads instead of in front of us.  We realized it had suddenly started moving very quickly then it literally made a 90 degree turn extremely fast and started moving in the other direction.  It was moving extremely fast and was high in the sky and looked very odd.   We took a picture of it and when we tried it ended up looking very odd, almost like ripples on the water.;41.3319;-73.2367
