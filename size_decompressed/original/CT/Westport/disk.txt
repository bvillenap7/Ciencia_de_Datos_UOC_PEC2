Large saucer in the sky over Westport, CT!;2009-09-27 23:00:00;1 minute;Large saucer in the sky over Westport, CT! Late at night, I saw an enormous saucer in the sky above my house. This town is right near the Long Island sound and the ocean, and the saucer was floating through the sky towards the water. There were no lights or sound, it was simply illuminated by the moon. Shortly after first noticing the object, it disappeared behind the tree line, as there are tons of trees in this area. Did anyone else see this???;41.1417552941176;-73.3534258823528
