Westport, CT possible sighting;2003-06-01 19:30:00;10 seconds;Westport, CT possible sighting We (2 NYC suburb professional females, one late 30's and the other early 40's)  were driving down I95 South from Fairfield CT to Norwalk CT.  It was early evening 7:30pm? (dark) about 2 or 3 years ago.  I am sorry I do not remember the exact date.   We saw an object in the sky that looked like a stealth bomber (black, triangular) with bright lights along the edge of it.  It was hovering to the right side of I-95 over homes!   We turned to each other at the same time and asked what is that?.  We rolled down the windows in our car but could not hear any noise.  If it were a plane or a jet, we certainly would have heard something.  It appeared to be hovering extremely low to the ground.   If it were a plane it would have been moving very quickly, and would have certainly crashed at that low of an altitude.   We don't think anyone else saw it except us.  It is a very busy highway and surely it would have been reported in the newspaper (it was not, we looked for reports!).   As we were on I-95, a very busy highway, we could not stop.   I (the passenger) in the car, turned around to see if I could see more, but could not.  We had no explanation for it.   We saw the Peter Jennings report and our sighting seemed very similar to other sightings.  My friend and I frequently mention this sighting to eachother and how strange it was.  Both of us to this day, remember it very clearly.  We just wonder why no one else saw it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous indicates that the date is approximate.  We suspect many probably did witness the object they just didn't report it.  PD));41.1417552941176;-73.3534258823528
