NO REPORTS OF SHOOTING STARS WERE REPORTED FOR THAT DATE/TIME/AREA.  JUST NOTICED A FLASH OUT OF THE CORNER OF MY EYE IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE CAMERA FLASH.  DIDN'T THINK OF IT UNTIL LOOKING AT THE PHOTOS LATER THAT DAY.  I HAVE ATTACHED 2 PHOTOS.  ONE CLOSE UP.  LOOKS LIKE BLUE TO RED (MAYBE HEAT COMING OFF IT AS IT ENTERED THE ATMOSPHERE?)  IT WAS 5/24/2006 AT EXACTLY 4:37:42AM. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));41.1417552941176;-73.3534258823528
