Low, silent procession of orange 15-20 lights slowly flying over Westport to over Long Island Sound;2012-06-25 21:40:00;2-3 minutes;Low, silent procession of orange 15-20 lights slowly flying over Westport to over Long Island Sound Driving car along Compo Beach, on cloudy, overcast night. Just dropped off my son to see friends. No moon or starlight. Saw two or three large orange lights flying, low, slowly over Westport proceeding toward Long Island Sound. Lights about the size of a shirt button at arms length. While almost directly overhead, they appeared to be flying low and slow. If lights were not low, then they would have had to be huge.  Saw another light following first lights, then another, then another. All moving in straight line toward Long Island. Pulled car over to watch as more lights continued to add to the widely spaced procession of lights. Fifteen to twenty in all. Car windows rolled down, but could hear no sound. Another car stopped at a stop sign - not moving - as lights flew by.  Returned home and texted my son who saw them also, but said they looked red to him.;41.1417552941176;-73.3534258823528
White-orange lights, in row, slowly crossing sky;2012-07-04 22:00:00;10 minutes;White-orange lights, in row, slowly crossing sky At Compo Beach, after the annual Westport 4th of July fireworks display, my son and his friends observed five lights moving across the sky. A little over a week ago, on 06/25-2012, my wife reported a dramatically similar phenomenon at this same location, and reported it to NUFORC.  My son and friends were also there at the earlier occasion and saw the lights then too.  According to my son, this sighting was pretty much the same thing as he had seen previously, except this time the lights appeared to be higher in the sky.  In the first sighting they appeared very low. Since I'm reporting this 2nd hand, I hesitate to provide more information.  But my son took a short video which I will email to NUFORC.;41.1417552941176;-73.3534258823528
Green fluorescent sphere over Saugatuck River.;2015-01-25 21:40:00;2 minutes;Green fluorescent sphere over Saugatuck River. While driving on I-95 South last night at 9:40 pm, I observed a fluorescent green sphere traveling up the Saugatuck River at a slow rate of speed.   The object descended as it made its way toward I-95, then appeared to disappear from sight as it approached the rooftops of the houses that are located on the riverbank.
