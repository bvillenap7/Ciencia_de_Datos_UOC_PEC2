Fast;Summary : Two men in 20's, witness a beam of greenish light on merritt parkway.  maybe metor, very fast and split in two right over us. We are two men in late 20's business perfessionals.  Looked like maybe a metor.  very fast and very bright!  a greenish look.  we were in car travelling about 55 mph.  it stood out, and split apart and continued across the horizon.  hard to say the height of it.  but it was close enough to notice the light instantly.  it was pretty large.  again it had a neonish green appearence!;41.1417552941176;-73.3534258823528
White dot motionless in sky begins to move- sheds into two white dots;2007-04-21 18:20:00;20;White dot motionless in sky begins to move- sheds into two white dots The sky was blue and practically clear- except some stratus clouds.  A white dot is stationed motionless in the sky.  Two planes pass right under it, showing that this dot lies somewhere higher in the stratosphere.  These stratus clouds pass over it, which dims the object, so it's obviously higher then these clouds. As the sky clears and the sun shines you can see this white dot much clearer.  After about 20 minutes it, the white dot starts to move across the sky at a steady pace, as it moves a fair distance it appears to shed another white dot.  So now there are 2 white dots traveling across the sky, and they end up traveling out of my range of vision.  This is the third time I have seen these shapes.  All three in different parts of the country.  Can never explain nor figure out what type of UFO this could be.;41.1417552941176;-73.3534258823528
