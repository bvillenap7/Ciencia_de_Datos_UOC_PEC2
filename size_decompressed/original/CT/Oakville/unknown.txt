Zigzagging object;2011-11-02 19:00:00;10 mins;Zigzagging object In the western sky just after sundown - a glowing object low on the horizon.  Took the binoculars and went back outside to get a better look.  It was still there and when seen through the binoculars it appeared to be a red and green sphere that would suddenly start zigzagging around.   I called my husband outside and he saw it also.;41.5879;-73.0872
