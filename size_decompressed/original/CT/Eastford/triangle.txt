Huge dark triangular object.;2018-08-21 19:00:00;1 minute;Huge dark triangular object I saw a massive, dark (black or dark gray), object passing high over the treeline and below the clouds.  It was the shape of an isosceles triangle, much wider in the rear, and the 2 rear corners had intermittently flashing lights.  I am unsure of the color of the lights or if they were even colored.   The object was huge and moving south.  There was no sound at first and then I heard helicopter type of sounds but none were visible.;41.8765;-72.0851
