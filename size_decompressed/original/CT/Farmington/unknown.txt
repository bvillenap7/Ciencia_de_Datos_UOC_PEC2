We paused for a second and noticed 3 Lights, white, red and white flashing about every second. In a rotating pattern. It seemed to be in a circle but we coulden't see the outline of the craft. No sound at all. Moving about as fast as a small air plane. It moved In an irratic curved path across the sky.;41.7299;-72.8433000000001
One big mothership that emitted two smaller crafts, all changing colors;2019-09-26 18:15:00;7 minutes;One big mothership that emitted two smaller crafts, all changing colors The two of us saw 3 odd looking lights in the sky.  We were trying to see if they were moving or not, and they were only hovering.  About 1 minute later, we saw one of the smaller crafts start to speed up really fast, stop and hover, then continued to speed away and disappear completely.  The second smaller craft did the same exact thing.  But then, we saw a HUGE light, much bigger than the two smaller crafts combined.  The bigger craft actually seemed to have emitted the smaller two objects actually.  The big one moved only slightly, but then started to speed up quickly, disappearing moments after. On all the crafts, there were these triangular lights, flashing around the craft, red, white, and the craft itself kept on changing from a yellow light to a white light.;41.7299;-72.8433000000001
