I first assumed it was an airplane, but instead of a blinking light, this object had a constant light source.   Also, unlike an airplane this object did not have a constant travel path.  It went in many directions.  Then, after approximately 3 minutes, the light source mysteriously disappeared.  Even though the light disappeared, I was still able to see the minuscule black object moving around in the distance.  After 5 minutes I lost sight of the object. I am 100% positive this u.f.o was not a shooting star or an airplane.;41.7299;-72.8433000000001
