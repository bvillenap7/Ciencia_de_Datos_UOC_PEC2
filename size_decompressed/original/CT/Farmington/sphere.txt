I was out walking my dogs in the back yard, when, as I looked toward the treetops, a huge, intensely colored neon-green sphere was slowly rising. Once it got above the tops of the trees, and was completely visible, it quickly shot upward even more, and within a matter of seconds had moved from one side of the sky to the opposite, leaving behind it a distinct crackling sound, much as a jet leaves a sound trail. For the duration of these happenings, the entire sky lit up neon green, and was, as I describe, brighter than day. I could see everything, and given the circumstances, thought we were being bombed. Once everything was back to normal, and the object was no longer visible, I could see flickering trails that were the same color as the UFO disappearing almost as quickly as they were able to be seen. This all happened within a matter of seconds, but everything remains so clear in my mind. As I went back inside to tell my family, there had been reports of transformers blowing around the county, and a wire down on a nearby street. These events seem peculiar to me, and though there could be some rational explanation, I am very skeptical. I know what I saw, and I've never seen or heard of anything that comes close to being like it, especially not the fact that the entire sky was brightened even past the normal daylight we are all accustomed to. I leave it up to the readers of my sighting to come up with a logical explanation to this, whether it was something explanable or in fact a UFO.
