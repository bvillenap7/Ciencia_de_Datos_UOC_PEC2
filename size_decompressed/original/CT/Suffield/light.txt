Possible UFO SIGHTING July 31, 2015 – Suffield, CT – 9:45 – 10:30 PM +  Clear evening sky. Bright object – planet/star size in Western sky about 45 degrees above horizon [2:30 – 3:00 position (with straight up being 12:00)].  I sat down in yard to watch this object, as it seemed to move.  I could then easily tell it was zig-zagging multiple directions within a small area (about 1 minute radius).  I used my binoculars to confirm it was a single point, but hand too shaky to tell any movement. I could not reach local Bradley Airport nor local WTIC radio/TV station to see if any other reports. Movement was somewhat regular as it moved around, then stopped in place for a few minutes, and then moved around again.  Brightness never changed, and only white light.;41.99;-72.642

I looked around to see if I could see where it would have gone, if it were  a plane or helicopter and there was nothing.  I saw other planes far off in the distance and all had flashing white and red lights as normal.  (So concluding what I saw was NOT a normal aircraft that I have ever seen before);41.99;-72.642
