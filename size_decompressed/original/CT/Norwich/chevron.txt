20+ low-flying craft with red, green and white flashing lights;2008-07-02 23:45:00;45 minutes;20+ low-flying craft with red, green and white flashing lights Low-flying craft, blinking/flashing green light on left, red on right, with white blinking lights in center.  No tail lights, but could see front blinking lights from behind as they passed over. For about 45 minutes, I saw at least 20 of these fly over from west to east. They were moving fairly fast, and made very little sound for something flying so low. The night was very clear, I could not make out the shape too well, but one looked boomerang shaped. As they were so near, and I couldn't make out an aircraft shape,or hear a motor sound, it doesn't make any sense. The nearest airport closes at 10:00 pm. I called the FAA tower, state police, DOT, and there were no other reports.;41.5362;-72.0832999999999
