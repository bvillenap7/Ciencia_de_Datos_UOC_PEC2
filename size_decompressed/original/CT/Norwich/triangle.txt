The two objects had a rapid bright blinking white flash which was constant.  Looking into the sky, they were approximately 2 feet apart.  I don't know what that represents in distance.   The triangular shaped objects would quickly dart about an inch in distance then stay motionless for 3 to 8 seconds.  The direction of these darting movements seemed random with no particular pattern.  The two objects did not dart simultaneously or even in the same direction but they did seem to stay the same approximate the distance apart the entire time I observed them which was 15 minutes;41.5362;-72.0832999999999
