bright stationary object quickly shooting upwards at a 45 degree angle;2007-03-30 00:00:00;seconds;bright stationary object quickly shooting upwards at a 45 degree angle At midnight, looking out into the North, aside another less bright star, a so called brighter and larger star, apparently a UFO, being stationary for a few seconds, shot up on a 45 degree angle very quickly and within a second or two, disappeared from my view. This was too far away to see anything other than the brightness of the object.;41.5362;-72.0832999999999

neon purple against the black sky;2019-10-11 20:00:00;2 hours;Dark night sky had one area that was lit up pink, and then later on it was brilliant neon purple against the black sky.  We took pictures and posted and several others saw it as well with no explanation of where the light was coming from.  I could see from my front step and never saw it before this time and havenâ€™t seen it again since.;41.5362;-72.0832999999999
12 disc shaped objects float upwards and then vanish;2019-11-03 01:45:00;15 minutes;12 disc shaped objects float upwards and then vanish I came home from driving a few Lyft rides I walked to my backyard where my garbage cans are to throw something away when I noticed in a perfectly clear sky an orange/yellow light starting about where clouds would normally be and going very high and then disappearing.  I was frozen staring at it because it did not blink or make sound.  Then to my amazement another 1 appeared and started moving up while 2 more were there now too all moving exactly the same speed and distance apart.  I tried to video them as they were so clear to my eye I thought it would video great too, but to my dismay it wouldn't even show on my iphone screen. After those vanished I saw another 1, I wanted so bad for someone else to see this so I ran inside my house very quickly and got my 15 year old son up from bed and ran outside with him.  When we got outside there was 3 of them very clearly moving up like the others.  I tried to take a video again and this one did work, but the video d! oes not do it justice compared to actually seeing it.  When I take a screenshot of the object it looks like a spinning disc.  I have 3 videos showing them.  I know what helicopters, planes, drones, lanterns look like and this was not any of them.  After about 15 minutes and seeing roughly 12 of these objects it was over!  I stayed outside for an hour after and looked up to see if anymore would appear but nothing.  It was absolutely amazing as I have never seen anything like it before.  I wish I could know exactly what it was as I am still stumped.;41.5362;-72.0832999999999
