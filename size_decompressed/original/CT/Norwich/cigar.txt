Black thick scroll design in wing position.;2020-11-02 15:30:00;5 seconds;Black thick scroll design in wing position. I noticed, what I first thought was, an airplane. It had a large black scroll design, thick in structure, where the wing would be. No tail. Realizing it was unusual, I turned to pick up my phone to take a picture and returned, less than 3 seconds later, to find it was gone. I stepped outside to search the sky. There was no obstruction of the sky for miles in all directions. It was completely gone.;41.5362;-72.0832999999999
