glowy fuzzy white butterfly/angel shaped thing.  ((NUFORC Note:  Result of earlier missile launch.  PD));2004-08-31 20:30:00;20 minutes;glowy fuzzy white butterfly/angel shaped thing. butterfly/angel shaped fuzzy glowy white thing very very high up in atmosphere.  blinking thing on tip of it.  Did not disipate like a cloud would.  was brighter as it was lower on the horizon and darker as it passed overhead.  but still very very high up(above orbit or so)  easily as big as the moon looks in the night sky. looked it with binoculars as well and have no idea what it was.  very very slow moving.  my 20:30 time is approximate, but i saw it about 5 minutes after my adephia cable internet went out cuz that is why i even went outside.  They reported an area wide outage.  no clouds in sky, all stars were nice and clear. ((NUFORC Note:  Result of earlier missile launch.
