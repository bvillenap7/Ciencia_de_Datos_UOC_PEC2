The sky was already pitch black. I looked up in the sky for a moment and heard what I can only describe as the sound of a trombone when you blow really hard. And I saw a cigar shaped black saucer with a flagpole like thing on the top of it's buble window. It had a blinking light that was white in the front, and a white light in the back that didn't blink. It would fly east from where I was standing. And when it flew it would stop for about ten seconds, then continue to fly for another ten over and over about five times until it just shot really fast out of sight going east. It still made that trombone sound even when it stopped flying. That is all I saw.;41.3361;-72.7799
