Bright green slow flashes (2) one after another lasting 2-3 secs. through solid cloud deck. No a/c heard in vicinity. ((anonymous rept);2019-02-24 22:15:00;2 seconds;Bright green slow flashes (2) one after another lasting 2-3 secs. through solid cloud deck.  No aircraft heard in vicinity. Walking while looking directly north (clouds deck overhead no visibility of stars) first one slow 2 to 3 sec flash GREEN like maybe a meteor, but extremely bright to be able to see thru clouds, followed by a second slow 2-3 sec flash of equal brightness. Best guess 2 green meteors coming down.  Both were lighting the sky from horizon up to 60' above north horizon and from northwest to northeast expansion.  No sound or blast wave followed.  But they did look close to be so bright through a solid cloud deck.  I was standing just 50 yards north of highway 80 and totoket road intersection walking north in RV park.  I am a pilot and amatuer astronomer and well versed in sky phenomenon.  I only saw the flashes which were green and lit up the cloud deck above me as described above.  No other visible indications.  I waited but nothing followed.  I can say by the color of flash etc... it was not a ground vehicle lights or any ground based lights causing this.  Nothing to north but trees and countryside.
