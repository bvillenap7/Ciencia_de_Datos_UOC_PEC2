We both went outside for a cigarette after dinner and observed what we thought may have been a satellite or possibly the space station, but noting that the color of the object was a more orange/reddish hue.  It was small in the sky, but larger than any stars, thinking it may have been an aircraft, it went in a straight line for around 15 seconds, then seemed to completely change course and do a 45 degree turn then disappear.
