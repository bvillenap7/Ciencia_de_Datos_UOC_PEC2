Heading south on Sullivan Avenue, I noticed a very large plane or military helicopter moving extremely slow.  Within seconds i realized it was neither.  This object was practically hovering above me without any sound.  One glowing strobe light across the entire underside, with one round light on each end.  These lights were not bright, somewhat muted.  It also seemed as if it was composed of box like shapes within the sphere.  It began to slowly change direction, and when I turned my vehicle around towards Rt 5, it was gone.  No sound, hovering above me, probably 150 ft oval/square shapeâ€¦ I was the only vehicle in all directions, complete silence.;41.8363;-72.5596
