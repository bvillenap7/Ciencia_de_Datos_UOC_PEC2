UFO hovering over potato field behind my girlfriends house;1970-07-15 19:00:00;5 min.;UFO hovering over potato field behind my girlfriends house Oject was hovering over a potato field behind my girlfriends house. It was late in the day around 7pm. My brother was walking home from a friend's house and I was in my bedroom window calling him home. At that time we both saw a gigantic ufo just hovering very low looking like it may want to land. I called over to my friends house to tell them to look out into their back yard and at that moment it disappeared in a flash. It was silver in color with lights that went around it. It did'nt make a sound. It was huge. My brother witnessed it as well as he was just about in front of our home at this time.;41.8363;-72.5596

Observered several bright orange oval shaped lights over South Windsor CT around 10 mins;2012-10-05 20:00:00;5-7 minutes;Observered several bright orange oval shaped lights over South Windsor CT around 10 mins On the evening of October 5, 2012, myself, husband and a friend were sitting and watching a Yankee Game on TV.  It was around 8:00 pm when my husband looked out our back slider into the sky thinking he was seeing some sort of fireworks.  We scrambled out onto our deck to watch however it was clearly not fireworks.  It was a fairly clear sky. We were looking toward the east/southeast.  These lights were quite visible to each of us.  They were a bright orange in color, sort of oval in shape.  There were approximately 10 to 12 of them in sort of a formation.  They seemed to just hover in the sky, with no sound.  It lasted for around 5-7 minutes then they just seemed to evaporate.  We did call our local police department and reported the strange incident.;41.8363;-72.5596
Orange round objects in formation proceeding in upward movement from northwest sky.;2013-06-09 22:00:00;3-4 minutes;Orange round objects in formation proceeding in upward movement from northwest sky. Multiple (five to six) glowing orange round objects out of the northwest proceeding in formation towards west in upward direction then faded away.  Objects moved at  speed as would a jet airliner.  Objects showed no blinking lights or normal aircraft lights that typically are seen.  Distance between objects varied but in general formation heading towards same path towards west and climbing to higher altitude and then faded away. Estimated time is approximate at 22:00 on 6/9/13.  Initial observation altitude (elevation above the horizon) would be about 20-25 degrees.  Objects viewed from South Windsor, however, event origination estimates could be locations from East Hartford/Hartford northwest area.;41.8363;-72.5596
White-greenish light across the sky;2020-08-14 21:45:00;15 seconds;White-greenish light across the sky Around 9:45PM on 8/14/2020, my passenger and I saw a bright white and greenish light go across the sky then disappear.  It was going quite fast and we both said to each other, what was that?.  We didn't discuss it much until we got to our destination then told separate people of what we saw and our stories matched.  We were going east-southeast on Gray Street towards Avery Street in South Windsor, CT.  We could see the blinking red light on the tower in the distance while this was happening.  This was just over the tree tops and made no noise.;41.8363;-72.5596
