I thought it was a helicopter hovering in the dark sky. suddenly the sphere shot like a bullet straight toward us and over my head. It was so fast that i thought it was a light turning off on an earth based aircraft, but i also believed that i saw a glimps of a trail straight over my head. then at that moment my brother said wow! Did you see that? I almost didnt believe my owne eyes until he said that. my response was Oh my God...you really saw that too? this confirmed to the both of us that what we both could have passed off as some wierd hallucination was if fact very real. Since then we have seen television stories about space shuttle personel wittnessing similer balls of light.We had never seen these repoorts until the early 90's and our experience occured during the middle 80's.
