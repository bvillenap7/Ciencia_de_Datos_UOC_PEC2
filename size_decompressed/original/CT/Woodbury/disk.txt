We were driving home from my brithday party and I looked up in the sky and saw a ufo hovering in the sky (it seemed like it was at a very high altitude).  I could tell it was metalic because the sun glemed off its surfase.  I could see enough of the craft to tell it was a disk with a slightly domed roof. As I looked at it I said to my mom look! its a ufo she responed ok cool I belive you (in a sarcastic tone) I turned to argue, when I looked back it was gone.
