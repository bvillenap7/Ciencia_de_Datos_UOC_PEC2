Flying objects, Similar to planes, but almost postive they weren't planes.;2004-04-29 21:00:00;30mins;Flying objects, Similar to planes, but almost postive they weren't planes. I am only reporting this because it is similiar to the guys report in Enfield. Unfortunatly, i do not remeber what day it was. Though it could n ot have been more then 2 weeks ago. I was driving from bethlehem to naugatuck. Crossing route 6, i saw this thing. that looked similiar to a plane, it was really low, REALLY LOW and going down at an angle. When i got to route 6 not even 30seconds later i looked to the right and there was nothing. My boyfriend was behind me and he told me it was an Helicopter. Well i got to middlebury where westover was and i passed westover and i looked up and i saw the same thing! but this time it did look like an helicopter because it fast across the road.. <---- like that. Then it went up the side of the trees.. toward my direction. It was REALLY REALLY low. Like above the trees. I slowed down to see what it was.. It was just sitting there. I couldn't really see a body shape at all. I could only see the lights.. which made a shape similiar to a plane... It had wing lights on the very edges and a light on what seemed to be a tail. but there was nothing else then that and it was just SITTING THERE and then it started to move away.. very very very slowly. So by now i am freaked out.. i called my boyfriend who went another way and when i drove by hop brook in naugatuck, he called me. He said there was one over his head where he was in nauagatuck. He said it was real low but he rolled down his window and it sounded like a plane but he wasn't sure. I just think its really strange and bizarre. We saw 3 of these things within 30mins, in 3 different towns. All in the same vinicity. I do not think it was a plane. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
