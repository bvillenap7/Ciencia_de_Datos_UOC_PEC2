At 22:31 on Monday April 17, 2006 in Hartford, CT 06120 over the Meadows there appeared to be a Teardrop or Pear shaped object traveling at an unusually slow rate of speed. The object seemed to moving in an eastbound direction at an altitude of approximately 12,000 feet. As a pilot, single engine VFR, I am certain this was neither an airplane nor helicopter. No lights appeared on the object although the entire surface structure appeared to glow a pale blue. Trailing behind the object was a hazy contrail which did not drift despite a strong northerly wind. The object appeared above the meadows for approximately two minutes. Inquiries to both Bradley Air Traffic Control and Brainard Air Traffice Control confirmed that there was no air traffic in the sky at that time to account for this object.;41.7628375000001;-72.6865798076924
