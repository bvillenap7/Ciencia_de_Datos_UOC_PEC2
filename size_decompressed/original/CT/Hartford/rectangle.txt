A huge, dark, rectangular craft in CT.;1992-11-06 22:35:00;8 minutes;A huge, dark, rectangular craft in CT. I enjoy looking at the night sky when I noticed stars disappearing.  Quickly realized there was a dark silhouette and rectangular craft, the size of a football field traveling slowly from left to right.  No sound at all!  Altitude had to be at least 20,000 feet high.  It had a slow pulsating red light in the bottom-center of craft.  It was traveling towards CT River/East Hartford.   I remember there used to be a Marines barrack not too far near Brainard Airport.  It's no longer there.;41.7628375000001;-72.6865798076924
