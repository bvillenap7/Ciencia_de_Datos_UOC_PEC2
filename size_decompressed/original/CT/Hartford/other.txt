Today is Saturday may 17 on 04/25/2008 around 4 or 5 in the afternoon i was in my house walking from the kitchen to the living room i notice my son was in the window so i looked to the window but walking at the same time, and then i saw something in the sky a block away from my apartmentI thought it was just my imagination it was silver round object but it looked blurry from where i was standing i looked back real fast it was still there but for some reason i kept walking to the living room but in a second my son scream saying mami you seen that?...i ask...what? and he said  the flying thing in the sky it was there and then it left real fast.So i ran to the window and nothing was there, only a small trail of smoke like the smoke the plane lives behind, but real short trail, like if what was there elevating and then puff!!! it left real fast.I wish i had my camera next to me.   But then 3 days ago from now May 14 2008 i was in the living room and it just started to get dark i look out the window and i thought i saw something in the sky so i grab my camera and took 3 picture the first one you can tell i was nervous the picture is a little sideway then i took the second one and there it was the same thing i saw in april 25 and my son out the kitchen window.i saw the light so i took the picture real fast.It was round but pointy at the end with glow.Im not sure if what i saw it was a omni but it got me thinking. i would like for somebody to see the pictures.
