UFO in Hartford, Connecticut.  Are they watching us???;2011-06-09 03:30:00;19 seconds;UFO in Hartford, Connecticut.  Are they watching us??? The event happened June 9, 2011, between 3:30 and 4:30 pm in Hartford Connecticut.  It was the day 150,000 people lost power in Connecticut do to a powerful storm that headed west to east with no tornados but many cloud rotations. During this time I was home sitting watching Channel 8 CT News listening to the load crackling of the thunder.   As the newscaster is talking the video focuses on the city of Hartford.  The camera shot is showing the tops of the buildings, traffic and the dark clouds.   In those dark clouds I noticed Lights and a figure of an object, but these lights did not belong.  In a storm like this I thought to myself, There should be no air traffic.    Thanks to my DVR I was able to rewind and go back to see it for a second, third, fourth and fifth time what was that I saw.  To my amazement I thought to myself,  This is an unidentified flying object.    Check it out for yourself and you decide.  If you go to this web site  http://www.wtnh.com/dpp/weather/severe_weather/severe-weather-whips-through-state#?CMP=201106_emailshare    Below will show a list of 7 Videos to be exact choose the fifth video and fast forward to the time 1:00 into the video, in the top right corner of the video you will notice an object admitting lights.   I witnessed a total of 6 lights at this time.  The object is in the frame for about a total of 2-3 seconds just hovering. Could this have been a reflection off the glass?   I don’t think so.   Now this isn’t the end of it so keep watching.    At the time of the video 1:15, lights in the shape of a triangle (3 lights) and a square (4 lights) will appear in the sky maybe 100 yards away from the first sighting.  These lights showing all the way threw to 1:19.  Could it be lightning that lasted a whole 4 seconds? I still don’t think so. Anyone that sees this video please respond to me.  I would love to hear what your thoughts are on the video.  With all these sightings happening now day’s will we get some closure soon?  I hope so…  Thanks Mr. ((initial deleted));41.7628375000001;-72.6865798076924

Three green lights appeared in our high level building apartment.;2013-03-09 02:30:00;10 seconds;Three green lights appeared in our high level building apartment. 3 green lights appeared inside our apartment which is above 10th floor.  They appeared on the side wall next to window and strangely moved to inside wall and repeated 2 times and then disappeared.  We have a balcony, so its not possible any light or laser beams could reach above 10th floor from ground level and there aren't other high buildings around.

I saw a bright white “star like” thing in the sky. It was NOT moving. While watching TV I noticed a bright light out the front door.  After a few minutes I went and got a pair of binoculars to observe the light.  This light was in the western sky and appeared to slightly change shapes.  My wife came and observed the light and we both went outside for a better look.  This bright light also had smaller/dimmer lights that changed from white to red to green from time to time.  We then got into our truck and drove 1 mile to the town green to get a better view point and observed this light for approx. 20 mins before going back home.  When we arrived home the light was still in the same spot until approx. 3-4 minutes later when we noticed it slowly moving north before disappearing past a neighbor's house.;41.7628375000001;-72.6865798076924
