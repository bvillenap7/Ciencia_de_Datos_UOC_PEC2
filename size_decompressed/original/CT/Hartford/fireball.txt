fireball at night went under car on highway.;1983-08-15 21:00:00;seconds;fireball at night went under car on highway. At night I was driving north on I-91 near Hartford, CT.  It was a hot night, probably in July or August.  All of a sudden a small fireball appeared to the left of the car, as if having fallen from the sky.  It landed on the road near my car and must have rolled under my car.  My friend screamed, What the H**** was that?  I was scared that it would ignite the gas in the tank and make the car catch fire.  That's all we saw of it, even though I looked in the rear view mirror to see where it went.  We never had any explanation of this except that maybe it was a meteorite.

Several orange objects seen in sky;2019-09-30 21:14:00;5 minutes;Several orange objects seen in sky Fiery Objects In Hartford, Ct.  9/30/2019 After arriving home at 9:10pm (now out of my vehicle), I observed an unusual object flying north-east over the downtown area in Hartford. Suddenly out of the corner of my eye, another object (fiery orange) coming from the south-west, came into view.  I looked around to see if anyone else was seeing this. There was a man and woman also looking at the object. The object followed the same path as the first. At that point, I took out my cellphone and began taking photos and video.  Subsequently, 7 more of the fiery orange objects followed in the same manner. The man asked if I thought it were balloons? I thought that it might be, but they seem to gain ground on the previous orb. It took about three to five minutes for the event to end.  Thank you for your consideration, VW;41.7628375000001;-72.6865798076924

It’s was hurling across the sky in a speed I’ve never seen before leaving a trail blazing behind it.  The object appeared green like a gas like green glow was around it and I eventually saw it disenegrate as the atmospheric pressure could have caused that.  My friend and I were in shock and had never seen anything like it.  There were no posts, nothing from NASA, just nothing that was bringing up the potential sighting of this object.  It was unreal.;41.7628375000001;-72.6865798076924
