Tonight, I saw a bright white circle, so bright, it can blind you going so slow in a soft gliding way for about 2 minutes it came so close to an airplane and than it disappeared.  Normally when a plane flies away from you the lights fade away.  Not this object it was like a flying glowing mirror and after it encountered the plane it faded away.  I went back in and than when I went out 3 minutes later I saw a fighter jet circling the area the aircraft flew by.  Not only that I started to see more airplanes in the area the object flew by.  I think the government might of been contacted to check this out.;41.7628375000001;-72.6865798076924
