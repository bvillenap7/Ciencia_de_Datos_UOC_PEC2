My friend and I were swimming in my  parents pool at 10:30pm on a very warm July night . We had been swimming for about an hour.  I looked up and saw a large triangle craft fly aprox 3000 feet above us. It was very large in size 300 feet across. It has 5 rings on the bottom that glowed yellow. It had to be going mach 3+. Made no sound and did maneuvers that an airplane can't do. It went from right to left.  I believe that it was one of our own craft. The craft know as the TR3B. The still classified replacement for the SR 71 Blackbird plane. It had no markings on it and no identifiable seems on the metal. These craft have been seen all over the world. My parents live 5 miles from a Navy base. I remember this event like it happened yesterday;41.4285;-72.0617
