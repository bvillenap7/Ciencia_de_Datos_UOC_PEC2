Erratic-moving amber light in sky;2004-01-10 19:15:00;about 15 min;Erratic-moving amber light in sky Around 7:15 p.m., I observed a light in the sky which at first I thought was a star.  Upon closer observation, I noticed that it was moving.  It appeared in the north/western sky and was amber in color.  It moved back and forth and up and down in an erratic pattern.  I was not sure what I was seeing so I called my husband upstairs to observe it.  He thought it was a helicopter or plane, but the lights did not really appear to blink and I have never seen either of those aircrafts move like this one did.  My husband lost interest and returned to watch the playoff game downstairs.  I stayed and decided to get a better look from by porch.  While I was outside, the light slowly started to descend out of my view, down past the tree line.  I live up on a hill off of Route 63.  This light appeared to be near/over Route 8, but I could be wrong, because it was so far away.  Both my husband and I are educated and normal people who do not give much notice to these sorts of things.  If anyone else has noticed this light, I'd love to see your comments.;41.4939;-73.0517
Amber light.;2013-11-02 23:30:00;2 minutes;I observed an amber light heading in my direction (northbound).  The light seemed to gradually intensify slightly, and fade slightly, dissimilar to the flashing lights of typical aircraft.  This is what caught my attention.  It stopped for a few moments, approximately half a minute, and remained stationary.  It was far away, but I listened for helicopter sounds which I did not hear.   It seemed to begin moving away, as the light faded, and then disappeared.   There were clouds in the sky, but it seemed as though the light was below the clouds.;41.4939;-73.0517

Some were so far away they looked like stars, but we had watched them come up from the southwest and fly east and slightly north.  They  could have been surveillance drones, but wow... that's all I can say ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous provides little contact information.  PD));41.4939;-73.0517

The light was traveling in my direction and flew in a east to west path.  As it passed over my house I could clearly see its shape.  It look like a ball of light with rope like appendages hanging from the ball of light.  The entire thing emitted a very bright white slightly bluish light.  There was no sound no exhaust and no trail.  It like floated across the sky. A short time later approximately a half an hour a very large very loud helicopter with a spotlight on the front flew over my house in the same direction the UFO went.;41.4939;-73.0517
