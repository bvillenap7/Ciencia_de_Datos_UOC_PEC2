Silent;2013-07-04 21:15:00;45 seconds;Mufti sided grey craft with pinkish red smaller illumination off center. Looked like a flare. Heading due north. Silent At first it looked like a flare or a firework. Since to the 4th of July I expected it to be a falling firework but it didn't burn out and kept  on moving forward. It was pinkish red like a flare. It traveled across the sky and I lost sight of it only when it went behind the trees. When I caught the next glimpse of it I was able to see the actual craft. It was silent in the night sky. I grabbed my camera but by the time I realized it wasn't a firework it was too late as it was already heading behind the trees and I couldn't get a shot of it. I wasn't sure what it was until I was able to see the craft itself. A grayish 5 or 6 sided craft heading due north.;41.4939;-73.0517
