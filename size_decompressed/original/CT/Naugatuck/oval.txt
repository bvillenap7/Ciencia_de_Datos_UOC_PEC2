Small black oval object, flew over condominium in Naugatuck, CT.  ((anonymous report));2019-04-24 17:30:00;2 minutes;Small black oval object, flew over condominium in Naugatuck, CT I went outside with my dog.  It was sunny with few clouds.  The time was 17:30. I heard a helicopter, and looked up.  A white helicopter with two rotors was going overhead.  The helicopter was very low I would estimate 150 feet off the ground.  There were no markings on the helicopter.  As I looked at the white copter a black oval object flew into my view.  The object was small maybe six feet in length.  I could see the sun glinting off of this object.  The object flew directly at the white helicopter.  I thought that it would collide with it. At the last moment the object veered away. It flew east up over the other building in our condominium complex then quickly veered south towards the Naugatuck State Forest at great speed.  I continued down the hill with my dog to the end of our road.  At that point, an unmarked single rotor black helicopter flew towards the Naugatuck State Forest following the path of the object.
