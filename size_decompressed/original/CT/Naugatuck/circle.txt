They abruptly stopped due to malfunction.  We were in the hills of Naugatuck, ct. we decided to start walking home after about 5 min because they were short and hadn’t known at the time what happened.  In the sky we seen a glowing object we thought was a drown but was moving quick.  It was circling around and around.  Then stopped where I was able to pull out my phone camera and record.  I recorded for 15 seconds until my battery was dying I looked down for one second and heard everyone on the street screaming, “did you see that”.  It became really bright white and then streaked in the sky and disappeared.  Amazing.  If you zoom into the video you can see the energy around it.   Very cool night.  The kids were crying they were very shaken up.  The colors didn’t get on video but was orange red and purple white and blue.;41.4939;-73.0517
