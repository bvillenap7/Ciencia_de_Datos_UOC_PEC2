Green light travelling at extreme speed over Groton, CT;2005-11-27 23:30:00;10 seconds;Green light travelling at extreme speed over Groton, CT I was driving east on I-95 by Waterford/New London, CT.  In front of me I saw a bright green light in the sky, as it appeared, hoovering over Groton, CT on the far side of the Thames river, north of I-95, a couple of miles ahead of us.  The light wasn't very high from the ground, as it appeared not too far from the tree line sillouette.  The light was bigger than I could associate with any aircraft, so I told my wife to watch it too.  As I told her this, the green light started to move, as it appeared, in an eastern direction, parallell to I-95.  Suddenly the the light seemed to accelerate to extreme speed as it quickly vanished towards the east.  This is when I realized I have witnessed something extraordinary.  My wife failed to notice the object, so I was left with my own experience, which lasted no more than a couple of seconds.;41.3625;-72.0449
Bright light, too low to be a satellite, hovers 10 mins. then abruptly disappears. watched with binocs.;2010-06-01 04:00:00;15 minutes;Bright light, too low to be a satellite, hovers 10 mins. then abruptly disappears. watched with binocs. June first, 2010. Groton Long Point, CT.  I was sitting on the porch of my parent’s home directly on the shore  of Fisher’s Island Sound, unable to sleep (for personal reasons).  It was a perfectly peaceful, clear, quiet night (a.m.) I noticed a bright light hovering over the waters of what looked to be just outside of Stonington harbor (could have been more like Watch Hill, hard to tell).   At first, I thought it must be a heli, but there was no sound, and it did not move for ten minutes.  I have seen the satellites way up in space, this was at heli level.  Obviously, it was not a plane, because it wasn’t moving. I was curious enough after 5 minutes of hovering to get the binocs out.  I watched through them for the next 5 minutes, then it seemed to spin (I saw a second light) and then quickly disappear towards Rhode Island,  I watched it through the binocs till I couldn’t see it anymore (probably took about 30 secs.  For it to disappear.)    I was so blown away, and bummed that I was the only one in the household that actually saw it.  Surprised there aren’t any other reports of that sighting, though it was rather late (or early).    Please let me know if anyone else saw this!  I know what I saw.;41.3625;-72.0449
Two blinking light;2011-02-03 17:40:00;10;Two blinking light around 5:40 pm I saw 2 blinking light with similar distance but couldn't see any object.  These lights were moving fast speed towards eastern Connecticut.  but I am sure it was not a plane.;41.3625;-72.0449
Red, orange and sometimes blue lights zipping around in the sky, vertical, horizontal, sometimes swinging - seem to follow each other.;2011-02-05 01:00:00;51 mins. so far;Red, orange and sometimes blue lights zipping around in the sky, vertical, horizontal, sometimes swinging - seem to follow each other. We are seeing strange lights in the sky that seemingly come closer, then move further away.  There are three lights. One red, one orange and one blue.  They moved strangly, up and down, sideways and swinging back and forth at times.  They are zipping accross the sky, sometimes disappearing and then they come back. Now, there are four! I don't know what to make of it.  They don't behave like aircraft and they move so quickly that I can't imagine that they are satalites.  Just odd, so I thought I'd report it.  It was first noticed by my 14 year old daughter, and she called me to look.  I saw it too, as did my 17 year old daughter.  I really don't want to end up on the news, so I'm not comfortable leaving my name or contact info. Our home is on the right side of the street from the intersection of Gold Star Hwy. and Great Brook Road, and we were looking at the sky from our front windows - towards the base. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  Possible sighting of Sirius, we suspect.  PD));41.3625;-72.0449
