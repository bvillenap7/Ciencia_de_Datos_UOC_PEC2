Saw a semi circle of bright lights hovering in the distance. Vantage point was standing on our back porch looking towards Long Island Sound with no city or residences between us and the ocean. The object hovered for 3 minutes. It then appeared to come closer to the house. Then it spun around or did some sort of acrobatics and disappeared. After this we waited for an hour and it didnâ€™t come back.;41.3625;-72.0449
Small shiny object seen in sky while driving on clear day, looked back for a 3rd time and it was gone.;2011-10-10 15:00:00;Less than 5 seconds;Small shiny object seen in sky while driving on clear day, looked back for a 3rd time and it was gone. Today on 10/10/11 at aprox. 3:00pm EST, I saw to what I believed was a small circular or disk shaped object hovering in the sky.  I was traveling alone on I-95 southbound near exit 88 when I saw it. It was a completely cloudless sky and I was traveling at 70mph.   I looked up to see a small shiny object, about 2000 to 3000 ft in the air and was probably the size of a school bus or perhaps even a small plane.  I was looking out my front windshield and off a bit to the right, which would have put the object to my northeast.  It caught my attention due to the fact it was extremely shiny.. more shiny than anything I had ever seen on a plane flying across the sky.   I looked back a second time after I had glanced down at the road while driving to see if it was still there.  It had not moved at all, which I thought was odd if it were a bird, plane or even maybe balloon.  I looked back down at the road again to drive, and looking up again a 3rd time, the object was no longer! in sight.  I thought if it was a balloon, it would be moving slowly enough where even at my speed, given the altitude of the object it should still have been visible.  I did not think it was a commercial plane due to the fact I did not notice any landing gear, windows, engines, fuselage or wings.   I can't say for certain that it was not a reflection of some sort, but I thought it worthy enough to report it. No other witnesses were present. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he seemed to us to be a sincere, and sober-minded, individual.  We suspect that he is a very good witness.  PD));41.3625;-72.0449
