Two teardrod like shapes came out of the edge of the sky, they where like slow moving stars or comets or something, whitish blue. The lights in my house began to dim in and out for a short time then they both stopped dead, stood for a second,emitting a small glow, and took off in a hard angle in the opposite direction, faster than i could see leaving a streak of light blue light.;41.3625;-72.0449
