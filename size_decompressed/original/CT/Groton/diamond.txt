High in the atmosphere a glowing diamond shaped object appeared over the Northern sky in Groton, CT. around the time and date noted. The object also seemed to have an illuminating red ball that lit up every five minutes or so lasting for a few seconds.  The event was witnessed first by one member, than another and finally one more who took a more closer look at the object through a telescope. His findings were that the object had to be a star that was close?  Upon trying to find the object minutes later in a sky that had too much clearance for anything to have had disappeared that quick, and knowing it could not have been a satellite, or airplane, the only conclusion is that it was something flying that was unidentified...
