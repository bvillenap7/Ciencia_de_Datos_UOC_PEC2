On I-95 N, to my right, out above the water, I saw a row of 5 hook shaped contrails.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sky writing aircraft.  PD));2017-07-16 13:00:00;15 minutes;I was traveling on I-95 north through CT.  To my right, out above the water, I saw a row of 5 hook-shaped contrails appearing from nowhere.  I watched for a couple of minutes as they traveled by me.  I then thought to grab some pictures with my iPhone 7. These contrails appeared to be about a 1/4 mile across.  The row of 5 appeared exactly at the same time.  The would stop, or skip, periodically in no apparent pattern.  They would then suddenly begin again.  They ended up moving away from to where I could no longer see them appear. I have seen airline contrails in the past.  Even the highest planes were still visible.  The contrails were always one continuous line of vapor.  These today seemed to pulse.  All 5 across appearing from nowhere.   You can reach me at ((e-address deleted)) or 484-((telephone number deleted)).  I have video and photos. ((NUFORC Note:  The high-quality photos provided by the witness indicate to us that the contrails probably were formed by five sky writing aircraft, flying abreast.  Not a UFO.
