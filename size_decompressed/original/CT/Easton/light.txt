((Starlink satellites));2020-03-26 05:55:00;10 minutes;At approximately 5:55am EST this morning (3/26/20) I was exiting my house and looked up in the sky.  Traveling from the SW to the NE in perfect formation, as if being pulled by a string, I saw over 30+ white lights in the sky moving at casual pace.  I witnessed the 2nd craft in line pull next to the first the reverse back in formation.  These were not satellites (too low but high enough in the sky).  I DID NOT hear any noise coming from these objects. When it FINALLY got to the end, the last light (object) was slightly distanced from the rest of the lights.  PLEASE tell me others in my area (EASTON, CT) saw this!!!;41.2515;-73.2862
