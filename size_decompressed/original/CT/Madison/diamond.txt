Pulsating Diamond;2010-08-27 22:17:00;20 seconds;Pulsating Diamond On the night of Friday 27-Aug-2010 at 2217hrs my wife and I along with another couple and the children were setting up our campsite at the Hammonasset State Park in Madison CT. My wife said to everyone look at that! we all turned to the southeast and witnessed a diamond shaped object pulsating red/orange moving slowly to the northeast, I was able to take a compass bearing on the object of 150*. I referenced the object with two pine trees at a range of approximatley 100m across a flat open field the object was situated at an elevation equivelant to two horizontal fingerwidths above the two pine trees the object steadily moved to a bearing of 120* paused for approximatley 2 seconds and then rapidly ascended to the east at a high angle of ascent and disapeared out of site. The weather was as follows: Skies-clear with abundent stars visible and the moon was a wanning gibbous providing significant lighting, enough so that I would expect an exhaust/vapor trail t! o be visible , Winds-Calm, Temperature-Approximatlety 60*F, Humidity-Low. The object made no noise, there was no trail of exhaust/vapor visible. I did not notice any aircraft in the area at the time of the sighting. I called the NUFORC hotline to report shortly after the incident occured. As we were in the process of setting up camp a camera was not readily accessible and I did not want to take my eyes off of the object. My exact location at the time of the incident was 41* 16'21.7N 72* 35'51.1W.;41.3089;-72.619
