Mistaken sighting for two stars in the eastern sky just before sunrise.  ((NUFORC Note:  Jupiter and Venus??  PD));2014-08-18 04:15:00;45 minutes;Mistaken sighting for two stars (sic.  Planets?) in the eastern sky just before sunrise. I had made a report of a sighting  in Madison, Connecticut on the 18 of this month.  Sorry to say it was 2 stars in the eastern sky.   The other sighting earlier in the year was for sure a real sighting.  Guess I am hoping for another sighting as grand as the first one.  Sorry to bother you with a false sighting.;41.3089;-72.619
THERE IS SOMETHING OUT THERE WATCHING US. OBSERVING THIS PLANET.  ((NUFORC Note:  Jupiter & Venus.  PD));2014-08-18 04:15:00;45 minutes;THERE IS SOMETHING OUT THERE WATCHING US. OBSERVING THIS PLANET WHILE DELIVERING MY MORNING PAPERS LIKE I DO EVERY MORNING.  I HAD WITNESSED A OBJECT IN THE LOW HORIZON.  SEEMED TO BE TWO LIGHTS ONE BIGGER THAN THE OTHER.  ATTEMPTED TO VIDEO THE SITE BUT DID NOT PICK UP THE IMAGE.   I DID TAKE PHOTOS AS WELL.  BECAUSE OF THE PHONE I USED ITS JUST A BLUR WHEN ZOOMED IN ON. THIS OBJECT DID NOT MOVE NO NOISE AND OBSERVED IT FOR AWHILE .  I STILL HAD A JOB TO DO SO I TRIED TO KEEP AN EYE ON IT FROM TIME TO TIME .IT DID NOT MOVE IT REMAINED IN THE SAME POSITION SO IT WAS NOT A STAR THAT I KNOW OF IN THAT PART OF THE SKY.  IT WAS VISIBLE TILL SUN UP .   I CAN SWEAR THAT I DID SEE WHAT APPEARED TO BE A SILVERY CLOUD SHAPE AFTER SUNRISE.  IT WAS STILL IN THE VERY SAME PLACE AS WHEN I FIRST SAW IT.  I HAVE HAD A SEEN A ANOTHER OBJECT BEFORE AWHILE BACK BUT WAS MUCH FARTHER AWAY AND IN ANOTHER POSITION IN THE SKY AND THAT ONE WAS MOVING AROUND.  I BELIEVE THAT I HAD THREE SIGHTING THAT I CANNOT EXPLAIN.FUNNY THING IS NO ONE ELSE SEEMS TO HAVE WITNESSED THIS.   WERE NOT ALONG HERE AND WHO EVER THEY ARE SEEM TO OUTSMART OUR RADAR I GUESS .  HAS MUCH TO DO WITH THE SHAPE OF THE CRAFT I THINK. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness corrects his conclusion about the sighting.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Mistaken sighting for two stars (sic.
