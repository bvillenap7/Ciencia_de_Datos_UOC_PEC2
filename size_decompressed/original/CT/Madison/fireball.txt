Orange Glowing Fireball moved South, then North, then disappeared.;2013-08-03 00:18:00;10 minutes;Orange Glowing Fireball moved South, then North, then disappeared. We were watching neighbors with fireworks when we noticed, very high up in the sky over the Long Island Sound, a white moving object.  I said Look, it's a UFO and all of a sudden, the orange fireball came down toward us so we could have a good look at it!   It sounds strange, but I thought it heard me!   We were amazed and also kind of scared.  It hovered about and then eventually moved north in the sky to fade away.;41.3089;-72.619
Another fireball sighting in the sky maybe two.;2014-08-24 03:00:00;15:00;another fireball sighting in the sky maybe two . was going to work at three in the morning . at my back stairs i looked up and saw a streak of light.  At that time also saw a jet flying in almost in the same direction.  Looking just above the tree line observed a fireball shaped thing.  It moved around in many directions . up, down, speed off sideways at a very fast speed than return to same spot and hover moving around just a little bit.   I am seeing a pattern forming here.  Seems that these objects appear while there is no moon.  I have tried to video this but lack the proper video tools to document what is going on here . this is a real case and should not be ignored.  I have seen this once before.  Same craft same area just about.;41.3089;-72.619
