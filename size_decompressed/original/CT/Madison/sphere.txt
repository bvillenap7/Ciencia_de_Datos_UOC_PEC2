Flat hourglass shaped  black craft off the top floor of a high rise hotel. While sitting on the beach in Madison CT I saw what appeared to be a shooting start.  10 minutes later I saw trees in the distance being luminated.  10 minutes after that a sphere approx. 3 feet in diameter and glowing with an egg shell color.  It slowly traced the shoreline over approx. 100 feet for several minutes.  It then shot inland at a very high speed with little more than a slight whoosh.  15 minutes later it returned to the same spot. After several minutes of shoreline tracing it seemed to lose control, traced out a 5 point star pattern, each leg being about 50 feet in length and crashed into the water about 50 feet off the shoreline where it broke open. Inside was what appeared to be a fiber optic looking cable bunch about 4 or 5 inches in diameter. Wall thickness appeared to be 1/4 to 1/2 inch, smooth inside and out. It floated on the water for about 10 minutes still glowing. After 10 minutes it slowly dimmed and sank. In the summer 1981 in Datona Beach I saw an object shaped like a fat flat hour glass on a disk.  It appeared black against the clouds and sat right outside the top floor of a high rise hotel.  10 or 15 seconds after I saw it, it made a made a very high speed assent into the clouds in a long lazy S shape. I would be interested in finding out if anyone else had seen either of these sightings. Thanks,((name deleted));41.3089;-72.619
A strange round cloud with a trail behind it.;2019-02-06 06:38:00;20 minutes;I was walking my dog on Middlebeach Road around 6:00am this morning, when I noticed what appeared to be a strange round cloud with a trail behind it.  It appeared to to be leaving a trail behind it.  It stood out because in the Eastern sky, the sun was rising and I had just taken a few Photos and videos of sunrise.  It was 29 degrees, under partly cloudy skies .   A man happened to be jogging by me while I was seeing this and I stopped him to ask him what he thought it was.  He was as perplexed as I was.  I continued to photograph the object.  It appeared to move extremely slowly and was leaving a cloud like trail behind it.  There were no lights.  There was no sound other than the sound of the water and at times I would seem to blend into the sky and then reappear.  I would put the object somewhere over Long Island sound or over Nassau County, NY.  I have at least 30 still shots taken with iPhone 10s Plus 256. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he seemed to us to be quite sober-minded and eloquent.  He occupies a very responsible job, and we suspect he is an exceptionally qualified, and reliable, witness.  PD));41.3089;-72.619
