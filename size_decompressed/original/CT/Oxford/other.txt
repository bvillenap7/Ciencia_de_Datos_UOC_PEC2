Gentleman phones air traffic control tower to inquire as to what he saw.;2008-01-27 11:35:00;less than 1 min.;Gentleman phones air traffic control tower to inquire as to what he saw. First, I need to stress the following:  I AM NOT THE WITNESS OF THIS EVENT.  I am an air traffic controller relaying vague information collected by a caller who contacted me during my shift.  The caller reported seeing a balloon shaped object passing directly over the runway at the airport where I work.  The caller estimated the object to be at 2,000 ft., flying from north to south.  Given what was told, I attempted to locate the object in the sky to the south.  I was unable to do so.  I saw nothing.  I contacted another air traffic facility one equipped with radar.  I explained to them what had been reported and asked them if they saw anything to the south of the airport that might account for this.  The replied in the negative.  Additionally, a pilot who landed approximately 10-15 minutes after the call reported seeing nothing abnormal while flying to the airport.;41.4186;-73.1275
