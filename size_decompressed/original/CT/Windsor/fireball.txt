Bus sized fireball object over 91 about 3-400 ft up going about 150 mph at a downward 20 degree angle.;2010-10-10 20:20:00;5 seconds;bus sized fireball object over 91 about 3-400 ft up going about 150 mph at a downward 20 degree angle Driving north on I-91 before the Bissel bridge exit around this date and time when I clearly seen a  reddish orange fireball about the size of a city bus traveling about 150-200 mph going west and was about 3-500 feet high and was traveling slightly downward.   I was so amazed that I was looking at the cars passengers next to me and pointing towards it but I couldn't tell if they had seen it.  I was so certain as to what I saw I almost drove to the area where it may have touched down.  I thought it was an airplane engine because of the slow speed but was too big.   I was going to call the area police but I didn't want to sound like a joker.  I was watching the news certain that many others saw it and called it in or it was some plane debris that crashed.  I found this website on 4/14 so I don't remember the exact date.  I've seen all kinds of fireworks ,planes ,meteors and this thing was like a school bus sized object engulfed in fire traveling fairly slow and was only about 1-2 miles away and could see it clearly and for about 4-5 seconds.   After over five years later I still remember like it was yesterday.  With all the radio controlled aircraft's today there are probably a lot of ufo hoaxers but this was way too big to be one and I'm sure I wasn't hallucinating or exaggerating.  Also I am very surprised that it wasn't on the news or reported elsewhere.;41.85575;-72.6545999999999
