I was on an on ramp to get onto 91 south in the Windsor Locks area and I saw a flat dark disk with two bright lights on it.  I initially thought it was an airplane however when I pulled my car over to take a longer look it had disappeared.  There were no trees or faulty sight lines blocking it--it was too high up in the air.   It disappeared in less than ten seconds.;41.85575;-72.6545999999999
