Shite stationary spot plane nearing.;2012-11-23 15:30:00;20 seconds;White stationary spot/ plane nearing Typically a late morning commuter to Windsor CT (via  91 N or 202 through Simsbury CT), several planes trailing in the otherwise blue skies are now a norm to see albeit odd seeming.  They seem more prevalent than in years past but have been chalking it up to personal exposure to more open skies as summertime was spent kayaking several CT lakes/rivers and new commute toWindsor. This Friday afternoon around 3:30 pm,  traveling E on DayHill Road to stop for coffee, viewed 5 plane trails and 2 active planes in the clear blue sky.  As I stopped at a red light, I observed one plane traveling nearly vertical on the left side of the moon.  The 2nd active plane trailing captured my eye as it was so high and juxtaposed to the daytime-visible moon it actually trailed directly in front of the moon.  The former photographer in me longed for an SLR camera to capture it.  As I watched it traveling left to right over the moon,  to itâ€™s right was a white spot in the sky that made me look longer.  The spot seemed to just hang in the air, like a hot air balloon but no possible hot air balloon would (could) be so high.  It did not appear to be traveling like a plane would through the sky, but just hanging there.  And as quickly as I noticed it, it was no longer visible.

Red flashing light in sky above Windsor Connecticut;2013-08-05 04:40:00;1 minute;Red flashing light in sky above Windsor Connecticut I was taking out the trash at around 4:40 am. Looked up at the sky and saw a singular flashing red light holding a steady pattern.  It seemed to travel across the sky holding a constant speed.  I stared at it for about 40 seconds trying to see if I could see any additional lights to discern it to be an airplane, but when I realized that it was the only blinking light I knew what I was looking at was very strange.  I turned my back to get my sister from inside and as I stepped onto the porch about 20 feet away I looked back and it had vanished from sight.;41.85575;-72.6545999999999
