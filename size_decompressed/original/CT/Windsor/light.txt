Extremely bright white light in early a.m. sky;2018-12-19 06:00:00;30 minutes;Extremely bright white light in early a.m. sky 6:00 a.m. eastern sky, watched what appeared to be a drone? but the bright white light was far too bright and high in sky.  At first notice, was well above tree line then it started climbing in elevation straight up into sky.  I researched information online on what it could be, could be a comet.  I do not believe it is extraterrestrial.  Venus and Mercury converge on this day, but movement is unlike planetary orbit.;41.85575;-72.6545999999999

I was star gazing with my boyfriend in his front yard and out of no where there was this giant orb of light in the sky. At first we though it was a shooting star or a satellite but then it started to move in a zigzag across the sky really fast. After a few seconds it was gone.;41.85575;-72.6545999999999
