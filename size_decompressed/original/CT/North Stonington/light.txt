Strange Lights and booming noises in North Stonington CT;2010-01-20 18:00:00;20 Minutes;Strange Lights and booming noises in North Stonington CT On about 6 PM last night I had just arrived home and was preparing dinner, when my husband and I heard a very loud foreign noise outside.  We live within a 30 mile distance of an airport and see the aircraft flying over in a landing pattern nightly.  This was different.  It sounded as if the craft was going to land on the house.  I went outside to investigate.  Out back I saw something that was not like anything I had seen before it almost looked like it was taking cover in the clouds overhead.  The lights were very bright and moved in a pattern that a regular aircraft does not usually follow.  The second time we heard the noise it shook the whole house.  I went out the front door this time and again saw the bright lights they were flying east bound and then simply like putting a car in reverse headed back west bound.  As it came closer I could not only hear the rumble of the craft, but I could feel the sound.  My son being very scared again asked me to come in, and!  I did.  I went back out a few minutes later and there was nothing.;41.4582;-71.8724
