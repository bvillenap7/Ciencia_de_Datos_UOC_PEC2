It had one large white lamp at te front tip and two large white lamps at the rear corners giving the impression of triangle in shape. Between the rear lamps offset semi center was a red lamp that was blinking. The craft was flying very low altitude. The three main charcteristics that main this craft noticeable was the following: 1)Large white lamps (much larger than other craft) 2)One red blnking lamp no others on wing tips etc 3) Very low altitude and non commerial flight path  I have seen these before and each time it followed the same charcteristics. Very low to ground and neverin an area standard to personal or commerical aircraft.  Pictures and video have proved fruitless due to zoom capability and darkness.  The noise was near non exsistant considering the altiitude it was at.;41.9050458333333;-72.5589041666667
