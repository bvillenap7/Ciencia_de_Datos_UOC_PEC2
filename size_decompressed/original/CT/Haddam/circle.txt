Multi-colored flashing orbs in sky over Ct River.   ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a twinkling star sighting.  PD));2013-11-18 21:00:00;2 hours;multi-colored flashing orbs in sky over Ct River For the past 3 nights my family and I have noticed a ball with multi colored lights on it in the general vicinity of Haddam-East Haddam.   At first we thought it was a star but it was twinkling with different colors.  So we looked at them through a high powered sighting  scope used for hunting.  Upon looking through the scope we realized that they were more of a cage of vertical lights in red, green, white and blue.  The lights pulsate up in down.  Sometimes they altogether disappear minutes after viewing them.   This is not the first time we have seen them and at other times there are more than one, sometimes three. We have seen them at about the same time at night. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a twinkling star sighting.  PD));41.4652;-72.5069
