I than realized the light was brighter than surrounding stars, which caught my attention. When I focused on the light, I observed a row of horizontal bright lights next to each other.There were at least four bright lights. I focused on the lights and noticed it was hovering in one spot for at least 15-25 minutes. It seemed to move a little in all directions. I went to get my camera and it dissapeared from my view.;41.4652;-72.5069
