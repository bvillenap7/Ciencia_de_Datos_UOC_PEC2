Multiple zigzagging white objects far up in the sky;2010-04-04 16:00:00;5 minutes;Multiple zigzagging white objects far up in the sky I and my wife were enjoying the sun beside Pattaconk Lake in Cockaponset State Forest in Haddam, Connecticut this afternoon. At around 4 pm, while lying down on the grass,  I noticed 2 oblong objects floating way up in the sky. They were very very far up in the sky, almost at the middle of the sky. Initially I thought those may be floaters or some other illusion. However when I asked my wife if she can see the objects, she also could see them. and the number of the objects increased soon to 8-10. They appeared like white tadpoles zigzagging their way in the sky. Actually they remained in a small zone of the sky for a few minutes. Their movement seemed somewhat like Brownian motion. At some instances it seemed as if those were aircrafts performing some maneuvers. It was pretty difficult to track all of them as they were very small, and the sun was very bright. Amazingly they disappeared suddenly within 5-6 minutes. We could not follow any particular pathway or trajectory in which they went. They simply vanished. I do not know if they were some military crafts or some other technological stuff. but their appearance and disappearance were very sudden. I have never seen anything like this before.;41.4652;-72.5069
