One had a red/orange haze and had a tail. 2 others crossed paths a created a light prism I was hanging out with some friends. We were by a pond listening to music and I noticed I was having issues loading songs that weren’t downloaded.  I finally got a song to play  and I just happened to look up to look at the sky and saw one faint circle like object with a white light move.  I tried to point it out to one of my friends.  When I started to point in the direction of what I saw, he saw something fly right above us a little higher than tree level, I caught a glimpse of it and it had a tail trailing and a haze around it of a red/orange glow.  It continued its flight passed us but It was so low we assumed it landed.  We then saw another light cross paths with the original light we had seen.  A few seconds after, there was a beam of light in the sky coming from the direction of the two crossing lights that formed a rectangular prism shape.  We were so shook we immediately left.  This all happened at Christiansen’s pond on Well Rd.;41.9609;-72.7957
