Bright stationary oval in western sky, changing from white to red to greenish blue, no noise at all, dogs barking in neighborhood;2002-09-08 20:30:00;3 to 5 minutes;Bright stationary oval in western sky, changing from white to red to greenish blue, no noise at all, dogs barking in neighborhood I was taking out the trash and I heard dogs barking like carzy, I looked over across to the neighbors back yard and there was a bright oval in the sky, it was changing color slowly from white to red to greenish blue, I sat there and watched in amazement for about 5 minutes, then it got really really dim, I waited a few seconds, it got at least twice as bright as it was and then it just dissapered. It sat quite a bit above the horrizon. It didnt make any noise at all, it just was gone. I have a solid background in aircraft knowledge and this is not like anything I have ever seen before. It didnt move at all throughout the whole incident, it stayed completely stationary.;41.9609;-72.7957
