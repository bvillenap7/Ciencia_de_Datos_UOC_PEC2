Green sphere/ball of light that moved quickly, it appeared quickly and vanished quickly..;2008-06-17 22:00:00;6 seconds;Green sphere/ball of light that moved quickly, it appeared quickly and vanished quickly.. This event had occurred very quickly, I still get the chills thinking about what I saw.  This object was a ball of light. It was almost like a spot light.  I thought it was a spot light for about a hot second then I realized it was not.   This ball of light was a heavy light green color.  It was above these tall pine trees behind my neighbors house.  This sphere of light moved very quickly.  It moved left to right fast then it didn’t move for about 2 seconds then it moved very quickly to the side and was gone.  It was the size of a big beach ball only except it was a ball of light that was dark green and it was bright, but not to bright.   I waited and watched for it to happen again but it didn’t.  I wish I knew what it was but it happened so quickly and long ago. Its almost like it didn’t happen because my mind doesn’t want to accept it.  It was unreal and fast, but I know what I saw.

between 6-8 bright orange balls flying in formation, same flight path approx same altitude headed to Long Island;2009-07-04 22:00:00;5 mins;between 6-8 bright orange balls flying in formation, same flight path approx same altitude headed to Long Island On July 4th, 2009 from approximately 10pm and 10:05pm, myself, my wife and my 11 year old son witnessed several orange balls of light in the sky. They were heading in a southeasterly direction silently towards the ocean at about 30 mph. They were a brilliant orange in color and were the size of a quarter at arms length.	There was approximately 1000 feet between each of the orange “balls”. There was a slight altitude difference between one “ball” and the next but the distance separating each ball was the same. They were all generally flying on the same flight path. They kept coming one after the other and we estimate between 6 and 8 of the orange “balls”. I was able to snap 2 photos but no video because of a dead battery. 	After I had called my son and wife outside and they were able to see what I was seeing, I took my son with me in the car to try to get a closer look. As we were driving we saw the last one heading towards Long Island. I got out of my car and tried to get a photo but it was too late. Before the last one was out of sight, it seemed to get 2 to 3 times brighter and then just shoot off. 				These orange balls were first sighted in my backyard in West Haven, CT and we followed them about ½ mile to the West Haven shore before they headed out towards Long Island. I watch the sky almost every night and have never seen anything like this before. My wife was actually a little upset after seeing this. It was not fireworks or planes or helicopters, I’m absolutely sure. We just want to know what it was.;41.2686;-72.9651
