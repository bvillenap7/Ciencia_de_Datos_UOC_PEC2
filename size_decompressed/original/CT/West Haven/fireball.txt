bright green comet or unidentified object that appeared to crash into the Earth;2010-01-07 00:00:00;3-4 secs;bright green comet or unidentified object that appeared to crash into the Earth Tonight, I was looking out of my window to the Northwest and I saw what first appeared to be a plane crashing. The object was traveling from West to East and was North of West Haven.  As I continued to watch the object, it seemed as though it was going way too fast to be a plane crashing.  My second thought was that it was a comet or shooting star.  It had a tail similar a shooting star.  But  I have never seen a shooting star as close to the Earth or appear to crash in the distance like this did. As the object approached the horizon, The light went from a bright white to a much brighter green flying behind hills in the distance.  It appeared to have crashed several miles in the distance.  I would say that the size was much bigger than the largest star in the sky and the trail was about as wide as the moon.;41.2686;-72.9651

I noticed an object with what seemed to be trailing flames falling pretty quickly in the distance (over the Northern CT coast.)   I thought maybe it was a meteor but it didn't seem to be falling at the speed of gravity. The trailing flames disappeared and it seemed to hover for a while as a red light in the distance.  Eventually it disappeared into haze... it never landed or flew away.;41.2686;-72.9651
Fireballs in the sky.;2014-09-28 19:00:00;12 minutes;fireballs in the sky We saw two fire balls side by side, then two minutes two more fire balls side by side and then 2 minutes later a single fire ball then another and another.  A total of seven.  They were not that high and there was silence no sound of engines.  They all traveled the same exact route and then disappeared.;41.2686;-72.9651
