Flying disk;2006-07-18 14:30:00;6 seconds;flying disk i was laying in bed with my blinds up and all of a sudden i was starring at this fast moving object through my window it was just above my trees in the backyard moving at about 5 or 6 mph it was circular and very small.  i almost thought it was an electric R.C. or something but my neighbors were not outside and no one was around outside besides it was to high in the air. it was gray/silver small moved in a shaky fast circular motion and then it was gone vanishing behind the trees. the second i saw this i ran downstairs to tell my family what i just saw..they probably think i am crazy. i know what i saw and it was creepy ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
