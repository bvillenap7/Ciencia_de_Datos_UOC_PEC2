I was in my car, driving home from my office.  It was twilight, just beginning to grow dark, and I saw what appeared to be a star in the sky.  I remember thinking to myself that it seemed to early to start seeing stars, and that this one was not only early but strangely bright.  And then, when I stopped at a stop sign, I realized it was moving. My first thought was I had mistaken a plane for a star, but it occurred to me that most planes blink, or have red lights.  This was an extremely bright, steady white light.  It wasn't moving extraordinarily fast, but it was moving pretty fast.  I heard no sounds (other than my own car's engine, with the window down on such a hot night) so I grew more and more curious as to what it was. Then, as my car began moving again, it simply faded away and was gone.  It didn't simply blink out, but seemed to fade off as if it was on a dimmer switch.  I could see nothing but blue-ish, darkening sky.  No clouds.;41.2686;-72.9651
