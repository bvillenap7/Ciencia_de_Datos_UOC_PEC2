Slow moving red and yellow objects.;2013-08-28 07:50:00;5 minutes;Slow moving red and yellow objects. My wife and I saw two red and yellow objects moving very slowing, high in the sky.  They were larger than any star or planet from our vantage point.  Neither of us have ever seen anything like it.   At one point they seem to move away from us and then they slowly disappeared.   I've no explanation for it.;41.2981500000001;-73.4942078947368
