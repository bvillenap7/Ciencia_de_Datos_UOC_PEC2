I was standing on the platform facing roughly west/northwest in the Copps Hill plaza on route 35 and observed an intensely flashing light hovering over the hill at about the height of what could be an airplane beacon.  There is a nearby municipal airport and so such a light might easily be overlooked.  As I watched the light for 30 or 40 seconds(it was flashing an intense array of red, green, white, silvery, and blue) it eventually dimmed over the course of about 3 seconds and began to flash just reddish-yellow, and after another 2 or 3 seconds began to move at a steady pace towards what I assume to be the south or southwest of its position, eventually disappearing behind a far hill in the distance in Westchester County, New York State.  I have observed many such lights over the years, always in the west over the hills of Westchester and Putnum counties and always with a similar pattern.  The lights will always be completely stationary and intensely flashing man! y colors, then either blink out of existence abruptly or after glowing just one color(usually red), or over the course of perhaps half a second the light will suddenly zoom off and disappear in a short arc in the shape of a parabola (like x squared from the origin to like x=4, that shape) and I stress they are always relatively low over the western hills where someone that isn't watching could easily overlook. ((ADDENDUM FROM SOURCE OF REPORT)) Yes I realized afterward that the date I posted that was the 18th and not the 24th. The date on my friend's computer was about a week off for some odd reason. The date of the sighting was the Sunday, January 16, 2011, the most recent Sunday.  Thank you for inquiring and not simply disregarding the posting.
