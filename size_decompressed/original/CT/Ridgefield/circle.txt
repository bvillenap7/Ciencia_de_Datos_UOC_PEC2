Massive circular object hovering in the night sky, year 1985.;1985-12-25 22:00:00;1:00;Massive circular object hovering in the night sky, year 1985. Witnesses: Male 18 years old Female 14 years old I was sitting on a window bench seat with my back to the window and felt a strange sensation like a light was shining in on me. I turned around and witnessed the UFO the person I was speaking to saw my face and new something was strange. I said look out side what is that she was in shock also. We both became pretty excited. We just could not explain the object. We both got up and ran down the stairs and opened the front doors and out into the yard. That’s when it became kind of scary...this thing didn’t go away and it was really there. It was massive hovering about 100 to 200 feet above our front yard. It was a circular object on its side just sitting in the sky there was a pulsating glow around the edge of the object I don’t know if it was lights or just energy but it was amazing to me because for such a huge object there was almost no sound. The only sound was a humming pattern but not anything I have heard before like it was in your body. The time becomes hard to explain when your adrenalin kicks in but when we both looked at each other and new it wasn’t going away we yelled for our family to come and witness it also. When the family got to the front door. This massive object created a cloud and slowly rolled behind it. Never to be seen again.;41.2981500000001;-73.4942078947368
