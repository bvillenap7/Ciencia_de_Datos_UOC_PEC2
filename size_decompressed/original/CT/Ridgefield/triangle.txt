triangular ufo flew overhead;2000-10-20 20:30:00;2 minutes;triangular ufo flew overhead I was walking outside on my grandfather's farm and noticed how deathly silent it was.  Normally it was full of animal noises, but this night it wasn't.  I looked up at the stars and was extremely surprised to see a triangle flying overhead!  As it slowly flew above me, time seemed to stay still.  When it disappeared over the tree tops I ran to tell my grandfather but he didn't believe me and he hadnt seen it.  The triangle UFO was black and had lights around the edges.  It seemed to be the size of a commercial airliner. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.
