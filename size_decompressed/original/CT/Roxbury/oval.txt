It was a green light circling above the cloudline above my house.;2012-10-04 19:30:00;10 minutes;It was a green light circling above the cloudline above my house. There were two white crafts circling above my house above the cloud line.  They had a green aura and after repeating a clockwise circle above my house, they joined together and became one green light.  They looked a lot like searchlights.  After joining together they changed their pattern to an egg shaped path.  Their shape was a lot like an oval or football.  	 	It was pouring rain, but when they appeared the rain ceased. It was very dark and cloudy.;41.5526;-73.3036
