Dark spherical object sighted moving south to north at a rapid pace in the Litchfield Hills area of Connecticut.;2002-08-11 19:56:00;2-3 minutes;Dark spherical object sighted moving south to north at a rapid pace in the Litchfield Hills area of Connecticut. There was one craft dark gray to black in color.  The shape was a squashed sphere.  There appeared to be a lump on the bottom center.  It appeared metalic.  It traveled from south to north smoothly and without a sound.  We get many balloons over this area.  This object did not appear to be a balloon as it traveled much faster. We are located at N40ยบ 32.517'   W73ยบ 20.131'.  I was in the back yard at dusk when I looked up to observe a private plane flying over head north to south.  I then noticed the object higher and to our west traveling south to north.  At first I thought it was another plane, but there was no sound.  It looked round and not at all like a plane.  I would have dismissed it at that point as a balloon were it not for the color and speed of travel.  I ran to the house for binoculars and sure enough it was indeed round (spherical) in shape.  My wife and I watched until it disappeared to the north. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness describes self as having considerable technical background.  PD));41.5526;-73.3036
