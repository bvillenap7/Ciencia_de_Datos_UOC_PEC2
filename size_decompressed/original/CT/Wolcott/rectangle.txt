Large rectangular low-flying object 4 nonblinking green lights squarely centered on underside.;2011-03-01 19:46:00;<1 minute;Large rectangular low-flying object 4 nonblinking green lights squarely centered on underside. I was driving up Southington Mountain (Meridan Road) in Wolcott  CT on March 1 2011 at 7:46 pm. The area is mostly woods and the trees are quite tall. I noticed 4 green non-blinking lights through the trees to the left of me.  The object passed over the road near the treetops. It appeared to be descending.  At first I thought that it was a plane crashing. As it was above me, I realized that the lights were squarely in the center underside of a huge object. It appeared to be rectangular. The surface was dark-gray or black and completely non-reflective.  I don't think I would have noticed it if there were no lights.  I cannot really estimate the size except to say the area with the lights paralleled the width of the road.  I glimpsed it through the trees on the other side of the road for a few more seconds. I got to the top of the hill and pulled into a parking lot but did no see it again.  I did notice a plane flying in that area but much, much higher up.  I watched! for sightings on your website for the next month and finally noticed 2 separate ones for the exact date and time.  One in Waterbury and one in Wallingford/Meriden.   I could not decide whether to report it or not.I wish to remain anonymous.  Thanks, Liz;41.6026;-72.9765
