Red object over NH County, CT;2012-06-24 21:59:00;1 minute;Red object over NH County, CT Just before the ISS appeared from WNW, we saw a bright orange/red light, about the same size as the ISS and moving about as fast. But from North to South in direction. The ISS and this object were visible at the same time and almost crossed paths at about 80 degrees WNW-SE. No noise was heard and it disappeared at about 70 degrees South, before the ISS disappeared out of site. It appeared to be very high and lasted about 40 seconds.  But not a meteor.  Too slow for a meteor. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));41.6026;-72.9765
