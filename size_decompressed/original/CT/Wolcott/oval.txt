I walked out of my house around 1:15 am and looked up and seen a bright white light which was slightly oval traveling at an extremely high rate of speed.  It seemed to be relatively low, I honestly cannot determine the exact elevation because it happened so quickly.  It headed in a south west direction.   My first rational thought was a shooting star (I have seen hundreds of shooting stars/meteorites before), but this was about the size of a full moon in the sky and left no trail behind it.  I have never seen anything like it before and would love to know the explanation.;41.6026;-72.9765
