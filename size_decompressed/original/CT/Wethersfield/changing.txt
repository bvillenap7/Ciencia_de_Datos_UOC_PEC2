We both saw lights about 1 mile in the distance in a cluster shape or formation, seeming yellow at first.  These lights would disapear and the reapear on the other side of the formation.  These transports happened at least 4 times. It was slowly moving in our direction. Then as they got closer, but still at least a half mile away, most of the lights seemed to disappear and then only three remained.  It was a triangle with a red blinking light at the top and two solid yellow lights at the bottom.  It hovered in the air, not moving, for at least 3 minutes as we watched.   Then it began to seem to sway back and forth once or twice then began moving to the lower right of the tree line.  Before it was out of site it slowly changed direction and went to the lower right instead.  Not moving straight, like any regular aircraft.   It was hardly visible as it moved through the trees until out of sight.   Several minutes later the same object or an identical one went to the same exact spot in the sky and stayed hovering for the same duration of time before following the path the other took.
