Bright light in the distance.  As we got closer saw it wasn't moving.  Got a good look, almost under it. October 25 2015--~1am  Driving south on interstate 91.  Had just merged on to 91 from route 3 in Wethersfield.  Saw a bright white light in the distance off to our left.  Pointed it out to the 3 girls in the car with me.  As we got closer (still a bit away), thought it was a circle as we saw the lights around the outside.  The closer we got, could see it very clearly---I thought it was a triangle shape but with a blunted front.  Bright white light in the center and lights around the outside perimeter.  Girls had more time to look (I was driving) they said full triangle.  It was hovering in the same spot the entire time, looked to be over Wethersfield around exit 24.  Entire sighting was probably only about 30-40 seconds.  From the time we got on 91 at exit 25, until we passed it around exit 24.  Very Cool.

Triangular lights, hovering, no sound....;2017-12-21 18:00:00;5-7 minutes;Triangular lights, hovering, no sound.... I was with my wife,heading south, going to store in my auto.  noticed a bright white flash of light in sky the  about 6 city blocks from me  .thought it might be a low flying helicopter.proceeded south and noticed 2 yellowish orange lights where the initial flash came from.   I then pulled into store parking lot, almost under lights.grabbed my binoculars and got out of the car.looked up and could see nothing but blacker than the sky and still 2 lights.leaned down into car and said to my wife,do u see that?what the hell is that?  Looked up,now 3 lights in triangle shape, hovering...still no sound, and had a Feeling it or they seen me....whatever it was ,was big,based on light pattern,and i would say it was about 400 yards in the air,i am not positive, but i would say 3 or 4 football fields in the air.  still not seeing anything thru binocs but blacker than the sky triangle.  i put binocs in car, look up and its gone....do a 360 and the only thing i see is a small rectangle of! light as bright as the first flash i seen, heading north/ northeast and getting smaller and smaller until it disappeared from my view in a heartbeat. still dumbfounded....not a big UFO guy.   Didnt know who to report it too or if i should even bother.  But i cant stop wondering what this was.  can be reached by email provided if necessary.  thank you.;41.7041;-72.679
