Video available my daughter, while trying to record birds chirping using the video recorder on her mobile phone, recorded a spherical object above the roofline of the building next door.  The roof creates an artificial horizon and it is difficult to determine distance from object.  It comes into view from the roof line to the right of the chimney, goes up and around in a circle to the right and disappears back down below the roof line.  Duration of object in line of sight is approximately 3 seconds.;41.7041;-72.679
