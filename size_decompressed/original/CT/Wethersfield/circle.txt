Walking up Nott Street on approx.  The night of the 15th something with an unusual light pattern flew over head very quickly and we all thought it very odd.

It was night time,I noticed the object first as it was comming  down wards at about a 110 degree angle before it froze still and it hovered for few seconds, then the object traveled west bound at a extremely fast speed leaving a streak, it could of just been our eyes adjusting to the extreme speed it traveled at.  But once it moved it disappeared in like a second completely from view.  We both looked at each other in disbelief but confirmed to see the same encounter.;41.7041;-72.679
