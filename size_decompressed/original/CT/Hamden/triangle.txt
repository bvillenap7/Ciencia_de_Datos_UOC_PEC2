I never reported this because the few times I had spoken of this people thought I was crazy.  Anyways, A friend and I had snuck out of my house one particular evening to meet up with his girlfriend.  We went over to a baseball park named Legion Feild a popular late night hangout for high-school kids.  As we were sitting on the blecher my friend noticed a bright light up above the horizon line.  I noticed that it looked like a flashlight or maybe even an incoming plane, but we are not in the way of any airport runways.  As we watched it approach where we were sitting we noticed it moved slower than a normal aircraft would have and that it made a sound that I could only describe as a vroom vroom vroom sound, maybe in vocal tones it sounds more accurate.  I cannot remember exactly but I do vaguly recall a light beneath the craft, I just don't remember color andf if it rotated.  My friend and I thought it very strange and noted that it did resemble what the stealth bomber might look like if it passed overhead.  The craft was very low to the ground as well it only felt as if it was about 500 or so feet above us.  We watched it pass over our heads slowly and disappear over the treeline behind us.  It has been 11 years since I have mentioned this sighting and I am sorry if this is too late to report.  I do remember my friend girlfriend showing up at the park shortly after our sighting and we asked if she saw or heard anything, she said no.  Is it possible we were the only two who were allowed to see it? ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  PD));41.3811554347826;-72.918129347826
Several blinking red, white, blue, and green objects in sky moving to one spot.;2019-03-27 00:00:00;1 hour;Several blinking red, white, blue, and green objects in sky moving to one spot. I woke up a little after midnight. I looked out the bathroom window and a red and white blinking object was in the sky.  t stayed in one spot for about 3 minutes and proceeded to move faster and blink red.  It went towards the backyard.   I looked out the back window and saw one white, another white, and red flashing lights light up the sky in a line.  Looking around the sky, several more triangle shaped objects all oddly moved DOWN towards this line of flashing lights.  Two were disc shaped and were fastly blinking red, white, blue, and even green.   My mom and I also heard a powerful unordinary sound.  Once ALL these objects made it to this line of flashing lights, we saw continued blinking but the objects seemed to vanish.;41.3811554347826;-72.918129347826
