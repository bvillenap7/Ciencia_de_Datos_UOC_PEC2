Bright yellow orange lights started slowly decending and then made a quick half arch in sky downwards.  It almost appears to be an asteroid coming into earth's atmosphere because it was so bright.  It then started to move across the sky lateraly continuing to slowly decend. It did not act like a plane or helicopter, but I did think that there would be a plane crash because of the way it was decending.  I heard no roar of engines.  I followed it in the sky by driving in the direction of it.  It did seem to hover at one point and then I lost it behind the trees.  It was definitely a bright light, I could not make out any shapes because it was dark.  But I have never seen anything behave like that in the sky.;41.3811554347826;-72.918129347826
