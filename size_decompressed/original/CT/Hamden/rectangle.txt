Clear skies, mid-afternoon.  It was silver, no windows, no wings a very long, overall tapered rectangular shape.  ((anonymous report));2011-07-11 14:00:00;1 minute;Clear skies, mid-afternoon saw craft come into view.  It was silver, no windows, no wings a very long, overall tapered rectangular shape. It's lead and trailing ends were symmetrical, at first appearing to be the nose of a jetliner but then veering away at about a 60Â° angle, gradually rounding to a ling, flat surface that extended a long way until the opposite end mirrored the front.  So, it was apparently symmetrical top to bottom, as well as side to side (or front to back). It's progress slowed to a crawl and then it appeared to hover.  Then it started getting bright, like it was reflecting light.  The sun didn't seem to be a likely source because of the time of day and position of the craft. The light got brighter and brighter, more intense and making it hard to keep looking.  The light became so big, it appeared to be emanating from the craft and making the central portion of the craft more and more bright. Then, suddenly just like that, it wasn't there anymore.  No movement was visible before it vanished.  It simply was there one moment and gone the next. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
