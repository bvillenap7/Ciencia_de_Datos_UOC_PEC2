We saw a lg.bullet shaped object rise,vertically upwards.;2001-03-20 16:00:00;3 to 5 minutes;We saw a lg.bullet shaped object rise,vertically upwards. As I left a small store, in a small shopping plaza,to return to my car, my eight year old son,who was in the car,pointed upwards to me. I entered our car and discussed what we viewed.We then,both,got out of the car, to watch a thick stream of pinkish smoke(gas)...rise vertically on the horizon,very soon(seconds)after,which,we saw a large bullet shaped,object, Very shiny and silver,with one circular ring around it's middle,(and apparently attached)start to rise vertically. We had great difficulty,in not paying attention to it.I did not seek the attention of any other people in the lot,there were very few. We saw it reach a certain altitude,then,saw,it start to fly horizontally,left,to,us.There were no flashing lights or sound to be heard. We,then,got in the car,to follow as best we could,the direction,it was headed.We travelled approximately one tenth of a mile(if that)to see only a grayish line of smoke(gas)in the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and we found her story rather interesting.  We do not know what she saw, but the case is now in the hands of MUFON/CT.

IT WAS MUCH LONGER THAN AN AIRPLANE. I FOLLOWED THE BOOMERANG SHAPED LIGHT FROM THE YARD TO THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE WHILE RUNNING AFTER IT LOOKING UP. IT FLEW THROUGH THE SKY AT A SPEED FASTER THAN A JET. I KEPT MY EYES ON IT THE WHOLE TIME UNTIL IT QUICKLY DROPPED PAST THE STAR I WAS KEEPING MY EYE ON AS WELL,AND IT SEEMED TO GET SMALLER AND DISSAPPEARED TOTALLY.;41.3811554347826;-72.918129347826
