Three hundred fifty objects in the sky with different color lights moving, one disc shaped with on bottom yellow, green, red lights.;2006-04-02 21:00:00;90 minutes;Three hundred fifty objects in the sky with different color lights moving, one disc shaped with on bottom yellow, green, red lights. At nine o'clock at night we were outside and saw many objects flying, one, two, three, and even four at a time that was forming patterns in the sky. They were making triangles, lines, circles or just coming together and then apart. The night was clear, there was no noise, they were moving fast and coming together and then apart.  Three lights stayed in a line for about one hour and did not move.  One of the objects appeared disc shaped and was overhead close enough to see the bottom which had two green lights, two red lights, and two yellow lights underneath it.  It appeared as some of them were stars in the sky and then started moving.  Some of them seemed to have a red light down the middle.  There were blue, and green lights.  All together in a ninety minute period there was approximately three-hundred fifty objects in the sky together.  Some moving and some staying still.  We called the Police Department and the officer saw them and had no explanation but did not seem concerned.  He thought they were airplanes.  Airplanes make noise, these didn't, airplanes are not in the air  six moving at the same time.  There were eight witnesses to this, and nobody seemed to have any idea what this was.  We will go out again tonight and see if there is anything there.  These looked very suspicious and not normal.;41.3811554347826;-72.918129347826
