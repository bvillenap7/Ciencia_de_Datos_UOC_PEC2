Please be sure that I am as serious as could be.  I had just come home from work.  I just stepped out of my car when I saw it just below and to the right of the moon.  It was traveling very quickily, with no sound, in a westerly direction.   My first impression was that this was a piece of space junk re-entering the atmosphere.  However it was by far the largest object that I have ever seen of this type, meaning such as meteors.  It appeared to be about one twentieth the size of the full moon and brighter.  The leading edge seemed to be a greenish color.  I had limited view of the object due to my house.;41.3811554347826;-72.918129347826

There was no noise and they came in clusters.  There were 3-6 in a cluster.  They flew very low.  They disappeared even though it was a clear night and we could see all the stars.   They were different shades on orange. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));41.3811554347826;-72.918129347826

It flew over us at the rate of an airplane maybe , but it clearly was no flying anything Iâ€™ve ever witnessed.  Then I was trying to aim my phone to take the photo and it vanished into the sky and it was completely gone .;41.3811554347826;-72.918129347826
