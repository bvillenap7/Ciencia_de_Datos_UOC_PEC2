((HOAX??))  Blue-Green flash in the night sky.;2016-03-28 23:45:00;3-5 seconds;Blue-Green flash in the night sky. I was driving on Route 15 in Hamden after entering the highway from exit 60.  I was headed south west towards Orange when I saw a blue flash in the cloudy sky to my south, probably over New Haven or the Long Island Sound.   At first I assumed the flash was lightning - it was an incredibly windy night and lightning wouldn't have been out of the question - but over 1 or 2 seconds the flash turned green before lingering for another second or two, and then disappearing.  There was no discernible thunder.  The flash could have been one of many things:  environmental phenomena, a flare, a bi-product of some sort of industrial/scientific activity, a bi-product of military testing, or a UFO.   Interestingly, later that night as I was driving in Orange, there was a tree down, (from the wind), in the middle of the road.  I called the Orange PD to alert them about the tree in the road and they sent an officer out to the scene - this police officer said that she had also seen the flash in the sky. One final thing to note - there was what seemed like some sort of fire in Milford/Stratford today. The smoke could be seen and smelled from where I live in Orange.   The smoke from this fire may have weirdly filtered the light from a lightning bolt from blue to green and I may have been unable to hear the thunder because it was either too far off or my car was too noisy.
