It was a clear night with moon and stars.  I was sitting on my front steps while my dogs were sniffing around in the front yard.  One of the dogs started barking at the north eastern sky.  I looked up and saw a cluster of round white lights with a wide orange circle around it, looked like a flame.  My dog was barking like crazy and I called my husband to hurry and come out with his camera to see it.  He took some pictures and some came out, but no orange flame.  It looked like it was moving slowly to the east.  After about 10 minutes the orange flame went out and there was just the cluster of round white lights. I am emailing images. you need to blow them up to see anything.  The one withs the rings around it is closest to what we saw, except the outer ring was orange. If you want latitude and longitude, look up the Brookfield high school, that would be close.;41.4650000000001;-73.3979999999999
