Bright orange/yellow object moving at high speed making no sound;2010-09-25 19:15:00;15 seconds;Bright orange/yellow object moving at high speed making no sound I was in my backyard alone and i noticed a large bright object moving across the sky at great speed.  It was low in the sky and moved without sound.  The core of the object was shaped like a peace sign or the middle of sand dollar.  The core was a bright orange/yellow, like the color of a flame.  The core emitted something that was like exhaust in all directions which created a circle around the core making if look a bit like the center of a jellyfish.  Based on watching other planes in the sky, I would guess it was three to four times the speed of those planes. One to two minutes later, I saw a fighter jet travelling at a slightly slower, but very fast speed following the same path the object had taken.  I jet made a loud sound as it passed overhead at a similar altitude. I can draw the core and the circle that was around it.;41.4650000000001;-73.3979999999999
