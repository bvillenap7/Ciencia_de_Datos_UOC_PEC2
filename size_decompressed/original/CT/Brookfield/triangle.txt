I was pulling into my friend’s driveway and through my windshield I saw a craft.  It looked like it was in the woods.  The best way I can explain it is, it looked like a small fighter plane.  It was white or a silver in color.  From what I could tell, it was maybe 25-50 feet long.  It was pretty small (although it was hard to tell exactly where it came from because it happened so fast).   It slowly hovered at an angle, almost as if it was taking off.  I kept my eye on it until it suddenly zoomed off as such a speed that my eyes couldn’t even keep track of it. I searched the cloudless sky for the craft, but it was no where to be seen.  The only reason I knew I wasn’t going completely crazy is because I heard it.  After it had zipped away, it left me with the sound of it taking off.  It was quite loud. I know it wasn’t a plane.  There are no airports anywhere where I live.  Plus, the area I live in is too woodsy to fly a plane.  It was way too small to be a plane.  It was too big to be any sort of model toy plane too.  I have no idea WHAT it was, but it definitely was something.  (My brother and mom also saw a blueish light zip off the night before).;41.4650000000001;-73.3979999999999
