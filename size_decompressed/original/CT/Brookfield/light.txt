One large, luminous sphere apeared over the Northwest horizon directly in front of my friend and I, the diameter of the light itself would have easily covered the moon.The light was traveling over 100 MPH, at an altitude of only about 1000 feet yet did not make any sound.  If the object were a helicopter or an airplane, we would have easily heard it.  The light was similar in size and shape to the objects that appeared over Phoenix 2 weeks ago.  At the time, we were both students In Brookfield.  I was 10 years old, and my friend was 11 years old.  We had gone outside to look for UFOs, but we were not prepared for what we saw that night.  I am only submitting this information after the occurrance of a similar sighting over Phoenix, AZ.  Thank you.;41.4650000000001;-73.3979999999999
Hovering light Christmas Eve over Brookfield Connecticut 2003;2003-12-25 23:30:00;1 hour plus;Hovering light Christmas Eve over Brookfield Connecticut 2003 Looking West from Brookfield thirty degrees to the right of the Big Dipper, and adjacent in Horizon to a triangle of stars, a light object that looks almost like a bright planet- but larger is going vertical then descending, then going verticle- this has been going on since 11:30 when I noticed the strange motion of the lighted object- from my perspective it apears to be over the Town of Bridgewater, CT. It hovers and stops for thirty seconds or more at the top then descends back down towards the horizon then ascends again and again. There is only one light/object, it's movement is not like a satalite, plane or ultralite craft. It appears to be at an altitude where the wind can affect it as it looks to be pushed around by winds, ground winds presently around 10- 15 mph gusts, 31 degrees f. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness might have been looking at a celestial body.  PD));41.4650000000001;-73.3979999999999
3 large bright lights quickly appearring and disappearing;2008-06-03 19:00:00;5 seconds;3 large bright lights quickly appearring and disappearing While driving south on Super 7 in Brookfield, 3 large, white, round lights appeared in a linear configuration in the south east sky approx 1000 feet high.  The lights disappeared after a few seconds, the one closest to me disappearing first, then the middle light then the light farthest away.  The sky was overcast, with a thick cloud cover.  By the time I asked the 2 passengers in the vehicle if they saw the lights, the lights were gone.  We saw no craft or plane in the sky.;41.4650000000001;-73.3979999999999
Large, bright blueish light.;2012-01-08 20:00:00;5 seconds;Large, bright blueish light. My mom and I pulled up our driveway and as we got to the top, we looked out of the windshield and straight ahead of us in the sky was a big, round, bright orb.  It quickly shot to the left (straight) and then quickly went downward out of view.  It was too big to be a plane or a shooting star.  Also, planes and shooting stars do NOT move like that.;41.4650000000001;-73.3979999999999
