Rocket-like object streaking across the sky with whitish tail;2010-11-02 20:16:00;20 seconds;Rocket-like object streaking across the sky with whitish tail As I was driving east on Cannondale Road, I saw an object travelling which I initially thought was a plane, but then realized it was more like a white light streaking north across the sky.  It seemed as if it had white sparks (tail) coming out of the back.  It was a very odd looking rocket-like object that I thought might have been a meteor because the trajectory appeared slightly downward.  I quickly lost sight of it due to heavy tree coverage.
