Dome shaped object in Weston, CT.  Spring 1985;1985-04-01 20:00:00;45 minutes;Dome shaped object in Weston, CT.  Spring 1985 We first saw it as we crested a hill. At first, it appeared to be bright lights from a distant house.  As we approached the area by car, it seemed to shift from one side of the sky to the other.  The area where we saw it is very thick forest that opens to a large resevoir with a dam. As we crested the hill to the dam, it was hovering over the dam.  The water was high, but not moved by the UFO.  It was very large, shaped sort of like a cowboy hat with a very narrow brim, with a large yellowish ball protruding from the bottom.  The top was encircled by rotating red and blue lights.  It stayed there for as long as we did.  My mom only drove away as I started to get out the car to get a closer look. I was 14 at the time.  It followed us as she very quickly drove along the resevoir.  When it began to follow us it seemed to lean onto its side and appeared more cigar like.  Sikorsky Airforce Base reported numerous calls the next day. They said it was a weather balloon. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));41.219;-73.3723
