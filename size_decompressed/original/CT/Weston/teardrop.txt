My daughter-in-law and I were traveling in a quiet car, west on rte. 57 in the early evening so it was dark and there are no road lights on this route. A teardrop-shaped bright white light with a neon green colored interior of the drop and a long following tail crossed the road perpendicular to us - so, traveling low in the sky, and close, from north to south. The movement was fast and similar to a shooting star, but the object was much bigger. It crossed our entire field of view and we both saw it at the same time. My daughter-in-law thought it might be a helicopter or small plane because it was that close but I dismissed both because there was no fire - no orange or yellow at all. After it crossed our view we didnâ€™t see anything else.;41.219;-73.3723
