Brilliant, strobe-flashing, orange lights in Lebanon CT;2012-11-06 21:00:00;10 minutes;Brilliant, strobe-flashing, orange lights in Lebanon CT At approximately 23:00 the two of us saw a flicker outside the window. At first, I thought it was someone shooting off fireworks.   Upon opening the curtains, we saw a slow-moving object flying lower than most planes (helicopter height).  There was absolutely no noise.  It had brilliant, FLASHING orange lights (like an intense strobe light) and a bright red light on top.   We could not make out a shape behind the lights.   It traveled from East to West in a straight line over the course of about ten minutes.  We've never seen anything like it before.  Although we're more inclined to think it's some kind of military thing, we've never seen anything like it before.;41.6329;-72.2387
