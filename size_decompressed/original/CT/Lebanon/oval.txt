freaky ufo sighting close to house 1/4 of a mile away over corn field!!!;2006-11-21 23:30:00;1.5 min;freaky ufo sighting close to house 1/4 of a mile away over corn field!!! I am 11 and I saw a UFO in the western sky and before bed I lied down looked out and saw a oval shaped object and it looked around 1/4 of a mile away at most.  In clear view no fog at ALL in the field next to my house and on it was green and red flashing lights that flashed together.  It moved in an hourglass sort of path and was criss crossing about 4 times, and it didn't look like a plane AT ALL!   Then it went straight up in the sky and then suddenly came almost down to the ground then I lost it!!!  I would not lie because I am 11 and old enough not to lie  and I am honest this is a true sighting. this is the first time i saw something like this.
