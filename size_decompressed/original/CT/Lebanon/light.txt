Bright green light covering Northeast horizon of Lebanon CT.;2018-02-22 22:00:00;22:00 to 23:30, still goi;Bright green light covering Northeast horizon of Lebanon CT. On the end of Waterman RD headed to center of Lebanon.  Direction is almost exactly Northeast.  The entire horizon is bright florescent green.  There is nothing in that direction besides fields, and forest.  Windham is too far to the left of where this is. Lights up about 90° worth of horizon to the NE, and the brightest part is just right of NE.  Very bright and distracting, almost had an accident because of distraction.  When I arrived home, had a friend validate at 11:30 PM and it is still going on.;41.6329;-72.2387
Three witnesses observed an object that maneuvered in different directions.  ((MUFON report));2018-05-31 23:35:00;Several minutes;Three witnesses observed an object that maneuvered in different directions Orb of white light flashing intermittently and changing direction over livestock farmland. Seven hours after alert and 92 miles from MADAR site.  Primary witness, his brother, and girlfriend were outside when they noticed a white, intermittently flashing orb hovering behind trees in his backyard.  It resembled car’s headlight but there was no road there.  It disappeared and then reappeared seconds later above the treetops, flashing for a few seconds then disappeared again.  It reappeared behind the trees, downward and to the right of where it was just seconds prior.  Witnesses were freaked out and went inside the witness home and watched from the window to see if it reappeared, but it didn’t.  It made no noise.  Witness suspected it was possibly a drone but nobody lives anywhere even close to where the light appeared to be.;41.6329;-72.2387
A light at star level moved diagonally, sped up and then raised higher and disappeared.;2018-08-15 03:20:00;2 minutes;A light at star level moved diagonally, sped up and then raised higher and disappeared. At around 3:20AM,  we noticed a bright light while looking at the stars on Lake Williams. The light slowly strat to move to the right of us.  The light was coming from a height much higher than a plane would be flying and it was moving in a diagonal direction at a somewhat steady pace. An airplane started to come into the area where this light was at a much lower level. As the plane got in closer towards the light, the light picked up speed to where it eventually looked like it raised higher and disappeared..  The light was still in an area that was in our range of view but we could no longer track or see it. We tried to record it but the light was too far to be picked up by cellphone camera.;41.6329;-72.2387
