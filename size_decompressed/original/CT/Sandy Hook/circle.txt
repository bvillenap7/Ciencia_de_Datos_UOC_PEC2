Loud Vibrating Noise and Object.;2020-04-26 00:00:00;12:00 AM- 12:40 AM;Loud Vibrating Noise and Object Loud vibration noise coming from outside bedroom window.  Blinds were shut so when opened encountered a circular object in sky with white boxed lights around it, not blinking or moving.  Staying perfectly still as it was hovering over woods and trees.  The noise went away as the object disappeared, so very slowly descending farther.  Will try and update more, weird noises and sightings happen constantly.;41.4054;-73.2572
