Large lit object cruising at very low altitude over Rt 34 in CT at night - no airport immediately nearby;2018-10-03 20:45:00;Few minutes;Large lit object cruising at very low altitude over Rt 34 in CT at night - no airport immediately nearby Witnessed while driving NW on RT 34 in CT between the Stevenson Dam and Great Ring Road. Object was floating at a low altitude over Route 34, it was very large, and had many white lights along the sides.  Lights were steady - not flashing.  It was way too low and noiseless to be a 747 jet, and moving too slowly and silently.  It looked like it was only a couple hundred feet up over the treetops.  The shape was hard to describe, it looked rather rectangular when in front of us - like a big floating platform -  then appeared to be more triangular as we passed underneath and looked back to try to get a better look. We turned into Great Ring Road and then tried to get a better look at it, but it was gone.   There were plenty of planes in the sky at the same time - at normal altitudes though.;41.4054;-73.2572
