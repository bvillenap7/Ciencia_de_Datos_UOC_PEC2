Flash shuts lights on UFO.;2017-07-31 22:00:00;2-3 minutes;Flash shuts lights on UFO Last night, I looked towards my neighbor's house and saw 4 red lights in the sky.  They were in a square shape.  It did not move at all or make any sound.  I quickly tried to take a photo and didn't notice my flash was on.  The 4 red spots disappeared when the flash went off.   I stared at were it was, then noticed a small white light blink, then within a few seconds, the four lights came back.  I quickly shut my flash off and took a bunch of pictures.  After a minute or so it slowly moved then stopped again.   Then maybe 10 seconds later it moved again, but I lost my visual due too trees.  Was an amazing site to see.  It was around the Lake Zoar area, between Sandy Hook and Southbury, Ct.;41.4054;-73.2572
