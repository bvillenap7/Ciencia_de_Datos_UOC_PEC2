Multiple lights in the woods.;2019-04-04 23:00:00;2+ hours;Multiple lights in the woods, About 11 pm, my daughter let me know there was a red light in the woods around our house, which is surrounded by the Paugusett State Forest--3800 acres, no camping allowed.  I figured it was a neighbor's house light through the woods. I later got up and checked it out. In the woods you could see a few lights--spread out over a few hundred yards.  The one constant was the light in the middle- it did not disappear as the others would occasionally do. It was hard to determine the size of each light and the distance from me in the dark.  It was also hard to definitively say how many lights, as they went on for a short bit, then after a minute (or few minutes) would disappear.  Then another light, in another position, would light up.  At one time you might see five lights, and then only two lights a minute later.  The lights were predominantly white, but would change to red, and occasionally greenish.  It was hard to detect much motion in the lights, as they were small (almost like looking at a star sized light, in the woods), and just moving your head gave it the appearance it was moving.  But by readjusting your position in the window, you would see more lights that might have been hidden from your line of sight behind a tree. It was not a series of campfires, nor flashlights (my first thought).  Not sure what it was, but it was there for a good two hours before I went to bed. A number of years back, I did report a huge white light on ground level in these same woods.  That light was no more than 100 yards behind my house, in the winter (no foliage to obscure it).  That light was steady, and I alone observed that for a few minutes before getting scared and going to bed to hide from it.;41.4054;-73.2572
