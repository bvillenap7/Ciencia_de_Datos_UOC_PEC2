giant  vessel w/  4 horizontal lights makes no sound then stands upright in distance?;2007-08-18 23:00:00;05 minutes;giant  vessel w/  4 horizontal lights makes no sound then stands upright in distance? It was 10:40 pm eastern time when i walked outside with my daughter in arms when i saw 2 red lights horizontal from each other with white lights on each side. the craft was massive in size like a giant zepplin. The object drifted sideways not making a sound. I went inside to get my wife and we returned to see it just over head going the same speed. as i lost sight of it to a tree i walked around the block only to find the lights now vertical from one another in a straight line drifting off in the sky. evenn though I could not make out the outline of this vessel I believe it was very big, but not a sound?;41.2070745454546;-73.125350909091
