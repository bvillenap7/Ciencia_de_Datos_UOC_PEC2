Several orange lights moving in unison across the night sky.;2011-09-24 22:30:00;5 minutes;Several orange lights moving in unison across the night sky. As I was opening a gate at a parking lot, I looked up and noticed perhaps 10 or 11 bright orange lights moving slowly across the sky.  They moved across to a certain point and then each one appeared to just fade away gradually as they reached that certain point.  There was no noise at all and the whole event took no more than 5 minutes.   I told my coworker about this event and he informed me he had seen the same phenomenon a couple of nights earlier!;41.2070745454546;-73.125350909091
