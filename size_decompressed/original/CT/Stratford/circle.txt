Witnesed 2 star like objects slowly move across the  night sky then dissappear;2017-11-23 18:15:00;2 minutes;Witnesed 2 star like objects slowly move across the  night sky then dissappear I was out walking my dog  and happened to look straight up at the clear night sky and witnessed 2 white star-like objects moving slowy toward the ESE.  The best way to describe these is that they resembled two large  stars the size and brightness of Venus.   After about 2 minutes the first object suddenly dimmed out and disappeared, followed 10 seconds later by the 2nd object dimming out and vanishing as well.;41.2070745454546;-73.125350909091
