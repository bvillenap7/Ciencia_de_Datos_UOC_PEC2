In Stratford, facing west.;2015-06-22 21:35:00;2 seconds;In Stratford, facing west. Sky cloudless, no wind. About 30 degrees above horizon a fast skimming yellow fireball that traveled about 20 degrees from south to north by northwest on a straight path above horizon line. Have previously observed various meteors/bolides, but this object was nothing like them: No trail or scattering of light was a discrete yellow glow resembling a teardrop shaped bulb inwardly lit. Streaked swiftly (no sound), with a slight declination to its path just before it simply went out - no fading. I would not ordinarily bother to clutter this website with what I considered a bolide or yet another firework/Chinese lantern misperception, but this seemed genuinely unusual.;41.2070745454546;-73.125350909091
