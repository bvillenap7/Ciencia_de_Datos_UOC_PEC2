The shape was somewhat of a diamond with 2 seperate lights following..Reminded me of a kite. I called for my boyfriend and son (he's 8) to witness with me.  The UFO was moving forward and also back and forth and left and right. At one point it appeared to hover and move back and forth.  While my son was watching with me we saw it turn around and then come back again.  The type of turn reminds me of a wide turn in a car. Last I seen of it it was traveling South moving closer to flying over my home.  It was headed in the direction of Bridgeport Ct.  There were airplanes flying and this object was higher in the air than the smaller aircraft flying.;41.2070745454546;-73.125350909091
