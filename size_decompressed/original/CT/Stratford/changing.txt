While watering flowers in the evening, I saw an object high in the sky which was motionless. The object was black and did not seem to Rachel advertise the sky as a plane would. I was able to get out my phone and tak. e many pictures before the object disappeared. Upon scrutinizing the photos later it seems that it was not an object but a hole in the sky which constantly changed shape.;41.2070745454546;-73.125350909091
