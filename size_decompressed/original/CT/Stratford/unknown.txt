For the last couple of nights I have been inexplicably waking up around 3:00 am.  Early this morning was no exception, but upon waking, I noticed out my window what I thought was a very bright star.  After staring at it for a couple minutes I thought it strange that it was extremely bright and colorful.  I noticed it blinking or twinkling quite a bit and changing from red, blue and white.  I got out of bed to investigate because I also noticed that it didn't move at all.  It was quite high, higher than any helicopter.  Take note - we live a few miles away from Sikorsky Aircraft so I know helicopters we see them all the time, along with jet aircraft which land and take off at Tweed and Bridgeport Airports.  The next thought that crossed my mind was that it may be a satelite or even the space station.  But the object was stationary at all times and remained nearby another star, which I was using as a reference for distance.  I woke up my wife (who was none too pleased) and after discounting all the previously mentioned possibilities, she agreed that it was something we have never seen before.  We both went outside and with my binoculars, tried to get a closer view of the object.  Even then, it was still too far away to discern any particular shape, but we could clearly see it changing colors.  Also of interest is that for the two hours that we continuously observed this object it remained stationery and within the same cluster of stars, moving along with the group as the earth rotated.  We saw this in the South Eastern sky without a single cloud around.;41.2070745454546;-73.125350909091
