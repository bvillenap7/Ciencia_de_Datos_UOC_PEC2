Perfectly straight trajectory, circular, 10,000 mph at least, 10,000 feet up, silver, unlike anything I could comprehend.;2014-04-18 15:00:00;10 seconds;Perfectly straight trajectory, circular, 10,000 mph at least, 10,000 feet up, silver, unlike anything I could comprehend Laying down looking up spotted what I thought was a bird at first, but then realized it was moving way too fast and realized it was thousands of feet up.   I then thought it could be a jet but it was perfectly circular.   There was also no jet stream and it was moving faster than any jet I've ever seen.   I would guess it was moving at least 10,000 miles an hour or more.   The object however had what looked to be a tail of some sort.  In fact it looked kind of like a balloon, because this tail was more underneath the object.  It was so far away that it was very small.   I would think weather balloon, or possibly even satellite, but it was just moving way too fast, and I don't think satellite because it was only maybe 10,000 feet above ground, and not a balloon because again, the speed and trajectory.   I had a very wide view it came out of the clouds but the sky was otherwise beautifully clear. It was about 3 or 4pm full daylight.   The trajectory was west to east and direction, speed, and height did not change.   It was silver in color. I stared until I lost it in the treeline. It's like nothing I've ever seen.;41.3227;-73.0814
