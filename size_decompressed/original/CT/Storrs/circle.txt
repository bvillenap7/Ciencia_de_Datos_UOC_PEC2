Disk with spokes of light.  ((anonymous report));2019-01-12 03:30:00;1 minute;Disk with spokes of light Circular disk angled with face visible from my perspective, illuminated with glowing pattern of lights spreading like spokes from the center.  The lights pulsated red and green with the top section of spokes red and the bottom section green.   I was woken up by a sound like a helicopter and thought that’s what I was seeing, but it remained in the same relative place for some time and the lights did not behave like any aircraft I’ve seen before.  It was reminiscent of a drone in some ways but definitely much larger. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
