It had just rained and the clouds were gray and full. I decided to take a short video of the cloud formations for a Tik-Tok video. I filmed the clouds for a few second then went home. I was walking from my class at Uconn. I forgot about the video until the next morning. When I watched it I noticed a craft flying through my scene so rapidly and when I enlarged it the boxy shape looked like nothing Iâ€™d ever seen before. I noticed it hovered for a brief second then sped into the clouds and disappeared. When I slowed down the footage it was still moving very fast but I could clearly see it stopped in mid-air for a fraction of a second then continued. I showed it to a pilot from Delta that I knew and he said it truly looked like something not from this world so I decided to report it. The shape looked cigar like however when enlarged and pixelated it seemed to have giant rectangular wings, an elongated nose with a dark patch which looked like a pilots window and ! a very short tail that could barely be detected. I did not see it with my naked eye or notice it however when I watched the footage and especially when I slowed it down there was a strange sound that was in the background, almost like a zoom and a whoosh that could e been used on a sound track to indicate fast flight. There was no sonic boom or anything detected on the ground from the sidewalk. I was in the center of Storrs Center near CVS pharmacy.;41.8021614035088;-72.2473894736842
