IT APPEARED GREENISH IN COLOR TO ME,  I HAVE SEEN NUMEROUS SHOOTING STARS AND THIS WAS A DIFFERENT COLOR THAN I HAVE EVER SEEN.  ALSO SHOOTING STARS THAT I'VE SEEN HAVE ALWAYS APPEARED TO BE HIGH IN THE SKY, THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT IVE SEEN ANYTHING THAT I THOUGHT COULD'VE ACTUALLY LANDED OR BURNED UP CLOSE TO GROUND, IT REALLY SEEMED TO GO INTO THE TREE TOPS.  I WONDER IF IT WAS SOME SORT OF METEORITE THAT MADE IT TO THE GROUND, BUT SEEING ON HERE THAT OTHERS APPARENTLY SAW THE SIMILAR OCCURENCE FROM ALL OVER THE STATE.;42.0078;-72.7362
