They moved loosely changing formations.  Definitely not planes or helicopters, as I see airport traffic all the time.  They moved fast at first slowed down and stopped, I ran inside to call my 19yr old son & grab my cell phone.  When I came out of house with my cell phone, I saw 2 which were smaller, due to having moved to a further proximity now and more red in color now moving left to right they stopped and then seemed to wiggle and went straight away (NORTH) from us extremely fast & got very small & disappeared in seconds.

	I saw 3 orange lights in a formation coming to a stop moving west to east.;2016-01-31 20:46:00;~2 minutes;	I am a 19 yr old college student who was in my room on 2nd floor, when I heard my mother yelling if I wanted to see something cool to run outside and look to the left.  I went outside, expecting to see a animal or something, but she told me to look up and I saw 3 orange lights in a formation coming to a stop moving west to east.  Then I saw one start moving in quick little movements then it stopped then the other one started to do the same then they all disappeared into the distance moving north.   After I went to the internet and googled strange orange lights and saw pics of what looked like what I saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Please see other report from West Suffield for a sighting of the same objects.  PD));42.0078;-72.7362
