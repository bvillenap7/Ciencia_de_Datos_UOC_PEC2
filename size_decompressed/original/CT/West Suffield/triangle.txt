Triangle shaped craft over West Suffield;2017-09-28 23:15:00;2 minutes;Triangle shaped craft over West Suffield I was outside because the bear knocked over my trash cans.  There is a large horizon where I can see 300 degrees on the back side of my house.  I saw something triangular with three lights near each corner and it moved slowly across the horizon on an ark.  I saw it from about 5 miles away in the sky.  It did not look like any plane I have ever seen in the night sky.;42.0078;-72.7362

They  were hovering about 100 feet from the ground, DEAD SILENT-and as we kept driving down the road they increased in height and headed North West.  I had an instant gratification of fear, for I have never encountered such a suspicious craft.  It looked like a SIFI movie.;42.0078;-72.7362

I looked up and saw three bright white dots that looked like extremely bright stars in the shape of a triangle. They stayed in their formation but one by one they got dimmer and faded away until they were all gone.;42.0078;-72.7362
