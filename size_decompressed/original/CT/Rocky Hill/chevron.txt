5 objects sited in Eastern sky;2000-10-21 17:00:00;10 minutes;5 objects sited in Eastern sky On our way to dinner we observed 5 objects in the eastern sky. It was light out.  The object were like a dark grey color.  They were in a V formation almost like a flock of geese.  The leading object dipped then flew up and went between the other 4 then disapeared.  The remaining 4 object went into several different formations.  At one point two of them seperated from the other two.  They remained like that for about 3 minutes.   We judged the distance to be about 15 feet between the pairs. Then they just disapeared.   WE TOOK A PICTURE.  We had a digital camera with us and my husband was able to capture one fairly good picture.  At the time he took the picture you can see three of them. We don't know how to make the objects bigger in the picture, but tomorrow my son is comming over to see if he can.;41.6583;-72.6624
