Bright Light in  Rocly Hill/Berlin CT;2012-03-06 17:40:00;2-5 Minutes;Bright Light in  Rocly Hill/Berlin CT My wife and I were pulling into a local supermarket on Route 3 in Rocky Hill and noticed a bright light in the western dusk  sky, towards Berlin, CT.  The light was stationary and initially we dismissed it as a star however we witnessed the light completely vanish into thin air.  I was in the store no more than 5 minutes and when I came out the light was back.  When then pulled into a restaurant next door to the grocery store (about a 2 minute drive).  As we were driving the light remained and seemed to be in the same location as previous.  Withnin  minute or so, the light vanished into thin air again.
