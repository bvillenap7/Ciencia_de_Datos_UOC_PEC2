Small sphere about horizon while I was working on a farm.;2020-07-16 10:00:00;1 hour;Small sphere about horizon while I was working on a farm. I was facing South/South-East when I looked up to the sky and saw a bright reflection.  A small silver sphere/dot was floating without any movement about 60 degrees above the horizon line.  It sat there and floated for about 30-45 minutes with no movement that I could see, eventually I lost sight as clouds drifted in.  I was working on a farm at the time, the object seemed very far away regarding its size.;41.686;-71.9993
