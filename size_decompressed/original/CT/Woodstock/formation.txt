We saw maybe 3 or four lights pulsing and rotating around each other.;2014-07-15 03:00:00;20 minutes;Late at night my friends and I were laying in the grass looking at the stars and chatting.  One of us looked to the treetops to our left.  We all described the same sight.  We saw maybe 3 or four lights pulsing and rotating around each other just over the trees in the distance.   We watched them for awhile but then lost track of them.  It was absolutely quiet and an unreal experience to see. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
