Falling objects.;2012-09-15 21:00:00;2 minutes;Falling objects I was driving on rt6 heading from Chaplin toward Willimantic and I stopped at a red light in front of Walmart.  Walmart was on my left, to my right was Windham airport.  From that traffic light, strait ahead and above the tree line where rt6 splits into Willimantic or to the expressway, I saw 2 lights.  They were falling at the same rate but one stopped falling and stayed hovering/floating while the other fell below the tree line. I can't remember the exact date.  It was toward the end of 2012 and it was cold enough for me to have the top and doors on my jeep.  I did find a similar event in roughly the same place in 2011.  Below I copied and pasted said post.  If anyone else saw this I would like to know. Thanks for reading.
