Addendum to earlier report made on 01/09/15;2015-01-09 19:00:00;40 seconds;Addendum to earlier report made on 01/09/15 This is simply an addition or addendum to a report I made several days ago, I believe it was for 01/09/15.  After I filed the report I realized I made a mistake.  The craft was travelling from the northeast toward the southwest.  I believe I mistakenly wrote the southeast. That is error, it was going toward the southwest.  This is a very regular route for the many planes I see coming from Bradley Field in Hartford, so this might have been some sort of commercial or military craft, but it was quite spectacular and unlike anything I have ever seen, and I grew up around airbases, as my father was a aircraft radar technician by trade. I am also including a drawing I made in Paint. It will be obvious I am no artist, but it will give the rough idea.  I could not actually see any body to this craft, just the very bright and very beautiful lights.  Only the red light blinked, all other lights were steady.;41.8139000000001;-73.1123
Wow, I finally saw one of those triangular objects.;2015-01-09 19:00:00;40 seconds;Wow, I finally saw one of those triangular objects I am one of those persons who has seen UFOs numerous times.  I have literally seen UFOs probably at least a dozen times, but I had never seen one of these triangular objects until last night. I live in a 2nd floor apartment that faces east toward Hartford.  I get a nice unobstructed view of the sky and I constantly see planes coming from Bradley Airport about 20 miles away, or I see planes going in for a landing there.  So, I am VERY familiar with airliners. But tonight I just happened to look out and saw this BEAUTIFUL perfect triangle object.  It had many very bright white lights on it and was flying very slowly. I don't know how high it was, maybe 3-5000 feet at most.  It looked quite large, I got the impression it was probably twice the size of an average airliner.  I wish I would have had time to count the lights, but I am sure I saw probably 7 or 8 large white lights, and one very small blinking red light near the center.  But the entire craft was outlined by the white lights and was a perfect equilateral triangle 60/60/60.  It was really a very pretty sight.  It seemed to be going quite slow, much slower than the airliners I see every night.  If I had to guess, I would say it was going maybe 200 mph at most.  It was flying from northeast toward the southeast, which is the regular path many planes from Bradley follow. Anyway, I was only able to see it for about 10 seconds before it flew over my building, but I had time to put on a coat, grab a pair of binoculars and run downstairs which probably took about 15-20 seconds.  It was going so slow that it was still there and I got to look at it for about another 15 seconds before it went behind another building and I lost sight of it.  I am not completely sure, but I think I MIGHT have heard it, if so, it sounded like a normal airliner, but I might have been hearing another plane that I saw in the same part of the sky. That's it, very simple sighting, but a very beautiful object.  It was probably one of ours, but I don't care, I have always wanted to see one of these triangular objects, and now I have.;41.8139000000001;-73.1123
Strange object, gliding over my town.;2016-08-18 18:00:00;5 seconds;Strange object, gliding over my town. On August 18th, about 6PM, I happened to look out my 2nd story apartment window, which faces east.  I saw what I believed at first to be a large bird, gliding smoothly as large birds often do.   But as I looked closer, I saw this was a W shaped object with depth, almost like a paper airplane viewed from the rear, but I could see the full side as well.   The object was all black.  It was maybe three quarters of a mile away, and only a few hundred feet altitude.  I would estimate it was about the size of a small private airplane.  I would estimate it was going 20-30 MPH, not fast at all.  Unfortunately, I did not get much of a look, because it glided down behind some trees which obstructed my view.  I watched for several more minutes, but never saw it again. I drew this picture on my computer.  It is close to the shape, except this object was completely black.  http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v403/Winman/Object%20in%20sky%202_zpsur8gtmjg.png;41.8139000000001;-73.1123
A triangular shaped object flying over Torrington, CT.;2016-10-06 05:45:00;30-45 seconds;A triangular shaped object flying over Torrington, CT. I was driving up Hospital Hill & when I reached the top I noticed what appeared to be a line of lights on the horizon.  As I continued down the road, it came much closer very fast and I realized it was a triangle gliding over the town.  I instantly pulled over and took multiple photos, one of which captured the object.  It was dark, but I could still make out the shape so I was able to confirm it was an object & not 3 seperate orbs of light.  The corners were very defined, and I could make out the edges, each of which had one white light, and each of which illuminated the sky somewhat.  The object was moving fast, smooth, and silently.  I arrived at work, and was extremely happy to find that a coworker on the way to work had also seen this object gliding over the town.  The object was flying in a south western direction.  I'm awful with directions, but I can assume it was flying towards the Bristol, Thomaston, or Terryville area.;41.8139000000001;-73.1123
