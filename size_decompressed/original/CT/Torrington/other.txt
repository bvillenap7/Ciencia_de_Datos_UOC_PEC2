twin-lights  shoot over sky at a unbelievable speed  over torrington ,Connecticut  3/25/07 @ 8:58 P.M.;2007-03-25 20:58:00;3-4 seconds;twin-lights  shoot over sky at a unbelievable speed  over torrington, Connecticut  3/25/07 @ 8:58 P.M. I noticed 2 star-sized lights that moved horizontaly next to each other across the sky from the east  towards the west toward new york. They appeared to be  white lights. It was a very clear night and I was outside in my hot-tub with my wife.I looked up into the eastern sky above my garage roof and at first thought that it was a meteor till I realized that there was two that were side by side . I imeadiately informed my wife as I jumped out of the hot-tub to run through the snow to my fence on the west side of my property (about 30 feet )because of pine branches that were in the way of the sky , but it was too late,as it was past the horizon . I always see many jets and planes that come in to my view in my back-yard and it takes a considerable time to cross from where I can see them from east to west ,4-6 minutes approximatly ,but these two objects stayed next to each other and traveled as fast as a meteor and within 3-4 seconds it went from the east to the west and out of sight . my wife did not see it ,as it happened so fast.;41.8139000000001;-73.1123
Airplane-shaped object with wings outlined in lights;2015-11-20 18:30:00;5 minutes;Airplane-shaped object with wings outlined in lights I happened to look in the sky tonight and saw what looked like an airplane, but the wings looked to be very much up front on the plane, and they were outlined in lights.  Which made the plane look somewhat like a boomarang.  It circled and while I was following it, I noticed another plane of the same type.  That one seemed to be just sitting there, perhaps what they'd call hovering.  I wasn't able to stay outside longer, I do not know what became of these crafts.;41.8139000000001;-73.1123
