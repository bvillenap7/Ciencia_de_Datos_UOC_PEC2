I was with a co- worker in a parking lot after work.  While we were talking I was staring at the sky like I usually like to do.  There was a light that looked like a star  but it was bigger and brighter than the other stars.  I didn't think anything of it, it just looked like a star.  Then all of a sudden it moved really fast.  I grabbed my co-workers shoulder and pointed it out to her. A few seconds later it disappeared.  It did not look like anything we ever saw before.  We discussed for a lengthy period of time what it could have been, and could not find any answers, I concluded that it must have  been a ufo and she agreed that we had both seen something we could not explain.
