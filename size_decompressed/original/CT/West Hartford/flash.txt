Bright light trail followed by bright explsion traced back to Aircraft.;2002-03-07 20:15:00;3 seconds;Bright light trail followed by bright explsion traced back to Aircraft. Left me preface this report with the realization that this may simply be a coincidence.  We witnessed a bright light trail which terminated into a bright explosion and when we followed the light trail back to it's origin there was an aircraft traveling from what appeared to be the exact same position in the sky. It may simply be a meteorite at a higher altitude and further off in the horizon followed by an airplane in a busy flight corridor closer in perspective but I rather report it than not. ((NUFORC Note:  The witness indicates a date in the year 2003.  We presume he meant 2002, and we have amended the date accordingly.  Witness elects to remain anonymous, but we believe he is the same gentleman who telephoned NUFORC.  He sounded serious minded and credible.  We suspect that he may have been witness to the terminal burst of a meteor.  PD));41.7665344827586;-72.7417045977012
