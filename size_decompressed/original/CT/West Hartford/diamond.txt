It was brighter than a star and seem illuminated.  Then 2 other similar objects /lights were seen at a distance to the south which formed a big triangle--way bigger than any constellation.  Very broad in the sky.   The third and highest one was almost directly overhead. These three were observed for a few hours and did not really move, but seems to stay in place.  However, when you focused really sharply with your eyes you could see some sort of diamond shaped object move and twitch erratically in a very limited area.  I was standing still and kept my eyes focused and watched them move and twitch many times.    About and hour after seeing the initial light several 12+ lighted craft at close range were seen by myself and 3 others flying over head east to west and near the full moon.  These had flashing red and white triangular lights.  Some were low to the ground, o! thers flew over a field and over my house from behind the trees.  A fourth light and others were seen hovering in the sky almost as if to form a line or pattern.;41.7665344827586;-72.7417045977012
