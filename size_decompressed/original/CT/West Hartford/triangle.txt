2 Trangular Craft Seen;2004-01-07 22:00:00;10 minutes;2 Trangular Craft Seen I was driving south on Trout Brook Drive in West Hartford CT around 10 PM on 1/7/2004 and I saw two very bright lights in the sky, hovering and moving slowly about 300 feet above the ground.  As an avid sky watcher, I am familiar with all of the planets and constellations and I know I did not mistake these objects for Venus or anything.  The moon was full, high in the sky and the sky was crystal clear.  I thought at first that they might be helicopters, but they were moving in a way that I have never seen a helicopter move...hovering slowly in a sort of circular motion  One of the objects started moving away and I lost sight of it, so I focused on the other.  I had to turn my car around and follow it and it turned from one bright object into a triangular shaped form with three white lights on each corner of the triangle and a few blinking red lights on it.  I pulled my car over to the side of the road, as did a bunch of other people to try to get a better look.  I rolled my window down to see if I could hear anything, but it was completely silent.  If it was a plane or helicopter, it was close enough where I would have definitely heard something.  At this point it was much lower, probably 75-100 feet off the ground.  It hovered and moved slowly and I continued to watch it for another couple minutes until it disappeared behind the tree line and I lost sight of it.  Because of the lighting on the ground, I had a bit of a difficult time trying to decipher the dimensions, but I would have to guess that it was about 20 to 25 feet in length and about 10 feet in height.  It looked like it was black, but being dark, I'm not completely sure.;41.7665344827586;-72.7417045977012
Triangular shape - intense lights - silent and vanished in speed of light;2004-03-07 07:00:00;30 seconds;Triangular shape - intense lights - silent and vanished in speed of light I was traveling on I-84 West, coming around the West Hartford curves.  There was an intense bright light, low on the horizon.  I wondered why an aircraft would be so low as the airport is too far away.   As I approached, the light did not move.  The light was so intense and bright that I cannot find words to accurately describe it.  I kick myself to this day for not stopping - I was in such shock that I kept driving.   As I got closer, the object was above the Troutbrook Exit.  It had to be only 200 feet in the air above me.  It made no sound.   It was silver, triangular shape.  It had a red light on the tip and red and white lights on the bottom.  It had an elongated rectangular door.  As I got underneath, I was able to see that the underside was concave.  After I passed it, I could no longer see it behind me.  It vanished - it was completely silent.   In early December, 2005 I saw the same intense light above my house as I came down my street.  (appx. 5 miles from original sighting)   I thought to myself, as soon as I get past these trees I'm going to stop this time and really look at it.   Within a half of a second I was on the otherside of the trees and the light was gone - no where to be seen anywhere in the clear sky.
