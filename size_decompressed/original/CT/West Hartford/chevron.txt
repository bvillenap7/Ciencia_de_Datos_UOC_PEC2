I didn't think much but I thought it kind of low.  As it continued to move across the sky to the northwest it slowed and then stopped - no noise - no white flashing lights - but then I could see that there were boomerang shape and it starts to disappear but it never totally disappears but I can see through it.  It stops and immediately takes a 90-degree turn and speeds up southeast.   After 15 or 20 seconds, it starts to go back to its northwest course.   It was surreal!  This was not a plane or helicopter.  It disappeared but not  slow twice as fast as any of the planes in the sky.;41.7665344827586;-72.7417045977012

It seems to have a boomerang shape and moves smoothly and quickly back and forth and then swoops up or down at a 45 degree angle but in the same north east sky.  Tonight a second object appeared and streaking lights were seen around in the sky.  Seems to appear out of no where and disappear by quickly fading.;41.7665344827586;-72.7417045977012
