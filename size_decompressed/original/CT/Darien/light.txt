Golden Orb flying above and along I95 North;2021-01-29 18:18:00;3 minutes;Golden Orb flying above and along I95 North At 6:18pm I turned left from Boston Post Road onto Noroton Avenue where I proceeded to drive home from a late Doctors appointment.  I then noticed a light in the sky which I initially thought was a star, but it was different because it was golden in color, so as I drove toward it, I kept looking up at it, that's when I noticed it seemed to be moving.  I wasn't sure though, until I came to a complete stop at red light that I could tell for certain that it was moving.  It flew left to right, headed and flying perpendicular to I95 North, toward a huge yellow Full Moon low on the horizon.  I called my mom and told her to come outside and then my boyfriend who was at my house and they got in the car and we drove looking for it. But all we found were airplanes and what we believe was a satellite.  The object I saw seemed to be flying lower than a higher flying airplane.  ;41.0743;-73.4804
