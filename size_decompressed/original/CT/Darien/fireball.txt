Orange Fireball gliding in the sky over Darien, CT 1/14/12 @ 9:15 p.m.;2012-01-14 21:15:00;1-2 minutes;Orange Fireball gliding in the sky over Darien, CT 1/14/12 @ 9:15 p.m. I was driving on Old Kings Highway, at the stop sign just by the YWCA.  At first I thought it was another planet shining in the sky because it was so large, but no, it was moving horizontally across the sky toward me from the right hand side of my wind shield gliding toward the left.  It was so strange, an orange ball of fire that did seem to flicker, but was so steady.  I'd never seen anything like it. It looked like a floating fire ball, but it was moving at a steady, intentional pace. It kept heading what I think was northward.  I tried to rationalize it but can't really figure how to do so because it was so high up.  But it was large enough to look the size (diameter) of a pen top from where I sat in my car.  NO I hadn't been drinking or taking anything at all.  Not even Advil. I was happy to see the reports from Southbury and Bridgeport not to long before.  They are towns relatively close to me.;41.0743;-73.4804
