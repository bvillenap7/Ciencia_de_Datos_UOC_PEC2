Orb hovering and fast zig zags over Long Island Sound with bounce and chirp noise.  ((MUFON report));2018-04-14 02:35:00;40 minutes +;Orb hovering and fast zig zags over Long Island Sound with bounce and chirp noise. April 14, 2018 Darien, CT 02:35 AM.  At home sitting on witness's roof terrace that has a view of Scott's Cove.  Noticed an unusual bright light in the sky and its reflection on the water.  Observer thought it was a star or planet so a photo was taken, then it started zig zagging really fast and stopping for about 40 minutes or so then flew out of sight.  All of this is on on video but the background is too dark to see a reference point. (MUFON);41.0743;-73.4804
