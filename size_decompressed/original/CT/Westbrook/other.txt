Silently dashed across the sky I would guess easily min 25x faster than a plane would at same height.  As the we’re reaching the last area I could see they seemed to split into 2 objects, as they appeared to come closer to each other yet at different levels in the sky.  This or these went over the tree line and I couldn’t see anymore.  The second I saw a few min later going east to west also had 2 same lights as the first. This one was almost directly over where I was standing.  At the same height as the other I could see what almost looked like a blur between the 2 light.  Giving me the impression that the object was clear enough to see thru as didn’t block out any stars.  Yet had the distinct appearance of being nearly invisible except the 2 side lights.  This one just mid sky disappeared as I watched;41.2922;-72.4616
