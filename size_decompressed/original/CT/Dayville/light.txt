Two women see green streak power failure in town green flash 30 minutes later;2010-07-29 00:58:00;Seconds;Two women see green streak power failure in town green flash 30 minutes later I am writing to inform you that last night at approx. 12:58 am, my sister in law and I were sitting in our living room watching TV.  Out of the corner of my eye in the bay window I was sitting near, I suddenly saw a bright green light appear out of nowhere, as the light came closer (it seemed like it was flying) to the house it became bigger and brighter, and just disappeared!  It seemed to fizzle out quickly.   I was frozen, and didn't say anything and my sister in law said OH MY GOD DID YOU SEE THAT?!  I turned on the outside light and saw nothing.  Not even 30 seconds after the fire station alarm was going off.  I still do not know why. About a 1/2 hour after seeing the light, we witnessed a flash of green light coming from the other side of the house.  My mother told me today that a lot of people who went into her work today were complaining about losing power as well last night.  I have to say that this was the weirdest, spookiest thing I have seen in my life.  My sister in law saw this dead on, where as I said, I saw it from the corner of my eye.  She will be writing in as well.;41.8495;-71.8713
