Fireball UFO seen by two witnesses in Dayville, CT;2012-12-22 08:40:00;2 minutes;Fireball UFO seen by two witnesses in Dayville, CT I was outside having a cigarette on an extremely cold and windy evening. It was cloudy with no stars in the sky. My house is located in a woodsy area.  Suddenly I noticed one large fireball glowing over the tree line. It seemed as though 2 smaller triangular shaped fireballs detached away from the larger one.   I called my girlfriend out to see it and by the time she got outside it had dipped below the treeline but she could still see the lights behind the tops of the trees.  Then the light just disappeared.;41.8495;-71.8713
