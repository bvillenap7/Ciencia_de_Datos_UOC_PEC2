Orange glowing round or oval object moving very fast from west to east;2007-08-04 21:30:00;1 min;Orange glowing round or oval object moving very fast from west to east All I can say is it wasn't a plane or any kind of space or weather phenomenon. The sky was crystal clear. This was a round or oval type craft that had a glowing orange oval or ball around it the orange glow would fade in and out at times it almost looked as though there was a smaller light on the bottom. The glowing light was out of this world nothing I have ever seen before. There was no sound from the object. The object was moving very fast it traveled from west to east rather fast taking only a few seconds to get across.;41.8495;-71.8713
