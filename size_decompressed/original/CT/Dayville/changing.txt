Strange black object looked oval hovered over western sky for a few minutes then started to move on a strait path towards the east.  Did not change direction while traveling however the craft did appear to change shape as it moved. Was traveling at a steady low rate of speed to the east towards Rhode Island.  Did not make any sound at all. Somtimes it looked as if it had wings other times it looked oval.  Very high up but below the cloud cover.  Also seemed to have a glowing ring around the craft.;41.8495;-71.8713
