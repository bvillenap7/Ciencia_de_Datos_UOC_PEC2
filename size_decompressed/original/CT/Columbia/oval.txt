Oval shaped ball of light.;2015-12-04 16:30:00;~20 seconds;Oval shaped ball of light. I was driving home from work when I noticed a light in the sky.  It looked kind of round in shape and was a solid light.  It appeared to not be moving at all and that is when I grabbed my cell phone and began recording.  It is really hard for me to remember exactly how everything occurred because I was really in shock at what I was seeing.  After I started recording I believe the craft started moving in one direction.  I tried keeping my phone on it while driving and right as it was going to be completely out of my view it shot straight up in the air and was gone.  The craziest part of the whole thing is after I got home and watched the video multi times I noticed more lights really high in the sky that I had not noticed when I was driving.  I have the video and am willing to submit it.   I noticed at the bottom of this page an email to send images.  The video I have is too large to send. I'm not all that tech savy, if someone can help and explain how to send it I would gladly send the video.;41.7026;-72.3156
