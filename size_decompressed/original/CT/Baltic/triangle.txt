3 very bright bloodred orbs flying in perfect triangular formation and smaller object approaching from opposite direction;2013-07-30 21:00:00;1 minute;3 very bright bloodred orbs flying in perfect triangular formation and smaller object approaching from opposite direction On tues July 30 @approx 9:00pm while in my backyard with my wife eldest boy 23 yrs and his girlfriend 21 yrs old we witnessed three very bright red objects flying in a triangular formation coming out of the NW traveling SE.  The objects took approx 1 min to travel 110 degrees of sky and were totally silent.  Upon reaching near zenith the objects began to flicker in and out of the visual spectrum and the central part of each blood red orb began to chage color and twinkle as well white and yellow light.  At that time I noticed what appeared to be another smaller dimmer object approaching from the opposite direction.  As it approached and passed the larger objects it appeared to execute an abrupt u turn and speed off trailing the other objects and disappear from view along with the other objects!   See video taken by my wife on our ipad.  I own a 20 inch obsession telescope and have logged countless hours under the stars.  I have never witnessed anything like this before, furthermore I contacted the FAA requesting wind speed and direction for that evening @ 3000 6000 and 9000 thousand feet.  They informed me that I would have to file under the freedom of information act to get the info.  I followed up with NOAA and spent 150 minutes on the phone to get the info.  The wind was out ot the NW traveling SE the same direction as my friends, however the speed was minimal.......3 thsnd feet 12 knots......6 thsnd feet 13 knots.......9 thsnd feet 7knots.  At ground level no wind whatsoever!  This data comes directly from the Brookhaven sounding station in Brookhaven NY.  Note: in order to see the smaller object traveling in the opposite direction the video must be viewed in complete darkness.  I am sending Pete new videos one with increased brightness and one in negative. The smaller object is much more apparent.  I also performed a control with the ipad on the star Arcturus and could not seem to record it,so there is no way the smaller object could be a stationary background star.  The original video on my ipad also sho! wed the smaller object to be the same blood red color as the larger objects.  There are no stars in that part of the sky of that color or magnitude!  Note:  The three large orbs were at least 7 times the angular size and brightness of Arcturus.  Independent analysis of this video would be greatly appreciated provided that the feedback is professional.         Thankyou very much,  ((name and address deleted));41.6263;-72.0775
