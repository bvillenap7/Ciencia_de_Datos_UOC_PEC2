Finished flying uavâ€™s near public park, when both myself and peer looked up to what he called out to where it traveled from northeast to northwest at about 300 feet to a 1000 feet up.  It moved slow and wobbled.  Wind meanwhile prevailing wind was coming from the south east at 7 mph.  Frogs in near by lake stopped crooking and no aircraft where in area at that time.   As a pilot myself this was not a balloon or other type of aircraft of my knowledge.;41.4742000000001;-73.502
