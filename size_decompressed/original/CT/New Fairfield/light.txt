Possible Hiperformance Spy Craft and Mother Ship;2008-08-27 21:11:00;1 minute;Possible Hiperformance Spy Craft and Mother Ship While standing in front of my house stargazing I happened to witness at approximately 9:11pm what I thought was a satellite. In my neighborhood it is very dark with no city lights and on a clear night you can actually see the rim of the galaxy. The object in question was flying almost due north from south. The Big Dipper is easily seen from my front yard, as is the North Star. I witnessed said object from about 10deg south of vertical until it disappeared behind some trees at about 35 deg north. The object gave off light (white in color) and it did not waiver other than to dim somewhat as it went further north. As the object crossed straight overhead I saw what looked like an aircraft strobe suddenly appear right next to it (within 1deg of arc). Aside from the strobe I could not see a craft. The strobe was regular (I saw at least 5 strobes) which allowed me to connect the dots so to speak enough so that I would gauge the craft separated from the other craft on a vector of approx. 5deg. A strobe might be used to help locate an aircraft flying at night and at high altitude for collision avoidance. I find it interesting that a satellite would be tracking due north. What makes more sense to me is that I witnessed a spy craft. If an American spy plane were to travel from the eastern seaboard it might fly over the North Pole to shorten the distance to say Russia or maybe Georgia.;41.4742000000001;-73.502
