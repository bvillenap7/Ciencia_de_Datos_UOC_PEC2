It made no noise. The sea gulls did not sense it. It was going about 200 mph. It was at about 1000 ft. It traveled out to Durham, then went up. I could see windows. Rear fins. It seemed to change shape as it passed in front of me. I am a private pilot and know that this was not a craft of this world. I have a 5 second mind blank as I saw the craft pass me. I keep seeing that moment over and over, but cannot recall what it did. It blocked that time out of my mind.I think it changed shape. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of alleged sighting may be approximate.

green fireball shaped object;2008-06-24 23:30:00;3 seconds;green fireball shaped object I was out stargazing at about 11:30 eastern time with my binoculars  it was a clezar night in a new remote spot I found outside the city. I actually was able to asee the milky way. Anyway I was looking up w my binoculars in a star cluster i saw what I thought to be a satelite. while I took the bioculars away from my face to see the object with my naked eye i lost sight of it it was heading north way in the atmosphere. It was starting to get cold I went in my truck to put on another shirt as i closed the door and walked back to my observing position I saw a huge green fireball like object very luminous object at a low altitude maybe 1000ft or less heading north I do not know what it was but it was not a meteor but it was breathtaking to say the least...;41.4568;-72.8244999999999
