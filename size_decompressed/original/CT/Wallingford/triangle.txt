Fleet of white triangular airplanes, circular center with three lights, rear again trangular.;2006-08-23 23:00:00;30 - 45 MIN;Fleet of white triangular airplanes, circular center with three lights, rear again trangular. The night was comfortable for August, despite heavy clouds all day threatening rain.  I'm not a good judge of distance, but my guess is that the cloud ceiling began at about 500 to 700 feet.  The airborne vehicle was inside the clouds, seemingly trying to hide in them.  As the atmosphere around it swirled about, different views of the ship came into sight.  Eventually, the complete outline was revealed.  The nose of the ship was gently rounded, the body, triangular with rounded corners.  The circular center had three running lights, two white and one red.  The rear section was again in a triangular shape. The ship was silent, still, completely white except for the running lights.  There was no engine sound.  As other portions of the huge cloud formation swirled,  I noticed part of another craft, exactly like the one I was watching just to the right, and then another to itâ€™s left.  As my gaze moved over the low cloud cover, I could see portions of other crafts in front of it and behind it.  The object I first noticed was part of a fleet of ships and because of the swirling masses, most of what was up there was obscured.  As far as I could see, and that distance was extremely limited, the area of sky over my head was filled with them.  Did anyone see what I saw?  Can anyone help me verify?;41.4568;-72.8244999999999
