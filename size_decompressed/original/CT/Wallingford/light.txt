Bright Round Light Moves North In Night Sky Wallingford,Connecticut No Sound;2007-09-03 20:32:00;3 -5 minutes;Bright Round Light Moves North In Night Sky Wallingford,Connecticut No Sound When we were at a families house leaving to go home I noticed in the sky from my car a commercial airliner jet go in a NorthEast Direction it was a verty clear night the stars were present also within the area of sky I was viewing then a bright white light brigher then a Star Spacestation or Satellite I have viewed both in the night sky and know what the pattern of movement is. This object was moving steady in a due North direction passing the Jetliner and my wife and child both looked up at this light which caught there attention aswell. Its possible it could be a Satillite but I have viewed Ufos before and this was very bright within the Earth Atmosphere both much higher then the Commercial Jetliner.  So I deducted what we feel its not. So What is it? i would sure love to know. There was no sound and it faded out as in continued due North. Thats my report.;41.4568;-72.8244999999999
