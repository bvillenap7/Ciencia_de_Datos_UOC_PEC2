Three Orange Circular Balls traveling in excess of 250knts heading across sky toward Durham, Ct;2007-07-07 21:30:00;5;Three Orange Circular Balls traveling in excess of 250 knts heading across sky toward Durham, Ct Round orange circle spotted approximately at 15,000 feet flying from the direction of Cheshire Connecticut over Wallingford toward Durham, CT. Three different objects were spotted in all. Two objects within 5 minutes and another about seven minutes after. There were no navigation lights that one would see with a civillian aircraft or military aircraft. It was estimated that the speed was in excess of 250knts however there was no sound at all. It appeared with the third object that an aircraft turned as if to intercept but it could not keep pace and seemed to head off toward Bradley Field (Windsor Locks, CT).;41.4568;-72.8244999999999
brightly colored flashing red green and yellow pentagon/ circular shaped object bouncing up and down in the night sky;2007-09-17 22:30:00;1 hour;brightly colored flashing red green and yellow pentagon/ circular shaped object bouncing up and down in the night sky i saw a flashing colored circular light in the night sky. I proceeded to get my binoculars and then saw the object bouncing up and down and flashing with all sorts of yellow, green , and red flashing lights, and at times emitting a bright white light from the side of the circular object. It was only one object observed. It appeared to be circular or possible pentagon shaped. I called my husband in to see, and he wasnt able to detect what it was either, and both of us were mesmerized.;41.4568;-72.8244999999999
A big circle greenish object out my window randomly dissapeared and it was low;2011-12-19 22:36:00;5 seconds;A big circle greenish object out my window randomly dissapeared and it was low I was laying in bed watching TV, and at the corner of my eye there was this circle type green thing out of my window, I got a closer look and it was kind of slightly going downward and to the right, then within 3 seconds it dissapeard out of no where. If your looking outside it was smaller than a golf ball but bigger than a pea. It was like gliding at a slow place near here and I know it wasnt a plane or helicopter because it would'nt dissapear and it was way to low to be one.;41.4568;-72.8244999999999

MY WIFE AND I WITNESSED THE EVENT TONIGHT ON SEPT, 20, 2014, AT 730 PM, WE WERE LEAVING THE WALMART PARKING LOT.  WE WERE WAITING AT THE TRAFFICE LIGHT, WHEN I LOOKED UP TO MY LEFT AT 2 OBJECTS MOVING IN OUR DIRECTION.  THEY WERE RED IN COLOR, NOT BLINKING.  WE PULLED OVER AND GOT OUT OF OUR CAR AND WATCHED THEM, THEY TRAVELING SIDE BY SIDE MOVING SLIGHTLY UP THEN DOWN.  GOING SOMEWHAT FAST, THEN THEY STOPPED TO OUR RIGHT THEN ONE DISAPPEARED, THEN 5 SECONDS LATER THE OTHER DISSAPEARED, WE THOUGHT THAT WAS IT, THEN WE SAW ANOTHER COMING FROM THE SAME DIRECTION WE SAW THE FIRST TWO HAD COME FROM.  IT WAS MOVING SAME SPEED, SAME COLOR AND WHEN IT GOT TO SAME SPOT TO OUR RIGHT IT DISSAPEARED.  THEN ANOTHER CAME SAME FROM THE DIRECTION, DID THE SAME THING.  THEN ANOTHER ONE DID SAME THING I GOT MY PHONE OUT AND WAS ABLE TO TAKE PICTURE OF 5TH ONE, I DID NOT HAVE ANYMORE ROOM ON MY PHONE TO TAKE ANOTHER PICTURE OF THE 6TH.  IT WAS AMAZING TO SEE WE WAITED AROUND TO HOPEFULLY SEE IF THERE WERE ANYMORE.  WE DID NOT SEE ANYMORE AFTERWARDS. WE BELIEVE WHAT WE SAW WERE UFOS OF SOME KIND,  THEY DID NOT MAKE ANY NOISE AND THEY DID NOT BLINK.  AND THE SPEED THEY WERE TRAVELING WAS NOT LIKE ANY AIRCRAFT,HELICOPTER OR LANTERN/FLARE THAT I HAVE EVER WITNESSED BEFORE.  THE OBJECTS MOVED FROM THE SOUTH TO THE NORTH.;41.4568;-72.8244999999999
4 glowing circular objects in the North Western sky near Meriden CT;2018-09-29 19:50:00;~4 minutes;4 glowing circular objects in the North Western sky near Meriden CT My wife called me to one of our back upstairs windows, yelling about 4 UFOs in the sky.  I can confirm that she wasn't seeing things.  She saw them appear as they were white glowing circular objects in the distance.  They made formations in a V shape,  They also were crossing paths, i.e. 2 of the objects would bump off of each other or were crossing paths - unsure.  They also changed color and glowed bright red.  They flew low and high, i.e. 2 we're behind the trees in the distance, while 2 ascended and occasionally disappeared and reappeared in our sight.   We don't believe these were aircraft as they weren't traveling in a particular direction and then they just disappeared.  We called a local airport and left a message as no one answered the phone.  My wife also heard a strange noise outside which is what got her attention to look out the window in the first place.;41.4568;-72.8244999999999
