Wallingford, CT UFO siting?  ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));2009-09-19 20:00:00;About 30 seconds;Wallingford, CT UFO siting? Okay, so I have never seen anything like this before. It was me, my boyfriend, his mom, dad and brother, and we were sitting by a fire in the back yard. The whole back yard is free of trees and you can see the sky very clearly. It wasn't cloudy. All of a sudden, by boyfriend looked up, and saw a bright light. It looked as though a spot light was shining down on us. My first thought was that it was just that, a spot light or something of the like. But then, it started to dissipate. Like it started to disappear, the light was going back to the sky. Not like it was coming from the earth but above it. We were like is that seriously happening? It just disappeared. But the light was so large, that it looked like a huge moon underneath light clouds.... i don't even know if i am explaining it well enough but it was really creepy, especially after the unidentified creature in panama. I mean people are saying its a hairless albino sloth... but who is to say its not.! Who is to say its not an alien... and now there are random sitings of strange lights in the sky. I mean its nothing like i have ever seen before, it was just this HUGE light in the sky... and it got all foggy and it was so strange.. we were all just sitting there in disbelief, like did that just happen???????????? There was no sound, it moved slightly, and there was just a huge beam coming from it.... i dont know.. were just all really freaked out right now... and i thought i should post it on something... i dont know...

Went out to bring trash to front yard and happened to look up and saw a burning red object heading north at a speed much faster then a passenger plane it was definitely on fire and not aircraft lights.   It went burning until I couldn't see it any more and I also ran to get my cell phone to video it so I have a few moments of it flying through the sky.;41.4568;-72.8244999999999
