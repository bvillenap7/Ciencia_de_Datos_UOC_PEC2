Broad daylight no clouds unobstructed view of shiny object..;2013-08-15 07:27:00;5 seconds;Broad daylight no clouds unobstructed view of shiny object. On north plains industrial rd sitting in a parking lot facing north east I looked up and there was what looked like a long cylindrical object that was shining from the sun. It was flying at a very very low rate of speed.  I looked down to open my side window and when I looked up it was gone.   There was not a cloud in the sky and nothing to obscure my field of view.   I looked all around in every quadrant of the sky and there was nothing.   No plane would be able to move as fast as this object had to be moving to get out of my view in that short amount of time.   I'm convinced.;41.4568;-72.8244999999999
