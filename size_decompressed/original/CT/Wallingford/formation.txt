Two bright lights flying very low and very close together;2009-08-23 23:45:00;5 Mins;Two bright lights flying very low and very close together I was driving on Rt. 5 in Wallingford with a friend when I looked to the east and noticed two lights in the sky. I determined they were stationary because after only 30 seconds of driving down the road they were almost behind me. Also they were flying extremly close together and very low.  I only find this odd because tonight was completely cloudy, you couldnt see a single star at that time. Strangely these two objects looked like stars, flickering and very bright. Once again let me stress that there is absolutely no way that these objects were stars, it was just too cloudy. They were flying too close to eachother, and were moving too slow for them to be airplanes.;41.4568;-72.8244999999999
