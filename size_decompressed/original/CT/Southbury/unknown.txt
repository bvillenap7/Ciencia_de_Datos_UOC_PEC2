Irregularly moving silent light source in night sky.;2015-10-18 19:15:00;7 minutes;Irregularly moving silent light source in night sky. Star gazing at 7:15pm EST 10-18-15,  I spotted a white lighted moving object traveling North North West at 75-80 degrees off the horizon, that made no sound.  At first I thought it was a slow moving satellite.  41 29 73 14. It did the impossible.  Moved in a consistent line a few degrees, one finger at arms length then abruptly stopped totally, and reversed its direction.  Then came back and went varying directions,  north,  south, east, and west each time reversing its directions.  At times it appeared to be hovering. Not real bright but easily visible. I’ve seen the Space Station several nights but it moved along in a consistent direction and pretty good speed.  This was not as bright appeared smaller, and moved more slowly. At one point it was moving with a pattern of repeating printed MMMM’s, forming somewhat of a wave pattern. Nothing I know of can maneuver in air in this manner with a sharp or reversing turn at the end of each run.  Nothing. Could have been an object buffeted by winds but very peculiar. 5-7 minutes duration of observation, then I stopped viewing.  Ran for the computer to see what this might be.;41.4824;-73.2231000000001
Transparent round or oval rows of bluish & white lights, moving quickly through our yard casting reflection below.;2021-05-25 23:23:00;7 seconds;Transparent round or oval rows of bluish & white lights, moving quickly through our yard casting reflection below. I am in my 50’s, a former drafter/designer, currently an at-home mom.  I did not see this anomaly in person.  I was inside my home when our Ring system sounded.  A few minutes later, I decided to look at the history on our Ring to see what it had detected.  I will email the video upon submitting this report.  It appears to be lights in a circular or oval shape and looks transparent.  The top row of lights are white the lower rows are bluish with one or two white lights in the lowest row.  It looks almost like a projection.  You can also see a reflection on the paved driveway below the image.  The object was moving quickly and headed directly toward our garage then appears to twist and rise when it gets to the garage as if it’s going to go over it.  Other than crickets, I hear no other sound.  It is not definitive to me whether it came through the wooded buffer between us and our neighbor, or down our driveway.  It does look more like it came from the wooded area (an approximately 20-25’ strip buffer of mature trees.)  The following morning I looked around the yard and found nothing odd.;41.4824;-73.2231000000001
