When I got a little past exit 13 I saw an object to my right over Lake Zoar. It was just above the trees. It moved in my direction, and was infront of my car. It looked exactly like a rocket ship, except it was not as long and thin. It was on the shorter, wider , with no wings, and no visible engine. It looked to be made out of metal, and the bottom almost resembled glass. It was floating with the top pointed to the left, and changed it's direction into an upright position. It made no noise at all, even though it was so close to the ground. It almost looked like it was barley in movement. It had 3 objects on the bottom of it, just like a rocket. If anything like this has ever been seen please let me know, because I feel like I am going crazy.;41.4824;-73.2231000000001
Orange light travelling with intent in sky, no fuseage, just light.;2012-01-07 20:29:00;3 minutes;Orange light travelling with intent in sky, no fuseage, just light. I saw a round light travel west then slowly turn towards the south/southeast. I was on I84 in CT between exit 14 & 15. Iwas travelling east with my 4 year old, who also saw it. I saw it against a partly cloudy sky but very bright moonlight.  It looked like an orange light, round, the whole time. But it was not partcularly large, as I had a clear view against the clouds.  It had no body other than the light (one would see the fuselage that close). I pulled over to get a better view, and watched it disappear over a hill.  I'm 34, an engineer, and always had a logical explanation for everything I've in the sky until this.  Now I'm on record. I took video with my phone but it was way too dark.;41.4824;-73.2231000000001
Southbury, CT, large black aircraft flying low near Woodbury, CT.;2013-08-13 16:00:00;4 minutes;Southbury CT large black aircraft flying low near Woodbury CT It was the end of summer, still light out around 5:30-6:00pm.  My husband was getting ready to cook on the grill, I was inside with the kids.  I heard a loud engine like airplane kinda noise.  My husband ( who is very very calm) starts shouting my name got me to come outside.  I was aggravated because I was busy and thinking this better be important .......first the engine like loud noise,   I look up in utter shock.  It all happened so fast.  About the width if our house, and as low as the highest tree tops was a freakin black aircraft..... I have NEVER see such a thing. This was no airplane... Some sort of aircraft.  Huge.. Right above my house, flying low, and the direction it was heading looked to be downwards...  But not a nosedive into the ground. I do believe there were lights.  It was so massive.  On my children we really saw this thing. I wanted to call someone but didn't know who to call.  I was speechless.   There had to be people other than my husband and I that saw this.  I considered asking neighbors but didn't.  I hope someone else saw this. It was surreal.;41.4824;-73.2231000000001
