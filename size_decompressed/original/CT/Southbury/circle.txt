We all hopped into the car me and a couple of friends were having a party out in an abandoned sand pit one night. We had a bonfire going and everything then suddenly a bright purple rounded object appeared in the sky and hovered in one spot for about 30 seconds. We all hopped into the car scared and shaking we didn't even bother to look back. A few seconds later one of my friends looked up into the sky and it was gone. We put out the fire and left as fast as we could.;41.4824;-73.2231000000001

I was heading to work east bound on I-84, I noticed a very white circular/oval shaped object traveling east to west.  The object was much whiter than a plane and left no contrail.  The shape of the object was very hard to determine because of its distance and size and just seemed like a white oval shaped object.  The size of the object looked like it would be easy to determine it's shape though so the distance is hard to determine.  It actually looked like a small circular/oval shaped white cloud moving slightly faster than a commercial airliner across the sky.  It could have been a plane flying at a lower altitude and just seemed more white because of the sun reflecting off it.  I see planes flying all the time in the morning though and this one just looked out of place.  I eventually lose sight of it and couldn't find it again. I have no picture or recording of the event because I was on the highway and don't use my phone while driving.  I'm just curious if anyone! else reported anything similar considering the path it took.;41.4824;-73.2231000000001
