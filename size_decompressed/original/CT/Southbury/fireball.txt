It looked like a hot air ballon just not as round it hovered and then moved laterally along the sky.  She watched it until we hit the intersection near the cemetery  when we returned from the cookhouse it was gone.  Sounds just like the guy in waterburys sighting.  Anyone else see it ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));41.4824;-73.2231000000001
