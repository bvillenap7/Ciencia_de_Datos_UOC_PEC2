Curious Light 	I am writing this document 8 hours after I witnessed a curious light in the sky. It was at 6:50 AM on Monday, October 23, 2000. Walking down to the bus stop, I noticed a solid, bright light in the east sky. The day before, I read a report stating that most people mistake UFO's for Venus because they do not expect the planet to be so bright. I ruled out that the light was probably Venus. I saw a second light, lower than Venus and to the right. Dimmer, and smaller, but bright nonetheless, and solid. 	I looked at the sky with concentration. Blue, not a cloud in sight for miles, everything perfectly clear. I looked at the moon which appeared to be in the south. It was a crescent moon, and looked light a crooked smile. 	This is when I saw the light. A bright, flickering object in the sky off in the distance. It was on the left side, lower than Venus, to create an equilateral triangle. I stopped and stared at the UFO, it clearly wasn't a planet, or an airplane. In fact as I looked at the object, I figured that it was blinking about 4 times a second. The entire object wasn't blinking. It had other lights, and only a portion of lights, on the bottom half of it, were blinking. I wasn't walking anymore, and noticed that it was moving back and forth slowly and unsteadily. 	Then came an airplane. In a relative distance to the UFO. Dark, with those slow blinking lights that anyone can spot and identify. A bird flew by, plainly. A bird nor an airplane, nor a planet can be this strange object I saw in the sky today, that formed a triangle with 2 (what I believe were) planets. 	I am very skeptical about this strange light being anything other than a light, or an object in the sky. But that strange, rapidly blinking light is unexplainable. I have seen strange lights in the sky before, but this is the first time I believe it couldn't be anything else, not a flare, a plane, a planet, the moon, a balloon, or spotlight. It was some sort of craft. This is a real mystery.;41.4824;-73.2231000000001
Bright light sparked across the sky and disappeared.;2018-12-24 21:30:00;3 seconds;Bright light sparked across the sky and disappeared. I was driving in the car with my husband and noticed a very bright light in the sky that was moving very fast with sparks behind it.  It made an arch shape, zoomed off and disappeared.  It was unlike anything Iâ€™ve ever seen before.  It only lasted a few seconds and by the time my husband looked up it vanished.;41.4824;-73.2231000000001
