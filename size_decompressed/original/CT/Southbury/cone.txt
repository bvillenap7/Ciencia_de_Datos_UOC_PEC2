Cone shaped bright white light - gradually disappeared / resembled a flashlight pointing down.;2009-09-19 19:52:00;30 seconds;Cone shaped bright white light - gradually disappeared / resembled a flashlight pointing down from the sky My husband and I were camping in Southbury, CT.  At exactly 7:52pm, I called our son.  As the phone was dialing, my husband and I noticed a white oval light with a cone shaped light coming out of it.  It appeared as though a large flashlight was shining down on us.  The sky was clear. It was a beautiful night. We were watching planes in the sky, and we know that this was no plane.  It did not move.  The light slowly disappeared.  We never saw anything like it. We are not nuts.   There was a group of younger college age students next to us. We heard them talking about it, and we saw them looking up. They were drinking, so they may not report it at all. There were appx. 10 of them over there looking at the light.  After it disappeared, there was nothing remaining.  There was no aircraft of any kind in that area. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));41.4824;-73.2231000000001
