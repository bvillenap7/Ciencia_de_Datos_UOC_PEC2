Griswold, CT, strange lights and shapes.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a sighting of one of the three bright planets in the E sky.  PD));2012-09-24 04:00:00;1+ hour;Griswold ct strange lights and shapes I stayed up late as usual, as I went to turn off my television, around 4am I looked out the window and I seen a very bright light. It looked strange so I went into the bathroom and looked outside the window and noticed a circle shape with a prism like light coming from it with white being the body and green to red going upwards. I awake my husband and I grab the binoculars and opened the window. I was in amazement , the second I looked threw the lens, I seen what looked like the white circle was actually a lot of separate at least 1,000+ desperate lights all close together forming the circle shape I was seeing. Then all of a sudden one separated from the bunch then floated back and once again out and back. Then it finally moved away and started spreading out in a downward position like a triangle. Once again with the green and red. The multiple lights that where in the circle shape moved back and forth to and from the separated light. It is 5:22am and it is ! still there.
