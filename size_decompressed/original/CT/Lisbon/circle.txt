I was in my fathers truck at sunset when I and my father witnessed a strange object zoom across the sky, which took only 3seconds.  Then it stopped for about 2 seconds and disappeared..  I was hysterical when I realized what just happened.  The object was bright but it had a circular gray out- line and center.  Also, we were on a back rode that was in the woods.
