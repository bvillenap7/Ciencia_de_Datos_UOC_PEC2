It was May 19, 2002 at around 2:55PM, I was sitting by myself on the front steps of a multi family house that I owned in Lisbon, CT, just south of Jewett City, CT. I just happened to look up & noticed an object passing directly overhead, not much higher than the tree tops. It was moving incredibly fast & did not make a sound. When I first noticed it, it was directly overhead & it had a round, black underside, which appeared as a black circular disk. As it passed heading west I got a good look at the object. It had a smooth oval shape & was silvery metallic in color. The sun was glinting off the object. It went just over the tree tops & was quickly out of view. The best thing I can think of to compare it to is an Airstream Trailer, only more round, with no visible windows & with a dark, frying pan like bottom. I served in the US Air Force & US Army Reserves 1982-1991. Part of my military occupational specialty entailed reporting to the National Security Agency (NSA) on Soviet & East German Air Force activity, including aircraft speeds & descriptions. I held a top secret security clearance. This object was heading in the direction of a hydro-electric plant about five miles away in Baltic, CT. I had a friend who had told me that he & others had seen such an object hovering over the hydro-electric plant. I heard that some other people in Southeastern Connecticut had witnessed an unidentified object in the sky that day, but I have not been able to find any accounts of this on-line that coincide with the date of my sighting. I took a photograph of the area where the object had passed. I drew a picture of the object into the photo using computer graphics & notated the date.;41.6062;-71.9795
