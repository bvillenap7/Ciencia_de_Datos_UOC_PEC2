10 red orange orbs flying across New Canaan;2013-11-28 18:30:00;45 minutes;10 red orange orbs flying across New Canaan It was approximately 6:30 pm on Thanksgiving.  My husband was walking our dog. He came to the front door and asked me to come outside and check out “these weird lights”.  I saw 3 bright red/orange orbs moving across the sky (moving west to east).  They were in a perfect line moving at the same speed on the same path.  They were completely silent and no other planes were flying around.   They appeared to be about 700-1,000 feet altitude. My husband said he saw 4 orbs initially, but one drop down from the line slowly.  When they passed over the house, we went to the back yard to continue the watch them.   Then, one at a time they appeared to be ascending upward and they disappeared.  We ran back to the front of the house and 2 more appeared coming from the same direction (west to east), at the same speed, on the same path.  Again, they passed over the house, we ran to the backyard, they ascended, and disappeared.   This occurred 2 more time…10 orbs in total. I recorded some! of them on my phone but it is not very clear. There were 6 witnesses (my husband, in-laws, sister-in-law, and my son. I cannot explain what it was and I am really freaked out by the event.;41.1519;-73.5070999999999
