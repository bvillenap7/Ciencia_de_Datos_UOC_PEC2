I was driving to a friends house to return an bass amp comming back from a weekend in Boston.  I missed the exit that I would have normally taken to get to his house so I ended up going a different way.  As I came up to a 3 way stop that was well know to me it began to lightly hail.  I was listening to a cassette on my tape player the song was Lifeboy by a band called Phish.  Then I saw it.. a dark shape about 50 ft long hovering silently about 30 ft in the air above the house directly infront of the stop sign I was stopping for.  The object had three clear white lights that were attached to the bottom of this giant floating object and they were searching the ground for something.  I could see the lights themselves not just what was eminating from them. I was confused by what I was seeing because I was not seeing something that I did not think it could be real, but it was as real as anything i have ever seen before or since.  The experience did not last long because I turned a hard left to go to my friends house not knowing if I was about to be abducted or something.  I returned to the same location as I drove home about 3 minutes later and it was as if nothing had ever been there. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));41.1519;-73.5070999999999
