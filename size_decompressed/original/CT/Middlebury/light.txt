 I and 3 others observed 4 lights in the sky.;2020-05-24 21:00:00;~1 hour;On May 24th, 2020, myself and 3 others observed 4 lights in the sky.  One was very active, seeming to have flashing lights in blue and red colors, with an occasional whistle light seeming to beam in an upward direction.  The other 3 seemed more stationary, and were flashing.  The more active one was making non linear movements in the sky, sort of dancing or going up, down, left, right and in circular motions not in any particular order.  We watched it for about an hour.  When I went to go check again at about 2300 all 4 were gone.  The most active one as described, seemed to be doing something and the other 3 UFO were not as active as far as moving.  They were positioned by twos, at an angle from each other. Imagine just the box portion of the Big Dipper, but in a diamond shape.  They had to be miles apart but seemed as if maybe the stationary ones were monitoring the active one.  We did witness a small red light just below the two on the left that appeared and immediately vanished.;41.5381;-73.1114
