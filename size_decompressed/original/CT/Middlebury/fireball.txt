I called him on his cell phone to ask him a question, when he answered he asked me to look at all those strange lights on left. I thought they were towers, like cell phone towers or something. If you use the lights as a guide to the top of the tower. They were all uneven and very bright. They were not blinking and they way lower then planes.  The lights did not move at all. They just sat there. I insisted they were towers. He told me they weren't. 15 to 20 minutes later, he went back by the spot and the lights were gone. Today 3days later i decided to go by during day light. There is no towers what so ever. There is nothing there that can produce those lights.;41.5381;-73.1114
