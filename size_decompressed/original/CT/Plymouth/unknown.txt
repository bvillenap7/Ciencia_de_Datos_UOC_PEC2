Slow moving star like object;2007-06-24 03:00:00;30 seconds;Slow moving star like object Hello 	I smoke outside of the house, and I went outside at about 3:00 to have a cigarette with my wife. She was going to bed, I stay up late because I work second shift. I always look up at the stars and no kidding I saw a star, about the same size of most of the other stars, moving across the sky. It was moving straight and headed from Plymouth, CT. toward Southington, CT. 	This is about the best Way for me to describe its direction. Also I told my wife I saw this, but she didnâ€™t look.;41.6636;-73.042
