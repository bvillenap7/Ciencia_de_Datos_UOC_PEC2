A Glow in the Sky......;2002-10-02 06:34:00;23 seconds;A Glow in the Sky...... I was standing outside of my home this morning, waiting for my school bus to arrive. I looked up at the sky and saw a large, egg shaped, glowing orb in the sky. It slowly moved around in a clockwise motion, as if it was hovering over or searching for a specific object. It was glowing very brightly, and that made it hard to get a clear view at the object. I checked the sky and saw that the sun was not yet up, so it could not have been that. It lasted for about 20 seconds (23estimate) and then disappeared, moving faster than I have ever seen anything move before.;41.3962;-72.7809
