Two strange lights hovered above the surface of a lake, broke the surface, and disappeared.;2008-02-19 11:00:00;2 minutes;Two strange lights hovered above the surface of a lake, broke the surface, and disappeared. It was a very windy morning, but there wasn't a cloud in the sky, and the sun was shining brightly.  I was inside standing by the kerosene heater, and I was thinking about yesterday.  I heard geese squawking outside so looked up to look out the window toward the lake.  The geese were flying just shy of the surface of the lake but they weren’t what caught my eye.  The waves were surprisingly rough because of the wind, and hovering above the waves were two blue lights.  One light on the right was slightly higher than the other. The two lights were separated by at least a foot.  I couldn’t take my eyes off them.    I ran to the sliding glass door and pressed myself up against the glass to make sure I wasn’t hallucinating.  I yelled at my mom for her to look.  She ignored me.    They hovered slowly forward, and then, suddenly the lights as if reacting to something, dropped and broke the surface of the water.  It went under.  I slipped on my shoes and ran outside.  I watched the surface of the lake for at least a half hour.  The lights didn’t resurface.  I’m still waiting for it to come back up. Whatever it was, it was small, and the weirdest thing I’ve ever seen in my life.;41.3253;-72.2108
