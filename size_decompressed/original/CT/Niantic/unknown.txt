flashing light with incredible speed and manuverability;2003-07-05 01:30:00;30-45 sec;flashing light with incredible speed and manuverability I was anchored in my boat 4 miles offshore about 500 yards from bartlets light. It was 8:30pm when we arrived.At that time the visibilty in the fog was about a half mile as I could just barely see the white light on the light tower.By 10:00 pm the visibility went down to zero.We were the only boat around as the other 3 left because of the fog.We were planning on fishing all night so it didn`t matter to us.About 1:00 am,my partner went to the front of the boat to lay down.I stayed in the back in my chair,still fishing.About 10 minutes went by and I happend to look up towards the sky and saw a green flashing light.My first thought was the fog was just thick at low-level and I could see up some,and I could see an airplane so I began to look for stars or clouds,but could see nothing else but this green flashing light.After about 10 seconds this flashing light began to zip from left to right,with each zig-zag a little higher or lower than the previous.That began to freek me out because I`ve never seen anything move like that or that fast in the air before.I called for my partner who was up immediatly.He saw it and we watched it as It headed straight down towards the water, again, very fast.I thought it was going into the water,but it stopped at water level and the light was stationary as to be in a *hover*.At that time it was in front of us,just to our left.After a few seconds of the hover it began to move slowly by us on our left,still at water level.After it went by and was off the back of the boat we saw it go straight up,only about 3 blinks of the light,then it was gone.He said to me WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT! I have no explanation as the way and the speed at which it darted and being the visibility, it had to be within 100 yards of me,and neither of us heard a sound,and it was dead calm out there. I am now a believer. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at length, and he seemed to us to be exceptionally serious-minded and credible.  PD));41.3253;-72.2108
