Hello,  Last night (12/5/2016) at 8:05 p.m., in Niantic, Connecticut, I saw a craft in the sky that maneuvered unlike anything I have seen in my 30 years of life.   The aerial craft was low, flying traveling at an incredible speed.  It was making an “S” shape in the sky and had a steady red light on it.  It was flying from East to West.   I saw a green light blink twice from it with no steady interval.   I stepped out onto Main Street to fallow it.  I thought about taking out my phone to capture it, but I couldn’t take my eye off of it.  I was struck with fear and awe.   Then it did a 180, shot back to the east, and shot straight down into the estuary several blocks away.   I was not on any drugs and had only had half a beer.;41.3253;-72.2108
