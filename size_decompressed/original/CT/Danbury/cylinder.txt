It was cylander shaped with lights all around. Then i noticed 4 others. These were just moving very slowly. I was wondering if there were any other reports.;41.3989831460675;-73.4542859550562
A hazy object hidden in clouds just all of a sudden dissapeared.;1998-03-15 20:30:00;5 seconds;A hazy object hidden in clouds just all of a sudden dissapeared. It happened when there was still snow on the ground. It happened above the state prison in Danbury, Ct. I was driving by the prison with my family and I was sitting in the back seat when i looked out the window and saw about 3 or 4 disk shaped clouds. They looked weird so I stared at them. About 5 seconds later, one of the Clouds dissapeared. It was gone. There was no trace of where it went. The other clouds stayed there. Just then I told my parents what I saw and they laughed and said I was crazy. I called my mom later that night and she believed me because she also had an encounter. That is all there is.;41.3989831460675;-73.4542859550562
