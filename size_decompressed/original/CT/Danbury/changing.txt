Atom-looking sphere sighted in Danbury, CT, changed colors and appeared and disappeared from the sky.  ((anonymous report));2018-11-22 23:30:00;10 minutes;Atom-looking sphere sighted in Danbury, CT, changed colors and appeared and disappeared from the sky. Saw this very bright light in the sky and it seemed to change colors, took out my camera which has a very good zoom and zoomed in as far as it went.  When looking at it closely, it was a very bright sphere, that kept changing colors and disappearing every 5 seconds. Everytime it disappeared, it took the form of an atom.  The color change and disappearance were very fast.  I was amazed with the shape it had, looked like an atom, full of circles around it..  I have a couple of videos!
