As we were going down hawley rd. near Saint Gregory's Church we saw 4 bright lights flying in a northern direction towards new milford.  All lights we white, not blinking, very bright.  no noise.  we pulled into saint gregory's church parking lot so we could watch it.  it appeared to descend in a northern path, not fade off in the distance but actually descend.  Then when it got over the trees in the north it was gone.;41.3989831460675;-73.4542859550562
