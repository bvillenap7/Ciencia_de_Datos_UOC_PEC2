10-12 red-orange glowing objects flying slowly from south to north in clusters of two or three.;2013-08-31 22:30:00;10 minutes;10-12 red-orange glowing objects flying slowly from south to north in clusters of two or three. I noticed a red-orange object moving slowly from the south towards our home in Danbury. It seems to be preceded by a halo effect in the front of the object. It quietly moved closer as I tried to discern what it was, and then saw another coming from the same direction. I assumed at first it was a helicopter, but I heard no sound.  I followed as they flew over our home, in silence, then noticed another cluster of three approaching from the same direction. In the meanwhile one of the first of the objects had moved significantly higher in the sky. By the time the next group of two or three were approaching I called my husband to come and see. After observing for a minute, he ran in to get his iPad and film it. (Haven’t seen it yet.)  It continued for another 7 or 8 minutes. I lost count of how many but I’d estimate 10 – 12 objects, all appearing the same, over the course of 10 – 15 minutes.;41.3989831460675;-73.4542859550562
A group of neon-red lights blinking with white lights in the shape of a rectangle descending toward the horizon.;2015-02-20 18:30:00;20 seconds;A group of neon-red lights blinking with white lights in the shape of a rectangle descending toward the horizon. I saw a group of extremely bright red lights in what looked like two rows - Approximately 10 lights in all.  The red lights were almost neon colored red and were blinking on and off with white lights.  The object looked to be rectangular with the short end of the rectangle to the horizon and the longer ends facing up the whole thing being at approximately a 45 degree angle.  It was descending toward the horizon at a fairly rapid pace - thought not extremely fast.  The object was very far away, but still looked large.  I watched it descend until the tree-line obstructed the view.  Although the lights looked similar to aircraft lights, they were MUCH brighter, and a much more brilliant shade of red.  If it was an aircraft, I've never seen one with this many lights on it before.;41.3989831460675;-73.4542859550562
