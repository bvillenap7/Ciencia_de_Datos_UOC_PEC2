I saw a bright blue-ish sphere light though not even 100 feet away from me slowly flying over the night sky.   There was just this one light that at a first glance one would think its a star but it was slowly gliding in the middle of my town and the unusual thing about it is it made no sound.   If it was a plane of some sort, anyone would have heard turbulence but it was silent as the night and awe like.   I have always been a believer but honestly I thought I would have never seen this in my lifetime.;41.3989831460675;-73.4542859550562
White orb hovers for 10 minutes over Danbury Airport.;2014-04-06 17:45:00;10 minutes;White Orb hovers for 10 minutes over Danbury Airport. I live next to Danbury airport, and I was sitting on my porch sky watching, trying the “Robert Bingham - Stephen Greer/ CE5” method of initiating contact with an ET vehicle.   After maybe 10 minutes of sky watching (and I am an aviator, so I know aircraft types), I see a small white orb high in the sky, but I initially think it's a commercial jet at around 35,000', because I see a lot of those.   But the object moves very slowly and there are no contrails, and the object doesn't get any bigger (perhaps barely - I did notice what appeared to be a possible division or morphing of the orb).  In fact, it looked like it could have been a tiny cloud or balloon, but there was not a cloud in the sky, and a balloon would have been blown about by the light wind.   This object hovered, and came to within a 1/2 mile at perhaps 3-5,000', and remained stationary for at least 5 minutes.   I called to my neighbor, who also witnessed the white orb.  It slowly moved across a part of the sky above the airport, while several commercial aircraft flew about their designated routes, oblivious to its presence.   Anyway, my housemate came home, and he witnessed it too, as it started to move away, slowly at first, and then we saw it shoot rapidly up towards orbit.   I can saw without a doubt that this had to be either a military recon drone (unlikely), or an ET probe (or whatever kind of instrument they send when a mental CE5 contact is initiated - if that is what it was responding to).;41.3989831460675;-73.4542859550562
