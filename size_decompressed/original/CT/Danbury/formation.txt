We saw a number of amber/redish lights up in the sky. It was cloudy out, so these were the only lights in the sky.  They were moving towards the right, they rotated, they turned on and off.  At one point 4 of them seemed to form a triangle.  We have a video.  Then they just disappeared.;41.3989831460675;-73.4542859550562
