Westbound towards New York class B airspace Hudson River VFR corridor, ident signal from Carmel VOR which was being used for navigation, became very unreadable due to static. I was within Danbury Airport class D airspace, and in contact with their control tower. Directly at twelve O'clock a large boomerang shaped object leaving a trail of what seemed vapor or fog, and a light glow around it approached our aircraft. We were flying a V35  Bonanza, altitude 3000MSL 2400AGL Groundspeed 130knots. No wake turbulence was experienced. Object flying at very slow speed. No navigation/position/anti collision lights. No traffic advisories from air traffic control. As the object positioned itself overhead, some type of observation ports or windows were noticed under the apex or tip of the boomerang. At this point the object made an incredible(as if the whole thing was not incredible enough up to this moment) high rate of speed climb until the object was no longer visible. Name is being withheld for the same reason I did not contact Danbury tower or New York approach to verify if they had seen what I just had. Did not report an incident report for a near miss. My wife who was always skeptical of these things, is now a changed person, and so am I.;41.3989831460675;-73.4542859550562
