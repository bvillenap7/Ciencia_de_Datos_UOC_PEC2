I threw rocks at a UFO for about a half an hour;1988-08-01 22:00:00;45 minutes;I threw rocks at a UFO for about a half an hour What accrued happened in Danbury Connecticut on Newtown Rd. It was very dark area with only a couple of city light poles that were on. There were a couple of stores in that area but they were all closed. There are a lot of hills in this area so it further darkens the area. I was about eighteen years old at the time. My friend and I were working at a Burger King until about 10 pm. We went outside to wait for a ride and we were talking. We went across the street where there was a pay phone that I was going to use to call to see where our ride was and I noticed that where we just walked from was a seeming to be round object just hovering in the air about 30 feet not very high no real noise except for humming. I felt and heard a humming just like an electrical sub station, there’s ones in every town. I felt my hairs standing up. The object was about the size of the Burger King, just a little wider. There were about eight, two foot wide bulbs around the round object. My friend and I walked under it at an angle and tried to make out the shape with the stars since it was the only light above, there was no moon and the stars were almost not visible. We first thought it was a hot air balloon with lights on the bottom but with the little stars that were out, we couldn’t see how high it exactly was, but we knew it wasn’t high like a balloon. I need to say this, over the years I’ve read a lot about of what other people have written about what they saw, and what’s different about mine, is that I think my friend and I are the only dumb asses that threw rocks and tar from the road at it for about a good half an hour. And we didn’t even hear the rocks fall back on the ground and we didn’t hear it hit the object. After about half an hour of throwing rocks at it we watched it slowly rise up then whoosh, it went up fast, in like a couple of seconds it shot up, we saw the lights get closer together, get smaller, and dim, in a matter of two to three seconds. My take on why it left so abruptly, is that I think they were going to abduct us until they found out they’d have serious problems with the two dumb asses that were throwing rocks at them. Just kidding. One more thing, there is one more witness, this was a little strange, it was my ride which happened to be my mom. She didn’t see it there, but at her job which happens to be on the other side of the hill / small mountain, at the Davis and Geck parking lot. We talked about it a few days after it happened, because we ended up walking home. She said she was afraid of it and went back inside to get someone to walk her back to he car. It happened at night, and that is all I know. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));41.3989831460675;-73.4542859550562
Multiple flashing white lights...;2001-08-27 20:30:00;45 sec;Multiple flashing white lights... While watching the Monday night football game on 08/27/01 at 20:30:00 I witnessed one flashing white light out my bedroom window at 280°. I live in an area where privet airplane traffic fly right over the house in route to or taking off from the Danbury airport.  I watched kind of surprised, it was foggy nevertheless you could see the bright white flashing light fine, I thought it was an airplane. This went on for about eight to ten seconds. Shortly thereafter the sky lit up there were flashing white lights all over the place sporadically and extremely fast then at one point throughout what was happening they were sequential and lighting up all together diagonally. I called my wife upstairs she witnessed the spectacle for about ten seconds. Then like nothing happened they were gone. I don't know, I know I'm not crazy I've never seen anything like this in my life. I took a ride in my car to see if others witnessed what I had, there were plenty of people out however all were just going about their business. My wife calleed the Danbury Airport She actually talked with someone in the control tower, she was told there were no aircraft in that location at that time. There was one aircraft in the sky located at 180°.;41.3989831460675;-73.4542859550562

15-18 orange circular objects w/o sound moving from n to ne.;2013-08-17 22:00:00;8 minutes;15-18 orange circular objects w/o sound moving from n to ne @ 22:00 I noticed brightly colored orange orbs moving very slowly w/o any sound.  Lights.. were the size of small peas. There were about 15 or twenty of them and they were in groups of two and three moving amongst themselves but still staying in cluster, they would change speed and direction several times.   I ran inside got cell phone to take pics which didn't show much at all.  I then contacted you people.   It's funny you always wish to see this type of thing and then tell others in turn they think your nuts. That's fine with me.  I KNOW WHAT I SAW WAS NOT A GROUP OF PLANES OR FLARES what else I know not !!!!;41.3989831460675;-73.4542859550562

Craft flew overhead in Danbury, CT, just past midnight.  ((anonymous report));2018-06-10 00:10:00;15 seconds;Craft flew overhead in Danbury, CT, just past midnight. We were driving down I-84 on the way home from the movie theater.  The movie ended at roughly midnight.  I was sitting in the front passenger seat.  As we were driving I noticed an odd light in the sky that appeared to be moving towards us.  As it moved closer, I noticed it was flying low, far too low for a plane but much too big to be a drone.  It appeared to be circular in shape, as it definitely had a rounded back but the front was harder to distinguish.  It flew directly over our heads then proceeded on in the other direction, where we could see the light from the craft move further and further way at an increasing speed.
