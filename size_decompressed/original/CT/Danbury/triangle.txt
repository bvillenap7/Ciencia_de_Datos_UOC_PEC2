For about a few hours, and it is STILL continuing, there is an extremely bright triangle to the left of the moon.  ((Celestial body??));2007-10-05 05:33:00;Still happening;For about a few hours, and it is STILL continuing, there is an extremely bright triangle to the left of the moon, that has barely moved.   It is not a plane, nor a satellite, due to it's size, brightness, and stillness.   It is directly next to the moon, and is moving only a little bit. ((NUFORC Note:  Probably a celestial body, we assume.  PD));41.3989831460675;-73.4542859550562
Large Bright Lights at the end of a Wingtip, humming vibration felt through the air!;2018-06-04 22:30:00;2 minutes;Large Bright Lights at the end of a Wingtip, humming vibration felt through the air! Stood out my deck at around 22:30 hrs ,when I looked up and saw 2 bright lights, at first I thought it was the lights at the wingtip of a massive Jumbo Jet going to crash and my first instinct was to run in and get my family out due to an imminent plane crash.  Then for a minute or so it turned at an angle and what looked like even brighter lights (like after burners of a jet propulsion system) it turned and very quietly disappeared into the clear skies!  There was a slight humming sound and I could feel an uneasy vibration in the air.  This felt like one was standing in front of a large Airbus A380 coming head on towards you, but with an eerie humming sound! Spooked for sure!;41.3989831460675;-73.4542859550562

It started to slowly sink below the tree line.  Then rise up quickly then sunk down again and just disappeared;41.3989831460675;-73.4542859550562
