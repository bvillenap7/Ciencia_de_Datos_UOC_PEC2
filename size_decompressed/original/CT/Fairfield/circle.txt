bright circualr object appeared to rotate horizontally;2006-01-07 13:00:00;unknown;bright circualr object appeared to rotate horizontally time of sighting is an estimate. I saw a roundish object in the sky as I was entering a grocery store on Black Rock Turnpike. I stopped breifly to look at it longer. It looked as if it was rotating. it was either bright white or of reflective material. I would also estimate it's size to be about the same as a small plane. OTHER INFO: I'm pretty sure that this was the same object I had seen in this sky before. I was eating at a fast food place on the same street about a block away. I was able to monitor the object with my naked eyes for the duration of it's visibility. also in that sighting, it traveled slowly, stopped, changed direction then dissapeared. I am unable to tell you what day it was but it may have been early spring 2005 or 2004. I remember it was cold out. About me. I tend to be very observant. I spotted a cockrach at 20 feet while driving through D.C. if that makes sense to you. I always keep an eye open for something out of the ordinary. I am also a skeptic and look for possible explanations. this may have been a silver mylar party balloon and it was twirling up in the sky. but I think it was too big to be that. party ballons are 18 and this was much larger. I can't quite remember if it had a haze around it. I was hoping someone else spotted this thing, it was a busy afternoon.
