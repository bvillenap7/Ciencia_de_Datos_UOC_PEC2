I was looking at horizon level when this beautiful big(to my eyes the size of a large beach or basketball) bluegreen fireball fell diagonally across the sky. This is the second time in my life I witnessed this. The last time was around 1967 in broad daylight.  At the time I assumed it was a meteorite, and thought the same thing last night, but when I typed in bluegreen fireball on the search in my computer your site came up.  Because of the lateness of the hour I'm not aware of any other witnesses. It was very definitely a ball, but there were flashes all around it almost like a rotary blade.It was visual stunning, but frightened me because of all the stupid nuclear and terrorist talk your bombarded with these days!Afterward, I just assumed it was a meteor. I would like to know if it was. I would greatly appreciate it if you would let me know. Thanks.

Large yellow/white fireball seen in fairfield;2012-07-11 23:43:00;3 seconds;large yellow/white fireball seen in fairfield I saw a large meteor? white/yellow 3x size of full moon coming from southeast toward  northwest direction.  It was moving horizontally and appeared to be surrounded by sparks. It had a long tail at the end.  The sky was cloudy, so I'm assuming it was travelling low in the sky beneath the clouds, otherwise I would'nt have seen it.  My wife was talking to me in the backyard while I was looking up at the sky.  She was facing in the opposite direction, by the time she turned to look it was gone.;41.176072;-73.2593000000001
