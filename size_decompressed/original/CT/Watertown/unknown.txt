Three shining orbs spotted over farmland by young woman on walk.;2011-07-15 21:00:00;5 minutes;Three shining orbs spotted over farmland by young woman on walk It was during the summer time.  I was outside and had gone for a late walk around the neighborhood.   My house is on top of a hill and I have this wide, open view of farmland with nothing around.   As I was walking up my driveway I noticed three shining bright lights in the distance over the farms, maybe a little further back.   I stopped immediately and just stared at them.  At first, I thought it was just a plane, or a few of them, since there's a lot of small planes that fly near my home.  But I noticed that these were not moving.  They were almost floating there and they wouldn't budge.  I tried to think of any possible explanation but there wasn't any.  There are no cell towers or lights of any kind in that direction, it's all farmland and a few houses.   I stood watching them for a good five minutes, and then slowly I saw them almost fidget. That's the best way I can describe it.  I had been so distracted that I hadn't bothered trying to get a photo until the last mi! nute.  I looked down at my phone to turn on the camera and when I looked up, they were gone. It was as if they just disappeared.  I literally looked down for a split second.  There was no way that could've been any type of plane because I would've seen the lights fade away.   They just completely disappeared. I had never experienced anything like this ever before. I always believed in life on other planets, but I never really believed in UFO sightings.  Until, obviously, I had one of my own. I can still see the lights clearly in my head like it was yesterday.   It was the strangest thing I have ever experienced. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.
