Noticed a strange group of lights that started off as a singular red light, and moved from the center red light outwards to left and right, four lights on either side, starting from the center out, red being the center, it went green, orange, blue. In a constant pattern. Moved EXTREMELY slowly, not a satellite by any means, or a plane, because it stood still for approximatley 20 min.
