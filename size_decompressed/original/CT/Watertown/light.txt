Strange Hovering Light - Noticed and Approached Us;1995-05-06 21:00:00;2 minutes;Strange Hovering Light - Noticed and Approached Us This is a while back but I remember it quite well.  Back in 2005 my sister was driving home from some late night dinner with my mother and as we drove down our street I saw a light at the end of the street over a house just above the trees about two feet above. I automatically assumed that it was a airplane flying low at night and the perspective was throwing off the actual height. So my sister stopped to get the mail at the bottom of our 150 ft driveway. I stared and then noticed the light was not moving. Just as a mentioned this to my mother and sister the light began to zip smoothly towards us. My sister did not pull up the driveway, but my mother began to panic and said to get up the driveway. My heart began to race since this light as now apparently only 2 feet above the treeline! As we pulled in the garage I looked overhead and saw the light skirt over the tops of the trees and then we were in the garage. As I ran inside to look out the windows, the object had left and that was the end of the excitement. To date my mother doesn't talk about it because she doesn't want people to think she is crazy.

Formation of approx 9 orange lights flew in formation over Watertown.  Appeared to hover then moved on.  ((anonymous report));2016-06-22 21:50:00;2 minutes;A formation of approx. 9 orange lights flew in formation over Watertown.  Appeared to hover then moved on.  One larger light followed in the back of the formation. There was no sound.  They flew vertically across the sky after hovering for what seemed like a few seconds. I am not sure if this has any relation but a few hours earlier I was in the same location and saw two seperate birds acting very erratic.  One was trying to fly through a car window repeatedly and the other was trying to fly through a window on the building.  Very strange.  I has forgotten about it until now.  Again..exact same location just a few hours later. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));41.6057;-73.1183000000001

One white light moved from the south horizon to the north horizon, then paused.  A stationary light  in that area then traveled from the north to the south, then turned to the southwest horizon.  This passed by another stationary light in the southwest horizon, which then traveled to the east horizon.  All white light, previously stationary, no color or blinking lights.  Not planes or helicopters, at least one appeared to change directions.;41.6057;-73.1183000000001
