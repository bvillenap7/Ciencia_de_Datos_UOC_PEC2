At first my brother (age 20) called me outside because he said he saw a UFO. I didn't quite believe him until a few seconds later he came inside and dragged me out. I couldn't tell exatly how many lights where on it, but there appeared to be 3 in a triangular shape in the darkest yellow I have ever seen on an aircraft. It didn't appear to be moving and my other brother (age 18) got our telescope. As he was gone I watched the object move quickly to the left behind some trees. It didn't dart across very fast but moved a lot faster than any plane I had seen before, and it had done this after not moving for quite a while. When my brother came out we could barely make it out behind the trees. It was then that we noticed another object looking like the other that was not there just a second before. We weren't looking when it appeared but it must have moved very fast to its position as 3 of us were watching the skies. We ran down our driveway with the telescope so we could see behind the trees and get a good look at the objects, but once we got down, they were no where to be found. We waiting for about 40 minutes but there were no signs of any others. It was then that I came in I searched for a UFO Reporting Center.;41.6057;-73.1183000000001
Triangular shaped object in the southwestern sky with white, red and green lcd lights.;2010-11-11 23:15:00;20;Triangular shaped object in the southwestern sky with white, red and green lcd lights. Driving back from a late night run to the grocery store, I saw a triangular shaped object in the southwestern sky.  Brilliant night lots of stars but this was clearly some sort of craft.  It had white, red and green LCD lights and hovered in the sky, then quickly retreated and hovered again.  It seemed capable of moving a fast speeds and then would just stop and hover.;41.6057;-73.1183000000001
