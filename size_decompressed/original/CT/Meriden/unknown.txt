It looked similar to the spaceship on the Boston album.  It was beautiful, and I saw it partially obscured by clouds in the sky.  I was so scared (I was 5 at the time) that I ran inside my apartment building and locked the main entrance door and went to my apartment. 1 LARGE object in the sky, and, as I said, similar in look to the spaceship on the cover of the Boston album(their first, and quite a good one, I might add!).  By the way, I had never seen the Boston album prior to that (I do not know if it was even released at the time).  When I saw the Boston album for the first time, I was immediately reminded of what I had seen years before.  Anyway, there was 1 object, beautiful, with colored lights, and maybe windows.  That's all I recall.  I saw no movement in the object.  I saw it in the sky, looked at it, and got VERY frightened and ran inside.  It was immense in size, because it was high enough to be partially obscured by cumulonimbus clouds that were present, but those clouds offered excellent reference as to the object's size.  In the seconds I looked at the object, it did not move.  Then I ran in and locked the door.  As I said in my previous report, I would just like to document my sighting in case there were other sightings in that area at that time.;41.5343333333334;-72.8016666666666
A ship flew right over my head;2004-08-16 10:30:00;5 Min;A ship flew right over my head We were walking down the street to the store and looking at the sky at whatever. A Large object flew so low above us we coulda thrown a a rock at it.  It looked like half a hexagon with a long tube type front.  It had a blue light at the front of the tube and red blinking lights at the front corners of the hexagon.  It flew above us at a pace of (I would guess) 15 mph we watched it fly away behind the trees.  We may of saw several small glowing sphere ships around the area that were stationary but we're not positive about those;41.5343333333334;-72.8016666666666

The object hovered for about 3 mins in the same place while flashing a very bright white.  Almost seemed to be reflecting off of the object and not a light as the lights on the jet were not visible and the flashing from the object was erratic.  Object seemed to be gray when not flashing produced no noise.  After the 3 mins, it started to move in the same direction as the jet almost looked to be following it.;41.5343333333334;-72.8016666666666
