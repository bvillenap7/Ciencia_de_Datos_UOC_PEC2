Bright object moving almost like a circuliar rocket.;2002-05-08 17:00:00;30 secs;Bright object moving almost like a circuliar rocket. I was taking a walk on out skirts of Meriden. Up out ahead of me I was a wierd shaped object almost circular, but hard to say shape.  It was around 5 in the evening and the sun was setting and the sun reflected on it and it just kept on moving toward Chesire and Southington. I only saw it for about 30 secs, but those thirty seconds were incredible they way the sun reflected of it, it wasnt like  a mirror relecting , it wasnt so bright that it hurt to look at it, it was a slight reflection. It was amazing.  I just forgot about it inventually and last night all of a sudin almost like a flash back I just like went back to that day and almost relived the moment. Thus I went online hoping to see similiar apperances, unfortunitly i was unable to. Initially i thought maybe it was the space station but it deffinitly wasnt it was about the height maybe slightly under a plane would fly.

Brightly glowing, Fast object rose veritcally then flattened out and flew past my house at speeds double anything i've seen.;2008-05-03 21:30:00;4 minutes;Brightly glowing, Fast object rose veritcally then flattened out and flew past my house at speeds double anything i've seen. My girlfriend and I were in my jacuzzi out back and I saw a light rise up from what looked to be the other side of town. About 10 15 min driving distance. It rose up from the ground straight up and while traveling upwards much like a rocket it level out once if got to what looked to the normal height of a small plane or helicopter But traveled at least twice as fast as both of these. On its way up it seemed to spiral and had a beam of light out in from of it. The UFO was bright gold, and had this gold aura all around it. It may sound strange but it seemed to have a similar shape to a plane, it had a pointed tip and two wings but the wings were pointed as well it almost looked like a star, I couldn't see the shape of the tail end it was just glowing gold, brighter than any aircraft i've ever seen. I travel towards us a bit to our left and flew overhead as it passes us we didn't hear a sound, there was total silence. The object travel of passed for another few minutes and as it got further away we saw some ireggular movements, quick side to side movement and quick up and down movements, after a bit of that it flickered to nothing and thats all I could see.;41.5343333333334;-72.8016666666666

Bright yellow fireball like light hoovered over the mountain for 15 seconds and disappeared.;2013-03-22 19:47:00;15 seconds;Bright yellow fireball like light hoovered over the mountain for 15 seconds and disappeared. I had my shades drawn.  I was sitting on my couch. I looked to my right, found strange that, what I thought to be a &quotcar light&quot did not reflect any light...I literally jumped out of the couch, as it looked like a ball of fire was shooting very slow over the mountain and streaked across...then it was gone.   I was shocked to the core.   I know what saw, it was a light that formed over the mountain and looked like a fireball bright in light not orange...hoovered over then streaked for like 15 seconds and poof it was gone;41.5343333333334;-72.8016666666666
I I noticed what looked like a fast moving fire ball shooting across the sky all of a sudden it slowed down.  ((anonymous report));2018-06-09 22:30:00;20 minutes;I was on my deck when I noticed what looked like a fast moving fire ball shooting across the sky all of a sudden it slowed down and stopped over my neighbor's house when it started to turn myself and my wife witnessed another fire ball shooting across the sky when the first fire ball turned and shot off in another direction.   A few minutes later, the second fire ball slowed down around and stopped the same exact place as the first one did then it turned in the same direction as the first one and speed off it was out of sight in just a few seconds about 5 minutes later a third speeding fire ball apaird from the same point in the sky stopped and turned in the same direction.as the first 2 this lasted about twelve to fifteen minutes.  When the first one appeared I thought it was a meteor but it could not have been one seeing it stopped and changed direction and then have two more do the same thing in the same place..
