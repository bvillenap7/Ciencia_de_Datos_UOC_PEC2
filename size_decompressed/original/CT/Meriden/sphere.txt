A downing of a UFO?;1997-06-01 20:00:00;10 min;A downing of a UFO? I was out taking pictures of the Hale-bopp comet in the evening around 8pm when the comet was in the 2 o clock position in the sky [1997]. I was parked at the runways half way point in the dirt parking area at our local airport in Meriden Conn. {Wallingford-Meriden Airport} because it is away from the city lights.  At the time I had won a camera {Cannon Sure Shot WP-1 35mm using 400 film} in some contest and I was still learning to use the different settings when something caught my eye around the full moon.  A object shaped like a large round glowing ball about 1/4 size of the moon and looked like it was just above and to the left of the moon and I saw a jet [ looked military] at the lower left side of the moon heading towards the object.  I took 4 pictures at different settings so I would have at least one good picture of what I was seeing.  By taking pictures on the different settings of the camera it shows the action with some detail on a couple of frames.  The sky was partly cloudy but it was clear towards the comet and 90degrees to the right the moon was in the clear also. The 1st picture is of the jet heading towards the object coming up from the left lower side of the moon and the object is at the upper left center of the moon.  Like if the jet was scouting the object.  The 2nd picture is of the jet coming around in a turn gaining on the object without any movement from the object.  The 3rd picture is of the jet level with the moon on the left side and looking like he was setting up a shot while closing in on the object and the object starting to go to the right just above the moon as to get away from the plane.  And the last picture was taken just after the jet fired something at the object and was starting it's turn into a dive and the object was by then in a ball of flames breaking into 2 parts on the lower right side of the picture far below the moon and almost out of frame on the right side.  One large part and a smaller piece all in a ball of flames,  You can tell by the pictures that the plane is a jet plane and the object is some type of U! FO.  I could not tell what it was, but it was not anything I have ever seen before. {Army Veteran 1979 - 85}  I did not see were the UFO went to nor the jet.  A car had past me at that time with the bright lights on.  I still have the camera that I took the pictures with, and the negitives.  No mention of this event was reported in the local papers or TV news stations.  Since then I have been checking the UFO sites for anyone who had seen this event to try to comfirm what I saw.  But nothing so far. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));41.5343333333334;-72.8016666666666

I think I was in Meriden at the time on I-691 commuting towards the I-91 connector, when I looked upward into the sky through my windshield and saw approximately 12 glowing spheres stationary in the sky, vertically one on top of another in two separate row formations.;41.5343333333334;-72.8016666666666
