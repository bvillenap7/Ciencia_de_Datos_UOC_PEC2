A very large yellow-orange disk hovered above the trees before appearing to degrade to a small round white light as it flew away. There;1975-09-10 19:45:00;2 Hours?;A very large yellow-orange disk hovered above the trees before appearing to degrade to a small round white light as it flew away. There was a time lapse involved between first sighting and take off. I was starting first grade, and remember this story well. Not knowing what i had seen, I described it to my classmates in full detail the next day, thereby I believe committing the encounter permanently to memory. I have not related this story to anyone else because, just telling my brothers about it, received so much skepticism that i allowed myself to just 'forget' that it ever happened. I am now 28 years old, have a BS in Computer Engineering, and am a partner in a Computer Engineering Consulting firm. I feel that any public knowledge of what i am about to relate could be damaging to my credibility, and wish to keep this account anonymous as far as the public is concerned. But, i also feel i must finally relate this account to an authoritative source whom may be able to quell my concerns. In retrospect, I finally identified the time lapse that took place. This concerns me more than anything, taking into account my current state of mind. I feel that this encounter, as long ago as it was, may have changed my life significantly without even recognizing it, until now. It was late summer, 1975. My parents used to let one of my three brothers and i stay up an hour later than the rest once a week. We were all within a few years in age. That night, I was not the one, and was sent to bed at seven-thirty. It was just before twilight. The sun sets later this time of year (of course). The way the bed faced, i could see outside through two large(4'x5') triple pane windows. I was almost asleep when something drew my attention outside. I opened my eyes to see what appeared to be a very large yellow-orange disk hovering above the trees. It was hard to say how far away it was. I stared at it. It made no noise, but again I was inside the house. The disk had two, relatively speaking, small bumps or turrets on the top and bottom. The sunset was beginning to turn the sky a pale red, pink color. The next thing i remember, it was pitch black outside. The disk degraded to a small round white light. At the time, i described it to my classmates as a 'headlight' (as in a car headlight). The headlight zipped away at tremendous speed, and was out of sight within seconds. What i have written here constitutes the majority of the actual experience. If this information is helpful and/or in line with current theory and phenomena, and you feel that additional information would help, i will leave my contact information. In addition to what i have written here, I feel that i have much more to add, but do not wish to waste your time with something that can only be invalid from an informed perspective. I have not disclosed this information to any other source. If i do not receive a reply i will assume that your judgement of the facts is such that this account could only be false, or merely 'all in my mind' as my brothers would say. I thank you for your time.;41.5343333333334;-72.8016666666666

Bright blue disk with two bright red lights, hovering and moving back and forth in the sky until it disappeared.;2013-10-02 19:50:00;15 seconds;bright blue disk with two bright red lights, hovering and moving back and forth in the sky until it disappeared. My boyfriend and I were sitting on our front porch when we saw a blue disk with two red lights enter into our field of vision from the right, acsending at the same speed and angle as an airplane.   After a moment, it stopped and hovered in the sky, then began to move toward us, then away a few times, then hovered again, and moved up and down a few times.  I pulled out my phone to take a video but by then it had disappeared.  Airplanes were also in the sky at the time, but this object appeared slightly larger and its lights were much more vibrant. It moved with far more precision than an airplane as well.  It was a very shocking sight for us both, neither of us had ever seen anything like it in the sky before, and we cannot think of any other explanation for it.;41.5343333333334;-72.8016666666666
