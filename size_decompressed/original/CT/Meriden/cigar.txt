Shocking.;2013-12-13 05:45:00;45 seconds;Shocking. I was coming to meriden from waterbury on i 691 at 5:45 pm.  As i was getting closer to the castle craig area exit 4 i see a bright green object that i thought was a comet.  But the green light did not fade away.   As i got closer i looked harder and realized it was a flying object. like a cigar shape With light on front of the object.  From left to right on the highway.   I think it even caused an accident as traffic was backed up.  Very  unusual for that area.   I got off the exit and drove to the little airport to see if there was any sign of traffic.  And to my supprise it looked closed to me.  I can't get the image off my head.;41.5343333333334;-72.8016666666666
Large Cigar shaped craft clearly seen.;2020-06-04 02:17:00;6-8 seconds;Large Cigar shaped craft clearly seen. The craft was clearly seen it appeared to be cigar shaped with a Half Dome on the top, it was flat on the bottom.  The length of The Craft appeared to be about the width of Two And A Half full moons.  There were no lights emitting from The Craft, the Moonlight was shining off the top and lights from a nearby City we're reflecting off the bottom.  The craft was swiftly moving from west to east at a high rate of speed and level flight.;41.5343333333334;-72.8016666666666
