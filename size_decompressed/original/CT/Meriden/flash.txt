1 blue flash & 2 green flashes of light in the Connecticut skies over highway;2003-01-02 18:50:00;6 mins;1 blue flash & 2 green flashes of light in the Connecticut skies over highway This happened on the way home from work tonight. Driving on the Merit PKWY /RT 15 (between 6:45pm & 7pm) driving from Woodbridge Conn. to Middletown Conn. In the sky (between the 1st exits for Wallingford area & exits for Meriden) I saw 3 very strange flashes of light. The 1st flash was light blue with random pattern,,,sort of like faint lighting.About a minute and half later, there was a stronger flash in the same area of the sky but this time it was a light green. Then approx 2-3 mins.later there was another much stronger & brighter green flash of light. The flashes where either in or above the clouds so except for the colors it may have seemed like lighting. But I've traveled this road for ten years, every Monday-Friday and never seen anything like it. Really was quite unnerving. Did anyone else seen this occurence or has anyone seen this before?;41.5343333333334;-72.8016666666666
