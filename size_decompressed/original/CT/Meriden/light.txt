Why I say this is there is no aircraft then or now that could duplicate what unfolded next.The two brillantly red circlular objects appeared to start to vibrate then its hard to explain they started jumping all over the sky back and forth up and down around each other in circles at incredible speeds then as fast as it started they stopped in a blink of an eye side by side just as they had when they rose up from behind the trees.Again I must say there was absolutely no sound while this is going on.As I said earlier no manmade object could duplicate what I witnessed.Then the object on the left started to vibrate again and went from a brillant red to a shimmering orange. I would say the change from red to orange took about 10 seconds and then the object shot straight up into the sky and was gone in one second.Then the 2nd object repeated the same process but didnt go to a brillant orange just a dull orange then it went back to a brillant red and shot at incredible speed climbing into the southeastern sky then stop on a dime. I would have to say at this point it was over 10,000 ft in the air.It then dropped back down a little bit and shot down towards South Meridens markham airport below.I must say I am almost 40 yrs old and I can still see the event as it happened yesterday.The only thing I`m a little fuzzing on is the exact day on which it took place.I do recall that we ran down to my house at the bottom of Sidehill road  all excited telling my parents and their friends what had just happened so they let us call the police station and the local news station to report it.As you can imagine the people on the other end of the phoneline just laughed at me.

My friend and I were sitting at home on my deck whatching the eclipse on November 8,2003. While whatching it we saw something that looked like a flock of gease, but it could not have been because it was very dark and silent we herd absolut silence.There were three rows the middle row shorter then the other two.They were in a v-shape and were a brownish-blue color and glowing.There were at least 20-30 lights fliying together so perfect.They were flying quite fast then all of a sudden it changed shapes. It had went from its v-shape to an oval like shape then right back to its original shape so perfect and absolute as if it never left its shape.Then it flew away past my house into the dark.The next day my friend and I went to the library to reaserch what we saw, looking in two UFO books we saw the same thing we saw that night. It was called the Luddock Light. ((NUFORC Note:  Please see numerous other reports.  PD));41.5343333333334;-72.8016666666666
zig zag light, with a green after glow;2020-08-30 21:40:00;15 minutes;zig zag light, with a green after glow I was walking my dog and noticing how clear the night sky was.  Suddenly a ball of light bounced up from the horizon and stopped. I thought I was seeing things and just kept starring at the light. It stood still, so I brushed it off as a star and kept walking, but kept my eye on it, after 20 seconds, the light started zig zagging, thought maybe it was a drone, suddenly the light stopped moving, turned off, and you can see a green light (almost like electricity) flickering where the light was..  after 20 seconds the light came back and lit up the entire sky, from that moment I could tell that the light was actually in space, because it lit up the space around it as if it was some sort of explosion, allowing you to gauge the distance.. and it was reallly far... then the light when back to it's normal light and continued to zig zag before heading east really fast.;41.5343333333334;-72.8016666666666
