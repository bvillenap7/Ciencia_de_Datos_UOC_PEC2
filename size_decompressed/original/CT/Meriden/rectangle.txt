The object was Black, looked like a flattened accordian.  The sun glistened off it as it slowly turned and hovered.  I noticed it inside my house as I looked out the  big window walking down the stairs.   I saw a flash in the sky. I went outside and saw it.  I grabbed binoculars and watched it.  I tried to film it with my phone but got nothing,it was too far.  It eventually went up and was gone.  It was not a balloon.;41.5343333333334;-72.8016666666666
