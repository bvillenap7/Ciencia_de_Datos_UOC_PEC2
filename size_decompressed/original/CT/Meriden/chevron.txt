White Chevron shaped object  flies faster than a jet, does loop and disappears;2020-08-01 10:50:00;20 seconds;white Chevron shaped object  flies faster than a jet, does loop and disappears This occurred 5 minutes after I saw the Black shiny object in the same part of a clear blue sky.  I went back outside to see if I could see any more of the object that I had just saw.  I was looking up in the sky and I saw to my left a white chevron shaped object appear.  I watched it thinking it was a seagull.  But a seagull wouldn't be in the central part of Ct.  It wasnt. It was solid and it flew on an upward trajectory then accelerated to a speed greater than any jet I have seen.  It flew right up where the Black object had dissappeared,  did a loop dloop, and zipped up so fast I looked around to see if any of my neighbors had seen it. It was that crazy fast.  Then it was gone.;41.5343333333334;-72.8016666666666
