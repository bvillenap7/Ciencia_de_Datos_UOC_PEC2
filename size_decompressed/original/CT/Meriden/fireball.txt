I went to dd and on my way back down east Main Street the balls of fire had separated.  I proceeded to follow them when I saw another person on the side of the road taking video of these objects with his phone.  I stopped to speak to this gentleman and he too saw what I was seeing.

Giant light falls from the sky.;2015-11-26 18:05:00;2 seconds;Giant light falls from the sky. I was sitting on my front step in South Meriden at between 6:00pm and 6:15pm, facing north when I saw a large bright fireball shoot straight down out of the night sky.  It looked like it may have landed near Meriden Square or the mountains near there.  My first thought was that it was a missle but there was no explosion.  The sky was too hazy for me to have seen a meteorite from that distance.  It was definitely too large to be a meteorite, and if it was we would have heard or felt it hit the ground.  Very alarming!;41.5343333333334;-72.8016666666666
