We were driving in a small sports car on River Rd. near Red Bridge. I saw what I thought was the reflection of my shifter light on the windshield. I realized I was seeing something reflecting on the windshield from the outside. I pulled over, stopped my car and opened the window. Just above the tops of the telephone poles was an enormous diamond shaped craft. It was so close I could see that the surface looked like the dull side of aluminium foil. The underside had two bullet shaped ducts side by side with heat emitting from them. Maybe propulsion? No sound what so ever came from this craft. Around the perimeter was a redish/pink fuzzy difused light. The craft was traveling very slow. I wondered how it was staying in the air. It followed large high tension wires toward Hubbard park and was gone.   Totally unforgetable. I hope to witness again. I honestly felt no fear, only awe..;41.5343333333334;-72.8016666666666
