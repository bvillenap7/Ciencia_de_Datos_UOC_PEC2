saw a bizzare star at 3:30 am;2002-07-31 03:30:00;1 hour;saw a bizzare star at 3:30 am I was sleeping and i woke up to use the bathroom. When i went back to bed i looked out of the sliding doors up into a southeast sky. There apeared to only be one star. But as i stared longer i noticed it was blinking like a plane only not so fast. It was hovering. so i watched longer as a plane crossed its path and blocked it from my sight. It was still there and keeping me awake , so i got annoyed at it. Then it seemed to jerk up then back down then it jerked to the left in weird circular motion.But it never left so i fell back asleep. Earlier that evening i saw a shooting star type thing to the northwest. It didnt have a trail like other shooting stars do. And it  didnt just disapear like shooting stars do. it crossed the sky a distance before it disapeared. i thought nothing of it until my sighting.;41.6425;-73.30885
