Square (or diamond) shaped object flying then hovering at a low altitude;2020-01-15 19:50:00;10 minutes;Square (or diamond) shaped object flying then hovering at a low altitude My husband and I were driving south from Washington, Ct toward Roxbury on Bell Hill rd. I noticed an orange light in the sky that seemed to be fairly low and moving at a slow speed. As we got closer (driving at approx. 30mph) I stuck my head out of the window to see it going overhead. As we went over it I noticed the object was square (or diamond) shaped with a white light at the front , a red light at each corner (two sides and rear). As we stopped at an intersection to take a look we didnâ€™t not notice any sound though it appeared to be flying lower than usual aircraft (at about the same altitude that one might see a small prop plane).  We continued driving down the road for about a mile when we pulled over to try to see the object again.  We spotted the same flashing orange light that I noticed on our initial approach in the distance. We watched it for about 5 minutes and though it was far away, the  object did not appear to move.  I was trying to judge its ! movement based on its proximity to a large tree that was in the foreground.  It stayed in the same place until we got back in the car and left.;41.6425;-73.30885
