Two diamond shaped objects over 84 Southington;2014-12-15 17:45:00;45 seconds;Two diamond shaped objects over 84 Southington While merging onto 84 east from Cheshire into Southington, my daughter and I saw two diamond shaped objects hovering above the highway.  One of the objects was higher in the air while one was closer to the ground.  The two objects were a light golden color that pulsed every 2-3 seconds.   My daughter saw one of the objects change to red in color.  The event happened very quickly as I stated earlier I was entering the highway and exited at the first exit there after.  I did see several other planes in the air at least one seemed to be a small passenger plane. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.  PD));41.6047;-72.8813
