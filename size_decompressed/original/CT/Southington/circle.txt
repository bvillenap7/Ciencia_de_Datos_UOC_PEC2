Noticed 2 objects moving across the sky,then started to loop in circles following each other over lapping one another.  Every time they circled in the direction of the sun they reflected like they were so sort of shiny alloy.  By time I called a coworker over they vanished.  No trails,  No sound, moving very fast flying in jet territory.;41.6047;-72.8813
