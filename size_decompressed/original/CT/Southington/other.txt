While I was visiting my friend Me And 2 other individuals walked along the street at night with only the light of the 2 street lights to guide us when we spotted a green and a red light directly next to each other with no space between them.  For 2 or so minutes we looked at the lights as they moved through the sky with only a little motion.   After a while one of the people with me pulled out a camera but the lights were not picked up by the camera.  After that, we walked away just to notice they where following us slowly.  We picked up the pace as it disappeared in the treeline.   After walking down the road, we saw it again for a short moment before it rapidly descended into the trees.  This could not have been a helicopter because we couldn't hear it, and it moved in circles, unlike a plane.   We rushed home and filled out this report as fast as we could.;41.6047;-72.8813
