Square / triangle in shape with 4 white lights at each point and light blue lights going around it.;2003-03-01 04:10:00;5 seconds;Square / triangle in shape with 4 white lights at each point and light blue lights going around it. It was 4:10 in the morning, We were on our way to our second job (cleaning offices).  We were going North on 395.  We approached exit 88, and I looked to my right (East) toward the apple orchard - that is when I saw it!!!!!  It above the apple orchard building (NOT the field) on RT 14.  It was square and triangular in shape - like a square that had 2 of the 4 points pulled away (place forefingers together and thumbs together - this is the shape) - like this <> - but all lines were connected together.  There were lights at each point in the square and a band of light blue lights that connected the 4.  The 4 lights were bright white, and the blue lights were moving around the craft.  I believe it to be the underside that I saw.  The sky was full of stars - in the center of the craft was blackness.  I yelleded at my husband to stop and go back so we could look at it.  We argued for a few minutes.  He was telling me that he couldn't because we would be late for work - he later admitted to being affraid.  He did not see it at all, but knew by my reactions that I did see something that he didn't want to see.  It was not moving at all - just hovering above RT14.  I heard no sound at all.  Looking at it from a distance of about 300 feet it looked to be 50 feet along all 4 sides (total feet 200 around the craft) this was NOT small at all!!!!!  I would have to guess a few foot ball fields large in size.;41.7171;-71.8847
