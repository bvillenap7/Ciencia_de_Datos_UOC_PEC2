Sighting over Southern Newtown, CT;2001-09-05 23:20:00;1 minute;Sighting over Southern Newtown, CT At 2320 on 9/5 I heard something in the house which caused me to investigate.  After searching and on my way to bed, I looked out my front door window which looks down the street.  I immediately noticed an exceptionally bright light 2000-3000 feet high and approximately 5 miles away.  I thought this was an aircraft, which have holding patterns over this part of Connecticut.  I continued looking because the light was so bright I wondered what type of aircraft it could be. The light was at least 20 times brighter than an aircraft's landing light. The object then starting moving up and down, mimicing an oscilliscope wave.  My binoculars were 10 feet away and I ran to get them.  Upon returning to the window and before I could get the binoculars out of the case the object moved straight up (maybe 5 degrees off of vertical) at a speed that was so incredibly fast I knew it was no aircraft.  It also left, only for a few milliseconds, a white phosphorous trail that had to be at least 10,000 feet long.  It then disappeared into the CLEAR night.;41.3948000000003;-73.3214000000007
