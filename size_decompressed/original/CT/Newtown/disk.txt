One hovering object above the swamp at the corner of Judd Road and Hattertown Road.  It was hovering over one place, moved slightly to the right then proceeded forward heading northeast.  The object was just above the tree line, with multiple lights on it.   I was on my way home from a meeting, and only a few minutes from my house when I noticed the lights and originally thought it was a cell phone tower I had never noticed before, and slowed down and stopped when I noticed that it was in fact moving.   I did not open the car windows or get out to try and listen for any noise.;41.3948000000003;-73.3214000000007
