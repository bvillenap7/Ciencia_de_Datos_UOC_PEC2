Light object with red, green, and golden lights changing shape in the SE sky in Newtown, CT. ((NUFORC Note:  Antares??  PD));2007-06-11 21:40:00;5 minutes;Light object with red, green, and golden lights changing shape in the Southeastern sky in Newtown, Connecticut. I was on my back deck when I noticed a circular object in the Southeastern sky with red and green strobe lights. It appeared to be a couple of miles away at a 20º angle. At first glance, I thought it was a plane, but when it didn’t move, I got my binoculars for a better look. What I saw was remarkable. To the naked eye, it appeared that it was an object with lights on it and was stationary. When I looked at it through the binoculars, I saw an object, made of red, green, and golden lights. They jumped around and changed shapes. At first it was circular, then elongated, then it stretched from side to side, then it extended into an arch, zig zagging, spiraling. Back and forth the lights changed shapes. I wondered at that point if my hands were shaking causing this to happen, so I steadied my arms on the deck railing. The lights continued to transform into all different shapes. What was interesting was that the lights were very bright, almost neon in nature. I called for my husband to take a look, and he was perplexed as to what it might be. I don’t know what we saw last night, but it was extraordinary. We watched this for about five minutes, then the clouds rolled in obscuring our view. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the witness may have been observing the star, Antares, which is in the SE sky, currently, at approximately 20 degrees angle of elevation.

bright star like light, shoots across sky, changes directions and then vanishes.;2008-06-21 22:00:00;5 seconds;bright star like light, shoots across sky, changes directions and then vanishes. A bright light in the sky caught my attention, it appeared to be a star but a little larger and brighter, it proceeded to cross the sky for about 3 seconds at a pace much faster then a plane, but slower than a shooting star, it then quickly changed direction and vanished into the night, leaving a trail of light behind it. I have never seen anything like this.;41.3948000000003;-73.3214000000007
Hovering, flickering light in the sky that moved erratically;2012-01-05 03:30:00;40 minutes;Hovering, flickering light in the sky that moved erratically I came home around 3:20AM, parked my car and went up to bed. The blinds were open and I was lying there, looking out the window. The clouds were low on the horizon, over the tree line and only to the right of my view. The rest of the sky was black and the stars were visible. Off to my left, over the tree line and definitely very far off, I saw a round orb of bright light that seemed to hover, flicker and change color. I thought it was just a pretty star until it moved up and to the left. I continued watching it and it would hover in one place, then move slowly, almost lazily, in an erratic pattern but staying in the same general area. I know it was moving because at one point, it dipped below the tree line and I could still see it's brightness through the branches, then it would reappear above the tree line. The light was bright and orb-shaped with a flickering quality to it. It seemed to change colors, but as if it was covered with several different lights - like a Christmas tree. It would also fade and disappear completely and then reappear. Again, there was no cloud cover in that part of the sky and I could clearly see the stars out. This continued for 40 minutes and the light seemed to hover and move erratically in the same general area. I wanted to get a camera or something, but I was too afraid. I will look for it again and try to get some video or pictures of it.;41.3948000000003;-73.3214000000007
