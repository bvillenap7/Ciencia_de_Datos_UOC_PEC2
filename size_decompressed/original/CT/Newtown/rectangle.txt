5 lights 4 white 1 red rectangle;2010-12-10 01:30:00;1 min or less;5 lights 4 white 1 red rectangle I was in my car driving home at 1:30am, north bound on poverty hollow road about 2 or three miles from hatter town road.  At first I thought it was a plane just flying past but the issue was it was moving to slow and it had NO flashers or port/starboard indicators(green/red). The craft was comprised of 5 lights in total, 4 white/yellow on the 4 corners and a red on in the center. I am about 50% sure this was possibly a helicopters however there was no significant noise of a rotary blade and not a single flasher or navigation related light. The craft craft was moving at about 1.5x my velocity(30 to 40mph) in terms of angle it was only gaining a couple of degrees on my sight as I moved north north west. What struck me as odd was when it banked over to the east it moves rather gracefully and again I got a good solid look at it to confirmed the lack of general aviation lights. It was also a good indication that if it was a private aircraft it would have been flying rather low, 2k feat at best. other wise it would have had to have a large wing span if was indeed at higher altitudes. given its observ! ed attributes and movement I was shocked at the lack of noise. and the paradox between observed movement and luminary characteristics.  Again it could have just been an air plane but I have seen so many over the years this one just didn't make sense. I play a lot of video games and some of them are 3d flying games and also 3d space type games so judging angular velocity is a skill I have, this object defied many of the general definitions I have for normal air craft. It didn't move in a way that caused alarm but the combination of the lights and lack of flashers and indicators along with its graceful back was cause for concern.;41.3948000000003;-73.3214000000007
