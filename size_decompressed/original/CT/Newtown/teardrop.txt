About 300 yards away hovering right over the trees in my back yard was a strange shape. it was a FAT tear drop , kind of like the space craft in independance day (I saw the movie 4 months LATER)It hovered for a while and I thought it was a helicopter at first , but I opened the door and I heard nothing.I have seen ALOT of helicopters even farther away and heard them.So I knew it was either a new , silent helicopter , or a UFO.Then , things started getting wierd , a strange blue aurora surrounded it and 2 lights , one red and one green , they went from opposite sides and hit each other , probably an antimatter reaction,then it sent out a beam and went into an orb formed by it. Finally it sped off in the orb so fast and at such a strange angle I was mezmorized. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness would have been in the second grade at the time of the sighting.

Strange craft appeared in sky , then zoomed away;1996-12-15 18:30:00;1 minute;Strange craft appeared in sky , then zoomed away I was walking in my basement one night and looked out of my sliding glass door.There was a strange shape out right over the trees , I estimate 300 yards away.It was a fat teardrop , sort of like the craft from independance day (I saw that movie 4 months AFTER the sighting).I thought it was a helicopter at first , then opened the door and heard nothing.I had seen helicopters from that distance before and heard them , loud and clear , so I knew it was either a silent , new helicopter ,or an alien space craft.Then a blue aurora surrounded the object and 2 white lights turned on , on the sides of the craft. Then it shot off on a very odd , diagnol angle, at an INCREDIBLE speed.;41.3948000000003;-73.3214000000007
