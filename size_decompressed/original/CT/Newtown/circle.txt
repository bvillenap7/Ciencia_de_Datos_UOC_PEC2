Classic cartoon flying saucer over Newtown woods;2005-01-24 07:00:00;10 sec;Classic cartoon flying saucer over Newtown woods The object appeared hovering at a 45 degree angle above the woods behind my house. Not sure how high up the craft was but the trees are about 30 feet high.  From my point of vision, the craft was about 2 inches across. The craft was shaped like a classic cartoon flying saucer -- round with colored lights all around it and a bubble shape on top. It appeared silver. It was silent and still for several seconds while the orange, red, yellow, and green square-shaped lights  circled around it. It is unclear if the craft itself was spinning. I looked away and it was gone.;41.3948000000003;-73.3214000000007

Today January 6, 2007 at approx 12:40 pm while on break from my job in southwestern Connecticut, (today is sunny and 68*)  I had heard a jet plane.  Looking in the west sky I saw a large passanger jet, I then out of my left eye, what I thouth to be a milar balloon due to the sun hitting it just right saw a round metalic object from the south it moved so fast that as quickly as I saw it fly in a northern direction.   HIS WAS NOT A PLANE!  Its speed was that of which I have NEVER seen any other aircraft's, just for the record I have never before used this or anyother website to report a UFO.  This is the first and last time I hope to ever see one again.  I do wonder if anyone elese saw the UFO I am reporting.;41.3948000000003;-73.3214000000007
