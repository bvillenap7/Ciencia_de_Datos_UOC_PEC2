Orange-ish lights floating in the sky on Sunday, May 26th, in Seymour, Connecticut;2013-05-26 20:30:00;unknown;Orange-ish lights floating in the sky on Sunday, May 26th, in Seymour, Connecticut I was driving home from my mothers house and while on the highway I saw six or seven orange/red/yellow lights spread across the sky.  This lights weren't necessarily flashing,  but they seems to be different colors combined, and at certain times one color was more distinct than the others.  They moved slowly, if at all.  They moved very little, but would move in all directions.  The same light would be slowly drifting east, then it would move west, then north or south.  It seemed like everyone on the road was slowing down and looking, as you couldn't miss them unless you weren't paying any attention.  I even posted something on Facebook when it happened.  I heard this mentioned today on Coast to Coast AM, which compelled me to write this report.   You should feel free to contact me via email if you feel it to be necessary.;41.3885;-73.0791
