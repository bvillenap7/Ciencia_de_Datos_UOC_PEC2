Traveling lights over Seymour, CT;2007-07-07 22:45:00;20 min;Traveling lights over Seymour, CT Over a 20 minute period we observed 3 balls of light(looked to be a moving star) traveling very high and fast over Seymour, CT. The sky was clear and starry. The lights were approximately 5to 8 minutes appart. The first and third lights traveled in a North to South direction. The second light traveled east to west. The lights did not blink but appeared to be at a higher altitude than any plane. The lights appeard out of nowhere. Each light was able to be observed for approx. 5 to 10 seconds each. The third light seemed to change direction and traveled up and away from Earth. There was no haze or trail of any sort around or near the objects.;41.3885;-73.0791

When it came to the house across the street I waited for it to come out of sight from the 2 large trees but it never appeared.  This is the 2nd time I have seen this in the early morning and it is traveling way too low to be an airplane plus there was no sound.;41.3885;-73.0791
