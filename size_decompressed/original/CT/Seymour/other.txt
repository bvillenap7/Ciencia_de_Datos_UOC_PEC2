I live at a high elevation and the stars were very bright. As I stared at the stars I noticed an unusually bright blinking object. It was brighter than the other stars and was blinking with numerous colors at a high rate of intervals, unlike the lights of a plane or jet. I told my wife that I thought it was strange and asked her to come out. I retreived my binoculiars (Belle Howell 8x40 extra wide angle) and was in awe at what I could see. There was a bright circuliar light with what looked like four or five rapidly blinking lights. The object was stationary and not emitting any noise. I could not believe what I was seeing. Words cannot describe, I wish more people were there to witness this--- whatever, I dont know what it was. I then went next door and woke my neighbors and let them look through the binoculiars, there reaction was the same as mine. I called the local airport in Oxford to see if it was a weather balloon.They told methat there were no weather balloons in the area. I have some of it on video. I am not a pro so the picture did not come out to to good, but good enough. The object had moved further away at this point. After about a half hour it vanished. I hope to take it somewhere and see if they can clear up the picture. It was at night so you can not make out any clear shape. I hope to see it again.
