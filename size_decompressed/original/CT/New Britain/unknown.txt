I was driving home from a friends house at 12:30 at night. I looked up as I slowed to a stop sign and saw it. It seemed too large to be a meteor but was still very high up and far away. The light was a chrome blue and vibrant, never changing color. At first when I fixated on it it was still, like an oversized star. Almost immediately after I registered that thought it shot off quickly and slightly curving away from my position heading directly North. I have seen many meteors in my life and immediately I felt a chill as it was unlike any I had seen. There was also no trail or light distortion as it moved across the sky just a solid light. I lost sight of the light as it passed into the tree line.;41.6758352941177;-72.7878088235294
