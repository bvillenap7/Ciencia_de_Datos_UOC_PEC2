saw a silent, huge, black, triangle shape object floating and flying in the sky with lights;2006-03-15 21:00:00;4 minutes;saw a silent, huge, black, triangle shape object floating and flying in the sky with lights I saw what I have seen many people describe on other sites and on this one - it was a triangle (black) and in the corners it had white lights and a circle light in the center.  It was COMPLETELY SILENT and appeared to float across the sky and many times just stood still - not moving.   It was low in the sky then went past my mom's 3 family house to where I couldn't see it anymore - my mom and I saw it.  It was unlike anything I've ever seen before - oh and it was huge - bigger than you'd think could fly in the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Large triangle formation;2017-12-12 18:00:00;2 minutes;Large triangle formation I was letting my dog out in the backyard when I got home from work.  I was walking around the pool patio and was looking up over the roof line of my house and it appeared that 3 stars in the shape of a triangle started moving.  Since I was walking, I stopped in place kinda wondering what I was watching and wanted to make sure I was actually seeing the lights move.  The triangle formation continued to move towards the east fairly slowly and appeared to be somewhat high in the air but appeared to be about 3-4 inches in length from where I stood so, would have to be enormous up close.  The object just quietly moved towards the east and each of the 3 lights gradually diminished One by one. It just looked like a very large triangle  of stars moving.;41.6758352941177;-72.7878088235294
