Diamond-shaped craft with two orange lights hovering in the sky  before fading and vanishing.;2008-01-04 20:44:00;20:48;Diamond-shaped craft with two orange lights hovering in the sky  before fading and vanishing. It was clear and cloudless night in my town and I was outside with my sister when I noticed a strange looking airplane to the north of our neighborhood flying at about 2,000 ft. It was distinctly diamond-shaped and had two small orange glowing lights facing us (the light to the right was slightly higher than the left).  At this point I was sure this was neither airplane nor helicopter as airplanes in my area have green, white, red, or blue lights and make very detectable sounds at night as do helicopters. It was also much too large to be a helicopter or a small airplane. The craft was moving unbelievably slow, almost as if it were hovering. After a couple of minutes of observation the orange lights started to fade until the whole craft including lights and silhouette disappeared completely. Again, this was a clear night so it had nothing to hide behind.  Note: My sister would not like to be contacted about this report/information.;41.6758352941177;-72.7878088235294
A group of round white balls like objects with mothership!;2020-11-16 22:00:00;15 min;A group of round white balls like objects with mothership! My husband and 7yr old heard a noise outside. Upon going to back porch to check it out we witnessed what appeared to be a spaceship. Many objects, light likes just going in a circular motion. Overall shape of activity was like a diamond shape or a spinning type. The objects appeared in color of a light bulb and as they moved in a circular motion the center was dimmed but remained still. At some point we saw lights shoot outward like a light explosion but in a very organized fashion like a burst of water. The width of the shape formed by these lights/objects had to be at least 10ft wide and was about 1-2 blocks away from our home but due to the large size it seems as if it was right next door.;41.6758352941177;-72.7878088235294
