Bright neon green ball of light flew across sky;2007-07-15 22:30:00;10 seconds;Bright neon green ball of light flew across sky My son and I were driving home late at night in the car and a sudden VERY bright neon green ball of light went flying super fast across the sky.  It was a green color unlike any I've ever seen.  We both saw it and were afraid to say anything right away cause of almost shock.  We both looked at eachother and said, Did you see that?  We both said what we saw and talked about how fast it flew.  There was no possible way it was an aircraft of known nature cause of how fast it flew.  Very strange.  Never saw anything like it.  My son said he has seen what he thought were meteors at a farm we go to in the night sky - but this was nothing like it.;41.6758352941177;-72.7878088235294

15-18 Red/Orange orbs moving across the sky that disappeared quickly along with a single white light that lingered for a few minutes.;2013-09-26 07:30:00;25 minutes;15-18 Red/Orange orbs moving across the sky that disappeared quickly along with a single white light that lingered for a few minutes. There were three red/orange orb like lights moving in a triangular pattern, and when they disappeared, two more came. After those two disappeared, three came and followed the same path as the others.  One really bright white light appeared and lingered for at least 8 minutes as more and more started appearing, always at the same path at very high speed.  Definitely too fast to be planes.  All of the red/orange ones that appeared seemed to move higher in the air and eventually just completely disappeared.  Once the Bright white one was gone, only a few more showed up and then it was over.;41.6758352941177;-72.7878088235294

The pulsating lights were red and blue almost looked like drones checking out the strange triangular light showed.
